2,Not that impressed,"I was not that impressed with this book or any of the Sears' books. When we found out I was having twins we quickly bought all the books that we thought would help. Thier books are wordy and not to the point. They also make you feel like a child abuser if you occasionally give your baby, or babies, a bottle or binkie. This book did have a few good suggestions but not enough that I would recommend it.....especially for mothers of twins or anyone with unusual circumstances. just so you know, my twins are four months and I am still breastfeeding. Good luck to you."
1,Horrible book,"I hated this book. I didn't even read the whole thing because it was boring and I did not like the Sears views on mothers who give their babies formula. I read The Everything Breastfeeding Book and I loved it. I was never bored. My baby was in the NICU and her first night she was given bottles. The second day she was given my pumped milk in bottles and formula because my milk was not all the way in yet. My baby would not latch on when we got home so my mom bought me the Medela nipple shields to use and that is how I breast feed my baby. The Sears would call me a horrible mother because I ""didn't try hard enough"" but I really did all I could it just didn't work so I made it work with soem help from a nipple shield."

1,I want to burn this book!,"This book is so unrealistic. When weaning is mentioned, they suggest you are weaning a toddler or preschooler. Cloth diapers seem to be the norm as is NOT working. This book is not for someone who wants to leave the house in the first year or go back to work. I wish I had never purchased this book and I plan to throw it out!!!"
5,excellent survey,"This book is an invaluable resource for scholars and amateurs alike. The introductory essay orients the reader, and the photographs tell their own story.The ""reviewer"" below this is clearly insane and/or has an ax to grind. As any of their Yale students could tell you, Spence and Chin are both world-class scholars whose passion is narrating the stories of modern China accessibly, entertainingly, and provocatively."
2,Difficult and Not Easy To Understand at Times,"Some of the time the instruction and material was just fine. But then something was introduced that seemed out of place or not well explained. Some rewording and some reorganizing is needed in ""The complete Idiot's Guild to Chess"". There is no problem with it having a lot in it, it is just how it is presented and explained. After looking around I ended up with a complete beginner's guild to chess that was directed at my age, easy to understand and had lots of material."
5,Chess,I want to learn chess so bad and I'm making it my goal this year to learn..new board...new book...wish me luck!!!
4,THE Beginner's Guide,"Without doubt, Patrick Wolff's Idiot's Guide is the beginner's book most recommended to newbies by serious chessplayers in the United States."
3,Good start!!,fun read... but could use bit more tension and suspense in the Story. But still worth buying if for nothing else as book 1 in the EVIL DEAD comic. Plus the art is fantastic and the story IS groovy.
5,Love The Evil Dead Series,Just have one thing to ask though. What comics come in here is it all of the Ashes 2 Ashes or is it half?
1,Not So Good...,"After convincing my wife that this would be a good buy, I was very, very dissapointed. After setting up the unit and flushing through 3 ice cycles I was ready to savor instant ice without having to fight the ice cubes from ice boxes. Urggh !! The ice has got an awful smokey flavor to it. It tastes like I have used liquid smoke to make these cubes, even after trying it with bottled water."
5,Excellent Lebanese coffee!,"I and my wife are frequent at Lebnan Zaman, our local Lebanese restaurant, and we always get coffee with cardamon. Now we can make it at home any time we want."
4,Great CD,"This CD is a nice mix of older music & new releases from Trout Fishing in America. My favorite cuts are The Last Day of Pompeii, Baby's Got the Car Keys and The Number of that Truck. Trout is incredible in concert -- so much music for 2 guys -- but on this CD I wish they had skipped the speaking portions of the live performance (really a minor criticism). This is another solid performance from Trout Fishing in America."
5,great company,I would definately recommend this company to others. I recieved the item within a couple of days of ordering. I wanted a larger size and they accepted the return and shipped out the new item quickly. Great company and terrific robe
1,Never shipped or emailed me!,"This seller never shipped or contacted me about my item. All I would see is that it is ""shipping soon""."
3,Good resource,This is a good resource for those who are interested in learning about the different subfields in psychology.
1,pastic housing does not last long,"Very bad experience with the product. The valve covering is made of plastic and does not stand heat that well. Within 5 months of daily use, the covering and the valve (also made of plastic) broke off. I will not recommend this unit if you looking for daily use."
5,spine tingling great performances,I put all these sonatas performed by Rubinstein along with the same ones performed by Van Cliburn and Rudolf Serkin onto a dsic and have enjoyed listening and comparing. Today I put together a Rubinstein concerto disc and had almost 25 minutes of filler space at the end and added the 23rd sonata. I have listened many times to this performance and have yet to make it through the 3rd movement without a BIG chill going up and down my spine. WOW!Most of my CD-Rs have one of Beethoven's named sonatas at the end if there is filler space. It is music I cannot get enough of and never grow tired of.
3,"Disappointing, but not surprising.","Rubinstein remains one of my favorite pianists. His Chopin Nocturnes would be one of my ""desert island"" recordings, and the Waltz's not far being. His Beethoven Concerto #4 remains supreme.But these -- the Moonlight has none of the inwardness that makes the piece what it is (and so amazing in its historical context). The pedalling in the Apassionata in somewhat strange, and some of the tempi in the Pathetique awkward.Wait for the re-release of Rubinstein doing the late Beethoven sonatas -- now those will be worth owning!"
3,Not Sure,"I can't tell if it is the recording or his actual playing that doesn't have enough dynamics. It sounded too soft for Beethoven's musics. I am a huge fan of Rubinstein on Chopin, so I easily believed he could play just anybody's work. Now I am not sure if it is the case. But I don't regret owning this cd. Afterall, Rubinstein is a legend."
5,"definitive performances, but you might as well order 11 disc box for the same price",Other reviews eloquently make the case for this recording. Just wanted customers to know that amazon offers the 11cd Rubinstein Chopin box for the same price. Includes a booklet with notes and 9 other fine CDs... an excellent bargain.
5,This CD turned me on to classical piano,"Still my favorite piano album of all time. I moved a few years ago and lost all my CD's, and because of financial problems have only recently begun to repurchase many recordings. When I bought this again and listened to it after a few years away, I could have cried. It was like meeting an old love, and none of the thrill was gone. She was as beautiful as ever. Rubinstein's sense of rubato is perfect; affective and full of rhythm within rhythm, yet only consciously noticeable when you carefully examine the playing. Totally natural. Like Liszt said of Chopin's rubato, ""See that tree? See how the leaves move yet the shape stays the same?"" The tone is bold and sharp, proving that Chopin's music was not to be maudlinly caressed as the stereotype of a weak, tubercular genius has perpetuated. This is music to lay in the dark with, not to sleep, but to ride the night blanket away in."
5,Arthur Rubenstein - Chopin 19 Nocturnes (Vol. 49),"Arthur Rubenstein interprets Chopin beautifully with great emotion. It would have been interesting, were it possible, to have him play these great works in the presence of Chopin to get his reaction. The ""Red Seal"" RCA label lives up to it reputation for having made some of the very best quality recordings ever made. The crisp, clear and true to the original sound makes you feel as though you were in the studio while the recording was being made."
3,Exquisite Tone Flawed By Uneven Tempos,"Although Rubinstein's tone and articulation are exquisite, the sometimes excessive rubato and uneven tempos interfere with the natural flow of the music. Too often, he lingers over a note instead of moving on, or plays a staccato note instead of letting the sound resonate. The result can be a disjointed, halting effect that detracts from the rhythm.Although many people feel Rubinstein's interpretation of the Nocturnes is similar to the way Chopin played them, the fact that Chopin always kept a metronome on his piano speaks for itself. Nevertheless, Rubinstein was one of the greatest pianists the world has ever known and is always worth listening to."
5,The best Nocturnes ever,I bought this 30 years ago on vinyl and have heard many other interpretations since then. I re-installed my turntable recently and thus could hear the Nocturnes by Rubinstein again. They are simply the best I have ever heard.
2,piano for the kindergarden,i haven't the slightest idea why all these people rated this so high...same for all other rubinstein discs.firstly lets mention most were recorded in the 50s/60s.not exactly superb in terms of sound and his playing certainly boasts a diminshed sense of craft/despair.lifelessness in these pieces.Mr. rubenstein does not have the right chemistry to be playing chopin.he plays quite off rhythm sometimes and dilutes the piece.Call it 'interpretation' but it bothers my ears and makes me think of how the piece should have been played instead of getting me to that 'sensous' point of being carried away.i wasted a lot of money on a good deal of this collection buying all at once and basically putting faith in all the reviews.dont make the same mistake!-id go with the piano collection on naxos....
2,Not thrilled,"I put the strips on the recliner last night. I had a hard time getting them to stay put. the slightest touch of my finger pulled it right off. This morning the cat had mangled one of the strips. I knew which cat did it because I could hear ""sticky"" on his paws when he walked through the kitchen. Time will tell if he will leave the chair alone. I'm not thrilled at the idea of replacing the strips every day, but if it stops the clawing before I run out of strips (I've already used 6 out of 24), then fine. He's a stubborn little cuss, and I doubt this will break his habit. I wish the adhesive back were stronger. It does not adhere well to fabric."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,VERY HARD TO USE.. CAN'T GET THE STRIPS OFF OF THE PAPER.. WOULD BUY SOMETHING ELSE NEXT TIME.CANT TELL IF THE STRIPS ARE ON THE FURNITURE OR NOT
4,Good for training cats to not scratch,"I have an original womb chair that I just reupholstered and it's my oldest cats favorite thing to scratch. All of my cats have claw caps but he's particularly good at picking them off and there will often be a few claws free that he uses. I started using a spray can to train him to not scratch the chair, but he still does it sometimes when no ones around. He's very smart. I applied 8 or so of these all over the chair on the spots he goes for most and left them on for 7-10 days. Most of the time when he tried to scratch he hit one of the sticky pads, gets annoyed and stops. I took the sticky pads off because I cant sit on the chair with them on and they're very visible, he hasnt started scratching again. I think I may need to periodically reapply these for a week or so so that he doesnt catch on to that the chair isnt sticky anymore, but so far they've worked well. The claw caps are great, the spray can helped a lot, and these finished the job."
2,Sticky Paws,"Doesn't really stick to furniture and it stands out because it is white. I wouldn't order it again. My kitties just ignore it and find another area to scratch,"
1,Cat not fooled,"I adopted an adult cat. She seemed to already know what this was and was tearing it off with her mouth faster than I could apply it. She was having none of it!If you want to give this a try, apply it while your cat is out of the room and keep in mind, there's an awful lot of surface area to a couch. You'll need a ton of it."
4,Sticky Paws Furniture Strips,I find that this product works well. They do fall off after a couple of months wear which is not a problem.My felines don't like Sticky Paws but I think they are wonderful!!
4,12 is better,"The 10 paddle shut the box is compact and easy to store, however the 12 paddle unit is much better and more fun to play. ... Dan"
3,Slightly Disappointed,The only thing I really did not like was the size of the game. I expected it to be alot bigger compared to others.
5,Love this toy!,Purchased for my 6 year old son. He loves math and this was a great game choice for him. It is very eduacational and teaches quick math skills! He used it almost every day. My husband and I use it almost every day also. It is nice looking as well and has a permanent home on our endtable. When people come over they grab it and play it. We love that it can be played by one person as well as many. It is a super quick game lasting about one minute or it can be played as a longer game between two or more people where points are established. Very versatile game. We have had this now for over a year and it looks as though it will last for many more years to come! Cannot say enough about it!
3,Dissappointed,"I guess I'm partly to blame for not reading the fine print, but I was very dissappointed when I received this item. The game is very small (physically). Can't hardly even set it on your lap. The dice are also very small. Another thing I'm dissappointed about is that it did not come in a box. So, the dice are very easy to lose. In fact, we've lost one die already. I've played the game before on a bigger box and it just seemed more enjoyable."
3,tom the uncle,"Its great game for adults Bar game, but it is also great for kids who are learning the make up of Numbers"
3,Broad But Not Deep,"This book is more of an introduction to ship modeling than a comprehensive volume. It might be appropriate as (one of) the first book(s) one reads on the subject, but is not sufficiently detailed to live up to its highly ambitious title. The chapter on gunnery fittings is the most detailed, but still can't impart the detail and volume of information available from other sources. The author communicates his palpable enthusiasm for the hobby. This, combined with the broad but somewhat thin material he offers, will stimulate readers to further and more detailed exploration of ship modeling. This book is a good choice as a gift for someone (early teen or older) who may be interested in the field."
5,Wonderful book on ship modeling!,"I bought this book for my husband, and it was exactly what he was looking for. It contains everything you need to know if you want to build model ships. Plus there is historical reference to the different types of models. Very happy with this book!"
5,Feel-Good-Silly music that will make you tap your feet!,"I have this and about 3 other albums from Trout...and I have no children. This music always puts a smile on my face and helps me deal with the ride home from work! This is definately a children's album, but if you can hand over your maturity, sing this at the top of your lungs....you will DEFINATELY have fun! Be careful...you might start humming ""Mine!"" while your walking down the halls at work!"
3,Seems to help some,My eye doctor recommended these eye drops for me. I could not find them in the stores so I ordered them. They are thick and will make your vision blurry for about a half hour. They don't have any perservatives in them so they won't irritate your eyes and you can use them as often as you like. I have very bad dry eyes and nothing else seems to work for me. I have used these for a week now and am hoping for the best.
2,Benefit of Whibal smallest size,"I found this item of little use for my needs. The problem really is that it takes one photo with the whibal before anything else. This adds one unit for any other number of photos. It's OK if you take quite a number of pictures in the same environment,but it's a waste if you're going to take only a few. What you get is one photo with whibal for three or so taken. However, I find that with my Canon EOS 30D, I would gain a lot more with the larger size (3.5 x 6) which would allow me to use the custon white balance. This is why I ordered a second card, this time, the right size. Unfortunately, I had to pay much more to grt what I needed."
2,Do not waste $$ on this.,A piece of white paper pretty much funcitons similarly to my WhilBal that cost $30. There is no extra value to use WhilBal for white balance.
4,Pretty good,"I can't give a definitive review of the WhiBal card but I think it has helped me get white balance right. It's especially necessary when you have a mixed light, e.g., daylight with flash.I wish that the sleeve would stay on when I've got it hung around my neck to help protect the card. I'll jerry-rig something but I shouldn't have to."
1,Not worth the price,Sure it is more convenient than the expo discs or discs that are over large and you have to screw on but the price is not worth it. Has the price of plastic gone up. Someone else mentioned using a piece white of paper. It does the job but you don't want someone to hold it everytime. I bought a certified grey card which does the same job as this one for half the price and with extras. I guess your paying for the name but that just me. In this economy I can save dollars without comprimising quality.
5,WhiBal good learning tool.,"I'm learning a great deal by using the Whibal card. It works pretty much as expected in uncomplicated lighting situations. But in more complex lighting situations I'm learning various ways I can (inadvertently) not follow instructions resulting in wacky white balance. Last week I was shooting pictures of our mountain house. It was a bright day and I shot from the shadows of the trees in front of the house. I held the WhiBal card in front of me, in the shade, to get my reference shot. When I balanced to the WhiBal in Lightroom a very bad green cast came over the picture. In his short, simple instructional videos ([...]) the creator (Michael Tapes)clearly states the importance of taking a reference shot in the light the subject will be shot in. I should have taken the reference shot in the sun. But that's what I like. I like how the card is increasing my understanding of lighting and photography."
4,A must have! Great but pricy...,"I think this item is a must have for serious digital photographers as it is essential for accurate white balance!I like it because it is easy/convenient to use and carry, reliable, small sized (fits in a pocket!) and light, ...However, I was disappointed when opening the package: I found it quite expensive considering it's only made of some sort of foam...Even the lanyard (provided) may look more expensive than the cards themselves!The instructions are not provided but are available online--the good thing is that they are pretty extensive, simple, and fun (videos!).Bottom line: A great and vital item that comes at a price!"
5,It's Great,1st class. does what is made to do very well. I have a professional Photographer friend who raves about it
3,Two things come to mind...,"... as I read this work. (1) It would profit from expository material that would round out or explain or just establish the context of the comments. Blumenson did this, for example, with the Patton Papers quite successfully. (2) I am staggered by Alanbrooke's self-confidence regarding strategic thought. I would think when everybody that he came in contact with professionally over a 4-5 year period (except for Dill) was (totally) inept that he would think ""Hmm... Maybe it's me..'. Sheer statistics would have at least a few people who were right occasionally, or who did well in their own area. It shifts from declamation to bragging after a while.It's an important work, and it is what it is: one's man emotional release in a tremendously stressful position. It does nothing, however, to improve his historical standing."
4,Sleepwalking to Sex,Interesting take on sleepwalking and subconscious 'suggestions'. Plot is a bit far fetched than most but still an entertaining read.
4,Always Rubinstein,"A little fast for me. I prefer Martha Argerich's version. In every case, a good performance. Also good remastered. xxxx"
1,Noisy Source material overwhelms.,"The folks at RCA put this on the market despite many technical flaws. Perhaps the original source material from the 40s had lots of back ground noise (record hiss and pop and crackle) so I should not be surprised, however the back ground noise on this CD is really distracting. I have some RCA LPs having the same performer and music and they play better than this CD.Don't spend the money. RCA probably wanted to bring these Rubinstein recordings out to add to their Rubinstein ouvre. ButI felt ripped off by paying so much money for a truly inferior recording (Not the fault of the perfromer)."
3,"Waiting for the next ""Startide""","Startide Rising is not only my favorite Brin book, but also one of my top 3 favorite SF books--period..I bought Otherness because the themes of the book seemed related in a way to Startide...Otherness turned out to be a generally good read, but only one story stood out as one I'd read a second time...""Shhh"". This snippett of a story seems worthy of a novel of its own...It raises the question...Are humans special at all or is it only our belief that we are unique that keeps us striving to grow? Some of the other short stories seem to -almost humorously- illustrate one man's (Brin's!)struggle to understand the ""otherness"" of women. Oh well, I give him credit for trying."
5,Stretch your mind,"Years after reading this collection, it stays with me. A treatise on natural selection, even to universes. I've read SF from all the eras. For provoking thought, this is the best."
3,B-Sides And Live Songs (from The Cranberries),"I want to buy this cd, please find it, and tell me the price."
1,Poor design,"I purchased this unit from Amazon. After using this on various cars and motorcycles, leads started to go intermittent on me. Only by jiggling them on the contact points on the tender would they make contact. Now only 2 of the 5 banks work. I took the unit apart and found that the nylon snap contacts for the leads are soldered directly to the master board with 2 delicate solder points. As the user connects and disconnects the leads, the nylon connectors snap together. Very flimsy way of making contact for a point that sees repeated usage. Absolutely no stress relief for the solder points. Poor design for reliability. It would cost a bunch to repair, then after use, would fail again. They should have placed a flexible intermediate lead to the disconnect points. Buy the individual units instead. This is NOT commercial quality by any stretch of the imagination."
3,Somewhat deceptive,"This book purports to give the inside story on all the number one Billboard hits for the past 40 years. Well, that's what I would like to have seen, and the reason I bought the book. Info like where did the idea for the song come from, what was the creative process for producing the song, what did it take to get it recorded, were there any speed bumps along the way, what was the special meaning of this or that famous line, etc. That would have been a great book. Unfortunately, despite the title, that isn't what you get with this book. Each page is devoted to one song, and for the majority of the entries in this book, the page allocates 1 or 2 paragraphs to the actual song, while the rest of the page is taken up in profiling the singer or band that sang the song, while the song itself takes a back seat. So, in the interest of fairness, this book should really be titled: The Billboard Book of The Singers Behind The Number One Hits."
5,Can't put it down,This is definitely a trip down memory lane for those of us with more than a few years under our belt. Bronson has done some great research to come up with stories and anecdotes of the artists that have found the ultimate success on the Billboard charts. I would highly recommend this for anyone that is a music buff and loves more information about the artists behind the songs. The pictures that accompany each page (one page per #1 song) are an added bonus!
4,Behind the Scenes,"Good book on the stories behind hits. I must admit that I have only read a handful of entries at this point, but it is the kind of book that I will periodically pick up over the years."
5,"More than a book on hits, but a testament on Amer. culture","This book, which is a fascinating read, is a must for music fans and historians, and is a testament to everchanging times in American popular culture. Mr. Bronson tells bright, vivid anecdotes about each song, and by flipping through the pages one literally sees history (or popular music's reflection thereof) pass right through one's fingers. A fascinating, engrossing book, whose significance will only grow as years go by. Can't wait to get my hands on the next edition!"
5,A book for every music lover,"Anyone who loves music or who has lived through any part of the last 50 years of rock and roll will love this book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. Every number one song from 1955 to today gets one page in this book, and every page is fascinating. Fred Bronson has interviewed the artists, the songwriters, and the producers of over 900 number one songs. Then he finds the most interesting things to tell us about these songs, with generous quotes from the people he has interviewed. The book starts with ""Rock Around the Clock"" and works its way through Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Motown, Carole King/James Taylor, disco, new wave, rap, and Clay Aiken (and so much more than I can describe here).A friend of mine told me to buy this book and I have been thanking her ever since. Now I'm giving them as gifts to all of my friends because I have enjoyed it so much."
4,"Kiss him, Kate","A flash (fire) from the past is the heart of the newest Kate Shugak murder mystery. As ever, Alaskan author Dana Stabenow expertly weaves the place and its politics into the tale. Kate goes South to Anchorage to investigate a 31 year cold case of arson/murder, angering one of Alaska's most powerful families. Longtime readers of this series will miss Kate's friends and family back in The Park (""twenty million acres, almost four times the size of Denali National Park but with less than one percent of the tourists,"") but this foray into the bright lights of the big city shows that you can take the girl out of The Park, but you can't take The Park out of the girl. The romance between Kate and State Trooper Jim Chopin heats up in this episode. It's a little too steamy for my blood. /TundaVision, Amazon Reviewer"
2,Disappointing,Kate Shugak has gone from the tough as nails woman we liked and admired to an urban tease. Her blatant admission of trying to drive Joe crazy with her sexual prowess is sluttish. That is not the Kate we knew and respected. She is now interchangable with dozens of other female main characters. Very disappointed.
4,Kate investigates wealthy family,"Kate Shugak is looking forward to settling into her newly- rebuilt cabin in the Alaskan wilderness when she is offered ajob in Anchorage. Charlotte Muravieff asks Kate to prove that her mother is in jail on false charges that she killed her son in a fire 30 years ago. Kate somewhat reluctantly takes the case and begins her investigation into the crime. In doing so, she tangles with one of the most influential families in Alaska. Soon, people close to the case begin to die and Kate knows that she is getting close to an answer. Her own life is also put in danger. Two subplots which are woven through the main plot involve her relationship with policeman Jim Chopin (written in a surprisingly heavy-handed fashion) and two young boys who seek refuge with Kate when things get too tough at home. All in all, this book will probably please Stabenow's many fans."
5,"Awesome Book, Awesome Series",My reviews of these books are a bit repetitive.This is my current favorite series and as such I find every book I read to be awesome.I've read them all this year and keep anxiously awaiting each new book.
5,Ok this one was interesting.,What's the matter with people who left messages about this isn't about tainted blood. Really people this is a novel and it's name is such but it's a fiction novel base mystery category....so stop leaving negative reviews because it's not a horror story or some nonsensical fetish you are looking to read about. The description pretty much tells you what this novel's story line is if you'd taken the time to read that. Meantime this mystery is right at the top of the Kate Shugak best. Makes you wonder who's hiding out in your family closet. Or worse what. A must read in the line of he series.
4,A Taint in the Blood,"Good, fast paced thriller. Kate takes on new cases as she now a responsible parent. We see Her character evolve as she matures, yet she is still the strong Shugak we love"
1,What happened?? Did someone else write this?,"I have read all the previous Kate Shugak books and for the first time I am disappointed. The first 13 books were good reads, the main character likeabe, and the plots intriguing.Unfortunately, this book is really obnoxious. So is the main character, Kate, who has become an egotistical bigot. The changes in the main character Kate's personality are forced and stilted, and have turned her into a holier-than-thou, conceited, swollen-headed bimbo.This was a terrible progression in her character development. I will try one more book after this, but if this garbage continues I'm done."
3,I didn't know I had bought a Harlequin Romance.,If I had know that this would read like a Harlequin Romance novel then I wouldn't have bought it.Too much bosom heaving and fluid draining for me.I can understand that Stabenow wants her readers to know that Kate is moving on but TMI on the sex with Chopin.Mutt as always is the best character.
3,Little bands want te become as big as.......................,"When I bought this CD I was more interested in the covers than in their own songs. The Cd contains songs from various bands, who were allowed to promote their own Cd by covering a Metallica song. I have to say: They did it pretty good. Especially Trapped under Ice, Master of Puppets and The Four Horsemen are covered very well. But not only the covered songs are good, their own songs are also worth listening. My favorite is The Eye of the Observer. Concluding: It's not the best Cd on this world, but it's nice when you have it and you will not regret it.Chielant de Wit."
5,Cosmos - Carl Sagan's groundbreaking miniseries,"If you weren't around when this miniseries was first broadcast, you missed a genuinely pivotal point in TV history. Even today, with TLC and Discovery and such broacasting their space-related series, this is the one that changed the way viewers looked at science, felt about space, visualized themselves and their relationship with the universe. This is the one that set the standard that the others still aspire to. You can find the CD version that has a few updates to more recent scientific findings, but to tell the truth there's little that needs updating. Sagan got it right the first time. And the VHS version has the book, too. I highly recommend this set."
3,Spendy,"Lot of money. There is not much difference betwee GSI and Coleman. Coleman is much less money. Also, the coffee pot does not come with a coffee basket. All is made in MX."
1,Pots don't heat up!,"The plates and bowls are fine. The cups are OK but the rounded lip leads to slurping or dripping. The real kicker is the coookware. The pieces I have are great heat insulators ..... that is, they resist heat! It takes FOREVER to heat up items in the pot or frying pan or coffee pot. I used blue enamel cookware from Mexico 25 years ago and it was excellent. Because of that I assumed this would be the same. But NO. In the baking enamel process they have managed to make cookware which does not heat. Throw it out or be warned that it will waste enormous amount of time and energy. I am certain that the old blue enamel cookware is still made in Mexico and is still excellent ..... but this stuff is not it! Too bad."
2,Permanent Green Light - a stepping stone for Michael Quercio,"After Michael Quercio's band the Three O'Clock lost their musical focus and faded into obscurity, he formed Permanent Green Light to return to his tougher, guitar-based psychedelic rock roots. This self-titled ep has a few songs that fans of his style will find worthwhile, but this isn't his best work. Permanent Green Light did, however, allow Quercio to flex his creative muscles a bit again and get back into the 60's rock sound of which he's always been intensely fond; this ultimately led to the terrific debut cd by his current group, the Jupiter Affect (their album ""On The Two Ways of Becoming Alice"" is his best work since the Three O'Clock's ""Arrive Without Travelling""). This ep is fine for hardcore fans, but certainly not his best effort to date."
3,My opinion,"I am disappointed with this book.I have already included it in my ""BOOKS FOR SALE"" list.I am disappointed because(1) Not enough details;(2) Not enough examples."
3,My opinions,"I am quite disappointed with this book.I have already included it in my ""BOOKS FOR SALE"" list.Although it covered many many topics , but it doesn't provide enough details on each topic. There are not enough examples, too.I really have doubt on the authors' knowledge."
1,Pffffffft!,"This book reaks. It's about half full with almost true-to-life generalizations. The other half is weighted down with overly detailed jargon intelligible only to working systems analysts. If you're a student, don't sign up for any class using this text. You'd be better off spending a couple of days with a real analyst (cheaper and faster, too). Other than that, it makes a great hundred dollar paper weight. Save your money!"
1,Where's the beef?,"I was disappointed in this textbook. It is a watered down textbook. It appears to be written by someone that hasn't actually ""done"" systems analysis and design."
2,Only good to fall asleep to,"I agree with some of the other negative reviews of this album about it sounding way too tinny. I am a big fan of lo-fi music, but this is no-fi music. The louder I turned it up, the worse it sounded. I have given it several listens, but have found nothing redeeming about it, other than it is so mellow and droning(in a bad way) that its easy to fall asleep too. There is much, much better music from this genre.... I don't want anyone to make the same mistake that I did."
4,"i wrote a poem on a dog biscut, but your dog refused 2 look","at it. And so begins ""4th of July"", probably one of my favorite Galaxie 500 lines ever, next to ""I stayed @ home on the 4th of july, and i pulled the shades so i didn't have to see the sky, and i decided to have a bed in , but i forgot to invite anybody""Only Dean Wareham's fractured genius can paint a picture of isolation and self-doubt in this way, and his detached storytelling verses remind me of ""The Gift"" in a sillier setting. ""Sorry"" has this cool dreamy haze going on, as does ""melt away"", and ""king of spain pt. 2"" with its delicate percussion and waves of guitar gently drifts along. Find your own classics, own this lp. I can't speak for the reissue because I have the rough trade orig."
3,It's their Let It Be...,"Meaning writing songs and performing had become perfunctory for the band at this point as they were beginning to unravel and test each others' patience. There are a few gems on here: Fourth of July; Listen, the Snow is Falling and Melt Away are my favorites. Other individual songs have decent glimpses, but can seem underdeveloped or self-conscious in delivery.As a whole, this one doesn't have the spark the prior two releases did."
1,Disappointing,"When I first started using this hole punch, was a little disappointed to learn that it doesn't 'lock' very well--i.e., you regularly have to make sure it is properly set to standard 3 hole punch. The slider that holds the paper in proper position moves to easily. After only using infrequently for a couple of months, one of the springs has started sticking and the papers get stuck after being punched. I then have to stick scissors in to release the spring. Would NOT recommend this product."
2,WARNING - DVD-R,I liked the movie and would give it four stars if not for Amazon's misrepresenting a DVD-R as a DVD. They are doing this more and more and it is a bad trend.Please contact Amazon and complain.
3,Just OK,"I thought the book was more about cool travel destinations but it was more about weather flying, additional ratings etc. Ok read, I wanted to rush through it to read a new book I bought ""Say Again, Please"" which is an excellent book on comms."
4,Take it to the next level!!!!!,"You would think that after you got your license you would not have any problem finding stuff to do. Well, not so easy. This book covers everything from grass fields, prepping your family for flight in small aircraft, basic engine care, it is all here. This is a good book for the newly licensed"
1,Don't judge by its cover.,"Misleading title, preying on us souls grappling with that question! By the time you have your license, you already know most if not all of this stuff. I might recommend it to someone who has not begun training yet. Change the title to ""So You Want To Be A Private Pilot?"" and I'll give it more stars."
4,Well written history of rocket science and the Space Race,This is a well written book about rocketry and the space race up to the first lunar landing. It has exceptional photographs of the people and rockets.I just read it again while awaiting the Space Shuttle flyover prior to tomorrow's landing.
1,Waste of your time and money,"This product is cheap, ugly, and does not include any way to power it. The metal edges are start and if you are not carful you will cut yourself its just boxy and jagged everywhere not very streamlined or anything. There was no cable to plug this into an outlet so you would have to buy one and some how attach it. Really just disappointing."
4,Bit off more than I can chew.,"Well, I hate to say it, but this book is just a lot more information and in depth than I'm prepared to digest right now. Perhaps my mistake was not reading the first volume first. I've never considered myself short on attention span, but I've had to skip to the chapters that speak directly to what I want to know. I'm still slowly working my way through parts of it. I would say this book is for serious scholars only. I thought I was one, but apparently I'm not."
4,Jesus and the Victory of God,"A most detailed and excellent work, probably too technical or detailed for the ordinary reader but required reading for anyone studying the life and ministry of Jesus."
1,Not For True Horse Lovers,"Nice enough for the third grade girl going through a ""horses are cool"" phase, but not exactly realistic. First of all, the illustrations are really screwed up. The horse looks like a stuffed animal. And also, since when do people ride full show regalia hours before the show? Wouldn't their breeches and jackets get dirty? I share the sentiments of another reviewer, too: dressage is not at all unatural; quite the contrary, actually. it is one of the most natural forms of riding. And the author says western saddles have things to ""hold onto"". Does she mean the horn? Because that really isn't a handle. And eventing isn't just called eventing at Olympic level! I could go on and on about this parody of dressage and overall horsemanship, but I have better things to do with my time. Go ahead, buy it if you don't care about petty mistakes, but be warned: this book has some issues with truth."
4,It was all right!,"For those of you who hate Stalin's guts, this is the biography for you! For those of you that sympathise with Stalin, it has potentual but not quite there! For those of you who want to see Stalin take Hitler down, well that's another story.Its a good biography, but some of it was information back from 2003 or 2004, so some of it might be outdated or might be useless. Either way its good, I mean for me it was ok. But I kind of wish they would have talked more about his personal life and his second wife's mental unstableness. But whatever!Just enjoy!"
4,Buy this album for charity and the Alan Jackson cut,"If you want an upbeat Christmas album for that holiday party your throwing, this might not be it. This is a great album for those relaxing nights next to the fire with those you love. Willie Nelson, Ricky Skaggs, and Patty Loveless highlight this album. If anything, buy the album for Alan Jackson's cut of ""Just Put a Ribbon in Your Hair."" A version that is so good, could ultimately become a Christmas classic. A true gem. Radio! Play this song!!!"
1,Just another twanging country-western Christmas album,"I'm a big fan of Willie Nelson, Norah Jones, Sam Bush, Allison Krauss, Pat Green, etc. But ""A Very Special Acoustic Christmas"" this is not. Not ""Very Special"" and not ""Acoustic."" I love these artists, but this collection mostly lacks evidence of their originality and creativity. The best composition on it is Jones' ""Peace,"" and Bush's ""Let it Snow"" has some creative mandolin, as one would hope and expect. But the rest of the songs sound like what you'd hear on any random AM country station driving around the prairie. If that's your thing, you'd probably love this CD. But the title of this album should be ""Tired Old Country-Western Christmas."""
3,Not what expected,"I like my CHristmas music pretty ""christmasy"" e.g. not outside the usual sounds. I appreciate what the creators of this series are doing but using secular rock stars doesn't work for me. I saved a few songs then gave it away."
1,Just donate your money directly to the Special Olympics,"This CD features the worst versions I've ever heard of any of these songs. Only buy it if you're a fan of ultra-twangy country music, to the point where you even want your Christmas music to be indistinguishable from anything else by the featured artists. Don't buy this expecting it to fill you with holiday cheer. Please just send a check to the Special Olympics instead."
2,Okay if you like slow music,"I guess this isn't what I was expecting - this is mostly the serious side of Christmas, not really any upbeat fun country stuff."
1,I thought they were new....,"The covers were shop worn and some of the pages were bent, worn and creased where people had flipped through the pages...they were supposed to be gifts....completely unaacceptable - had to buy substitutes."
2,Cool designs; incomprehensible instructions,"Very disappointing; was excited to try the many different original designs. However written instructions and diagrams are not clear at all, by far the weakest of the three books we got. My guess is that it is only for very experienced makers; not recommended for those without much familiarity with the principles of paper airplane construction (i.e. kids and their unsuspecting parents)."
5,Tons of fun! Great book for a rainy day.,"This is probably one of the greatest books I ever got as a gift growing up as a child. There are 40 different airplane instructions and 10 toy instructions. The airplanes truly are the highlight of this book. There are so many great airplanes and anyone (child or adult) could spend hours folding different airplanes and flying them through the air!My personal favorite is the ""Long Distance Champ."" This airplane flies forever (supposedly up to 150 feet! Although none of mine have flown that far - of course my living room is only about 30 feet wide). I also enjoy ""The Hunter,"" ""The Origami-Nose Box Plane,"" and ""The Ram Jet.""If you take care of kids I totally reccommend getting this book because it really is a great thing to pull out on a rainy day. The best thing about this book is every design only needs a normal sheet of white typing paper. You don't have to cut out pre-colored designs like many other airplane books."
1,Not Recommended,"This book has the most horrible directions and diagrams immagineable! There is no glossary of terms the author uses in his instructions (what in the world is an ""accordian fold"" and how does one ""accordian-fold the bottom sides""? What is a ""bottom side""?) and the diagrams are poorly labelled. Children and their parents will end up with nothing but frustration."
2,"Saccharine, but has some good tips for young children","""A Book of Friends"" is a picture book with text enumerating the many different kinds of friends one can have (pen pals, best friends, imaginary friends, family, and so on). Younger children will probably enjoy the illustrations, and there are ""Hints on how to be a good friend"" that could be very useful to children who are learning the basics of interaction in groups. Children who are beginning to read will find the semi-script typeface frustratingly illegible. I ordered this book for my first grader, but it's going to his kindergarten teacher."
2,Zipper faulty after second use,Not worth the money because the zipper is crap. Too lazy to return so I have a bag I keep my winter gear in my car and do not need the zipper. Oh well
2,TD;DR,The book is too long for any M3 to try to go through on their surgery rotation. I would suggest NMS Casefiles for surgery instead.
2,Not my cup of tea,"I'm not sure why I bought this book - perhaps I thought it would be something like Diane Mott Davidson's mysteries with recipes. It's not. One author refers to the woman who gave him the recipe for his farvorite cookies as having ""all the charm of a terra cotta wombat"". He was probably trying to be funny, but if the anecdote is true, I sincerely hope that lady never sees this book. She would be terribly hurt.The recipes may be very good. I haven't tried them. I was turned off by the anecdote above.I'm not recommending this one."
4,Very good book on Sport Flying,This is a really good basic overview of the new Light Sport category of airplanes. The book covered most aspects of how to become a proficient pilot with additional references. It was worth the price and time time spent reading.
4,Excellent - but with a flaw.,"Normally I would give this book 5 stars. What stopped me from doing so, is Mr Bergstroem's foreword. A book like this should be free from political polemic. I can sense his communistic leanings by the way he described Hermann Graf's ""repentance"" after the war. By writing...(he) had the strenght of seeing through what he had done... Mr Bergstroem does an unjustice to thousands of pilots who flew and died in defence of their home country. His foreword sounds very naive. I just like to know what he would have done under the same circumstances - would he have found out what courage is? Hopefully he can refrain from politics in his next book. It only detracted from an otherwise excellent piece of literature on the Luftwaffe."
5,Essential guide for Maya lands -,"Classic, essential, practical. Don't leave home for Maya lands without it."
4,Current Reference Work,I read this pretty quickly. There's no problem with knowing what the author is trying to say. I found the representation to be a little full of sad satire and sorry history lessens but then again the reality really has been horrific.I will hang on to this and use it as a reference. I always find it interesting the way several 1st person accounts of a like place will produce inconsistencies in attitudes and reactions.
1,Wriiten by dummies not for dummies,"I found this book exteremly hard to get into. I kept looking for a part of the book where I would find some good examples to follow to get me started. The person that wrote this book made a study of the menus and interface but I don't believe they ever made practical use of the product. They need to get someone that actually understands the software and the field of graphics to write the book.I'm sorry to say, but I think they need to go back to the drawing boards with this book. What a waste of money."
4,Paint Shop Pro Appreciation,"We have to rely on outside books because the manufacturers no longer provide comrehensive manuals for their products. Paint Shop Pro 7 for Dummies is a very well done, mostly complete user's manual. You will find the answer to most of your questions in it."
1,Late and Fake,"Very Late, Ordered as a anniversary present for my wife 9 days prior to our anniversary and it didn't arrive until 3 weeks after our anniversary. Ring doesn't have much shine and looks fake. The ruby is much larger than it appears in the picture, the two CZs on the sides of it are cloudy and do not shine, and the smaller CZs all around have no glisten and make the metal look like plastic."
4,Does the job.,"I would rather have the brush that comes with a suction cup to stand it upright- but this brush does alright. It works well for wide-mouthed bottles. The uncoated metal parts rust fairly quickly, so I would recommend replacing it more often then the manufacturers recommend."
1,Piece of crap.,"This piece of crap ain't worth a dime, let alone 13 bucks. The mirror I received had a dent in it, making everything appear warped. It was packed in a box that you just know has been sitting on a shelf in some warehouse for years. The craftsmanship (and that's being bold using THAT word here...) is shoddy. You can practically smell the tears of the slave laborer that pieced this POS together before being given his bowl of gruel.Do yourself a favor and just get a nice ""monitor"" mirror next time. FAIL."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is a cheap product. It does what it says it does, but you can tell it's not made of the best materials. The clock is still working but the mirror (not glass... reflective plastic) keeps falling out. I guess the adhesive they used isn't strong enough. It's happened four times so far in as many months. Weird, it's really not hanging on much of an incline. Ehh, the title of this review tells you everything you need to know about this product."
3,Not disappointed - but not totally satisfied.,"It is a cheap mirror and when you look into it you get that ""fun house"" effect. No instructions for setting the clock and I figured I'd have to go back to school to get my rocket science degree before I could figure it out. Luckily someone in my office played with it for 10 minutes and got the time set. I hung it up in my cube and it works fine. Not sure I would have paid the amazon price for it if I would have picked it up at a store and saw the quality. Not disappointed enough to send it back."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book recently, looking for greater insight into my Midheaven. I was happy to find the text, as there are not many books on this subject in print. But I didn't get the insight I was looking for. Clement discusses the Midheaven from more of a spiritual aspect, which left the astrological aspect lacking. I closed the book still feeling hunger for the knowledge I sought. If there's a better book on Midheavens out there, I don't know about it, but I'm definitely looking for it."
2,Heavy on Psychobabble,"The introduction and first two chapters of this book is nothing but annoying, meaningless psychobabble. I say this as someone with a master's degree in clinical psychology. The astrological knowledge about the mid-heaven to be gained by reading these pages of the book could be summed up in a paragraph or two and certainly doesn't need the distracting ""in-depth"" psychological treatment. Fortunately, the chapters dealing with each sign are much better, but still don't offer any new information that can't be found in dozens of other, better books."
1,a winner... sort of,"most overpriced one touch strips @ $1.25 per strip!One Touch Ultra Mail Order Test Strips, 50 CT"
1,disappointed,"I searched for details about the ""clipboards"" advertised. The photo shows 4, all in the colors I needed, the title says clipboards...however I received 1 clipboard not the 4 pictured and no details to tell if it is one, two, three, or four clipboards.The title should read as Clipboard...not clipboards. There was no way to know it was only one clipboard...maybe even an option to choose a color would have helped. I am very disappointed with this order."
5,It so good when you find a new author,"I'm a big fan of thrillers. Some of my favorite authors are Ken Follett, Robert Ludlum, Michael Connelly, and Vince Flynn. I am now adding Bruce Schwartz to that list. What an easy book to read. It's so much about what is happening in the world today that it takes your breath away. The author keeps you guessing with his twists and turns, and every character's plight is interesting. It was like I was watching a movie in my head. Everyone is right about this book. It was absolutely the best!"
3,"Fair, but not all that informative","Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I thought that this book would include numerous day trading patterns. The main advice given is to buy the breakout after the price has been steady for a period. The book does have a lot of good charts showing setups to stay away from, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but I didn't think that it was worth the price."
5,6 STARS,"I've bought many books on investing and daytrading, and this book, along w/ the advanced volume, are by far on top of the list. Barry gets right to the point, no B.S. here. The books are loaded w/ actual charts so you can see (not just read) how the actual setups unfold.Get this.....I emailed Barry w/ a question, and he called me a couple of days later, spending more than 10 minutes w/ me on the phone. (After the market was closed of course! ) How many authors do you know that would've done that!"
2,Not very impressed,"Although the book does contains some useful information, it could have easily been sold as a daytraders handbook of some kind for much less. 1/2 of the book is illustrations (overkill in my opinion). Later parts of the book simply repeat information presented in earlier parts of the book.This could have easily been a 75 page handbook for [less money]. In my opinion, the [book is] severly overpriced. Because of this, I give a 2 star rating."
1,It could be better,"This book is an excellent one as a rich TA material you can count on, but the layout and chapter display is very poor especially the handwriting in the charts..! I didn't expect that in expensive book...!"
5,7 Stars - These are Required Reading,"Both of Barry Rudd's books are specific and advanced, the ""genuine pro trading stuff"" that's so hard to find among all the fluff out there. Along with Tony Oz' Stock Trading Wizard, Murphy's TA and Nison's Candlestick books, Barry Rudd's two Stock Patterns for Day Trading books are essential reading, and we recommend them highly at www.Daytrading-University.com for all our traders.I am a tough critic, it is difficult to find practical and useful day trading books out there, too much theory and basics in most of them. Rudd's books are the only ones I've found that are packed with high-probability advanced intraday chart patterns (not simple flags and pennants) annotated with traders' notes explaining the trade mechanics.Rudd's books are in the top 5 of all day trading books I've read (I've read over 30 daytrading books so far). These books are terrific, and I feel comfortable recommending them without hesitation."
1,Does not mount!!,I bought this when I bought my mini. It worked fine for the first year....Now it does not mount...I have so many important files I wish I would have backed up with another source.I do not recommend!
4,Good,"I would rate it higher, but it's so difficult to put together. Another complaint I have is that there's a big gap between the two doors on the bottom and you can't adjust to minimize the gap. Otherwise it's great, sturdy as I use it for my heavy microwave."
3,Some good points...,This book was helpful in understanding co-dependency and such. I'd b hesitant in recomending the book as there's more phycology than christian thought here and there should b a balance. The good points were fasenating while other parts of this book really draged on.
1,"Great, if you like birds","This is great if you want to wake up to bird calls every morning, otherwise just go by a normal alarm clock!"
3,Great introductory book,"I took a chance on the book when I saw it in a discount bin, and glad I did. The major fault I find with the book is that it never gives more than a paragraph or two of attention to any of the individual animals. It does cover a wide variety of animals, and tells more about the hardships the group had to undergo instead of the individual acts of heroism. My recommendation is to pick up the book (the authors percentage of this book goes to a statue fund for war animals) and use the information found in it to do more research on the subject on the net or through other books..., some of which are mentioned as great references within this book."
3,strathwood copper finish hose pot,"Wish it was heavier,Like the look of the finish,A tad small, 100' spills overPull out the rubber feet so it can drain rainwater"
5,Hose pot,"Very nice copper finish. Good size, large enough for reasonable length hose but not too big for hiding in landscaping. Has withstood outdoor environment all summer without loosing finish. Drain holes in bottom. Light weight but still sturdy."
5,Nice!,"This hose holder is just as easy to use as the other ones on the market, but it actually looks nice! Most people don't even know it is a hose pot until they go over and look inside."
1,Yuck!,No drain holes meant having to dump standing water out of the thing on a regular basis and led to copper smears all over the hose which ended up all over me everytime I went to use the hose. After one year I heaved mine into the garbage--disgusting hose and all--yesterday. An environmental and financial nightmare all the way around--I'm looking for something made of composite with drain holes and a lid this time--that will hopefully last longer.
3,Happy So Far!,"Well, I only used the hose pot a couple of times so far. I purchased it late in the season. It looks pretty and for the price was a good deal. Water does seem to sit in it so I think I will drill some holes for drainage. You still have to coil a hose into it so it's not easy like a reel but it is more for looks which is what I wanted."
2,finish did not hold up,"This item was beautiful when I got it. It's been out of the box for about a month, and in that time, the finish has completely deteriorated. it is covered with rust and no longer looks like copper at all. I live on the northern Oregon coast, and the atmosphere is pretty corrosive, but I did think the coating would keep the metal protected for longer than a month. Evidently, the glaze was damaged. As a hose pot, it works, but it's not pretty any more."
2,Not shiny copper,"The hose pot works for the hose, but the finish is very different from the photo. I probably wouldn't have bought it if I'd known what it really looks like."
4,Beautiful watch but minor problems,"I got this watch as a Christmas present. It looks great and I get a lot of complements. The watchband is not great after only two months i had to replace it because the pink was wearing off (I contacted Sturhling and they shipped me out a new one for free). You also have to wind the watch or else it stops eveyone in a while, but if you do that every couple days it works perfect. All in all a great watch I would by it again."
2,"Nice Fun Watch but the ""Leather Strap""????","I was very happy and excited when I received this watch last 3/26/08. I love it that I started wearing them since then. Unfortunately the so called ""leather strap"" started to peel off. If I can notice the damage done in a couple of days of use, I wander how it would look like in a month. I'm very disappointed. I'm sending it back."
1,I guess anyone can get a record nowadays,"Are you kidding me? I check the Billboard Hot 100 list to see if there are any songs I've missed in the past couple of weeks, and Ashlee Simpson has some song I've never heard of climbing the charts. So....straight to iTunes and look up Ashlee Simpson. Up pops this idiot who has a whole album named after her. I figure it's some comedy riff about Ashlee and her lack of talent, but no, just some douche repeating her name for two minutes. Turns out he's done plenty of these songs. Who's buying this crap? The 30 second sampler was enough time for me to go get my gun and threaten to kill myself. Thank God I only got the 30 second sampler. What a joke."
1,what an idiot,i cant believe this guy is allowed in the music world all he ever does is says the names of celebrities like ashton kutcher he doesnt know a thing about music hes just an idiot who unfortunately is allowed to perform what kind of person releasescds when he only says condelezza rice for two minutes
3,Great workout but requires tons of pausing and rewinding,"I stopped the video to come review this - it definitely gets you sweating, but you literally have to watch every move, then stop and rewind, cause if you try to do it as quickly as she moves between moves, you'll probably stumble and fall. You have to be SUPER coordinated to do these videos and I'm about average - I can keep up sometimes but most of the time I'm pausing, rewinding, etc. It gets really annoying for me to keep stopping my workout to study where her feet are, what she's doing with her handsetc.Also be aware that the ""Elite 11"" moves that she teaches you in the Learn & Burn are used a little in the other videos, but it's mostly variations of them which will make you feel pretty awkward. Just warning you all. I would watch one of the YouTube videos that actually shows you how fast she transitions from one move to another and THEN make the decision to buy."
4,Great workout but package was missing disc one of the set.,"I love the Turbo Jam workouts and have had great success with them, however when I ordered the full set I received everything but disc one of the dvd set. The package was faulty. If you purchase this item make sure you have everything that is promised to you! :)"
2,Damaged,"I just got my Turbo Jam and when I opened the box, the plastic bag that everything comes in was already opened. I thought it was weird but was willing to look past it since the dvd was still in the plastic wrap. I just did it this morning and midway through the workout the dvd skipped because it was damaged. So beware, this came directly from Beach Body and not a resell so not sure why the quality was bad."
2,The only weight I lost was in my wallet.,"Tired of looking at my gut and troubled by arthrtis, I thought I'd try this workout. The music is just okay, the instructor is good. The excercises aggravated my back and knees. If you have AO beware! Even with modifications it's too much of a strain for me. After a month of following the diet and workout plan, I was disgusted to only lose 1.5 pounds. Shopping in walmart I saw a Taebo Celebrity workout for 9 bucks and change. After five workouts with the Taebo I've lost 4.5 pounds. AND I'm still eating dessert everyday. This workout is not at all taxing on my joints. Ya live and learn."
3,DON'T BE A FOOL!!!!,"I've always been a fitness and enjoyed working out, but there's no way would I pay $119.99 for this dvd. OUTRAGEOUS PRICE!!! Yes, every seller wants to make a buck but this....insane and I won't apologize for saying so.Absolutely, if you need TURBO JAM'S motivation to get you moving, do yourself a favor and use the net to your advantage. Look elsewhere for TJ's DVD for far less money."
1,Ouch!,"I very much wanted to love this DVD set...but every time I tried to workout with Turbo Jam, I had to stop less than 10 minutes in because my back hurt so badly. There's too much twisting and gyrating for this to a safe workout for your back. Be warned all consumers with back pain, or a weak back, this is NOT a good work out for you. Try something more like pilates or yoga.I will admit that it would have been a good cardio workout if it hadn't been so damaging."
2,ok.. but hard to follow,I have really tried to get into this product.. but they move way to fast to keep up.. and next thing i know i am lost. and the weird positions they put you in. i could never seem to get right. even their learn the moves DVD moved you so fast.. they would have you do one move then next thing you know they were doing something else without telling you. would be great for someone that is a bit more experienced but for beginners like me buy at your own risk..
4,Feel the burn and SWEAT,"Very fun, upbeat, heart pumping workout. A great workout mixed with kickboxing, dancing, and karate all in one. works your entire body. Great workout with or without the gloves. I can tell a difference already I have been using for only a week but i have used it for 6days with a day break. It doesnt even feel like your excersing. You get plenty of diffrent excerise options so you dont get bored. I highly recommend."
1,Turbo,"Turbo Jam Kit sales for $60 new, on Beachbody.com.web-sit..why are these more than the company would sale them for,even used sales for more. to me the savings is to buy each Seporate"
1,Don't Pay $149! What is wrong with you!,Why is Amazon.com selling the same thing the actual company is selling for $72.95 on their website!! RIP OFF ALERT!!! And yes they are the exact same products in the package! Go to Turbo Jam's website and buy it!
2,Not so sure...,"I have to be honest... I just can't get into this. I have been working on losing weight through my diet first and foremost. I am down 10.4 lbs. I wish that this would get me motivated to exercise more. I realize that it is not going to do it all, but to be honest I have never been sore or ""felt"" anything on my body after doing the exercises. I think at the beginning my body should have felt something and if anything I was energized yes but do not think it is really targeting like it says it does. Who knows maybe I am going about it the wrong way or not doing it the way I should but I definitely don't think it was worth almost $75!"
1,Unoriginal! Taebo Copycat. Don't buy!,"Turbo jam should be sued for a taebo copyright violation. Chalene provides no proper instruction. If you want to dance, go to a party. Don't waste your time sending money to Chalene. You will likely hurt your body more than help it. Don't buy. Try tae bo instead. Billy Blanks is the real professional here. He will let you know how to kick, punch, position yourself, warm up and cool down properly. Please, be careful with your joints, muscles, etc. and use a real professional's properly instructed workout instead of Chalene's ditzy approach."
2,Not happy with price i paid for it,"I purchased this item for $100. When it came in the mail, there was a bill of sale inside the box. The bill of sale was from another company and showed a price of $49. (1/2 the cost of what I paid). Not sure why the mark up is double the original price. no one will answer that question."
2,I personally didn't like it,"I purchased it thinking great up-beat music with a good work-out. You can barely hear the music, even if you do use the feature where the music comes out louder. It's just not what I expected.Not my kind of workout would rather use my Firm tapes.Used it three times (bores me) You do work up a sweat, but I don't know it's just not my kind of workout.I will stick to the elliptical/treadmill/weights even stepper, but not this."
1,turbo jam maximum results,this system might be great but i bought through a used dealer and all they sent was one book for $59.06. Where is dvds and other material? I'm so disappointed!!!!!!
4,Pretty good,"I got this item a few weeks ago and have been using it for two weeks now. While I can't say I have seen ""rapid results"" I have noticed that my body is getting a bit more toned. As well as I have more stamina and endurance something that I had problems obtaining by running alone. I'll be honest I don't like to exercise but I don't like being out of shape either. These DVD's keep me interested enough to keep going and the amount of sweating I do is unbelievable, I have never been that soaked before. I like some workouts more than others cardio party I just can't seem to get into at all for some reason, but that's just me. I put on some techno and eurodance music and I'm ready to go.The moves are a bit fast paced for someone just starting but for someone looking to get a bit more toned or has a bit a of exercise experience, this might be for you."
2,Great Product until the handle broke,"Seems like everything I buy from pampered chef is a great concept, but made of totally cheap materials. This is the 3rd item that has broke on me that was a pampered chef item. It's made of weak plastic, and after a year + of use, the handle is cracked in half.Tried to go online to return the item, but pampered chef does not allow you to return anything without the receipt order number. WHO KEEPS A RECEIPT FOR OVER A YEAR??? Find another cheese grater, maybe at a reputable place like Williams Sonoma."
1,"broke upon use, dont buy","would have been nice if it would have worked, antenna wire came appart duing install, time expired so i could not return"
4,Yay!,This product is almost tasteless. I like to add it to applesauce and other foods to get the protein I usually can't.
2,"No closeup photos, not useful for stitchers","This book has lots of photos of lovely embroideries, but there are no closeups that show the details of how the stitching was done. Anybody who embroiders wants to see those closeups, so I have to give this book a ""not very useful"" rating from that perspective.However, if you are looking for some pictures of beautiful Chinese artwork, this book may be just your cup of tea."
5,Falco - extended Mixes,Tracklisting:A Rock Me Amadeus (Salieri Version) (8:21)B Urban Tropical (Extended Version) (7:25)
1,a butter knife is better,"I do a lot of cooking and catering, and these knives have been some of the worst cheese knives I've experienced. I bought the knives primarily for soft cheeses, and they did a horrible job. Spend the money and get a better set that you can really appreciate."
3,"great product, poor packaging","I bought these as gifts. The knives are great for cheese, but the presentation and packaging is very ugly."
5,Great Teaching Tool!,"The lessons in this book meet all my student's learning style needs. This book has many great ideas for independent and group work. The book has so many different ideas that I feel like it is a pleasure to teach spelling. Plus, the kids love it!"
1,Watch out-not fun disguised as fun!,"As an unschooler I found this book really annoying! It is just every day writing exercises dressed up as spelling. You do a fun project like a comic strip and put the emphasis on spelling. Or, let's make bumper stickers and see if you spelled the words right...Sorry folks, but this one spells boring."
2,"Some interesting info, but destined to be obsolete soon","This book shrugs off all shrill rhetoric and provides many resources for animal-free products and animal-friendly services. Where it falls short is in its reliance on pointing out particular companies and services rather than being prescriptive. While interest in green products is on the rise, its still a business model that has more risk than average. In short, there's a good chance that many of these companies will close up shop. A better approach would have been to spend more time on how consumers can evaluate products and services. What are the best-in-class standards PETA expects? A good first effort for tone, but I will wait for the next edition in hopes that it will have more than a list of references."
5,Inspiring and Practical,"Loved this book. I was skeptical at first, but it honestly dispelled some myths about living a vegan lifestyle. Easy to read and very helpful. I definitely recommend for readers from all perspectives."
1,Bait and Switch Hollywood Style,"A misleading title to a book that self destructs as you read it accompanied by a defective DVD means that there is not much I can recommend here. If you want to know more about how to make your video look like film, you can find better sources on the internet for free. The information this book provides that is directly related to the title could easily be put into a pamphlet. What this book really is is a simple introduction to digital video, and as such, it is about as good as any. The book was new yet the back crumbled and pages fell out in clumps as I read. To top it off, the DVD would not play on any computer or home player. I contacted the publisher and ask for a replacement to which they suggested I contact the seller. I decided against that. Judging from what I already know, I doubt I'm missing much."
3,"Good recipes, poor organization","Although there are some good recipes in this book (blueberry tart with walnut topping is one) I spent a lot of time flipping pages, trying to find information. I feel like the book could have been organized more effectively, which is unfortunate considering how much useful information it contains. Overall a good addition to the recipe library, but I often find myself using other references to supplement this book. Also, in a few cases I question the techniques or ingredients, for instance the use of baking powder in the food processor version of the ""flaky pie crust."""
5,Best pumpkin pie ever,The pumpkin pie in this book with the hazelnut crust is a lot of work but it is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made or eaten. My family requests it every year and sometimes out of season.
5,Fail Proof Pies and Tarts,"Any pie or tart you will make from this book is sure to turn out perfectly. Although most take a considerable amount of time to prepare, no improvements can ever be made to the end results. Especially wonderful to have on hand for special occasions."
2,Leg Warmers,"You get what you pay for with these, they kept me warmer (I wasn't using them as a fashion accessory), but they are nylon and run very easily. I guess they're cute, but very cheaply made. Good bargain, but won't hold up for very long with regular wear."
2,"Small book, not much details",Small book with not much details.I wish I should not have bought this book.
3,lipglide Blossom,"Received very fast, great service. Product was supposed to be new but appeared used. Seller offered refund or free shipping, very satisfied."
3,Walking,It is OK but I wish there longer time between it looping back. There is only a short time for each segment fbefor starting over. Other than that it is good to watch while you walk.
2,What kind of forest?,"I don't know where this was filmed but it looks nothing like a forest to me. The bird sounds don't seem real. The walk didn't resemble the cover, and it looked more like a walk in a park or something. It was boring, but maybe is you want to de-stress it would work well."
4,Love It!,"I absolutely love this video. I agree with the others that it would be nice if each section was a little longer. That said, I do find that after a while, I barely notice the change as I am pretty absorbed in the scenery in its entirety. Great for large screen televisions and an elliptical machine!"
5,addictive,Get to know your friends (and yourself) a little better...all while having a great time. This little book is addictive and FUN!!
5,This was a gift for my daughter.,It is a wonderful gift for graduation. Good coffee table book. My daughter also uses it with older kids while traveling. This book is a great way to open communications with teenage kids.
5,IF I had to recommend the Perfect books for any kind of Get-Together...,"The IF books are amazing. They're excellent icebreakers for all ages, great for spicing up holiday get-togethers with family, PERFECT for first dates or getting to know people, and wonderful resources for interviewing guests, celebrities, job applicants, etc!I HIGHLY recommend the entire series... Just make sure you keep the IF3 & IF4 books set aside for separate situations. IF3 is GREAT for getting laid... NOT Great for learning about your grandparents' habits in the bedroom... & IF4 is perfect for grandparents... NOT perfect for getting someone hot & horny... LOL. Trust me on this!"
3,Like it,"I like the book and the whole idea, but there are far too many repeats. But, I would buy it again it made us think of many of our own."
2,"""If"" I had known the true contents, I would not have bought this book","If I had known the true contents of this book, I would not have bought it. Some of the questions are a bit ""over the top"" and not worthy of any discussion. I purchased this book to be used for topic discussion. I would not ask some of the questions contained in this book."
5,"Great book, great transaction!","The book was in the exact condition described, it came in a timely manner, packaged safely, etc. This is a great book for a group or friends to use over dinner or a couple to use on a date! It provides great laughs and you can learn something you've never known about your friends and/or family!!"
5,"Good Ice-Breaker, and just plain Fun","Okay...like another reviewer stated, if you are looking for serious, thought provoking questions, get a different book. Perhaps philosophy.Not everyone will appreciate the questions, and some are just plain silly, but it's a lot of fun if your electric goes out, camping, or a party that's jut not taking off.I liked it!xoxMEF"
2,A few gems among the repeats and risque,"The concept is marvelous -- there are so many situations in life where some sparkling conversation starters would be most helpful. If... has some imaginative questions to get discussion flowing and I appreciate that. However, by the time I eliminate the endless variations on the same theme, the old, overused standbys (If you could have dinner with any one person in history...) and the many sexual topics(including desired lovers, simultaneous lovers, same gender lovers, who you'd like to see naked and more), I'm left with only a few questions I will actually use."
3,If...,"The questions in this book are alright, but I have looked at other books since that offer better questions. Unfortunately I found them after I bought this book."
3,Not the 'original' I was looking for,"The first time I read this book was in a surgeon's office. It was a small square book but very thick(about 150 pages or more). It had many different categories. I was looking for that one in particular so when the description said it was the 'original' I thought it might be that one. Sadly it was the same one I already had which has few pages and categories. My daughter took it with her to college. I will continue to look for the classic (original) version.I love the If... book series though and have given them as gifts. Great conversation starters. My teenage kids and I have sat in our hot tub for hours with each of us reading from one of them. Good way to get to know each other even better. We have the 1 and 2 If... books, the teenage version and the Soul version."
1,not very thought provoking,"Based on all the great reviews this book had, I expected to find some stellar, thought-provoking questions. Instead I found some rather ho-hum questions that anyone with a little imagination could come up with. Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this purchase. So if you are looking for creative and entertaining questions that would be fun to ask your friends at a party, save yourself the money and use your own imagination. Trust me, it will probably be better than the questions you'll find in this book."
1,thought it was something else,"My girlfriend and I have done several couples related books that we fill out and exchange, which is what i thought this book would be. But it was more of seemingly conversation starters i returned this product"
3,no cd,The product worked but it didn't come with the cd.I ordered two and both didn't have the cd.Thepeople at compucessory were going to try and get one from the factorybut no word fron them.
2,Stocking stuffer at most,"Doll is very thin and definitely not ""plush"" as name implies. Wouldn't recommend for anything more than an expensive stocking stuffer."
4,evocative photos and Tibetan artwork,"Fascinating work by a photographer who has made many trips to Zanskar. His pictures show the people, the temples and the landscape and emphasize just how harsh the climate really is. In the accompanying text he describes the experiences of he and his wife living with the local people. Interspersed with this are wonderful Buddhist watercolors by a Tibetan artist"
5,"Very clear, cogent discussion of our humanity","While many ""self-help"" or recovery books seem stilted or caught up in their own wisdom, Bill's thoughts are very elegant and illuminating... Elegant in their simplicity and comforting in their honesty and apparent truth. This book has been a great comfort to me in a time of great turmoil in my life. Thank you for sharing with us...."
5,The Zen of Recovery,"While a large part of addiction is an escape from feeling and living in the pain and suffering of the present moment, this book offers a profoundly inspirational, yet simple perspective to guide recovery from alcoholism and other forms of addiction.William Alexander uses mindfulness teachings and meditation to ultimately help achieve transcendence from the addiction. In the present moment, Alexander explains, is where we achieve our healing and wholeness."
4,Page size is too small,"The story is wonderful, but the small size of this book does not do justice to the extremely detailed artwork, which was originally published with A4-sized pages. Anybody who has seen the artwork in its original size will find this series disappointing. There are plenty of large-sized graphic novels---I wonder why Viz decided to reduce the page size of Nausicaa?"
5,The most obsorbing book I've read to date,"If a graphic novel could ever be considered a great work of litterature, then that graphic novel would be Nausicaa. It is an engrossing story with well developed, likable characters."
1,not pleased at all,"PRESSMAN GIANT GARDEN TENNIS - I was s-o-o displeased with this product! The racquets seemed durable, but the net was very cheaply built. The net itself is so thin and flimsy...I think a butterfly could fly into and and probably break it. I was so mad at myself for falling for buying something that I could'nt actually touch and feel before I bought it. I guess I can at least use the racquets for swatting bumble bees while sitting on the back porch :- ("
4,Overall very nice,I think this is a good tennis set. You might need to lay a brick or rock on the feet because it will get knocked down if it's in a backyard. Had a fun time playing with this set and since I'm no pro the large rackets worked well for us.
4,If a tree falls...,"It's sad to see a great album like this and the previous ""on"" be totally ignored and worse, not even reviewed here by the people who were involved with this. I just pulled both CD's out of my collection and put them on. They are terrific albums. Great simple rock music. Interesting tunes, challenging and wry lyrics and a nice tight sound. This is simeply great rock and roll. Not too loud and angry not to soft and wimpy. The word ""warm"" comes to mind. I only came upon these by way of the ""I wonder what ever happened to..."" file. Take a chance. You won't be disappointed. Open the windows, put the top down and drive."
5,great little cooker,I previously had a much larger capacity one (made in Germany) for many years. I finally got fed up with the burnt rice and the hard deposits on the teflon bowl that could only be removed by a several day soak in soap water and then a hard scrub with a plastic equivalent of steel wool.To test this cooker I did a 1/6 load (ending up with a half cup of cooked rice) which would test the burning capacity. (little rice and full heating power) I was pleasantly surprised. The rice was not a bit burnt and the teflon coated bowl had absolutely no residue on it.
4,Little expensive but perfect,I am using it everyday for probably 2 months and so far it is working great. I like the fature that it shutsoff after rice is cooked that is the reason I bought this for. The reason that I didn't give five stars is because I am only using it for 2 months and also I felt its a little expensive and also the shipping charges.
5,Still works great!,We've had this rice cooker for a few years now and it works great!! We use it almost everyday and it's still going strong. I love it!
5,Baby Rice Cooker,"Excellent service, working beautifully. I love the item. For a small family with a tiny appetite, the best product to make your rice."
5,dog harness,The leash and harness I purchased for my toy poodle make a nice matching set. Very satisfied
3,good shot,"Let me start by saying that I think Jesse Sykes has one of the most fascinating voices around (think a middle-aged Marianne Faithfull), and that I loved her album ""Oh My Girl"". But I have to say that the energy from that record is painfully lacking here. The songs are good, in some cases outstanding, but they often fade into boring, forgetable vamps that all blend together to make one sluggish piece of music by the end. I whole-heartedly recomend her live show; in it she shows that she can in fact sing the ballads...but she can do a little western boogie just as good."
5,Casts a Spell,"Sykes opens this compelling, sometimes spectral disc with a bit of heavy-hearted Neil Young harmonica and acoustic guitar framing her mournful, cigarette-scarred voice. ""Is this still a good place to be?"" she sings. That sets the tone for an album of questioning lyrics framed in catchy melodies propelled by former Whiskeytowner Phil Wandscher's surprisingly muscular electric guitar.Sykes is unsure, about her lover, about the present and the future, her voice conveying that uncertainty. ""The Air Is Thin"" is a captivating ballad with a bit of trumpet while ""You Might Walk Away"" is an immediate favorite, a straight-ahead pop rocker punctuated by hand claps.In fact, the disc isn't easily pegged apart from Sykes' world weary voice. The arrangements are varied and easily carry you through the 12 tracks, leaving you only to rise from the spell it induces to hit play again."
3,"Good, Not Great","This album, unfortunately, is a bit of a disappointment compared to the two previous albums. More commercial and comparatively over-produced, this album lacks the musical integrity and authenticity of Reckless Burning or Oh, My Girl, and verges on becoming just another well-done country/rock album, indistinguishable from others. Hope this is not the direction the band will continue to take, as if it is, I will satisfy myself with their first two albums and ignore the rest."
2,"Cute Product, but disappointed in service!","This product took three weeks to be delivered.When the box came, it was crushed, and the wrapped present was smashed. The gift card that was supposed to be with the gift was no where to be seen.The product was fine, but the service was not."
4,Good value and works well,"I needed something to simplify input selection that was previously done through a universal remote - great if you knew how to do it: impossible to teach anyone else in the family! The Recoton SVS1000 S-video has made things much simpler and given me a way to upgrade one of the connections to S-video. The 1/8"" stereo speaker/headphone socket is also good so I can feed the audio into a small Logitech speaker system without replugging. The one disadvantage is having to get up and go over to the unit to change the selection - but that's a small price to pay - and actually reminded me that it wasn't so long ago we had to do that every time we changed the channel on the remoteless TV! Setting the unit up was very easy and I loved that it needed no power to operate - nothing to plug in and nothing to switch off."
2,Video quality is awful,"The other reviews are bewildering. This switch IS easy to use, but the output is absolutely terrible. You'll get blurriness and dot crawl added to any input. I don't consider myself skilled at seeing video imperfections, so it's not a subtle problem. It's very, very obvious and it's simply unacceptable."
1,Nice at first.,"Horrible product, great idea. Starts out fine and then top portion of mattress no longer stays inflated. The first one I ordered failed in this way and so did the second one I got as a replacement. 2 beds in 7 months? No thanks. Looking into a refund as we speak, this is ridiculous."
5,Great product!,"The Wenzel Sig Series Airbed is one of the best purchases I've made! It has more than exceeded my expectations in durability & comfort. It's quite heavy, but that's expected with a high-quality airbed."
2,Disappointed,"I had two and one-half weeks of joy in having this bed, then it started loosing air like a balloon. I have to pump it up every 20 minutes now. The design needs improving. I am disappointed."
2,Inflating bed,"While inflating this bed, the bed never reaches the desired firmness and is sagging in the center, thus causing anyone who sleeps on it to tilt towards the center of the bed"
1,Don't waste your money!,"The concept is great but until they perfect (or at the very least improve) the design and whatever the problem is with the inflation, don't waste your money. The bed never fully inflates to a firm touch. It sags in the middle before you even get in. Once you're in, the bed billows around you. I didn't think much about the bed losing air the first night as the instruction say, ""it stretches, etc."" However, after five nights of having to add air throughout the night, it's time to return the bed! Apparently the sagging and air loss problems are common. Read the other reviews."
1,Do not buy this!,Do not buy this airbed. It loses air in the upper chamber. Causing you to sink in the middle of the bed. For the amount of money I paid for this product it would seem that the company would work out the bugs before they put this product on the market.
1,Not worth it!!,"This bed is a great concept, but it ends there, it's not well put togther! It works well, it seems at first...but not for long...got many small, difficult to locate holes on the many various seams & was impossible & futile to try & patch them all. It ended up deflating constantly, and was a waste of money!! My advice...figure out something else, don't spend the money on this product! Good conceptual idea, poorly executed."
3,Great sci-Fi fun!,"Here are some rare flicks, old Sci-Fi fodder than most have forgotten about, but its a nice set and well worth the money."
1,if your @ an advanced level with fr,then i recommend a grammar written for fr ppl by fr ppl. Bescherelle is not bad. this book is overpriced and somewhat confusing although better that gainville price's published by blackwell. fr is an easy laguage for us anglophones. just apreciate the sublties and try to copy fixed paterns more then remembering abstracted grammaticle prescriptions and you'll fly through it aquiring a sound base in fr upon which you can suppliment with more vocabularies and literary structures. good luck friends!
3,they are grommets,What else can I say. They are white and as promised. I wish I could have purchased less than 5.
5,Dance music is ALIVE again!,"Now this is a mix album. James has really upped the anty from his previous outing ""Sound in Motion"". This latest mix really showcases what the Zabiela sound is all about. Seemlessly weaving breaks, prog and tech. house through 2 discs, James has crafted a new standard for which the next generation of DJ's should follow. James has an ear for a ""tune"" but never overplays his hand. He keeps the listener intrigued as he changes his styles up constantly over the two discs. Both discs are excellent and his mixing is lightyears ahead of some of these so called ""A-list"" DJ's. While dance music has teetered on the brink of pure self-indulgence over the last few years, ""Alive"" brings back the love and energy to the genre. The scene needs more innovators like James...bravo mate!"
4,Tricky to get into...,"I've had this mix for about six months and am just now starting to appreciate it. Part of the problem is when DJ's start off with something that stinks it's hard to get past that, and the Diplomat track really, really stinks. I understand that Z is trying to be eclectic, but it's probably safe to leave the genre ""cheesy eighties [...]"" out.A lot of hardcore trance DJ's have responded to the universal hatred of trance by turning into chillout DJ's, with awful results, like Sasha's slimy Fundacion debacle. Zabiela's approach (he's apparently a Sasha protege) is to reach out to other sounds without giving up the basic idea: hard, deep, electronic bass riffs that make you want to get up and dance.It's true disk 2 is better, there are some nice tracks on it, but disk 1 is good too. Just skip past the insipid ""The Number One MC & DJ Crew"" track. Ugh."
1,Sorry...but mmmm no.,I can't believe the ratings that people are giving this. There are a total of 2...yes 2 solid tracks on the entire double album. Maybe it's because Zabiela's style just isn't to my liking...or maybe my tastes in electronica have evolved into something different but after 5 minutes of listening to whacked out samples and non-congruent sounds I had to turn it off. Take a look at my other reviews. If you like any of my recommendations then please don't buy this album. Save yourself the money cause it definatly isn't worth it.
4,good,i order this DVD is ok but not too clear but is ok for the price out side in the Indians city is more expensive than here so not bad but i am not using it anymore
1,Still a child-woman at 53,"Thin and graceful from early ballet lessons, the heroine has a) never loved her husband b) gets cancer c) finds a lover who will cradle and baby her up to a point. Details apparently added to build character simply make the book longer. Sex scenes are embarrassing and many of the details--the slotted spoon, the hair artlessly coming undone--are banal. Yuchchch."
2,"Big build-up, mostly disappointing.","Jaffee's supposedly ""sensitive"" portrayal didn't seem all that special to me. Her characters didn't gain any insight or grow; they were the same selfish, and vaguely unhappy people at the end that they were at the beginning. The sex scenes seemed like a parody. The only positive aspect of this book is that it is a mercifully short and quick read."
2,Started Out Nice . . .,"This is the first book that I have read by this author. It started out very nice, building the characters and I was looking forward to Susanne and Robert getting together. . . Robert seemed wonderful at first, but then he really disapointed me. The ending disapointed me... The book disapointed me. . . I guess I had better stick with authors that I know."
4,Hungarian Flag with Crest,Good product for the price. I collect rare and historic flags this is a good budget flag for the money. Good for festivals and parties. Would not fly out in the rain and harsh outdoor weather. A welcome addition to my collection.
4,Fascinating historical,"Electa Bryan Plummer was the outlaw Henry Plummer's wife. Little else is known of her, but in this novel, author Pat Pfeiffer brings Electa and the last days of Henry Plummer to life in a tale that rings with truth.Pfeiffer tells the story from a split point of view. In the first, upon her death, Electa's son sets out to solve the mystery of his mother's past after he is left three enigmatic clues. The trail leads him to 1912 Montana, and Henry Plummer's ill-gotten gold, which in truth, has never been found.Next, Alexa takes up her own story, telling us of her hopes, fears and aspirations. With her, we experience the tremendous hardship at the missionary endeavor of Sun River Farm, 1862 Montana Territory, and later, her growing distrust of her husband as the sheriff's wife in the gold camp of Bannack, Montana.The story makes for fascinating reading as Electa follows a path of disillusionment in her marriage, and redemption in her escape."
3,"22 titles, none listed. Hmm","I would like to buy, but am looking for a few specifics works that are part of the comlete collection: Plutarch, Emerson, Adams (Wealth of Nations) any of these included? I can't contact seller any other way. Did this work?:)"
1,Not needed,I thought that this was needed for my add-on Pioneer HD radio. The Crutchfield instructions said to only hook up my truck antenna to the HD Radio and not the head unit. I should have paid attention. I didn't and bought this. I had to take it out to get full HD reception. Save yourself some time.
4,Another Book,"This book was wonderful just like the others before it, Untamed and Forbidden. Like the reviewer before me I want to read a book with Erik."
2,"has great potential, but disappointing","(...) While it presents many ideas with great potential, the character development suffers mightily and the dialogue is typical inelegantly-presented medieval romance. Ariane's personality is inconsistently portrayed and both Ariane's and Simon's inner monlogues are irritatingly unrealistic and lacking in depth. Much of the story remained unsaid, the inclusion of which would have added much needed texture and depth.""Enchantment"" could do with an expanded rewrite - it has the potential to be a great medieval romance if rethought and rewritten into its full impressive potential."
5,Simply Divine,"Ms. Lowell follows her series through! Simon & Arianna sizzle. Their characters exude sensuality. She also includes other characters rather than making it only about them. In her previous books in the series she also includes her characters, but even if you don't read them in order it will not confuse you. She introduced Eric & I am waiting for his book with Serena... Then maybe one about Sven he is mysterious. You get drawn in & she leaves you wanting more. Ms Lowell is simply a divine writer who has class not crass in her writing style. I just wish I didn't have to wait soooo long for her other books."
3,Only ever-so-slightly enchanted,"Initially,it was the beginning that enchanted me:""Which will it be,"" Ariane whispered to herself, ""a wedding or a wake?""I'm fascinated by myths recreating themselves into our present time.The author's real name is Ann Maxwell, a Scottish family bedevilled by such archetypes.What jarred, a little, was a too-modern style of writing, more on the lines of Barbara Cartland (this is a personla opinion!) when Lowell's choice of subject demands more authenticity."
3,A disappointment,I was disappointed when this tape arrived. Accustomed to enjoying Elizabeth Lowell's books on tape I was surprised this story had been condensed onto only one tape. I was even more dissappointed when I heard a woman speaking with no accent.
2,Just didn't get it...,I've seen nothing but pretty high ratings and rave reviews for this one so I'm kind of confused at what the heck's going on...Obviously it's my problem...From page one I kept hearing the Twilight Zone theme in the back of my mind because this book was just no way around it weird! The characters were ok I guess so my issue isn't there...I like paranormal/truth seers/witches novels so that's not what threw me off...So maybe it's the writing or just the whole storyline itself...Shoot I don't have a clue! But for the life of me (even though I tried really hard) I can't grasp the reasons for all the praise surrounding this book. I guess that's what makes us all so uniquely special...Some things we get...and some things we don't.
3,At least I finished it,"This book was just too mystical for me. Almost everyone seemed to have a ""gift,"" even the dress. I definitely won't bother with the others in this series."
3,Audio Would Be Better if An English Accent Had Been Used!,"Enchanted by Elizabeth Lowell was good but not the best audiobook I've listened to! Ariane and Simon are the romantic pair and I liked them just fine, I enjoyed the audiobook for the most part and it's being condensed to one tape didn't really bother me as much as it has bothered other reviewers prehaps because I knew I was buying it condensed on one tape but actually what bothered me was that the woman who did the reading didn't use an English accent, the bottom line is if you are making an audiobook recording of a romance book set in England you either need to have the reader be from England or have the American reader put on an English accent! I would recommend that people who like audiobooks of romance book's set in England to be read with an English accent to just buy the book, unless the fact that the reader didn't use an English accent dosesn't bother you!"
5,SUCH A WONDERFUL READ THAT I AM LEFT CRAVING FOR MORE,"UNTAMED, ENCHANTED, AND FORBIDDEN HAVE GOT TO BE THE THE BEST (AND I MEAN ""BEST"") ROMANCE NOVEL'S THAT I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF READING. I'M SURE THAT I CAN SPEAK FOR THE REST OF ELIZIBETH LOWELL'S FAN'S WHEN I ASK THAT SOMEONE ""PLEASE"" SOMEHOW REACH HER AND BEG HER TO TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE ERIK AND SVEN'S STORIES. IT HAS BEEN LIKE BEING TOTALLY ENGROSSED IN A MOVIE OR MINI SERIES AND MISSING OUT ON THE ENDING. WE WANT MORE OF ENCHANTED, MORE OF UNTAMED AND MORE OF FORBIDDEN.I'M AN ADDICT AND I NEED A FIX."
4,Magical,"I believe everyone has unique gifts that are their very own. This is an magical, highly charged book with characters who are aware of their miraculous traits and use them to conquer whatever life throws at them.The enchanted dress ahhh; wish we could all be so lucky to receive such a wonderful wedding gift.The powerful emotions of this book built to wonderful heated intimate moments between Simon and Ariane. They were a bit over the top for me and I won't be reading Forbidden because I just don't want those pictures floating around my brain.But the story is so good I rate this a 4+"
3,Enchanted,"If this book was by a new author, I would have given it 4 stars and said ""well done"". However, having read several of Ms Lowell's work, I have a certain expectation, which caused some disappointment with Enchanted. It started off real slow, took some time to grab me. Even though I loved the previous book about Amber and appreciated the follow-up, Enchanted almost gave equal treatment to her, rather than focusing on the heroine."
4,Enchanted,"If you love historical romances with a twist, then you will love this title by Elizabeth Lowell. The plot is somewhat strange, but eventually you will figure it out. I loved the other world aspect of special gifts given to Lowell's main female characters during a time period when women were primarily viewed as second class citizens."
5,"Excellent, but what about Erik and Sven??","This series truly moved me. I've always been entranced by the beauty and brutality of this particular era, and Lowell captured it beautifuly. My most heartfelt thanks to her! But what about Erik and Sven? There has to be, somewhere it their savage world, women that can capture the hearts and souls of these incredibly independent, facinating, unique men? Could you imagine the woman that would be able to catch Sven? What a woman! And someone who would be able to deal with Erik? Wow! Please, Elizabeth, consider and give in to the pleas of your devoted readers! We would be endlessly appreciative!"
2,stuhrling Cupid II Skeleton Automatic Watch,I love the look of this watch. The face is large and the watch is pretty - just what I wanted. However I am very sad that this watch does not work for me. I have my hands in water a lot and because the band seems to be covered in fabric I take it off. Possibly due to this every time I put the watch on I have to reset it and restart it. I'm guessing that one must wear it constantly all day long to keep it wound so that it will work.
2,Watch look refurbish and missing tag,"I myself own more than 10 stuhrling watches. This is first time purchase from amazon llc. I am disappointed. The watch came with missing stuhrling tag. One look I know something is amiss because i bought many before and the way this watch was pack isn't original. The auto movement also sound cranky compared to all the other auto I own. Sadly, I am now not in US and it make no sense for me to pay shipping for refund or exchange unless amazon willing to pay for overseas return mail fee."
3,Good Guide,"The edition is as complete a guide for the mian lines of Hall China as you can probably find, however I think the photo layout and quality were better int he previous version."
4,Nor for anyone over 2nd or 3rd grade,"My son enjoyed this book; however, going into 4th grade, it is a bit too easy. He read it in less than a day which is not really the objective of summer reading...."
5,7x9=trouble,"I recommend this book for kids that are having trouble in math,because in the book there are some multiplication rymes,and,patterns that will help kids with there times tables."
4,7x9=trouble review,7x9=Trouble is funny and realistic. Wilson can't Finish his times tables until May14th and he had a little brother that bothers him when he's practicing the times tables. Also when you finish your times tables you'll get an ice cream cone. It was a good book because the ending is a bit funny and throughout the book it is funny. It is realistic because I was stuck on my multiplication in 3rd grade. Another reason I liked the book is that squiggles gets lost which he class pet. That's why 7x9=trouble is a really good book to read.
1,Terrible,It was broken right out of the box. I touched to activate the battery and broke the dial. Too fragile and a bad design.
2,"dull, dull, dull","nothing in this book will be new to anyone remotely active in going to football games. it's looking very dated now and contains few interesting anecdotes or tales. in summary, middle aged blokes go to football games and some of these blokes use euro away trips as an excuse to get lashed, vist brothels and generally behave badly in foreign cities. oh, and touts sell tickets for big games too and sometimes accommodate slightly unsavoury characters on their trips by arranging their transport and tickets."
3,Was Not Expecting it,I really thought it was an actual book but it turned out to be spiral bound and nothing near what I was hoping for.
1,Ghastly appearance,"I vehemently oppose the review published by the late ""Professional"" Orian Lee. I myself succumbed to the enormous social pressure of professional suavity and, thus, purchased this item. I thought the Samsonite Classic would compliment my Armani eloquently. Upon its arrival, however, I was dismayed by the ghastly lump of Tantalum metal. The erratic reflection of silver and azure undoubtedly clashed with my professional elegance. My atrocious experience leaves me no choice yet to discourage all consumers from this professional death trap."
5,A real winner!,"Unlawful Deeds kept me guessing right up to the final pages. Mr Brody has assembled an excellent cast of characters, suspenseful plot twists, and delivers his unique insight on the crazy world of Boston real estate in the late 80's!"
4,In the Style of John Grisham's Best Legal Thrillers,This was an exciting legal thriller. The writing and action gets better as the books progresses. The end was as exciting as any of John Grisham's best thrillers. The main charactors are quickly established and I cared what happened to them.
5,Page turner....,Unlawful Deeds was a book that was difficult to put down. It's view of the 1980's Boston real estate market combined with the murder/mystery presented a fascinating plot. I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel...
2,Grisham has nothing to worry about,"One of the reasons I bought this book was because of the great reviews and the comparisons to Grisham, whom I love. Well, maybe it's me, but this is about the dumbest book I ever read. The dialogue is a bit unbelievealbe and juvenile at times and you know ""who did it"" well before the end of the book. It's a decent story, but Brody is no where near the league of an articulate and intelligent storyteller as Grisham."
2,Potential lost,"This book had so much potential but it unfortunately fell quite short in the end. Insight into Sarah's visual impairment is disclosed in interesting ways but the author clearly put too much effort into explaining how Sarah functions. The perfectly lovely storyline gets lost in all this disability-related talk. There was quite a bit of conversation over what she couldn't do, which was disappointing to me though the author did succeed in making blindness somewhat cool to young readers."
4,the studd,i bought this a while ago but now its green tagged 4 dollars off he fueded mostly with andre as a bad guy then he turned into a good guy so if you have andre this would make a nice opponent but he has a painted chest hair which make scense and it looks just like him but he isn't that popular or well know these days so only recommended for older wrestling fans not younger kids who only know now wrestlers then i would recommend a john cena or batista and if jakks reads this create razor ramon with a ladder or anyone else with a ladder
5,Another great classic superstar,"Ever since I saw the first classic superstars come out, I wanted to get as many as I could and hoped they would make everyone (as impossible as that may be, still would be great). Big John Studd was a star of the late 70's/early 80's that was feared by most as being one of the largest men in wrestling (Andre The Giant being the larger of the two). This figure is dead on Big John Studd as the detail to what he looked like is amazing. The figure has his white tights and with red boots which is what I remember him wearing often and also sports the 3 stars on each side of the tights. He has a big built and painted on hair covering most of his which is a nice detail. He comes with a chair and a microphone which neither say anything on them. This is a great addition to any collection and I recommend getting them all as it is great to get all these classic figures which we thought we'd never see."
2,Not durable enough,"Had one of these units for a few years, but didn't experience a battery problem until recently. When I attempted to connect the unit to my battery, the positive jumper clamp (plastic) snapped in half, rendering the unit useless for its intended purpose. An examination of the negative clamp revealed that it was heavily cracked also, and would have given way in short order as well. Given that I'd never even used the jump starting capability of the unit before, I'm going to chalk this up to the use of cheap materials. As such, it's hard to recommend.The compressor and power output functions seemed to work as intended however."
1,Totally useless,"Wouldn't even jump my little Saab 9-3 in warm weather. In fact, it wasn't even close. When I turned the ignition, the engine barely even made a sound. But at least it got the radio working! So if you're out there stranded with a dead battery in the middle of a storm, you can listen to some tunes. Thanks Black and Decker! And Amazon won't let you return it because it is a ""hazardous"" product. What a waste of money."
2,Not enough amps to start a car,"I would not recommend this product for jump starting your car. I recharged it several times and it did not even turn over my car battery. It may be powerful enough to start a lawnmower or some other small vehicle, but not a car. My son brought over his charger (his has more amps) and my care started immediately."
1,Don't buy the Presto 09402 Mypod Refillable Personal Pod/coffee Holder +100 Extra Filters,RE: PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THIS ALSO BOUGHT: Presto 09402 Mypod Refillable Personal Pod/coffee Holder +100 Extra FiltersDON'T BUY THIS! IT DOESN'T FIT THE BLACK AND DECKER. IT'S DESIGNED FOR A PHILLIPS COFFEEMAKER! SOMEBODY AT AMAZON HAS SCREWED UP BADLY!NOW I'M OUT Item Subtotal: $9.99Shipping & Handling: $8.40Total: $18.39DRAT!LM
4,great little product,"I like this little coffee maker. It is quick, convenient and doesn't have a lot of waste like a regular coffee maker. Your coffee doesn't sit in the pot and get cold or over heated. You do need to read the directions before setting it up to avoid unnescessary frustration. This product is a a good value for the price."
1,Black and Decker gt300,It doesn't work correctly. THere is something messed up in the electronics. Lots of lights flash and the unit locks up.
1,Waste of time and money. Buyer beware,"I received this product today and tried all afternoon to get coffee out of it. All I wound up with was hot brown liquid that tasted like plastic. What a disappointment. I also bought the Presto My Pod device for using ground coffee in the thing. Another waste of money. Since both the companies I bought these items from basically have a no return policy, don't answer phone calls or emails, I'm basically out $50 for nothing. Word to the wise - read the return policy if the seller is not Amazon.Update 1-8-09 = Many, many attempts to contact orangeonions about this product have failed. They don't answer phone calls or emails. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY."
1,Black & Decker GT300 Pod Coffeemaker,"I am very disappointed in this product. I have the original version of this product which I used everyday for two years; and after it broke, ordered this one as the original version was no longer available. This was supposed to be an improved version; maybe the machine itself was improved, but the resulting coffee product was not. The resulting coffee tasted and smelled like plastic, no hint of coffee flavor at all. It did not even smell like coffee as it was brewing. I tried different pods, even tried using two pods at once, same plastic tasting result every time. I gave the product two weeks, hoping the plastic taste and smell would go away, no improvement. I am now stuck with a useless machine as the shippers policy is not to take back opened and used returns. I will write Black and Decker about my disappointment in their product."
1,"If you like luke warm, weak coffee this is a great buy.","Even with double pods, a small cup of coffee from this machine is weak. Like a prior reviewer I have to put the cup in the microwave for a minute to heat it up to reasonable temps.Don't waste the little money this thing costs. You get what you pay for."
1,Don't waist your money!,"I bought this coffee maker, plus a bunch of different brand pods. I purchased this because of online reviews posting this as a good machine. I even bought one for my mother-in-law. I didn't want to buy the high priced K-cup machine.I have tried everything and can not get a decent cup of coffee. Sometimes the machine gives me less than the 7oz or 9oz that I've selected. I've doubled and even tripled the pods per cup and I'm not a espresso lover. The coffee is ALWAYS weak - perfect if you like tinted water. Even my mother-in-law can't get a good cup, so it's not just my machine.I expected more from Black & Decker. I gave it one star only because the online review makes you select something and it doesn't provide negative stars."
3,Black & Decker Single Serve Pod Brewer,"This is an excellent coffe maker for asingle serving. It is quick and by experimentingI have found some pods that make a better thanaverage cup of coffee. The only draw back isthat it is noisy, but for only a minute while itbrings the water to temperature. I personally donot like scalding hot coffee so, this machinemakes it hot enough for me. Maybe it won't befor someone who likes very hot coffee."
2,Works well when it works,"I bought this coffee maker and thought it was great. I loved the choices of 7 oz, 14 oz, creamy (for cappuccino)and it was high enough to put my tall coffee mug under it. It was a bit noisy but made a decent cup of coffee and was very handy for a quick cup of coffee for a guest. After a few uses, it stopped working...lights flashing, nothing happening. The company promptly replaced it for me. Used the second one a couple of times a week for about 4 months and the same thing happened. I gave up on it. I was disappointed because I did like it very much WHEN it worked."
2,Leaks,About half the time this coffee maker leaks where the holding tank joins the coffee maker. Attempts to contact Orangeonions for a refund or replacement have failed. I guess I'm stuck with it.
2,Coffee not strong enough,"We have tried numerous brands and types of coffee pods, but so far the only one that has delivered any flavor is Senseo Cappuccino. Other pods seem to taste watered down. We are not strong coffee drinkers and yet the coffee from this machine with Home Craft pods seems to taste weak and watery."
2,Don't purchase,I would not purchase this item again. It is very finicky and works when it wants to. It has something to do with the seal around the pod and pod holder. We have to squeeze it together to get it to seal properly. Sometimes it leaks water from the holding tank.
1,don't buy this model,Bought this model. Would not brew a full cup of coffee no matter what I did. Called customer service and they sent me a new one. This one also did not work. All it did was flash blue lights and never brewed a cup. Tossed it out and bought a different model by Black and Decker. Have had it for months and never had a problem with the new model.
1,Won't work,"I cannot get this machine to work, I have tried everything. It just buzzes and then two lights blink. I have unplugged it, redid every step, etc. Nothing. Very frustrating...."
2,"Worked great, for 3 days.","Bought this for my wife for Christmas. Very simple to use and made a great cup of coffee (per my wife, I don't drink coffee). It lasted a total of 3 days. On the third day all it would do is flash two of the blue lights. Wouldn't beep, would'nt pump water, nothing. Believe all the negative reviews you keep reading and stay far away from this unit."
1,junk,"This machine is garbage. Get a $20 4-cup programmable coffee pot instead--it will make actual, real, drinkable coffee, as opposed to the coffee-scented hot water this machine produces. I am giving mine to charity. N.B.: the ""presto"" thingie to use your own coffee instead of pods that amazon will try to sell you with it does not work with this machine."
1,Awful Taste!!,"The coffee pods are very expensive, and the coffee is weak and has a really funky taste. I have ran lots of water through the system, but it didn't help. I have tried Senseo, Folgers and the Capachino pods and the bad taste is always there. YUCK!!"
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"Short and not so sweet:First unit did not work at all,Second unit worked for about 3 months, then sporatically, then quit.I should have believed the other reviewers.Going to try the Senseo Supreme unit now."
1,Dreadful small appliance,From the first day I got this coffee maker it wouldn't work...it would not bring the water from the reservoir through to the coffee pod. Spoke with customer service at length & they finally agreed the thing was defective. I returned it & received a replacement...two days later...same problem. Recommendation....do not waste your money on this model! Only reason I'm giving it one star is because I'm forced to rate it or this review would not be published.
4,A Great Individual Coffeemaker for an Unbelievable Price,"This coffeemaker is even better the second time around...I bought one several years ago to use at work. It finally bit the dust, and I decided to replace it with a new one of the same brand. The new one is more sturdy; the pod holder pops ups and down much better, and it has a light to show when to brew cycle is complete. The coffee tastes great, and the price was only $19.99!"
5,Easy,This coffeemaker is wonderful. I use it just for me on the weekends. It makes just what I want and doesn't waste as much coffee. I love it!!
2,"Convenient, not tasty.","I like decaf, my husband likes high test. We both agree that the coffee tastes like water. I brew with the strongest roast at the lowest (7oz) setting. Still . . . tastes like water. Sometimes I get up in the morning and look at my pitiful machine and drive to Starbucks."
1,"Can you say, ""what a waste?""","I brought this machine to work to be able to make one cup of coffee at a time. It worked great for less than a week and then gave up. A little cool water would run through and then the two top blue lights would flash. Took out the coffee and tried just plain water. Nothing. Unplugged, refilled, cursed, prayed, begged... nothing. What a waste!"
1,Decent coffee...poor quality,"I purchased my first one last November 2006...it didn't work out of the box. I returned it...it worked for about a month. I called customer service and they sent me a replacement in January. I enjoyed pretty good coffee until October 2007. Well, it's not working again. I wouldn't waste my money on this machine."
1,Not Satisfied,"I have been disappointed with this purchase from day one. It makes weak, watery coffee. The only pod that works well in it is the Folgers 100% Columbian (super strong). It does not have a programmable feature, so have to wait for it to do it's thing in the morning. But the most disappointing thing is that after one year of service, it broke! It just suddenly stopped working, and gives me the ""water out"" signal, even though it's full of water, with water dripping out of the top. Also stopped heating, so the little bit of water that comes out is cold. Now I have to buy another coffeemaker, and I guarantee it won't be this one!"
5,"Great Machine, BUT you must read the Manual if you want a great cup of coffee.","When all else fails.... read the instructions!1. The machine must be ""primed"" before using for the first time. MAKE sure you fill the water container AND only use the ""ONE pod"" holder (without a coffee pack). If you use the ""TWO pod"" holder, the machine will NOT prime.2. If you do not want ""watery"" coffee, MAKE sure you compress the coffee pods. Initially, I used two pods and did not compress them, and I was extremely disappointed. However, the next time I compressed them into the holder, selected the 7oz button, and WOW!... a really strong cup of coffee (7oz). Next time when I use two pods (and compress them), I will select the 9oz button.3. Save money (lots of it)- BUY the Presto model #09403 ""MyPod"" refillable coffee holder, add your own coffee, and REMEMBER... compress the coffee grounds.4. If the unit ""Locks""... read the manual- it states how to Unlock the unit without having to break it."
1,Makes a great cup of plastic,First off the machine would not register that the reserve was full of water. Had to mess with it several times to get it to work and run it through the cleaning mode. Once it did work the smell of plastic while it brewed was a bit concerning. The coffee had the same aroma and even had a weird plastic taste to it. So after several attempts of cleaning and re-brewing (and wasting pods) everyone in the kitchen agreed that it makes a great hot cup of plastic tasting brown stuff.
1,"If you like coffe that tastes like plastic, buy this model!!","Like another reviewer we thought this model looked great on the shelf and had several features we didn't see on some other models. As good as it looked, however, the coffee tastes HORRIBLE! Tastes like plastic, even smells like plastic while brweing. Tried everything to get rid of taste, including running two bags of pods through it. Nothing helped!Finally called B&D; and they told me to return the unit to the place we got it from. They claimed that we were the first consumers ever to repoert this problem."
4,El escenario esta servido para el curso final,"Buen libro. Definitivamente mejor que la quinta entrega. Aqui se desvela el misterio de Snape. Lo unico reprochable es que la explicacion de por que Dumbledore creia en Severus Snape, es demasiado escueta y de verdad no le encuentras ninguna clase de logica. Se habla poco o casi nada de los Dursley, supongo que sera la misma tonica de la ultima parte. Si te lo preguntas, pues, no hablan nada de Sirius Black (el quinto libro deja una pequeña duda en relacion a como se puede comunicar Harry con el en el arco)"
3,Santa Paws,I was EXTREMELy disappointed that this seller sold me a dvd that I can ONLY watch on my computer and NOT on my dvd! Then she even had the GALL to email me and tell ME I was RUDE!!! what kind of people are these types of sellers Amazon??? All I know is I will NEVER buy from this person again so hum bug back at ya!
3,cheesy and tired,"Let me start by saying that I usually like silly kid's movies, but this one got tired and old. The storyline was good, but the musical-like singing bits throughout the movie put a damper on it. O.K. for kids 8 (ish) and younger, but not enjoyable for adults."
5,Search for Santa Paws,This was a very enjoyable entertaining Christmas Movie. The story lines were well done and exciting. Yes for The Search for Santa Paws.
1,Despicable & Disturbing. PLEASE REVIEW before children!,"I regret having not viewed this prior to my 5-year daughter watching it. She was terribly disturbed with the abusive caregiver locking the children in the basement and burning all their toys. (Really, Disney??) Toward the end of the movie, the living, breathing puppy turned stuffed animal was headed into the incinerator along with the the girl trying in an attempt to rescue it. This onset a huge dialogue with lots of disturbing questions. My daughter couldn't stop asking if there really were mean mommies that would do this to their children. I felt heartbroken I hadn't shielded my child from this -- all because I fell for the cute fluffy puppy on the cover and the ""G"" rating. This movie ought to be burned in the incinerator.Amazon must really give the option of NO star. I'd really like to know what kind of producer can go to bed at night having created such a despicable movie."
1,Oakland Dad,"If there is a worse Christmas movie than Santa Paws, I have yet to see it. Disney should be embarrassed to put this kind of movie out. It has the production quality of a Barney show. It uses every single Christmas movie cliche there is, then adds a cute puppy and a sadistic head of an orphanage who abuses children. My daughter insisted that I turn it off through tears. It was just too cruel. And with no point, no redeeming quality whatsoever. This is not an ""instant classic"", but a classic failure. The dialogue and acting are almost as horrible as the songs. My mother bought it for my daughter because she saw it so many times on the Safeway aisle during Christmas. I was surprised when she told me she had not actually seen it. A great boon for Disney marketing, but not a market honestly attained by a quality movie. I would rate this movie zero stars, but I had to click on a star to publish this review."
2,Creepy Santa Claus!,"It kept my son's attention for a little while, but I swear that Santa Claus would give anyone nightmares! When he first came into the picture I was thinking, ""No wonder they can't find Santa Paws... the dog ran from his freaky looking owner!"" It would have been better if the movie was more focused on the dogs and lessened on the people. Kids love talking animals and stuff. There was too much human interaction in there and I think that's why my son wasn't very interested. Of course my son is under 2 years old too, but he does like watching animals."
4,fun touching story,I watched it several times with my granddaughters ages 6 & 4. They really enjoyed it and I didn't groan when they wanted to watch it again! It's a really cute story.
1,santa paws,"This movie had a nice idea, but very sad. Could not stand the evil foster mom. Kept waiting for her to hit thr girls. And the burner in the basement where all the toys go...... come on..... Even the kids said it was over the top. Too many kids movies are just depressing and this another one. Too bad, the kids were excited to see it. Rent, don't buy."
1,Do Not Buy This Movie,"Unless you want to traumatize your children. My 6-year-old cried for most of the movie. Children's parents dies, abusive foster home, toys and Christmas decorations in an incinerator, Santa hit by a car and robbed, Santa near death in the hospital, dog near death, little girl climbing into an incinerator, kids spending the night locked in a cold, dark basement. The list of offenses goes on. Disney took a serious mis-step with this movie and I will think twice - and do a lot more research - before I buy any more Disney movies. I would give it a ""0"" rating if allowed."
1,Do not Buy!!!!!!!,This movie was so depressing. All 3 of my kids cried numerous times. I kept telling them it would have a happy ending. Cheesy ending at best. Disney should recall this movie. Do not let your children watch this!
1,Not worthy of any stars,Granddaughters aged 4 and 7 were scared to tears and hiding. Should never have bought this DVD. A planned movie evening with visiting granddaughters turned into a disaster. Last Disney DVD I'll ever buy without seeing it first.
1,Rated G for Garbage,"Read the other reviews. This movie had my daughter crying within minutes. Definitely nothing fun about that. How can something be rated G if you have to watch Santa get hit by a taxi and mugged to boot! To top off the drama, the lady who runs the orphanage mistreats the kids."
4,We liked it!,"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to purchase this for my 7 y.o. daughter. She and I watched it together. Yes, there are some parts that younger children may find somewhat scary. My DD cried at the end, but happy tears. All-in-all, we loved it. The Santa is a little creepy looking, and the incinerator can be intimidating, but it has a very happy ending."
4,The Search for Santa Paws,"I ordered two DVDs of The Search for Santa Paws. One of the cases was broken, but the movies were fine and the price was great. I would buy from this seller again."
3,2yr Old Loved It!,"Only reason i gave it 3 stars was cause my kid loved it. Other than that the movie is awful. Bad acting and horrible story line. The Santa and his wife are by far the worst i have ever seen. I could not believe that Disney put out such an awful movie. The reason i bought was for MY TWO YEAR OLD, NOT ME. Its is not an adult movie, so if you are buying to for yourself you will be every disappointed."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"Other reviews are correct!! Santa almost dies,dog turns into a stuffed animal and thrown into furnace,little girl who's parents just died is treated awful in foster home!And let's not even get into the fact that they tell everyone about ""toy store santas"".Nice job,Disney! If Walt were still here,this movie would have never happened.Thank God we just rented it."
2,"Beautiful Puppy, poor movie","Beautiful puppy, horrible storyline and acting. The only thing good about the movie is the beautiful English Cream Golden Retriever."
1,Wretched Movie,It looked so cute but what an incredible disappointment. This movie is scary for young children with lots of mean grownups and frightening situations. The acting is beyond bad. The cute talking dogs are only rarely seen. When the orphans try to do the whole Oliver musical rip off it becomes comical. Watch it if you are interested in really awful MST3000 style but do not get this for your kids!!!!!
4,wonderful christmas movie,"I just had to counter the negative reviews I read on this movie. My 8 and 10 year old girls love this movie and especially enjoy the musical number ""I believe in Christmas."" The child actors are delightful. We watch this movie quite frequently. It has a happy ending. Guess what -- lots of children's literature revolves around orphaned children -- Oliver Twist, The Secret Garden, The Little Princess. I just asked my kids if they thought it was sad and they said yes but they still really like it."
4,Love Christmas Movies!,"I can't say there are any Christmas movies I don't like, but movies about dogs are a particular favorite. This one is a cute tale about a very lovable Great Pyrenees who saves Christmas. Great for all ages. Oh, by the way, our dog is a Great Pyrenees!"
2,cute,This was a cute movie for little kids to watch. I can't see kids wanting to watch this over and over. More of a rental type.
1,If you're waiting for it to get better- it doesn't,"Awful movie. It's dark, depressing and heartbreaking to little ones. I kept thinking to myself ""it has to get better"" so we kept watching.... let me tell you, it actually get worse. I had to sit down and explain to a three year old that toys do not get burned when you are bad, that Santa is real and that Santa didn't really get hurt in this movie. The antagonists far outnumber protagonists in this movie. There is an incinerator where toys get burned when orphans are bad and even the orphans are threatened with being thrown in there. There is talk of Santa not being real, which totally confused my 3 year old who just started believing and understanding who Santa is. It's just not an uplifting, joyful holiday movie like you would think. I have noting nice to say about this movie... I feel totally ripped off."
2,The negetive reviews are about on par for this one,"I got this because I thought it would be a good Christmas movie for our nephews. It was advertised on the Disney channel, and I thought it would be a good Christmas movie. But like all the other reviews said, there is more sad in this movie than anything else. Santa gets hit by the car, and the dog getting thrown into the fire incernirator and the little girl goes in after him. This is stuff that kids shouldn't see. Disney has gotten a lot darker over the years, releasing more sad and adult themed movies than they used to with like say Bambi or Aladdin. Either way, avoid this one and you will be thankful you did. All the happy trailers and stuff and cute movie cover, don't really do the movie justice. That is what drew me into this movie, but just avoid it, and get a different movie. I gave it more than 1 star, because it does have some good parts in it, but the bad parts far outweigh those."
1,Horrible,"I was very disappointed in this movie. The overall concept could be cute for children but they took it too far. I am a huge fan of the movie ""Annie."" There are some similarities but they took the cruelty of the foster mother to another level that is not enjoyable to watch. Burning children's toys took it too far. Disney really missed the mark on this one."
2,Can't believe this was rated G - sure scared my 5 year old,I wish I would have read the other reviews here before my 5 year old daughter settled in to watch this movie. She had enough after Santa was hit by the car and robbed and Santa Paws got lost. I thought - it has to get better. Luckily she thought differently and said she would rather go to bed than watch anymore. After she was asleep I watched the rest and gosh...I'm glad she didn't see it...The dog and child in the incinerator would have been absolutely horrifying for her. I liked the sets at the North Pole and the Toy Shoppe but otherwise definately not for a little kid.
5,Great Movie,This is a great family movie for you and your kids to enjoy. It talks about the true meaning of Christmas in a unique and fun way with puppies. We appreciated the bond between Paws and Santa Claus.
1,DISTURBING HOLIDAY MOVIE. DON'T DO IT!!!,"Disney should be ashamed. This is the worst holiday movie you could ever have a child watch. While I could give many examples, here are three that will hopefully be enough to steer you away from this movie:1) A girl's parents die and Social Services has to find a place for her to live.2) The caregiver to which she is assigned is hideously mean and does not allow the children to play with toys or to put up any decorations for Christmas; if she catches any of the children in her home playing with toys, the toys are immediately put in an incinerator and burned (and the children can hear the incinerator being activated).3) Santa almost dies and has to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.There are so many good holiday movies that have redeeming value and a wonderful message to share. Please don't risk traumatizing your child with this movie.P.S. I thought this DVD was part of the wonderful ""Buddies"" movie series, but it's not."
4,Disney movie,"I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She really enjoyed the snow buddies, space buddies movies and last years Santa Paws movie. This one did not have the buddies and did not hold her attention as well as the buddies movies. I really enjoyed it myself. It was very cute."
1,Scared child,I thought to buy this for my two children ages 14 and 7 for a Thanksgiving weekend movie. The movie is not appropriate for those that believe in Santa. A line in the movie leads my 7 year old to think Santa is going to die and I have to comfort her to tell her ok. However the worst to me is Disney's choice to use an incinerator to show punishment and the doll burned. This image was what was put into my daughters mind and when the dog and the little girl went into the incinerator she went hysterical thinking they were going to burn to death. This is the image that Disney chose to present verses maybe a garbage bin and truck or something. My child did not even know an incinerator and is now scared of it. Though this movie showed true Christmas spirit it was lost to my child in the horrifying events.
2,Not what it appears,"I felt awful when I got this movie for the kids. If you look at the picture you would never think that it was such a dark story. Yes, there is a happy ending, I knew there would be, it is Disney after all so I MADE my children watch to the end. Now they enjoy the movie but I wouldn't put them through that first time again for anything."
2,Not my favorite but the kids liked it,"This movie was in my opinion a cheesy knockoff of ""Annie"". The acting was lousy, the story line left much to be desired and it was much too dark for a feel-good Christmas movie. That being said, my kids really like it, they have watched it many times already and we've only owned it for a few days. They did have many questions and felt sadness in the events in the movie but still loved the songs and the happy ending. If my kids (8 and 5) could review this, I am pretty sure they would give it 5 stars."
3,My kids liked it.,"We bought this movie because my kids LOVE Santa Buddies and any other movie with singing and animals in it. There were a few moments that my 4 year old and my 9 year old were a bit worried, and didn't want to see what was happening when the drama was building, but every other moment of the movie they loved. I would categorize them as a bit sensitive compared to many kids so if your kids can sit through any kids movie with a plot, they should be fine. There is the typical Disney villain in this flick. I agree with others that there were some similarities to Annie, but also Mr. Magorium's Magic Emporium as well.There were many good messages in the story, and all the kids acting in the movie did a great job. The dogs all had fun personalities which amused the kids AND the small group of adults we had watching the movie."
1,"Terrible movie, very dark!","I purchased this movie for my three children over the weekend. Even my 11 year old thought this movie was sad and scary, let alone my 2 other younger children. Avoid at all costs! Wish I could return it!"
1,Adding another thumbs down review.,"I'm not sure what audience this film is supposed to target. I agree with all the other reviews that this movie is far too dark for young children. The caretaker of the kids in this film makes the one in ""Annie"" look like Mary Poppins, and the furnace scenes border on sadistic. The rest of the film is just cliched and corny."
2,Glad I'm not alone.. thinking this was a bit too much..,"My kids were very upset watching this movie also. My 8 eight cried real tears, while my 5 year old whimpered. My biggest conflict with this movie is we are friends with one of the children in the movie. My children got a kick out of watching the movie that has one of their friends in it. So while they were frightened at times, they have watched the movie a couple times because of that, and at least know now the movie ends ok and everybody is going to be ok. --if it were not for the friend, I would probably have deposited the movie in the trash though because of my kids initial fears.."
1,WORST HOLIDAY MOVIE EVER - EXPECT TEARS AND NIGHTMARES.,"Seriously. What lunatic thought this movie was a good idea?My kids are not super sensitive. But really what kid wants to watch Santa get hit by a car, mugged, and end up with a head injury?And what kid wants to see a kid in a foster home get her only toy thrown into an incinerator? Which we get to watch by the way as the doll dramatically catches fire?I don't know what happened after that because I turned it off.STAY AWAY!!!!"
2,Far Too Intense for Tykes,"Our boy, who'll be 9 at the end of January, was able to handle this movie, but those parents who've said that it was too dark are absolutely correct. This film is far too intense for small kids. Sure, everything turns out well in the end, and some bad things have lessons behind them (take care of your toys and love them, because some kids don't have them), but all this cou;d've been achieved without too much tyke trauma. Toys burned, Paws turning into a stuffed animal about to be burned, Santa hit by a car, Santa in the hospital about to die, Paws maybe staying a stuffed dog forever to save Santa.This is too much for the kindergarten and under crowd: above that, take it year by year. Visually, it is a treat, there are some things which kids will love here, but who needs angst for tots for Christmas?Parents should screen this movie first."
3,Great storyline,"While I understand why others would negatively review this, there is a great storyline within this movie. My older son really enjoyed this movie, while my younger daughter enjoyed the musical sets. I myself thought it was cute, and hoped for a home for the girls. Santa does get hit by a cab, and mugged, and the girls are treated awful in the orphanage. But, this movie is about believing in Christmas, and I feel it's a good movie to sit and watch with a family. You can look at the bad parts but really the moral of the story is the best part. Everyone has their own opinions:)"
4,Holiday Favorites,"My kids love this show! It's about their favorite holiday, and favorite animal. They want to watch over and over!!"
4,Great family movie!,"I have to say, owning a Bichon Frise that looks like the guy on the cover is the only reason we got The Search for Santa Paws... but we fell in love with the movie when we watched it! It's a cute story that you can sit your children in front of and not worry about them. They'll stay right there until it ends and then they want to see it again (my daughter did!)."
1,Terrible movie,"My daughter loved the first movie so I was excited when this came out. She made it to the scene where the dog is thrown in the fire and then burst into tears, I've never seen her ever cry so hard. I tried explaining to her it was a toy puppy but she kept insisting that it had just been a real puppy and she thought the puppy was burning. It's been weeks since she's seen it and even now if you mention the name of the movie tears start welling up in her eyes and she'll tell you how a dog was burning in it.I would not recommend this movie to anyone and I'm disgusted that Disney would release such a movie. And the movie is rated G, you should not have to pre-screen a G movie when the whole purpose of the G rating is that it is suitable for everyone."
1,Terrible for Small Children,"I have 2 daughters. We made it about 20 minutes and it had to be turned off, sadly. We have seen the first ""Santa Buddies"" about 50 times, so we were excited for this one, but were very Dissapointed. This is NOT a movie for little kids, it is very scary to children and is not your normal warm-happy-holiday movie. It seems to be geared more for ages 10+. As for us we will just keep watching the 2009 Santa Buddies."
1,Awful,"I don't think I have ever gotten online to write a review of anything but this movie is so bad that I couldn't stop myself. Watched it with my 13 year old and was so thankful my 8 and 6 years olds were not around to see it. My kids and I have seen all of the other 'buddy' movies and enjoyed them. This one is completely dark, scary and not fun in any way. I threw it out after we watched it! Don't waste your money!"
1,"Be Careful, Not for small children","I just wanted to add to the choir. This movie is not for younger children. It is way to scary. The other reviews said it well. Santa almost dies twice. Santa Paws is nearly incenerated but the young orphan girl climbs onto the incenerator conveyor belt and they both nearly die. Merry Christmas. Lots of talk about my parents live in heaven now and I don't have anyone to take care of me. Youch! My child was sobbing about the possibility of losing us, who would be there for them, what if Santa dies to? Thank you Disney. The only good thing about this family movie night was that it was a rental and it didn't get put under the Christmas tree."
5,Well worth reading,"A meticulously researched, extremely important (although painful to read) book. I highly recommend it."
2,Naive,"The problem with his argument is that he makes generalized motives the norm after researching a few examples. It's naive to go with the premise of White workers and Black slaves going against the power structure, united we stand, etc. by itself. Historically, there are financial motives that were far stronger than ""brothers in bondage"" motives. The companies in the north were being bested by their southern brethren. The north could not use slaves and suffered financially, therefore created a general sympathy for the slave movement. The humanitarian issue did not come until much later, generally. For those that were always humanitarians, the John Browns, etc. They were the minority of Whites in the north, not the majority. The correlation might as well not even exist."
4,If you like Mina,"An Italian Diva of the highest standard. If you are a fan of divas and lounge music, you should be listening to Mina. No matter if you know the Italian or not, you'll enjoy this mood inducing disc. With her strong vocals and lush orchestrations, this record works as background music or something you want to hum along. Recommended for Sunday mornings."
3,Great Graphics and Fast Game Play,"Overall, I am dissapointed by Quake3. However, there are now many modificatinos (Mods) available that make it a far more interesting game when playing over the internet. Plus, a new mission pack will be released in Nov. 2000 that will add new maps, weapons and features. I still prefer Unreal Tournament to Q3. But if your looking for some great graphics and really fast game play (assuming your computer can handle it), then I strongly recommend this title be added to any serious ""first person shooter's"" library."
2,Quake3? UT,"This is just a souped up Quake1. I for one don't know how ID makes a living selling the same game so many times. It has cool graphics, but the gameplay is very subpar. Compared to it's competitor, Unreal Tournament, Quake3 is miles behind. I was looking forward to q3 since q2, but when I finally got the first ""test"" I was very disappointed. I heard of Unreal Tournament and downloaded the demo, and now I am addicted. If it's demo with only 6 levels can get me so hooked, imagine what... well you get the idea. Unreal Tournament CLEARLY outdoes Quake3."
2,Not up to Par,"All in All, I don't see what the big fuss was about. Don't get me wrong, Q3 is a great game, but i think Half-Life beats it hands down with TFC and CS. Q3 IS just a souped up version of Q2, and Quake can get really old after weeks of playing. :P And on a final note, I just couldn't get into Q3 as much as I did Q2 because the levels weren't as real. It was too ""cartoonish""."
3,From Back Cover,"Joan Benetti has made a vow. No more men. Instead she needs to focus on making a success of her business-a bookstore specializing in erotic literature. If only the steamy passages in the books didn't leave her longing for a man's touch...So when sexy millionaire Bryce Worthington asks her out, she can't resist. And when they end up in his hotel room...well, a girl can take only so much. With the sizzling scenes from the books stoking her imagination...and Bruce's heated looks firing her body...suddenly it's-vow? What vow?""[Follow-up to Silent Confessions]"
2,Not The Mouse,"Alright, this album does not do a good job at all making the original intruments to a bluegrass rythem. Plus, it is not Issac Brock singing! Also, the lyrics were changed pretty heavy. I have not listened to the other blugrass tribute, but I hope it is better than this. Even Green Days blugrass tribute was better!"
4,A hit!,We deployed this Bubble Gum Cigar Box on the birth of our baby girl venue and it just run out.
5,Fun way to celebrate my daughter's arrival,I bought a box of these a couple weeks before my baby girl's due date. They are fun to hand out at work or when people come to visit. And the gum itself is actually quite good!
1,Just another chinese watch brand.,"Beware !!! Sturhling, Swiss Legend or Stauer ... beware folks. These brand names may sound so europeen to deceive the consumers. Check their website, there is no manufacturor's address in Switzerland or Germany, the origin is very obscure. This watch may look flashy in the picture but in reality is a very low quality watch. I have only seen this brand name appear recently, nothing to do with ""art and tradition of Swiss making watch"" or "" Swiss legend"" or "" made in Germany"" or the like."
2,Limited use becuase it quit after 2 months,"Certainly not as expected. Given to another person as a gift , now have no info and a dead watch. This no way to advance my friendship with this person. I don't know where to send it or if I am just out of luck."
1,I was bored stiff by this book,"I was so bored by this book I had to force myself to finish it, and probably won't attempt another Elizabeth Lowell book, as this was my first. The story is so obvious, there were no surprises for me, and the bedroom scenes were nothing of note either. Obviously I'm in the minority here, as so many reviewers rate this book so highly, but I don't even think it deserves one star. That's just the lowest I can go on this system."
5,I loved this book!,This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I love Dominic to death. Elizabeth Lowell gives such a great description of her characters that I couldn't help but fall in love. I hope Ms. Lowell will write more about her wonderful characters.
2,Tedious,"If I had to hear ""my little falcon"" one more time.... And there was no real reason why she didn't tell him about her attack. Story was extremely thin and slow."
3,a little disappointed.......maybe a spoiler involved,"Elizabeth Lowell is one of my long time favorites; but I was a little disappointed with this book. Unlike another reviewer; I found Garwood's mediveal books better than this one. I don't feel like I wasted my time reading this book but 3 stars are max. I thought the Hero was cold and distant. He had more ""feelings"" for his brother than his heroine. Actually, I like his brother and the ""enemy"" Duncan better than this hero. This hero's constant public accusations of his bride's moral character were demeaning. Especially since he made a disrespectful ""pass"" at whom he thought was a young maid 2 days before his ""marriage"". Talk about morals? I care more for Ms. Garwood's style in the way her Heros treat their heroines..... with respect and a little humor. After all this, Ms. Lowell is still on my ""favorites"" list."
4,Enjoyable,"This book was quite an enjoyable read because it was very true to many of the things that happened during the close of the Crusades. Lots of land were awarded to the faithful and sons were considered of utmost importance, even though the only true way to trace lineage is through the maternal bloodlines. Looking forward to reading her other medieval period models."
5,Excellent,The book was great. I loved it. The story of Dominic and Meg will always delight me. Elizabeth Lowell is a great writer.
5,Fantastic and Magical Medieval Romance,"This is the first book in this medieval trilogy which is quite enchanting. The mystical maiden falls in love with the battle hardened warrior who had never known love. The plot is pretty typical from there, but the details are what make this story."
4,good for a compiled disc from 4 movie soundtracks.,the record is good if you enjoyed the four beatle movies I've had the LP for years and still enjoy it now my kids like it just as much as I do
5,Tone poetry that soothes the soul,"This, and it's companion CD, ""There's No Place Like Om (Vol 1)"", are the only CD's I listen to on a daily basis. Remeniscent to me of such landmark work as ""Paul Horn: Inside the TajMahal"" and ""Wendy Carlos: Sonic Seasonings"", ""There's No Place Like Om"" is a timeless work of musical skill and insight.The intermingling of musical instruments and nature sounds somehow taps into our body's own internal vibrations, and allows for a soothing relaxation, while taking the mind on a gentle journey. It is my musical choice at night when my mind is racing with the internal chatter of the day. This music, this tone poetry, is like a sonic tonic to quiet the mind and soothe the soul."
5,Relaxing and Invigorating,"I have been meaning to review this c.d. for a couple of weeks since I first got it. A friend recommended this c.d. to me so I purchased it and I definitely am SUPER glad that I did.I put this c.d. on and INSTANTLY I felt more centered, relaxed and peaceful. I actually had the volume up quite loudly and I could feel the vibrations and the ""center"" of the music. It was like I was floating. It instantly relaxed me.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something that is relaxing who doesn't like ""frog"" sounds or ""thunder"" storms. This is truly inspired by science and works. It will truly re-center you and give you ""new life.""I rate 5 stars out of 5!I can't wait to buy the tuning forks to go with this! :)"
4,Great Upgrade,"I am not sure why some people had trouble with this version. I haven't run across any bugs or problems of any kind. maybe other people hadn't applied the updater or maybe their computer wasn't up to the challenge or maybe I just don't do the same things they do but my experience has been troublefree. I use the program in conjunction with Coldfusion MX 7(also by Macromedia) and the integration work well, too. Maybe if people that talk it down could be more specific rather than just saying ""it's buggy"" I could test out their issues and see if I can duplicate their problems"
1,I suspect fraud,The package arrived with the OEM User Guide. The apparent OEM CD did not have any files on it. The CD was blank.
1,Not a happy camper,"I was very excited that I purchased Dreamweaver MX; Unfortunately, when my software arrived, it was broken. The CD had been mailed in a padded envelope, period. The person had not taken measures to ensure that the CD would not break. The CD was not sandwiched between sturdy cardboard to prevent the CD from breaking. Even though Amazon was wonderful in refunding my money in a timely way, I nevertheless did not get the software I wanted. I will not order from Amazon again."
1,Unusable on Macs,"The Mac version of this program is TERRIBLE. It takes 3-10 seconds for each keystroke or command to appear on the screen, and I have a fast dual-processor G4 PowerMac. I'm amazed that this thing made it to the shelves in its current condition. And this is even AFTER applying the patch that's supposed to correct the slowness. I've been seeing reports this all over the net - dont buy this for Mac, as it's just about unusable."
1,buggy to the nth,"Having previously used Dreamweaver Version 4 to maintain a five- year old website, I finally bit the bullet and updated to Dreamweaver MX 2004.The updated interface is a nice touch, but overall the program is bloated as though the designers were trying to think of things to add.This program's greatest failing, however, is that it is the ""buggiest"" softeware I have ever used. Even with the update, it crashes virtually every time I use it forcing me to close and then start over. If you use this softeware, save your work constantly (always good advice regardless).I anticipated that this software would give me a lot of bang for the buck. All I got was a chance to spend a lot of bucks."
2,Performance on the MAC platform is SLOW and CLUNKY,Performance on the MAC platform is SLOW and CLUNKY. This new version has nice improvements over the previous version but the performance issues make the workflow annoying rather than enjoyable. I would wait until Macromedia releases an upgrade for this version before getting it. Believe me I've been a Dreamweaver user for many versions now.
1,Upgrade? What upgrade? Just problems,"Upgrade? What upgrade? The older versions were much better than this one. This new version runs very slowly, adds redundant and unneeded tags and crashes more often than Windows 98!Please just don't buy this product, don't waste your money."
2,"Looks VERY NICE, if you have a fast computer","- SLOW - compared to MX, many new features such as showing width/height size of pictures/tables when you click on them, but this made it hard to make simple edits. I'm running on an Athlon XP 2000, it should be a decent CPU for a HTML editor.- UNSTABLE - This has to be the biggest flaw of this software. Now I'm use to saving after every change because of how unstable it is. I get the annoying ""Windows cannot recover Dreamweaver"" and it crashes out.- OVERALL - NICE, if it worked the way it's suppose to. I would NOT recommend it to other buyers. I wish I can get my money back =(."
4,Buggy but useful,"I was using HomeSite long before Macromedia purchased it, but didn't try Dreamweaver until earlier this year, when I downloaded the trial.Those who claim Dreamweaver is crash-prone are correct; I see the most crashes in mixed-mode, but the crashes are generally avoidable once you learn to work around them.I'm relatively new to CSS, PHP and MySQL, and DreamWeaver has eased my learning curve for these. That alone has been worth the purchase price. I also appreciate DW's extensibility, and the helpfulness of the DW Community.At root, DW is just another text editor, and is friendlier to the coder than the visually inclined. If you're the latter, you may prefer Adobe GoLive. For me, it's a step closer to visual web development from HomeSite, which I still use and enjoy."
2,Two words - slow and crash,"I thought it was just me but I see others have the same problem. I usually end up using the earlier version of DW because I just can't take the slowness. And it crashes - not a lot - but the fact that it crashes at all is bothersome. At work I have a workstation and I rarely, and I mean RARELY, crash. With Dreamweaver MX I crash at least once a day!"
2,SLOW... period,"I'm sorry.. they get 2 stars for new features and better use of screen realestate.. but every funtion on the mac is DRAMATICALLLLLY slowed down even vs MX version or 4... I've been using DW (& the suite) since v1 & was even on the beta test team... they STILL have not worked out bugs I repored in V3 & this is by far the slowest version yet... totally unusable for any real work.. (& I run a out g4 iMac/512..On the PC it does appear to run quite faster... poor that they seemed to drop the ball here.And the price.. cmon give as a break..these prices are unreal for most users to consider yearly upgrades.. especially with very little changes.. they have been rushing since v3 to just deliver product before it was ready... They can make good software, but I'd wish they would only release software when it was ready."
1,A disaster released before its time,"I've used all previous versions of Dreamweaver, but this version simply sucks in terms of speed, no matter what I am attempting to do. It takes me back to the days of the floppy shuffle. I'm running it on a 1.25ghz machine with 1Gb of RAM. Everything else I use runs fine.Support is nil. Not one of my requests for help has ever been replied to. One bonus is I have been forced to do much more hand-coding and I am loving it."
5,I Am The Bullgod/Cowboy,This is a great single it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. if you have not listened to this single then i recommend you do
2,Not what it should be,Bought this one and like other reviewers have written it will not crush the bigger vitamin and calcium pills. You have to break them into 4 pieces and then it does pretty well. I have bought three different kinds in search of the best one and this isnt it. The blue and clear plastic Apex is the best so far because of its design. It crushes the pills this one doesnt.
3,"Not bad, but not good either.","This crusher does a good job on small to medium size pills, but has problems with large or very hard pills. There is little grip area on the cap, so it can be difficult to exert enough pressure with your hands, especially if you have arthritis. We go through 2 or 3 of these a year because they eventually crack or become too difficult to turn. The plastic cap on the pill container end is always the first to go. Looking for a better solution."
4,Great item,"Great item, but will not crush all pills. I use it for my smaller pills but for the larger pills it do not do very well. The grips start to ware."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"I bought this crusher because the picture on Amazon showed it as a smooth pill crusher without grooves. When it arrived, I saw that the picture on the box also showed a smooth crusher. However, when I opened the product I found jagged grooves on the holder and crusher. I promptly returned it without using it because I have used crushers like this before and they do not crush the pill entirely. I am requesting a refund."
1,Poor Product,Sorry but this product does not meet the standards. Does NOT work. Brief and to the point.
3,good basics for a newbie,"Having not fenced since my college days in the 60s, but still having a set of foils and masques, I wanted to obtain a book to remind me of what I once knew...the basicsWhile there were a few defensive moves not discussed in this book, nor a discussion of the advantages/disadvantages of various grips, I found the book helpful and believe a newbie would benefit from its illustrations."
1,Way too basic!,"If you are looking for a super basic book on fencing with 75% of the content being exercises and little workout routines, this is the book for you. If you are looking for something with ANY depth on the subject look anywhere but here. I returned this book on principle I was so dissapointed with it."
4,A good book on fencing,"This is one of the best books on fencing writen by an American. It's major weakness is that it often attempts to teach both foil and epee and the same time . The author does address modern fencing , a subject often ingored. This book is good for the person that knows how to fence and wants some pointers; not a good read for beginners . A good book but kept me wanting more, for example the author tells nothing of how she took up the sport and what it's done for her. Close only 4 of 5 stars."
5,best instructional book out there for beginners,"breaks down each move and explains exactly what each part of the body should (and should not) be doing, how your weight should be distributed, etc. also lists common mistakes made and how to avoid or fix them. best of all, it's filled with tons of drills for practice, both solo and with a partner. working my way through the book has gotten me through my first semester of fencing with excellent results. so much more helpful than any other book out there, by far."
2,booooooring,"If you want to see the same guys talking from their couches with a drum sets in the background, then these videos are for you! To say I learned nothing about Led Zep would be untrue, but the band footage is limited and is re-used throughout the three videos.These are in no way concert videos, they are interviews mostly, and with people that know tons about the band, but aren't really anyone I've ever heard of. Some dude named ""Krusher"" appears on two of the DVD's, he's a very funny album and song reviewer but mostly he's an old hippie........."
2,disappointing,"The book doesn't do justice to its author. There's little to really sink your teeth into. Svejda's Foreward says: ""If it weren't for Kaufman, the best-known cue in the history of film music - Tara's Theme from Gone with the Wind - would not have been heard so expressively, but that's another story and one far better told by the violinist himself.""But ""the violinist himself"" hardly tells the story at all! ""One Sunday morning, Max [Steiner] called unexpectedly. ""Louis, are you free today?"" ""Yes, Max."" ""Come right over with your violin. I have some themes to submit to Selznick for Gone with the Wind. He wants to hear them. It's not very interesting with just piano."" Annette and I drove to Max's home, where he had set up a small recording machine. Max and I tried out and played over the themes for Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Tara, etc. Selznick enthusiastically approved these samples.""Jim Svejda couldn't tell that story?Disappointing."
1,Not true Socket 478,Not until taking out my mobo and lining up the new retention bracket did I figure out that it would not work with socket 478. This bracket looks almost square and my socket 478 is more rectangular. maybe its me.
3,Omens,Book in perfect condition most likely because it was a literary bomb and the first buyer didn't read it either.
3,Warm killings,"The big killing is a book full of killing. Full of spectacular killings, somewhat too much in my opinion. It is very well written. You Get a feeling of beeing in Western Africa. You can smell all the smells from rubbish and feel all the warm nights. You read about the heavy rain as if you sit in the car together with Bruce. I like the book and will read the other books from Africa as well."
2,Not Impressed.,"I have heard and read much acclaim of Robert Wilson's novels, but ""The Big Killing"" left me unimpressed. The African atmosphere made a good starting point, but the story is pieced together haphazardly with characters floating into and out of the narrative without realistic explanation or credibility. At the novel's conclusion, I was left with more questions than answers. Wilson clearly possesses the story-telling tools; he simply needs to work on his plot development and characterizations. ""The Big Killing"" isn't bad, just disjointed. A little more time at the re-write desk would have helped!"
2,Looks way better than it tastes.,"I bought a can of these nicely wrapped, Kosher certified sardines for a much lower price than I usually pay for sardines and with an expiration date over four and a half years in the future. I opened the can and saw four neatly packed silver sardines. I thought ""Wow, this looks like a good deal"".So imagine my surprise when I pulled out these mushy oil-logged sardines with all the meat a uniform shade of very pale green instead of the firm beige and pink meaty goodness that I've grown accustomed to with other premium brands. Even a squirt of lime juice couldn't save them. I made it through the can just because I don't like to waste food, but I'll never buy these again.So heads up, try a can before you buy in bulk and see if this is the sardine for you."
3,It's okay at best,"I bought it to hopefully keep birds away form garden. As long as iI move it every day, it generally does a decent job."
4,Good Enough,"The material this is made out of is not the highest quality of flag material (idk, are they silk?), but for the price I can't complain. The stars, stripes, and colors were spot on."
5,Good for the price,I love my Chicago flag. It's pretty big and looks great hanging in my dorm. The stars resemble the Star of David rather than the true six-point star but it's a minor detail.It's a great reminder of home and I can't wait to go back to my city.
2,Chicago flag,I was disappointed with the Chicago Flag. I expected a nicer flag and was surprised that is was like a stamped flag. I was hoping to get a flag that was sewn so the quality wasn't there. I didn't remember that the flag was polyester. I was just excited to finally find a Chicago flag. I should have expected that it wasn't a quality flag because of the low price. I plan on getting the fabric in the colors I need and just make my own.
1,Crooked,This flag was crooked and the stars more closely resembled the stars of david than the more pointed chicago stars.
5,3'x5' is the same size every where except in my head,Can these be ironed? Looks great and is much bigger than I imagined. Now I know how my prom date felt.
1,Way over-written,"Magneto wants to make a safe haven for all mutants, that haven turns out to be New Yok City,then the X-Men have to fight both the Master of Magentism and human bigots to save the city from total destruction. Like we haven't seen this in the comics a million times before, only here the story was over 200 pages long and all of it was a complete ""been there, done that"" story all over again."
5,A must read for anyone that has ever heard of the X-Men,"'The idea of the team being split up is so over done' thats what I thought when I started this trilogy, along with, 'I don't think that the X-Men in space is a good idea' and 'haven't we heard enough out of Magneto all ready?'. Well after I was through with the first book I was begging for the second! And this book is certainly as high quality as the first. The way he analyses the characters and their personalities is absolutely spectacular! I thought that I would die when I finished this book, the anticipation for the third has gotten me to read the first two again!I tip my hat Christopher Golden on his stunning accomplishments!"
4,"The ""Two Towers"" of this trilogy...","Don't get me wrong, this is still a good book, but it seems more ""filler"" than not. Just like the ""Two Towers"" this isn't the beginning or the end, it is just....there. I agree with most that the space subplot is pretty boring. It seems more like and excuse to keep them out of picture until book three. Wouldn't want Magneto to lose TOO quickly after all. Besides, does anyone write a series to JUST be two books, or is it always at LEAST a trilogy? Anyways, this is good readin', and any X-Men fan will enjoy it. If you're keeping score....1) X-Men: Mutant Empire (series); Christopher Golden2) Daredevil: Predator's Smile; Christopher Golden3) Hulk: What Savage Beast; Peter David4) Fantastic Four: To Free Atlantis; Nancy A. Collins5) Ultimate Spider-Man; Stan Lee, editor6) Spider-Man: Carnage in New York; David Michelinie & Dean Wesley Smith"
2,supplies index,"Needs a much more comprehensive explanation of tools and where to get them. More artists in this media would be of great interest. Make more jewelry techniques available please. This is ok for a beginning, but the tin can is relatively a new idea and a book with much more coverage and artists is sorely needed."
5,Great ideas.....,I have been scrapbooking for years and at times feel that I keep doing the same things over and over. This book has provided me with some great new ideas that I hadn't thought of. It is a book that I suggest to new scrapbookers and veterans alike.
4,Some super ideas for using your photos to their best!,This is a great book for ideas. Reading through its pages really gave me some great ideas for using several rolls of film I'd taken of a long weekend trip. The ideas for cropping your pictures are innovative and unique. I found my creative juices really flowing after reading this book. Highly recommended. See also: Memory makers Embellishments!
3,Definitely not for beginners,"While I enjoyed looking through this book for the ideas, I found that most of the techniques were very advanced - particularly cutting out images with a craft knife. While anyone CAN do that, it takes alot of practice to be able to make such clean-looking cuts.Many beautiful pages and unique ideas, but not for a beginning scrapbooker such as myself."
3,Illustrations Sweeten Better Than Chocolate,This is my second e-book that I have read. The material is nicely packaged and there is a good bibliography at the end. I Iove the illustrations.
5,Best bet for the price!,"This rice cooker is fast and easy. It is the first I have ever owned, so I do not understand what possible features other cookers at 3-4 times the price could have to justify the money. Go with this one."
1,Not good...,"I bought this cooker about 4 months ago when I saw some review as 'go ahead & buy this if you need a no-nonsense, reliable non-stick rice cooker....'. What a misleading review! This cooker is very sticky comparing to other rice cookers I used. I don't like it at all and now it stays in the corner."
2,Not Happy,"To be fair, this rice cooker makes decent rice. That's all it does. There's no timer. The switch is awkward to use (it's hard to tell whether it's on ""cook"" or ""warm"" and I've made the mistake of setting it wrong and not cooking my rice). Worst of all, there's no beep or ding or anything except the snap of the switch changing from ""cook"" to ""warm"" to let you know when the rice is done.If budget is your overriding constraint, fine, buy this machine. But if you're looking for convenience in the kitchen keep looking until you find one with a few more features. That's what I'm about to do."
2,Very disappointed with this little Cooker,Bought this little Rice Cooker as a cheap alternative Cooker for my Father. He used it twice and hated it so much that it went back into the Box and was put in storage.The reason he disliked this Cooker so much is because the Rice didn't cook right and it was very dry. Even when we put more Water it still didn't cook properly.... For Panasonic I must say I am very disappointed. We use to have a Rice Cooker many years ago in the 1970's made by the Panasonic Corp. and it worked great... Now I will just stick with Zojirushi Rice Cookers..
1,horrendous Beethoven,"It's for sure the worst performance of these two great concerts I have ever heard. It applies not only to the performances, but also to the sound, that is quite poor. If you want a really good recording of these concertos, get the Kempff, Arrau or Pollini versions."
1,Overwhelming Odor,"Ordered this item and it arrived promptly, was as shown. However, the steering wheel cover had such a strong smell (like gasoline or petroleum) that it was impossible to use. Stored it in the car overnight and the entire vehicle now reeks of gas and we can't get the smell out days later, even after taking the cover out of the car. Amazon processed the return wonderfully and there were no other problems with the item. If you're sensitive to smells, this isn't the wheel cover for you."
2,Does have an oil smell and is loose on my steering wheel,Many people talk about it having a smell & it does!!! It smells straight up like a used oil and does stink my whole car up overnight.. isn't tight on my steering wheel either
4,tight fit,it feels pretty good and fits snugly. at first was worried it was too small but it just takes a little force
1,Strong chemical odor unbearable,"The product has very strong odor, you can't wash it off from your hands with soap and water just doing it once. The whole car is full of the smell of vinil or whatever it made of. Make my wife and kids throw up. Walking into Wal-mart, you will find product with thicker padded soft material and odorless, no need to drive with all windows down."
4,"Love it, but not the smell","The cover is great, it really hides the missing fabric in my steering wheel(makes it look nice~) and even feels good when you touch it. My only complaint is when it gets to warm a plasticish leather smell fills my car, and its just not a fun smell to get on your hands and breath in. I usually let my car vent for a few seconds and its gone. Other than that, very pleased."
4,Long overdue book,"Hot Wheels were a major pastime for me growing up and I'm surprised this book didn't appear sooner. The wealth of information and anecdotes on how this toy came to be made the book very entertaining to read. While quite knowledgeable about his subject, the author made a number of factual errors regarding automotive history (I work in the industry) and was vague about some of the actual dates during the first few years of Hot Wheels production. Still, the good photography and artwork have made this one of my favorite books!"
4,Pretty good,"The taste of the product was pretty good it did taste like white chocolate but it tasted a bit more like that vanilla almond bark stuff it sometimes left a weird coating like feeling in my mouth. But overall for 5 net carbs the taste was really good. I've ordered the milk chocolate ones to try next. Mine were packed in an insulated bag with a reusable freezer pack so they weren't melted when they arrived but I put them in the freezer to make them firmer. I also had no stomach problems with one bar. I guess it just depends on how sensitive a person it to the malitol. I'd recommend this product for anyone watching their carbs or sugar intake. The bars were bigger and in my opinion more satisfying then those Atkins bars they sell in the store, but that's just my opinion, I haven't tried too many of the Atkins bars. But for the time being I prefer these to the ones I have tried."
5,Delicious white chocolate,"I love white chocolate, and am diabetic. I don't have a problem with malitol raising my blood sugar. I love these bars. My daughter ate one and didn't even know it was sugar free. It tastes just like regular white chocolate with sugar. I recommend any of the Ross chocolate's, whatever flavor you are fond of you will like them if the malitol doesn't bother you!"
3,"interesting book, but not what the title implies...","I eagerly looked forward to this book after reading a review in the local paper. However, the title is very misleading. Although it is well done for what it is, it is not a book (right brain) about how to see, but rather is a (left brain) book about the rather interesting details of the object that you are seeing ...like what automobile forces have created the irregularities in pavement, or what the anatomy is behind a chest x-ray, or the geologic history of grains of sand... interesting, but not really a book about the process of seeing, and how to actually see objects. You may actually enjoy this book if you are interested in unusual facts and details about the world, but its not a book about the process of awakening your awareness..."
5,eyeball haiku,Cousin loves to look/ the Big Camera is hers/ She wants to see -- moreThis book helps with that. Don't hold back.
5,Well done,"This is a great accessory for any IRiver Clix it fits perfectly and works flawlessly. It perfect fit has cutouts or raise-ups for all buttons and switches that match up exactly, stops the clix from rattling when jogging (anyone who doesn't own a clix the rattling has nothing to do with any flaws in the clix it's just because the entire front of it has to be able to move) the silicon skin allows it to function normally and removes the rattle while protecting the prestine finish of the Clix"
3,craft table,over all this table will work just fine for our daughter the only problem I had was I got 2 of the same sided up rights and had to drill a couple hole where the table tilts but other than that it went together fine
2,bad packaging and a cheap top,"The frame for this table is alright, but the top is not sturdy and the way it is shipped, it came with dented corners and buckled edges. the plastic trays are kind of silly, not very useful. It is a little awkward to put together, and the screw to put the brush holder on are the wrong type. Over all, a big disappointment. save the 30 bucks for shipping to get something locally."
3,Could use some more quality,"1) Surface hinges are pretty flimsy. Lean on the top - bend2) Assembly instructions were horrible. Not well detailed.3) Should have checked sale price at A.C Moore.4) Screw holes on surface to hold side utility trays aren't accurate, I couldn't fit one of the trays.5) Metal utility 'holders' on the side are hard to reach. Too out of the way.6) Horizontal support bars should be more substatnial - they make convenient foot rests and are somewhat flimsy"
3,disappointing surface,"For my needs this is a great table. However, if I was more serious about art; I would want to be warned about the following two things...1. The surface of the table is not smooth. The table is finished in some sort of fake oak veneer and there's a noticeable grain to the wood. This grain would definitely telegraph through fine materials and light papers.2. You do not have fine control over the tilt of the table. The surface lifts on a pair of hinged brackets that have six or eight registration points. If you don't like those, you're out of luck.Again, for me the table is ideal. I really like the width in particular. However, for more serious artists I would recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Poor quality,"When I saw this item, I was so excited! It could hold all my flatware and was beautiful or so I thought. I ordered this twice and both times I had major issues with it. The first time, the drawer was difficult to use (could not pull out without major force) and the side pieces were not attached. You could see the glue that had been used dried off. The second time I ordered this, the drawer was okay, but there was a knick right in front and again the side pieces were not glued together. If you have patience to buy, cross your fingers, wait and see, go for it. Since I wanted a piece like this that I could have for at least a few years, I finally asked for a refund."
5,Respect the arcitect RAKIM IS GOD,"Rakim ALLAH is the greatest gift hip hop has ever received,I mean think about it,if there were no 'R' There would be no 'NAS'.He paved the way for prolific writters in the hip hop world.If you dont respect the 'R' you dont respect hip hop- ya heard...peace to the gods."
5,Young Jeezy Sucks,"I read that guys review saying this CD is gay and he says Jeezy is better, Jeezy sounds worse than me taking a s*it! Southern rap is probably one of the worst forms of hip hop now adays. Rakim is probably one of the best rappers ever, he stays focused and he could kill anyone in a battle rap. His albums have been great, going back to the days when he was with Eric B. The beats are hard and his rhymes are perfect, every song on here is awesome. Also, the only reason why Jeezy got famous was because MTV (the gayest channel on earth) played his videos over and over again. If you like this, you'd also like the Wu Tang Clan."
4,Dope record,"What can I say? Many people label Rakim the greatest rapper of all time, but I'm sure about one thing. He ain't. What the hell did Rakim contribute to the history of hip-hop? Not a godamn thing if you ask me.Still, he is a very good rapper. And this record is a good one too. But it it not as good as the classic Paid in Full. But I recommend this record, even though I don't think Rakim is the greatest ever."
1,boooooooooooring,"i dont know who this guy, but he sucks. i found this cd in my girlfriends car and it looked gay. i asked her about it and she said ""hes the god mc""... i say ok whatever trick. so i listened to it though, and the only good song is ""i know you got soul"".. and thats only like a 3/5. so dont waste your money on this garbage, buy some real hip hop like gucci mane or jeezy"
4,Don't knock what you can't recognise...,"I don't know. Maybe people are too used to all the gangsta s**t. Maybe they just don't remember. But this. This is part of the real talent that should have more props to stand up on.They say that they are real Hip Hop heads. They say that Rakim let himself down, that he'd lost it.Well he hadn't.This album goes to show that you can come back. Maybe not brighter, maybe not better. But with as much respect, and as good cuts, as the first time. Besides, how can they say that the album isn't as good as the original joints when on half of the album are the original joints.I bet they were bouncing your head to ""Guess Who's Back"" before they even bothered to check it.Shut up, sit back and listen to it. You may realise that Ra is talking a lot more sense than the critics."
1,Where's the plot?,"I work in the computer industry and I bought this book thinking it would be filled with lots of in-jokes, or just things I might recognize and find amusing. It did have a strong beginning but just a short ways into the story, the author apparently decided that sex and violence is all a story needs so he threw the plot, and any sense of believability, away. He gives us the most unreasonable and unlikely sex scenes. Point in case -- the COO of the company, the software engineer, the project manager, and the programmer are in a meeting. The programmer climbs under the desk and proceeds to .. um .. lick the software engineer's lollipop. The project manager, hoping this will all go away, keeps reading the project plan aloud; the COO has no clue what to do about this. Then we get random violence and death that has nothing to do with anything.Without hesitation, I will say this is the worst book I have ever read."
1,"Disjointed, misogynistic, ridiculous","I was incredibly disappointed by this book ... I bought it based on the reviews and was eager to read it once I received it ... the premise of the story is grossly over-simplified ... the character development is non-existant and - quite frankly - somewhat illogical ... the events make no sense and I had trouble relating a lot of them to anything else in the book ... they seemed to exist to get the story to a point where the author wanted it and not because they added to the story or support the character development ... but, most of all, the blatant sex was insulting and ridiculous ... the whole story revolves around a young indian womens propensity to sexually please those around her in order to acheive her goal of fixing software development ... this book manages to insult IT execs, indian women, stay-at-home-moms, introverted IT guys, and the reader all in one fell swoop ... avoid it like the plague!"
2,Amateurish and incomplete. Skip it.,"This 144 page story is a collection of stale and uninteresting software development tales and observations glued together with a bunch of very lame sex stories. The one interesting idea, that IT workers really control things, is developed about as much as your average Slashdot posting.I gave it two stars because I *did* finish reading it. It's a very short book, but the spiral binding allowed me to read it one-handed while holding my newborn.If you're interested in IT project fiction, check out Tom Demarco's The Deadline instead."
3,How to get a geek to read a novel,"I started reading Coding Slave after I saw it mentioned on numerous blogs and after Bob Reselman, the author, was guest in 59th episode of DotNet Rocks!. I generally don't read novels but this one I had to read this one, it is a novel for geeks.In short, it's about 6 people that are somehow connected with one company that's struggling with ERP development. Then strange things start to happen.A really short description of what I think about the book: I liked the start. I was quite shocked in the middle and the end sucks.But it probably is a good summer read for a developer that only reads technical books."
2,confussing,"I was interested in the book because its where I was raised.What hurt were the fact that he only changed sime names.My Uncle is mentioned many times unflatteringly.He is reffered to as being openly gay,which he wasn't.It was very easy to figure out who all the suspects really were.I will be glad to name them if anyone wants to know.He should have changed all the names or not used just some of the last names."
1,Not good,"While the subject matter interested me, this book was written in such a style that I found it very difficult to stay interested. I felt it was very poorly written. The over-use of certain phrases, the format (what was up with that?)... just everything. I got to the point that I didn't really even know what the point of the book was. I'm very surprised it's rated as highly as it is. It's simply not a good book."
3,Mixed,"After seeing some of the scathing reviews on Amazon I was really hesitant to watch this movie. With remote in hand I was ready to stop it anytime I lost interest. Strangely the movie held me all the way through. After watching it I still am not completely sure of the point of the whole movie, but it was interesting. Filled with quirky characters that are not cuddly and likable, it is well acted drama with bits of humor. Stiller is much more subdued than his usual characters and I think he does an excellent job portraying a man who is getting over a complete nervous breakdown. This is just one of those odd little independent films that I will probably watch over and over on cable and never really figure out why I like it."
2,time filler,"I like everyone in this, but the movie was just flat. Really flat. Like going to the party where everyone is nice but there are no good conversations and nothing much happens. Just living is all. You go home and realize you could have had a more fulfilling time doing a million other things. Thats what this movie is - just existing and filling time and space."
2,Unreached Potential,"This film has so much unrealized promise...Ben Stiller gives a great performance as a emotionally stunted, narcissistic mess, but the film fails to come to any resolution that might bring him closer to his fellow humans. The female lead Florance, continues to protest that he really isn't the person that he is whole he continues to abuse her for no apparent reason than to soothe his paper-thin ego.There's no turning point where either character makes any useful insights, and I was left disappointed that everyone ends up in roughly the same empty position they started in.There are a few ironic laughs, but not worth the hours of emotional sludge one must sit through to experience them."
2,depressing and dark,"A dark, slow and depressing film.The acting was perfect, however the writing, directing, producing, and cinematography was poor. If you want to watch actors perform beautifully despite being surrounded by a less worthy crew then you may like this film. My heart goes out to the actors, they put their trust in the film making crew to put the same effort forth in the film as the actors did.One of the few films I did not finish, mostly due to the poor writing and producing."
1,the worst Stiller movie ever,I was excited to see that another Ben Stiller movie was available...but I was throughly disappointed in this one! Was not worth the time or money!
1,Waste of Time,"I thought this movie was a total waste of time. It had no resolve in the end, lots of wandering stories intertwined, and weird characters. But not weird in that quirky, sentimental way. Weird in the way that made me regret the hour and 40 minutes I spent watching it. Ben Stiller's character is OCD, incredibly selfish, and panders throughout the movie. While his female co-star ""Florence"" is completely disheveled, abused, and uninteresting. I do NOT recommend this film."
1,I still can't get into Baumbach,"I've given his film a few chances. The Squid and the Whale featured characters that were unrealistic and artificial, speaking in ways that no human would ever speak. Margot at the Wedding was so inaccessible that I turned it off after 30 minutes. I tried again with Greenberg and was yet again disappointed.Ben Stiller's talent is wasted on an obnoxious character, and there is a woman he fancies who always sounds like she's falling asleep. Also, it's set in L.A. but everybody wears sweaters as if they're living in Canada. The plot meanders and the ending fizzles out.No more Baumbach for me."
1,How annoying can one man be?,"If you think the idea of watching a 40-something-year-old man attempt to minimalize his life to the nth degree could just be quirky enough to be interesting, think again. Written and directed by Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale), Greenberg is an exercise in cinematic endurance that tests the audience's patience to the breaking point. How long you last will depend on how interested you can force yourself to be in the lives of Greenberg and the people he passes along the way. Chances are you will snap long before the movie stumbles to its pretentious ending.[...]"
1,Don't waste your time,"All I can say is, just keep on walking and don't waste your time. Complete waste of Kodak film."
1,Annoying Characters in a Practically Unscripted Free for All,"Do yourself a favor and read a lot of other reviews before renting this movie. If you like a lot of unscripted, ad-libbed, yet completely annoying characters having a boring free-for-all, be my guest and waste 1.75 hours of your life. People have various opinions for sure, but I'm struggling to see any value, insight, or anything worthwhile in this low budget film that was shot in Hollywood itself. It was almost as if it was desined to make a quick buck. Absolutely worthless and a completely annoying movie imo. If anyone can appreciate anything other than complete irritation with this movie and the predictably annoying characters, please let me know. Terrible and annoying!! I think the last time I got this mad was after watching Madonna's ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" or""Who's That Girl"" ... almost as irritating."
1,What???,"If you suffer from insomnia, attempting to watch this ""movie"" will cure it. You'll be asleep in no time. I am at a loss for words to describe how awful it is. Glad, I only paid the $1 rental dvd fee."
2,The trailer fooled me for once.,"This film was marketed like Stiller's return to good films. I saw many big posters while leaving theaters that had me waiting for this one. I couldn't watch it at the theater because it came and went so I rented it on blu ray. The most disappointing thing about the film is the central character, if only he was a little likable, this film could have been much more tolerable. The director should have had a more promising cast, the pace of the film was all over. This film didn't even have a saving grace other than the fact that it ends. This is not even worth watching on home box office."
5,Greenberg,"Great movie! I don't understand all the negative reviews. Perhaps, this movie isn't for everyone. The characters are presented as realistic; not pretty or nice. This is not a typical ""feel good"" experience. But Greenberg does change and that is hopeful and real. This is not a typical Hollywood movie, Greenberg presents real people with real lives and real problems."
3,huh...,"so,as those of you who have read my reviews in the past know i am a huge fan of the team that put this film together. similar to kicking and screaming the main character is at a crossroads in his life and is unsure what/if he wants to do anything with his life and what the next step is. sadly, though, this is where the film veers off into its own world...sure, there are some good lines and awkward yet awesome situations, but by the middle of the film i found myself wondering where it was all headed. sure, i get that that is part of the point, but i feel like ben stillers character had a cool young adulthood and could be headed towards a rebirth ahead and we are left with the middle years where nothing happens...why couldn't we see ben as a rocker or ahead another ten years wen he gets his act together and starts rebuilding his life?i just think this movie captured the wrong points of this mans life and left a lot to be desired...doug"
1,Hated it,"This movie was so bad I turned off about 15 minutes before it was over, because staring at a wall would have been a better use of my time than watching this movie. The characters were so unlikeable it was hard to watch. They were awkward and had no redeeming qulaties, nor could I relate in the least to their actions. I would not waste my time on this movie even if it were free."
1,No review,"I had to step back, but my review stands. The movie is really misanthropic, and not in a great way.Ben Stiller is a master of playing a likeable idiot. Here, he is just a really bad person, somebody you'd meet in rehab who would send you back to some ugly behaviors out of sheer disgust. Which is OK as a premise. If only it were funny.And it's not. Stiller is a genius. But even genius cannot erase a totally awful enterprise like this. Move on, big river."
3,Eh,The DVD case came broken in (or caved in). Wasn't packaged well enough. The DVD came out fine but could have been worse.
1,A waste of your time and life watching it!,I spent only 30 mins watching this rubbish then flicked forward to see clips and realise that it was all a load of rubbish. My god! with all topics and characters out there they made a film about a sad loser bloke and the drivel that happens around him and to him.I recommend you go through your garbage for half an hour and you'll have enjoyed that more than this film!Avoid at all costs!
3,Worth watch...,"I really like Ben Stiller and Rhys Ifans so I thought, why not? It is not great but worth your time. I agree with what others said about the ending as it really does not have one. Really. There are some funny scenes though and this is not your typical Ben Stiller film as he ""acts"" in this one. I love Zoolander and the silly films so this was a bit different. This was actually a comedy leaning towards drama just a little."
3,An oldie,"The book is a good read and as a peony enthusiast I think it is worth the time to read it. However, it is of course not updated on the latest types of cultivars and so on. Compared to Alan Rogers' fabulous book this is simply too old and the information out of date. Nevertheless, some useful tips and nice descritions."
5,This CD is the best for relaxing. I find it to be a great,"When I first heard Chico Debarge on one of the morning news shows, on a sunday morning I feel in love with his music. I went to three diffrent record stores to find his Long Time No See CD, and when I finally found it I played over and over. Thats how great I find his music."
5,RED A.K.A. SHORTY (MIAMI) TRU SOLDIER 4 LIFE,"WHAT CAN I SAY BUT CHICO DEBARGE IS THE BEST. HE IS A GREAT SINGER, HAS A LOT TALENT AND HE IS ALSO ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGERS. THE WHOLE ALBUM WAS PHAT, IT WAS THE BOMB. HOWEVER MY FAVORITE SONG WAS (NO GUARANTEE) THE REMIX IT HAS A NICE BEAT, NICE LYRICS, AND THE VIDEO IS ALO THE BOMB. CHICO IS FINEEEEEEEE! HE COULD COME TO MY DOOR ANYTIME AND RING MY BELL, I'LL DROP MY MAN FOR HIM ANYTIME. HE HAS A GREAT BODY, CUTE FACE AND HE IS ALL THAT AND THE BEST IS THAT HE IS NOT CONCEITED LIKE THE REST OF THE SINGERS AND RAPPERS. MUCH LOVE FROM YOUR GIRL YOU KNOW ?"
5,"Deep,yet very sexy and alluring...",This CD has 14 wonderful songs which I enjoy a lot I could just listen to this CD over and over again. A great musical piece of work.
3,Chico is as talented as they come from a great family,"Chico can sing...he has the chops to carry a tune to masterful levels and this album is a nice offering of where he wants to go, but hopefully time hasn't passed him with legal problems."
2,average,i liked iggin' me but mainly because of El.Chico is a so-so singer and the music doesn't change that much.he should do more up-tempo cuts.now on the other hand EL Debarge would have made this record a smash.
2,NOT THAT GOOD!!,"I've read that people compare him to d'angelo, I mean the guy has a crooning voice but he doesnt even compare to d'angelo, just another r'n'b singer. His voice is too weak, his songs all run into one another and they sound the same. Why not just buy one of the many other middle of the road rnb albums... or play the same song on repeat it will have the same feel.."
4,Nice Neo Soul,"If you like neo soul youll enjoy this CD. I find that so many artists in this genre are ahead of their time. Chico Debarge is one of them. This came out before people really got into the whole ""neo soul era"". I used to have it on tape!!! The songs range from mellow and sexy to make em dance! I cant think of 1 I dont like and the bonus track No Guarantee w/Jo is my personal fave. Dont sleep get this CD!"
4,Excllent Come Back Disc,"After spending eleven years in jail, Chico Debarge returned with an excllent disc Long Time No See. The disc has a neo-soul/contermopary R&B feel. Debarge holds his own on the truthful Iggin Me and No Guartnee both of which were huge radio songs back in 97 & 98. Other standout tracks include Ms.Wonderful, Physcial Train,Superman and Trouble Man. Here's hopinh Mr. Debarge returns with another album soon."
5,"The BEST CD that 1998 has to offer,","Chico DeBarge's latest CD ""Long Time No See"" is by far the best CD this year and maybe even EVER! I love every song and totally feel Chico's pain. I want the songs to never stop because I never get tired of listening to his story, who would? He appears to be beautiful inside and out. The songs on the CD reflect the things he's been through in his life including the time he spent in prison. The CD has something for everyone. Some people(without any musical taste)have compared this CD to D'Angelo. That was the funniest thing I heard in a while(no disrespect to D'Angelo). You CAN NOT compare these two artists. Anyone who is interested I give you my word you will NOT be disappointed. It is worth everydime!"
1,What is this !,"i thought this book was poorly written, it was to corny the settings unplausable and the characters act like their twelve rather than fourteen i was interested in wicca but i couldn't even bring myself to finish this book it was so boring. The plot would be fine if it's content could back it up."
1,Not A Good Book,"I was at Borders and I saw this book. My friend told me not to get this, but I did anyway. I wished I listened to my friend because I wasted my money on this dumb book that I didnt even like. For me, I thought that this book was poorly written. It had a slow beginning, and the main character, Kate, annoyed me. I dont know why this book got good reviews, because it was horrible. If there is still anyone out there who still wants to read this book, RENT IT FROM THE LIBRARY, its free that way."
3,So-So,"This series is not all I hoped it to be. There are quite a few subliminals on trends for today. The storyline seems fairly decent, but a person can only take so much of those lines in between like ""Ooo! Isn't this dress great! It makes me look just Britney Spears!"" and ""No, no. Green certainly isn't your color. You don't want to look too much like Christina Aguilera."" I did, however, enjoy about 50% of the story...and I like that a fair amount of truth with Wicca came out in this book. (i.e.:Maypole Festivities). If you're looking for a really great new series of books based on Paganism/Wicca or supernatural, the I'd suggest Cate Tiernan's SWEEP series books."
1,Wiccan hype as a writer's cash cow,"Appealing to teenage wannabes who don't know authentic from inauthentic information, this book is about some ding-a-ling teenybopper's first spell, a love spell, that makes her the most sought-after girl in her school. Yeah, right. This books presents Wicca and Paganism in a shallow light, and the the author seem particularily knowledgeable about either."
5,A great series,"I really enjoyed this series (even at age 24) and so did my fiance.Kate did seem shallow in the first book, but having read the series, I was quite impressed by the way the character matured.The three characters--Kate, Cooper and Annie--are quite different from each other (the popular girl, the rebel rocker, and the bookworm) and so most people will find at least one character they can identify with.Although not 100% realistic, I'd say these are at least 90% realistic, and portray Wicca in an accurate and realistic light.If you're looking for supernatural horror, this isn't it. IF you're looking for a character-based series about real Wicca, you've found it."
5,Great Job Isobel Bird,This is a great book and I cannot wait to read the next book Merry Meet. This is a great book to just relax and read and at the same time you learn a little about the craft. I believe in magic as I do candle magic. I have read some about wicca and I do plan to get more information books about it. Reading about these girls have set a spark off in my heart. When you read about their chanting you can feel the power within their circle. It is very exciting. I found myself wondering and many times I could not wait to find out what was going to happen next. I went to the bookstore today and bought books 2 and 3 and I will be buying each book as they come out.
1,Disappointing new series,"The concept is good (the Sweep series by Cate Tiernan testifies to that!), but the execution is poor. The characters don't seem alive and there is far too much passive voice and telling rather than showing. Later books in the series might be better, but this one just didn't work."
5,This series is too good to miss out on,"I'm a bookworm, and i've read a ton of books. I've read them all, Tamora Pierce, L.J. Smith, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, Jane Yolen, Anne McCaffery, and J.K. Rowling to name some of the best. Of all the authors i've read, I'd say that Isobel Bird is one of the best. It's realistic fiction, something that could really happen, but with a magical quality to it. It's something that I think any parent or adolescent would enjoy this book and I give it 5 stars. I mean even my little sister liked reading it, and she hates reading!"
5,The Four Knights are Better than 4 Stars!,"I was always amazed at the talents of the Four Knights when I listened to them singing on various old radio shows, like Bing Crosby, Amos and Andy, Jack Benny and others. This particular CD set covers many forms of their stylistic music, especially sacred/gospel selections, which I have never heard them perform. What a surprise and blessing! Must have CD for those you love these gentlemen and a treat for someone unfamiliar with them."
1,WRONG ZONE,"I am sure I would have loved the movie if I had been able to play it. When I ordered it, I did not see that it was for another zone and would not play on my DVD player. Now I have to figure out how to return it. ."
1,Badly advertised wrong region!,"I admit that I am responsible for making the mistake of ordering this DVD, but some of us don't always know what we're looking at in the product listings. I am not accustomed to having to pay attention to the DVD ""region,"" wasn't familiar with region issues, and so I ended up with a useless Region 2 DVD. This was a lesson that cost me for the DVD and shipping. I want to suggest that when the region is NOT a standard U.S./Canada Region 1 DVD, that it should be stated in a bold attention-getting font size. This way of listing so subtly reeks of being deliberate in order to sell these DVDs to unsuspecting consumers. I would also like to add that the mailing packaging was flimsy, and the DVD was loose in its case. Needless to say, I am not only stuck with a DVD that I can't watch and no one wants, but I also don't have the movie I wanted. I will be watching this kind of situation very closely in the future, and I plan not to order from the offending company again."
4,"""Hello Again"" Pleases Again","Hello AgainI enjoyed this movie when it first came out. Recently, I remembered the storyline, searched for the movie, and purchased it through Amazon so I could enjoy it again - which I did."
1,A wonderful memory but sent into the wrong format!,"I was looking forward to watch this classic, just to learn it was in another format my dvd player cannot pay. Returning it was impossible."
3,silly film?,"Shelly Long plays the wife of a doctor who chokes on a KoreanChicken ball and dies, to be raised again by her occultpracticing sister. She falls for another doctor in hersecond chance at life. There isn't a lot of seriousmaterial in this script. It is a light heartedromantic comedy with a few laughs about face liftsas compared to child care in modern society?The dog ""flippy"" seems to be as important a characteras many of the main players?"
5,I love Hello Again!,"This is one of my all-time favorites! Yeah it's cheesy, but it's so funny... you really can't take it seriously. I can practically recite the dialogue with the movie, I've seen it so many times... it's great! Shelley Long is hilarious in this role."
5,Melt into Glen Hansard's voice...,"I am a recent convert to The Frames, somehow i missed out on them for the last 10 years or so. I saw the movie ""Once"" earlier this week, and tonight saw their live performance at the Bumbershoot music festival in Seattle. They are amazing, the entire band (i love an electric violin...), but for me it's Glen Hansard's voice makes the band amazing. I cried during the movie, and if I wasn't so happy to be there i would have cried during the performance. This is an amazing album, it's worth ""the cost""."
4,Consistent album from start to finish,"Glen Hansard definitely knows how to write good lyrics. Musically the album was more monotonous than I expected it to be. But the album has a very well carved tone that does not change from start to finish. Even the songs previously featured in Hansard-Irglova's ""The Swell Season"" are re-arranged to fit the album well. My favorite song is probably is ""Sad Songs"", a very simple and beautiful song that moves you, but does it quietly. This is my first Frames album, so cannot compare it to the rest, but I am pleased with my purchase :)"
4,Love Song #2: Falling Slowly from the movie,"The song Falling Slowly is wonderful, the rest are fine too, but I loved this one from that Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová in their 2007 film ""Once""."
3,Disappointing,"Mostly ballads, The Cost seems like a Glen Hansard solo album. But that's not really the disappointment here; few of the ballads present anything unique or musically compelling. Yes, Glen has a lovely voice and conveys great empathy, sincerity and beauty. But the songs themselves get too monotonous after a while."
2,Banal,"Amazon's own reviewer hit the mark with ""Cat Steven's tonality"". The voice is very reminiscent, despite the Irish accent, and the muscianship here is very good. Unfortunately, the lyrics and emotions could have been recycled from that earlier era: there's nothing new here. Repeating the same words over and over, or drawing them out for multiple beats, doesn't give them any deeper impact when they're full of cliches and expected rhymes. A couple of songs try to rise above this, but by the end of the album you (well, I) want to give the singer a swift kick in the backside to get him out of his ""stuck record"" groove. (Records, LPs, there used to be this needle that went around in a groove and... oh, never mind.)"
1,What a waste of paper!!,"The useful information in this pamphlet could be reproduced on one sheet of typing paper, double spaced. Make that triple spaced. What drivel. He talks about ""timing"" a single shot pistol by assuring that you pull the trigger guard all the way open every time. It's almost impossible NOT to!!The author talks about his minimal experience as if it's the grandest thing on earth. His repetion of drivel to fill pages should have been embarassing to him. He's apparently beyond embarassment. A high school kid stretching a paper this far would get a D for a grade. This is a minimal D.Definitly recommend against this piece of crap."
1,Why didn't I read the reviews for this book?,As stated this is worthless. It is not a book but a pamphlet. I skimmed it in a minute before concluding I was taken. I don't know what the author was trying to accomplish. You can learn more from a 5 minute internet search.
3,Contender Pistol,"Good book on pistol no longer in production. Information is dated and may be outdated. Use other sources before accepting as ""gospel."""
4,Ol Skool by Ol Skool,"Smooth,Smooth,Smooth. I'm very impressed! I hear they have a guy named ""Tony"" that plays a great centerfield too.Are all these guys multi-talented? From 1B #32"
3,"Good, but not durable enough","I read reviews and watched videos before purchasing this piece. Everyone said that it lasted longer than most dog toys. Unfortunately, it lasted 20 minutes for my pittie puppy who destroys everything. I'm still looking for the toy that last here longer than 1 week."
3,No .JPG support yet,"Like it and it works well except it is truly an Internet Video Camera only i.e. it cannot take a picture as a .jpg. Support says a firmware update is coming. Also, the Windows app for scheduling recording is useless. Just use it through a browser."
1,I agree with the rest of the reviews this equipment is terrible.,"Some of this may have been my fault as when i talked to an agent on the online chat I was first told that this camera could be used for security and a pc camera for video conferencing. I found that not to be the case after asking trying to confirm at the end of the chat.The video quality is absolutley terrible, grainy is an understatement. Word to the wise, dont waste your time on this product as the other reviews were completely accurate. Shame on Cisco for offering such a qwarky product no matter what the price may be"
5,"An amazing little gizmo for fun, security and more!","When I purchased this product, I figured I'd have a nice little ""oh wow"" gadget. But after setting up the camera, which took 6 minutes (and only that long since I have a 128-bit password on my Wi-Fi network) I was amazed with all it could do. By entering the camera's IP address into my browser (like http://111.111.111.11) I am able to view real-time video, program the camera to E-mail me a .asf format video if it detects movement and even change the network settings.A special application can also be installed on your PC that allows you to set up scheduled recordings (in case you want to check on a baby sitter, or handyman) or click a button to instantly record real-time video on the camera.This camera is amazing and I'm enjoying the ""oh wow"" factor as I continue to find excellent real-world uses for it in my everyday life."
2,Not for everyone. Very specialized.,"This camera is good, IF you meet all the conditions, AND you want to pay an annual bill. You must use Windows. You must use Internet Explorer. You must modify your router settings. You must subscribe to Linksys' DDNS service. This service, Sololink, costs $20/year currently. You can get much cheaper (free) DDNS, but the camera only works with Sololink.You CAN NOT view outdoors. I was thinking they meant you can't PLACE IT outdoors, but no, you cannot aim it toward sunshine. It will email, but won't FTP to your website."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I purchased this camera to monitor my house while at work. It has a built in motion detector, but does not detect motion very well. I have the sensitivity set to ""high"". Unless it is extreme motion very close to the camera, it will not detect. Cannot make out images in low light conditions. Ok, for letting the grandparents see the grandchildren online, but not for security."
2,unbiased comment,"if you plan to see your kids or your pet or your office on the Web , then DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA !if you want to see your kids or your pet next room , it is ok .*Wireless is ok.*Video Quality is acceptable.*SoloLink is a mess (linksys ddns service).*Setting up for http Access is a mess (well, it doesn't work with my linksys router)if someone has already put this camera on the web , please contact me, xes_traderx@xamnetsal.com (take out the 3 x's), I will appreciate it."
2,BAD buy compared to Hawking Technology NC320W,"I'm kicking myself for getting the Linksys WVC11B! Sure, the setup is a breeze, and the camera works flawlessly, but don't actually try to use this as a security or video camera! You can't adjust the video stream or the file format, it forces you to use Windows Media at an unusable 1.4Mb per minute stream! So unless you have about 100 hard drives don't try to record video (even of a still room), and don't expect useful features (like fast forward!) while playing it back in WinMedia.FEATURES Hawking Technology HNC320W has that Linksys WVC11B doesn't: MPEG video compression (for small file videos easy to playback), motion sensitive (so a still room video is always a small file), powerful video editing software, Mac/Linux compatibility, all browser compatibility, up to 16 cameras viewed at once, powerful control panel with many more features.The Hawking HNC320W was even reviewed better by Laptop Mag:http://www.hawkingtech.com/images/laptopec.pdf"
1,Don't waste your money.,"I read the mixed reviews on this product and hoped for the best. I have been a long time fan if linksys because everything I have ever gotten from them worked very well for me, for what I need it for. I thought that this camera would help with security and would be fun to watch the cats and the house from work. I was really excited. Well the camera showed up, and it was very attractive, and very easy to set up. I didn't like that it only used WEP and not WPA, but I could have lived with that. The major problem that I had with it, and the major complaint is that the picture qualty is terrible... This is not a 140 dollar camera. I didn't have it out for 5 hours before I printed out my return label. Look at Axis lan cameras. A little more expensive but you can view their cams on the web and see what you are getting. Hope this helps you save some time and money."
4,I'm keeping mine!,"When this camera first came active on the Internet, we were happier than Howard Dean after the Iowa caucus...""FIRST, we're going to watch the pets! Then the driveway! Call the relatives! YeeeaaAAHHHHHHH!I am sorry to hear the other reviewers were not impressed. Perhaps the expectations were too high, but where else can you buy a wireless web camera with a built-in web server under $200?We have had it up and running for two weeks without a glitch. The picture is fine, in fact, my cousin is still on dial-up and it is the best picture she has ever seen. You have to set the picture quality to ""very high"". With good light conditions the picture quality is excellent, almost video camera quality.We are definitely buying another camera and recommend this highly"
3,Great Functions - Not so great resolution,"Purchased this camera in hopes of having a high quality camera to display images over the web.Setup was a snap. I have a WRT54G wirelss router using 128 bit encryption. The minute I plugged it in and changed my wireless settings it was working.This is a great camera, except for the fact that you can't change the HTML pages it uses when displaying the video.Also, the picture is not that clear at the highest resolution setting. It is comprable to my Logitec Webcam I paid ... for.The plastic it is made of is quite cheap and I have already broken a non-critical piece while turning the camera head, so beware.Still, this is a great price for a camera with it's own built-in webserver!"
1,WVC11B network camera,not recommended. can't be used outside as there isn't a brightness control (another user suggested taping sunglasses to it). very cheap feel and look.
1,"Poor Image Quality, HW/SW Unstable, Networking Issues","Am on my second unit. CCD camera sensor died on first one within a week of indoor use.Second unit has problems as well - locks up/has to be restarted constantly. Seems to be overheating, because if I power cycle the unit all the lights are on - must wait about 10-15 minutes to get it back and operational.Am unable to view cam image from my local LAN when cam resides across a Linksys wireless ethernet bridge. Other devices across that bridge are fine, so it seems a problem with the unit. I had hoped to use several of these across the bridge but obviously this isn't going to be possible.Image quality is terrible. Grainy, and out of focus, even at highest quality settings.Software limitations prevent you from easily embedding your camera window inside a custom webpage, and even then it seems you might only be able to do it from IE (the cam stream is delivered to a custom ActiveX control).Spotty documentation, which is typical of Linksys products."
2,1997 Technology ...Today?,"The WVC11b is a GREAT camera...for 1997.Perhaps it's too harsh to inflict this camera with the standards of a 2005 user, yet it fails miserably at being anything useful, other than a novelty in this modern age.This camera REQUIRES the use of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or above. That is understandable in 1997, but not in 2005. Many people now choose to use stable and robust broswers such as Firefox, Safari, and Opera.ONLY PC USERS can view this camera stream. Even then, it must be viewed through a horrible web interface served from the camera itself.If you think CYBERSPACE is new slang and LOVE Internet Explorer and poor image quality...this camera is for you.If you want a flexible webcam which allows you to use the video content in a myriad of useful ways...pass this one up.There are much better choices to be found."
1,no joy,I bought the camera to use with my wrt54G Linksys router as the reviews I'd read said the chances were best if you had the same vendor equipment. I set up the wizard to try and find the camera wireless but no joy. I'd read the wired hook up was a way to start and it found the camera. The problem came when it asked for an admin name and admin password. ????? I called tech support and wasted an hour an one half and still don't have the unit on line. I was told use admin for the name and password both.
2,"Horrible product, Took me 3 Days to Setup this damn thing.",I work as a technical assitant for more than 3 years. I am a software developer; point is I am very technical. And I could not figure out how to setup this product. I chat with Linksys techsupport for 3 Days !! Yes !! Unbelievable !! But I did. I own more than 5 different Linksys products they all are nice and works fine... just had to plug and play.But this product sucks.... as hell.I gave two star.... because finally it got started working but has many issues with camera and its software.I would not recommend this camera look for something else.
1,Not a real web cam,"I bought a Linksys WVC11b thinking that the $50 more I was spending than if I had bought a Dlink DCS-900W would be justified since Cisco owns Linksys. Cisco essentially built the internet, right? I thought it would be the most solid network performance. What I discovered is that the images the can only be viewed on machines running Windows, no Macs, no Unix, no Linux, just windows. The box said a PC was required, but I thought, ""It's a webcam! Surly that is just for configuring it."" Nope. Linksys states in on their support site, ""You cannot view video on a Macintosh."" I admit Macs are a small part of the market, but for $50 less you can get a camera that showes it's images on ANYTHING running java, even a phone! The camera is very well built, but a webcam should work on the web, not just in Windows."
2,after 1 year,"i have had this camera for over a year and never have been able to get the sololink service to work. i recently took one last shot at it and spent many hours with not so great tech support. like many others i have found it works fine for an intranet, but forget actually getting the ddns service to work. i even have gone so far as to try and sniff the packets to try and figure out why it is not working. the camera it self is not so great and the image quality is on the low side. it does not work in bright or dim light so it is really only appropriate for a normally lighted room. i broke down and spent the money for a toshiba web cam and in less than an hour i had it working on the web. the picture quality is much much better than the linksys. i love my linksys products as they are always on the leading edge, sometimes good, sometimes not so good. i do not know if the ""g"" version is better, but this camera is really limited to a role such as a baby monitor (if the lights are on)."
1,Get a Veo Observer Instead,"The editorial review failed to mention that this camera is terrible. The quality is poor, the interface is poor, and the feature set is lacking. The Veo Observer offers much better performance and value at a lower cost, and adds pan, tilt, and zoom. There is no competition here. I made the mistake of thinking this thing was a PTZ camera. Even if it was, I would have still returned it - it is that bad - even at $200. One good note - the setup was painless. Too bad 1 star is the lowest rating possible."
1,Not a great choice,"I bought this camera to view activities in a datacenter. While the packaging specified compatibility with various Windows platforms it did not make it clear that the image can ONLY BE VIEWED FROM WINDOWS PLATFORMS USING IE. So, the center managers Solaris box could not view the image and my MacOS X workstation could not view the image. When I viewed the image from a Win2000 box the quality was horrible, very grainy even in a well lit area. I have ended up connecting an Apple iSight to one of the rackmounted XServes in the center and using getting a much higher quality image for considerably less money. I really expected better of Linksys. One star is being kind."
3,Nobody's sweetheart.,"I really tried to like this webcam, but it's just too finicky. For instance, everytime my ISP flickers and I wind up with a new IP address, the camera has to be restarted. I'm sure there's a work-around, but I cannot stomach the thought of even 1 more minute on the phone with the Linksys support folks this year (they're nice enough though).The image quality is not great, and the focus ring is a joke. There is of course no automatic iris adjustment, so while it's set to record comings and goings through the front door, there's an amazing sunburst effect on the recording anytime anyone opens the door. Also, it needs full ambient light to see anything, so I basically need to leave the foyer lights on 24-7 to make it useful.I had planned on using 3 of these to monitor all the entryways, but I think it's just not practical."
2,"Soup cam. Spare yourself the pain, wait a year","I really wanted to like this camera. Make sure your store accepts returns.Router- ExcellentCamera-AwfulRouter Software - Pretty goodCamera Software -Barley any featuresThe picture is like looking thru a glass of soup.Indoors is dark and murky most detail is lost. Pointing outside, all is a white wash. It was not meant for outside anyway.Must use Internet Explorer to view from internet. Uses an Active X control. Not Java.The software is very limited. You can only do a couple of things - email or record a video. Does not store or send snapshots. I did not bother testing motion detect. as it can't see much anyway. You can make a couple of color adjustments and motion sensetivity adjustments.The networking works fine, but you have to reboot the camera after changing settings- instructions did not say this- hours of frustration.Wait a year for this technology to become usable."
2,IE Only,"Linux user? Mac user? Netscape, Opera, Mozilla, Firefox user? Go away. Linksys does not want you. This unit is advertised as an 'Internet Video Camera'. It should be called a Microsoft Video Camera. You can only view the streaming video in Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser (it uses an OCX plugin). No other browser will work. If you use windows and one of the many other newer, more up to date and still actively developed web browsers, the only way you can view the video from the camera is to install the Linksys viewer/recorder software on the PC. Pretty much defeats the purpose of being able to view the video from any computer on the Internet at any time (like say from work or an Internet Cafe or even a friends house.)"
2,"Only OK-Poor Brightness, but easy setup","I purchased this and have used it for a couple of weeks now... The though of an 802.11b camera was great since I utilize 802.11b and g within my house. I have a large house and cabling is impossible.This cam sets up very easily. I set up the link to Linksys via their fee service.My only gripe is the poor, and I mean POOR, contrast of the cam. Unless the room is well lit, everything will be too dark. Even adding a table light to the room means you'll only get the light and all else will be dark.Outside, as others have said, is totally impossible. It'll just be a white blurr.For those who can understand photography terms and principles, it also is a slight telephoto and it should be a 'fisheye' lens so you can see it all. I'd guess it to be about the equivalent of a 60-70mm.Fix these items and you have a great cam. If these are not an issue to you, it's a great cam and a fairly good price"
3,Why wireless,"This camera may be great for online video sessions but my intention was home servalance. As long as there is good light it works fine, medium light you can see figures w/o detail, dark forget it."
1,An options if low on budget,"This is my first purchase on this kind of video gear but not the first Linksys adquisition. I can count at least 5 Linksys product around my desk right now. I though that in spite of beeing a bargaing I would have gotten an excelent product as Linksys usually do. I certainly would not recommend buying this camera if looking for a home or office surveillance or monitoring option. The resolutions is good, but only with a very good indoor light. Don't even think about point it to the outside windows since it contranst and bright auto control are almost useless in this condition. After set up (wich has to be done exclusively with the included CD) the image windows is very small and cannot be resized. As a conclusion, buy it only if you cannot afford a better one or if simply you don't need something better. I give one start since it work (with several limitations) almost out of the box."
4,"Not phenomenal, but good :)","I am a preschool teacher and I think this book is a very good book. It is up to the parent if thier children should know the classic Mother Goose versions first or not.As for the negative reviews, I don't really see where they are coming from. What is wrong with a gender-equal, nutritionally correct, and environmentally aware book? Perhaps we should shelter our children?I love the user comment that quotes the Twinkle Twinkle rhyme as if it were negative. If you aren't teaching your children about pollution and conservation, then you aren't a good parent.Period."
5,A home run for all traders,"Around the horn , is very easy to understand and straight foward. I got to give credit to Dr. Manz for taking such a complex subject like trading and breaking it down to easy to understand trading strategies and money managment. You can read this book today and start trading these setups tomorrow. But better than that they work and generate profits . it shows you exactly how to setup a disciplined trade plan that still works in todays markets. I have read alot of other books on trading but this one cuts right to the heart of the matter on setups , money managment and the mind set required to be a consistent and profitable trader. I would recomend it as an addition for all traders library. It has been a huge help to my trading performance and consistency."
3,It is OK but overpriced.,"What I really liked about the book was the way it focused you on reading the chart and what may happen next. But like others who have posted reviews, the book was very pricey. I do like to read what others claim success with and this author has a system that works for him. As an investor this is another piece of the puzzle which I hope will help create something that can work for myself. Which is why I bought the book. At a lower price I would recommend this book. Lower as in a 50% reduction."
5,Informative and to the point,"To further incorporate the author's baseball jargon, Around the Horn is lean and mean, yet jammed with vital stats. Nearly every paragraph gives you a tangible idea that's easily understandable as well as theoretically palatable. There's no razzle-dazzle or wasted passages. It's the kind of book a systems' fanatic like me can't resist, and I look forward to converting Dr. Manz' setups into mechanical strategies.Art Collins, author ofBeating the Financial Futures Market"
5,Happy to find a rare item!,"This is one of my all-time favorite mixes, and I couldn't find it anywhere in a local market.So I was delighted to be able to buy a case at a good price,and to have it delivered so promptly."
4,yummy,The first couple times I made this dish I tried the package suggestions for mix-ins and I finally realized this product is best served plain - it simply has a very yummy taste. We are vegetarian and make a meal of this by adding a side of steamed broccoli or a small salad - I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and will be ordering again.
2,lentil rice pilaf,"I love lentils and I also like rice pilaf, but this product wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The seasoning packet leaves a lot to be desired as far as flavor goes. Nutritionally it's a good source of protein and fiber and good for vegetarian diets, but it definitely needs to be supplemented with additional spices."
5,Good on Pillows and Windows,"I love this book , the instructions for pillows are just what I needed and the photos and inspiration for windows are perfect. More attention is paid to other types of decorating though than window treatments. Still this is among my top 5 favorite home decorating books."
2,It's so-so,"Its a good book for beginners, I am a beginner. ALOT of the projects in this book seem like they are from the early 80's (yuck) even though it was published in 2000. If looking for a how-to book this one is good with tips only. MOST of the projects are pillows and window treatments, with only a hand full of other projects. NOT a good book for the younger crowd looking for tips and projects for decorating their home. Or anyone looking for something modern. I personally was very disappointed, and there are book out there that are SO much better."
4,Usefull for the slipcover instructions.,"It's fine, a little out of date, and a little blah, but it will help, as I need directions for sewing a slipcover for a smaller sofa.Jules in NOLA"
3,"Beautiful, high quality watch, but hard to read.","This ""skeleton"" watch is very beautiful, has the heft and finish of a very fine watch, and I enjoy looking at the works, both in front and in the back. But the ""works"" make it difficult to read the time since one must first find the hands, which tend to be camoflaged by the background workings. It would have helped if the hands had been colored and luminous in the dark to help distinguish them from the background.Unlike the experience of another reviewer, the watch keeps working over night, and I enjoy tilting it back and forth to watch what happens in the back.Five stars if the hands were easily visible, which is what a ""watch"" is all about."
1,not as advertised,"Unlike the illustration, the face on which the hours are shown is gold coloured,just like the hands and even the works underneath. Therefore the hands are indistinguishable. To read it requires great wrist and arm dexterity to get the angle right. Weird! It's unlikely I'll never wear it again until my funeral. Otherwise the production quality seems OK, and it works OK (as far as one can tell). It is REALLY BIG. Being entirely gold-coloured, it looks astonishly vulgar - hey - just like Wall St.! After reading other feedback I am not confident that Stuhrling will be able to replace it with the advertised product and I not want to enter into a dispute with their allegedly rude and grumpy staff, so I have just decided to cut my losses."
1,Stopped Working After 6 Months,"After about a month of shopping around and reading reviews, I decided on this Stuhrling watch. I loved the way it looked (and still do actually-it looks awesome!), but I've had it about six months and the thing has flat out stopped working. Its supposed to be 'self winding' but when I look to see what time it is, I see the hands frozen at 1am, or 3:30am...etc. I read in some of the reviews that some people wind the watch ten or twelve times before they go to bed just in case, and I've tried that too but to no avail-I still find this watch stopped on my wrist when I look to see what time it is.I paid over $100 for this watch, which I thought was a fantastic steal-but not so much when the thing dies after 6 months. I'm very, very disappointed over having flushed $100 down the drain. I would love to keep this watch or have it fixed but its not worth the cost, and since there is no battery its not a simple fix."
2,Did not last long,I purchased this watch 1-1/2 years ago. I only wear it to work in an office. It has always been treated with respect. It will not keep time any more and it seems to be working correctly. Seems like an expensive watch for 1-1/2 years usage. I've gotten 10 years out of watches that cost 1/3 the price of this one.
2,I wish I would not have bought this watch,"I bought this watch because I work on ""Wall Street"". I find the watch hard to read because the hands are the same color as the background. I've also discovered that the time is very unreliable. Either it runs very fast or very slow. I also don't like having to set the time every morning. Since I don't wear the watch to bed, it doesn't get moved and that's what winds the watch."
4,Helpful book for those looking for a direction,I have found this book a great source of information while looking into a career in psychology. I strongly recommend it to anyone who would like to persue psychology.
3,Thinking Fans Guide to the World Cup,"A mediocre effort I have to say. It's a good idea in principle, but in most chapters there seems to be a tenous link between the author and the country being written about. Merely travelers who happen to have been there for a game. To get to the true soul of the country a writer from that country should have been chosen. Though it might have been hard to find a togolese writer, there is surely one writer from a newspaper that could've been found. Instead they get a Kenyan to write about Togo. That's stupid, and falls for the lazy perception that all of Sub-saharan Africa is somehow the same. It's not, there's great difference between East and West Africa. It would be like asking a Russian to give insight into the role of soccer in England. Hopefully this book just suffers from a first edition sloppiness, and hopefully the publishers put better effort for a new edition in 4 years time."
5,wonderful,It was one of the most interesting book i read. It captured the country and its relationship with soccer. wonderful writers I wish I could compliment the editors and the writers . Selection of the writers was the essence of this book.Even people who are not soccer fans would like this book .It will give themt insight into nations politics and flavour of that country.Iloved reading itKiran
1,sorely disappointed....,not at all how described... sad...I have not other words to expound....be careful how you describe things! I most certainly would not have ordered if I had known it was a recycled library book!
2,Too many basic mistakes,"If you want to localize your website following advice from an author who:1) Believes that people in Iran speak Arabic;2) Thinks that the ""circle"" is an accent used in Czech;3) Thinks that ""Czechoslovakia"" still exists;4) Thinks that the word ""flu"" is not understood in the UK;5) Thinks that Telugo is a more important language for website localization than Italian;6) Thinks that Romansch is related to German;7) Thinks that German capitalization is ""more complicated than in English""by all means go ahead."
4,This book has gems,"First of all - I love the books cover - but the watermarked immigration/customs stamps throughout the pages can be a bit distracting. And why page numbers are only given on odd numbered pages I have no idea.This is the type of book where you read it and think - 'oh I know that already' but it really does help to have this as a reference when thinking about a multi language or culture website. Actually there are quite a few pointers that are great even if you're developing a site for just one language.The book covers a range of audiences which is great - but some of the content doesn't become specific enough - want to have a definitive list of what browsers support unicode - check the index, there are 4 sections that have content on this but unfortunately not a single definitive reference.It's a nice book to read - and for New Zealanders - we're not forgotten! Maori, and use of the Macron is mentioned, but not really discussed in great detail."
1,Nasty!,"I hope I don't sound Ghetto to you folks out there, but these cookies were nasty. They tasted like an experiment gone wrong. I had to throw out the whole batch. Nobody in my family liked them, not even my dad who usually eats anything.The cookies first of all are hard, the flavor is stale, you can't taste the white chocolates, and the cookie is too sweet. The macadamia nuts tasted like itself, but didn't make the cookie special. They really need to change the recipe for these cookies."
3,All in one,This book does a good job to show how different technologies are used in the auction application. I would advise the readers to go through a little bit of JDBC and EJB on the web at the sun website and also this book is available on the web. The site also has pointers to RMI-IIOP etc.
4,Embracing Death,"Alfredo Leiseca's The Messenger of the Goblins is a collection of surreal poems that revolve around the themes of eternity, existence, death, and life after death. According to Alfredo Leiseca, the revealing of the reason to our existence comes to us in a mystical way rather than through tangible things. Finding the reason of one's existence is achieved through listening and waiting for a message from the supernatural world; a message that pertains to one's soul only. The Messenger of the Goblins is filled with hopeful lines about the freeing of the soul in a life after death. It is a book about embracing life and discovering the cause of our existence and about embracing death in which our feelings, memories, essence, and freedom will remain with us as our soul transcends to a mystical world. Leiseca's magical world of goblins and phantoms encourage the reader to forget all his grieves and to think of death not as a sorrowful ending but as a rebirth to a new life."
5,great cd,"it's awesome , i love it , great gospel music , can't stop listening to it , it's bring you closer to heaven ,great for meditation and moments of prayer"
5,"Haunting, hard, heavy, and healing all in one...","What needs to be said? All the versions of ""Chinese Burn"" are exceptional...haunting sometimes, but overall is a great track in any and all of its incarnations. The other two tracks are also very good, and they help make this EP worth the money."
2,For Curve completists only,"I love the COME CLEAN version of 'Chinese Burn' so much I thought I'd enjoy this remix ep, too. Unfortunately, none of the various remixes of 'Chinese Burn' are quite as brilliant as the Steve Osbourne-mixed album version (track 6 on this ep. Track 1 is mislabeled as the album version). And the 2 ""bonus tracks"" at the end are bottom-of-the-barrel Curve throwaways."
5,Esssential reading,We were lucky enough to stay at a hotel that provided complimentary copies of this book in their rooms. This was our first visit to the Bay Area and we had no idea where to go. We relied on the ferry system and public transportation and had no problems. The book guided us to Angel Island where we spent a most enjoyable day picnicking and exploring the historic trails. What views! We constantly found ourselves consulting the restaurant and Best Of sections. We now own our own copy and next year hope to explore more of Marin County where the sun always seemed to be shining.
5,A San Francisco newcomer,"We mountain biked in Marin and along the coast line of San Francisco using this book as our guide. We began our morning ride with misty views of the Golden Gate Bridge from the Presidio, then crossed the span and discovered all sorts of cool trails that connected to sunny Mount Tamalpais. This book has very good access information to all the open space area trails and even includes a two page list of places to take my retriever. Packing alot of sports into one volume makes this book very valuable to me."
5,Best Guide,"My vacation to San Francisco lasted three weeks. I bought Golden Gate Trailblazer when I arrived and walked many miles with it as my guide. Treasured memories are Limantour and McClures beaches at Point Reyes National Seashore which I never would have found on my own. There's so much more to the Bay Area than Fisherman's Wharf and the cable cars and traffic. This book excels when it comes to organization with maps in every section and a very detailed index. I highly recommend it to hikers and walkers who have never visited this part of California's coast. Like me, you'll probably be surprised at all the places these local authors have packed inside."
2,inaccurate,"I just bought this book based on the reviews and will be returning it. We live in Sausalito and the Marin Headlands are essentially our backyard. I bought the book to find new areas in the Golden Gate area to explore but when I looked at the area I know well, the Marin Headlands, the information ( map and route description ) were inaccurate and misleading."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this. You do not even need the mat, it does not hook up to the TV. All you are paying for is a video that does not teach proper ballet technique & a wand. Give your kids dance lessons & save the money on this useless game."
3,Self help,This is a good book - but very hard to follow. In the first few chapters it seems like the author was just repeating himself. It took a long time for me to get through this book.I would not recommend this book.Kim
1,dont bother,"So i'm messy and disorganised a Palm Pilot (IIIe) is perfect for me. I do not buy animal products so this case seemed perfect. HA! imagine a thick piece of flexible rubber built so if it breaks there are no parts a child could eat. This makes it not only bulky, poorly designed, but in conflict with the actual purpose of owning a case. the top doesnt stay on unless its taped down and forget about dropping it as nothing is holding your palm down inside. besides all this, let me mention that the pieces are so crudely put together dont even think about having liquid near by - one spill would leak completly thru the case... I've not tested this theory, but logic states that liquid can go thru spaces like these. Save your money and effort and look elsewhere, a company should be ashamed to put out such a poorly designed product."
2,Bumper Case?,This case is really big and bulky. If you like to put your palm top in your pocket this not the case for you. You also have to completly remove the palm top from the case to hot sync.
2,Problem with palm III,"I've used this product for approximately 12 months. After a period of time my palm stopped accepting entries. I finally figured out that the pressure involved in getting the palm in and out of this product was the problem. Apparently it was causing a small movement between the front panel of the palm and the back panel, creating a loss of connection. No permanent problem was created, but I have had to stop using this product."
4,Works as advertised,"I use my bumper for carrying my Palm III around at work for recording data during my plant rounds. It was pretty cheap compared to others I looked at. If you are going to hotsync using your cradle it takes some getting the technique down on removing the palm, but since I use the IR port its not a problem. I highly recommend using this if you can hotsync with an IR device, then the only reason for taking it out is to change batteries."
4,Good but a bit hard to follow at times.,I got this because of the historical figures mixed in with the plot. It was a great book and I will read it again (party to clarify some things lol)! There were things that were hard to follow but if you keep reading they mostly explain themselves. I liked it a lot!
1,Could not finish,"Dense, erratic plot that never caught my attention. Quit half way through and can't really tell you what it was about, because the book did not know yet."
2,slow moving story .,good story line but I had a hard time keeping at it because it moved very slow. would not recommend
2,Tedious.,"This novel is unfocused, confusing, and overly complicated. Characters are undeveloped. Finishing this book was a chore - it started strong with an excellent premise and unraveled with a too-large cast of extraneous characters and too many competing storylines."
3,It's okay...,"It's okay about sums it up, although I must say I expected better. The story is interesting, but some of the writing is convoluted, where the graphic description of a scene actually gets in the way of the flow of the story..."
1,Not his best,"I love Tim Powers, but this is by far his worst novel. It's long, overwrought, and tremendously dull.Tim Powers is a master of making the supernatural believable, but here he falls far short. The plot is not only unbelievable, it is uninteresting. The characters are dull and underdeveloped and the story limps along, begging to be put out of its misery. I couldn't even finish it.You are better off re-reading one of his good books (On Stranger Tides, Anubis Gates, Last Call) than reading this."
4,Very good,Unusual take on Gothic horror. Well researched and written. Enyoyable read without being too heavy. Would definitely recommend to any fans of the genre.
4,"Yeah, I liked it but...","""The Stress of Her Regard"" seems to have been Powers' most ambitious effort at the time. It doesn't have the easy, relaxed readability of his earlier works and this caught me a bit off guard at first.It's got a 19 century setting, though there is a lot of area covered - London, Venice, the Alps and seemingly a greater number of major characters than one is used to with Powers.There is also a deeper and darker intensity to this work and although it's not a favourite of mine, I'll read it again and certaily recomend it to anyone who likes Powers."
2,unsympathetic characters and uninteresting plot,"Compared to The Annubis Gates, to which this book is kind of a sequel, The Stress of Her Regard features characters that never became sympathetic for me, and the plot is impossibly convoluted (even for Tim Powers). I didn't particularly care how it ended, I was just glad that it was over. Go back and re-read The Annubis Gates or The Drawing of the Dark instead."
3,happystudent,This book is hard to understand but was required for an ethics class as required reading. Bought used and in good condition.
3,Vice and Virtue,The book was very marked-up and highlites are only helpful if someone highlights well. These highlights were very sloppy and didn't even highlight topics or statements that were useable.
2,Meh.,"My first (and standing) thought is ""They've turned My Chemical Romance into elevator music!""The piano playing doesn't really do MCR justice; it's not dynamic enough. And the background instruments/noises throughout don't help either. It sounds way too jazzed up, but maybe if you're into jazz you would like this ""tribute"" more.I would definitely suggest the string quartet tributes as another (better) option for instrumental MCR, because they still capture the essence of the band, rather than just playing the music (kinda) but losing the gothic rock sense of it. An example of more dynamic piano playing (although I don't think he does MCR) is thepianocian on youtube. Something more like that would make this cd more memorable."
5,releaseing,ReleaseingGo easy cowboy...everyone makes mistakes......remember spell check is your friend.
3,Not quite right.,"We have had this TV for three weeks. It's hooked up to an SD DirecTV signal. It does pretty well with an SD signal, but it tends to try to readjust the picture frequently, even during the same show. It's a little bizarre. They other issue we have is with he DVD player. It seems very slow to recognize any DVD. And then it's slow to forward through chapters and can tend to lock up if you try to forward through chapters too quickly. We bought this TV for under $500 at Best Buy, but even at that price it's going back."
4,It was a good buy,"I bought this TV based on the fact that I have always owned Magnavox TVs. I have had it about 6 months and have not been disappointed at all. If I had to pick one fault....one other reviewer pointed out, it takes a little long to get the picture after pushing the power button. But to me this is a minor detail. good picture, good sound and I got it at Best Buy for less than is listed here."
2,"DVD stuck, bad vertial viewing angle","Brought this set and had to return it 2 weeks later. The DVD player didn't reconize DVDs that we can play with other DVD players. For the 1 DVD it could play, it didn't eject it out. We called the service center and was told to unplug the set, leave it for a minute, then re-plug in so the TV/DVD would reset itself. We tired it a few times but it didn't work. We had to bring it to a service center. The technician had to open up the DVD player and took out the DVD for us. The picture quality was good if you look at it at eye level. If the TV is on a dresser, and kids watch it sitting on the floor the image is bad, ghost like, bad vertical viewing angle. We connected it to the cable and it did pick up all channels available. The tunner works fine. We returend the set instead of exchanging it because the DVD player didn't work and the picture quality is good but not exceptional."
1,No Mounting Screws included or available!,"Don't buy this TV if you want to mount in on the wall! Special ""screw extensions"" are required according to the owners manual, where they give an 800# to order them. I called to order them (40$) and the guy said ""we don't have them in stock and I don't know when we can get them"". So, unbelievable, right!?You can't wall mount it without a 40$ kit that they can't get for you even if you want to buy it.I'd pass if I were you.Godd luck friends!"
5,Way to go K.Oda !!,Very nice japanese songs. A compilation with some sentimental songs and some with pop flavour in it. Gotta be one of my favourites. Especially Kira Kira and Love Story wa Totsuzenni.
1,Poor Quality of product,"I have used the fish basket about 5-10 times on my grill in the 1 month that I have owned it and already 2 of the wire mesh grids has come apart from the frame. I am sending it back for a refund. The product appeared to be well made, looked very nice and is heavy construction, however it did not last one month. Do not buy this product."
4,Whispers of Hope,One of my favorite daily devotion books. I have finished it once and am using it again. I like the way Beth Moore explains the scripture and also enjoy the directed prayer.
2,CAN YOU SAY H-Y-P-E ?,"This book is all about hype and marketing. David Siegelis a marketing genius over the web. I wish David would write a book onhis tactics of pumping up the hype on his book. I would buy that book in a heartbeat.However in web design, David Siegel has a nose stuck high in the air and gets flat out snooty on design issues. I think we can think for ourselves for design's sake. Killer sites is out of date on technology and isn't as up to date or in depth on web design issues. Siegel considers himself some sort of design god. However I think he has a long ways to go with his high end of mediocrity in design before he can award himself any more high fives.This book needs a serious revision, and overhaul of it's content. I have learned alot from this book through little nuggets of information, but it's age has come and past. Web design is now in it's 4th Generation.."
1,Go to his site...,"The proof is in the pudding. Or some such.Before you buy this book, do two things: turn image loading off in your favorite browser, and go to Mr. Seigel's site at:<http://www.killersites.com>That should tell you all you need to know. (And if you want some real fun, validate any of the pages in the site...)"
2,"if you get this book, don't pay more than Amazon's price","This book is perhaps more useful for the Web as it might be,rather than as it is right now. Scan it, borrow it from a friend orlibrary, DON'T do what I did, which was to pay $45 for it. Instead of ""bang"" for the buck, this was more like ""phfffft."""
2,Yawn,"It's a bunch of tips that anyone with a copy of Photoshop already knows, written by a guy who thinks that any design that doesn't look like his or makes any use of the HR, H1-6, P, or LI tags sucks. This ""third-generation"" site design crap is so graphically intensive it takes hours to download on a modem. Stick with standard HTML or wait for CSS"
2,Old News - advanced web designers should look elsewhere,"If you've been designing for the Web for more than about 6 months you won't find much to hold your interest in this book. It's chock full of the same old tired information about GIF compression, table layout, etc, that any serious web developer learned long ago. Yawn."
1,terrible,The book was pathetic and I agree with another's statementthat it was an insult to my desgin experience. Illustrations werelame and if I wanted an HTML book I would have bought one.
1,"Is this about web design, David Seigels ego or VERSO?","All the hype is there, but this book isn't amazing above that. Most of the book seems outdated since I've been using wisiwig editors and I do not subscribe to David's belief system in site building. It's a great overview book on web site creation, but touches on too many subjects and without going too deeply into any one of them. David goes into things like PDF which not too many people need to really go into as a site or web designer."
1,Hmm...,"It is amusing that Mr Siegel seem to think that content anddesign are mutually exclusive concepts. He is totally on the side ofdesign and has already declared himself the glorious winner of the ""battle"". Like Stanford Wallace he thinks he knows what the web is ""supposed to be"" and the rest of us had better adjust or go away. Thanks Mr Siegel, but I dont want to see the net turn into television. There are hundreds of better design guides online for free, and if you want your mind stimulated spend your money on ""Entertaining ourself to death"" instead."
1,This is design?,"I read the book and didn't think much of it. I visited thesite and gagged! I should've checked the site (http://www.killersites.com ) before I bought the book! This site is awful! His ""Jimtown Store"" site is pathetic ... at best. If this is ""3rd generation"" ... I guess the rest of the web is on the 5th ... or maybe the 6th."
4,The bible of Webdesign,"The bible for webdesigners: that's how I see this book. It has essential information for those who are starting in webdesign. For the ones who have some notion it still a good reference. Some information here is already out of date, but that's why David S. Siegel recently released a new book about this subject."
1,Be very careful when purchasing this book,"This book should be called ""Creating Killer web sites WITH Photoshop 4"". The techniques are made for Photoshop 4. If you do not use that program do not buy this book as it is expensive. Secondly the advice on web site creation from the book is outdated and out moded. Even the author has recanted and said that the way web design is out lined in this book IS NOT the way to go. He flip flops and totally does a 180 in his new book ""Secrets of Succesful web sites"". Therefore this book is 1) expensive 2) oudated 3) over rated 4) a waste of time and money 5) by the authors own admission- flawed Skip it...."
1,A rather annoying and limiting book,"Its pretty amazing how highly this book scores. Personally I found it to be both annoying and less than helpful. The authors main message seem to be: 'Be creative and imaginative when making web-pages, but only within the boundaries I'm setting up for you.' Also it seems very clear that any other way of making a web-page than the one(s) approved by the author are bad or even a 'deadly sin'. After reading through as much of this book as I could bear, I went through some of the web-pages I visit frequently and found that most of them have designs which are bad according to this book. I guess there must be something horribly wrong with me then because I like them, and counting their number of hits, I'm not the only one. There is stuff in here which might inspire you and give you good hints, but my advice is to be very weary of anyone who claims to have all the answers as to how to design a web-page."
3,Good guidelines,"This book doesn't teach you html. You should already know html before you buy this book. This book teaches you how to design good looking web sites. Personally, I don't think this can be taught. There are many examples of good and bad sites, before and after sites, but the old saying, ""Can't teach an old dog new tricks"" goes when it comes to art and design. Fortunately, these things are very subjective. What is bad to me, may be good to you. But in the end, there are only so few that really deserve to win a bikini contest."
2,How to do it wrong - with style,"Siegel's book is great for designers. If the only people using the web were designers, I would have given it 5 stars. Lots of information, lots of tips, severely misguided. The problem is, most web users don't give two hoots about over-designed-but-slow-and-really-really-unusable web sites. I gave it an extra star for effort. My suggestion, memorize everything in this book - then do precisely the opposite of everything you learned."
2,Don't buy if you already have the first edition.,"I bought this book for my design staff, as if they would be getting some great new information that would advance me as a graphic designer in the world of web graphics, but I found it to be the same matterial regurgitated with a couple of new images swaped out as examples. I expected far much more than what I got. In fact I was shocked to find that I actualy liked the first edition better."
4,Fast Photoshop and web design solutions.,"Within one hour, I was using ideas and suggestions. I've already utilized Siegel's reminderon creating transparent GIFs. The samples in the book provide new creative ideas for my designs. I appreciate his approach to pushing online design beyond a basic HTML layout.The print job on the book is very impressive."
3,Too quick to praise?,"I'm sorry fellow websters, but open your eyes, your minds, and your imagination. David Siegel does provide some worthwhile tips and common sense graphic solutions but enough to warrant all this praise? I doubt it. It was a book that had to happen, I'm glad it did, but if David Siegel is anything, he is a marketing genius. The world wanted it, it needed it, now it has it, now can we move on and find some real beauty in the design and shaping of this medium we like to call interactive online communication. I waiting to be WOWed in the way all of you seem to have been"
2,Tables - The great compromise!,"My my. People in previous reviews seem shocked that the author, an artist, would have such strong opinions on design. I checked this out at the book store and then visited the web site where I found a tutorial that clearly explained Tables, with great examples. Tables are the best tool to display the all important content and graphics for the majority of browsers. My opinion is, visit the web site for good artistic design tips but the book is overpriced. Sorry Amazo"
2,Slick Web site -- sad victory of form over content,"I admit it, I didn't even read the book: instead, I decided I would look at the Web site at http://www.killersites.com. Check it out. It's very slick, graphically exciting -- and fails to bring across the content. You have to actively think ""where the heck are the links? Is this a link or just fancy type? Why is that fish there?"" This would be a great book for someone who has a lot of useless Web site content and wants to make it look great"
5,Fantastic; a must read.,Not for the novice; this book will speak to anyone who has already struggled with the challenges of designing large commercial sites. It changed my entire outlook on Web publishing
1,David Siegel rentability,"I think this book is only a regroupment of all a lot of famous, and knowing informations about the WebSite. I'm french, and I don't think more about this book."
1,...yuk!,"Everyone else's comments aside, this is surely the most obnoxiously titled book on web-design."
2,You Can Safely Skip This One,"This book is far from being memorable. It introduced me to the fascinating world of typography and teaches a few tricks on keeping your web files and pictures as small as possible, but that is pretty much it. The author distinction among first, second, and third generation web sites is interesting, but not heart stopping, whereas he seems to really emphasize it too much. Plus, in 2002, this text is outdated."
4,"Good design principles, but technical parts are dated","I really liked the chapters where David Siegel showed case studies of various sites he had designed and the thought processes that went into them. I also enjoyed learning the basic layout and typographic principles he espouses (although he's slightly obssessed with blank lines--or lack thereof--between paragraphs!). However, the beginning of the book, with all the technical tips, is somewhat dated and I would advise a beginning web designer not to get too into them. For instance, with programs like ImageReady and Fireworks, we don't need PhotoShop plug-ins anymore to optimize GIFs and JPEGs. Also, there's a brief plug for NetObjects Fusion at the end of the book, but I think GoLive and Dreamweaver are both much better WYSIWYG programs. Still, overall, I definitely learned a lot of useful stuff from this book."
4,Good book to help with page layout and site structure,"This book is good because it only discusses one thing, appearance. Too many other books try to cover both the technical and aesthetic aspects of the internet, and they end up being impossible to use. I am an engineer, and fully understand all the coding aspects of the Internet. I just needed a little help with page layout, and this book provided the stimulus needed to spur my creativity. Technically, this book is a little out of date, but like I said, this specifically covers layout and typography, rather than HTML/Java/etc..."
4,This book really started a lot...,"I have a lot of books now about web design (as opposed to the coding/programming side of things) but really the first edition of Creating Killer Web Sites was probably the first book which helped to open people's eyes to the possibilities of good - or at least, not-indifferent - design on the web. I have both editions, and still refer to the 2nd edition and visit the web site whenever I feel the need for little inspiration. No I do not necessarily think that all of David Siegel's designs - or the designs he likes - are ""good"" per se, or to my taste, but at least, they get you thinking in different directions. Nowadays of course there are plenty of other books in this genre - most notable among them perhaps is HTML Artistry - with more up-to-date technical information, but Creating Killer Web Sites is still a very worthwhile addition to any serious web or online-based designer's bookshelf. And I do hope there's a new edition in the works :)"
4,Killing Web sites,A good book with a lot of nice tips and touches. But do think for yourself. The author is not a god
1,"This book was confusing, not to the point","I could not use this book. It did not start with the end product and show how to get there, a good Web page. I could not but get the feeling that the author just wanted to publish a book. Somehow I got that 'Bait and Switch' feeling."
2,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly...","David Siegel is obviously a good designer, but not of websites. I surf a lot, and create web sites, and I was bored to tearswhen visiting David's supposed ""premier"" sites! For a person so concerned about space, he wasted a lot of it in this book by filling it with uninteresting pictures with no real purpose but to boast (see ""bored to tears"" above). To be completely fair, there were some interesting points made, and yes I will use some of his ideas. But they were points that are made daily in books costing half as much! The good part of the book was the part covering reducing image sizes, the bad was the rest of the book, and the ugly were his web sites. Two ""thumbs down"" for me. Find a better book."
5,The first visually-oriented source for the new visual medium,"""Creating Killer Web Sites"" and my left-brainhemisphere began communicating before it left the store'sbookshelf. In the broadest sense, I consider myself more of an artist than techno-geek. Siegel balances images and words so any reader can browse, study or become immersed with it's content. I keep it on my coffee table and watch friends select it as if they've found the holy grail! I go back to it again and again as I hone my creative skills on the web--or should I say ""kills""?"
4,All things said...still a good book.,"Alright, so Siegel has an ego. So do most successfulindividuals in this country. The issue is not ego here, it'sinformation. The simple fact is that CKWS is a good reference. Not definitive, but good. This book assisted me with the re-working of my previous sites and gave me some inspiration for new ones.The idea of the ""entry tunnel"" was a great one, if slightly overused. The ""single-pixel GIF trick"" is also a very handy notion for paragraph indentation, image alignment, etc...But as is so very common these days, there are two ""camps"" voicing their own philosophy about Web design. These two would be the ""artsy folk"" and the ""techies"". My opinion is simply to let 'em argue, and just listen closely to everything they have to say..."
2,taste is subjective,"Sort of interesting and a few web tricks. Aside from theauthor's ego, which is almost laughable, look at his sites. they're ayawn, especially considering all the time he spent designing them. the best example is of the Jimtown store. I've been to both the store and the site and the site doesn't even come close to refecting the store. Seigel spends paragraphs explaining how he came up with his ideas and their execution but it's a very mediocre site. He's an OK technician but his design taste is very first generation."
3,"fine book, but not worth the hoopla","This is an insightful book for those of us who have not taken the time to research Web design issues themselves. A lot of the tips in this book are simply compilations of others' ideas or pure common sense. As an anthology of good Web design, this book succeeds, but David Siegel is hardly a god! I wasn't exactly blown away by his ideas"
2,Not as good as the hype,"This book and this author have received a lot of praise. I don't think that it is justified. I found the book interesting from a purely graphic design point of view, but I can't imagine that sites built using Mr. Siegel's methods would warrant more than one visit."
4,Still an Enlightening Guide,"This is by far the best book on good site design. The three parts of the book deal with design basics (images, types, layout, etc.), actual page building (personal, e-commerce, ...), and CSS. Written in a lucid style, the book is a pleasure to read and follow. I'm graphically deprived, but even I found the book very helpful and enlightening. I'd still hire a good professional (such as Mr Siegel himself) to do the job right, but the book has shown me how to put together a better personal homepage.All this book needs to get 5 stars is an updated edition. This 2nd edition was published way back in 1997! A bit too old, but again, still useful."
2,Ego Uber Alles only goes so far.,"Disappointing -- a handful of genuinely useful technicaltips relating to image handling and the like are overshadowedby the egotistical rantings of a pompous blowhard whosedesign aesthetic varies from techno-gimmickry to blandimitation of printed media. Perhaps a helpful handbookfor personal home page designers, but nothing of use forprofessional website developers, who likely strive for""elegant"" and ""functional"" rather than ""gee-whiz"" or""killer""."
2,disappointed,"Based on the high reviews for this book, I was excited to pick this one up. (Although I wasn't pleased about the hefty price tag.)I skimmed through it last night and was let down in a big way. I was hoping this book would tell me something I didn't know or at least be a useful reference book to sit next to my computer. Unfortunately, this one isn't a keeper. I'll have to continue my hunt for a decent design book."
1,A pure Megalomaniac writer full of himself need psychiatric help,"This useless writer pops a new book each time he is depression , paper waisted some one should stop him"
2,"It's no ""Battle Royale""","In spite of the praise showered on this film by the reviewer above (who has two reviews posted on Amazon, both for Urban Vision products), this film is not at all the ""non-stop blood bath"" it purports to be. Kill Devil takes a premise designed for a pure B-movie exploitation flick, and attempts to turn it into a contemplative art movie. The result is a slow-moving disaster and a bore. One star for being a movie. A second star for mild humor value as children die without pain or terror, but long, sad looks of existential angst."
2,Kill Devil Review,"Ugh! That pretty much sums it up. With no story and no gore this movie has very little going for it. I picked it up because of a review I saw mentioning that the movie was inspired by Battle Royale. So, I decided to give it a try.The only thing that made this movie bearable was the constant heckling my friends and I gave the movie as we watched it. I don't know what I would have done if I was by myself. Oh Wait! I know, I would have turned it off.So in the end 1 star for being a movie and a second star for the dialog track that we supplied for the movie.Oh, and one more thing if you do decide to get it and manage to get through the movie without shutting it off check out the alternate ending. None of us saw that coming and it had us rolling on the ground for an hour laughing."
1,Cookies Crumbled!,"Fairly tasty morsels. Literally. Morsels. Tiny morsels. Crumbled cookies fit for blending into ice cream, topping cakes, or maybe using as crumbs to make new, whole cookies such as bourbon balls. A pity. The ingredients are good, the packaging disastrous! (And the wait was very long. Took months to ship.)"
4,The Great Airships,"This is a small but intriguing book that tells the story of the great airships from the early part of the twentieth century. It focuses on the American, British, French, and German airships that plied the airways of the interwar period. The ""Hindenberg"" graced the skies above the 1936 Berlin Olympics prior to its fateful trip to Lakehurst, New Jersey. The book covers the history and then transitions to the present with the Goodyear blimps.This is a relatively short but informattive book that is well illustrated. It gives the reader a good introduction to these airships that esemble floating rocket ships above the cities of the world."
4,Dukes of Hazzard Season 7,"Very enjoyable show, light hearted action with lots of stunts and car crashes. Brings back memories from the 70's or 80's."
3,Final season sees General Lee Not Firing on all Cylinders,"After the underrated season six which was due to the lead actors complaining of bad scripts, Season seven showed the new direction of the show was short lived.Even more insulting than the worst ever episodes in the entire series (Robot P. Coltrane, A Visitor In Hazzard) was the fact the the jumps were done with miniatures and toys that looked fake(stock footage would've done a better job and cheaper).The most interesting episode was Happy Birthday General Lee which flashed back to the time before the series started and how General Lee was created.The series ended without a true finale as CBS cancelled the show in 1985, and fans would have to wait twelve years to see the Dukes again."
5,Dukes Reunion DVD Possible After 7th Season?,"After 7th season, I think the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion that was previously aired on television would make an excellent DVD addition to the collection of all 7 season DVDs."
5,True Soul,"I tend to find that live albums usually have a bit more substance to them anyway, rather than the meticulously rehearsed work done in a studio. And this album certainly did not disappiont. You can't help but be won over by her style and humour. Best of all is her unpretentious manner despite her brilliance."
5,Dazzling spiritual sexy blues in the style of nina & billie,"It doesn't get any better than this Live concert album from Erykah Badu and her touring back up band Mother Eaerth, as you will hear as soon as you listen to this truly wonderful selection. Be sure to get Eryka Badu's first album as well with On and On and many great others. Eryka is here to stay - betta recognize and pay tribute. from sundays at home lounging to a dinner party to getting ready to go out for the evening, erykah's voice and music is the perfect blend to any mood"
4,great live sound,"this is one of my favorite live cd's, that's seen alot of play. favorite tracks are stay and tyrone."
5,Awesome live album,"This is one of the best live R&B albums I have ever heard. Erykah Badu's band sound absolutely great playing live and compliments Erykah's great voice perfectly. This album is wonderfully put together with all the songs flowing together nicley one after the other. During the live performance the band does a awesome jazz cover of the Roy Ayers's classic ""Searching"" that sets a beautiful ambiance for listening to the rest of this incredible album. The album also contains a extended version of the hit song ""Tyrone"" which sounds heavenly. I highly recomend this album to anyone who loves great soul music."
3,"pretty good,but a little too soon for a Live album","Tyrone is a Great song.but this disc on a whole doesn't measure up.Problem mainly is that she has only released one Album.an artist has to grow.a Live Album has to reflect changes in an Aritsts Career.her album was real good but it's way to soon to come out with a Live Album of the mainly the same Material.Badu does have a Future I Believe.as as Writer,Producer&Vocalist."
1,Stop her!,"I don't really know what people like about this album...I haven't got any problem with the music but the woman's voice; I mean her voice is too usual and too weak to sing indie r&b. If you want to listen to some really good indie music try India.Aerie, Des'ree or Sade (her live album is a succes) but please don't listen to this for the reason there are much better albums on sale now."
4,Live - actually 4.5 stars,I bought this disc shortly after it's original release - I actually got this one before her debut album! Anyone who's seen Erykah actually perform live knows that she puts on one hell of a show - she engages the audience and definitely sets the mood for herself to perform at optimal level.The standout tracks to me are:Ye Yo - a beautiful song about motherhoodOtherside of the GameStay - homage to the great Chaka KhanNext LifetimeTyrone - still hilarious & to this day I get a chuckle out of this songOverall it's an excellent addition to your collection if you're a Badu fan and I would highly recommend it to those who aren't familiar with her work.
2,not practical,Feet are unbalanced good set of quality crampons will work in ice and snow much better. the price was low so I thought why not try them. They look good on camera for stage shots.Would not recommend in real use.
2,Awkward for climbing with,"Its just plain hard to climb trees with these. it would be better if there were spikes more on the inside of your foot, not the bottom. One of the spikes fell of after my 3 attempt of climbing a tree (with my hand claws too). I guess these would be good for hiking or something but not climbing."
5,Golf shoes go on easily,"I have an arthritic back and it does not let me bend over to put shoes on or lace them.Most times, for business or pleasure, I wear loafers. My golf shoes, however are laced so when I play I sit on my van's rear gate and use the extended shoe horn to put them on. I then put one foot at a time on to the gate to lace up. This tool has saved me a lot of agony."
5,shoe horn,This was a gift for my son-in-law and he loves it. Dresses in a suit every day and loves the convience of this product.
3,Too flexible for me,"I wear a brace on one foot and use my shoehorn to help me wedge my foot and brace into my shoe. This shoehorn is too flexible to be of much more use with that than a small shoehorn would be.I also noted that after about 2 weeks of use, the shoehorn bent about half way in the shoehorn part (the part used to actually guide the foot into the shoe).Not for me, but if you like flexibility in your shoehorns, maybe this is for you!"
2,Duro-Med 24 Handle Shoe Horn,"unit was long enough, but the shoe horn was too narrow for my needs, and was not as stiff as I wanted"
2,Metal bends,"This thing is low-quality junk. The metal is too thin. When I use it for its sole purpose (putting on my shoes) the metal bends. The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is that even though it's all bended and warped, it still sort of works."
1,Horrible,The head bends with a little force.IT DOES NOT DO ITS JOB. It's terrible and horrible.Please don't waste your money.
1,Poorly designed,"While one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool, the manufacture has indeed done so. The ""spoon"" portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil. I supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility, but instead of using a fastener or weld, its just rolled metal inserted into the coil. After only two uses the ""spoon"" came out of the coil and even though I could easily enough put it back together, after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay. Basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now. Would recommend buying a more simply designed, single piece shoe horn."
2,Easier than short shoe horns,Quality is left to be desired and the shape and material of the horn makes it sometimes painful to insert the foot
3,"Duro-Med 24"" Handle Shoe Horn","This is a handy shoe horn, but I'm not sure that the spring hinge between the shaft and the horn is a good idea. Also, the metal horn has bent several times and while it bends back fairly easily, it may not be something that people are wanting to deal with."
4,Shoehorn,"I have been using the shoehorn and it is great, most of the time but a couple of times the horn has come apart from the handle because there is nothing holding it fast with the exception of the spring at the end of the handle. It is very helpful to me with the physical limitations that I have."
2,not the greatest,"My husband tried this and I had to return this to Amazon, every time he tried to use it.. the horn part would twist around and it would collapse. I had no problem with returning it."
4,"Great Protection, Good Value","After reading tigger221's review I ordered this unit. My house had recently been hit by a surge and I lost tv's, but not the PC since it was on a surge protector. The TV's went because the surge went through the cable lines, so I needed a cable modem surge in addition to the lines and phone. Its a substantial amount of protection, 1080 jules is double what I had. The prior unit did protect, but also failed and needed replacement. The plugs are far enough apart in two socket to take the big plugs for the printer and other peripherals without blocking another plug. The directions were clear, and the cord was sufficiently long. It was a little expensive, and that held me back from five stars. Still a good value. I hope to not use the protection claim offered, which is very good coverage."
4,Goooooo BLUE!,"I was a bit hesitant about buying this plush toy after reading some of the reviews. I took a gamble as my 2 year old has just discovered Blue's Clues and really likes stuffed toys. I was happily surprised when I pulled Blue out of his plastic bag. His fur was soft and he was quite cuddly. The spots are a different texture but I didn't get a ""painted on"" feeling that another customer had mentioned. I'm not sure if they change the batches periodically but this was from a good lot. So, if your child enjoys a cuddle and likes the show--I say this is a good buy."
4,Blues Clues Fan,"My 2 year old is a blues clues fanatic and wanted his own ""blue"" to hang out with. This adorable plush blues clues buddy was perfect. It is just the right size for a toddler. She is big enough to cuddle, but small enough to take just about everywhere. She is very soft and easy to clean. I would recommend this to any little blues clues fans."
4,"Nice atmosphere, good characters.","This is about some college kids that move into an abandoned hospital (because it's cheaper than the dorms). Little do they know that a mass murder took place there years earlier. Soon strange things start happening - mysterious symbols appear in the hallway, there's a weird guy living in the cellar, shrieking noises are heard in the night. Then, one of them disappears - EEK!This is a pretty good movie overall. I liked the creepy atmosphere of the abandoned hospital, and the characters all had distinct personalities and had fairly good chemistry with each other. I'd definitely recommend it to fans of low budget, somewhat cheesy horror movies."
3,Fun Movie To Watch,"I liked this movie - it was campy, goofy and just plain fun to watch - a real no-brainer."
3,31/2 Stars actually....,"I was really glad that I got one of the out of print DVD copies of this for Christmas. I had been really curious about this movie ever since my sister gave me an old Shrieker poster. She said the movie was cheesy and I said that that was perfect than LOL. I like cheesy movies. And well.....she was right. Don't get me wrong, the movie was interesting, had mostly good acting (some hot ones too), it was creepy and suspensful. The only thing I was dissapointed by was the lack of up front gore. Not that i am a freak about that stuff, I guess it was something I expected...BUT the movie was really good. I recommend it!IF YOU HEAR IT, IT IS TOO LATE!!!"
2,Eh...,I wasn't really into this movie so much. I was expecting horror and I thought this was more of a thriller/suspense. There was a lot of dialouge and overall the movie went too slow. The action is few and far between and some of the film is grainy. I'm going to have to say 2.5 for this one.
1,God have mercy on Full Moon ...,"This has to be one of the weakest horror films I have seen since Scream 3. The box boasts having incredible special effects, what a laugh! It was like watching a cheesy 80's horror movie, except without as much deep plot and quality acting! It is truly a sad day when I see a horror film that is even below being able to laugh at it."
1,"Kippi Brannon, Daddy's Little Girl",I was considering using this song for the father-daughter dance at my reception. I wanted to listen to a piece of it so I can see what it sounds like before I use it. Unfortunatly you won't let me. How can you rate a song when you can't even hear what it sounds like????
1,Why can't we hear a sample of this?,"I too wanted to use this for my wedding as my father/daughter dance but are unable to listen to a clip of it, because you don't provide one. How can I know that this is a good song without listening to it first."
3,Nothing spectacular,"Kippi Brannon has a incredible voice. Unfortunately, her choice of songs on this album limits the listener's opportunity to appreciate her vocal abilities. The songs on this CD are mediocre at best. Better songs matched with her wonderful voice will eventually prove her potential. Sadly enough, that is not to be found on this album."
5,Awesome Hat,I bought this hat for my dad and he loves it. I went back to buy another for my mom but they were all sold out. I hope that more come in stock soon because it's awesome.
5,They make food last longer,"I agree 100% withe the other 5-star reviews. I'm buying my 3rd set today.Unlike the other two reviewers, I DO NOT close the bags. I am also using an "" Extra Life"" disc [sold on Amazon] as well. Together, they allow me just to bag & put them in the refrigerator drawer without any special care.I do find the fresher the produce, the longer they last. So, I shop the grocery store where their produce is fresher.I've given these as family gifts. Thankful feedback is the norm."
1,Does not work!,"I found that using these bags did not really help fruits and vegetables stay fresh longer. Oh and I followed all the instructions that came with it. In addition, it actually made some rot faster! My friend bought these and had the same bad experience. I bought ""ExtraLife Produce Preserver Disks "" and it works much better and hassle free! you just leave it in the bin and change it once every 3 months!"
2,That this novel were an explosion!,"""There is no explosion except a book."" Ducornet opens her novel with these words from Mallarme. That this novel were an explosion! For explosions of the sort she refers to are what we need more of! But her pages are simply too damp and the light they give out, when ignted, too pale. And when compared to her inspirer, de Sade himnself, or his most lucid reader, Annie Le Brun, the poetry grows ever weaker and the reasoning, blanched as it is by a smothering tide of descriptions, both elegant and profane, too boring. If you wish the promise of perfumes and scandal, then Ducornet is your guide. But if you wish the reality that the promise shadows, pick up de Sade, isolate yourself and read from cover to cover -- for nothing more than to give him his due! de Sade exists in the words he wrote, and no where else..."
5,"""Fan-Maker"" Will Win Fans","Ducornet is an excellent writer, and this book is clear proof that she's one we'll have to watch for in coming years. What distinguishes this from the pack is her clear grasp of De Sade's thinking, and an amazing knack of making a pastiche of his style. The parts told in his voice really do sound like him. The fan-maker herself is a less well-defined character, but you find yourself believing her feisty responses to the dullwitted Revolutionary tribunal. All the prejudices, pretensions and illogicalities of the French Revolution are paraded in this short, but remarkably well-constructed book. The fan-maker, her lover and De Sade represent freedom, while the parallels between the Revolution and the Inquisition's behavior in Central America are clearly drawn, in splendidly gory fashion. Not for the timid or puritanical, but you won't read a better-written 'historical' novel this year."
3,Stylistically difficult to read...,"The style of the book took some getting used to, but the actual story is pretty interesting.A female fan-maker in Revolutionary France befriends the ever-licentious Marquis de Sade, and makes fans with ""provacative scenes"" depicted on them. The whole story is told in an interrogation setting, when the fan-maker is on the stand in court testifying about her relationship with the Marquis."
5,objective reporting,"Several of the negative reviews for this book seem politically motivated only and also contain incorrect information. The book, first of all, is not written by Sheehan and she will not profit from sales. Secondly, the book is an accounting of not only the pro-Sheehan Camp Casey but also the pro-Bush/pro-war side of things. It is objective and also contains interviews with some interesting people who were in Crawford, TX last August. The perspectives of the reporters were compelling as well, and one was decidely NOT pro-Sheehan, if you read between the lines. The editor added his comments about the challenges of a small town newspaper with minimal staff taking on the task of covering this event on almost an hourly basis for 26 days. It is a must for journalism classes everywhere."
4,Blues Brothers 2000 Soundtrack,I like these songs very much a few more tracks would have made this disc great. Whay an all star cast!
1,Unusable file type,The audio file type is worthless because it will not play in a traditional CD player such as the one in my car...
2,partially my fault,"Hi, I misread but I thought I was getting a DVD not a tape. guess I read to quickly.Is there anyway it could be returned as I have no device to play it on.Thanks"
5,OFFICE IS A ROCKING,"Saw the B Brothers 2000 Video. WoW...It's a buyer for sure! And had to go buy the CD Soundtrack..... It's a Slammer. Music is Awesome...All the ""old folks"" from 1st video are here and many more surprises for sure. Man oh Man, do they rock! If you want to get jamming and dancing and have a blast BUY THIS CD... you wont regret it. I have already burned 6 copies for friends. Dont wait...get it. You wont be sorry..Buy the Video also... Best yet. GO ELWOOD.."
4,BluesBrothers harmony,"The fineness music that I have heard in a long time. Ghost riders was a very refreshing tune done in a realistic beat. Of couse, the rest of the album brought the era of the 70's and 80's back to a tempo which made my big leg to bounce in rhythm."
5,wow!!!!!!!!!!! great performances by the blues finest,what can you say they are still on a mission got to love those gator boys this is a great songtrack from the beginning to the end
2,So-So Effort,"Doesn't quite capture the fun and energy of the soundtrack of the first Blues Brothers film, but it's passable. The best song is a remake of ""Funky Nassau"" which shows off the vocal talents of actor Joe Morton and Eryka Badu."
3,BB2k: lukewarm performance by big names,"This movie soundtrack brings together some of the biggest names in blues, R&B, and soul. This collection of talent should have resulted in a landmark album instead of the listenable but disappointing work that came out. I was particularly disappointed to see that the band strayed so far from the original sound that made them famous."
2,Better off with out,"I came across a number of errors in this book. Beyond the embarrassing typos, Several explanatory charts were missing, the bibliography promised on the title page was no where to be found, and at least two of the multiple choice questions in the back of the book were dead wrong when checked against my Biology 101 text.Frustrating to say the least. My advice is you're better off without it."
2,Not Worth the $$$$,"I purchased this book in order to review for my Biology Content Exam. Although the information is very very basic, it was a decent review. However, there were over 20 spelling and grammar errors. Also, the book contradicted itself. I purchased this book for $35.00 and I was not pleased at all. I would have been better off studying from a high school Biology textbook."
4,Salvation: The Bible and Roman Catholicism,This book is an excellent review of the major doctrines of Catholicism and how they are in disagreement with the teachings of the Bible. Strong Biblical support is given for every point. It is significant that the author is a former Catholic and that he had significant Catholic training. The second half of the book gives one of the most complete & yet concise presentations of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I have read. It stands in stark contrast to the claims of Catholicism as to the way to obtain eternal salvation.
4,Different . . .,"I had never heard of the band until I was in San Fran this past summer watching Jet, and they opened. They were amazing live, and I stupidly took their sampler CD on the way out the door, thinking that it would be easy to find their album. Wrong!! It took nearly 7 months to get their CD, but it is now one of my most played CDs. Their music is something that is different enough to give your music collection a little kick, but easy enough to listen to that you can relax if thats the only CD you have in the car."
5,A Pop-infused Punch,"Ok, I may be biased. I saw the band live three times this summer, and was blown away each time.This cd is mind blowing. It's a mix of rock and pop, with classical undertones. Electronic tinkering also comes into play. It's difficult to classify this cd, as it seems to break a lot of molds. Suffice it to say, it's got a lot of catchy hooks, with a bit of dirt thrown in. Favorite tracks of mine include: ""Pocket"" & ""Green Cats Eye"".If you like this album, their other album ""Lonerider"" would also be a great addition to your cd colletion. (Check their site: theeveryones.com for that title, as Amazon doesn't seem to carry it.)"
1,Too small,The dimensions were not very clear. The balls are about the size of a ping pong ball--not big enough for what I wanted.
2,"Only a picture book, and not a great one.","This is a loosely organized overview of Maseratis through 1995, concentrating primarily on road cars. It's primarily a picture book, and its lack of substantive historical or technical data is frustrating. The pictures are of high quality, but they're repetitive (even if you're a Maserati fanatic, how many lovingly photographed close-ups of the Maserati trident badge do you need) and they omit a lot of interesting models -- the saloons are particularly neglected. It's not clear for whom this book is intended. There's not enough information to constitute either a history or a buyer's guide, and if all you want is pretty pictures, there are other books that provide them and more content to go with them."
1,cheap camera,"Nice large 7"" monitor. Camera heats up and gets condensation inside which makes viewing foggy. Nice system bad camera. Called Manufacturer who said they are working on a new camera."
2,Less than what I expected,"I added this sub to my Kenwood head unit which drives 4 jbl (5.5) speakers. After reading the reviews online, I opted for this all in one unit due to space constraints in my standard pickup cab. The unit fits nicely, but that's just about the only positive thing I can say. Although the sub does add some bass at low to mid-low volume levels, I believe even the casual user will be dissatisfied with this unit operating at midrange or higher volume levels. I find myself constantly turning down the sub's volume level because of distortion. Lastly, the frequency response for this unit is rated at 35-150 Hz, but I honestly don't believe the speaker reaches down to that 35Hz. The stock system in my Monte Carlo which is rated at 35Hz too, blows this unit away in every aspect to include reaching down to grab and reproduce those lows. Do yourself a favor and shop around a little more."
2,Bad choice for me.,"Obviously after paying to have a professional install for a new head unit, 60x4 amp, 4 door speakers and XM...this unit did not compliment the other items very well at all. It will probably suffice standing alone with factory equipment but with any amount of volume above 50% levels it distorts and was not worth the money spent for me. I was disappointed and am trying to return it."
3,Looks nice but...,"The installation of this subwoofer is not nearly as easy as it looks.If you have an aftermarket head unit, everything is easy.However, if you are intending to install this in a late-model car with factory stereo, beware! Many new cars (including my 2007 Nissan Versa) have systems that monitor line voltage. If the head unit is disconnected from power, the system triggers a fault in the air bag system, requiring a diagnostic and reset from the dealership. Also, cutting the speaker leads to tap for subwoofer input could void your warranty. Do your research before purchasing this product. You may want to consider hiring a pro to install it for you. Until I decide what to do, this sub will stay in the box."
4,Sound better than expected. Recommended if you are over 30.,"My 25 yr old son had a 500 watts MTX amp driving a 12 inch Solo Baric subwoofer in his Camero so I really do appreciate good bass. I managed to install this mini sub right behind the driver seat in my 2000 Corvette so I had zero loss of trunk space. The sub hits harder than expected but sounded slightly boomy and harsh at high volume compared to my son's system. I suspect the 75 watts amp is underpowered. Kenwood advertises this sub as 150 watts but that's peak or maximum power and not RMS power. At medium volumes (which most people over thirty listens to), it sounds great so this sub will compliment any system. In my opinion, if you need the trunk space and you are over 30, then you will like this sub. Be aware that the location of the sub must be close to you to be effective. I once located the sub in my trunk and the bass drops off significantly."
4,nice product for the price,"subwoofer-Base was $100.00 less than other sites. Glad I did not pay 250.00 for the item, it is worth the 150.00 I paid."
2,It's not Score Four,"As Score Four (Four Score) is no longer made, I thought this would be a good substitute. The LARGE beads are placed way too close together, making it difficult to place them on the pegs and difficult to see what colors are placed where. I have small hands and fingers, so anyone with bigger hands and fingers would probably have an even more difficult time. I purchased the game for my fourth grade class, and the larger bead size might make it more difficult for my students to lose the beads (Four Score beads are smaller). The game itself is excellent for developing logic skills, planning skills, and observation skills. One really needs to pay attention to win."
4,"Fun, but can be over fast","This is really quite fun, although it can end quickly. Kind of like tic-tac-toe, if you always start the same, the game often follows the same path as last time, yielding the same results as last time. This is the only drawback. It's fun, though, to strategize; try and force your opponent to make a move they don't want to make so you can win. My ten-year-old figured this one out in a hurry and beat me on only the third game!!"
4,My five-year old loves it!,"My daughter received this as a gift for her 5th birthday and she loves it. And I love it because she's dancing during her TV-time rather than sitting on the couch! Great, great gift!Side note: We have a similar product that came with a ballet bar, floor mat and video (not Disney). It's awful! The video is boring and makes no sense (my daughter has watched it once in four months). I'm not a huge Disney fan, but this video is much more engaging than other products on the market."
5,Very Fun!,"My daughter received this as a Xmas gift and LOVES it. It comes with an invitation to the ball, a wand that changes according to the story (3 different toppers)and other dress up accessories. ""Bella"" is a younger girl that takes then thru the story of Disney's Cinderella with dance moves. My daughter also got the glass slippers that are an option and they add to the fun of it. You can hear her dancing through the whole house LOL!"
4,FANTANSTIC DANCE MUSIC,"I had my doubts,but the DVD is fantanstic,the young lead actress is great at getting the childs attention,the musiz is wonderful.Only one down side to the set,the magical wand uses batteries,we have gone thru 6 in 24 hours.Make sure you have lots of AAA batteries on hand."
3,not worth the money,My daughter loves the wand and the mat is used when she wants to color or paint. The video goes too fast and she didn't really enjoy it.
1,NOT STAINLESS !,"These skewers are NOT stainless as advertised! Put a magnet to them and they will attract it. Stainless would not. After contacting the Outset company about this, they admitted that they were not ""pure"" stainless and would not comment further. After washing they also rusted in spots."
1,Unsafe,"These are all metal, no handles and the package was damaged as it was in a box that was entirely too small."
1,"remix, masters","Mario Winans is a remixing lame a$$watch ""Sleepwalkers"" the movie....he copied the song from the sound track16. Boadicea, is the same as ""I Don't Want To Know""he stole it from ""sleepwalkers"" the soundtrack, how lame.."
1,Boring,Sounds like a Carl Thomas Reject.The Fugees already rocked this whole Groove before with Ready or Not&the Enya sample as well.the sentiments of the Lyrics are decent but the Singing&straight jacking of the Music is tired&Played out for me.
1,"This is for the sissies, simply for the sissies. . .",This song sucks. Just a bunch of whining and whimpering and being in denial. Repeating the same trite chorus over and over and over again. It's soooo annoying! Whoever told Mario Winans that he could sing told him a bold faced lie. Enough already!
1,Save your money!,"These vector ""smart"" units are useless. I've had one for 3 yrs now and not ONCE has it charged a battery. I took the initial unit back since all it did was give me ""fault errors"". Got the new unit, went to use it a month later, same fault error ""F03 Open Cell"" telling me the battery needed replaced. I have tried to use this garbage unit on at least TEN separate occasions the past couple of years....F03 fault errors every time! Funny thing is, my buddies old ""not smart"" Schumacher charged the batteries right up. Reading some reviews, i noticed someone figured out these units wont charge a battery if it is under 4 volts. WTH? A battery charger that wont charge dead batteries??? Save yourself the headache, avoid this company at all costs.."
3,sonicare mini toothbrush heads,"is a good toothbrush head for me, but I only received one instead of 2! What should I do?"
1,amateur hour,this is basically a comic book. no plot. ill conceived attempts at dramatic action. cliche upon cliche. i really can not understand that there was only one other negative review.
3,Nice Read,"Captivating story, some well developed characters. The racial nuances were inessential and sometimes irritating. I wouldn't buy any more of the series though."
1,"Bad, horrible language!!","I cannot believe I am the first out of 50 or so reviews to rate this book with a poor review. I could not finish it, but wanted to know the end of the story. So I skipped to the end, and tried to ignore the ""F"" word that PERMEATES this book. So, supposedly good story line, but this book gets an F itself in grade, because it is SO full of awful swearing."
4,Loved it.,"I'll admit I didn't think much of the first couple of pages. The action seemed too easy for Hannibal to execute, and I was worried the story might end up being a little glib.However, within a chapter or so, I found the characters growing on me, and I thoroughly enjoyed being along for the ride during Hannibal's challenges, sharing his successes, plus enduring his failures ... and failings. I also very much liked the crew he brought together around him.All in all a very enjoyable romp ... and in a way I'm fortunate to have read this prequel now, before reading the first two novels in the series. That way, by sheer luck on my part, I get to enjoy the character in order of timeline."
4,A 21st Century Shaft,"Cool under pressure, doesn't back down from a challenge, isn't always right, but he doesn't give up.This book has a good tempo, a good read. I can't wait to get the next in the series. I gave it only 4 stars because of the editing."
4,Troubleshooter is A-one on my list,"This is an engrossing story of a man who is not exactly what he seems. I found the book easy to read and engaging, but there are a few slow spots. I hope other readers will enjoy this book as much as I did."
4,Really enjoyed it!,"This wasn't exactly a mystery, but it was a very good action-filled story. The kind where you love rooting for the good guy. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Those that are familiar with martial arts would probably love it!"
4,"Good, not great",I enjoyed the book but I isn't on my top ten. A little disjointed and contrived. Good reading on the airplane or when you want something you can put down.
4,Like this character,"Great character, this Hannibal Jones. Look forward to reading more. Good guys vs bad guys, I thought it was well written."
3,The Trouble shooter,This book was not interesting until it got towards the middle of the book The beginning was to detailed on unimportant information that had nothing to do with the actual story.
3,like watching TV,"Easy reading, enjoyable story. Like watching a fun TV show. Relationships are a little weak (more tell than show), and I thought the writing was sort of simplistic as well. But the plot was interesting enough to keep me reading the whole thing at least."
2,This is a story about a guy who moves into a house.,"Okay, maybe it is not that dull, and since I got the Kindle version for free it wasn't a huge waste of my money. Still, there's not a much more to this book than a series of confrontations over who is the rightful owner of a run down building in a poverty stricken neighborhood in Washington, DC. That gets kind of repetitive. The characters have potential, but outside of the protagonist (Hannibal Jones) are never truly developed enough to make them interesting. The neighborhood kid, Monty, a bit of a cliche, seems to be a primary motivation for Hannibal's efforts to clean up the neighborhood, yet he 's almost completely absent from the last 3rd of the book. The mob guys standing in the way don't seem too bright, and the final resolution of the conflict feels somewhat contrived. The writing is hit and miss, some of the metaphors just don't work as well as the author thinks they do."
5,Favorite Hannibal Jones - So Far,"I loved this Hannibal Jones story. If Austin Camacho ever decides to give up writing, he should set up his easel. The descriptions of the people and places are amazingly vivid."
2,AND OR 123,This just need hold my attention to the point as a page turner. Good Samaritan and Vigilanty rolled into one.
3,Starts Strong but Drags On,"The city of the title is Montreal, and I picked this up specifically because I was going on vacation there for a week and wanted to get some of the flavor of the city. As it worked out, I ended up reading it while there instead, which was actually a kind of cool--although by the end I was exhausted and ready for it to end. It's a thriller/procedural, teaming a loner French-Canadian veteran police detective with a young English-Canadian, with the resulting sparks predictably followed by mutual respect. The plot revolves around gang-warfare between rival biker gangs (yes, this sounds hokey, but I gather it's based on real events) who are tied into international crime circles. By then end, it's all a bit much, but still worth reading if you're interested in Montreal. BTW- John Farrow is a pseudonym for Canadian literary talent Trevor Ferguson."
3,The City is the Most Likeable Character,"I read this book over the Xmas holidays and we had warm weather, but reading about the cold in Montreal made me feel like I wanted to visit. I have studied recent Canadian history from newspapers and this book adds a more personal touch. My main difficulty was that the main character is not that likeable and neither are any of the others."
1,These monitors have known issues--don't buy!!,"Read up on the web and you'll find that these monitors die after about one year. Mine did, and Gateway isn't doing anything about it! After I started looking, I found that many people are having the same problem with this Gateway monitor and other Gateway flat panel monitors. They just go dead! Expensive monitors should not be disposable. Don't make the same mistake I did. I'll never buy anything from Gateway again."
5,what a dreamy little pop album,"I've seen thats it's pretty standard for everyone who takes the time to review something to be in love with it, thus so much stuff gets a full five stars. This little cutie pie of a cd deserves it. All the songs have an adorable pop beat, always up tempo, and the whats-her-name singer has the cutest lilting and feminine voice I've heard in a while. I think 'stupid boy' and 'rocketship' are the best by far and full of lyrical pop sensibilities. This is definately crush-worthy stuff and worth the long shipping time."
2,Why does everybody else love this book? Just average...,"I really looked forward to reading this book given the great reviews. I just didn't get it. There were parts that I had to flip through because they were so cliche. The ""secret"" is so obvious from the first chapter, and I didn't understand why she didn't tell Miles the truth before the last few pages. I am not a fan of angst in books just for angst sake, and there was plenty here. They didn't hate each other and they didn't try to get along, they just seemed to work really hard and misunderstand the other and being at cross purposes. And through the whole thing, I just didn't feel the love between these 2 people. And the mine and the mean sister and the mom were all really poorly written. I am still really confused about how this has so many great reviews, and more than a few mentions as the ""best romance ever"". Really? I thought about giving it 1 star, but decided that would be unfair since I did make it to the end, though barely."
4,Very Nice,"This is a very good story and I liked Miles and Olivia's personalities and interaction right from the get-go. The storyline was pretty unique, also, in regards to the Bryan situation.I have read a few Sutcliffe stories now and my only complaint is that, while they are the standard length of an historical romance, somehow they really draw me in but then seem to suddenly move too quickly with too little interaction or romance. It's hard to explain. Maybe she tries to cover too large a time period because, about halfway through I start feeling like I'm getting a Cliff Notes version of the love story. For that reason I gave it a 4. Good story though."
4,Cheesy (but good!) read,"This book is a little on the cheesy side, as bodice rippers sometimes tend to be, but it is interesting and enjoyable. My biggest complaint with the book is the writing, as the author referred to the Earl improperly, calling him Earl _______, instead of Lord _______. Not a big deal, but it was irksome!"
1,FAKE PICTURE...,"read description, picture is about a nitrous purge kit... but it's not what you are paying for.. carefull.."
4,Excellent Reference,This book was the best reference I had while preparing for the NBAA Certified Aviation Manager's exam in 2004.It is also a very useful read for the business executive who must deal with an aviation department but has little experience in that particular field.
5,Business aviation,The sine qua non of books on this topic; full of essential information and insider knowledge
1,Selling It Now,"I am in management for a major airline, among the most profitable in the world and consistently rated the best. Opened this book, browsed through and decided to sell it. It certainly covers a lot of ground in terms of opening your eyes to managing in aviation, but alas, only for non-aviation experienced personnel. There is mostly only mentions of what is there to run but nothing on how to run something. A long list of LISTS practically on what you need to run and then nothing that puts them together. Readability is not too pretty either. Dry style and lack of visuals will surely make this look like your college engineering textbooks, the ones you dreaded reading."
3,Non-Fiction,"A really high level textbook, this one, you'd have to know some other basics to understand what this book is going on about.A text only for this with enough mathematical grounding to want to get into this sort of sampling and analysis methodology.Not particularly accessible at all below that."
3,"good product, hard to install","This product worked great, once we got it in. The instructions were incorrect, and we had to make 2 trips to the Home Depot to get tools that weren't specified, so the installation took a long time. Now that it's up, it's very solid and works great."
3,Good mount,"I used this mount to hang a 42"" LG plasma. The instructions were not as clear as my peerless mount. They didn't explain which bolts to use and when I went to the OmniMount website and downloaded the instructions they were different but explained the installation better."
4,Bracket a sanp,The install was eazy enough. I tryed to over think it but made it through. The instruction were a little confusing for the small amount that had to be done. The lag bolts that are used to connect to the wall seemed to be a little over kill but I guess for a heavier set it may be needed. Hanging the the set was eazy and I did it about four times with help. The ability to lock the set to the wall is nice. I would use it again it looks good and is sturdy.
1,Be Careful: Avoid the Top Slots,"There is a real problem with these mounts unless you buy the right one. I have seen 2 types of Omnimount vertical mounting bars. One has holes for the top screw that goes into the TV and a slot for the lower screw. The other type, like this one pictured, has 2 slots. With the 2 slot model, the screws have to be really torqued down to stop the TV from sliding down because of the weight of the TV. The potential to strip out the threads on the TV's back panel is very high on a heavier TV (>32""). Look for the mount that has holes for the top screw. On a light TV it may not matter, but why Omnimount uses this for a 32+ inch TV is beyond me."
5,Great item. Best service possible. Thanks.,The item arrived as advertised. It was easy to mount and very pleasing for the purpse intended.
2,Nice looking...function not too good...,"it looks like a much nicer piece of AV equipment when compared to creatives after market av cable...however if purchasing for more than mere aesthetics, this may not be the cable of choice. Ive tried using it on two seperate zens with 2 seperate docking stations and the cord does not hold in place and video fades in and out sporadically. If the zen sits perfect it works as it should. Kind of a hassle. Looks nice though"
5,A Musical Journey,"There are two good reasons to own this CD. The first is that it traces key events and themes in Lewis and Clark's epic journey across the frontier. If you are at all familiar with what was at stake for the Corps of Expedition, the ordeal's they faced, and the emotional roller coaster the men and Sacagewa experienced you will appreciate this album. There is above all a very moving expression of the sentiments that Clark's slave York may have experienced.A more important reason to own this album is that it is musically upbeat and exhilerating. I saw David Walburn perform this musical score at Glacier National Park, while doing some light Lewis and Clark research. From the moment I heard it and every time I have listened to it on CD since I have been uplifted. Mike"
5,Deck Garden,"I had to move my garden from the ground, because of deer and did not want to erect fences, up to my deck and into containers. This product coupled with a timer watering system keeps my containers watered all summer. Eight ports provide plenty of feeds with t and y adaptors to further add capacity on a line. All ports are adjustable and can even be shut off if you need less than 8 feeds. A trip to the hardware store may be required to get the required hose and pipe fittings to attach to your timer or hose. For the plumbing challenged, bring it with you and test the fittings before you purchase. It should only cost a few dollars to get all you need. Then get your tubing and zip ties to make it all look neat and professional. The 8 port manifold is perfect along with a timer is a perfect setup. Recommend only to use outdoors."
5,Intense yet subtle masterpiece of woolfson,"This album,a afterthought of APP scholaric musical efforts,together with woolfson's passion for freud and his work combine for a full range of musical diversities ranging from the massive almost physical rock of ""I am a mirror"" and the dreamy ""dora"" to the pointed sarkasm of ""sects therapy"" and the grusome ""nobody loves you better than me"".""little hans"" by veteran graham dye is a wonderful piece which bonds together lovely tune with chilling byepasses like:""he scared of the horses might byte..."" Briefly;a must have for App fans,PRock listeners And alltogether good music lovers."
4,A must have for APP fans,"I am a long time APP fan. I had been aware of this recording for some time when I finally was able to obtain a copy here. I was reluctant at first to pay the high price, but it was well worth the money. Though there are some throwaway songs which sound a bit too much like Broadway, what's left is probably the best APP music since Eye in the Sky and Turn of a Friendly Card. The first 3 tracks are particularly good and I find myself listening to them again and again. 3 of the instrumentals are also reminded me of some of the best Powell work. A must have."
5,Little-known gem,"Rich, rewarding, and far more diverse than the last half-dozen Alan Parsons Project discs. The inclusion of female vocalists (""Don't Let the Moment Pass"") will make you wonder why Parsons & Woolfson kept the project a boys-only club for so long.If you like the showtune stuff here, seek out Woolfson's ""Gaudi"" (not the 35-minute APP album, but a musical Woolfson based on it... published by WEA Germany and pretty hard to find)"
4,The Missing Link,"This album could easily be referred to as the ""The Long Lost Alan Parsons Album"". Released in 1990 and composed and engineered after the last official APP ""Gaudi"" in 1986, this album truly demonstrates the creative force of Eric Woolfson. Although the random musical tracks reduce my review to four out of five stars, the album is exceptional. The title track ""Freudiana"" has become one of my all time favorite Eric Woolfson lead vocals on par with ""Eye In The Sky"" ""Time"" and ""Don't Answer Me"". ""Little Hans"" and ""Dora"" are also exceptional. I really wish Eric and Alan would work together again. How about ""The Parsons & Woolfson Project""?!"
3,Very Sturdy - 22 month old Toddler loves it!,My husband was able to assemble the fire engine bed within an hour (including putting on the stickers) .He used a power drill. My 22 month old son enjoys his new bed. The feature that i like the most - is that the sides of the truck - are high so i don't have to worry about him falling out. That was the number one selling factor for us. I previously bought a regular wooden toddler bed but had to return it - the rails where not high enough - my son would roll right off the bed.The only reason why i rated this item a 4 was due to the price $$$
3,I also had big problems with this bed's construction,"Like the previous reviewer. I noted that the screws that were supplied to hold the frame of the bed together were not nearly long enough to secure it. In fact, they did not even penetrate the plastic, and when we lifted the side wall it completely fell apart. I wonder if there was an incorrect shipment. We even used a power drill. The bed is adorable, however, and I am hoping that with some new screws it can be made safe. If not, we will be returning it."
5,Best Toddler Bed on the Market,"We first purchased the race car bed, but found that our son could easily roll off the sides. We then purchased the fire truck bed and it has now gone through both of our sons. With the high sides, there is little fear of your child ever falling off the bed while sleeping. One warning: the night light on top goes through batteries very quickly, despite shutting itself off after 15 minutes. Ours eventually stopped working even with fresh batteries. I e-mailed the Step 2 company and they sent us a new one free of charge. Excellent Customer Service!"
5,Really cute bed,We bought this bed for our 17mos old son after he learned to climb out of his crib. He LOVES it and climbes in and out of it from every end and every way possible. Highly recommend it!
3,Not so safe,"I purchased this bed last December as a Christmas present for my 2 year old son. He loves to play in it but still prefers to sleep in his crib. Yesterday while playing in it, the bed completely fell apart and when I attempted to put it back together I realized that the necessary screws that hold the bed together weren't even long enough to attach the bed properly. I am extremely disappointed in this product and I have e-mailed Step2 and am waiting for a response. Parents be careful, and make sure if you do already own this bed that everything fits correctly. I thought my bed did, luckily my son was unharmed."
1,Dangerous - be careful!,"I have twin sons who just turned 3 I bought one this bed about 6 months ago. He really likes it, and I WAS happy with my choice. My son is small for his age only about 25lbs, and yet the support board slips out about once a week. My son ends up sleeping on a caved in mattress. Then for the SECOND TIME since we bought this bed I wake to son my crying ""Oh no fire truck"" Because the bed COMPLETELY fell apart. The screw ends were facing up out of the plastic, and the frame pieces were on the floor. I am not sure what exactly caused this to happen, but any bed that falls apart on a 3 year old TWICE is a piece of junk!"
3,"easily readable, masculine styling","...Update after wearing the watch daily for 12 months, I'm very happy with the purchase - no problems to report. It's durable, keeps accurate time, and the clasp on the band is easy to manage and stays latched. It deserves 4 stars but I can't edit that rating. Original review: The watch has a big, stylish face that's easily readable day or night. It's a bit heavier than expected and the band needs to be relatively snug to keep the face in place on your wrist. Also the metal band is nearly 3/4"" so the watch has a masculine appearance. Keeps accurate time but the crystal scratched within the first week of use. The crystal on my Tissot watch is unscratched after two years continuous use."
3,"Great Watch, not so GReaT Seller ...","I have this watch in several colors and absolutely love them. Purchased this model through Amazon. The watch was sent to me with origional packaging, but the protective sleeves for the watch band and cover for the watch face were removed. Not only were they removed, the protective products along with the manufacture tag were laying with the watch inside the box. Amazon must be receiving returns and not checking them out, just sending items off to the next buyer. Oh well, the price is good, but will be weary of my purchases in the future."
4,"Good, sturdy watch","This is a good, sturdy watch and is easy to read, no matter if it is light or dark."
4,Works well,"I bought this unit 5 years ago and have not had any problems. It is on its second battery but that is to expected since they only last for 3 to 5 years. It keeps the power clean and shuts down the system just like it was designed. Just remember to properly choose a UPS that's appropriate for the system and/or other equipment you have. This one is only 300 watts so don't expect a high run time when you have a high-end system plugged into it. If you want to keep your computer, monitor, and peripherals up for 30 minutes after a power outage go get a 2200VA unit."
2,good but!,I bought product mainly to back up power for my cable modem and wireless phone which also uses cable modem. Unfortunately it has a 30 minute maximum time that it stays on after a power failure. I thought my 15 watt (total) devices would stay up for hours with a 550va backup. Contacted the company and their answer was sorry thats the way it works.
4,Simple Yet Useful,"It's funny how such a simple device can be so useful. I am unable to bend more than a slight amount. The twisted device on the end of this stick is perfect for a man like me to pull up pants. I have one of these on a hook on the wall in all three of my bathrooms because I'm unable to pull up my underwear or pants after using the bathroom. These are perfect for that use, and take up no room. As probably is true of others on here, it never occurred to me that there were so many useful devices for crippled people - until I became crippled and needed them!"
5,"Sturdy, perfect.","I bought this for my boyfriend, who has a stick like this in every room of the house. I had never bought one for him before, but he loves this one. It's exactly what his other sticks look like; great for the price."
2,Duro-Med Dressing Aid,I bought this to help me after hip replacement surgery get off the anti-embolism stockings (they are like support hose). The end for that use is already bending after 5 days and I assume would break if I needed to use it much longer. All it consists of is piece of doweling with a white-coated cup hook on one end and white-coated clothing hook on the other end. The black caps are purely decorative. The cup hook is for pulling things up (like loose socks). The other end is to help get things like my stockings off without bending over.
5,dressing stick,"Great price, quick ship. Used after lumbar fusion surgery to snag things off floor. Not heavy duty but priced right for the quality."
5,Looks simple - but it's perfect,"I got this for my Dad, who recently had a broken arm, and also has difficulty standing to dress. He likes it very much, says it helps him dress much more easily. It's a simple gadget but must have been designed by someone in similar circumstances - it's a really good aid."
2,Just Okay,"The stick is very thin (too thin) and very light (too light) and shorter than I had hoped and needed. Made of raw unfinished wood and not sanded very smooth. A basic cup hook on one end for pulling zippers (a little large and at a bad angle for some zipper styles) and a plastic covered wire hook on the other end. The hook does not have any real ""grab"" for pulling up jeans or sweatpants and the pants slip off. The service dog then laughs and takes over for the stick. The quality is on the ultra-cheap and looks horrible in my bedroom and in my life.It also arrived wrapped very tight in lots of plastic wrap wrapped around it and tied into knots and then wrapped in tape. Apparently some sort of sinister plan to keep anyone from actually getting to the product... not to mention an obvious difficulty to those intended to be served by the product."
2,best for clothing with belt loops,"I didnt' realize when I bought this item but learned later at rehab and by experience that this item is best to do things such as pull up pants with belt loops. Since I must wear a huge hard brace around my middle after my surgery for 3 months, I am wearing only sweats and T shirts while I need the product so it wasn't a great fit for me. But it would be great for a man who uses pants with a belt etc. It is also useful for pushing and pulling things around I suppose."
1,Disappointed,I have had this blender for about 3 years now and have used it very sparingly (1-2x per 6 months) for an occasional smoothie. Pulled it out of the cupboard today and when i pressed the button to blend all i got was a click. I am pretty sure the motor burnt out on it.... for a $60 blender i am pretty disappointed.... i had to use my friends Oster $20 blender as that one has still been kicking for over 5 years.... all i must say is buyer beware!
2,Not pleased,The main frame flashes lights and pauses in every use.The ice blade corroded after a few months of use.
1,Lousy product,"Motor burnt out on it after 3 days. Very dissapointed, now I have to go through the warranty process of getting a new one or getting my money back."
1,VTECH T2326 - Problems with 2.4ghz,VTECH T2326 - Problems with 2.4ghz. This is not good phone if you have a Wireless Router with 2.4ghz. Check your wireless router and buy this. Best use the Dect6.0 technology - if you have a wireless router with 2.4ghz.Instead of 2.4ghz with lot of interfernce of Wireless equipments ( modems/routers) - best for DECT6.0 technology.Vtech-CS6209 - DECT6.0 technology is good . OR You can go for any brands with DECT6.0 digital technology.I struggled with this Phone without knowing this is 2.4ghz and my Wireless Router also 2.4ghz.Now i got this Vtech-CS6209 - DECT6.0 - which is good. No interfernce of any modem/routers.
3,A book that makes you think,"I purchased this book as a seminary requirement for a class on Theodicy taught by the author. I am not an advocate of Freewill Theism, but enjoy a book that forces me to think through my convictions. A Case for Freewill Theism is a short book but not the easiest read; it is written in ""philosophicize."" I found the book helped me examine my view of God's attributes. It also helped me recognize how others answer questions about God's response to evil in this world."
2,OUT OF DATE,THIS BOOK WENT OUT OF DATE 10 DAYS AFTER I RECEIVED IT. A NEWER VERSION WAS ABOUT TO BE RELEASED HOWEVER I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS. HAD I KNOWN I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS VERSION. BUYER BEWARE.
2,Rakim is amazing...but don't lie to yourself.,"I wanted this album to be what I expected...The world waited from ""Don't Sweat The Technique"" which isone of the greatest albums ever. Lyrics/Concepts...he predictedthe WTC bombing on Casualties of War. The voice of Rais trade mark.18th Letter. This album had 4 dope tracks at best. Themagic wasn't there. I'm one of the biggest Rakim fans on theplanet, and I just can't act like I felt this album. I heardthe budget for it was a mill too. The production was soft, andthe beats don't match Rakim's intensity.People say Eric B was wack. I think Eric B was ok-but at leasthis uptempo boom bap ideas work with Rakim's delivery. No classicsexcept ""Who Is God"" maybe ""NY NY"".I'm really dissapointed with this, The Master and the 2010 album."
4,"All In All, its good","My friend who hates rap gave this Cd to me. He was going to torch it but he remembered that I like rap, so he saved them for me. This was the first of four Cds I listened to because I was familiar with Rakim. I thought it was a good CD. I mean theres a few I don't really care for such as It's Been A Long Time. That songs OK, but its not the best. I also don't prefer the skits and this album is full of them. I just ignore those and listen to the songs. But Rakim is a great MC. So if your looking for a good rap CD, go ahead and pick it up. Youll like it. Again, not a perfect CD but it should hold ya for a while."
3,don't forget his projects with Eric B.,one of rak's solo projects. good good good. some rightfully and justifiably call this man the best ever. now are you still hesitant?
3,THE MASTER IS RIHGT,"WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY ABOUT RAKIM.BACK IN 1986 HE WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME.NOW NEAR 2000,HE STILL IS AHEAD OF HIS TIME.LYRICALY,RA IS OUT OF THIS WORLD.COMPOSE WORDS LIKE NO ONE ELSE.ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS ALBUM WOULD BE THE BEATS.BESIDES- FLOW 4 EVER,I BE ON THE MIC,AND HOW I GET DOWN THE BEATS START TO FALL.IF THE BEATS WAS ON POINT THIS ALBUM WOULD BE A 5 PLUS STAR.I LOVE RAKIM,HE AND KRSONE ARE THE GREATEST.BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO COP THIS CD."
5,the best!,"I have been so frustrated with the ever-blander Vlasic relish, and this is dynamite! Great sweet relish tang with a bit of a kick."
2,Linksys WUSB54G Wireless-G USB Adapter,"This unit comes with very Buggy software. It doesn't work well with WinXP. It needs a version upgrade. It also could use a firmware upgrade. Neither existed at the time I purchased it. The range is also less than that of ""B"".I have gone back to a WUSB11 which works much better on my wife's XP machine along with a Wap54g with speed booster. Since that machine has a NIC anyway I may try a wireless G ethernet adapter instead and get better range."
1,Poor sensitivity is a killer in this product,"I got a USB version of a wireless adapter so that I could easily put it on the roof of my car for war driving. I also figured with the pop up antenna it would be more sensitive. No such luck. Outside of 20 feet from the access point, the device is very unreliable. Even inside 20 feet it isn't all that great. I don't recommend this product."
5,Old reliable.,"I purchased this for a family member. As long as you run it through a 2.0 port, it works quite well, bearing in mind that it's a G-band adapter of course."
3,still useable,"I still use this device to work on people's computers that have Vista or lower installed. It works great with XP. It doesn't work with Win 7 however. I haven't been able to get the software to work with the adapter on 7. Maybe there is someone that has better success than I have had. The adapter is still very, very useable."
2,Signal Fluctuates,The signal and speed fluctuates constantly! I dont think this device is as powerful as a PCI wireless ethernet card. If you can - go the wireless PCI card route. I bought this for the portability and it is OK for that - but it drops connections for no reason and you have to reboot or disconnect/reconnect the USB cable for it to reattach to the preferred network. I also have a Linksys 54g pcmcia card and Linksys 54g pci card - both work a lot better than the usb wireless device.
1,This adapter not compatable with Windows 7,"I have used this adapter with windows XP and then Windows vista. I have bought newbasic Dell desktop for my son. After alot of frustration trying to getonline, I find this adapter is not compatable with Windows 7. Linksys offera few ideas but they do not work. Technician said I need newer adapter model!"
5,I like,This compact dynamo has never disappointed me yet. Very good buy compared to the electronic mega stores....
1,Unable to set up my router,I bought the Lynksys Router and was unable to set up my wireless network. This couldn't have been more confusing.
5,Works as described,I bought this for my daughter's computer when she moved into a house with a wireless network. Easy to install...just plugged it into a usb port....and it worked.** I'd definitely recommend it.
1,Simply does not work with Windows XP. Buy at your own risk!,"The signal received by the WUSB54G installed on three different Windows XP machines flunctuates quite a bit, from very good to very low, and at which point it drops the connection. Other wifi client devices in the same area suffer no such phenomenon, using the same WRT54G router.Based on the comments from other users of this device, this is an inherent defect of the WUSB54G. I recommend that Amazon not sell this item any more, as it simply does not work with Windows XP (despite Linksys claims that it does).This is not my first experience with a Linksys product that simply does *not* work! However, it will definitely be my last."
2,Lots of problems with XP,"It seems to work fine with 2000, but when I hooked it up to a computer with XP the connection keeps droppping. I thank the hardware is fine and once they get the bugs out of the software it will be a good unit."
1,Waste of money,"In the past 2 months since I purchased this product for my family's desktop PC it has never worked well. One hour it works, the next hour does not. As I write this (from my laptop), I have been on hold with Linksys Tech Support for 35 minutes trying to get help from their self promoted ""award winning technical support line."" DO NOT buy this product; spend the extra money and get something better."
4,"Good, Compact but like all adapters, not affordable.","This is a great product. It is small, not that bad looking, and is Compatible with Vista. I just wish that it had a removable antenna and a lower price."
1,poor compatability,I could not get synched with the Speedstream wireless modem router supplied by my phone company. 3 call to Linksys tech help produced no more than a temporary on&off connection. I'm going to hardwire my computer after spending over two hundred dollars on Linksys wireless equipment.
3,ok price poor,purchased two items and was not given any break on shipping and handling fees. won't purchase another thing from this company. On E-bay you can call the seller or email them and get a more realistic cost.
5,It does its job.,"I bought this to use for my laptop, which has a horrible internal wireless LAN adapter, and it's great!It's incredibly light, not too big, gives me excellent signal around my house, and is a snap to install.I didn't face any problems that other reviewers mentioned, and best of all, I got it for only 15 bucks.Can't really go wrong with it."
5,LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!,"I already use the Linksys wireless system with my DELL notebook computer. I purchased a SONY VAIO desktop computer, installed the software, hooked this wireless adapter to the unit, and VIOLA!! instant Internet access.I haven't had any problems with this adapter. It works like a dream---to me."
2,It always connect to our neighbor's router and not working,"We are in an industrial park with many neighbors. One of our neighbor using a unknown name router with security on. This adapter running on XP always trying to connect to the secured router first, even that has nothing to do with us.Obviously, this adapter can see MAC addersses of all the routers. But its software does not allow you to specify which MAC address you want to select and connect, rather is always select the secure one first. Contacted Linksys support for the issue. They told me go ahead turn on your router's security. We do not want to turn on security, since we want to use our router to provide free services for our visiting customers. Linksys support told us no security, no connection. Why? Why can't they in their software allowing people to select exactly which router to connect?"
1,"Unreliable, slow and no tech support. Do not buy.","I replaced my Belkin Wireless-B USB adapter with this one (I am using these with a Belkin Wireless-G router). Big mistake -- transfers are nearly twice as slow and the signal is lost intermittently. I tried to contact Linksys to address these issues by phone, waited on hold for over two hours, and was finally disconnected. I then sent a detailed e-mail to tech support describing my problems, but received no response.The Belkin-b is cheaper, faster and more reliable than this adapter, and Belkin has great tech support, if needed."
1,Worst add on ever invented. Period.,"I have been computing since 1983 and I have installed all types of devices and software on all types of computers. I currently have a Linksys Router on my home network. I have tried several times in the past to use this WUSB54G - ""POS"". First of all it is not plug and play for sure. You are supposed to install the software first before plugging this ""thing"" in. Wait until the setup software tells you to plug it in and then if you're lucky it might work on your system. I have tried to use it from WIN 98 to Vista and got it installed one time on a computer and it worked for a short while. Too many other easy install and plug and play devices out there to fool around with this one. Just try finding a copy of the installation disk to set up the WUSB54G should you loose it. Look elsewhere for a solution for your wireless needs."
4,"It works, but only with a Buffalo Router","I tried this gadget with Linksys and other routers. It was intermittant and irritating. The problem is with the router. Get a Buffalo router, and the USB Linksys WUSB54G will work perfectly. Comes with good software and easy setup."
2,Don't buy this.,"I got this with a WRT54GL router and it stinks. My 5+ year old USB D-link G adapter works better then this.Pros: Features.Cons: Over heats, Stinks like burning electronics, half the bandwidth at same signal strength as my other USB adapter. WAYYYY WAYYY over priced.Other: I can't believe I spend $50 on this. Don't buy this thing what ever you do. There are much better adapters out there that are cheaper and more powerful."
2,NOT IMPRESSED WITH LINKSYS CUSTOMER SUPPORT,I've sent my Linksys WUSB54G back to Amazon for a refund. My Linksys was not working properly with my 2Wire router and when I called Linksys customer support I spent hours on the phone with individuals who could not understand my problem and could not fix the problem. I'm sure the Linksys customer service individuals ment well but we could not fix the problem. One of the biggest problems we had was that I speak and understand American English and the customer support people were speaking fairly good English but with a heavy Indian or other accent. If Linksys is going to market to the American English speaking customers they should have American English speaking customer service.
5,Dated but still the most stable.,"I have used the WUSB54G adapters almost since they were introduced, they install and configure easy and are very reliable, we have 8 of them running anywhere from 8-15 hours a day M-F and I have only had to replace 2 of them (to be fair the first one died because someone sat on it, breaking off the antenna)"
3,Buy something else,"Connection speed varies greatly, the most I ever get is 54mbps. Unreliable - sometimes it will not work for no reason. I have all the settings correct, yet it seems to have a mind of it's own. Difficult to set up. Takes a while to settle down after installation. What a waste of money."
2,Connection is flakey,I recently purchased 2 WUSB54G v 2 usb adapters for my WRT54G v2 router. These were flakey from the start when I installed them on my 2 Windows 2000 machines. One machine went into an instant looping blue screen IRQ conflict and the other machine seemed to connect to the wireless network on the third or 4th reboot. I ended up wiping both machines and reinstalling Windows 2000 and this solved some problems but created others. After much pain and suffering and calls to Linksys idiot tech support guys in Indiana who repeatedly ask the same questions I'm still unhappy. About half the time these adapters don't connect to the network succesfully on boot. Other times the adapters get stuck in a strange state where I cant release or renew the IP addresses. Even adding a range extender hasn't solved the problems.
2,Good until stand by....,"I, like you, were reading reviews on this device and saw mixed responses. Purchased the product 2 days ago and here's what I found;Device works great when you install the device and will continue to work correctly until you shut down your CPU or it goes to standby or sleep. After sleep mode or stand by, I had to manually assign the device an IP address then ""ping"" for test in the IPCONFIG. HASSLE and there's no way my wife could have figured this out. There is something not correct with the software for this device after you turn off your drivers.Spent 45 minutes on the 24 hour support from Lynksys and they couldn't figure the problem either so they said I have a OS problem. Funny.Today I purchased Motorola's version pn 512720-001-00 and have had no problems.Final comments, if you are running Windows XP and never plan to shut down your CPU or turn onto standby, this is a great product. For the 98% of us that send our CPU's to sleep, proceed with caution!"
1,NO NO NO NO,"I bought the Linksys WUSB54G Wireless-G USB Adapter for use with a Win XP laptop. The software installed but refused to run and just flashed a DLL error about every 10 seconds.I downloaded new software from the LinkSys website that turned out to be two versions OLDER than what shipped with the product.After finding several other people who had similar results and had posted about it on the internets, needless to say, I returned this product as defective."
4,Easy Install on VISTA - cable too short,"Install was incredibly simple on a new VISTA desktop... less than 2 minutes and I was on my home wireless net. The USB cable provided, however, is a bit too short to easily reach the top shelf of my computer desk. Overall, a great buy and I'd recommend it."
4,Wireless G,"The wireless G adapter works fine. It provides fast connection to my router. Installation is easy the only thing is to not install it before loading the software. Otherwise the computer will install it with default software that will work, but will conflict with the provided program. In the next session the adapter will not work. I reinstalled the adapter with the provided software and it has worked fine since."
1,terrible signal,I would definetly NOT recommend this product because the signal speed is low. For me it averages 60-80% signal and i am not that far away from my router! I would recommend to get a PCI one instead.
2,OK only if you have a strong signal,This device works well if you have a strong signal and little interference. I had to go to using a Netgear WPN111 to get a good connection all the time.
1,WUSB54GS Poor Product,"I read the reviews and trusted them on the Linksys products. The Wireless-G Router with speed booster, the USB Network adapter with Speed booster and the internal card with speed booster do not work as they were intended. They are great if you are 10 feet away. Any further and they do not have any signal. I've called Linksys support and they tried to help but cannot help. I even invested in antenna boosters and they do not work. I was told that I have interference. I want you to know that is a crock. I feel the products are inferior and I am sorry I ever trusted them. Do not waste your hard earned money on this JUNK!!!!!!!"
2,Could be more reliable...,"This network adapter installs without any problems on Windows XP but if you plan on doing a lot heavy networking, I would recommend something more reliable. Every time I unplug the adapter and restart the system, the driver unloads and I have to reload it from CD or copy the files to the local drive. The other problems I've encountered are poor speeds and frequent disconnects. It seems that when I'm doing a lot of heavy networking, the adapter freezes up and the connection drops. I'm not sure if Linksys has an update for this but it's really not robust enough for ""always on"" broadband internet."
3,Not TiVo friendly,"I originally purchased this item with the intention of using it with my TiVo to connect to my wireless router. Unfortunately, the WUSB54G would not work with TiVo, so I had to purchase the WUSB12 to use with the TiVo. However, I have been using the WUSB54G with the 2nd desktop in our household & it would great with our 54G Wireless router. Good Wireless USB adapter, but WILL NOT work with TiVo. :("
1,Lousy,"This worked ok for awhile but got progressivly worse. Doesn't want to connect to different networks, slow speeds, frequently drops the connection and even when it is connected often doesn't want to work properly. I've given up on it, worse than no connection at all! Got a Belkin, hope to god it works better than this piece of junk. Very dissatisfied with Linksys."
4,An Updated Old Reliable,Used the 11B version for our clients with desktop PCs at a couple of trailer parks. They are tough to get so I tried the 11G units and have found they work pretty darn good also. 800 feet with line of sight and 400 with a few obstructions.
5,good product,"This wireless adapter works. I have tried to save money with a cheaper unit, and ended up wasting time and money. This Linksys unit works flawlessly, the software loads fast and without trouble. I bought a second one for out other computer-again works great. I definitely recommend this unit."
3,Novice Nightmare,"The router installed with no problem, this USB adapter was not easy to install, driver installed just fine, but it would not recognize the router. My 1st phone call to a tech was a woman with a strong accent which I could not place, useless. Gave it one more shot before pure frustration would have made me return the adapter. My second call resulted in a very knowledgeable tech, she had me run upstairs and down 5 different times to configure both computers, but it was worth it, the speed and range surprised me. This is a good product, just lacking in good installation documentation."
1,No Driver for Win98SE!!,"Linksys doesn't bother to highlight the fact that it is the only USB-G adapter that doesn't work with WIN98SE. Netgear and D-Link's units do. There isn't any technical reason for this that I can think of, so they must be too lazy to modify one of their drivers? Cisco better get on their case."
1,Horrible connection stability,"This is a simple adapter, most of the time it works as it should and gets the job done, but when you try to download something big like a 1GB file or load a web page with a LOT of images it will disconnect you from the Internet without a warning and you will not be able to reconnect unless you physically unplug the adapter and let it reconnect by itself, and this is a pain."
3,Concur with below reviewer,"I've set up a linksys network with a wrt54g router and initially two wusb54g clients. Transfer rates between the two clients hovered around 9-10Mbs. I took the two USB adapters back and traded them for the PCI adapters and that change alone boosted my transfer rate to around 30-35Mbs (still not the advertised rate... but hey, when do we ever get what was promised?) The USB adapters just don't seem to have the throughput."
2,"Started out great, but became unpredictable...","I set up this wireless adapter to connect with my fiance's Microsoft 802.11g wireless router (about 6 feet away from my computer) and at first, it was a great connection, never had any problems. But lately, it drops the connection, 1-2x per day now even though my fiance's cable internet connection is fine, and I have a lot of trouble getting it to re-connect. My error message says it's connecting to the router but the router is not connecting to the Internet, which totally isn't true. We can't figure out what the problem is - perhaps compatibility issues between Linksys and Microsoft - but I know I have to reboot my computer several times and even re-enter the WEP key since for some reason, the Linksys software doesn't save it automatically. I can't figure out how the connection can drop so often when we're literally only about 5-6 feet from one another in the same room. Basically, I'm searching for another adapter at this point."
5,Perect!! Suggest for All VISTA Users,"This is Perfect! When i had an Professional install me a Wireless Adapter and an Router, he came and You know? he gave me one of these, Not made for Vista, i wouldn't be able to restart or reboot. But this is perfect, its better than the one the professional gave me! Like i get ALL 5 Bars instead of the 4 i use to get. and this is Perfect i'm able to shut down and reboot. Just Remember, Its Perfect. xD Perfect Plug N And Play!"
2,not compatible with netstumbler any more,"Note: ignore this review if you just want to use it to 'connect' to wi-fi networks. Stumblers/war-drivers encouraged to read on.we got this card since it was listed in www.stumbler.net/compat/ list of compatible devices. Turns out they have changed the chipset in version 4, and it is no more a good choice if you expect beyond simply connecting to wireless networks."
1,DOSEN'T SEEM TO WORK,HAVE A LINKSYS ROUTER BUT CAN'T SEEM TO GET THIS ADAPTER TO CONNECT TO THE ROTOR. DOWNLOADED DRIVER FROM LINKSYS BUT STILL CAN'T CONNECT.
1,Didn't work properly. Had to return to Linksys.,"Not much to say. It didn't work. The inclusion of a one sheet piece of paper in the box instructing me NOT to use the install disk if I had Windows Vista (and i do) was a clue of things to come. I was instructed to go to the Linksys website to download the correct driver which proved utterly confusing so I wound up doing a live chat session with a 3rd world cust service rep with broken English. Finally got the correct driver installed. The device worked ... for about 15 minutes then would ""freeze"" on me. It recognized my wireless network but wouldn't connect me to the internet. This went on for several days ... a cycle of install, freeze up, uninstall, and reinstall .... would work for 15 minutres or so then die. Finally returned it to Linksys. They sent a replacement which thus far (knock on wood) seems to be working. (At least after a week it still works.)"
1,Causes Registry Errors,I reinstalled this device manually about 6 times before I finally discovered that it had a registry error. Had to dive through hundreds and hundreds of registry listings and delete the listing for it. Major pain.On [...] I found 3 or 4 other folks out there had this same problem with 32 bit Vista. Not just me.
1,"Linux users beware, probably Mac users too.","I originally had the WUSB54Gv4 Linksys adapter on an XP desktop, which worked okay. Though there was a wall in the way, I wasn't very impressed that it only got a 30% signal from a router 8-9ft away. Then I got sick of windows and installed Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron. It took me two weeks to get this thing working, and then when I almost had the driver installed, the computer crashed. Never had any problems with Ubuntu on my laptop, but this was a headache. You can probably find a better product for the same price, just keep looking.Footnote: While trying to find drivers, I stumbled into several other owners with similar problems, and one posted a letter from Linksys in response to an inquiry about Linux support, and Linksys replied that this product was intended for Windows, no Linux or Mac."
1,campatable with windows vista,I have a new computer with windows vista when i pluged the linkyes wireless adapter into the computer it cant detect what it is i down loaded the cd it came with and when its done down loading it wont open to set it up so im guessing it just wont work with windows vista im so frustrated i hate to have order another one or somthing differant ugh!
1,I was trying this product for years. Always the same trouble.,"I was buying this product for some of my clients for many years.I also had one for my wife, and it was nothing but frustration.Even if you get a strong signal, it will drop, or it will become weak from time to time. Completely unreliable.Then, most of these units after a while stop working, become corrupted and unusable.I highly recommend PCI cards. Avoid wireless USB adapters like a plague.k"
3,Incomplete,This product took some time to install. The CD would not initially work on Windows Porfessional without changing the properties. Loading the drivers was another challenge; they would not load from the CD. I had to copy them from the Linksys website. The product works well now and the price was excellent.
4,Linksys Wireless USB Adapter,"The Linksys Wireless-G 2.4GHz USB Network adapter is a great product. Installation was a breeze. You install the software then plug the USB adapter into any free usb slot. The computer immediately recognizes the hardware, and searches for a wireless signal. Once a wireless signal is acquired, and you're allowed access, you're online. Works great with a pc, or a notebook."
1,Boring movie about terrible peole,The movie is extremely slow and boring and features the misadventures of a stupid guy and an insane sociopath girl. There is nothing redeeming about this movie.
4,good movie,"Did not know what to expect but it was good. I pretty much figured the end to be what I thought but otherwise, it was pleasant. The young lady in the film was hilarious. I think we all have this person in us or know this person personally and emotionally. different type of movie that was really good. Thanks for the option and for some this is a will be a delight."
1,This did not work with my DELL 1600SC,"The bios of my DELL 1600SC does not recognize this card. Here are the details:1] I plugged the card into ANY PCI-X or PCI slot (I tried them all) The BIOS and windows does not recognize the card.2] Start windows, then hot plug the card (not safe to do) into any slot. No luck here either.3] Start computer, enter bios (with or without card in slot) Bios shows slot empty. Then remove and reattach the card while in bios setup (not safe to do) Now bios shows the card as present. Exit BIOS, windows recognizes the devices and it works with my eSATA HDD. Upon reboot, windows can no longer see the card.Looks like a BIOS problem, either with the mobo or PCI card, I don't know"
3,Very disappointed!,"They don't include a cable, I had wait for 3 more weeks and expense unecesary money to work with this eSata card. It works very good but they must bring at least one cable!"
4,perhaps a slightly above average RPG,"Game seemed a bit rushed in development and it shows, however it made a bit more interesting story I thought more twists and made it about the same as the first. Once again strangely a good game but a bit worse than the original."
2,Not a very good game.,"I'll tell you one thing, it's no Final Fantasy. When I first bought this game I didn't have but a few games and I wanted a good RPG for my Dreamcast. It was mediocre at first, but the more I played it the more boring it got. The story line is very [bad] and it seems like all you do is go in and out of huge frustrating dungeons which isn't as fun as they make it seem in the description anyway. This game seems like there wasn't ery much effort put into making it, you do the same thing over and over again, it's not a very good game, I gave it two stars just because I generally like role playing games."
4,New and Improved,"This will be a great game when it is released. It has the exact same battle system as the first game, new attack animations, and *gasp* an actual storyline. It seems that Mag, Linear, and the rest of the cast is back from the first game. The story for this game is that a new guy named Yurka has come to town and starts a feud with Mag. Linear likes this new guy and Mag thinks he is trying to destroy them. This game will have all the random dungeon crawling of the first game. There is still only one town, although it is bigger then the first town. Still it is the best RPG yet for the Dreamcast and will most likely stay that way until Eternal Arcadia comes out. Although Silver could topple this one."
2,You've heard it before.....,"I'll make this quick....Asteria's ""Slip into Something More Comfortable"" is a nice effort by these NW Indiana guys but the problem is, its nothing that hasnt been done to death a million times already and alot better I may add. If your looking for something thats gonna be groundbreaking, move on.Considering the average age in this band, the musicianship isnt bad. They do however show their age with the easy-cheez filled lyrics. As bad as that description is, the lyrics are worse.Like I've said, their young kids so things could change but as of right now, I advise you to save your money and look in something else."
4,Good deal for the money!,Looking for something simple to do my own pedicure at home. This works easily and it's very compact. Would recommend!
4,Appears like a good product,I purchased this item for my daughter's birthday and it appears to be one of the better shapers. I have had several that were weak and am hopeful this one lives up to the previous reviews. It came quickly and was packaged appropriately.
4,"Compact, powerful and safe","I have found the Personal Manicure and Pedicure Set to work well. It has all the power you might need. But, I think it is substantially overpriced."
4,Good for mens toenails,I got this for my husband who has toenails from H--L. Now he can do his own tonails and I don't get cuts in my sleep. LOL Every man needs one. He has had it almost a year and it's still going strong....
1,mdav,The product is totaly useless. If you apply any pressure at all it stops working. A waste of money.
2,I don't find it useful.,"I wanted this this for the nail buffer, but that generates so much heat on my nail that it is very painful! The other attachments leave a distinct ledge on my nails when they grow out, and weaken the nail. The only good use I have found for this is when I broke a tooth, I used it to file down the sharp edge until I could see a dentist. Of course, this is not its intended use and should not be attempted by anyone ever..."
2,Not worth the money,"If you really want a good manicure/pedicure set, spend more money on a better quality product. This is actually quite flimsy and doesn't really do a very good job. Also I would have appreciated better instructions on how to use the various attachments."
1,DO NOT buy this,"This product is cheaply built. Spend the extra money and get a quality product. It has a flimsy plastic outer shell. The attachments wobble when inserted. I dropped it from less than three (3) feet onto carpet and now the switch will not stay in the ""ON"" position. I would have sent it back but my 30 day trial period expired. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, please.Nail Care Plus Personal Manicure/Pedicure Set"
5,Great product,"With my priority to buy a battery operated Manicure/Pedicure set, this one was a simple choice with the number of good reviews it has got. Though a touch pricey, it sure is a quality product, which I belive will last for a long run.And I wasn't dissappointed post its delivery, I gifted it to my neice and she likes it very much.I'd definitely recommend it."
2,Not what I expected,"I read other reviews before ordering this product, so I was expecting more power and a better result. This is about the same as a 'cheapo' one I got at a local drugstore. I wish I'd plunked down the extra $$ and gotten a 'real' one. Now I have two sets I can't use!"
2,More trouble than it's worth,"I got this to work on toenails that are difficult to cut, but this thing didn't work that much better than normal clippers, and it took forever to do it. Perhaps using it on someone else would work fine, but it's not for me."
4,"Funky, laid back and dope","On MJG's solo album, he comes off like a hard-working normal guy who happens to be a rapper. Most of the songs center on everyday stories and observations. MJG is not really thugged-out, not conscious, but rather occupies a nice middle ground.The production is mostly laid-back and funky, though the title track incoporates some dissonance, creating a more ""dirty"" sound over slap bass.This is a solid and fairly diverse album that would be a nice addition to the collection. Definately a great buy if you can find it for a fair price."
5,THIS IS THE $#!+. . . SO GET IT!,"I THINK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS...EVER! I COULD LISTEN TO THAT SONG TEN MILLION TIMES WITHOUT HATIN' IT. THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD. IF YOU LIKE PIMPIN, OR GANGSTA FUNK, THEN GET THIS. I THINK HE IS LIKE A TOO SHORT FROM THE DIRTY SOUTH. THE ONLY MEDIOCRE SONG ON THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS GOOD DAMN MAN; THE HOOK IS SILLY."
4,Solid Solo Debut,"As One half of some of the south's rap Pioneers, MJG delivers his debut solo before Eightball (surprisingly) and it is a good album. Though I like Eightball a little more, this album is as good as a most of 8's solo one's (better than a few) as well as some of their group albums. It has 13 songs of Mo-Suave funk. The Mo-Suave production team does a good job (as always) on this one as well. It has 1 classic, 6 good songs, 4 that are ok, and 2 that I skip. Guests are few and are on 4 songs (3 of the songs have 8 ball and oddly they aren't nearly the best songs on here). A must have for southern rap fans and fans of the Memphis duo.#1 -8#2 - 8#4 - 7.5#5 - 8 (f/ eightball)#6 - 8.5 (f/ rodney ellis on the hook -- upbeat song)#7 - 9 (good beat)#8 - 7 (f.

1,"Horrible editing, but there isn't much else out there to use ....","Horrible editing that SHOULD embarrass the company. Watch out for the typos and some logic errors, but there isn't much else out there to help you so ... this book is probably your only choice. Don't buy it, just use the copy from your local library or the copy at Barnes & Nobles / Walden's so you don't have to waste your money on it. Good luck."
1,HP Deskjet 820Cxi / Drivers - virtually non-existent for me,"My company had this printer on hand. I needed to install it on a new standalone (no internet) PC. This PC is an integral part of proprietary equipment, so could not be connected to the internet. The HP site states that I can use the driver included with Win 7, but there was no driver with this printer's id. The printer's interface is parallel/centronics. After 3 hours of searching on the internet, my best opportunity was on the HP site and the driver was described by HP as not downloadable - could only be installed to a printer connected via USB (not parallel). I expected to download the driver to a PC on the internet, then write it to a CD. Bottom line for me.... stuck"
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book, I have nearly 20 antique book volumes I was needing to know the value of and I found only 2 of them listed in this book. I feel this purchase was a waste of my money."
4,Very good but not as I expected.,"Although I am a great TA fan, her latest Fade to Red video collection was not as I expected it to be. This is my personal opinion: The videos should have been in chronological order to see and apprecciate her musical evolution and changes. Also, there was no need to use two DVD's, or in the case i would prefer to have 1 DVD with the videos and anothre Bonus Features DVD. And I didn't like the design at all.Despite all this I really enjoy watching her videos once and again, it is a really enjoyable collection. Of course most of her videos are not astonishing but just seeing her is enough.The best: Sleeps with butterflies, 1000 Oceans, Spark and Cornflake Girl (UK vesion)"
1,Incomplete Collection Over Shadows Long Wait For DVD!!!,"Wow, am I so mad at this collection. Where the heck is ""Glory Of The 80s"", and ""Strange Little Girls"", TWO AMAZING VIDEOS. They even could have put ""The Big Picture"" on here. It would have been a treat, and worth spending the money on this.I don't like the way they changed the AUDIO MIXES on these vidoes. Now we'll never get a REAL Tori Amos Video Collection, because it's already been done. What a shame to have such a missing links product on the market for such an amazing and deep goddess like Tori Amos.And why is this collection on Two Discs. For those of you who are unhappy with this release, call Rhino's customer support at 818 - 238 - 6100 , and file a complaint."
3,same bonus features on both discs,"Whats the deal with the repeat of bonus features on each disc. NOt only is that a waste of a good opportunity for us to own new material, but I am pretty sure everyone who has this dvd also has the dvd single for ""A Sorta Fairtale"" with the same footage already!!!!!"
4,Great collection!,"As usual, Tori Amos pulls off a product with stunning visual graphics and packaging. This video collection is great (I've always loved Tori's videos, for the most part they're quite original and intrigueing) My only beef with this collection is that it is not complete, leaving out a couple of songs. Other than that, well worth the money to be able to watch these on DVD (her videos were only available on VHS before this came along) and enjoy the commentary made available as well."
4,Piano Goddess,I have always enjoyed Tori's music.This DVD showed wonderful abstract art in motion.I loved it. I can't wait for more.
3,Needed a little more...,"Since the bonus videos (and making of documentary) were accessible on both discs, it didn't make since not to replace them on one of the discs with Strange Little Girl, Glory of the 80's and Mary (especially since the ""Professional Widow"" remix video was kept on). Obviously, I wasn't expecting The Big Picture (from Y Kant Tori Read) to be on there due to Tori's feelings towards that album, but the others should have been on there. I have the video collection on VHS, and since it still lacks videos (and is thus little more than a repeat, minus a few videos and the commentary), I had to give it only 3 stars."
5,Love it,"Absolutely great video collection, but everything Tori is awesome. If your a Tori fan you should get this to add to your collection of Tori items."
4,Strange,"Is a great DVD video collection, I hear Tori such a long time ago and is a pleasure to see her carreer throght her music video. I'ts a shame that ""Strange Little Girl"" video is not in this DVD."
4,Where is Glory of the 80's?,"Why? That video is so funky, and it's one of my favorite Tori songs. If it included Bliss, a jumbled up edited concert montage, surely it could have included Glory of the 80's. I remember when I was a blossoming Tori-phile, finding those videos somewhere on the net, thinking ""I really hope they re-release her videos"" because I'd never seen Strange Little Girl, 1000 Oceans, and Glory. Come to realize, SLG isn't included either. I feel kinda jipped."
5,the definative work,A must read for all interested those in psychology. This work is the definition of dialectical behaviour therapy. Highly recommended.
4,Too wordy for me,"I found this too wordy for me... I need little fluff.. since I have done a lot of therapies, I don't need to be 'taught' a lot of what is in here...I also don't agree with some of it.. I feel anytime a person can get away from drugs, thats the best choice.... always..I founda book on SOMATIC RESPIRATORY INTEGRATION that I've gotten a lot out of... help with depression, PTSD, Anxiety and Panic disorders... and quit smoking.. have learned how to control and eliminate migraine headaches... and just general better feeling and health... It is normally done in conjunction with some Chiropractic care, and is very enlightening..and empowering,l which I have not found a drug can do....I don't want to just get drugged.... I want a better quality of life.. and an understanding of my emotions so that I can work thru things .... SRI worked the best for me... but....My husband, who also has PTSD....loves this book, and is reading it and getting a lot from it.... so... it' just depends"
4,very good resource,"i like this work. it provides the reader with practical suggestions and exercises. it covers most of the problems encountered in mood disorders and anxiety. it could go more into interpersonal issues. overall, i believe it is a very good resource and i've been using it as a core reading for a therapy group. at the price, new, i think that it is worth the purchase for the reduction in distress and improved coping skills. i'm surprised by the average rating overall by other raters and find it well worthwhile."
1,"Should be called ""Dialectical Cogntive Therapy""","Seems much more about cognitive therapy than behavioral. I'm familiar with Linehan's model which seems, to me, truer to the behavioral paradigm of holding your thoughts, beliefs, and feelings while acting differently. Linehan puts the dialectic between behaviors and private experience in the Buddhist sense of ""walking with both things together."" The dialectic for Marra is between ""hopelessness and hopefullness,"" ""safety and freedom,"" ""despair and inspiration,"" and ""resignation and initiative"" (to take a few examples from the book). I think this misses the point entirely. Whether you're looking for self-help or materials to assist with your clinical practice, check out some of the materials from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Steven Hayes, Kelly Wilson, Kirk Strosaahl, etc.) or Linehan's workbook for DBT with BPD (you don't need Borderline Personality D/O to benefit from her fabulous work)."
3,Finally DBT skills in self help form,"I would have given the author 4 stars however it is very clear from the beginning of the book that the author has a strong anti-medication basis.However, I am excited to see DBT skills presented in a highly accessible format.Like any self help book some of it works some of it misses. This is seems to be best used as it is written. It is not a book that lends itself to skimming or picking and choosing chapters."
3,"Good sound quality, however cord is too short.","I just got this item today. They are nice little earphones, fit comfortably on my ears, however the only thing so far i don't like about them is that the cord that plugs into the mp3 player is really short!! might have to find an extension for it if they make them."
2,This is not what it appears,This is sold as a DDD recording but some of the recordings are over forty years old and hiss like a snake. This should be categorized under 'Historical Recordings'
3,"Great selection, poor sound quality","Adagios are beautiful and represent the depth of the composer. However, as one reviewer stated before me, the sound quality is poor. Some pieces have to compete with the hiss to be played as they should be at normal volumes. I hope that another label can come out with such a stunning array of adagios but with a much improved sound quality."
4,great music,The recordings are old but for this low price for 2 cd's it's well worth it. Anyway it plays great on my bose system and my bose wave radio. I did not get any hissing.
2,Big whoop!,After doing more research I have found this to have many unsubstantiated claims. Really wish I hadn't wasted the money.
4,Christmas with Agnetha of ABBA,"Let me start by stating that I love, love, love ABBA! That is why when I first saw Agnetha's Christmas CD, ""Nu Tändas Tusen Juleljus,"" available on Amazon; I just had to purchase it. Her vocals on this 1981 recording are exquisite. While the idea of recording a Christmas song with one's child is precious, including them on almost every song is a bit exasperating. The cover of the CD clearly reads, ""Agnetha & Linda,"" so I suppose I shouldn't have expected just Agnetha's vocals. No offense to Little Linda. She has an endearing child's voice. Based on each selection, I gave this CD 3.3 stars but because of Agnetha's lovely voice, I gave it 4 stars. If Agnetha would have performed more solos, this certainly would be a 5 star Christmas CD. If you're an ABBA fan, this is an essential recording!"
2,"If you're looking for an Abba-like Christmas CD, this isn't it","If you like Alvin and the Chipmunks, you'll love this CD. The second track (Swedish version of Jingle Bells) is a keeper, but I the rest of the CD made me want to jump out of my skin. The individual tracks are okay on their own, but taken as a an entire collection, it's lethal."
4,A real story you must read!,"As a child I knew Earl Parker. He was a friend of my fathers. I never knew of his experiences until I read this book. I found out about the everyday heroism that won the war: helping your buddies and maintaining your humanity when in inhuman situations. Earl's stories of surviving capture at the battle of the bulge are told in a matter of fact way that shows you the attitude of this generation. It was their duty to fight and to survive AND to retain their humanity. They risked their lives for their families, friends and freedom and we owe them a debt. This is a simple narrative that inspires me, especially since I knew the man. His strength, his simple leadership and his humility provide an example to us all."
2,Not a good choice of study material,"I bought this guide to study over a two week period before sitting for the test. I spent about 2-3 hours per day 4-5 days of each week taking the practice tests, looking up questions I got wrong and making detailed notes. By the time I was ready to sit for the exam I could ace every practice test in the booklet. Imagine my surprise when I sat for the test and felt completely unprepared. I managed to pass, but honestly, I don't think this book gave me any kind of advantage, I just got lucky in that several of the questions on the exam were common knowlege or common sense. I would NOT reccomend this item for the Human/Cultural Geography DSST. The questions in the book are not even remotely representative of the exam questions. I would strongly recommend picking up an inexpensive used textbook and studying chapter summaries instead. It would probably give you better odds of passing. Basically, your $25 could be better spent elsewhere."
2,Human Cultural Geography,"I did not find this book particularly helpful in preparing for the Human Cultural Geography Dantes test. Most of the questions in the book are not on the test. The answers are not explained and the pages are not numbered, which made researching and referencing challenging."
3,Get the AP Geography Book,I don't know about this book but I do know the AP Human Geography book would help. I just took the test and didn't really study at all. I passed barely. A lot of it is common knowledge. I got the AP Human Geography book and if I would have had time to study it the test would've been a lot easier.
4,Good stuff...sorry it's not more widely available (minor spoilers),"I saw this on British television a few months ago. I was sitting in front of the screen, expecting to change channels in a few minutes...but the film gripped me. That black and white start which changes into colour, it's brilliant direction. The basic premise---dying man has to find out who killed him---is unique, depressing and yet gripping. I daresay most of us are hoping he'll find a cure for the poison. The bodycount in the film is high, and many of the deaths turn out to be unconnected to the poisoning. I am not going to give the ending away, only to say that it's a good film for all writers or wannabe writers..."
4,"Much, much better than the program's reference manual.","Whatever you plan to use DesignCAD for this out of print book is just what the people at Viagrafix should have included with their program. The program' reference manual is so bare bones that I found myself almost defeated in spite of the ""on line support"" the company brags about. This book explains parameters, layouts, techniques and much more that shows the total potential using this program. Inside DesignCAD is written just like a college text book. If you are serious about CAD this is a serious book. Now it is outdated by new programs. Hopefully the author will consider a new book. If you are using Viagrafix's new DesignCAD Pro 2000 this outdated book still offers good information that is totally lacking in the program's manual."
4,J's Diamonback,"I recently moved to AZ and my 4 1/2-year-old grandson has been hoping for a picture of his grandmother with a rattlesnake--my mistake, not his. I joked that I would send him a picture. He took it seriously. Each time we talked on the phone, he would ask if I saw a rattlesnake and I was thankful I had not seen any snakes. I sent him the toy rattlesnake and he was happy to receive it. I think it was both exciting and a little bit scary.Thanks for the help."
1,Not exactly perfect,"Incredible! Outrageous! Unbelievable! It boggles my mind to know that a kind, wonderful person like Michael Peterson can so easily be railroaded into prison. The only ""true crime"" in this book is an innocent man being punished for a murder that never happened. I find it interesting that the only people Ms. Jones interviewed for her book were people who didn't really know Mr. Peterson well or who had much to gain from his conviction. Truly one-sided yellow journalism at its best."
4,Very interesting,"I have very little patience when it comes to reading. I give a book about 10 pages before I decide if I will continue to read it or not. I was hooked from page one. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found it very interesting and easy to read. I have a very short attention span when it comes to reading and I found this book to be quite engaging."
1,don't bother,"I would expect more from such a well-read/known author. This book is cursory and superficial at best and offered little more than was broadcast on CourtTV. I kept hoping for more, but apparently as an accomplished writer she wasn't contracted to produce anything greater than a play by play of the courtroom highlights. VERY disappointing!!"
2,Not the best book on this murder,"There is a much better book concerning this murder ( and the first murder ) committed by Michael Peterson. It is ""Written in Blood"" by Diane Fanning, and it is by far the superior book. Much less confusing, much less meandering, Fanning's book manages to span the time frame between two similar crimes of women associated with Peterson.Much more horrifying is the fact that the children of his first victim in Germany became his wards, and remained in his custody, loving him, the murderer of their mother.I suggest that anyone confused or put off by this author's style pick up a copy of ""Written in Blood."" Everything is more cohesive and the spine prickles much more pronounced.There will be no doubt in your mind that Peterson committed both murders. Evidently the courts agree with Diane Fanning, too, as Michael Peterson's final appeal against his life sentence was denied in 2007."
3,Fairly interesting,"I would like to say that this is my first time reading a book by this author. I have to agree with another reader who stated that Jones' writing was amateurish. In fact at times I believe that she was adding a great deal of filler, as she could not possibly know everything that was going through the minds of those who were at the heart of the story. Now, having said that, I would like to add that I don't think this site is appropriate for a discussion of whether or not Peterson is innocent. At any rate, I would only recommend that someone buy this at a discount price or check it out of the library. I am generally not a fan of people who try to capitalize off tragedies and after reading this I stand by that even more firmly. The book was interesting, but don't expect to find a classic. You won't."
1,Was not what I expected,i wanted to read more of a novel. i fond it to be too much of just to be a long read on the city of Atlantic City. I did not finish it and don't plan to. Sorry just not my kind of read.
3,Boardwalk Empire,Great book. Visualized many historic times in AC. The ending was a little quirky. With the authurs own ideas of how AC should proceed for the good of the community.
4,Book Review,This book was a good historical read. It was shipped to me in a timely manner and in the specified condition.
2,Not at all what you'd expect,"I didn't watch the TV show, but read this book based on reviews and its potential.It's readable enough but is a dry, historical, descriptive account.I'd have given it 3.5 stars, but it is way over-rated by some."
2,Atlantic City,"Having been born in Atlantic City and having a family living there for most of the 40s thru the 60s, I looked forward to reading this book. It was interesting to learn how the city was founded and the reasons for its founding. However I didn't recognize one name that was mentioned. I was expecting to see at least my grandfather named there. However, everything was about the Republican control of the city and its corruption. Yet not one word was mentioned about Lenora Slaughter who hosted the Miss America pageant and was a friend of my mother. The hurricane of 1938 was equal to Hurricane Sandy and was as destructive. Hardly a word. We read about racketeers and corrupt politicians. Yet we don't read very much about the decent citizens who worked hard to make a living. The book was made to watch the the TV movie and buy DVD disks. I was disappointed."
3,Not what I expected,"This book is very informative and incredibly dull. I've not seen the television version but, from the promos and recommendations from friends, it appears to be attention-holding. The book is more of a very dry history; informative but a bit of a slog to get through."
3,Boardwalk drags,"I will probably finish Boardwalk, but have put it aside for a while. It seems to bog down in detail. The book started off with a ""bang"" and I thought,""Hmmm, this will be very good!"". I enjoyed the ""founding"" of Atlantic City, but the story seems to drag on and on without getting to the ""meat"" of the story."
3,BOARDWALK EMPIRE - THE BOOK,"THE BEGINNING WAS VERY INTERESTING, BUT FOUND AS I READ FURTHER IT WAS RATHER DRY. THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE OF THE BOOK A LITTLE LOW."
3,Started well but ended dull,"The book deals with the history of Atlantic City from its beginning as a bug infested barrier island to gambling resort. Pitney's dream of a health spa for the masses turned into an anything goes boardwalk of vice for the blue collar workers of Philadelphia and New Jersey. Louis Kuelnle, Nucky Johnson, and Hap Farley ran the town over 60 years from a beach resort to a depressed slum by the ocean. The early days of Atlantic City were interesting but the later part of the book and Atlantic City's history were depressing. If you are expecting the HBO Series, this book is not going to impress you."
4,Good history,"This was a good history of AC. But I do not believe the author is really from the area. He mentioned a sandwich that the area calls a ""SUB""......but I enjoyed everything until the end where it seemed he was trying to get elected himself."
3,Boardwalk Empire,"I am a die-hard ""Boardwalk Empire""(HBO series)follower and never miss a segment. I just love the dramatization of the 1920's era and that's what drew me to this book. Well, I found out that the HBO series and the book have little in common. If you are a fan of the HBO series and your are truly interested in the entire history of Atlantic City from early colonial times well into the 1980's, then you will love this book. I on the other hand was not interested in the history of Atlantic City and was looking for more information on the era covered by the HBO series.This book just touches on that era and learning all about the previous corrupt officials and later dishonest public servants and gangsters just didn't do it for me. I gave the book three stars because I believe the book was well researched and written, but if it had been titled, ""The History of Atlantic City,"" I could,t have been more disinterested."
3,Not Really for Fans of the Show,"I feel badly giving this book a mediocre review since the author can hardly be blamed for the book not being as good as the tv show it inspires. But I do fear a lot of people will be directed to this book as fans of the tv show and it's simply not for them. There are some small parts of it that relate to the 1920s era but most of it is a relatively dry history of the town. And I'm not really even sure the town is all that interesting. If you're a fan of the history of certain American cities then I guess it fulfills a wish there, but I found the book a bit boring and hard to finish despite not even being that long. Oh well."
2,Do NOT Buy,"Like some of the other critical reviews of this book, I did not like this book. I love historical fiction, but there were too many biased statements to have made this an enjoyable, credible book for me. I agree with one of the reviewers who stated that the entire book leaned toward being propaganda.I also found this book to be repetitious and derogatory toward certain groups of people (ie, successful).It was not worth the $1.99 I paid for it-----get it from your library if you have the urge to read it."
2,barely ok,I put it down in favor of something more exciting. It seems to just be a history book. Maybe I'll try to get a little farther some time later.
4,Give the People What They Want,"The book has some great stories about the colorful group of characters involved with Atlantic City from its inception up to the present.Start with a nice blend of well-connected politicians shaking down businesses, then sprinkle in some organized crime and illegal acts. Add legalized gambling and you get Atlantic City.The part I found the most fascinating was the ward system of politics, how people moved up in the system and how long it actually lasted. I never saw the HBO series modeled after this book, but I doubt if it is as good as the book - entertaining and informative."
5,great,"bought for my husband, he enjoyed this book so much. learned so history of atlantic city and was fasinated by the book"
3,boardwalk empire,"enjoyed reading the beginning of the story.after a while it gets monotonous and very political. i llked the mafia part but not the politics surrounding this story.should have been titled : The politics surrounding the birth, etc...."
4,Great Read,I enjoy reading this on Kindle at my leisureVery interesting to learn about Atlantic City in the early daysI also enjoy the HBO series
3,A History Of Atlantic City,"A historical account of the area. Not entirely what I was expecting. Based on the title, I was expecting more along the line of the TV series. Ok, nothing special."
2,Kind of a disappointment,"I like history, I spent my summers at the Jersey shore growing up. This book seemed like a natural. So, while I believe the subject merited a book of this nature, I really was disappointed by the writing. It felt like the whole story was a rehash of the author's picture of the underground of Atlantic City's dark side. Not that I don't believe it is true, its just that there seemed to be a lack of first hand accounts of events. There weren't many primary sources and accounts of events from first hand participants. I remember a few of the author's landmarks from my yearly visit to the Boardwalk, when I was young. I think the book would have been markedly improved by actual photographs of the real people and places talked about in the story and forget the HBO actors photos; they did nothing to enhance what is basically a history of 20th century Atlantic City. Sadly, I believe this book could have been so much more."
2,Not my cup of tea,I liked the beginning but soon lost interest as it droned on and on. I did not finish the book as it wasn't worth my time.
2,Boring,"This book is an interesting history of Atlantic City, I did not finish this book. Got about half way through and said enough is enough, I cannot speed read fast enough."
2,Easy to put down.,"For one thing the cover is misleading, if you're expecting this to be a book about the Mob in Atlantic City, you're in for disappointment. I stopped reading this book after Chapter 4, I tried skimming through to find any good parts but lost interest. It's very well researched, packed with a solid history, and very well written; it just wasn't what I expected, that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. It was actuallt very boring, it didn't seem like the author put much excitement into his writing. Reads more like a long history report, so if you're into that kind of book you'll enjoy it. If you're like me and like to read a first hand account or read somehting with some more excitement, save your money."
5,Inspiring,Fabulous book written by my former student whom I love and admire. I am still haunted by some of his experiences. What a tribute to resilience.
3,written by a 7th grade student,"""Niel is a boy that lives at an animal shelter. He is an animal lover. He especially likes dogs and he takes care of them. There is a mystery because dogs keep switching kennels and weird things are happening. The dog who was dropped off was a helper dog so he could open doors and stuff like that. I liked the ending."""
4,Leftovers from the Immaculate Collection,"It was stated that since there wasn't enough room for every single Madonna released at the time, The Holiday Collection EP was released and included the ""Holiday"" (full-length album version), ""Who's That Girl"" (album version), ""True Blue"" (album version) and ""Causin' a Commotion"" (Silver Screen Single Mix). I think this EP is a terrific item to add to your Madonna collection."
3,For the fans only,"I'm a huge Madonna fan, and I just had to have this in my collection. It's meant to be the songs that ""didn't fit"" on ""The Immaculate Collection"", though it was only released in the UK."
3,REMIXED AND RE-INCLUDED!,"For Madonna fans who missed some songs from her first greatest hits compilation, this is a rare gem. It included the full version of ""Holiday,"" and album versions of ""True Blue"" and ""Who's That Girl."" These are title tracks from her albums of 1986 and 1987. The bonus here is the single remix version of ""Causing a Commotion"" not available anyhwere. It arguably sounds better than the original single version.Madonna complemented her Immaculate Collection by releasing this compilation.However, she could have included at least two or three more tracks to truly complete her IC and these songs may be ""Keep It Together"" ""Burning Up"" ""Everybody"" or ""Dress You Up/Angel.""Whatever the reason may be, your Madonna collection is not complete without ""The Holiday Collection.""long live the queen!"
2,Didn't read product description thoroughly,I thought this book was a large compilation but it only includes 26 stories. The stories themselves range from okay to poor.
2,Boring,I found most of the stories to be very dull. This is one I regret purchasing! I generally read short stories to find new authors to read - I will not be reading books from most of these!
1,Boring,"I tried to read this book and just couldn't get into any of the stories. Other than one or two, they were all terrible. Go ahead and skip this book. It's not worth the read. The person who put the stories together tries too hard on all his introductions and fails to motivate me to care about the submitters work."
2,Interesting but not scary,"I was hoping the horror stories would be scary, but can't say that any of them were. The suspense stories, in my opinion, were better reading than the horror stories."
1,Dumb,"I love horror and mystery so I thought this would be right up my ally for quick reads in between longer books, but the stories are just dumb!"
3,"Typical Horror Stories-some great, some not so great","I love short stories of any kind. Horror is a favorite. This book had some great moments, but like all anthologies, there are a few stories that a below par. Over all, it is a good book and was worth the purchase. Entertaining."
3,"Just okay stories, with 3 good ones....","This compilation as a whole, I'm sorry to say, was rather weak. There were 3 very good stories out of 29, with the other 26 stories ranging from mediocre to just plain boring. The 3 stand out stories for me were: 'The Road Virus Heads North', by Stephen King, 'Mad Dog Summer', by Joe R. Lansdale, and 'Elsewhere', by William Peter Blatty. I gave these stories a star each for being GREAT STORIES!-- totaling a 3 star rating."
1,999,Can't get past the first story. Boring!! So far this is not worth reading. Can't get past first story because it's slow.
3,Lacking,"Gave it three stars for the few good stories it contained, but for the most part they were pretty boring. Not much horror or suspense in many of them, at least not to me....and what is with all the typos?"
3,"As expected,",As with any collection some you you like some you don't. A lot of reading for the money. Worth it!
5,WOW!,Lots of really well written stories. I was amazed that I loved every single story in this collection. Great writers and great writing. @ thumbs up!
3,Very good,I gave this book the review I did only because there were so many typographical errors. This book could have been edited better then it was having so many well known authors who contributes their stories.
4,Nice mix,"Good mix of authors and styles. Well worth the price paid. Great addition to your Kindle. Where else will you get Stephen King, Neil Gaiman and William Peter Blatty"
4,Campfire Perfect,"This is a great read for ""short"" stories. Some not so short but, I enjoyed the variety and diverse collection of authors. This book gives you a taste of authors you know and some you should get to know. You will find stories that once read, you could turn into a story for the campfire or intimate gatherings with friends. I loved it."
4,good and bad,"some good some not so good,held my interest too many stories that I feel were just used for filler and"
2,Not what it was hyped up to be.,Didn't care for this book. The stories were just not complete. I feel like I read a book of cliff notes. Just my opinion.
2,Wasn't what I wanted/expected,"These are some interesting short stories, but many of them lack a horror/suspense element, instead substituting heavy character development for plot. If you're into that, you'll enjoy this."
2,Stories were horror - ible,"I bought this because of two of the authors who wrote stories in it, namely Stephen King and F. Paul Wilson. I enjoyed those two stories very much. I tried reading three or four of the other stories in the book, and hated all of those that I read. I can't really speak for the whole book, because I gave up after a few stories, but what I read (other than the King and Wilson) I found to be boring and confusing. I got the impression that the authors were trying really hard to be different but instead, just came off in the end as being weird, boring, and confusing. At least that's my opinion. I think I only paid 2 or 3 dollars for the book, so at that price, it might be worth trying yourself, maybe you'll like the stories better than I did."
3,Soooo Many Words Misspelled,"While I enjoyed the majority of the books in this collection, I would not consider most of them horror stories. In addition, my reading enjoyment was upset by the numerous misspellings throughout the book. I was obviously scanned and never proof-read. There are literally hundreds of places where the scanned word did not translate correctly; i.e. lips written as hps. Some of them were so bad, I never did figure out the correct word. IMO, there is absolutely no reason for this kind of shoddy non-editing."
4,Some are iffy.,"Most are very readable, but some 'feel' like the author ran out of gas and stopped. Overall, it's very good"
4,Awesome Book,999 had many stories from great writers. I would have given it 5 stars except that when I found it I got it because of Stephen Kings name and it didn't have much from him.
3,Not sure about this...,"I bought this to power the SmartDisk FireLite drive I was using for backup because I had to start connecting the FireLite drive to a USB hub, rather than directly to the PC. Within two weeks, the FireLite drive failed -- permanently -- and I'm not sure whether the drive failed on its own or whether the power supply caused failure. Either way, I'm not about to buy another SmartDisk, so this power adapter is pretty much useless."
2,Adorable book! But....,"I bought this particular book because my daughter loves her other Barbie lift the flap book, and she also loves scratch and sniff books.The book is very cute, but..the things that are supposed to smell don't work!! Maybe two of them in my copy actually have a very faint scent. The rest don't smell at all. Which I find VERY disappointing considering the price of this book! It is a bit on the pricey side..which I wouldn't have minded if it actually worked. Maybe it was just my copy..I don't know, but regardless for me it was a major disappointment!!Even if they did actually smell, not every flap's picture is scented..I think they all should be for more variety.Do yourself a favor, buy one of the other Barbie lift the flap books instead of this one. They are really detailed and well made.I would have given it at least a 4 star rating if the smells worked!"
2,Dries out!,"Although these are in a container, they dried out very easily. I would use a ziplock bag next time for an extra seal."
2,8in1 Perfect Coat Deoderiizing Wipes for Dogs,"I'm not thrilled with this product. I've used other wipes on my dog that made her shine, smell good, and cleaned better then these. I will go back to the previous brand I was using. However this company does have very good puppy wipes and they smelled good. My dog is now 3 1/2yrs old and I thought I would try this brand again but I was dissappointed with the results."
1,"Cool Look, Cheap Knobs","After just 3 months, the toast selection knob stripped off. I contacted the manuf. but they sent the wrong replacemnt part. What good is a toaster if you can't toast?"
2,Brought it back to the store the same day,"Got this home and set it on my countertop. It wasn't level, which immediately meant it had to be returned. Then I turned the timer knob. It is LOUD! It's like an old kitchen timer that clicks the entire time it is running."
2,snooze,This was cheap all around. The dialog was just ridiculous. The acting was like watching a high school play. How does something like this get on film? Definitely don't bother with the HD version because the effects are low def.Wait till this is in the 0.99 $ bin before renting.
1,Rental video,"My exact thought while watching this movie was ""Wow I didn't realize they made movies this bad"" One of the very few movies I turned off part way into the show. A combo of waste of time and money."
1,They should be ashamed,Someone involved in making this movie sdhould have had the good sense to just step back look at what they were doing and put an end to it
1,This is *NOT* Battle: Los Angeles,"I thought I was renting the recent blockbuster of the very similar name. I don't know if the producers intended to dupe people (like those that made Transmorphers, etc,) or what, but this was terribad. Turned it off after 10 minutes.I'd echo what others said, seemed like a very bad low budget tv movie from 1981."
1,Don't waste your time,"I accidentally rented this move from my online video rental service Cinema Now. I thought I was renting Battle: Los Angeles but got this instead.Within just a few minutes it's clear this is an extremely low budget movie. Poor acting, terrible special effects, and several sections of the story and scenes don't make any sense at all.This might be the worst movie I've ever seen. If it's not the worst, it's certainly in the ball park."
2,attack los angeles,"Shades of the 1950s sci fi !! Holly moses it should be back stamped 1963. Only a few exciting sections, actors were pretty good though."
1,Wow. Simply amazing...,"It's amazing that just about anyone can release a movie these days. I mean, wow. I couldn't even get through the first quarter of the movie, and the only reason I got that far was because I was watching it while cooking dinner. Have you ever been embarrassed for someone else? That's the way I felt in this ""movie"" if you want to call it that. This is some of the worst acting I have ever seen, ever. These guys make Bruce Campbell or Keanu Reeves look like Johnny Depp. I really do feel sorry for them though because they are probably down and out actors trying to make it in the film industry and the writer and director just crushed their careers forever."
1,Ripped off,"I was looking for the new movie BATTLE:Los Angeles....But I accidentally rented this absolute piece of crapAttack:Los Angeles!! The special effects gave it away in about the first 2 seconds of this ""movie"""
1,Cheesy,Very low budget and full of logical inconsistencies from the first few minutes of the movie. I was only able to make it through about 20 minutes of the movie before I had to shut it off. Worst movie I have seen in a LONG time.
1,Who could have made this?,"This movie was bad from the start. Special effects were 1980's television level. The plot was stealing from every science fiction movie ever made...and throw in a little Ninja action. I began to look at it as pure comedy, but it quickly got so boring that I turned it off"
1,Sooo bad!,"We usually enjoy some terrible movies because they're fun because of being awful. We made it all the way through this one but it didn't garner any laughs, just a couple groans. Don't bother with it unless you like watching Nia Peebles in a skin-tight outfit, swinging a sword."
1,Why can't I rate this a Zero Stars?,"Netflix listed the name as Battle of Los Angeles. Very similar to another New Movie...Battle: Los Angeles? Can't believe I fell for this. Don't be fooled, it's a complete waste of time no matter the name."
1,"HOME MADE VERSIONOF THE ""BIG SCREEN ONE""","i rented this movie by mistake, thought it was the one showed some months ago on the big screeneventhouhg it has the HD benefits, quality of the efects are like home made"
1,It begs for running commentary on MST3000,"I don't think this kind of awful can be done by accident, and the director should be kicked in the &%$#. My family finally started our own commentary to relieve the boredom, but even that didn't really help. We rented this on OnDemand, a complete waste of $4 and about 45 minutes of our lives. (We just found something better to watch on TV after that.)"
3,English Lit,"I had to read this book for a college fiction class. I thought it wouldnt get any worse then this. However to my surprise this book was quite enjoyable in a classical kind of way! My professor said that this is supposed to be one of the first novels ever written and I was surprised that it had all the basics of a great modern read. Love,Sex,and Betrayel.If you have to read this book dont be discourgaged its not all that bad. (smile)"
5,Unjustly underappreciated!,"It seems that the only place to buy In Extremo is on-line, where as CDs by bands like Rammstein are in stock at places like Borders. That's just wrong. These guys are beyond awesome. It's ingenius how they mix their heavy metal with mideval instruments, especially the bagpipes! It may sound bad, but it's not. Verehrt und Angespien is brilliant!! The best song is Spielmannsfluch (Minstrel's Curse). It has such a catchy refrain. Ich Kenne Alles (I Know All) is cool too. A really intresting thing about IE is that Das letzte Einhorn, aka Michael Rhein, sings in all kinds of different languages, not just German. Like Rammstein's Sehnsucht, there is a track on this CD in English, but unlike Till Lindemann, Das letzte Einhorn pulls off english very well. Don't get me wrong, I like Rammstein. It's just that I think In Extremo's so much better. Do yourself a favour and buy this CD!"
4,A good buy,"I was expecting something a little more industrial, while the singing/drumming style for this album is a little closer to punk (and I normally despise punk). The mixture of folk and hard rock is still awesome though. Some of it sounds kinda like a German version of Metallica with some cool folk instruments. If you're a hardcore Rammstein fan, this album may or may not be to your liking; there's really no good comparison. If you want something a little more industrial, try Eisbrecher; otherwise you might just want to check this CD out."
4,Rammstein meets Braveheart,"If your a fan of Braveheart this cd is for you. The blend of bagpipes, harps, heavy guitar and drums works great. A few songs don't cut it for me but on the whole a really good cd."
5,Amazing,This is the CD released by the touring bassist with the Japanese Pop sensation Cornelius. I bought this CD at Cornelius' Washington DC show this year. It is wonderful. it has some soft tracks and some dancy fast tracks too. The bass work on it is phenomenal and I will definitely get his next album.
2,Problem with parralle port,"This not supported all the printers. I have a BJC-5100, and it's not work with EFG120."
1,Doesn't work,"This is a piece of garbage. It stopped reading the harddrive about 14 months into usage. Cisco support is based in India, they bounce you around like a hot potato and then after 1 hour tell you that it is out of warranty. It has turned me off to Cisco and Linksys products completely. I used to be 100% Linksys -- not anymore.BTW, I finally did get some support out of Linksys, but it was not easy and definitely not worth the hassle."
1,"Ordered back in mid April,2000 and still in back order 6/00","I heard the 12-inch before, it's pretty cool. - 3 stars for not shipped in 2 month+. Going to get this CD from CDNow instead."
3,"Not bad, but....","I needed this to insulate around my slider after I installed a doggie door. It did the job required, but the glue did not hold well. I am disappointed. Is it excellent? I don't really know what an excellent weather stripping would be, but I would think that as a self adhesive type, it would stick much better. They all seem pretty much the same to me. But, if it had held better, I may have given it more stars."
5,""" Best Opera Ever Written in Hollywood""","What great fun this opera is!! I bought the blu-ray blind. My only knowledge of Stravinsky's music is Rite of Spring and Firebird. I did not know he had a ""neoclassical"" period. One can certainly hear the influences of Handel and Mozart throughout the opera. The guy who sings the devil Nick Shadow steals the show.......he has some high notes for a bass, and he pulls it off nicely. Half way through the opera I was thinking this music is sorta like Sweeney Todd...............there is a high class Broadway sound to this piece..........think Sondheim and Bernstein.....................superb entertainment....highly recommended.On a side note......if your blu-ray player and TV are not perfectly calibrated, you will find out quickly.... checks and lines everywhere..................this is an uber test pattern."
4,Poet as Statesman,"For anyone wanting to know the thinking behind one of the greatest poets of the english language, this book is a must read. Percy Shelley was one of those who saw art and culture as the most powerful of revolutionary weapons against injustice, and for the betterment of mankind. A Defence of Poetry ranks as a crucial piece in the history of human thought."
1,"""Afrocentric Propaganda""","This very brief (22 minutes) video asserts that ancient Egyptian civilization was a product of black Africa; that the classical civilization of Greece, from which European civilization originates, was a product of Egypt; and that American civilization is thus ultimately the product of black Africa. This Afrocentrist propaganda may swell the heads of some inner-city high school students, but it is based on the same shoddy ""scholarship"" that underlies such discredited works as Martin Bernal's ""Black Athena,"" nicely refuted by classicist Mary Lekowitz in ""Not Out of Africa."" The black narrator,who expertise is not credited, cites no recognized Egyptological authority for any of the (mis)information which is so hastily presented. The price (...) would be high for any video, but for one as short and as poorly done as this one, it is far from a bargain."
5,Beautiful plush!,"The Cuddlekins 30"" line are extremely beautiful, soft, large, cushy, and just wonderful for any animal lover or stuffed animal lover. I've bought a few for my nieces, nephews, and my own son and can't wait to give them at their birthdays!!"
1,didnt like,"wasnt as soft as i thought it would be, came in a super small bag the size of a basketball so everything was all bent up and ""nails"" where deformed and not well put together...got it as a gift and the person didnt like it so wasnt a great feeling, should have went with the smaller version maybe would have been better. dont recomend"
2,Age Listed On Amazon's Site Doesn't Match Packaging,"I ordered this based on the starting age appropriateness of 18 months that Amazon lists as both the manufacturer's and their recommended age level. The package arrived today, and it clearly states that it is for 3+ year olds. I'd say for this age, it probably is a good investment. But, it certainly is not for a younger age as they tell you on their site. Honestly, I should've known better myself given that it is foam and younger toddlers still put most things in their mouths."
3,Sound Quality not Impressive,Nothing special in terms of audio quality. It is a nice collection of songs if you are a fan of this type if music. I bought it as a gift for my husband because the artist is his aunt. I thought he might want to pass it on to later generations. I also bought the kindle edition of Kaye's book. It is quite funny.
5,Excellent TV I love it,"THis TV is really really nice, the picture is great and the quality is excellent,there are many features on it and they all work so well. the picture, is great, I can't get over the quality (as it should be) the 780psi? whatever the resolution should be -- the 780 is up there and it really is a great picture. I love the fact that you can input so many devices on it, there is about 25 holes for many differenct devices to plug into tv.AS you can see I am NOT A TECHie hahaha, but I do know a great picture when i See it. wI plugged it in and it was all set. and i did a auto installation and it works great!! I did absolutley nothing to get it going the tv did all the work.This is a good deal!!!"
5,"Wow, what a nice TV for my Florida room.","I bought this TV to demonstrate Karaokes that I have from the Philippines. I did not intend to use it for watching TV alone. But when I first turned it on, setup was automatic, and the quality of the picture was beyond reproach. Now I use it exclusively for watching TV over a much larger TV in an air-conditioned room. That is how truly good this TV is. At one time, I thought Magnavox TVs were of poor quality, but so far this TV is just as good as a Panasonic or Sony.The quality of the sound could be improved, but I am running the sound through wireless earphones and/or a stereo shelf system which I also bought from Amazon.com. I will review the shelf system and wireless earphones in another post.Overall, I could not be more happy with this TV or with Amazon on this particular purchase."
5,This blanket...,"Is extremely soft and warm. The colors are nice, the blue is very deep and the red is beautiful. It's warm and cozy."
2,Al Jolson - 22 Greatest Hits,"You'll like this albumn if you are looking for the odd ""B"",""C"" or ""D"" cut of these ""greatest hits"". However, if you're looking for a CD with those super ""A"" cuts that Al was famous for, you won't find them here."
3,The greatness of Jolson,"Jolson not only had a richness in his voice, an incredible timbre that makes every note feel alive- he had such great hope and feeling, such spirit that moved the listener along with him. Whether it was the 'Red Red Robin' bob-bob-bobbing or the 'Swanee' which he sang how I love you to , Jolson was moving , moving as in too 'California here I come.' And when he wanted to sing sentimental like 'Mammy' or as in 'April Showers' or 'Sonny Boy'he sang with a love that can break the heart.The first great superstar of American song, and one of the greatest still."
1,"Not worth the money, even though it's cheap.","You definitely get what you pay for. I was hoping to get lucky with this product, but it quit working after a week. Don't waste your money!!!! Spend the extra $10-$20 and get a real mouse."
3,Average summary on Type II diabetes,"This book offers an average summary on Type II diabetes. I read it in one sitting and immediately passed it along to someone else. It is not a book that I felt that I ever would need to refer to again, but I didn't feel like it was inaccurate, incomplete or misleading either."
1,How about something written in this decade,"I had intended to purchase book, until I read a couple of pages in the preview. The author states on page 1 and continues on page 2, ""predict by the the year 2000 etc,etc."" That was 10 years ago. I want something more current for my money."
2,"Doyle, come back to bluegrass!","This CD starts out great, but quickly degenerates into more traditional southern gospel quartet music than bluegrass. If that's what you like, you'll like this album, but if you're more into Doyle Lawson's earlier sound, you'll cringe at the syrupy use of pedal steel and rinky-tink gospel piano. Even the vocal blend goes astray at times. If you like Lawson's earlier albums, listen to the samples before you spring for this one. I love many kinds of acoustic music, from traditional to modern, but have never acquired a taste for this kind of gospel. As an old Quicksilver fan, I find this CD a disappointment. Variety is fine, but this CD is schizophrenic in its clashing styles."
4,Working under Linux,"It works well under Windows XP (running inside VM), and Linux (using sane, the buttons is not functioning)"
3,Scanner review,The product performs like it's supposed to I think. I wanted one that scanned into a Word document which this does not. Only into Notebook so it loses the format of the document. Not what I expected.
2,Not worth the price,"It's good in concept, but not in practice. The software does not work well with Windows XP. The installation instructions for the software do not work (i.e., there is no D:\install.exe) Although it's USB, it's not plug and play. You have to manually install several different applications to get it to work. The instructions are a poor translation from a language other than english. The software, once you are able to get it to work, is not user friendly.The first scanner I got did not work properly - it left a white line through everything I tried to scan. The second one works now after fiddling around with the installation for several hours. But it appears that it will only work with the software that comes with it. There are no instructions for the use of that software. There are better portable scanners out there. There has to be."
4,Brazilian Guitar,"I had my doubts about this recording because it seemed like someone made up a name based on 2 giants of Brazilian music: Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfa. Whoever the acoustic guitarist really is the playing is beautiful and lyrical and lovely all the way through. I do wish the pianist, maybe a synthesizer?, but if a musician, would have been allowed to stretch out and really get down to business. If you love acoustic Latin guitar you will be happily transported to Brazil!"
3,Raul Jose's Review,"This CD is attractive for the song content and the interesting name of the performer. The guitar playing is fairly good, reflecting both jazz and latin influences. However, it lacks the Brazilian ""punch"" which I look for in a ""knockout""."
1,POOR PRODUCT,This brush only lasted through maybe 4 uses. The sponge began tearing off its base immediately through normal use. I would recommend a brush with soft bristles. The handle length is the only redeeming quality.
5,"Great read then, great read now!","Like their mother(s) and grandmother before them, my ""grand girls"" love these books. I am lucky to have most of the original series, but they are fragile. It's wonderful they can enjoy Nancy Drew with the new copies."
1,"You want the original release, not this one!","They originally released this on plastiqmusic in 2001 and it was beautiful. The cover is a photo of some place in the mountains in perhaps a station for the gondola, you're in the perspective of the controller booth.Why is this version better? It was the original and intended version. Due to some dispute with the label and them blowing up big on the scene, they moved to Head records and for legal reasons couldn't rerelease the original version so they overlayed some terrible guitar work over it. Most of the time it doesn't even go with the music.If you can find the original release, which does seem hard, it will be worth it!"
3,Fine for another use then my needs,It is a nice product. Flexible. Thin shape lets it flex for great fit.Nice tape included with this product.
5,This Book Spoke To Me Like No Other Ever Has...,"Simply put, this book is a wise selection for intuitive people and/or people who value integrity.People who would like to improve their intuition and/or improve their integrity will prosper as well.Personally, I feel as if I have been reborn mentally and intuitively into a more conscious and balanced human being. This book was also easy, fun and very exciting to read!I really appreciate and highly recommend this book. While and after reading this book, I believe you will gain an abundance of wisdom and insight into almost everything life encompasses.A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)"
3,Too Convenient,"I liked this book when I was younger, but in rereading it at age 43, I find it hard to trust. Shakti is certainly a humble author who is still searching (rather than resting on her past ""discoveries""), but some of her ideas seem to be nothing more than convenient personal inventions. For example, she suggests that anyone we are in conflict with is simply a manifestation of an internal conflict that we have externalized in order to resolve. I find this theory offensive in its tidy resolution of the question of suffering. Would she really tell rape victims or abused children that they had manifested their perpetrators to resolve an inner conflict?I gave her 3 rather than 2 stars due to her deference to 12-step programs."
5,Stepping out of the dark cna be scary!,"And this book gives you the courage to do so! If you are honestly ready to transform your thinking, this book will do it.You will find courage you didn't know you had!Susan BockConsultant and Coach for Business Women[...]"
1,Spiritual Junk Food,"I have to agree with Yikes that this book isn't a good source of spiritual information. What you get is a lot of circular thinking, a mismash of new agey, ""You create your own reality"", fluff that is a sad copy of that spirituality should be. According to Shakti, the reason some folks don't have enough money is either because they are used to being poor or have a creative block somewhere in their lives that needs uncovering. Want more money? Just increase your budget and it will find you. Anyone who doesn't think it is a good idea to use your rent money to buy that parrot will be dissappointed with this book.Want to learn real spiritual principles? Study the book ""Lesson's in Truth"" by Cady and attend good Unity churches (watch out half are too new age-y). Want to understand the mind and learn about illusions? Read a book on cognitive behavioural therapy psychology, I recommend ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns."
5,Living in the Light,"All I can say is...Damn...I met an old college buddy in New York City after 15 years. He told me about a freind of mine who has the power and needs help transforming it. I came back...she knew who I met and for what reasons. If you asked me 24 hours before ""Do you believe in the other world?"", I would have said no. Now after our conversations and reading this book you might say the light has gone on...Thanks for having it available!"
3,This is definitely not Kansas,"Not unless you are thinking In Cold Blood on some kind of drugs. I would have given this book a better rating but all the spiritual stuff left me cold. I'm not into that kind of thing. Otherwise this is a hard, freaky trip. Some of the scenes were like nothing I ever came across before. I wouldn't want to run into the guy who wrote this in a dark alley. I got scared several times while I was reading this book. The last time that happened was when I read The Shining. The spiritual stuff was confusing except when it involved the villan Billy Joe. This is one of the most twisted characters I've come across. There's a teenage girl in this book that is sure to be the cause of a few errections. I don't know. I can't describe it very well. It's different, It's way, way different. I'm going to have to read it again though. It's pretty dense in places. other times it's like being in a fast car on bad drugs while the devil is driving."
1,HA! I see ol' Les himself is pee-oed and is rating the book positively himself...,"How very transparent of you, LES. Please also note that all the positive reviews only review ONE BOOK -- this one. It's Les himself rating his book ""five stars."" ROFLMAO!! Nice contrived monikers, too, Les. ""Sarah Dippity""? HA! I read your book. Or should I say, I migrained through it. It was extremely poorly written. ""Les"" drugs, more college writing courses are in order for you. Poor, pitiful Les. Same old insecurity, I see.In this case, it's highly warranted. This has got to be one of the most derivative, tripped-out-for-the-sake-of-being-tripped-out ""books"" I've ever halfway read. It's not scary, it's not insightful, it's simply mush. I would not spend $2.50 on it in the mustiest shelf of the crappiest used bookstore. It's just that bad."
1,Horrendously written piece of s****,"Where to start? I really can't, because I'll just blather on and on about how bad this ""novel"" is, and then I'd be guilty of what the so-called author does -- drone on incessantly about nothing. Suffice to save I've never read this much crap from an obviously untalented ""writer,"" if you can call the ""author"" a writer. Save your money and your irritation and pass this piece of garbage up."
1,Really Poorly Written.,"Les Visible (yes, that's him directly below me reviewing his own product ROFLMAO) is touting this crap as a ""thriller""? Sorry, Les. It's about as thrilling as watching cheap acrylic paint dry. This has been done so many times before so much better.Les Visible cannot write, period. He can't sing or compose music, either. Save your money. Invest in a newer copy of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and pay homage to a REAL writer."
1,DIdn't Scare Me At All,I found this book trite and obvious. I was ultimately very bored and knew what was going to happen to the antagonist from page three on. I would definitely not put it in the genre of all-time great classic horror novels. It was gratuitously gory and violent and didn't have much of a plotline.
3,had do do a little dremel work to make the pieces fit,had do do a little dremel work to make the pieces fit not that big of a deal though. I am happy with my purchase.
5,The BEST mouse PERIOD!,"Bought mine about 6+ years ago w/lifetime warranty. Well, the mouse outlasted CompUSA & their warranty and still works as good as day 1. It LOOKS like it's about 20yrs old with thousands of hours use. Buttons are totally programmable to suit whatever your needs are. I use Win Explorer a lot so I have the regular buttons set normal and the left+ button set to ""Ctrl"" and the right+ button set to ""Shift"" (for cut, copy & pasting, etc.) with the mouse wheel button set to ""Enter"". I usually only have to even touch the keyboard to type alpha-numeric characters. I just recently resurrected a crashed 2nd PC and I just HAVE to get another. Glad they still make it exactly the same. I give it 10 stars!!!"
2,Hard to follow,"Having no prior knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita, this book wasn't all that helpful. There are absolutely no notes in the chapters and this is almost certainly a work that is incomprehensible without some guidance. Also, it's hard for someone with no experience of Indian languages not to get lost and confused among the long names and the book does nothing to remedy this.Overall, it did not provide the understanding of the Bhagavad Gita I hoped."
2,Serviceable but not the best,"This is a merely serviceable version of the Tao Te Ching - not exceptionally accurate, but what's worse is, in this extremely prolific market, it doesn't offer anything other than a bare-bone translation. No commentary, no explanatory notes or introduction. In such a highly competitive field, this is simply not good enough to fork cash out for a purchase."
1,The Wisdom of the Ages,"Everyone knows how great the Tao Te Ching is!But I want to add that this translation by BRIAN BROWNE WALKER goes so far beyond any other that I have read to capture what is, for me, the real essence of the wisdom of Lao Tsu.I heartily recommend this version and over the years I have given many copies to friends, as I will do with this.David Becker"
2,Weak Translation,"Of the approximately one-dozen translations of the Tao Te Ching that I have read, this is my least favorite. The translation sometimes strays into surprisingly shallow waters.Mr Walker, in an apparent attempt to ""modernize"" the Tao Te Ching, has simply diluted its strength.Mr. Walker's pronoun usage further weakens the timelessness of this classic text. The Tao Te Ching, in its original, uses gender neutral language. The best translations retain this neutrality. Mr. Walker, unfortunatley, uses gender specific pronouns -- sometimes masculine and sometime feminine. This ""modernization"" distracts from the power and universality of the Tao Te Ching's ideas.The book is very handsome, though.If you're looking for a modern yet more faithful and powerful translation -- one with depth and bite -- I recommend two: one by Ellen Chen, and one by Derek Lin.Both are excellent, and both include excellent commentary, too."
5,A great translation of the Tao Te Ching,"I really enjoyed this translation of the Tao Te Ching, and recommend it, as well as ""Tao Te Ching: The Definitive Edition"" by Jonathan Star. Well done."
2,Generous at best,"I read with interest the other reviews on this site and, being a huge DT fan, decided to take the plunge. And what a plunge! The music, as in the playing, itself isn't that bad (and comprises both the stars I am prepared to award), but....and this is a double ""but"" underlined and in bold italics.....the singer is just so awful it completely negates any positive experience. Believe me I tried to get through it as most music in this genre takes a while to grow, still after 3or 4 listen I find it just grates.Avoid!"
5,A new era for hard rock / progressive Metal,"What do you get, when you take old Queensryche, a taste of Dream Theater, and a hint of Dokken? You get Vanden Plas, and their newest CD ""Far off grace"" takes you on a musical ride, you wont want to get off. Soaring high melodic vocals, catchy melodies, and bone crunching guitars mixed in with amazing keyboards, has you wondering why bands like this arent more popular. Fans of Dream Theater may want to take note from this band from Germany. Vanden Plas, has been around since the late 80's, and Far off grace, is their 4th CD from this 5 piece band. Highly recommended!"
2,In-between,"Vanden Plas musically rivals Symphony X. The main difference between the two, however, is the singer. Symphony X's Russel Allen enhances the songs. He sings tunefully and doesn't overshadow the true melodic guitar and keyboard lines. In Vanden Plas, though, the vocalist (I don't know his name...) tends to overpower the melody line and isn't that tuneful in doing it. Maybe V.P. needs to borrow Russel Allen :) Then, they would truly be in the same league as Dream Theater and Symphony X."
5,Cuddl Duds Camisole,Cuddl Duds Softech Cotton CamisoleThis camisole is soft and very comfortable. It is long wearing. Good quality for the price.
4,camisole,"When received, one camisole was packaged with an unfinished, wrong size. I returned it and they promptly refunded my postage and sent me the correct size. So I was Satisfied."
5,I love Cuddle Duds,"I wear camisoles all winter up here in Michigan, and the best ones I have ever found are the Cuddle Duds. Soft, just a hint of lace if they happen to peak out a bit, they keep me warm and toasty. The ones I ordered and received so quickly, are exactly the ones I like the best and have not found in stores here. So, thanks for your wonderful service and the great product."
4,camisole,This camisole has been excellent for years. I love the fabric and that the cut is longer and goes below the waist. It seems to be cut thinner around the midriff.
5,Simply the best!,Try these and you'll agree that they are the best tasting wafer cookie out there! Delicate wafers wrapped up in a mouth-watering dark orange chocolate. You won't be able to stop yourself from having another!
5,"Great video and sound, but complicated","Video processing through DG-1000 is better than when I had DVD & DirecTV satellite hooked directly to TV. Just perfect. (see below) Also excellent surround sound for movies and music--very versatile. However the unit is big and runs hot. It's also the most complicated electronic device I have in my home, after my computer. It took a lot of time and patience to set up, and I'm still experimenting with settings after one month. Still, well worth the time. I chose this over the SONY STR-DG910 because of better specs. (my set-up: HDMI from SONY DVPNS75H DVD player; HDMI from DirecTV 1080i TIVO; into SONY Bravia 42-inch LCD 1080p TV. Sound is 5.1 ORB speakers in 10x8 room.)"
4,Pleases my ears,I have just upgraded from a prior sony 7.1 system and I must say this one rocks. The auto sound adjustment seems to provide a better balance than I was able to provide before. The sound of guitars playing at o db is enough to cut your eardrums which is great. The only down side is the number of optical sound inputs and which inputs I had to use for my devices to match their sound outputs.
1,horrible,i recieved the food processor as a wedding gift about a year ago. The average person doesnt use a processor that much! well this one got about 5 uses and stopped working. And it stoped working making a sundried butter. yes folks it couldnt withstand butter!After contacting B&D they refused to do anything...no servicing the product or even a discount on another processor. Basically my only choice was to buy a new one from them! and the best part was they said it would cost $80. Save ur money folks I wouldnt even give it one star. And the customer service was just as bad.
2,black and decker food processor,"Everything has to be lined up just right for the machine to turn on. Its a safety feature. I can't seem to line it up right and get frustrated. My husband doesn't have this problem. It works for him every time. He prides himself in it. I also think its lightweight and plastic. Its quality is average. If I had to purchase a food processor again, I would look for one that was strong and durable and easier to figure out that its assembly is correct before I turn it on."
1,Outset QS70 Square Stainless Steel Grill Wok,very thin and cheap not what I expected at all could not use it not worth the money and time to return it
