3,Compatibility question?,"I bought this for my son to use with a iPod Touch 32Mb 3rd Gen. When we plugged the charged battery into the iTouch, the Touch produced a message stating this device does not support charging the unit. It appeared to run as an external battery for me for about 5 min, but my son said it would shut off shortly after. It still shows full charge, so I don't know if he just missed the message instruction, but it's clear the Touch doesn't think this is compatible with charging. Be cautious. Got ours locally at Fry's, not on sale, for $19.95."
2,"Not as described, returned for refund","I ordered this as a gift for my dad, but my mom and I were incredibly disappointed with the quality of the leather. It was not shiny and smooth as depicted in the stock photo. The leather felt coarse and looked cheap. It was definitely not worth the price paid, so we promptly returned it."
4,Nice table...,This is convenient but a bit unstable... for its size and weight it is a keeper but there are more stable products out there.
5,You'll love it!,"I bought one of these for my husband, who is a bit large. His old cell phone case would pop off his belt pretty frequently. But not this one!! It's got a single HEAVY DUTY belt clip (meaning he hasn't broken or popped it off his belt yet, and he's had it for several months) and an elastic band that slips over the cell phone antenna. It's got a real ""guy"" look to it that he likes, and it comes in black (a serious biker color). It doesn't come off when he's riding his Harley, mixing cement, or fishing. Finally, a secure case. :)"
3,An O.K. movie - A horrible DVD transfer,"The movie itself is decent enough - but the picture quality is awful. It's washed-out & slightly blurry. Looks like something I recorded on VHS tape at slow speed off a local TV station late at night. If you can get past the picture & sound quality, it's not a bad way to waste a rainy day in the recliner."
4,Paxton and Hamill make the movie,"What this film lacks in directing, it makes up for in flying adventure. Bill Paxton, as well as Mark Hamill give this movie class acting. These two take the weak plot and make it a good movie to watch. Tho it is listed as a SciFi movie,I kept loosing that in the flying adventures, and put it more into the ""after the big one"" scenario. All in all I give it 4 stars for the acting, and flying scenes."
4,completely underated sci-fi fantasy,I really can't understand why this movie is so univerally hated by almost everybody - I haven't seen it for a while but I have thoroughly enjoyed it on every viewing - it's slow moving but atmospheric and thoughtful stuff - if you enjoyed the more relaxed aspects of mad max beyond thunderdome then you should like this - at this price you could always tape over it if you hate it that much! buy it!
2,All of the Actors Pictured are in the Movie!,"I guess that reviewer on March 26, 2005 is really not familiar with American and British actors. Bill Paxton, Mark Hamill, F. Murray Abraham and Ben Kingsley are all in the movie and play important parts. Bill Paxton is the main actor but each of the aforementioned actors do appear, if somewhat briefly for some of them. I bought this DVD in 2004 and if nothing else, I enjoyed the scenery in the flying scenes."
2,Future Shlock...,"In the future, Bill Paxton (Near Dark, Aliens, Titanic) will have long, hipster hair, and everyone will fly around in ultra-light airplanes and balloons! Mark Hamill (Star Wars 4, 5, and 6) will be a rogue cop, on a mission to track down and destroy android Bob Peck (Jurassic Park). The earth will be a scorched world, inhabited by small bands of survivors and wind-worshipping cults. The SLIPSTREAM will blow and blow (much like this feature), killing any who dare enter it on foot. This is the general story of SLIPSTREAM, a dull, lifeless tale of post-apocolyptic hijinks. Ben Kingsley and F. Murray Abraham got their paychecks and ran far away from this dog-log! Robbie Coletrane (Hagrid from the Harry Potter series) sits in a hot tub with a plastic lobster and gets shot. Mind-freezingly slow and incoherent, SLIPSTREAM rolls along like the mastodon turd it is, before finally (blessedly) plopping into the tarpit. Beware! May cause flashbacks and / or coma! ..."
1,If you don't value living watch this movie,"Life is short. The two hours spent watching this movie is undoubtedly the worst way to spend precious life hours. If your doctor tells you that you have two hours to live, watch this movie, and it will surely make the two hours seem eternal. Please don't make the same mistake I did. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
1,Terrible,"A movie with no production value, a nonsense script and no effects or storyline. I'm surprised any of the actors in it who have name value are in it. A complete waste of time."
3,NOT ALL THAT BAD,"For what it is, SLIPSTREAM is not all that bad a movie. It's got interesting characters and some good acting, and the storyline is tolerable if you're not looking for depth. Watching it's a good way to pass a rainy weekend afternoon.To clarify, in regards to Savanthar's completely inaccurate review:Mark Hamill plays the lawman bad guy with the blond hair and beard. Ben Kingsley is the leader of the settlement who gets trapped under the big stone wheel. Bill Paxton is the long-haired hero who streals ""Byron"" away from Mark Hamill at the beginning of the film. And F. Murray Abraham is the mustached leader of the underground museum group whom Mark Hamill clocks in the head with his gun.Enjoy."
3,This flick deserves another look...,"Stay calm. Just because Mark Hamill is in this movie, doesn't mean it automatically rises to the calibre of a trilogy of movies he once starred in - but SLIPSTREAM does deserve a viewing. Hamill breaks from his typecast hero role to successfully play a baddie. But the better reason to watch this flick is to see an amazing performance by the late Bob Peck. His controlled acting and professionalism carry the film. Also look for short, albeit good performances by Robbie Coltrane, Kitty Aldridge and Ben Kingsley. Unfortunately, the hero of the story is a bungling idiot (played by Bill Paxton) whose character may dissuade some viewers from giving this flick a better grade. In a fantasy/action genre that is so often characterized by common themes, surroundings, and plotlines, SLIPSTREAM is a welcome change."
3,Not great,"I took a course with this book as the compulsory text. This book has all the the basic information, but has many mistakes that caused me to mistrust information that I could not corroborate from other sources. The book is badly lacking in illustrations, and the ones displayed are not always clear and / or consistent with the topics discussed."
2,hmm...,"I was very excited about this album. I have read a lot of reviews and was pretty sure that this was something that I would enjoy. This assumption was correct to a point, but also very wrong. There are a few compositions on this album that are worth while, and then there are some who make me feel like I have trancended into an soundtrack for an 80's movie.The instrumentals themselves are not anything wonderful either. Very simple and seem to lack any true human emotion. The use of electronics is a little too much for me, I would prefer using acutal instruments... but perhaps that is just my taste.I would recommend this to someone who has a taste for 80's style electronics or someone who is simply willing to take a chance. Like I stated earlier, a few of the songs on this album are very decent, while others fail to provide anything but slow moving monotanous noise.If you do not own any rachels albums, I highly suggest you purchase any one of those before taking a chance on this."
3,Nauseating!,Book was good. But I am so sick of hearing about these two. I don't know how Diana's mother could stand watching her daughter be used and abused by these two. I wish to God someone would have stepped in and stopped Diana from marrying him. Note that he had absolutely no other prospects for marriage at the time. All his girlfriends ran for their lives. The whole story is stomach turning!
4,Good value/misleading picture,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002LUAN4/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis product was very good quality, new and had all of the official brand name and NFL license tags on it. It fit well and is easy to put on and take off of my child. My only disappointment was that the piture showed it as a regular style jersey when I fact it is a BUTTON BOTTOM ONSIE. Not a big deal but I bought it because I wanted a real looking jersey for my son. All in all, however, the quality of this product was very good and it was a good value."
5,Awesome TV!,"Had since Christmas. No problems and fantastic picture. Upconvert DVD player looks great on the screen as well. SD pictures pretty good for an HDTV, but the best part about this TV is the qam tuner. Wow! I have analog cable and this tv picked up 16 hd stations! Great TV."
4,"GOOD BUY!!, BUT.....","Purchased TV about 6 weeks ago. Not easy to navigate for setup, but after spending considerable time figuring this out, it worked out well. Called tech support on two occasions and I had to deal with people that you could only understand about every fourth word. Somehow with the language barrier I got most of what I was after. Manual was also difficult to understand. The TV has an excellent picture, good sound. Overall a good buy."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I read multiple reviews of this LCD TV and was surpised to hook it up to an HD cable box and be dissappointed with the picture. It is just not as good as a plasma display. I had a Samsung plasma TV hooked up immediately prior to having this TV and ended up giving this LCD TV to my mother as a throwaway gift. The picture is just not as crisp as a plasma's picture. The display of non-HD programming was also disappointing. With all of the TV's great reviews, including one from Consumers Reports, I expected more. Maybe I expected too much. If you have a plasma TV now, dont downgrade to this TV! The TV does have a good menu, decent sound and a good remote control. A TV like this one might be okay in the bedroom, but it is surely not a living room TV. Its not a dog, its just not a Cadillac either."
4,Great Stuff,"Another great album by an artist who, by rights, probably shouldn't HAVE great albums. Repeated listening doesn't change my mind - this guy was fantastic (Well, ""IS"" fantastic - he has a new album!). The ""Save the Whale"" song is a bit clunky, but hey, it's last - take off the CD early. PS - anyone know what the heck ""The Riddle"" is supposed to be about?"
1,HE NEEDS THERAPY; AWFUL SPECULATION,"Awful speculation on his part. Someone, somewhere, told him that this book would invoke some emotional response, and he gets off on invoking emotional responses, without really saying anything much at all. He appears to be UNSUCCESSFULLY working through the issues he has with Caucasian people, and with himself in this book, and his energy would be much better placed in him scheduling an appointment to work through his issues in therapy. In essence he is insulting women and in particular Caucasian women, by generalizing and minimizing relationships to some mere conversations he's had with some insecure and out of touch peers, girlfriends, or ex-girlfriends. Schedule the appointment, you really need it."
1,"This book was ghostwritten by TV's George Jefferson.....""whitey"" hating crap","Maybe black men and white women just like each other. Much the same way that white men and asian women seem to. Maybe there arent sick evil honkey devil forces at work here. The hand of George Jefferson is all over this thing. I really expected her to have a chapter on ""zebras"" the unholy product of these unions. Yes the white man is out to destroy the black family and this ti me he is using the most tender of traps, white women. GROW UP its 2010 and people just mix it up these days. Deal with it. If you like old fashioned honkey hating drivel and have 12$ to spend on it then go for it."
1,Lost Book,This is the first time that i have not received my purchase from Amazon.. I am still waiting for this very special book that have been recommended by so many people. I cannot rate this item at the time until i receive the item. I am waiting patiently.
2,Things that make you go hmmm...,I have reasd so many of these reviews and it makes me wonder WHO actually READ this book? 1. Rajen Persaud is a male - not a female. 2.The art on the cover of the book DOES NOT tell you what is in the book. Personally I would feel better if Mr. Persaud would disclose his own ancestry - I suspect from his photo that it plays into his decision to write the book.3. This link [...] will take you to an interview with Persaud so you can hear him discuss what his reasons are for writing the book.4. His primary reason appears to be that he found a subject that would get his sales up higher than his previous books.5. There is little that is back up with empirical evidence or even can be shown to be factual in this book so if you want one (more) man's opinion on this subject spend your money.
1,Incredibly Poor,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The author brings nothing new to the discussion of interracial relationships. There is no consistency to his logic and his ""humor"" is mean-spirited, bitter and most importantly, not funny. He has a very fine opinion of himself, which he never hesitates to share with the reader. This is a perfect example of a book being sold by its cover alone. The ""author"" is apparently getting people to buy the book based on it's provocative title alone. I guess he did one thing right when putting this trash together. Awesomely awful. One star is one star too many."
4,"Blacks just need to stop complaining, right?",I would venture to guess that the majority of those who have given negative reviews have been white.How often I have heard similar criticism by whites whenever a person of color or other minority presents a point of view that challenges their perceptions of themselves as heroic and ideal.I think we all need to take the time to understand the underpinnings of racism in America. Problems don't just disappear because we ignore them.
4,You'll Love it!! I did!,"""Why Black Men love White Women"" is an excellent book dealing with some of the deep seated issues that African Americans have towards one another due to the conditioning of Slavery, Jim Crow, the Media etc... I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to explore these issues. He gives an excellent analysis of how Black people are portrayed in movies, in songs, literature etc. Its funny. Its sad. Its informative! It is definately a must read!"
1,Just Plain Sad,"I was impressed with the author's writing style, his obvious intelligence.......but his total lack of the human need for love without regard for skin color exposed a venomous nature. He is an angry, vindictive man and I hope his vengeful spirit is only expressed in the written word."
1,what if i married a asian women,"I thought I loved my wife for same reasons everybody else does. Does every person who loves outside there race suffer some mental condition or is just when a black man marries a white women. If I married a asian women or a Kenyan women would that mean i really loved her. I'm surprised the author is even attracted to black men. she implies their just simple and shiftless as supremecists' always implied. My indian buddy married a thai girl. What does that mean? He does like thai food alot.The best mate for her must definitely be non-black. then she'd know it's real.Most of my male black friends assume white male black women are together for the same genuine, materialistic or superficial reasons all folks marry each other. They split for the same reasons too.Including the one (I suspect) who left her.ct"
2,"Interesting, but no.","In terms of reading interesting cultural information, Mr. Persaud definitely presented it in this work. However, his opinions are a bit extreme to me and based on reading his book, I've concluded that the question asked cannot be answered, and I honestly think we need to advance enough as a people to not have to ask it. People are different, and to classify them, especially in the manner that he has, is just wrong and extremely judgemental."
3,The title alone raises more questions...,"Do today's Black men even have the capacity to love women anymore, regardless of their ethicity? Certainly, it seems that many of them don't harbor much affection for Black women. I haven't read this book, but I don't need to in order to figure out where its going. This book is either an exercise in futility or an attempt to generate book sales using a controversial topic...or perhaps, both. Either way, the author is obviously attempting to fan the flames, not try to extinguish them."
2,Racism seems to still exist.,"This book seemed to tell the African American male to stick with their own kind; i.e., the African American female. I was hoping that this book was dealing with good issues, like how to date as interracial couples. In my family, we were brought up to love everyone. We never taught our children or our children's children about racism; it's something they learned in school. So this book made me upset thinking that the author didn't want black men dating outside their own race. The world lives with sin every day; but we can stop racism if the parents will stop teaching their children to 'hate' but rather, love all people. No matter what race, color, creed, etc...I really wanted to know how to love another race, because in my family we have African American's, Oriental, and Hispanic. We love everyone. I wanted to see what it was like knowing that black men were dating whites; but this is not what it was about."
1,Inside 3d studio max 3,i am writing this reveiw because i feel i need to warn peaple that this book is not good reading at first i thought it was my intelagence but no this book has been writen in sutch a way that you have to guess what the author is thinking for example the first lofting exersize not one of my freinds new what was going on and had to try and guess the procedure and failed then its starts going on about subjects it thinks you allready know if that was the case you would not need to buy the book. All in all this is a badly writen book and very confuseing not for the absolute begginer
4,Great price...saved $ too ordering youth XL instead of small men's,"The shirt was really nice and my son loved it. The quality was very good. My son REALLY wanted a Brady New England Patriots shirt for his birthday. I was ready to die when I saw the prices of these type of shirts...extortion...no wonder these players make a fortune. I almost said ""fr ged aboud it"" it until I shopped Amazon and found this youth XL shirt. It was about 1/2 price of a mens small. My son is about 5'10"" and very slim. Fit him perfect.NOTE TO NFL: get a conscience and let go of the greed factor before you turn your supports away....forever!"
2,BLUE PATRIOTS JERSEY,THE LETTERING IS VERY POOR COMPARED TO OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS.MOST OF THE OTHER ( 4 TOTAL ) JERSEYS WITHSTAND MANY WASHES BEFORE SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF DETERIORATING. THIS PRODUCT BEGAN LOSING IT'S LETTER AFTER THE FIRST WASH !!!1WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY !
5,bought for my teen daughter,"I bought the youth extra large for my teenage daughter to wear, and it fit perfectly. The jersey is well made, and all the lettering and patches are sewn on, not iron ons. I was impressed with the quality, although it seemed to take forever to arrive in the mail. My daughter loved it, and I felt it was a much better deal than the adult sizes for the same thing."
3,Tortoise and the hair,"Awesome concept,really good start but the more you get into it the more it looses substance till all your left with is an awful climax and an awful conclusion."
4,Fasten your seat belt....,"I have aread a lot of the lady's short fiction in various zines and horror magazines like ""Flesh & Blood,"" and when she puts her mind to it, Monica can kick serious [rear]. This book is nasty, dark, visceral and shocking. Take aim, release the safety and go get some!"
2,Not Much Going On,"I was first introduced to Monica O'Rourke when she co-wrote a book with author Wrath James White, so I decided to see what she could do on her own. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. Yeah, it has a few grossout moments and some graphic violence, but it's written with such little buildup and suspense, it loses it's intended effect. For such a short novel, I was also surprised at the number of typos the book has. It has a few decent bits here and there -- I enjoyed the diaper scene for some twisted reason -- but I can't recommend this mainly because of the lack of story. Wait, that's not fair, there is a story -- a crazy man has decided that sex and torture are a fast way for overweight women to lose weight so he puts it upon himself to help them shed some pounds. Huh? Yeah. That's the story."
2,"Pretty gross, but I can say I read it","Hmmmm... this book was recommended to me by Amazon because I enjoy Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho & movies like Audition, Ichi the Killer, Irreverisble, & Natural Born Killers. So when this book was recommened and I read it's reviews & plot outline, I thought-- give 'er hell. I can say I read it. I will probably not read it again. In fact, it grosses me out to have it in my house. I keep lending it to friends to keep it out of my house.Was it worth it? Like I said, it's one of those things where you can say ""Ew, I read that."" My friends who borrowed it wonder what the hell is wrong with me.Parts were sickening, parts were kinda a turn on for me, the end was almost unbearable. Some female enpowerment moments at the end. Mostly over the top & not necessary. Am I afraid of the dark now? Nope.Give it a try if you seem to be like me. You can say you did."
4,Classic example of the genre,"""Manhattan Melodrama"" is almost more interesting for the ""story behind the story."" John Dillinger, a Myrna Loy fan, was killed immediately after seeing this movie in Chicago. The Powell/Loy magic is very much in evidence here, and Clark Gable is at his peak. Lots of fun!"
5,Manhattan Melodrama,"This is a good movie. I would never had thought about watching it, until the movie Public Enemy came out with Johnny Depp."
4,His last film,"Besides being a great film starring William Powell and Clark Gable, it was the last film that John Dillinger saw. After viewing the film at the Biograph Theater in Chicago, Dillinger walked outside with ""The Woman In Red"" and into the sights of Melvin Purvis.Dillinger was killed just south of the theater in the alley."
2,Sometimes it's better to forget,"This book mainly collects a number of Crowley's letters written to Kenneth Grant from the end of 1944 till spring 1946 Common Era. Grant adds a few explanatory remarks here and there. The book is large (approximately A4), but only some 70 pages thick, and space isn't used very economically. It definitely isn't worth the price. There are a few interesting thought and a few interesting pictures, but all in all it doesn't deliver what is promised. It only gives a sketchy impression of what went on between Crowley and Grant, who was 20 years old in 1944.The letters are mostly demands from Crowley, e.g. telling Grant to get him whiskey or tobacco, which were scarce due to the war. Grant is promised a position in the British OTO if he does his chores, but he doesn't obey the Master. It's all too trivial to be of interest to anyone but the Crowley fetishist."
1,Happy New Year Charlie Brown is NOT included as bonus feature,"We ordered this because we wanted to replace our old VHS version of ""Happy New Year Charlie Brown"". The Amazon description lists that ""Happy New Year"" is the Bonus feature with ""I want a Dog for Christmas Charlie Brown"".The DVD we received is not a deluxe edition as advertised. Happy New Year Charlie Brown is NOT included as bonus feature. Needless to say, we are disappointed."
2,Terrible,"Saw this on ABC. My daughter loves the Charlie Brown specials just as I did, and still do. This one is a newer production, 2003, and it falls way short of the originals. This one is overly PC and lacks the charm of the original. My daughter lost interest almost instantly. I lost interest just as quickly. My reaction 5 minutes into the show was, ""What is this crap?""Watch any other Charlie Brown special instead of this."
1,Not a good movie,This was the worse snoopy I ever saw! It bashes dogs and makes you not want one. It is not what a real dog would be. Stupid movie!! Wish I would have never gotten it!
4,In my 40's and still love it,"I'm in my 40's and still love Snoopy and the whole Peanuts gang. In this movie ReRun decides he wants a dog. Since he is not allowed to, he decides he will play with Snoopy. If you have watched any Snoopy movies or read the comics, we all know Snoopy is not your average dog. There is a part where ""harassment"" is mentioned. No worry - even if you are watching it with children of all ages, it isn't in a way that you would have to explain the birds and the bees to them. He just asked her to go to Paris and gets suspended for harassment. I would still consider this a family movie that eveyone would enjoy."
1,horrible!,"I have a pitbull boxer mix who is definitely a chewer and likes to play. I bought this at the local Gabe's for $2.99. It lasted (honestly) 2 minutes. Charlie was able to bite a big hole through the side. The squeaker wasn't very strong--you had to squeeze it in the right place. I guess I got what I paid for, but I would definitely not recommend it."
5,MFK Fisher defined writing about food before it was cool,"MFK Fisher's writings are now surfacing in popularity again - how wonderful. Her books and stories are a synthesis of food, tastes, moods, a bit of travelogue, some history. Her works - not just this one - are must reading, regardless if you are foodie or not."
5,fabulous,"Ihave to say that this book rates as one of my favorite books. Ms Fisher writes with so much wit and intelligence. This book (or set of books really),is more than a book about eating, its a book about everything important - love, good times, bad times, and about the art of making the very best of what you have."
5,The Art of Eating,A wonderful book which arrived in perfect condition in a timely fashion. I am a very satisfied customer--the book's recipient was delighted.
3,A mid-century perspective on food,"I thought this book was interesting. Our book group also read ""The Omnivore's Dilemina"". She brings a post WWII perspective to food.The tomato soup cake was OK.We had our meeting and each made something from the book. The author had an interesting life and has written many other books so it was a good discussion."
3,good to know,"execpt songs by Jackson Browne,The Psychedelic Furs,bonnie taylor and the weather girls the other bands are almost unheard of and maybe heres our chance to take a listen to their hits and is REO speed wagon in this hits as well?"
5,FREAKIN AWESOME!,"I'd already heard some of this band's songs, and i've been a fan of them for a little over a year now, but i finally got my hands on this CD. I really enjoy it because, first off, Jani Stefonavic is one of the members of this band, and as expected from him due to his numerous other projects that he oversees, this album is some serious true metal. It offers the seven-string heaviness of the other bands Stefanovic is in (Divinefire, Miseration, formerly Renascent) with the powerful vocals of Christian Palin (also of Random Eyes), and some Meshuggah-esque odd/compound time rythyms along with some instances of polyrythmic drumming (also recorded by Stefanovic, now performed by Rolfe Pilve). The best way to sum it up would be 80's metal with seven string guitars and odd rythyms."
3,Ok,"Again, I watched this as a kid so I decided to buy them for my kids to see and they really.like it."
3,They Were all good,"I enjoyed this boxed set of 4 books, but I thought they could have been a bit longer. My favorite's were numbers 3 and 4, Playing with Fire and Power Play. This would be a good introduction to the SVH series."
4,"GREAT selection, party up and enjoyable listening","Great selection by ""DA HOUSECAT"" not a lot of fresh tunes but the ones well selected to have an enjoyable time listening or parting, The mixing is not such extended but still its all about the music. Will spank your spekers at good level so make part of your collection"
5,"There's a joy in serving, God!!!","I am just ordering the cd and don't know if the rest of it is good or not-really don't care! There is SUCH an annointing in the song-""There's A Joy In Serving God""that it has to be worth the purchase price. I will be using the song in a group that I plan to do in the forensic mental hospital that I work in. There are hopeless, directionless people there who need to know-""There's A Joy In Serving God"". If I can convey this to them, I'm sure that they won't spend twenty more years behind the wall. Yeh Jai, you're annointed for a purpose and I thank you for sharing your ministrey with me and mine!"
1,Borderline Horrible,"One of the worst albums I have ever purchased - has a very.....amature feel to it. The first song is EXCELLENT, then it just goes downhill - horribly produced, nothing new or unique, just bad background vocals, horrible arrangenemts, and nothing worth remembering.....Except the first song - much respect."
5,Amazing reading of French repertoire.,It is amazing that an Estonian conductor and a Scandinavian orchestra can play French music with such sense of style! Recommended!
4,Good but dated set of articles,"This is a nice collection of articles printed in Fine Homebuilding. Most of the articles are 10+ years old at the time of this review. Because they are articles that address specific issues by a builder/craftsman/contractor they do not present a comprehensive approach to any window issue, nor do they present a survey of the field. Nonetheless, if you are looking for some practical advice there is much to be found here."
3,solo trombone,"I liked the variety on this cd although some of the selections seemed a little too ""artsy"" for my taste. overall I am quite satisfied with content and virtuosity displayed by the soloist!"
3,Amber Thong,"Again, the Dereon brand shoe seems to be very cheaply made. These shoes were comfortable, but they have a cheap feel to them."
5,MM951 Seat motor assembly,"As mentioned by other reviewers this is a complete ready to install three motor assembly, not just a single motor. This does not include any seat tracks.The install is easy, though time consuming. The install took place on my 80K mile '03 Lincoln Town Car's drivers side seat. The lower RH side seat rail and the relay computer both must be removed to gain the room necessary to remove the old motor assembly and install the new unit. Don't forget that there are two Torx fasteners holding the assembly to the LH side rail. Aside from that there isn't much in the way of replacing the motors under the seat.Overall I am impressed with the unit for the price paid."
3,Not Bad,"I have one of these I've used for years and needed a new one finally. The pop out feature is nice for cleaning, but I find that the roller seems to pick up everything you don't want on there and then it is kind of hard to get clean."
3,Extraterritoriality in China explained,"Keeton, in a very detailed book, provides a full history of extraterritoriality in China up to 1928. There are a number of chapters on the development of British extraterritoriality jurisdiction, but he also provides details of the treaties and legal systems developed by other extraterritorial powers. The appendices provide a number of hard to find treaties and correspondence."
3,this book was very exciting and suspenseful.,I thought this book was kinda boring when I first started reading it. But as I progressed in reading it I realize it was good. I felt Jennifer Blake's pain. I know that happens in alot of family's so basically it was a real life situation. I would recommend this book to any and evrybody who enjoys mysteries and suspense novels.
2,A waste of my money,"I purchased this quite awhile back at the recommendation of a doctor. I was having issues falling asleep as I could not seem to ""come down"" at night from my stress filled days.In theory the device has potential and I gave it a try. But it really does not work well.I used it in the begiining quite a bit. Hoping that I would master it and my anxiety. I tried breathing techniques and meditation-type calming techniques. I found the device did not change with my heart rate or level of calmness. The biofeedback is not accurate if it works at all.I have not touched it in over a year. I feel I wasted my money on this purchase. Meditation alone would do a person much better and at no cost."
4,Dynamic Pose & Great Detail,McFarlane has effectively captured an action packed moment as this soldier moves out It's probably best to glue the figure to the base for better stability. This redeployed version is better than the original series 1 debut version.
2,Royal Hunt decieved me.,"I heard one song and thought they'd be a really cool band.However, this album is quite boring. Every song is almost exactly the same as the last, and the singer gets to be very nerve-racking.I wish I could return it, to be honest."
4,Good CD,"Good CD, but even better is the Ritchie Valens Story. It has Bob Keane doing wonderful naration of Ritchie's recording history and life. As far as ""Bluebirds Over the Mountain,"" that is not the song that comes over the radio when you learn of Ritchie's death in the movie La Bamba. The song interrupted by the radio bulletin is ""Over the Mountain and Across the Sea"" performed by Johnnie and Joe."
4,Copacabana,"I have always been a fan of the Marx Bros. and have most all their movies, This movies has only Groucho but it also has Carman Maranda. The plot is based around what might be a Marx Bros. adventure with Carman Maranda easly making up for the lack of the other brothers. I think this is an exelent movie for those who want to see Carnam Maranda and how talented she is. This movie is light harted fun and adventure and a peek into the styles of the time."
5,GROUCHO & CARMEN!!!!!,Lots of fun with two of moviedom's greats. This is an excellent DVD presentation with no quality issues and comes highly recommended.
5,a Groucho Miranda comedy wow,"a dvd of Groucho Marx and Carmen Miranda how neat. this is a fun movie with a lively plot, the only thing missing is it is in black and white. this one they should colorize it wouldn't hurt it. Carmen plays two different girls in the same nightclub and Groucho loves one and the gangster owner of the club loves the other. a traffic light was needed in this one, it goes so fast. a very funny movie."
3,Not my favorite Marx Brothers Movie,"I love watching the Marx Brothers, but this one was not as funny. I did like some of the music in it."
3,"An entertaining read, but certainly not one of King's best.","The first book that I ever read by Stephen King was ""Desperation"", and from then on I couldn't stop reading his very entertaining novels. When I started reading ""The Dark Half"" I didn't have very high expectations, but I knew the 'master of horror' wouldn't let me down. He didn't, yet I have to admit it wasn't one of his better books. There were so many times the novel just seemed to drag on and bore me. The murders were very graphic, though, and the conclusion was well worth the strenuous wait."
1,I had to force myself to finish it...,"This was simply one of the worst ideas that Stephen King has had. It was way to hokey to really grasp the attention of the reader. It is understandable that King came up with this idea. If I were King, I, too, would fear that my dark half would come to life and stalk me. However, I do not think that King's, or anyone else's dark half would come out being a deteriorating wannabe badass. This book would be a wonderful B-Movie. I've not seen the movie, but the quality of this story fits the B rating. Normally I can read King's books in no time flat; it took me a month to finally force myself to finish this book. Perhaps this would be a good horror novel for someone who is just getting ready to break away from R.L. Stine."
5,One of King's most thoughtful novels,"Thad Beaumont, writer, uses a pen name, George Stark. He's horrified when, having discarded his nom de plume, he discovers that George has come to life, as the alter-ego of himself. Worse still, his alter ego is a murderer, signing his name to his atrocities and leaving Thad Beaumont to pick up the blame. Beaumont needs to trap his `twin' but, in order to do so, must first evade police observation. At last, they are alone together. Or are they? The sparrows are flying again.The Dark Half is one of King's most powerful, but under-rated, books. As usual, the narrative is filled with authoritative detail and personal reflection. This is a scary book - a book with real depth. King, as usual, writes in criminal ease and keeps his reader hooked to the end. I highly recommend it as one of King's most thought-provoking novels."
3,"Very great read, but...","it wasn't very full-throttle so to speak. The first half of the book is amazing, it's intense, suspenseful, exhilirating, and mysterious, but the latter half loses all of that. There are two climaxes in this book, and the first one is the more thrilling. I think Mr. King could have cut a lot out of this book since the second climax was not as electrifying; everything had already been revealed, no mystery, nor suspense. The last action of the book was the equivalent to taking a quarter and rubbing off the film on a scratch-and-win lottery ticket.Despite that, i do recommend the book. It's an age-old tale of Frankenstein, and shed's some light on what we create, and how other's indulge in that creation. A great companion to Misery"
2,One of King's most Uninspired Works to Date,"Being a Stephen King fan for years, I was completely disappointed when I read the first King book I didn't like (I later read Skeleton Crew, which was also quite bad). The charcters were drawn poorly, the horror was of the most generic and expected variety, and the plot was really lacking. For the first time, King writes like an amateur, and it's as if he is writing to overcome his boredom, as a time-filler. Even die-hard King fans can skip this one without remorse"
3,"Too long by ""Half""","""The Dark Half"" suffers from the same problem of many of King's later novels, the suubject matter does not justify the length. King is a masterful storyteller with a seemingly unlimited imagination. The problem is that he often takes story ideas that might make a good novella and stretches them on for six or seven hundred pages. The concept of ""The Dark Half"" is a clever one. Had it been given a more concise treatment, it would have been very effective indeed."
2,Decide to Quit King After This One,A short story made long with endless and cumbersome writing. There may be a good story here but King missed it. Years went by before I was talked into reading King again. That book was Insomnia. Haven't read King since. Shame since I used to read everything he wrote.
5,Couldn't put it down,"I read this book 10 years ago (when I was in high school). It's a good read...and it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. HOWEVER...I do have one bone to pick. I was very disappointed with the ending. The book was very witty and clever...so I thought the ending would also be clever. It's almost like King didn't know the ending until he got there and the ending was just an after thought. Even with the ending, I give this book 5 stars, and I recommend it. I also recommend ""On Writing"" ""The Shining"" ""Misery"" ""The Talisman/Black House"" & ""The Dark Tower Series"" by this author. I did not like ""the tommyknockers"" at all....but that was me...it just wasn't my cup of tea. In closing...Stephen King is a talented writer....which is refreshing because there are so many horrible horror/sci-fi writers out there."
1,DON'T BUY FOR KINDLE,Good lord this book is full of typos. I'm not knocking the quality of the story since it was impossible to read through all the mistakes. I'm talking typos in every single paragraph. DON'T BUY THIS KINDLE VERSION!!!
3,A good fast reading,This book is different from other King's works. The plot is good but the charachters are not comepletely developed. The ending is a little disapointing too. It could has been better
5,"Except maybe for The Stand, the BEST KING BOOK!",I reitirate my statement above as I feel that the Dark Half is one of his gretest achievements. He makes the reader get completely involved in the story line and brings each of his characters to life with the utmost of skill. The suspense and fear gradually increases through the plot to a climaxtic BANG right at the end. More of the same please....
4,Two are not always better than one!,"A very good fast read. Stark is a great character. King always seems to make one character in his books stand out farther than anyone else. Stark was my farorite in this one. Read the book, but stay away from the movie."
4,"Great book, but Kindle edition is terrible","""Dose"" = ""Close."" ""Comer"" = Corner. These are just a couple of the things you will have to figure out if you choose to read this book on Kindle. I love this book (it's my favorite King, in fact, which is why I purchased this Kindle copy in ADDITION to my battered paperback and my pristine hardcover signed first edition), but there's just no excuse for this. I've had a Kindle for over two years, and haven't experienced these problems with any other books. I hope future King books I buy for Kindle aren't like this, otherwise I may just end up re-reading my paperbacks instead."
3,A very below average King novel,Most SK novels grab me in the beginning few paragraphs. This one didn't and I struggled to keep my attention to it the entire way through. The story was creepy (as most of King's work is) but overall not as engaging as many other King books I've read. I'd recomment readers new to Stephen King avoid this one early on or you might get a sour taste of this great author.
4,A chilling enthrawling story.,This was the first stephen king novel I have read and i was not disappointed with the context. I was scared stiff. I would recomend this book to any reader not just horror readers.
2,WAY too long!!,"When I started this book, it was pretty good, but it just dragged on too long. During the second half of the book, I already knew what was going to happen and it got so boring that I didn't even finish it."
2,Graphic and very gross murders not for the fainthearted,"Ok i love King and most of his novels. But never has he gotten so possesed in his overgrowing pass ion for gore. The murders are to geraphic, and the ending is just to wierd. But if you like real disguisting violent books than this one is for you.(it almost made me puke in one part)"
1,"An editor, an editor, my kingdom for an editor!!!","A note to Mr. King: Just because a story idea can be written as a novel doesn't mean that it should be. This book has no business being a novel. There simply isn't enough material here for much more than a really good novella. Don't get me wrong. I have read and enjoyed many of King's works. But far too many of them, beginning with this one, are little more than inflated short stories. King is best writing good, short, nasty stories of people doing terrible things to each other, like The Shining, Pet Sematary, Christine, Carrie, Delores Claiborne, etc. His big novels (like Salem's Lot, IT, and the ridiculously overpraised The Stand) soon become predictable, and downright boring. The Dark Half has one or two cool moments, but it is the last King novel I will read, at least until he learns (or remembers) that there is more to writing than filling up paper."
3,mam,When I ordered the book it read that its condition was excelent and new but when I received it the cover was wrinkled and bent up and the pages were yellowed. I wanted to give this as a Christmas gift.
3,Shallow King,"A rare three-star effort from Stephen King, the problem with THE DARK HALF is the semi-serious tone of the author. It's like he's acknowledging the absurdity of the plot and that the whole thing is really a metaphor for the relationship of an author to his works (and characters). And these characters are unusually shallow for a King novel. Compare this to the believability of BAG OF BONES--now that's a novel where King seems to care deeply about his characters and he skillfully grounds the fantastical elements of the book in a rich sense of reality. All of that is missing here."
5,Entertaining Book,I don't read much Stephen King but I found this book entertaining and wasn't always quite sure where he was taking me. A good read that I enjoyed.
4,"Stretches credulity even more than usual for King, but...","King entertains and enthralls in moments of The Dark Half, too. That Beaumont, the college professor type, and George Stark, a rough Mississippi boy... King is playing with dualities here, different facets of our selves, repressed parts of the psyche... If you like most of King you will probably enjoy this; if you are iffy on King, then maybe you should go to one of the classics like Dead Zone, Shining, Cujo, Firestarter, etc..."
1,Somewhat useless,"This book is about as useful as the Crystal Reports documentation. If you need to know how to do something this book will not help you.E.G. If you want to know how to use a built in function, it will tell you no more than the Crystal manual, which is basically what it does, not how to do it.Don't waste your money."
2,Weight seems more important than content,I find this book difficult to use as a reference. I code in VB and use the RDC and automation server elements a great deal. When looking for solutions to my problems I have found the explanations verbose and frequently lacking the content I need. Finding things in the index is also difficult (e.g. anything to do with asynchronous processing).
4,Solid book to gain a better understanding of CR,"I purchased this book for a specific job I needed to do. I have about a year of experience with CR 8, but I use it only in special circumstances. This book helped me learn what I needed to know about subreports. I skimmed some of the other chapters, and they looked pretty good. Particularly chapters geared towards SQL (14, 15, & 18). Overall, it's a good, solid book to help beginner to intermediate users gain a better understanding of CR 8."
4,"Unique, Interesting and yet incomplete","STRENGTHAs far as I know, this is the only book on domino divination available on the market. The author gives sufficient information on the 28 tiles of double-six dominoes. The glossary includes interesting details about African gods.WEAKNESSThe information about the combinations is sketchy. Many combinations such as three-six with two-six is omitted."
2,Not enough about the man.,"I eagerly awaited this book, as it was touted as THE definitive bio on arguably the greatest player in baseball history. Most of the book dealt merely with game summaries and rivalries. It wasn't until the last pages that I felt any real understanding on Wagner the man. It was a struggle to finish, and is a big disappointment"
2,Honus And The Pirates,"Well researched. Well written. It just lacked something resembling a solid base hit up the middle. I really enjoyed the history and background on the Pirates. At times I was not sure if the authors were writing a book about Tommy Leach, Fred Clarke, or Honus Wagner. Not until the end did you actually get an appreciation for Honus the man. At that, perhaps you understand why they stuck so closely to developing the story behind the Pirates rather than just Wagner. If that is all that is available about Honus, then the title of the book should have been, HONUS AND THE PIRATES. Good effort, but just another baseball history book with inconsistencies and missing information."
2,a very incomplete picture,"One lapse in the DeValerias' work is the preparation of their bibliography, which is incomplete, failing to list many works cited later under chapter sources. An examination of the bibliography, therefore, provides future researchers with a very incomplete picture of the extent of their work. Moreover, they eschew footnotes in favor of a general listing of sources for each chapter. Trying to pinpoint the source of the authors' conclusions or a particular quotation, consequently, is virtually impossible, and weighing the number of sources they used to establish a point even more frustrating. The result is often the impression that a thin foundation of a single quotation or story supports many of the DeValerias' conclusions."
2,Flying Dutchman Grounded,"If took almost 100 years for us to get Wagner biograhy. Unfortunately, we're still waiting for an effort worthy of the man universally considered the greatest shortstop ever.The main problem with the book is that it gets too bogged down in detail. It goes through tedious information, like his getting three hits in an Iron & Oil League game.Also, there's not enough about what kind of person Wagner was. Generalities are mentioned, but few specifics.In defense of the authors, it would be tough to paint a portrait of a man when there is almost no one left who knew him pesonally. Then again, with such a handicap, they probably shouldn't have tried it in the first place."
3,Provides some insights,"This work is useful for the baseball fan interested in the game's history. An enjoyable read but it falls prey to a critical error in any baseball biography -- it fails to include Wagner's career statistics. Not that you can't find them elsewhere, but most folks reading baseball history (such as myself) will want to leaf through and check out the stats as they read the narrative."
4,a fan,"I'm a fan of this author, I actually paid to read these books. Taking a break but will look forward to reading more of his books."
2,Not up to par.,"Once you have read one Joe Gunther, you can predict the story structure for all the rest. Crime happens, wrong person accused, lots of investigative work and bingo, someone else did it. The fun in reading the books is solving the puzzle. Unfortunately, this Joe Gunther did not meet the excellence of the first three. Boring is the relevant word."
2,the skeletons knee,It took a long time to get to the subject matter. Not up to the other Gunther mysteries. Not too bad though
3,"Great start, but it petered out.","The fourth installment of the Joe Gunther series has a tantalizing start - a man brought to the hospital with paralysis dies suddenly. Beth Hillstrom, medical examiner and Gunther friend, calls to say he died of an aneurysm caused by a bullet wound now nearly twenty years old. The resulting investigation unearths a decades old skeleton with a bullet wound and no identity. Transporting the skeleton becomes treacherous when the caravan is fired upon.Gunther follows the investigation to Chicago where he is a real fish out of water. The small state boy struggles in the big city but manages to move the case forward toward mob ties and hippie influences. He finally runs afoul of the Chicago PD and is asked (told) to leave. But the case is really back in Vermont.The case starts as an interesting puzzle and Gunther is worth the time, Mayor could have shortened the book by a hundred pages.Just okay."
1,A movie the actors probably want to bury from their career.,"This DVD was apparently produced by somebody at home on their computer. Label on the disc was definitely homemade. Picture quality is fuzzy; it may have been copied from a VHS tape. Sound is muffled at times. One scene skipped. Besides that, the storyline is predictable and the acting of the main actress is contrived and horrible. Very much a high school project feeling. Deborah Harry is barely in it and has little to no speaking parts. Alec Baldwin must have been just starting out in his career or suffered through the bad script as a favor to a friend. Even if these actors are your favorites, I would skip this movie and pretend it was never part of their career."
1,Avoid.,"Not ""The Lion"" disc to buy from this period. Very annoying organ work by Milt Herth. Will drive you nuts!"
2,Avoid buyer's remorse on this one,"The Chronological Classics label superbly documented early American jazz perhaps better than any other label. The company started issuing classic jazz recordings in 1989, and continued releasing new CDs until its bankruptcy in 2004. (The label, with a catalog of nearly 1000 albums, was distributed by a new owner until 2008.)Issuing recordings in chronological order can have its pitfalls. Here, all but 4 of the 25 selections feature the Hammond organ playing of Milt Herth. Sadly, the organ largely drowns out the piano work of Smith. Moreover, Herth's organ work will have little appeal to most modern ears.There are four excellent Smith tracks without organ. But, only the most dedicated of Willie Smith completists would spend money AND listen to the complete CD. The CD might appeal more to those interested in the early history of the Hammond organ in jazz; and those people should search out the organ work of Fats Waller as well."
5,Super Session!,"I found this in a used cd bin. An unexpected found treasure. Recorded in France in 1989 with a stellar cast: Jackie McLean, Johnny Griffin, Cecil Payne, Duke Jordan, Ron Carter and Roy Haynes. Can't really top that group. Essentially a blowing session with great material. No liner notes, but solos on each cut are indicated.My copy says ""Volume 1"" I have not been able to find Volume 2, so this may be it. I will keep searching.Jeano"
3,VINTAGE Revisited,"This is a re-release of the Association,s 1983 ""Vintage"" album with six of the seven present (for obvious reasons, Brian Cole was not present). This is a decent re-make of some of the groups popular hits with tight harmonies on other 70's hits. I personally preferred ""You're In My Heart"" and ""Do That To Me One More Time"". Although I did not care for the updated version of ""Windy"", even that came to be listenable with time. However,when the album was released they mislabeled ""Goodbye Columbus"" as ""It'a Lucky Day"" (a pretty shabby mistake). All in all, a passable collection."
5,Gorgeous album!,"Dan Laurin's playing on this CD is truly remarkable. It is not only a wonderful showcase for recorder as an instrument, but it manages to make the most of Vivaldi's writing."
5,reviews for two different albums run together.,"Amazon has the reviews for two different products run together. This album actually was recorded on a sopranino. I seem to be in the minority, but I actually like the sound of a cute little sopranino.The musicianship is wonderful, as it is on all Dan Laurin albums.Bach Collegium = sopraninoDrottningholm Baroque Ensemble = altoBoth albums are discussed on Mr. Laurin's website. He generally does not like playing the sopranino, and had one made for this album.I love both albums."
1,Buy ANY other version,"This version of the three little pigs has the STUPIDEST placement of illustrations -- there's no picture of the straw house, five pages worth of pictures of a part of the story I have never even heard of before, no picture of the two pigs running to their brother's house, no picture of the wolf blowing down the straw house, NO picture of huffing or puffing at all. My three year old keeps asking me what the straw house looks like, or what a kettle of boiling water is. The illustrations themselves are attractive enough -- the selections of which scenes to illustrate is downright moronic and frustrates me every time I attempt to read it again."
5,The Three Little Pigs,"This is the latest addition to the ""Little Golden Book"" collection that I have purchased for my twin grandchildren. They totally loved the story. We have almost read the print off the pages and still they continue to ask me to read it again. They cheer for the little pig in the brick house and enjoy singing the ""Big Bad Wolf"" song. They look on the back cover of the book and ""remind"" me which ""Golden Books"" we are missing and need to add to our library.These are the same stories that I read to my children that helped encourage their love of reading. I am very happy that ""Little Goldne Books"" have continued to be publiched through the years."
2,Not very good,"This book does not contain very important pictures such as the straw house, the wolf puffing...etc I reccomend it to collectors, because is a very interesting book, but if you are a teacher, and you need it for working, this is not the correct book..."
3,3 Little Pigs,"There are many, many other books of higher quality than this book. It serves as a fine nostalgic reminder, but a personal retellingis probably a better idea."
3,Cheaply Made,These books were very cheaply made. The paper was cut longer than the cover and it just looks cheap. The price was cheap though so I guess you get what you pay for.
4,another favorite,"Purchased this book when I purchased The Three Bears, I will read this to my grandbabies as I did my children."
4,The Deep Water Of The North Atlantic Is A Home For Terror,"The Reach is a thoroughly enjoyable book in that it tells two stories separated by 130 years which meet in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean by means of very determind and equally as vindictive long dead souls called The Dead Ones. In 1860, a young English girl is returning home to England on a ship which is slolwy sailing into the grasps of The Dead Ones from far below. In 1990, two men sail the exact same route and what they find is terrifying. I love sailing and the ocean but after reading The Reach am going to think twice before getting into even a swimming pool!"
4,"The Reach, by Sprague Theobald","This first book by former America's Cup sailor Sprague Theobald succeeds on more than one level. Anyone who has ever lived in a resort town will appreciate his description of how it feels when the tourists (finally!) leave for the season.It's clear that Mr. Theobald has a deep, spiritual affinity with the ocean, and his writing about the sea rings true and touching. His characters, particularly the sister of the main character, are well drawn. The blend of history, suspense, humor and mystery, is unusual and successful.Definitely worth it, and not only for the armchair sailor.B.F. Roberts Newport, Rhode Island"
4,Good for the price.,"We have several Shuns, and they are a cheaper alternative to Hattori. They might be worth what you pay, but are not the best out there, as some have declared. And the price keeps creeping up, making them less attractive for the quality they offer. They use VG10 steel, but it is not as finely tempered as the Hattori line, so does not take or hold an edge as well. The plus side is that they take a beating better than a Hattori or similar quality Japanese knife. This makes them a decent knife for one who is a little rough on knives, nicking them on bones, etc. They, like other top Japanese knives, need to be sharpened at 12 to 15 degrees to get the best performance. This negates their use for heavier use, so a traditional 20 degree knife needs to be kept as well. The Spanish Henckels or Forschners do this well for a lot less money.They are available for lefties, too, but you have to ask or special order them."
4,They Forgot to Mention the Plot,"Weekend Warriors consists of the wacky members of the Hollywood Air Force. Top-starred is Chris Lemmon who with his buddies -- including a dumb but sweet boxer and a popular doo-wop trio -- must ace an inspection they are not close to being prepared for and thus avoid call-up and deployment overseas during a heating up of the Berlin confrontation. In response, they call on their buddies, Hollywood professionls, to dazzle the visiting dignitaries (including some unexpected Iron Curtain diplomats) with a performance substituting for actual readiness. Cracks me up every time I see it. Lloyd Bridges is a Western actor (his horse has the talent) who heads the unit and must be made to cooperate."
5,Great Old Movie,"Remembered this from my 80's teenage years. Funny and just good old, silly humor that was lost with more recent films."
5,Educational and beautiful,"It is never too early to educate children in the ways of the world, and ""Tibet - Through the Red Box"" does so with beauty and compassion. Labeling something as ""political"" (as if that was automatically a negative) and discarding it for that reason is symptomatic of the thinking that has kept Tibet repressed for so long. When a story is as moving and as beautifully illustrated as this one, it is the perfect vehicle to introduce children to new ideas, and should be held up as a model rather than kept away from the little darlings. I know my children will benefit greatly from reading books that open their minds and expose them to new thoughts and new cultures, and once our children benefit from that intellectual process, we all benefit."
5,wonderful,"I originally bought the bought mainly because of its Asian theme, a subject my younger child is currently fascinated with. However, what was most compelling about it was not the subject but the perspective. It is through those Czechoslovakian eyes that the cultural experience became special: my son was not merely looking at Tibet from his perspective but was at the same time looking at a certain Czechoslovakia through Tibet's mirror."
3,Nice but must have nickel in them,"I like these earrings, but they tend to itch, so there may be some nickel in them. Otherwise I like them."
5,Seattle represents,"Spyplane is a local Seattle band that played quite a few local venues and even saw some radio play on KEXP in the mid 2000's. They have since broken up, with members going to 'Low-Fi' and 'The Glasses'. I saw them play a couple times and always really enjoyed it. I bought 'Communications are Down' at one of their shows and have been enjoying the record ever since. The record is full of catchy well written indy pop songs that you can't help but singing along to. The intricate guitar arrangements are definitly a highlight of the record. The guitar player also played in 'The Glasses' which is another Seattle band that I recommend listening to. Overall an excellent effort."
4,It was worth the wait!,"It has been difficult to find this book in stock. It has been eluding this reader for months. Finally, I've had the good fortune to track it down and have one in my possession. This is a _must_ have volume for the connoisseur's library: practical advise, real world issues, expertly presented. Miss Abernathy's Concise Slave Training Manual addresses this special human endeavor with pragmatism delivered with an exemplary writing style. The BDSM resource guide in the back of the book is a valued utility in and of itself. I will reiterate: it was worth the wait!"
5,Simply Delicious,i thoroughy enjoyed this book. soft sweet and luscious just like a good pet a great beginner book exploring lifestyle issues and has wonderful suggestions and does not take life to seriously and helps you enjoy the pleasure of it all
3,Concise Indeed,"This book is in fact very well written and very concise. However, I was disappointed by it. I came to the book with questions about consensual slavery and the practice thereof that were not answered. Instead, I read a very short and very witty and warm overview of just about everything I already knew--maybe a little less, and I am not all that knowledgeable. Her workbook was more informative, and that is the one that I read first, which helped me form so many of my questions, but the format is not one which will directly answer the questions of an owner, since it is written mainly for the unowned slave."
2,A condensed copy of Erotic Slavehood,"First, let me say I don't dislike this book because it is only 86 pages and cost me almost 40.00 dollars. What I disliked about this book is that it was only a condensed version of Erotic Slavehood which only cost me 10.00 dollars and has 223 pages.If I had known that before I purchased the book I would have saved myself some money and put it on another book.The information is great but don't waste your money get Erotic Slavehood which was also written by Miss Abernathy and gives you more information to help you rather you are a slave or Dominant."
1,Not very informative.,I had read other reviews before purchasing the book but was disappointed with the book. Several friends read it as well and their opinions reflected my own.
2,Slightly disappointed,"This is a basic how-to manual for setting up a woman run home. Covers all the basics if you know absolutely nothing, but this is not an erotic journal for bedtime reading. It reminded me of an 78 page dog training book."
2,Very good but lacking in real life information,This book describes the fantasy of female domination very well but does not go into the emotional reality.. that which most really seek and need. I'd like to see Goddess Dianna Vesta write a book about these topics. She is the expert on these subjects. Where is her book?
5,A Maxwell created the science fiction/romance genre!,"As an avid Ann Maxwell fan, I was pleased to come upon this science fiction romance. Ms. Maxwell was writing this genre ahead of its time and I hope she will again write in this genre. Strong character/plot development leaves you engrossed in the not improbable hysteria of a futuristic Earth and some of its ""talented"" citizens. The heroine is in a constant state of ""change"" and deals with it. No wimpy heroines for Ms. Maxwell and only a fantastic read for her fans!"
2,Disappointed Again,I bought this for my two year old. He has aproxia of speech so we are teaching him sign language. I thought it was simple enough to keep his attention but the signs are not correct. I do not want to teach him the wrong signs because he may never be able to communicate like most of us do. I was disappointed to say the least. This was the second book I bought from this line :(
1,Just So-So,"I couldn't wait for this book to end because of the time I'd already invested in it. I cannot believe that many women would drink & smoke marijuana, and yet, they supposedly have their children with them. Oh yeah, I forgot, the children did put one of the kids in the dryer for a spin under the zoned out mommies watch. The only one I really felt commpassion for was Merit, and maybe a little for Faith. The one character I probably liked the best was Kari, and it seemed that we did not really get to know her.I really think the author tried to cram too many issues into one book. It just got a little too boring. I also lived through that era. These ladies were not like the majority of the people I was and have been best friends with for 30 to 40 years."
4,I usually avoid this kind of book -- Glad I didn't,"I have learned to avoid those books about groups of women who bond over years (and often over books and in book clubs) like the plague. However, for some reason, I actually read this one-- and liked it! The story spans from the 60's to the present day (or at least present day when published) and really rides the ups and downs of life. Nothing melodramatic or stunningly shocking-- just real. And there actually is talk of books! One of my favorite parts was that each chapter (told from the perspective of a different member of AHEB- the name of the book club the women form) gives the title of a book, and often a line or so why it was chosen."
4,for my book club...,"Very interesting book, look forward to reading others by this author! Subject matter is a departure from my usual stuff, but a good change of pace."
2,very beachy-read,"Reminded me of the Wednesday Sisters. It was a light read, very quick to get through. Predictable but not dissappointingly so."
3,Interesting look at the past few decades,"I read this book as the first item in my new book club. It was fun to read a book for a book club about a book club, but I found some of the characters to be pretty one-dimensional as was the representation of the different decades. I found it a little difficult to keep up with who was the first person in each of the chapters, so I had to flip back periodically. That said, I did enjoy reading it, and it's a quick read."
3,"Light read, but entertaining and full of color!","Yes, this book is probably considered a light read (thus my 3 star rating), but still, I did get attached to each character and was sad to finish the book. This is a story of five women who represent many different personalities, and life experiences, yet the author shows how they can actually compliment each other and survive years of friendship. The title is actually a bit misleading in my opinion, because it does not describe the women themselves, but is the name of their bookclub one of the husbands branded them with in one of his mocking tirades. I must say, this book had me envious for a bookclub with this much color and life!So what that there are unrealistically easy resolutions to difficult circumstances? It felt like a pleasant diversion from all the other all-too-realistic books I read."
5,angry house wives eating bon bons,"A good read about womens friendships who create a lifelong bond between them. The story is heartwarming, uplifting and inspiring. The story spans 40 years as the women smoke, drink and bond."
3,"Not Awful, not Great","It seems that most people hate it or love it. I liked it. I lived through the 60's--so maybe I'm bored with that decade now. I kept waiting for the book to get to the 70's. I think the AHEBB's was cleverly put together and I appreciated how the book titles fit the characters who chose them. I think I'll keep this book so that I can read or re-read some of the books mentioned.Some of the children were ridiculously precocious--way beyond belief.This book doesn't have the heart of The Secret Life of Bees or the charm of The Five People You Meet in Heaven, but it's worth reading."
5,Best Book since Patty Jane's House of Curl,"I have read all her books and LOVED this one, it would make a great movie. It's interesting that Amazon.com would offer to sell it with Fanny Flagg, because the writing style is very similiar. This is the kind of book I buy and then put on my self to enjoy again."
2,Most of it was satisfactory,"I was making my way through this book, being moderately amused, when I was assaulted by the passage about the brothers experience in Vietnam. As a young Asian female I felt offended by the heinous images brought to mind and I will no longer be purchasing this authors work. This was a mediocre read and the end was not rewarding enough to justify the effort put forth to read the entire book."
4,Very entertaining,"I enjoyed this book from start to finish. I liked seeing the friendships grow over the years and how the friends helped each other through the crisis' the encountered throughout the years. It was even nice when the author introduced new characters into the mix such as Grant or Mr. Paradise. This is the first book of Ms. Landvik's that I've read, but it won't be the last."
1,Trite is right!,I got about half way through and flipped to the end. It was not worth the effort to finish. Cute title that did not live up to expectations.
3,"Not what I expected, but","It wasn't ""laugh out loud"" like some of the reviews stated. It took me awhile to read it without that expectation. However, we had great discussion in bookclub. So all in all, I enjoyed it."
3,A Book That Needs Patient Readers,"This book was selected for a monthly book club, to be discussed in September. I admit to being unsure of it at the time it was selected, and beginning the book did not bolster my opinion. But I continued to read and found it more acceptable as the pages turned. After completing it and looking back over the story, I valued the way the book became more likeable as the characters aged. Being a senior myself certainly influenced my opinion. It was a well-written flow of changing life behaviours and thought patterns with increasing age. It was worth the reading time."
5,Best book I've read in a while!,"I laughed, I cried. I loved!I recommend this book for daughters, mothers, grandmothers. Kick back to the basics of life."
3,Disappointment,"I have read all of Lorna Landvik's books. It all started when I bought ""Patty Jane's House of Curl"" on a whim, and loved it. I have to say that I still think that one is Landvik's best, all the newer ones have disappointed me to varying degrees. Not that this book was awful or anything, but I never did get very interested in the characters."
2,"Trite, Predictable & Trite","Cliche, Predictable & TritePoorly developed characters are thrown together with a 'book club' tacked on I could not relate to any of the persons in this book, male or female. Sappy names like Merit, Slip and Faith-all on the same street- and a host of stereotypical situations insulted my intelligence as a reader. The flashbacks are even worse than the present. I found myself not caring about the characters, and didn't care for how men were portrayed. Personal interaction seemed superficial. Try the Jane Austen Book Club instead. It was much more successful in tackleing the easy plane ride/beach read."
5,Great Book,"I bought this book for something to read in the sauna at the gym. Wanted something different from my usual murder mysteries. Something light. The book started kinda slow but after a few chapters picked up. It picked up to the point I was reading outside the sauna and stayed up till 1:30 in the morning to finish it. I laughed, I cried, The more I read the more I enjoyed it. I would definately recommend this to other women as a show of the bonds of friendship and where it leads us."
3,Fun beach read...,"I enjoyed this book very much, nothing new but lots of fun. But am I the only one wondering if the creator of the five ""Desperate Housewives"" of Wisteria Lane had read about the five ""Angry Housewives"" of Freesia Court? Hmm...."
3,Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons,I read this book for a book club I recently joined. It was enjoyable but not really an in-depth read. The characters were short-changed in some situations. The author could have gone into much more detail and developed the relationships better. The members of the book club had a lively discussion about the characters and situations. We learned about each other by discussing the fictional book-club ladies. That was the best part.
4,Sweet story of friendship.,"This book tells the story of five friends, who become close by starting a book club (hence the title of the book--it's the name of their book club). The friends help each other through rough times, and are there to enjoy the good times, too. As many other reviewers have commmented on, the characters are a bit stereotypical, and the plot is also predictable at times. However, in spite of this it's still an entertaining book about friendship."
3,Easy page turner,"This is the second book we read in our newly formed book club. Surprisingly, none in our group has ever been in a book club so ""Angry Housewives"" was sort of a primer on how to run our club. This book was certainly a lighter read that our first book (""Mary Called Magdeline""), but we only really found things to complain about in our discussion. The things that happened were really over the top and the characters' reactions in many cases were not realistic. We had the most fun figuring out which character we were most like."
1,That this book was published gives hope to us all,"I won't repeat the comments already stated, though I'm not sure why some readers bothered mentioning the author's hatred of all things Republican -- a minor point at such a time -- but I will say that it was somewhere in mid-book that I realized how utterly bad this novel was. In every crisis the characters sailed smoothly through and at times benefited heavily. Who would have thought chemotherapy could improve your looks? The author didn't even have the guts to kill off one the characters. But by then we knew she had no backbone, relying as she did on the old trite metaphors and clichés of the ages with no irony to cut the sappiness. But I said I would not repeat what others have written. I'll just say this: having written trite myself, I can smell it when I read it. This book makes me rethink all those stories I've squirreled away out of embarrassment. Perhaps I should put them all together and publish them for book clubs across America.Yuck."
1,Trite Tripe,"Okay, so I was sucked in by the title. I thought this would be a fun read. I wouldn't even put this on a ""beach read"" list. It's everything you'd expect from a ""chick lit"" book but a lot less."
2,Her others are better,"I love all her books, except this one. It is a great premise, it just needs unity. Maybe like the previous person said, it probably just needed some additional editing to make it as good as her others. Knowing that she can do better, I am looking forward to her next book."
1,This felt so contrived,"Reading this book felt a little too forced. The characters are drawn so purposefully, with such radically differing personalities that it all felt like a ploy, a desperate attempt to create something meaningful that just didn't work. You can see the secrets a mile away, and they don't really have any effect when the resolution is thrust upon the reader. Each of these women is such a charicature that I had a hard time believing she could be for real -- the business with the hair was really a bit much for me.All in all, not that great a read. I wouldn't recommend the time investment -- it's just not worth it."
2,Cliche City!,There were more cliches in this book than I can even count. I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 just because it was amazing how the author could remember so many.
2,Angry Housewives.....book too many (of these).,"I did like the story line but there were too many parentheisis (of these) in the book making the reader get frustrated because by the time you would read a sentence or a paragraph, there would be another (of these) parentheisis that would throw you off the story line. It would be a good book if the author would concentrate more on the story line instead of adding more (of these) and making the story too frustrating and not smooth reading."
4,I wanna be in their book club!,"Once again, Minnesota author, Landvik has woven a tale about the strong force of female friendship. AHEB follows the lives of a group of friends through 30 years and just as many heartaches. Landvik has a gift for creating quirky characters that you just fall in love with. All their heartaches become your heartaches, and their triumphs become yours as well. I was sad when I finished the book because I knew I would miss these women! I enjoyed this book more than her last one, Welcome to the Great Mysterious, but nothing comes close to Patty Jane's House of Curl."
1,Disappointed Readers,"It was a shallow novel about paper doll women who don't exist in the real world, at least our world. This author has obviosly not spent any time researching domestic violence or interracial relationships because none of these characters faced real problems that these issues bring into one's life. We kept waiting for the author to develop a character, and in 400 pages she never did. This proud soccer mom only seemed to be right on in naming the chapters of this book, since our book club was able to salvage some titles of future reads. 'Angry Housewives' ! Where did the title come from? What were they angry about? The author didn't even tell us what happened to Slip. The book was so sugary that the author didn't have the guts to but finality to it. This book only managed to make us angry that we chose this book as this month's selection."
4,The book club I'd love to join!,"My book club has lots of fun, but this was more than just a book club.Very enjoyable with characters that were 'characters'!"
5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book.,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me, and I now know why. It reads very quickly because it is so entertaining. I want to join a book club!"
1,Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons,I found it terribly written and dull as could be. Read it as it was my Book Club's pick otherwise I would have tossed it early on. Life is too short to read a crappy book!
3,YUMMY BONBONS...,"LANDVIK DID A SUPER JOB WITH STORY STRUCTURE & VIVID CHARACTERIZATION, COMEDY & TRAGEDY. LIKE STEEL MAGNOLIAS THIS STORY CONFIRMS THAT NOTHING TRUMPS THE LOVE, THE SHARING & THE SUPPORT OF THE GIRLFRIENDS."
2,Bored reader needs a good book!,"Trite, silly, sophomoric! This choice was a summer book club selection and so I plowed through it. It is easy to read because it is simplistic and predictable. The 5 women who form this book club would be about my mother's age and they live in the Twin Cities - a place I know very well having grown up in the midwest. So I thought those 2 things might be a hook into the book, but that was a mistake. I did remember (and read) many of the books mentioned in this story - however, there was rarely a thought-provoking connection between the title being read and the actual story being told."
3,A solid C+,"I do post spoilers. Fair warning.Overall, I liked the book - the writing, the overall concept, and the characters. It had me engaged and I looked forward to the time where I got to read it.She did fit a whole lot into one book as others have mentioned and it began to feel a bit cliche. As soon as I read about Grant & Stuart, I began to beg the author - Don't play the HIV angle, don't play the HIV angle. Trust me I KNOW that HIV is a serious issue and disease and I'm not making light of it but it seems like every book/tv show/movie that has a gay couple in the 80s have to get HIV. Again, just cliche.Truth be told, I began to wish that I had such a close circle of friends to lean on throughout a lifetime."
1,Painful,"I'm shocked to see how many people have given this book 5 stars, it's a travesty. Maybe it's the candy-coated lifestyle she's portrayed that appeals so much, not the book itself. The writing is syrupy and so desperate to paint a perfect chocolate-box picture that not a single detail is left to the reader's imagination. With better editing this book could've been half as long and twice as readable. I'd agree Angry Housewives is very similar to the Ya Ya Sisterhood, but it's difficult to say which is worse."
4,Angry Housewives eating Bon Bons,Don't be put off by the title. It is less fluff than it sounds like. It was a nice read and had some very nice imagery. It dealt well with female interactions and friendship.
2,Way too long for a chick-lit!,"Sometimes, I like fluff and I like light reads. This book fit the criteria, but I can only take fluff for so long. The book is WAY too long. It tries to deal with too many serious issues, but only manages to do it superficially. The points of view change every chapter, which was a bit annoying (a new point of view will be introduced near the end of the book, which felt silly to me). And I had a tough time keeping track of time, despite the year stamped on every chapter - there are jumps that spanned months to years in between chapters and I had a hard time figuring out characters' ages (especially the children). The women are also very stereotypical, especially if you watch ""Sex in the City"" or ""Desperate Housewives."" This type of story has been done before, and unfortunately it has been done better."
2,The world's most perfect children,"Perhaps Lorna Landvik is not a parent so she doesn't realize that no group of children is as perfect as the Freesia Court children. Julia is biracial and adopted and floats thru life until she has a minor setback at 27. Bonnie is brilliant and apparently never talks back to her mother. Merit's girls are beautiful, talented, etc. and seem to suffer no problems due to the relationship of their parents. Even Beau is movie star handsome and finds the ideal mate. One of Audrey's sons does get into a little trouble, but it is not dealt with in this book. The husbands are either wonderful or horrible. There is no middle ground and no working through the ordinary problems that most couples face. These are all two dimensional characters and about as interesting as wallpaper."
2,"If you like Lifetime Movie Channel, this is the book for you!","UGH. My book club chose this as a light reading for the holidays. I tried. I really did. It was just so predictable on so many levels. If they were to make it into a movie, it would be a tv movie starring the likes of Valerie Bertinelli.You got a long flight? Sick in bed for a week? Not up to thinking or being challenged in the slightest by a plot? This book is for you!"
2,Angry Housewives Eating Bomb Bombs,"I am so disappointed. My sister had recommended this book to me.I had expected the wives to be original characters who rang true, but they seemed to be amateurishly drawn, articificial and stereotypical - the earth mother Kari, the beautiful but battered doormat Merit,the saintly gay (gasp!) men, and worst of all the insufferable shrill self-righteous revolutionary prig Slip. I won't put up with political commentary snuck into a novel by Stephen King, a much more skilled writer; I'll be damned if I'll put up with it from Ms. Landvik.If you're a Republican or remotely conservative in your political orientation, prepare to be insulted and sterotyped in print in this novel.I can't understand for the life of me why writers of pop fiction would want to needlessly offend a potential fan; it's just bad business.I feel so cheated :-("
1,Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons,Paper back looks very old and dirty with age. It took 23 days to receive.
4,A little on the long side,"I am a bedtime reader. It took me over 3 months to read AHEB. I found the last 100 or so pages to be the best. I'd say the first few chapters confused me to who everyone was. I agree with the other reviewer about the hospital scene at the beginning, but it did eventually tie in to the story.Having 5 main characters is a bit hard to follow. I did like the book and wanted to finish it."
2,Don't Bother,"The premise was so promising, a group of women form a book club that meets over 4 decades. The characters are so bland, so forgettable, there was no character development, you never cared about them. I was very disappointed. It took me forever to read it. Don't waste your time. Try Cathy Lamb, all three of her books are excellent."
3,"Eating Bon Bons, more like eating sour worms",I thought there were so many characters introduced that it was confusing. I ended up taking notes to keep the families straight in my mind. It was an okay book for a vacation read but not the most interesting book I have read.
1,BEWARE!!!!,"We have used this product for our dogs and bought the spray for the cats too. It stinks and the animals all ended up foaming at the mouth. They constantly vomited due to the urge to clean themselves and looked sick for days. Yes it did kill the fleas, but is it worth your animals suffering to do so? Plus the animals all ended up with raw, red skin due to a reaction. They all sat around foaming at the mouth for days. I found reviews online claiming this product sent many animals to the hospital with the same symptoms ours had. I would stay away from this product because it makes your animals sick. Plus you can't touch them for a few days after the application due to the sticky residue and it's hard to stay away from them when they want attention. Find something else to use that isn't dangerous. We have thrown brand new bottlews out and will never use it again."

It may be good pop or it may be bad pop to those who like pop, I just don't like generic pop. Sorry I can't post music samples."
3,"Good plot, sluggish prose","This is an example of a novel with a solid plot but cursed by a wooden writing style. I'm not sure if this is Cherryh's debut but I had a hard time staying interested because of such mind-numbing prose. I sometimes had no idea what some of the characters were thinking and really didn't care.Still, it's not a bad story. ..."
4,Introduction to the Alliance-Union Series,"I think many of the concepts in Downbelow Station would appeal to my friends who are Star Trek and Star Wars fans. Other reviews have mentioned a lack of action. Throughout reading this book, I never found myself getting bored. I do agree with reviewers on one point, but I am not sure it qualifies as a defect on Cherryh's part. She puts a lot of information into this one novel at a very quick pace. It is disorienting for about the first 2/3 of the book. After I finished this novel, I went out and bought Cyteen."
1,Awful! Just Plain Awful!,"There have only been a few books that I've ever stopped reading. This is one of them. I was excited to start the book. It won a feakin' Hugo Award. It must be good. Right?NOT! The writing is horrible. The story is told in such a confusing manner that I really never made a connection with anyone and those that I ran into more than once, I could care less about. The story starts with an explanation of the universe, which is vague and far too long. Then in Chapter 2 the action starts and NOTHING IS EVER EXPLAINED AGAIN! The action consists of people walking to and from meetings and talking mostly about insignificant items. Please, someone explain to me how this piece of trash won a Hugo? Was everything else that year that bad? This was the era where Heinlein, Clarke, Pohl, Williamson, and Assimov were still actively writing. And this won a Hugo?I stopped after 160 pages and put myself out of my misery and moved on to the latest Varley novel, which was a breath of fresh air."
4,One of her best,"Cherryh has always taunted me with a sensation that she is so close to greatness but can never quite give me believable characters and situations enough to get there. I have not read her entire canon, however. And though I have yet to read Cyteen or Tripoint, I found this book and it's world very engaging. Her greatest success in this novel, for me, is in her contrasting the innocence of the downbelow natives with the selfishness and brutality of humans. Powerful and touching, though a bit unsatisfying in the way Cherryh resolves some of the plot threads (a little too simple and not all believable), this book is one of her best. -sc"
2,Boring,I slogged thru half of this book before shelving it. It was mostly politics and quite boring.
1,"Space station, refugees arrive, nothing else happens.","This is the plot of this book:Space station, refugees arrive, nothing else happens.This is DULL, DULL, DULL. Characters: FLAT. Plot: NONEXISTENT.Stay away. Read the other 1 star reviews if you are still not convinced. I simply do not understand how this book won any award.In the tag suggestions for the review amazon suggests among others: adventure. ADVENTURE??? You will not find it in this book. It is set in a space station where refugees arrive. In the end nothing is resolved. No conclusion to the story, no plot, no character development. ADVENTURE?! LOL."
3,Just read the backcover....,"When you pick this book and read the backcover, consider that you have read the whole novel. The book is straight forward action sci-fi( although there is not a lot of future scientific echnologies are involved) without any originality. A lot of double crossing and triple crossing and intrigues involved and it pretty much does not develop into anything. It feels like the characters are trying to outsmart themselves, and it leaves them pretty unstable in their ideas throughout the whole book. If you prefer the ""Smart"" or ""Philosophical"" science fiction,or if you have just read a lot of science fiction novels overall- skip this book. If you have read other action sci-fi like ""Hyperion"" saga, ""Enders"" series , ""Forever War"", ""Starship Troopers"" and so on and enjoyed them, the chances are that you will Not like The Downbelow Station."
3,Good book,"I think this is a good book on jokes, they are clean and some are useful. I do recommend it as good."
5,Foyle's War series 5 well worth it,This set provides a great conclusion of the series.All the ends are brought together for a satisfactory conclusion and leaves one with the hope that someday there will be a follow-up series with the recently promoted Sgt Milner leading a new series of cases.
4,"Great DVD, Last episode tied up all lose ends",Last in series. Tied up all lose ends. Gives a depth to the history of WW II
5,Foyles war series,"The Foyle's War series (5 seasons) is about the best DVD viewing available. The acting, writing, directing are all excellent. You can view WWII history in England with all the shades of grey. The characters were believable and well rounded. The story lines explored aspects of how lives of all classes of people were affected by the war, ""the good, the bad and the ugly"". I wish I could purchase more of this type of quality drama. Foyle's War is one of the few drama's that I will view again, enjoying and discovering all the fine details. It was sad to see Foyle's war end. I hope this production team will pick another topic to explore. Cannot recommend this series highly enough. The Foyle's War series was enjoyed by ALL members of our family and in our family it is difficult to find a ""one size fits all"" DVD."
5,Foyle's War,"Marvelous acting, storyline, set in a small town England. In each episode the unassuming detective solves murder mysteries and town crises set in the back drop of WWII. The lives of the characters are intertwined with the War, the local police, the government and military. All aspects of life were affected by the war. But daily live goes on and the detective methodically goes about solving the mysteries, backing down to no one in search of the truth. A fantastic British production. Very likeable characters. Wish there were more episodes to buy."
4,great stuff,"The Foyle character, as he is presented, is one of the best in the English detective genre. It's too bad that there are not people, or more people, in the world who are not as straight talking and to the point as Foyle. Interesting as well are the apparently unconnected story lines outside the murder(s) giving the appearance of true life as it goes on in the midst of dramatic events. Watching these episodes is sheer pleasure."
1,"Thank You, Acorn",Loved Foyle's War. Leave it to Acorn to once again take advantage of the fans. Even with Amazon's discount $44 for 3 dvd's is insulting.
1,Does'nt have all the right stuff,"In studying for several tests using this book and my textbook, i found that much of the info in this book was very different from that of my textbook...this book had the wrong info. I have since stopped using it and i am looking for a better substitute."
5,Complete book,"Complete book that gives a good vision of the global GPRS system and that, for once, helps to get in the technical details of the standard."
5,Best Of Classical,I don't know much about classical music and have just started listening to it. I like this CD because it contained a variety of pieces and composers that I was somewhat familiar with. I think this will help me in future choices.
3,Good music,"I got this for the variety, I'm still exploring my interest in classical & thought it would provide a good sample. Product came in new condition & all the music is as it should be. My only complaint is when I added it on to my computer. The discs aren't differentiated so when I add disc one tracks 1-12, it replaces disc 2 tracks 1-12 because the computer reads both discs as the same title and track numbers."
1,1 out of 3 ain't too bad,"I received the package and received 3 cd's with the same music on each cd. Instead of 3 cd's of separate music, the package contained 3 cd's with the same music. I listened and ripped a couple of times to see if I was wrong, but no, they each are the same. I think the package contained cd 1, cd 1, cd 1, instead of cd 1, cd 2, and cd 3. So, although the music on cd 1 is really good, I am greatly disappointed that I did not get the other 2 cd's."
4,Great Christmas Present for a Husker fan!,"This was a gift for a Cornhusker fan who is very passionate about his team! The size of the product was great, and the colors and detail on it was too. It was a fun gift and worth the money. It was packaged very well and arrived safely."
1,No Close Captioning or Subtitles,"Much to our dismay, Inspector Linley 5 does not offer close captioning or subtitles unlike earlier series or Inspector Linley 6. We watched it but missed over half the dialogue. For a recent series like this, I do not understand why the close captioning is missing and why they reinstituted it the following season. Very disappointing when one relies this and all of a sudden it isn't there."
4,"New ""Helen"" nearly ruins this season","Love Lynley, love Havers, and both their specific troubled lives---they are a perfect ""statement"" of how the class system works for everyone---the aristocrat needs their loyal, practical, and grounded-in-reality sidekick. They are a visual statement, and a ""power"" statement as well. Havers has mundane worries and limitations, Lynley has the burden and misery of centuries to carry on his shoulders, has suffered a lot, and we don't begrudge him his rank and income and perfect town-house.BIGGEST mistake is the mis-casting of Helen, who was a perfect foil to Lynley before---but the new actress in the ""non-role"" now looks awful in every respect---that is, trashy by anyone's definition. Having to suffer through her brief scenes and look at her dishelved appearance nearly ruins the episodes. Lynley is gorgeous, lonely, eligible and should be hounded by a bevy of classy titled Debutantes by now---looking at him with this actress beggars belief."
2,Disappointed that there was no closed captioning,"I watched all of the first four episodes. The closed captioning feature of all of these disks was extremely important to my being able to follow the storyline. With the British accents and the fact that I view it while working out on a treadmill, the lack of closed captioning pretty much made this set worthless to me. I could not follow the stories without it. I cannot possibly understand why a company would include closed captioning for part of a series and then discontinue it."
1,Cheated,"I feel cheated. All the earlier sets of this work were close captioned. So I happily bought this. It is not cc, so my money was wasted."
1,Also cheated,"I, too, was cheated. Owning all previous series, I neglected to check for close captioning before purchasing. I am hearing impaired, even with hearing aids, and have difficulty understanding the British accents, relying on captioning to enjoy the DVDs.Continuing to buy the series, though the writers decided they could improve on Elizabeth George's plots, I enjoyed the characters though the plots suffered. Without captioning, this will be the last that I purchase."
3,Snapshot of a point in time,"The film is worth watching for its portrait of a time long gone, but not interesting enough to watch twice. I expected a wittier film than I got, but enjoyed looking at the great costumes worn by Laraine Day. The problem is that the story is perfunctory and jerkily paced. Kirk Douglas is the weakest character. No way do you believe that Kirk Douglas has fallen in love with Loraine Day, or that the swift turnabouts in personality are credible. But Laraine glows and is fun to watch, and the supporting characters are interesting."
2,huh? she married a ghost,"welp what it boils down to is either she married an imaginary friend that no one could see, and if so, how could she just go to this woman's house and walk in that way."
2,A 26 minute Twilight Zone episode,"When I rented this movie, I didn't notice that the run time was only 26 minutes.....no wonder it carried only a $2 rental price! The acting and production values were fine, but the story is, well, another story. Rather than laden this review with spoilers, suffice it to say that if you regularly watched The Twilight Zone, you've seen this plot and plot-twist a dozen times. So between the run time and the trite storyline, even at $2 it is over priced."
1,Made no sense!,Ridiculous movie! It made no sense and was not worth the $1.99 we paid for it! Very odd considering all the awards it supposedly received.
2,"Ummm, not a movie",You cannot call something that is 26 minutes a movie. That is barely sitcom length. They have brass balls charging anyone to watch this.
1,Worse then a B Movie,"Sorry, this was a sad attemp to a a scary movie. I'm surprised they asked $1.99 for it. It should be free or not even offered. Disappointed. Bad writing, bad acting."
3,It was okay,Not bad movie. But they just don't make scary movies like they use to. Simple and easy to buy and stream to my tv. Laptop or iPad through amazon instant video.Story line was interesting and kept my attention to see what happens be next
1,What awards could this have possibly won?!,"This short flick was terrible, awful, boring, lame, nonsensical, bland, tedious, and what the heck are all those tiny awards it apparently won? I couldn't read the small print because I can only see a thumbnail, but I bet one of them is ** tired old person select **"
4,Fascinating Biography,"This is a very interesting history af Nikita Krushchev, who was a flawed leader and yet a person who truly seemed to be trying to make the world a better place. It is in parts laugh-out-loud funny, and at others horrifying. Definitely worth the effort if you are interested in 20th-Century history."
4,Excellent and intriguing,"An excellent book. While at times the author repeats information well known from Premier K's memoirs, the book is chocked full of anecdotes, ranging from the frugalness of Ms. K., to the events surrounding K's son's untimely death.A fascinating look at a guy who had warts yet took the harshest edges off the Soviet system. Must reading for anyone who wants to understand the humanity surrounding the Soviet system."
2,Khrushchev was boring,"I like reading about Sovietology, but please be forewarned: Khrushchev, like US president Eisenhower, was kind of boring. So, while Taubman tries to make the most of his prosaic material, the book frankly could have been made a lot shorter.Hence the two stars."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS ON THE COLD WAR !!!,"Prof.Taubman has enlightened us with his book on one of the greatest dictators of the Cold War.This is undoubtedly going to be the best reference book on the topic.Though Prof.Taubman also shows us that Khrushchev was also a family man ,I conclude that Khrushchev got into the clothes of a sheep but was actually the big bad wolf.This book is full with funny anecdotes and episodes -which brings the reader to see that its author has also the rare gift of an academic,which is:to tell an interesting story as if it were a thriller.Bravo,Mr. Taubman!"
5,A truly great book.,"This is one of the best biographies I have ever read. It is beautifully researched and written. It really is more than just a biography of Kruschev but a history of Russia from the 1920's to the 1960's, as well as of the Cold War. The depiction of Kremlin infighting, as well as the portrait if provides of Stalin, are first-rate. You will not regret reading this book."
4,"Recommended, but prepare yourself for the slow pace","I recommend the book for all the reasons the other reviewers state, but be advised the book is unnecessarily ponderous. If you are a scholar, you might appreciate the lengths the author goes to in attributing so many details to the source materials and the inch by inch pace he sometimes travels at. For the general audience, the book would read better if it were more tightly edited to concentrate on the narrative. The book could probably be slimmed down 100 pages and be the better for it. Having said that, Kruschev is such a compelling character and the system he operated in so bizarre in a fascinating/troubling kind of way that you'll be glad you read this book."
4,"It doesn't ""Bleed"" but I still love it!","If you are a fan of the band like me, than you already know how Angel Dust's evolving sound has changed from Bleed to Human Bondage. Less melodic than its predecessor (Bleed), Enlighten the Darkness gives us an edgier Angel Dust. Songs like ""Cross of Hatred"" and ""Come Into Resistance"" (two of my favorites on the album) have a crunch that separated them from other bands of the genre. However, there are still some beautiful gems on this record as well: ""Beneath the Silence"" and ""Oceans of Tomorrow"" will nearly rip your heart out with their emotional depth and beauty. Not as good as Bleed, but it still sits in my cd collection, and I still listen to it with the same awe and love that I felt when I first took it out of the plastic."
4,"Good stuff, but not the best","If you're familiar with the Lee Perry releases in print already which covered this era, they did a good job of picking out the best stuff from this era. ""The Upsetter Collection"" picked out the best of the killer Upsetter instrumentals, and a lot of the better vocal numbers might be familiar to you already also (""Check Him Out"" from the Upsetter Collection, ""Pound Get A Blow"" and ""No Bread and Butter"" from Shocks of Mighty).Which is not to say there's not some other great material on here. David Isaac's ""Good Father"" and Pat Satchmo's ""Hello Dolly"" are a nice couple of tracks for example. But I think Perry's recording technique was really starting to flourish during the next collection (Volume 2), and I would definitely recommend getting that collection first. Taken on its own merits (without regard to how much of this material the average Perry fan already has), this is a good collection with some nicely groovy instrumentals on it and a few classic tracks."
3,Not-Self Fluxing,"Purchased this item for aluminum radiator repair. The description captioned it as Self- Fluxing,it is not Self- Fluxing. Works fine when using aluminum flux."
2,Could be better,"I found the booklet difficult to use. It may be a good start, but clearer instruction needs to be presented up front. For example, it needs to be plainly stated that pronunciation is as in Spanish. Also, instead of dribbling out the suffixes throughout the book, a simple suffix conjugation table that hit the main suffix uses would be much more helpful. I can use the book, but I'll be looking for better one."
1,Yawn,"Either it was the broken heater in my apartment that always kept it around a cool 98 degrees or the long, detailed, and pointless descriptions in this book that made me fall asleep after two pages of reading. You decide."
2,Quality problem,"I purchased three of these for my night diving lights. They seem to be heavy duty construction. But, there is a lot of inconsistency in the production quality of the brass snap bolts. Two of the three had sharp edges, one of which cut my thumb when I first tried to open the snap. One of the snaps took a lot of working to get it to slide easily. I had to file down the sharp edges to make them safe for use in the water. The manufacturer should have checked these parts before assembly, or at least before shipping to customers, which makes me suspicious about the long term durability of the product, specifically where the phone cord is mounted to the nylon strap (which looks kind of cheezy). As expensive as dive lights are, I'm not sure I'm willing to risk losing one with these lanyards. The lanyards aren't worth the price."
5,Beautifully and intricately made!,"I was astonished by the delicate, perfect details in this figurine. This was definitely worth the price I paid. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Beauty and the Beast figurines."
4,Put everything in one!,"Well, this album has most of the hits from previous albums. Something you can get if you don't want to go through all the trouble to get those albums. There is another album, ""The Collection"", which serve the same purpose (I meant that it is also a compilation). Some of the songs are repeated in these two albums. So, you may ask, which CD is better? Well, it really depends on you. The best hits are available on both albums. The rest is up to you."
4,The movie was best,"I have watched the movie but have not read the book. I rented the video from my local library and it was great! It wasn't my favorite movie, but it was my favorite that was real and had real footage. My favorite part was part 2 because it is about the Apollo program. Part 1 is kind of boring because it talks about the Mecury and Gemini program, witch I don't really like. The parts of the part 2 I like is of the Apollo 1 flash fire, the Apollo 13 part and Deyce's mission in space, Apollo/Soyce. I never knew the whole stoy of the fire untill I watched this video. I didn't know even how Deyce (spelling) looked before I watched this.The sad ending confused me, Deyce died! ( Deyce stands for Donald Slaton's nick name. Deyce co-athored the book and movie) END"
4,Moon Shot,Great documentry on the race to the moon. Covers the early days of NASA and the space program
5,DVD,"This has to made into a DVD, my video is getting old and worn out. I loved the book and the video was excellent."
5,Mythical Indians Who Never Were.,"""The Invented Indian"" is a brilliant dissection of the myths that have been so widely circulated by Indians and their apologists. Trading on their supposed past victimization, Indians--like other minorities--have used the power of guilt and smear to gain socio/political and economic spoils from brow-beaten whites. Veteran anthropologist James Clifton is to be congratulated for bravely stepping aside the unwritten rules on how to talk about minorities in general, and Indians in particular by exposing these myths."
1,Poorly researched and full of inaccuracies.,"As an academic specializing in Latin American business, I have frequent contact with senior managers, politicians, and other academics in Mexico and throughout Latin America. As such, the inaccuracies in this book are plainly evident, and there are many. For a contemporary understanding of Mexico, I would instead recommend Bordering on Chaos by Andres Oppenheimer. An excellent introduction to Mexico's Colonial and Revolutionary history can be found in Blood Drenched Altars by Francis C. Kelley. But stay away from this one."
2,sold as new but clearly used,"i bought this watch for my fiance as Christmas gift,it was sold as new ut yet the watch was dirty, there was a dead battery, and there was a diamond missing in the front, i did not even have to sign for the package, it was just dropped in front of the apartment, where as i had to sign for a $25 package, this watch was 165 and too expensive to not have to sign for and have all these defects."
4,Almost 5 stars!,"Great album with special guests witch make it even better! Songs are long and full of great guitars,Vocals are good, bass and drums are also well played! If there are any flaws it would be the vocals witch with Michael Kikske and Bruce Dickinson sitting in on two seperate songs, he can only get better if anything from them robs of on him! I love the long songs that are really well done and keep your attention, unlike some long songs should've been short songs if you get my drift! Definitaly a band to watch in years to come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not bad,"This is probably what an Iron Maiden would sound like if it was made in 2005. If you're a fan of Bruce Dickinson and Renato Tribuzy, you'd prolly like it more than I did. Still, it's head and shoulders above all that Cannibal Corpse-like crap that's out there.I don't why some people call it a Brazilian band, though. If you look at all the guest musicians, they're not from Brazil."
4,"Improbable, but good","Out of books, walking through Wal-Mart, decided to give it a shot. From the first page on it was a non-stop, delightful surprise. Fawer does a fantastic job of combining a gripping, multi-faceted story line with quantum theory, insightful scientific history, detailed medical data, and a thrilling spy-vs-spy theme. Shades of Crichton, mixed with Clancy, sprinkled with Robin Cook. A fun, interesting read."
1,Visual intigestion,"There are those who falsely think that Tarsis is quite the intellectual. It is sad that a man has artisticly talented as Tarsis has turned out a sick a tome as `City Of Dreams'. Few people if any in real life appreciate the brutally, Tarsis advocates men and women really want.The artwork and story say that to return to innocence, we must be beaten into submission and be dominated. To many pyschological studies and real life captivativity stories prove this to be wrong. What City of Dreams is sugar coated sickness, that harms, not helps healthy relationships and should be relegated to the status of nightmares, never dreams."
3,"decent laugh, but nothing new, re-caps old episodes at most",This is basically the dialogue from different episodes of the show with a few pictures added here and there.Ok for a little laugh on a boring night at work.But nothing new.
1,oh good god,my oh my. im just glad i survived it. it was a little shakey there for a bit... but i made it.
1,A variation on toilet humour,Read the sample pages and you'll know right away whether this book is for you.
3,"It does what it's supposed to, I guess.","It *does stop the draft from coming in under the door. However, we were hoping for better construction. It's kind of like a long, skinny bean bag, and the stuffing inside has the tendency to bunch up at one end or the other. It just requires a little more attention than I would like."
1,quick wik oozes gel,This quick wik oozes gel after sopping up water. It's not as efficient as the shorter one nor does it dry out as quickly. dee
2,Not satisfied with this racket,The racket makes a horrible noise each time the ball is hit. It has poor control. Head Ti S6 was better than this LM8. I would not recomment it to anyone.
2,Do not buy it.,"This is a low quality racquet.My daughter used this one just for two years, not very often. It bent, not broken.Get a better one from prince."
5,i love it,"it is my second racquet and i could feel the huge difference between both, this one is a lot of comfortable and very accurate"
3,Great value,"This is the only place we could find such a small handle on a full-sized racket. We priced the same racket with different handle size for $ more at sports store. Great value. Daughter loves this racket. For some reason though, we thought it was red ------ it is very dark. Comes with case and vibration absorber."
3,Good strings but grip is not holding up,I loved this racket at first but then the grip started to come undone. I didnt want to stop playing and did not have a backup racket with me so I did a little extra harm to the grip.I taped it back up and that lasted about a month and now it is comming undone again. I am disappointed with the grip but I do really like the rest of the racquet.
2,not bad if you restring it first.,I liked the frame of the racket and the grip isnt bad but the strings werent as tight as I liked. I had it re-strung and now I am very happy with it. It has improved my game and made it more enjoyable. only 2 stars because I had to re-string it.
3,Not as good as I expected,"Weight is a little heavy for my style, however its weight can be helpful if you need more power on your serve. Its string lose tension pretty quick, kind of disappointed."
5,Shot Maker,"Excellent balance and feel. Most comfortable racquet I've ever had. I'm a senior power is not my priority, but this racquet works well in that category, too."
3,could be better,I liked the backpack and how it looked. I read a revieve and they said they couldn't get there sleeping bag in the bag compartment at the bottom and I thought they must just have a much bigger bag that not all that suitable for back packing. Found out they were right. I did Find a way i'm kinda suborn i was bound to get in in there. I went through the top unzipped the bottom and pushed like heck to get it down there. I got it done but cant zip the bottom back up. The sleeping bag now goes in the main compartment and use the bottom for clothes and what not....other then that .......good bag
4,Good pack for the light hiker,"I purchased this pack for a camping trip to Fire Island, NY where cars are forbidden and all our gear had to be hauled from ferry to dock to campsite. This pack fit the bill. Very roomy, pockets in all the right places and the adjustable support bars made it very comfortable where I felt like I was carrying a pack of feathers. I also used this for a car camping trip to the Adirondacks and again it worked great. However if you are a hard core backpacker/hiker you probably won't be looking at packs online nor looking at packs at this price point. It seems to be constructed good, not as well as the higher quality packs that sell for 3 times the price, but good enough if you need an occasional pack for shorter trips."
5,Nalgene bottle WILL fit!,"One of the few things that was making me second guess the purchase of this pack is that quite a few reviewers said a full-sized (32 oz) Nalgene bottle would not fit in the side pocket. One reviewer said it would fit but it's snug - he is correct. In the spirit of ""pics or it didn't happen"" I've included a photo in the product images section.This is a great pack at a great price."
4,Great Bang for your Buck,"This is a very good pack for the money. It appears quite sturdy and I had no issues with durability on its one trip out so far (about 8 hour hike with 25 lb). It's quite adjustable, but I had some problems with the angle at which the straps meet my shoulders, and that wasn't adjustable. All the external pouches could be a bit bigger, and only the lightest of summer-weight sleeping bags is going to fit in the ""Sleeping Bag Compartment."" If you want a pack that fits you like a glove that you can leave to your children... keep looking. If you want an occasional use camping pack or a economical spare pack, this is a good one."
4,the cheap little pack that could,"It is a wonderful bag for the price. May not be the nicest thing to look at, but all of the outside pockets are GREAT. Super handy. Love the bottom compartment for your sleeping bag and the rain guard. Have used and appreciated every feature."
5,Great Backpack !,"Purchased this backpack to use as my emergency pack. Holds everything I need for 3 day supply with room to spare. Very sturdy and is holding the 45-50 lbs of stuff in it very well. Very comfortable even with that amount of weight. Great pack for the price. If you're thinking about purchasing one, jump on it!"
4,review,"I thought the pack was great, once you had it on and sinched down correctly you could hardly even notice it was there. There could be more outside pockets for little things but overall we were very pleased with the pack, and would purchase it again."
4,"Buen bulto, tener cuidado con las uniones de plastico","Hice un viaje de 9 dias a peru con este bulto, se comporto de maravilla. Tiene muy buen soporte de cintura, lo que permite distribuir el peso y no recargarlo en los hombros. El material es bastante bueno y la proteccion contra la lluvia es muy funcional, la probe en dos ocaciones y es 100% impermeable aunque un poco delgada.El unico problema que detecte con el bulto es el plastico del que estan hechos las unicones de las correas. En el viaje de regreso de peru, traia el bulto a toda su capacidad, podia pesar casi unas 40lbs, y con el maltrato que le dieron en el aeropuerto y toda la presion, una de las uniones se quebro en dos.Al llegar la arregle con pegamento y no he vuelto a tener problemas. El consejo seria no apretar tanto el bulto si se lleva a su maxima capacidad y va a recibir muchos golpes.Es muy espacioso, que lo diga yo... 9 dias con toda la ropa, zapatos, sueters, regalos, etc. Por este precio es un excelente bulto."
2,"1st bag, and may need a new one now that I know what I'm looking for...","okay bag. It's my 1st true hiking bag so I really didn't know what to shop for but it seemed a bit uncomfortable at first and when I finally got it situated a strap broke. This made my 13 mile hike in-to, then out-of, Havasupai Falls a little uncomfortable.The straps across the chest didn't stay on very well so I was constantly having to re-attach them until the clip, (that holds them to the shoulder strap) broke. Very frustrating because I have a normal Burton Back pack that I've used before and have had no problems with. I bought this bag because I was staying more that 2 nights. I guess if you want to spend the extra cash, buy the newer model or just make sure you know what your shopping for."
4,Great Price,"I've a hiked a bit with this pack and was impressed with the quality and price. It has survived many rainy wet days, harsh heat, long hikes. I managed to shove all my snorkel gear, water purification, first aid kit, flash lights, camera, beach gear, food. Do the research for the price this pack is awesome."
4,"Good value, durable","Got this pack for short trail side camping trips and because I travel for business (international and domestic dams) to semi-remote areas and needed something I could carry easily and not worry about when I chucked it in the back of a pickup in the rain and mud.Despite the low price, it has held up well so far and seems to be well built. The integral rain fly is a great feature (and it works). Its a definite improvement in terms of carrying it around over a duffel bag or roller bag and is very comfortable loaded. I can pack a weeks worth of field clothes in the pack pretty easily.I haven't hiked more than a mile wearing the pack yet or camped out of it, but there's a suitable amount of extra pockets and space so I don't anticipate having problems being able to fit enough kit and clothes and tent for weekend trailside trips."
4,Highly Recommend this Pack,I bought it for my hike down the Grand Canyon & it served its purpose. I'm 5' so I thought it was going to be too tall but it was very comfortable. The sleeping bag compartment is a bit on the small size but I managed to squeeze my bag in there anyways.
4,Good backpack for the money,"i bought this product to go backpacking. i haven't been able to fully go out and test it yet, but it's definitely a pack that would be very difficult to pack enough to last more than a long weekend (unless you plan on only eating what you can find in the wilderness and therefore don't plan on packing much or any food). i have practice-packed it, and i can make it work, but i don't think i'd trust it to go out in the wilderness for more than 3-4 days, tops. overall, i am pleased with it since i'm not a big person and couldn't carry just a whole lot of weight anyway, but others might plan on packing more. i will update this after taking it out for a few days."
2,Just too small,This is a pretty good backpack but it's just too small.The fit is pretty good and was comfortable after getting it adjusted for my height but I don't know that someone over 6-foot could find enough adjustment.Sleeping bag would not fit in the bottom compartment no matter how forcefully I tried to pack it in bit by bit.The top compartment is convenient but the small opening to the rather small main compartment made it difficult to load and unload. Overall it doesn't hold very much gear. Glad the hike was only 2 miles in for a single overnight.
2,Get What You Pay For,"I bought this for a multi day hike through Zion National Park and was not happy with the purchase at all. While the pack has a lot of space, the material is very stiff and hard to maneuver. Nothing clips or zips as easy as it should. I also did not find the straps to be comfortable no matter what adjustments I did to them.Before the next hiking season I will be going up in price to get a better quality pack I can count on. My gamble on going for this cheap one did not pay off."
4,GREAT travelling backpack!,"I recommend this backpack to anybody wanting to travel. I probably packed 35 lbs into it and carried it around my back as I traveled and I really didn't feel it to be too heavy. Great quality, great features, overall a great backpack. Only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because the straps, which are crucial to making the bag feel comfortable, loosen somewhat easily, so I had to adjust every half an hour or so, but that's not too bad."
5,Gran bolso,"Es un exelente bolso si solo tienes que que pasar una o dos noches acampando, su construccion es fuerte y duradera y se puede caminar durante tiempos prolongados con el a cuestas ya que se siente bien en la espalda.Exelente producto."
4,"pleased, overall","the bag is more sporty and attractive than it looks in the pic - i was pleasantly surprised. it was definitely smaller than i expected, and i would not count on it for anything longer than a 2-3 night stay. lots of lovely compartments and pockets to store and organize things, too!"
4,Very nice price and very good quality,"This bag is really cheap and actually very good to travel with. You have space in it, many pockets, I LOVE the rain-bag to protect everything against the water. It's a very good deal"
5,"Our second TETON bag, and just as great","I bought this one for my wife after getting a slightly larger one (Teton Sports 5200 Internal Frame Backpack) for myself. This one seems to fit everything she needs, plus some. I was surprised at the amount since it only holds 55 liters instead of 85 liters of 5200 series one. Both my wife and I love this backpack (as I use it when she doesn't go and it is a shorter backpacking trip where I don't need my 85 liter bag).The quality is great, the straps can be adjusted to perfectly fit your body frame and size. We attach aCamelBak 100-Ounce UnBottlehydration pack to it, making it perfect for any length backpacking trip."
4,Very good with minor caveats,"Took this on a 3 day trip down Skyline to the Sea from Big Basin, CA.This is a smaller pack, but that's not really a complaint since it is clear when purchasing what size you are getting, just something to consider.If you are planning long trips, you will be strapping a fair amount of gear to the outside of the thing.My only real complaint is the side and sleeping bag pockets are a little on the small side. The main compartment is fine for me.With my bearvault (BV500) strapped to the outside I had plenty of room inside for gear and i pack on the heavy side.Total pack weight before adding water for this trip was ~45 lbs, I didn't have any trouble with the pack.The pack is very comfortable, nicely adjustable and durable.It's a little on the heavy side for it's size, so if you are looking for something for ultralighting, this is definitely not it.Overall a very good bag, especially for the price."
4,Nice for the money!,"I bought this for a canoeing/camping trip and it worked out great, plenty of storage, lots of places to atach other items, nice adjustable shoulder straps etc. I was just as pleased with this as my friend was with his 200.00 back-pack that was the same size. Not sure how it will stand the test of time but if it lasts me 3-4 summers im still coming out ahead."
4,Our First Backpack,"My wife and I purchased this pack primarily as a travel pack. So that is how we will review it. I worked great on our recent trip to Denver. We were able to pack clothes for a 5 day weekend with room to spear. It works great as a carry-on back. There are more than enough room and pockets for your stuff. We are very please with our purchase of this backpack as a travel pack. Maybe on day we will see how it performs as a hiking pack. We recommend with pack for the price, it is a great value. My wife has the orange and I have the green. Both are good choices."
4,not as promessed,"the bag is perfect, well made and finished, but the product description never mentioned that the bladder wasn't included. next time, don't put photos of a feature that the bag does not include."
3,came with broken latch,"Looks ok, but to many ties and latches could be simpler. also the latch that is to hold the optional camelback hose was broken when received."
2,Not matched with the product picture!,"I received the backpack today and was surprised that it is green in color. The outlook is really part of my concern. And if it is green but not brown/grey in color, I would have bought another cheaper one. Teton Sports should do something!"
3,broken waist buckle on first hike,"My buckle broke on the first hike I took it on. Granted, I was in the Adarondaks and it was freezing temps. The pack was only about 50 lbs. and the top prong of my buckle broke. However, even with one prong it still hung on pretty well and made it through the hike."
4,Europe trip,Bought this for a trip to Europe .one of he toggles broke before we even left. Other than that it held up for he trip.
2,Starter bag,"We bought this bag as my husband's first bag. Then after he got a better bag, it became mine. It is NOT comfortable. the lack of comparments is a serious problem. You can only access the items in the bag through the top. The sleeping bag compartment is a little tight too and I had to fight it to get my sleeping bag in there.Thankfully this bag has now been retired and we both have new bags."
4,Its a deal,"This is by far the cheapest backpack for sale that I have found and it works well relatively speaking. It is not a replacement for a 200$ nice functional backpack but it is great for beginners and it gets the job done for small trips. I love the separate sleeping back compartment as well as the outside tie straps. My biggest complain were that some of the seams seemed a bit torn when I used it for the first time but nothing too terrible. My second complaint is this backpack is not meant for people taller than 5'10. The hip strap cannot be adjusted well enough to balance the weight. But as I said earlier for someone who is just getting started and might not even take up backpacking as a passion, 50 bucks for a pack is a steal."
3,good quality,"Backpack was of good quality. I could not get my sleeping bag into the compartment, but held up good in the rain and I was very satisfied with the number of compartments on the pack."
4,Very Good Bag for the Money,"I got the scout 3400 back at the beginning of 2011, the yellow version. I have used it on a couple hikes and a camping trip since then. The bag has a lot of little pockets and features for stowing gear allowing me to attach two sleeping pads to the outside. The zippers could be a bit smoother but they seem well constructed. As far as the sleeping bag compartment goes, yes it is a bit on the small side. But I was able to fit a Eureka Casper 15 degree bag into it after fully compressing it and then had to angle it around to get it through the opening and after putting a knee on it was able to close the zipper. A tight fit to be sure but it fit so I'm not sure why some have said they couldn't get their 35F bags into this compartment. You definitely have to use a sleeping bag designed for backpacking if you want it to fit. Which means it should be a mummy either using goose down or modern polyester fibers like hollow fiber, r-teq, duraloft, climashield or polarguard."
4,right pack,"This pack was for my 11 yr. Old, who is in scouts. The adjustable frame worked for him and has room for him to grow in. The pack was scheduled to come in 5 days, was here in 2!"
5,Amazing purchase,"We were so excited to find this product on Amazon for such an incredible price. We had been looking for several weeks for a backpack for my son's trip to France, to study abroad. We considered using one we already had and buying a seperate rain fly but the rain fly cost almost as much as this new backpack, that comes with an attached rain fly! My son loves this backpack and has been using it in Europe for two weeks now. Plenty of room, lots of pockets and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Love it!,We took it out for a test hike just the other day. Worked great! My only complaint is that the pack isn't big enough! With one sleeping back and some basic supplies the pack was stuffed to the gills. The quality is outstanding - everything was well made and the fabric and pouches where well thought out. Highly recommended for short backpacking trips. I think the Teton 4000 is my next purchase to go with this one...
3,More to Follow,"The pack showed up real fast. Only after 2 days. Everything seems durable although I'm not sure I trust that the shoulder straps are secured by a single piece of hook and loop (Velcro). I got it for my wife because it is designed only for someone up to I think it said 5' 9"". We are taking it on an extended camping trip in about 2 months and I will write a full review on how it fielded afterwards."
3,Orange doesn't rhyme with anything,"Plenty of room in this pack to bring way too much stuff that you may or may not end up using. The straps works well to secure your load. The bottom pocket is big enough to stuff mummy bag and not much else. I found it fairly easy to use this pack. It did not fail me in wind, frost, fog, rain, and plenty of sunlight. I did use the rain cover that is conveniently tucked at the bottom of the bag. I think the side pockets could be improved upon in design but overall for the price I couldn't beat the Mecca with a stick.Follow the path, one foot in front of the other, enjoy the journey as well as the destination, pack light and your back will be thankful."
3,Backpack,"It is heavier than it looks. Also, when stuffed it elongates rather than widens which causes more of a balance issue."
4,Good for the price,HiI have been in hiking and mountaineering field for long time. I did lots of high altitude Himalayan treks (over 17000 ft).This backpack is really good for all the hiking needs.I liked it. I have seen reviews that it is bit heavy however I feel its ok.It is strong and good looking when fully packed.I would recommend it.RegardsYogesh
5,great entry level,"I bought this for my wife who had not done much back packing before, and it worked out great. Very light and comfortable. It doesn't have a huge internal capacity, but it was perfect for a 4 days trip. Good pack fo the price."
3,"Nice pack, but for smaller people. Guys, read the product description.","This pack seemed a good choice after I read all the customer reviews and ratings when compared to other packs. The price seemed a good deal too. The only complaint I have is that this thing was way too small. Note to anyone checking out packs. Really review the product description and measurements. I did not. I'm 6'1"". I didn't notice that this pack was built for a smaller person until I recieved the bag and read the attached tag that said, ""Maximum height, 5'9""."" I'm six inches too tall for this thing. I'd have been ok with that and kept the bag anyway, but the sleeping bag compartment was a joke of a size. It was obviously made for a smaller person. My mistake.The quality of the bag itself is great. It seemed sturdy, and despite it's size could comfortably hold a large amount of weight."
3,Sturdy enough for air travel,"Well, enough said about it being comfortable to carry, and that it has a nifty bottom opening to squeeze that extra set of clothes or stuff.I've sent it through the checked in luggage when traveling on airplanes and it survived, though you might not want to put anything important in the top zip-compartment cos once i found it was open[even though it was not damaged. luckily nothing was lost, but i wun try that again]Pretty sturdy and is a good bag for compressing your stuff with all the useful straps."
5,Great backpack,"I bought this backpack last minute for a weekend in the columbia gorge area, It worked great. The backpack doesn't strain my back at all, the load felt very even. And the attached rainfly came in handy once as well. It comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras (tent rods, sleeping pad, rope, etc...) I am thoroughly impressed to have found a good pack for such a bargain price"
4,a decent pack,I will probably revise this one way or the other after my trip but So far I think the pack will be ok. Part of me wishes I had gone with a bigger pack but all that will do is allow me to take things that I dont need. this pack will prevent me from doing that and Im sure my back will thank me later. The zippers seem to be of quality material. However I think the clip on the chest strap is a bit flimsy but we will see how it holds up on a trip to the Pharaoah lake wilderness.
4,"So Far, So good","Bought these for my two Webelos Scouts for their advancement into Boy Scouts. My son has used his and it works really well. It has plenty of room and has a number of places to hook carabiners on to carry items on the outside of the pack. There are straps for carrying both a bed roll and a sleeping bag. My son is just shy of 5' tall, the other Scout is about 4.5', this bag will work for a while for the both of them since it will adjust to their heights over the next couple of years."
5,Great Pack for the Money,"For the price you can not do better. Took last weekend on a mountain hike 7 miles up the mountain and 7 down. The pack did great. If you plan on hiking the AT you may want to spend more money, but for the weekend hiker this pack works good."
4,nice backpack,"this is a nice pack, the only problem is the sleeping bag compartment is a little small. but its still a nice backpack.very rugged and well made."
4,Just right,"I bought this for my son when he began Boy Scouts. He was almost 5 feet tall. It seems to be just the right size for him. Any bigger and he couldn't carry it. I like all the extra pockets for smaller items, and the attached rain cover. I agree the sleeping bag compartment is too little, but I just switched his sleeping bag to the main compartment. Eventually he will outgrow this, and his little brother will inherit a great backpack, but it has been a fantastic pack for a beginner. He has had a lot of compliments from other scout parents, and we have yet to have any problems."
5,great deal,"i just bought this and love it. adequate room for equipment, comfortable, and well made. the side pockets could be a little bigger (my water bottle is a snug fit). The extra compartment for the sleeping bag is great (but you got to have a compact bag). also great for wet weather. and the price is the best part. i wish this had been my first pack."
4,Better than expected,"The Scout 3400 proved to be beter than I expected. When you spent so little you can only expect so much but in this case the pack delivered so much more! The size is perfect for a two or three day hike. The sleeping bag storage area turned out to be too small for my mummy bag, but aren't they all? The materials appear to be sturdy and the features many. I like the adjustability of length and the ample storage options. I would (and have ) recomend this pack as a short trip alternative for short cash."
2,Cheap quality,"Avoid this backpack. I used it for a month in Australia and it fell apart in multiple ways. Snaps broke off. Zippers broke off. The various clips are low-grade plastic and break easy. I took care and didn't even travel that hard during this trip. On prior trips, I borrowed by friend's Dakine bag to 2 separate month-long trips through Thailand, Cambodia and Peru. It worked flawlessly. No damage, and no problems. I expected the same with this bag, but I was sorely mistaken. It may be affordable, but not worth it if all the various pieces end up breaking while you're using it!"
5,Great Buy!,"Used this bag on my Grand Canyon Trip. Loved it! Could fit everything I needed in this one bag! It was a little big for me as I'm only 4'11"" But all in all it was good. Well made and the price was good."
5,Best pack for price!,"The best pack for this price range and size. The length is easily adjustable (that was the only part I was worried about, as this is a one-size-fits-all sell, but the shoulder-to-hip length can be adjusted) and there are all the zippers, pouches, attachment points that you would expect out of a quality pack, durable design, looking forward to first use! Unless you use this kind of pack... like, every weekend... I don't think a more expensive model would ever be necessary."
2,durability in question,"I have used these Playtex gloves everyday for 12+ years. I have observed this past year that they don't last as long in spite of the ""flexstrong formula"" claim on the packaging. After a few months of use, the fingers stretch and eventually one of the fingers will rupture on its own. They are designed for more waste. I will be looking for something stronger and more durable for everyday use."
5,Good Gloves,"I purchased these for my mother, who is allergic to dish soaps. The ones in the stores aren't as thick as these, according to her. She likes them just fine."
3,Thought they would be thicker..,I needed a pair of durable gloves to protect my nails when I did housework and cleaned the dishes. Gloves I had in the past always broke at the tip of the fingers because my nails were growing out. So I was looking for something that had durability. I saw the great reviews and decided to purchase. Arrived on time but I thought they would be thicker. They also run a little small because I got the medium (size I am in most gloves) and its a little snug. Had the pair for over a week now. Seems to hold up but only time will tell. Can't go wrong with the price..Update***Glove broke after about a month..not really durable. Since have bought a store generic brand (I think Stop and Shop) which is thicker and holds up a lot better.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD because it was supposedly full of good instruction on coaching and spotting gymnastics. I was expecting to be shown the correct way to do the exercises, and the correct way to spot for it. The Preschool workout only shows segments of the class, and is more like an advertisement for the class than instruction. The other two DVDs show instruction as if you have been in gymnastics for quite some time. I was looking for something like, how to do a handstand, cartwheel, backbend and walking on the balance beam correctly and how to spot the exercise correctly as well. I learned almost nothing from this DVD and feel that it was very misleading."
1,"don't buy this, it's low budget junk","I made the mistake of buying ""The Rolling Stones: Rolling On"" when I happened upon it in a video store some years ago. I urge you not to make the same mistake. It's low budget trash I'm sure the band would not condone having on the market. It's just as well Amazon.com has it out of stock. Don't knock yourselves out bringing it back."
2,Jardin de Bagatelle Not a Flower Garden,"I had high hopes for this perfume, from the description. I was looking for a floral fragrance, with a strong gardenia overtone. Although the fragrance is OK, it has no lasting power at all. I can dab this on my wrists and within 30 minutes, I cannot detect any aroma at all. One of the tell-tale signs that the aroma disappears is that no one at work has commented --- good or bad --- about this perfume; it simply does not make the trip from home to work. Also, one of the bottles had a damaged stopper. I am just wondering if this perfume was diluted in any way. Regardless, I will not purchase this product again. I am still looking for that special fragrance!"
4,"Maybe there wasnt a war, but something was brewing","Without giving away the story, the synopsis is as follows: Yoni was born in 1958; and a few years later he was joined by his two younger brothers, making a family of 5. His middle class family grew, as did the State of Israel. They celebrated the holidays, and in 1967, they were caught up in the euphoria of the State's 6-day war victories. So much so that in Purim 1968, Yoni and his brothers dressed up as the recently captured Wailing Wall and a fleeing Palestinian. It is at this Purim party that the movie opens and jumps ahead 4 years to Pesach 1972, after Yoni is expelled from school for failing all his courses. The film follows Yoni and his family over the next 2 weeks as Yoni seeks refuge from his family, his American born mother, and in particular, his bullying (or is he?) father, while he tries to overturn his father's decision to banish Yoni to an all-male, 'military-focused' boarding school in Rishon. Music by Aviv Geffen."
4,Some Enchanted Season,I like this author and this book is true to her style of writing. Just a feel good Holiday book that I recommend if you can't quiet get enough warm feeling through the holidays.
5,A very enchanting read...,"This was my first Marilyn Pappano book...I stayed up until 4 am reading it, it was that GOOD. I am particular about my books, and this one had great character development and realistic situations. I have passed it around to all of my friends. I have made it a point to read all of Pappano's other books. A great read!"
4,Great addition to the Little Mermaid video!,"What a great addition to our bookshelf! My 3 year old daughter loves the Little Mermaid video, but I try to limit her viewing time. This book is a top choice to fill in on those days we skip the videos.This book includes all the major story elements and characters, a feature that is unavailable in the shorter versions I've seen. It also uses direct quotes from the video, which my daughter loves. The beautiful images from the movie are on each page, with short paragraphs, which keeps her engaged, and doesn't take nearly as long to read as you might think.I only gave 4 stars because I think that with the vast amount of material included, this book is just a little dry. I'm not sure how engaging it would be as a stand-alone read, versus as an accessory to the movie.For our purposes, though, this a great book, and we read it frequently. Money well spent!"
4,valentina,I really liked this book because it has perfect vocabulary for kids.Even though thre is a movie many kids like to read the books of movies the have made.This disney production can help children understand their vocabulary.Many kids even if they see the movie and read the book they get the main idea also.
1,Would be great if I ever received it...,"This was horrible service. I ordered 2 items from this specific vendor and only received one of them, after waiting almost 3 weeks. The vendor did refund the money, but they said they would send me the item for free which I'm still waiting for."
2,Something Is Missing!,"This workbook has the best format of any workbook I've seen. It drives on practice...practice...practice. This would easily be a 5-Star workbook and maybe the absolute best if the answers to the questions were somewhere in the book. As a workbook for beginners, I believe the answers should exist so a self learner could check his/her work so they don't develop bad habits from the start. 2 Stars might seem harsh, but for the price of this workbook I expected something complete."
2,i thought it will be a hard cover and nothing wrote on.. But there was many pencil marks,"i thought it will be a hard cover and nothing wrote on. But there was many pencil marks...Next time, please have everything in hard cover! thanks"
2,Great for a small child,I bought this for myself and didn't realize how small it was. I had to gift it to my little sister instead. Its super small and thin material.
1,Mostly Long and boring,Merryll of the Stones is too long and dragged out. The bits in Welsh dont help either. Boring!
4,"great book, but short","interesting and informative, but a little short for the money. If you read ""zen in the art of archery"" by eugene herrigel and didn't hear enough about awa kenzo, this book will give you what you want: it presents a limited biography and then gives some of his ( most important?) sayings and a few pictures of him with his bow. It got 4 out of 5 stars because it cost 12.95 list price plus shipping and is 101 pages long. Still a great read if you are interested in zen archery."
2,just ok,"I've got a thing I guess for Britcoms dealing with the clergy (BritishClergyComs?). Just the title 'Father Ted' makes me laugh, I loved 'The Vicar of Dibley', 'Bless Me Father' was pretty good but I found ""Oh Brother!' flat. I didn't find the star, Derek Nimmo, or his character enchanting which is ok if the supporting characters are well drawn but they weren't- at least for my taste. I'd recommend this DVD set for other BritishClergyCom fanatics only."
5,LOST GEM FROM THE GOLDEN AGE OF JAZZ,"During his heyday, Jabbo was considered one of the best players in jazz. Due to the brevity of his career (because of substance problems), Jaboo spent many years living in obscurity working for a car rental agency in Wisconsin.Being from Charleston, SC, where Jabbo spent his formative years at the Jenkins Orphanage learning to play for the Orphanage band.One listen to these tracks ... and anyone will be converted. These songs are of equal quality than Louis Armstong's Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings."
1,WARNING - Does NOT do hotsync!,"This cable is a charging cable only. It has no hot-sync button. It is also not a Palm cable, although I was able to get it plugged in after a little work. So if you ONLY need a charger, this will work. If you need a new hotsync cable, search for one that has an actual hotsync button."
2,disapointing,"This item appears to have been sitting on the shelf for an extended period of time. The ""lotion"" had deteriorated into a ""liquid"" by the time we received it."
4,On Time and Very Satisfied !,My product was shipped within the time period stated and it arrived wrapped and in brand new condition. I was very satisfied and will purchase again ! Thanks !
4,"GREAT read, especially for those that don't like history","This is an GREAT read, especially for those that don't like history. It has alot of fun information in an easy to read style. My children think it is even better than ""Oh, Yuck: . . ."" by the same author."
4,Awesome! Very Funny!,"I am a history teacher. A student brought this book in to share with my. I laughed my self hoarse on some of the quick parts I read. I just had to get it so that I could finish it at my leisure and share it with my history teaching hubby! It is full of historical material and science facts, in addition to other things."
4,Ahh Boys,I bought this as a Christmas present along w/ two other books having to do w/ gross stuff in hopes to get my boys to read. I am still waiting on a third book that I ordered last month. I'm sure the boys will enjoy it...especially if they can gross their sister out!
5,Awesome!!,"We thought nothing could top ""Oh Yuck!"", but my son cannot keep his nose out of this book!! It is fascinating, educational and most of all...fun and hilarious. What better way to learn??"
2,"Fun, but...","It looks like a fun enough book. One that I got for my kids and really wanted to like. But, when I was just looking at the section on electricity I found out that Westinghouse was the inventor of AC current. Really? I guess because he's rivals with Edison and promotes AC, he's suddenly also the inventor of AC current, too. You have to wonder why a book with a subtitle of History's Grossest, Wackiest Moments can't even mention the wacky and wonderful Nikola Tesla? Hmmm....I get a bit suspicious of books who fail to give credit where credit is due, or try to dumb down information to such an extent that it doesn't become information at all, but something more like misinformation. It's even worse if I have to wonder if the misinformation is intentional."
5,Hard to put down,I never thought gross thing would be so interesting. My seven year old just loves it. I have to admit I have picked it up quite as often as he. There is so much to learn. I hope another one comes out.
3,Indys enemy is more deadly than bullets or disease....thirst,Indy is on the move in order to retieve water. He must fight against the germans to obtain it. He is reuntited with his old friend T.E. Lawrence in the war against germany. He also befriends a partner in the secret service who holds a dark secret. Will Indy die by a bullet or die of thirst first in this action packed adventure?
3,these movies are OK,"The young indiana jones movies are good but not as good as the originals with Harison Ford. thing that I like is the fact that they put a fake scar on the actor's chin because Harison Ford has a scar on his chin. This way it works with the flash back in Indiana ""Jones and The Last Crusade"" when young Indy wips himself in the chin. He also got his hat in this flash back. ""Daredevils of the Desert"" is a good one to get if you want one that is similar to the originals. If you want one that is compleatly different than get ""Trenches of Hell."""
1,Warning: NOT for children,"Although this movie has no rating, (and why is that?) I would say it is the equivalent of a PG-13. The film contains quite a bit of violence and violent themes. War scenes. Guns firing. Man falling off cliff including hitting the ground. And the scene that made me turn it off showed a close up of Young Indiana stabbing a man including close-up of knife going in and out of his stomach. Parents beware. ""Not rated"" does NOT mean it didn't deserve one!"
1,bad,they are insulting other nations in this film. As a turkish youth I felt myself very bad. This is a political film it only aims to insult other nations.. Americans and British people are hero in this film of course.. According to them other nations are natural disasters.. Too bad for human beings..
4,soso.,nice case. that's all.but i think univasial wait deck is better.i'm not used this card. i'm falling in love tarot card!
4,The original Rider Waite Tarot Pack,The Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack arrived in very condition - only one criticism - the colours of the Waite pack are now inferior to what they used to be - which is no fault on your side! Just the obvious economy of good colours by the manufacturers.....
1,Terrible coloring,"The quality of the images in this deck is horrible; dull, grainy colors, dotted red faces, it's just awful! You will do better to buy the better-colored deck by itself (091386613X, $12.24 here at Amazon) and get yourself a good introductory book (I like: 1578630487, but there are many). Go to a local New Age or Occult bookshop, find what you like, write down the ISBN then buy it cheaper at Amazon. When buying cards, make sure you know what the cards look like, not just the outiside of the box!!!"
4,Nice set...,I purchased this as a gift for a friend who was into reading tarot cards. He loved the set and uses it all the time. Definitely recommend it as a set.
3,"Good quality cards, with a few problems","These are great cards, the packaging is great and feels complete. However all these cards are discolored as stated by many other reviews here. There is a green/blue tinge on all cards, which is nothing horrible, and adds to the vintage feel, but still would have preferred the original colouring. Also there is a small printed branding on the face of every card. Very intrusive when dealing with these. Otherwise it's a great pack."
2,Keep looking.,"The artwork on these cards is not as clear as I would have liked. Must be something about the prints, but the lines are so thick in places you can't make out the elements of the scenes and the colors are terribly splotchy. The point of the art is the fine detail and symbolism packed into each piece, and this set loses so much of that."
5,Rider Waite Tarot,"As one of the original tarot decks, it was nice to see what the initial concepts were for many of the newly inspired decks. I have to admit, compared some of the newer-modern decks, you can't beat the original!!gec"
3,"Standard deck, but the book is compressed and not user friendly.",I bought this for my dad and I had to buy him an accompanying book as this one was not very user friendly.
3,its nice i got the deck but the little book sucks,"the little book may as well not even be with it because it isn't very helpful, i could read the stuff in there on wikipedia...so i suggest buying the other rider set that comes with a bigger book or getting a tarot book to go in addition with it if your a beginner.. this is my first tarot set so i don't have much expectation for the deck but the deck is nice."
3,"Classic Deck, Very Poor Card Stock",I love the Rider Waite system. I think the muted colors in this deck are sophisticated and beautiful. I own probably 100 decks of different varieties. None are produced on such cheesy paper. These cards are extremely flimsy and printed on very poor card stock. I was so disappointed. They start to warp and bend while shuffling. This beautiful rendition deserves better.
3,Classic tarot pack,"not a bad product. the cards are all well made and look very original, the packaging is very bright and tidy. unfortunatly the ""instructions"" leave alot to be desired. the explaination of each card is not detailed nor are a variety of spreads presented to you. they are also written on a very small book. if you want a beautiful ( but not original ) tarot deck i would strongly recommend Mystic Dreamer Tarot (Book & Cards) Heidi Darras, Barbara Moore. if u already know how to read the cards and are looking for an original deck thank this is the one for you."
1,Fake Cards,"The cards I received were FAKE CARDS. Amazon should stop dealing with this vendor. The colors are completely off, don't even know if these cards were printed using U.S. Games Systems Permission"
3,Great Cards but worthless book!,"As previous reviewers have stated, the cards are beautifully descriptive, easy to interpret, etc.However I was expecting a normal size book, the size of a paperback. This is the size of the cards and so tightly bound with tiny print that I was shocked! Why would they even bother including it???Not giving up I tried to find information on specific cards and it is impossible without scanning every page. Shame on somebody for killing the trees to make this useless book!"
4,nice beginner set,"I would reccomend this set for a true novice, but if you want to start reading for profit, I would reccomend something with a little more depth, and more complicated pictures."
3,Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack,The cards are wonderful but they had a strong unpleasent ordor and for 5 days I needed to deordorize them before I could rid the smell and use them.
3,Not the best available,"I have had several different versions of the Rider-Waite tarot deck. I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with the ""original"" deck. The colors of the cards are dull, and the cards themselves are large and awkward to handle. The accompanying book is smaller than a man's wallet, with small print. The author tends to rattle on about ""secret doctrines"" and really offers very little information for beginners. I wouldn't recommend this set for anyone serious about learning the Tarot. The other resources available today are much more easy to learn. I'm purchasing the CD-Rom set ""Tarot Magic"", and maybe with both I can refresh my skills as a reader."
1,Very poor quality reproduction,Having used various versions of the RW deck since the early seventies I can honestly say this is the lowest quality edition I have ever seen. The images are very heavily pixelated and the trademark is quite noticeable on the face of each card. For my purposes the defects in printing are so egregious as to render the deck unusable. If you care about image quality I strongly suggest you pass on this edition of the deck.
1,Very bad printing,I was so disappointed from the cards.the colours are blur and with the same yellow toning.I bought many packs but never had such a bad experience.
2,Bad print job,"How disappointing that they would go through so much trouble to put together such an appealing package of book, box, and cards and then do such a bad print job. The colors are not true to the original. Half of the brilliance of this artist's work were her choice of colors."
4,"Good deck, not a lot of explination","Overall I would say this is a good deck. But not for a begginer. It is obviously a classic. But, if you are looking for a detailed explanation of the cards you won't find it here. There is no leading explanations for a begginer, which could be tough if you don't know the cards. So if your starting out, learn on a smaller, simpler deck with some explanation of the cards (just so you have an idea). Then I think this would be a good, classic deck to use."
4,Hermética,"The paintings in each card are not that accurate and clear, but this is from an artistic perspective. And would have liked that the booklet had information about the care of these for a new beginner like me. But thru the days I have started to comprehend more each card and its meaning. They arrived very fast!!"
1,Skip it.,"Granted, they are tarot cards. So they are naturally use-able. But the artwork is horrible, backs and front included. I have this very set and I cannot stand it. Save yourself the time. Get a different set."
4,Great Starter Deck,"This deck is a lot of fun to work with. I combined it with the ""Learning the Tarot: A Tarot Book for Beginners"" and enjoyed learning more about Tarot. While the artwork isn't up to today's standards, I like the fact that it is the original design."
2,Did not conform to my requirements,"This printing of the Rider Waite deck is tarot-able!For the past 18 years or so I have worked as an (eyes open) Tarot Reader and the RW deck has been and still is my favorite deck. In that time I have worn out many decks, and I have replaced them by going to a Hollywood store and getting a new deck. The previous time I needed a new deck I bought this item on-line, and I was very disappointed. The imaging is poor, and the feel of the cards is rather flimsy. I would not use this deck in my work as the crutch, as they are not as flashy as in years past by other suppliers."
3,The Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack,"I'm a begginer tarot reader and I ordered this deck to acompany a book I perchased a few weeks back. I was a little put off by the deck's grainy artwork, but I would still recomend it to any novice as a first deck. It's relativly cheap and the tiny, pocket-sized reference book definately comes in handy. Not the 'end-all-tarot-deck', but a decent consideration for begginers.P.S.- As a result of the Tennessee public school system, my spelling is terrible, so please over look any spelling or gramatical errors. Thanks and happy reading."
2,The Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack,"This is a defective product by the publisher, otherwise it would rec a 5 of 5 stars. The publisher repeated pg 145 twice missing pg 147. Amazon replaced the first order only to receive a second order that was also defective and this is an essential part of the book in interpretating the last four cards.Until the publisher recalls the entire lot and fixes this I would not recommend purchasing the book."
1,Gorgeous but Useless,"This sumptuous, gorgeous printing of the Rider-Waite deck is useless to a true understanding and study of the Tarot: the publisher and/or printer apparently had no respect for the original design--for the POINT behind it. Colors are absolutely critical to a full understanding of the meaning of each card, and every card in this edition is washed in a delicious gold, utterly destroying the influence the colors are expected to have over the subconscious. You will not find a blue (emotion) or a purple (triumph) in the entire deck. Both have been replaced by a washed-out pea green, signifying nothing and altering the meanings of entire suits."
2,Not good for those just starting with Tarot,"This was the frist tarot I got and it's not very good. The book is very SMALL and hard to read. The cards them self are okay but not very colourful and I wasn't happy about the nude cards. If you are just starting to learn Tarot get a better set, the book is hard to follow and your eyes start to hurt from looking at such tiny print. I don't even use it anymore."
2,"Of historical interest, but may not appeal to beginners","This was the first Waite deck I got and it just didn't appeal to me. The main problem is the blues of the original images that they reproduced for this deck have apparently all faded to a dull pale green that is very unappealing. I have since acquired the Universal Waite and find it much more pleasant to use. The Original Rider Waite is of historical interest, but I think will not appeal to many users. The packaging is well done, though Waite's Key to the Tarot booklet is less useful to a beginner than a book such as Rachel Pollack's Seventy Eight Degrees of Wisdom."
4,Great Beginners set of cards,"These were an awesome choice for my first Tarot, the are easily labeled and beautiful. The little book offered lots of isight, especially being written in 1910 by Arthur Waite. A big hard to read, due tot he outdated wording, but beneficial nonetheless."
3,Nice But Crappy Quality,"They are nice cards and then can read well, but if you're looking for something that is of nice quality this is not... the picture quality is NOT that great.. whatever printed this really sticks at printing. Be warned. However this is a great tarot set to start out with since it comes with a nice little book."
1,"""Original"" Rider Waite Deck Warning","The ""original"" Rider Waite deck that I received had an ugly plaid design on the backs of the cards, and the image quality of the pictures was terrible. It was the ugliest deck of cards I've ever seen. I returned them, and got the UNIVERSAL Rider Waite deck instead, and am very happy with it. If you're determined to get a deck labeled ""original"" you might want to try to make sure you're not stuck with the ugly plaid version of this deck."
3,Doesn't have the titles of the cards on the minor arcana cards,"Beautiful pictures, but the minor arcana cards do not have their titles on them. Ie the two of cups in most decks will say ""love"" on the card, this deck doesn't have that, just the picture and a number 2. So if you are very familiar with the tarot this is fine, but if you're more of a beginner you may prefer a deck with these titles on the cards. The major arcana cards do have their titles on the cards."
1,tarot poorly printed,"I have been a reader for over 30 years and am a mentor with the American Tarot Association. I think I know the Rider deck pretty good. The art work is there in this printed in China deck but the colors are way off!!!!!!! What should be blue is green. I feel I have wasted my money as I will never read with this deck and the printing is of such poor quality I won't even use it as a gift or freebie give away. If you want the Rider Waite deck, look for the one from US Games in the yellow box with the Magician on the front. Otherwise go for the Universal Waite US Games also. But stay away from this bad China copy!!!!!!!"
4,"Excellent book for beginners, not very pretty cards","I found this book excellent for me... Now is the book I use to guide me when I forget some significances or I want a second opinion. The cards are not what I expected, the coloring is very dark so you cannot notice some details in the pictures, but nevertheless I use them everyday and I have learned to love my cards."
5,"With IBM's bungling, how could Microsoft fail?","People who complain that this book is unfounded because IBM is growing and profitable forgets that over a decade ago, IBM was a stinker: the bottom had fallen out of the lucrative mainframe market, and IBM could not compete long-term in the rapidly growing PC/Workstation market. This book is a great lesson in how not to adapt to change.Luckily, IBM has pulled itself out, but at what cost? Imagine if IBM had got the PC revolution right? There might not even be a Microsoft today and IBM could have retaken its position as THE corporate super-power.Besides discussing poor management, I enjoyed the information and great anecdotes about IBM's relationship with Bill Gates and Microsoft. I cannot believe the number of opportunities IBM squandered to acquire, invest or eliminate Microsoft. It seems that IBM pratically pushed Gates to build Microsoft into the power it is today."
4,A lively history of the PC era,"Paul Carroll wrote this book as a novell crammed with details and humor. By reading this book we can understand a little bit better how IBM has lost its glamour in the 90's and how Microsoft has became such a powerful company . Moreover, the history acts as a good teacher, showing us why a successful company can go down due to bad management and at the same time, the good decisions that leverages smaller ones in order to achieve global positioning .Marco Aurelio - Brazil"
5,On the edge of your seat excitement with Savage/Flair!,"Wrestlemania 8 is the cream of the crop of the Wrestlemania series. Savage/Flair, Hogan/Sid and Hart/Piper make for a huge three hour extravaganza! Vince McMahon was at the top of his game, but when isn't he?"
2,wrestlmania 8 stinks,This is one of the worst wrestlemanias I have seen. There is only two good matches. Flair and Macho man and Piper vs Hart is the only good matches on this tape. The Hogan and Sid match was very dispointing. So I would rent this event but don't buy it.
3,It's too bad this was Ric Flair's only Wrestlemania,"This actually isn't a bad PPV to own. The WWF title match between Randy Savage and Ric Flair is great, though kind of unbalanced. Unfortunately, Hulk Hogan's ego cheapened that match with that ""double main-event"" crap. He apparently made sure the officials would also be very careful about how much emphasis they put on WWF title. Also, Hogan's match with Sid Justice was poor, and the run-in at the end was stupid. I expect that on ""Raw"" or ""Nitro"", but not on a PPV.Still, it's worth a see for the other matches. The first three serve a good looks at Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, and The Undertaker before they became main-eventers, and again, the WWF title match was a classic. I wish Flair(who's one of my all-time favorite wrestlers)had won, considering this is the only WWF PPV in print. Still, I guess there was no way they could have known. I wish the WWF hadn't stopped manufacturing the ""Summerslams"", ""Royal Rumbles"", etc.Worth renting, at least."
5,review from the swedish number one wwf fan,"I have to say that this is one of the absolute graitest Wrestlemania's ever in the history of the WWF. This event got's it all. Incredible titlematches souch as the IC-match between Bret Hart and Rowdy Piper and Macho Man vs. Rick Flair for the championchip. Also the match everybody thought was the last for the Hulkster Hulk Hogan when he smacked the face of Sid Justice, was a grait one. This is the wwf at it's best and if you doesn't have this video you should get right now."
4,Can't go wrong with a wrestlemania,"the Hogan/Justice match could have been better, but the return of the Warrior is worth it. Bret/Piper and Flair/Savage are great though"
3,WWF WrestleMania 8 Review,"This was a good WrestleMania, but it could have been better. First of all, the Justice-Hogan match was a good fight.... Since it was the last match on the card, it sucked. The world title match between Randy Savage and Ric Flair was very good one, but I didn't like the way Savage ... When he hit Ric Flair and rolled him up in a schoolboy, I wad thinking: """" He shouldhave [used] a flying elbow or something, not with a rollup pin. The IC Title match was an excellent match, and was the first time I saw Bret Hart bleed. ... You know, they call Piper a legend in the sport. Well, he's done many things for wrestling, but one thing he hasn't done is win a world title anywhere. In either WCW or the WWF, the best he could do was win the US or IC title. And when he won them, he only held them for about 2 months. But even though Piper isn't a legend, it was still a good match."
5,One of the best WWII movies. A classic of its time.,"In this story of U.S. army troops in the invasion of Italy, Director Lewis Milestone shows that a terrific film can be made with a minimum of special effects. The story relies on the characterizations of the U.S. soldiers and on smart writing which allows the viewer to identify with the men of the platoon. While I liked ""Private Ryan"" very much, this film does a better job of representing the U.S. citizen soldier in showing men who do their jobs well under fire not because they want to, but because they see that they have to."
5,One of my favorite WW-II movies,"I remember first seeing this film as a boy growing up in Southern California. Like Lewis Milestone's previous masterpiece, ""All Quiet on the Western Front, about men in combat during WW-I, this film tells a very personal story about what it means for ordinary men being in deadly combat situations. You learn about how much they miss being so far away from home and how frightened they are awaiting their unknown fate.After watching this film, you cannot but help feeling very sad how brutal and personal war is for those who have to fight it. IMHO, this is a must-see movie for those who want to learn more what war means at a very human level."
2,A Disappointing Stroll,"Both in terms of the quality of this DVD (no indexing, a 5 second break in the film, and dust on the lens at one point) and the movie itself, this one was a disappointment.While it deserved some credit when released for some degree of realism and the parts played by Dana Andrews and Lloyd Bridges, it is definately a product of 1940s/1950s Hollywood.Most of the supporting characters are the 1-dimensional ethnic stereotypes of the time - the WHITE Booklynite, the WHITE Jersery City guy, the WHITE mid-westerner, etc.Then there is the annoying and pointless movie song brought in from time-to-time sung by the stereotypical BLACK bartone. I kept waiting for the ""Old Man Ribbah, that Old Man Ribbah..."" reframe.Perhaps this movie was treading new ground when released, but its treading water now."
3,BORING!,Excellent dvd quality but story is boring. Know it is one of the 'big 3' war titles but also most boring.
1,MOre smoking ciggrets then anything,I am i war movie buff and i think this is the worst one i have ever seen. Its is all just talking and smoking ciggrets.I was so board i almost fell asleep. This is on movie i wish i have never bought.
5,Oustanding,"This is the first video I purchased, back when tapes first became available. I remembered the movie from the theater presentation. Truly an outstanding flick.The medic was the voice for the recording """"Peter and the Wolf"" among and cartoon features."
2,DVD is clear but broken,"The ""restored"" copy of ""Walk in the Sun"" is clear and crisp. The only problem is that the subtitles in English WILL NOT TURN OFF.I DID NOT PUT THE SUBTITLES ON, THEY ARE THERE AND WILL NOT TURN OFF."
1,Don't buy the DVD version!,"Great film (though not as good as ""Attack!""). However, don't, repeat DON'T buy the dvd version of this film. - The quality is simply appalling with a hugely bad compression ratio (honestly it's like watching a grainy movie clip on someone's website). The dvd also had a tendency to splutter to a stop on my dvd player. Now wonder the dvd is so cheap. I've no idea what the vhs video version is like, but it's got to be better than the dvd. 4 stars for the film overall but only 1 star for the dvd version!"
2,Not a restored version,"It is apparent that the copyright has expired on this movie, as a number of DVD houses are offering various versions. This transfer is moderately scratchy and occasionally fuzzy, and obviously slightly cropped.It is too bad the studio hasn't seen fit to issue a restored version (and copyright the restoration). Unfortunately, judging by the offerings here on Amazon, there is no studio version available."
1,Would have been great if they shipped it,"I ordered this as part of a larger order, and the product was not included in the package. After a week, I called the company, and comment they made was, ""Gee, I though your package seemed lite.""It will be a long time before I order another product from Swanson again."
5,Just Perfect,I read the review in the New York Review of Books and bought the book. I'm not disappointed. A. J. Liebling was just a wonderful writer!
1,Not the same,"This soap is NOT the same. My wife grew up in England and her father has used Imperial Leather since her birth. She says the scent is different. We have purchased the ""real"" Imperial Leather while in England, as well as had some shipped to us. We compared this order from others we had, and the scent is way off, it is harsh, chemically smelling, and burns the nose. I contacted Cussons, and they stated I may have gotten a bad batch. The problem is, I orderd 5 cases, recieved six, but they ALL are bad. Maybe that is why they are so cheap at this site. Dont chance it, pay the full price and get the good stuff."
3,lost scent,"I have used Imperial Leather soap forever.However recently I have noticed that lovely fragrance is missing. I contacted the manufacturer,PZ Cussons, who indicated that vegetable oil has replaced animal fat and some fragrances have been changed 'to complement the improved base'.Philip OgramVirginia BeachVa USA"
2,Recebi a minha compra pela metade!,O que foi anunciado era o blu ray duplo e um livro. Na imagem é isso que mostram. No entanto só me enviaram o blu ray duplo. O livro que deveria vir junto ao blu ray como consta na propaganda no foi enviado para mim.
3,"Rugged, but missing sound quality","Rugged great looking jobsite radio. And being reconditioned, it not only looks brand new, it works perfectly. The only downside is the lack of sound quality. I previously had a Dewalt jobsite radio. And the audio was hands down superior. Sorry! Maybe Milwaukee should look into beefing up their audio if they plan on making a newer version of this radio. But what the hell, it's a work radio!"
5,milwaukee jobsite radio,"great radio, 18 volt outlet to charge phone and plug ipod fm tuner to play personal music.fantastic speakers."
4,Green Lantern as he began,"Here is Martin Nodell's original Green Lantern as he began in the Golden Age.Learn how he discovered his lantern-powers,established an identity,got a worthwhile job-and met a true friend in Doiby Dickles.Bill Finger,author of many of these tales,also was the original author of Batman.His help to Martin Nodell was as valuable as his help to Bob Kane."
2,I love Earl Grey but not Twinings,"My experience with teas grows with time. I really love a good cup of Earl Grey. I bought Twinings Earl Grey and was disappointed. The bergamot is very acidic, the flavor was not enjoyable even with added sweet and milk. The tea was too weak for the flavor of the bergamot to be enjoyed properly. I love the Twinings tea tins and the ability to create my own cup of tea, but with this tea I have to add other tea to give the cup a good flavor."
5,My dog takes this product,I've been giving this to my lab mix for 3 years now. He suffers from arthritis in his hips. We've tried other combinations of glucosamine but this is the only one that works.
4,Cheaper than Walmart and much easier than going to the store and playing football with the people.,"Great product and much easier than going to the store to get it . By the time u drive there , itd costs you 10 dollars in gasoline and same for your time. ."
5,Wonderful TV!,"Beautiful color...beautiful resolution, beautiful sound. We have not found any negatives to this TV."
4,"Great Sony, but why the high price for this 720p vs a 1080p?","No complaints with the TV. Excellent picture, etc. But the specifications on this 46S3000 (Costco) aren't nearly as good as similar Sony models with with far better specs. Had initial problems with judder, but Sony customer service walked me through steps to alleviate this. Still, I am wondering why I've paid so much for this particular model. I DO like it, but I keep asking myself the question of whether this purchase is good value for the dollars spent."
5,Very funny collection of cartoons,"While I do not play golf at all, I can appreciate the humor of golf jokes and when reading this book of golf cartoons, I did a lot of appreciating. It is hilarious in the sick sense, sometimes gross, and other times engaging in sacrilege against the sacred sport of golf. These cartoons are some of the funniest that I have ever seen, independent of subject matter."
2,Addressed to wives of alcoholic husbands,"The title is dishonest and the book content is sexist. The book is written with the drunk being called ""he"", ""your husband"", or names like ""Harry"". (at least, every page I looked at, because of that problem I did not buy the book). The subtitle should say ""Learning to live with yourself and an alcoholic *husband*"". I had hopes of finding a good book for a male friend dealing with his destructively drunk wife. So far each book I have found whose title sounds promising ends up being addressed to the woman dealing with a drunk husband.For women dealing with alcoholic men, what I paged through looked decent, but the book will be a real misfire for those who bought it on the title alone"
5,GREAT,"If you know an alcoholic, or especially if you are a woman taking care of an alcoholic man who is constantly ruining your life, BUY THIS BOOK. It will make you cry with acknoledgement that your life is taken over by this DEVIL called alcoholism. You learn that alcoholism is the eternal excuse for the guy who ruins your life and you are stuck with the raw pain. This book is a slap in the face, a wake up call, a new realization."
5,Sanity in the midst of insanity,This book and author has had a profound affect on me! Reading it is like being thrown a lifeline in the midst of a raging insanity storm!It has helped me see - I'm NOT crazy. I CAN be whole. There IS hope. I encourage anyone in relationship with an alcoholic to get this book and start back on the road to wholeness!
2,not so good,"this book was very good about half way through, but then it basically told you to deal with the alcoholics disfunctions. to expect anything. how does one have hope when told "" it will never change "" i thought that the book should have been more about how to help. maybe give some tough love back. but when told over and over not to be upset. the alcoholic is sick. we know this. at what point is one responsible for their own life?"
4,Doc Martin The Movie,I have fallen in love with the Doc Martin series and loved this as well. Looking for more in the future.
2,Doc Martin movies,"The first one was not too bad but the second was a bit stupid, scenery was fantastic though. I think I prefer Doc Martin in his present rude format. Still worth watching."
5,Great intro to the show,I watched all five seasons of Doc Martin and then afterwards came upon the movie and it was really neat seeing a different take on Doc Martin. I enjoyed this quite a bit.
3,Series Better Than Movie,"Liked the doctor trying to reinvent himself in the movie; but, love the rude, disfunctional character in the series much better."
3,Will the real Doc Martin....,"Because I love the Doc Martin series, the movies were difficult to watch this ""version"" of the character. The movies were rather silly. I gave it as a gift and was disappointed. So was the person I gave it to, who is also a Doc Martin fan. Stick to Martin Clune in the series."
2,not much,"I think you will be disappointed as I was with these movies - the Doc Martin is by Martin Clunes but his lady friend (school teacher) is played by somebody other than we are use to seeing and she isn't very good. Actually, I was considering sending the movie back and letting Amazon sell it to somebody else!"
2,Not as good as the series,These movies were not nearly as entertaining as the TV series. Doc Martin does not have the same personality in the movies and TV series. I won't be watching them again.
2,Only one worked,The first disc was unreadable and we never we able to watch it. The second disc played fine and it was a good movie. But I paid for two movies and was only able to watch one because it would only work on UK DVD players or some such. Very disappointing.
1,Disappointed not worth the money,I thought this would be more like the Doc Martin series which it is not. I was very disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend this movie. Save your money the cost of this DVD isn't worth it. I am very disappointed in this product and price.
4,Doc Martin The Movies,Don' t expect the same cutting sarcastic personality the he portrays in the series. This is a much lighter rendition of Doc MartinDoes explain his relationship with the town and the movies are funny and lighthearted but this is not the Doc Martin from the television series. Still fun to watch however your just waiting for the Doc Martin from the series to flow out and it never happens.
4,A mixed bag,"The first movie was charming and much more like the series than the second, which was merely whacky and farcical. Overall, however, if you love the Doc Martin series, as we do, these movies are must-haves for your collection and give interesting insight into the creative inspiritation for the series."
2,Waste of money and time,Movie did not compare well to the excellent TV series of Doc Martin. Wasted my money on this one. Sometimes you strike out.
3,Not the same as Doc Martin the TV show,"We have absolutley loved all 5 seasons of Doc Martin the TV show, filmed in completely charming Port Isaac, which we had visited before we were aware of the TV show. Thus, we searched out both Amazing Grace (the movie, not the TV show) and then the two follow up Doc Martin movies which spun off from Amazing Grace. The Doc Marting movies are frequently called ""prequells"" to the TV show, but they are really not. The character of Doc Martin is QUITE different, and the story arc has nothing to do with the TV show. So the only real simularities are that Martin Clunes is the lead actor and they are situated in Port Isaac.The three movies are enjoyable enough - we rate them 3 stars - but not up to Doc Martin the series, which we would rate at 5 stars."
5,Wonderful,This is a wonderful movie and I love Doc Martin I would buy other movies the same way I brought this one and I thank you very much.
5,Wonderful Fun!,"We love the Doc Martin series and I bought the movies for my husband for Christmas and they did not disappoint. Now, I'll have to order the series from the beginning although we get an episode on PBS ever so often. We have a good friend from Bristol and she says this series is full of people and memories from her childhood. Thanks for offering it to America."
3,bummer,"the movies are nice, all you would expect from Doc Martin.But the first disk only plays on system 7 tray load???the second disk plays fine an both formats, and pocket or tray disk loaders.Why can't the movie moguls part with the pennies per disk to eliminate the bad experience of low quality control?"
2,not worth the money,"I rarely write reviews but I couldn't resist this one.The movie is absolutely stupid with a plot that might amuse 10-year olds. There is very little ""doc"" in Doc Martin such as interaction with patients. Instead, Doc crawl around, dressed like a swat team member, chasing after some ghost. I was most disappointed.I own all 5 sets of Doc Martin which I enjoy very much (I have viewed all 5 series several time and have learned to like the characters and, of course, the scenery. Doc Martin's personality is too much at times. Is he so full of hate that he seems incapable to show some tenderness towards his lovely wife?"
3,Early Doc Martin IS Different,"For fans of the modern Doc Martin, the Doc Martin in these movies is entirely different. He is sensitive, has a sense of humor, and enjoys human interaction. In other words, he lacks the very social ineptitude that makes the reincarnation of Doc Martin so enjoyable. It's no wonder he underwent a rewrite for his current version. Not that the earlier iteration in these movies was bad, it's just that the current version is so much better."
2,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of Martin Clunes and his Doc Martin series so I ordered this DVD. I found it disappointing, really quite silly plot. I plan on reselling it."
4,"Doc Martin, the start of it all","For us viewers in the U.S., this was another side of the Doc. The first movie was really good,highly reccommend it but the second was a tad boring. Oh well, all in all still worth buying and I am sharing them with my friends. We all love the Doc Martin series."
5,Doc Martin movies,"Love the series , love the movies , wish there was more . Some of the few things I like to see over again"
5,Fresh and hilarious,"I usually don't get British humor (e.g. Monty Python and Benny Hill), but I really enjoyed the Doc Martin series. The plot is unique, the characters are quirky but lovable, the locations are charming, and the acting is extraordinary."
5,A Gem,A beautiful gem of a book. Fantastic photographs and great stories about the wonderful displays at the museum. A must for anybody who's spent some happy hours in the museum.
5,NATURAL WONDERS AND HOW THEY WERE MADE,"This is a marvelous and beautiful book. It has great color photos of recreated natural settings--the dioramas that bring nature to life in the museum--and the text is a pleasure to read. The descriptions and additional photos not only tell about the scenes but provide innumerable details and stories about how they were made, and the very human and wonderful museum exhibition people who, with skill and ingenuity, created them--the world behind the scenes. Bravo!"
3,Cant get past the taste,"I love Yogi teas. But I cant get past the taste of this one. I'm sure the properties work, but I dont care for the taste."
5,It worked for me anyway,"I am one of those people who when they get a bad cold it eventually settles into the chest in a very bad way (family genes) and each time it takes longer and longer to really lose the cough and congestion. Last weekend the latest cold making the rounds hit me and head sorely congested I spotted this on the grocery shelves and decided to give it a shot. While it isn't the greatest tasting tea ever, my head did clear up enough so that I passed on the cold medicine for the night, and the cold had pretty much cleared up the next morning, and virtually no chest congestion at all."
2,"Just another ""Just say No"" book",I guess I had hoped for more than the same old song and dance. Yes kids need to be discouraged from drug use of all kinds---but shouldn't they also be taught that responsible use is possible? This book doesn't even touch on that subject. Wouldn't that be wise? This book states that our most dangerouse drug is LSD!!! NEVER stated is the fact that nicotine has killed more people than all illicit drugs AND alcohol combined. NEVER stated is the fact that not only are 75% of all car accidents alcohol related but alcohol is the #1 menace to our society . Disapointing.
1,Radio Does Not Work,"I bought this radio about a year ago and it has never worked correctly. Not once has it alerted us to a storm or tornado warning, which is why I bought it. Three different people have checked that our settings are correct for county codes, state, etc. It is set exactly as the instructions said, but has proven useless for weather alerts in my state (Alabama)."
1,It is a pass,"A very dispirited interpretation of Villalobos. The sound is almost inaudible and lacks the sometimes playful, sometimes relaxed overtones so characteristic in Villalobos."
5,FINALLY SOMETHING THAT REALLY WORKS!!!!!,"This stuff contains Pelargonium Sidoids. I've done my research on this because it works. It's actually some type of South African geranium. There are no side effects and it will kick a cold to the curb. Best to take at the very first symptoms. If you take it past the second day of a cold, you will still suffer, but not as much. I highly recommend this stuff. I have not had a cold in 2.5 years and I used to get them at least 4 times a year! They would always lead to bronchitus or sinus infections but no more! It is nothing short of a miracle! I used to buy ZUCOL but apparently UMCKA replaced ZUCOL. For the person that said it didn't work, and was a placebo effect, you must've started taking it too late in the cold progression. I am a living walking example of a miracle product."
4,Intriquing Attempt at DC,"Doom Patrol, as represented in the first volume of their Archives Edition, was an interesting attempt in the 1960s at DC to expand the notion of what makes a super-hero, along with Deadman, Challengers of the Unknown, Eclipso, and Metamorpho (most of these heroes created by Bob Haney, the author behind the Doom Patrol). Their resemblance to the X-Men is obvious although DC was never able to create an environment where the oddball heroes fit in as well with Superman, Batman, et al, whereas the X-Men never seemed out of place in the Marvel universe. But Doom Patrol's biggest weakness was its lack of stand-out villains. The X-Men had Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants while the Doom Patrol struggled along with General Immortus and the Brotherhood of Evil. The Doom Patrol stories are still quite charming, though, and show great promise for what could have been. It was an adventurous experiment at DC to create a team of outcast heroes that is worth checking out."
5,Book review,I The Lord have seen thy sorrow is an excellent book for therapists and clients to read. It reviews the hurt of infidelity but also how to recover together as a couple.
5,This Book is a Life Changer,When I read this book suddenly all the fear about the end of the world was gone. Afterwards I went about my life to try to make the world a better place. It gave me courage and hope and increased my faith in Jesus and my love for the scriptures.
5,A Great Book!,"John Bray understands what many pastors today wished they understood. He has clear interpretation to passages in Matthew 24 that have confused and continue to confuse the masses. Today, when I hear preachers attempting to create fear for their ""END TIMES"" view with words like, the coming of many anti-christs, wars, famines, sickness, great tribulation, as lightening comes, the coming of the Son of God, etc, etc etc, I shake my head and laugh! It would be the same as using the flood verse in the book of Genesis to frighten God's people the next time it starts to rain in their backyard. This is fulfilled prophecy clear and simple! The great thing about this book is you don't need to be a Greek scholar or an Old Testament professor to understand it, you can just be a simple person coming to a simple understanding of a clear and simple text. Read the book and it will transform your ministry and if it doesn't, ...read the book again!"
4,Getting things done inside an organisation if you are not the boss,"The style is very practical (some might say dumbed down), but the advice is sound. You will probably not find the message in this book a total surprise, but it is still quite nice to have it spelt out. There are a lot of one page examples in the book (as opposed to three-four page examples), which aids to the practicality of the book. The book can easily be read in one-two sittings.You won't get any academic references even tough the the author is an academic, but you do get one page of further reading.In addition, I would say that this book is great for undergraduate students because they are typically not exposed to the political nature of companies in their studies. So it will come as a chock for many that politics can be so important. So if you are a student, please read this book!"
5,Great practical book about politics or how to do it right in corporate environment.,"Simple, practical explanation on how to get your project accepted politically.Read it in a (full) day, start applying the next.Enjoy!"
4,"Practically applicable, but limited-term thinking","Being politically savvy - especially within a large organization - is crucial to the success of any project you want to drive that will have substantial impact on the organization. Political savvy, though, is easy to overdo and end up with you looking manipulative or power-hungry. This book does an excellent job instructing how to walk that line and still be successful without burning too many bridges.The only reason that this isn't a 5-star book is that it ignores the long-term story. There's another huge element that involves past performance and current support that you are also giving and is largely ignored. Additionally, the book doesn't hit on the importance of proper recognition of your early supporters at the successful completion of the project in order to ensure they're with you again the next time around. Still, though, this was a quick, enjoyable read, and I even picked up an additional thing or two."
5,Must-read to get new ideas implemented successfully,"This book is a must-read for anyone who want to consistently get new ideas implemented successfully. The book clearly presents the steps so that your initiatives can be successfully implemented. My personal experience in founding and running high tech company as well as working with large organizations confirm that political competence is a skill that can be and must be learned by everyone who want to get a team to achieve its goals. Political competence is a necessary skill for everyone in all areas irrespective of whether the area of expertise is sales, marketing, finance, information technology, research, education, government or non-profit. Reading this book and following the steps will definately increase your chance of getting your next idea implemented successfully within your organizations."
5,Elegant,"Great! Joy Eau De Toilette spray is a delightful and impressive scent. Because scent is not overwhelming, it is appropriate for daytime and evening."
5,Dimensions of pump,"Although I haven't installed the pump yet, I wanted to pass on the actual dimension of the pump because I could't believe it was 20 inches long as advertised. The motor body is 2-1/2 inches long and 2 inches in diameter. It is 5-3/8 inches to the outside of the tubing connectors."
2,water shoe,"The delivery service from Amazon was right on the mark. However, the product itself was dissapointing. After one day of my son wearing the Neoprene water shoes to his day camp, during sprinkler time, both insoles seperated from the shoes. It is a pain in the neck everytime he wears them to keep fixing the soles. After paying just about the same proce for shipping as the shoes cost, I was dissapointed in the endurance of the product. I would be very hesitent to purchase any future products from this company."
5,Fantastic,"No matter where you are, this is great music to listen to... in the car, while making dinner, or just sitting and reading a book. I tend to listen to CDs too often and get a bit tired of them, and off to the shelf they go. Not so with this... no matter what... it's just great music! It's on my ipod and in my car so it's always there, and it has yet to get ""old""."
4,Fire Inspector Study tool,This book is a great tool if you are taking the IFSTA fire inspector formatted test. If you are taking the NFPA test format it can be helpful in familiarizing you with certain aspects of the inspection realm.
5,Excellent,This prep helped me tremendously!! As a matter of fact a large portion of my state test were word for word the questions i studied in this book!
1,Weak Writing,"This author means well (I think), but his writing is weak and awkward. He actually uses the word, ""er,"" as if he were speaking to the reader, instead of writing to the reader. I think he might idolize Jack White (which is fine for a fan, but this feels a little too weird for me). You might like this book if you like this style, but it's just not for me. I really did try to like it and there are some neat facts to learn, but I just couldn't get past the poor syntax. I returned it and got another book, which I like better."
2,TOTAL POTBOILER,Fans of the White Stripes will undoubtedly find this interesting but it seems to have been written mainly to cash in on their current popularity and is genuinely one of the most poorly written books I've ever read: syntax and word-usage errors abound and there doesn't appear to have been an editor anywhere in sight. It reads like it was thrown together as quickly as possible and the author clearly had no direct contact with the band as all quotes come from second-hand sources. Pretty disappointing and it's hard to believe that the author is a professional writer: I'd be embarrassed to have something like this published.
3,I expected more,"This book is not worth reading if you're looking for a sophisticated political discussion. Press applies this broad notion of ""spin"" to a wide range of topics, including advertising, dating, sex, as well as politics. Although his description of spin in nonpolitical contexts is interesting, it is not novel and I would have preferred it if he'd stuck to politics.I'll give Press some credit for generally writing from a nonpartisan perspective. Although he's a liberal, Press describes the spin of both Republicans and Democrats. Often, however, the discussion is more humorous than intellectually stimulating..."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I've been following Mr. Press work ever since he joined Crossfire and I think he's one of the most poised, erudite and objective journalists on the left (with the exception of Christopher Hitchens). Moreover he is extremely funny. So when I saw that he wrote a book about spin I immediatly ordered it. Spin isn't a big thing (yet) in Europe, at least not on the continent, and since I work in politics I hoped to pick up one or two usefull suggestions on the subject. Alas that was not the case. Although undoubtedly funny and occasionally insightful this book was written mostly to amuse (and it did). Only I expected something else."
5,"Bill Press, Spinmeister Par Excellence","A delicious romp through the world of spin!!!As Bill Press's self-appointed ""#1 Fan"", I awaited release of this book with great anticipation; and, characteristic of his television personna, the book is intelligent, enlightening, and entertaining throughout. His sense of humor enables him to write without offending, even as one recognizes one's self in certain of his examples of spin.I hastily read the book as soon as I received it and enjoyed every page; however, just as one gobbles down a favorite food of which one has long been deprived, without really adequately tasting it, a subsequent reading, savoring every delicious morsel, provides even greater delight.Press's ability to totally enjoy himself, while providing truths, gift-wrapped in his wonderful sense of humor, provides the reader a delicious romp through the world of spin."
1,I was duped by false advertising!!!!,"I love Bill Maher. The first reference to this book was on a page about another Bill Maher book. That reference flat says ""By Bill Maher"", period!!!! Clicking on that reference gets you to the page from which I could write this ""review"". I notice it now says ""By Bill Maher (foreword)"". I was selecting items for my wish list for my family's benefit and selected everything by Bill Maher. So I didn't catch what I consider to be a MAJOR deception on the part of Amazon!! Literally all my internet shopping is done through Amazon because I consider them the very best the internet has to offer. But this baloney has to stop!!! I should not be required to read the fine print to insure I'm REALLY REALLY ordering something by Bill Maher or by somebody in whom I have zero interest. Shame, shame!"
1,warning....,"Please be aware this is a false advertisement. I paid extra dollars for this cream because it is advertised as ""product of Germany"". I ordered it a month ago. It finally arrived today. Guess what, the one I received looks different from the bottle shown here, and it's made in Thailand!! Cheaters, get your false advertisement of this site!!"
5,Best night cream I've ever used,"A number of years ago, my husband gave me some samples of Nivea Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream that he had gotten along with another product. I was immediately hooked. It is the best night cream I have ever used: it feels wonderful, for one thing, and I truly believe it has had the effect of lessening the wrinkles that are inevitable in the mid-70s. When I run out, it is even hard to get to sleep-- because it feels so soothing as part of the going-to-bed ritual!"
3,good,"When I bought this DVD, I was thinking that it was another Ralphie May stand up comedy. I was wrong, Ralphie May is the host and there are contenders that face one another in a ragging battle. Who can insult the most or the best. It was funny, some were just down right sad to listen to."
2,wrong form of B12,"What I like about Twinlab products is that they come in glass, so I'm not trashing the planet with more plastic. I've been happy with other Twinlab products for years. Sadly, I've learned about a serious problem with this B vitamin product. It contains the wrong form of B12--cyanocobalamin. According to the information I've received, this form cannot be digested without stealing methyl needed for other purposes. The form of B12 that is usable and best digested by the body is methylcobalamin. For most people taking it orally is not as effective as sublingually, or better yet, in a patch. I'm sorry I just bought a bottle of this, as it seems that taking it could be worse for my B12 levels than taking no supplement at all."
3,Bittersweet,"If you are looking to turn heads, this will do it, it is loud. The midpipe I hate because if you are not on the RPM's it will collect raw fuel in the resonators and it stinks. Droning is terrible with midpipe, not certain how it is without, and I am anxious to put the stock midpipe back in to find out. If it is your daily driver, it will be annoying to say the least, if you dont want to draw attention to yourself, dont put the midpipe on. It has a rasp at about 4200 rpm but it clears up before 5000."
4,nicely done - should be more hints for the price,"i saw the video on public tv first and liked it so i ordered it in hopes that the dvd would contain more hints than what was shown on tv but it didn't so, really, seen it already and spent money to see a re-run... hmm my problem, but it is entertaining just not for the price"
2,not quite up to expectations,"The hindges were not inlayed enough. When the board was layed flat the hindges stuck out raising the middle of the board off the table. The picture also lead me to believe the peices were held into place inside the case, they are not. They roll around freely in transport."
1,Try a Different Browne Book,"The illustrations are well done and quite funny, but the message for kids is not one I'd like to teach my girl. Willy tries lots of things - biking, swimming, soccer - and doesn't do well at any of them. This could be a good lesson in trying to find what you enjoy and that not everyone is good at sports, but the climax of the story left me baffled. Willy accidentally beats up the bully and becomes the hero. I don't get it. It seems he should have found something he enjoyed doing or that he was able to do well or there should have been a humorous end so it is just a fun book. As it is, it is a strange little childrens book with gorillas in bling, pantyhose and speedos and a little chimp who can't do anything he tries. The references in the drawings (Magritte, Marilyn Monroe) were lost on my 13-year-old stepdaughters, who thought this was the weirdest childrens book they had ever seen."
2,$20 ???,"This seems like an interesting book and I would buy this book for $10, but I'm sorry, $20 for an ebook?I know it's not Amazon's fault, it's the publishers fault. I guess I'll go see if the library has it."
3,Pump replacement motor,"This Rotom motor fits the Bell & Gossett pump as advertised. It pumps the hot water through our home heating system. What the Rotom motor doesn't do is run quietly, as the old Bell & Gossett motor did."
3,Not very sweet,"I bought this to sweeten my iced tea. Stevia powder is simply too powerful to measure out in such small quantities so I thought the dropper idea would be great; a drop or two and you've got nice, sweet tea. Unfortunately I find that it takes six or seven drops to make the tea as sweet as a single packet of Splenda. Given just a trace of stevia powder is needed to knock your socks off, this seems to be pretty dilute. I'll use this, but I won't be buying more.On the other hand, I don't notice any bitterness to it."
2,Just As Much Aftertaste as Others I've Tried,...and I'm just not crazy about eating glycerine and you can definitely notice it. Very disappointed--I'd recommend buying from a place like Whole Foods so you can try it and return it if need be.
5,Best liquid stevia I've found,"This is the best liquid stevia I've found. It has very little aftertaste, and I will be ordering this again and again."
2,"OK, OK, we get it!","While Nirvana is the best grunge band ever, I question the necessity of this album. It only spotlights the fact that Kurt Cobain has had abolutely no vocal training and slaughters his voice after a few straining notes. After that, it's like listening to someone gargling a mouthful of nails. While Grohl has moved on to something different, his playing is nothing spectacular either on this cd. Cobain takes almost every song too fast, therefore removing any sort of feeling from the songs, and then add in the poor sound quality, the frequent mistakes from the musicians, and you have this cd. While it is interesting to listen to bands playing live, I sure hope this show was much more entertaining to watch than it was to listen to."
3,Not the best selection...,"When this cd came out I was so excited to rush out and get it, but it was quite the letdown. Personally I think this is their worst cd, and would not reccommend it. Try In Utero or Bleach instead."
5,This Kicks,"This CD is awesome!! It is one of the best Nirvana CD's. If you don't have it buy it!!! Kurt was the man, he lives on."
4,"Pretty good, but there are better","This live CD is important because the live Nirvana sound is so raw and full on and is the essence of who Nirvana were. Of course there are fans who will say 'Oh that track should've been there' and so on and I have read somewhere that there may be a companion collection coming out, which would be great. There are also a number of live bootlegs around and I have one which sounds heaps better than 'The Muddy Banks.' It has no information with it but was clearly a post Nevermind pre In Utero gig. The point is that you hear every clap/yelp/scream of the audience and buzz/squawl/howl of the band. If anything, I think that 'Muddy banks' is too clean, and has lost some treble, so sounds a little thin.P.S. Kurt was dumb. There could've been so much more great music. He is NOT a hero, but an artist."
4,"Sweet, but not as sweet as MTV Unplugged","This is another live CD. It is good, but not as good as MTV Unplugged (my opinion). It is not like Unplugged in the way that everything is connected. Each song is usually from a different concert. The CD cover has the most photographs of all the Nirvana CDs and there is a biography. Ending note: NIRVANA RoCkS! Kurt Lives On~~"
5,Greatest Hits Performed Live,"Usually i try to avoid live cds, but the track listing drew me in on this one. It had all of their mainstream songs, i.e. Teen Spirit and Heart Shaped box among others, but what really completes the cd for me is the songs from the Bleach and Incesticide cds. Songs such as School,Aneurysm,and Blew really make this cd worthwhile. You can really hear the pain in Kurt's voice when he belts out these lyrics,which is one of the reasons this band is so appealing in the first place. This cd is definetly not studio quality, but it has a very raw feeling that just adds to the experience. I would highly recommend this cd."
4,Has Kurt got tourette's in this album?!,"This album is OK, it is creepy though, there are some awful, awful tracks, I mean really bad! AKA ""Milk It"". But its ok for a live album, MTV unplugged was much better but this isnt a bad album in the Nirvana legacy. Ill list my favourites from this album and rate them out of 5.Drain You..4Smells like Teen spirit...5 (1991-early 1992 must've been the only time the band liked to play this!)Lithium..3Scentless Apprentice..4.2 (scary, but good)Heart Shaped-Box...5Polly..4tourette's...5!!!!! I LUV THIS VERSION BUT WHAT RUINS IT IS HE DOSENT SAY ""moderate rock"" AT THE START LIKE ON ""IN UTERO"" but its just as good.and thats it, all the rest are average for my likings, I may not just like the actual song.Its an OK album straight up, but definitley not as near close to MTV unplugges"
4,good cd,That guy who said nirvana was the worst band to ever happen to music doesn't know what he is talkling about. Nirvana is one of if not the best bands ever. This cd sounds like it was a bootleg cause it all sounds like one preformance not like song then stop then another song. Its like it would be if you were there and that is what makes it cool. If you never got to see them in concert this is then next best thing.
2,not a good live performance,"I am sorry Nirvana fans, but Nirvana does sound a lot better in studio, especially Cobain. The only fairly good performance by them on the CD is Smells like teen spirit. I am pretty disappointed with it. Nevermind is 10 times better."
2,Unplugged Is Much Better For a Live Recording,"I got this record believing that this record would have the same great quality as the previous records I had boughten (""Nevermind"" & ""In Utero"")and I was surprisingly shocked. In this record it sounds like Kurt Cobain was doing a few many drugs before the show. If you are going to buy a live record buy ""Unplugged"" and you will not regret it. Included in that cd is many of their hit songs along with some cover songs you won't find anywhere else. I also need to add that I noticed that everyone that reviews Nirvana talks about ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"".......ouch. If you are a true Nirvana fan that is not even close to a favorite song. You guys should be listening to ""Rape Me"" or ""Dumb"" or ""Heart Shape Box"". Well anyway guys, buy their other CDs first and if your a real fan buy this cd."
1,How'd a band THIS awful become so popular? Butch Vig,"The Amazon editorial review has to be for laughs. ""Indeed, it's impossible to dwell on the maudlin when listening to these renditions of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" ""Sliver,"" ""Heart-Shaped Box,"" and ""Negative Creep""--they're too loud and too full of life. "" Who came up with this bullsh*t? The live songs on here are horrible, and they are performed half-arsed at best. But as bad as Muddy Banks may be, there is worse in the Nirvana back catalogue. After listening to With the Lights Out, you'll be begging for someone to put in this CD (or any CD besides that horrendous cash cow of a boxset). Yes, folks, there is a worse Nirvana release than this. Geffen obviously didn't care about any quality control for With the Lights Out. It's releases like Muddy Banks and With the lights out that make you wonder how such a sucky band became so popular. Blarg."
5,Like you're there...,"I'm not gonna say much because I'm listening to it right now, and teen spirit is on. I wish I were born earlier... I'd have had the chance to see them live, something I'll always have to imagine. Absolutley spectacular live versions of their songs, SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER than the box set (though those were mostly demos)... It's Like they're right in front of you... BUY IT NOW! (New fans beware... listen to studio versions first to appreciate this performance).Beatles, Zeppelin, Nirvana, and Radiohead all F'ing RULE!"
5,Please do me a favour and love live albums...,"To everyone who has had or still does have an ambition in music, also loves Nirvana, you all have to have this record. It's a success in the world of music and recordings anyways... The tracks are chosen exactly the way it suits your ear and also put together so it seems the right people have made this compilation of live Nirvana performances. Intro is definitely the one, Kurt screaming before the School song riff is played. All the songs are amongst the Nirvana famous ones and the sound is great! The atmosphere can be relived once for ever for this great rock n' roll band. Buy it!"
4,"""Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more.""","This is what Nirvana sounds like when they haven't been polished up in the studio. Their sped up versions of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Lithium"" sound better this way in my opinion. ""Blew"", ""Scentless Apprentice"", ""Heart Shaped Box"", ""Breed""....they're all great. If you never got a chance to hear Nirvana while they were around this CD is the closest you'll get to hearing what they brought to the stage."
3,Average,"Frankly, I was rather disappointed by this album. After the flat MTV Unplugged, I was eager to hear what Nirvana really sounded like live. unfortunately, this album didn't satisfy me. Not that the band doesn't rock--they do with reckless abandon. However, too many of the songs sounded like carbon copies of the studio versions. Perhaps I was expecting vast transformations where all the band wanted to do was satisfy the ravenous cowds. My recommendation to the uninitiated is to pick up either Nevermind or In Utero instead."
1,I ordered a CASSETTE and i got a CD,well...in the product description it said that it was an audio cassette but instead i got a used cd.the music is there but it is not what it said it was.I want my Nirvana CASSETTE!
4,Louder than love.,"As much praise as the ""Unplugged in New York"" album gets, I really question if that's the more essential live album. It is amazing, no doubt. But THIS is what ""Nirvana"" was. THIS is the ""Nirvana"" that became popular. And as good as the unplugged stuff is, THIS is the ""Nirvana"" that I want to remember. For every unplugged show they did, I'm sure they 1000 plugged-in ones. Despite the setlist here being from different dates, you don't notice it at all. Plus the song selection itself is mostly what it should be. At least it has ""School"", ""Smells like teen spirit"", and ""Scentless apprentice"". I'd say once you have ""Nevermind"" and ""Unplugged"", you need to get ""From the Muddy Banks of the Wishka"", especially if you never saw them live."
4,From The Muddy Banks Of Wiskah - Review,"This was the Nirvana live album everyone had been waiting for, some like it and some dislike it. I'm inbetween. This album has a few good live versions of songs like ""Aneursym"", ""Sliver"", ""Scentless Apprentice"", ""Negative Creep"", and ""tourette's."" When I got this album back in 1997 it was cool cause I never had the chance to see Nirvana live. It got old fast. The big let down for me anyway was the song selection. It didn't include some of my favorite's like ""About A Girl"", ""In Bloom"", ""Territoral Pissings"", ""Rape Me"", and ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter."" This album should have been a two cd set. It's good, but not the best live album ever for sure. Unplugged In New York was much better."
4,purity,"Nirvana stripped of all the studio exactness and production. This is how they sounded. This and Unplugged should be packaged together just to show the emotional range that Cobain's voice threw out. Not as good as Unplugged though (their best CD IMHO).On a second note, I'm glad of all the kids still tuning into Nirvana. This is what the 90's stood for, not all the knock off bands now (Eve 6, etc.)"
2,It's mediocre.,I've had this CD for a year and I've listened to it maybe 3 times. Nirvana is my favorite all time band but the songs don't sound as good live as they do in the studio and this album had nothing new on it. Nirvana's worst album.
2,Not The Best Of Nirvana,"I personally don't think this a great or good CD. It barely gets a ""fair"" rating. My two favorite Nirvana songs, ""Lithium"" and ""Heart-Shaped Box"" are over-done and pretty much the opposite of their studio versions, especially ""Lithium"". Not helping their rating is that my all time favorite Nirvana song, ""Territorial Pissings"" is left out. If you want Nirvana live, then check out, ""Live, Tonight, Sold Out!"""
4,"Mostly great, but some need a lot of work","Like K. Rowland (a reviewer) said there are some damn good songs on this album, but some, like the infamous live version of Breed needed a lot of work. Dave and Krist are both great musicians and it bothers me to think ""What the hell is such a crappy version of 'Smells like Teen Spirit' doing on this album""? when Smells like Teen Spirit is probably Nirvana's best and most famous song. But some songs however, like the notorious 'Milk It' and 'Scentless Apprentice' are near perfect with accurate guitar riffs, loud and melodic vocals and lyrics that sound the same on the studio albums. Overall I like this album, I love this album. I love because of 11 great tracks and 6 butchered and\or burned tracks.Best song: Milk It2nd Best Songs: Scentless Apprentice and School3rd Best songs: Blew, tourettes, Lithium2nd Worst Songs: Heart-shaped Box, Smells like Teen SpiritWorst Songs: Breed"
4,cool cd-shows you wot nirvana were really like...,"cool cd-wen i first bought this cd, and heard thefirst track, i thought it woz a load of crap, and i was beeing ripped off.but now i really like it, and i think it really represents Nirvana live."
5,A must have Live album,"I think Nirvana is great and all their CD's are good. You may think, ""Well, it's a live album so the sound won't be good,"" but you're wrong. Muddy Banks has better sound than I thought. The songs are faster than there originals in some cases, but still really good. Some stand out songs are Heart-Shaped Box, Sliver, and Breed. A must have for any Nirvana fan."
4,NIRVANA,"muddy banks is pretty good if it's your only nirvan cd, but if you already have nevermind it could be irrating because all the songs are like ten times faster."
5,I can't stop screaming along with this Cd! You must have it!,"THIS CD HAS THE RAW, LIVE POWER OF NIRVANA, WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BANDS EVER. THE INTRO BLEW MY EAR DRUMS OFF! KURT SCREAMS IN THESE SONGS LIKE HE'S RELEASING HIS DEMONS. DAVE AND CHRIS ABSOLUTELY ROCK ! CALL ME A BABY BUT ""SPANK THRU"" MAKES ME CRY. DRAIN YOU IS FANTASTIC, AS ALL THE SONGS ARE. I FEEL AS IF I'M IN THEIR CONCERTS OR AS IF I'M LIVING THE MOMENT. PLEASE GET THIS CD."
3,nirvana fan from vermont.,"Yeah, it's okay. I particularly like the songs, ""Been a Son"", ""Negative Creep"", and ""Lithium"". ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" sucks and so does ""Drain You"" (in this album). ""Aneruysm"" is okay, but my favorite is ""Heart Shaped-Box"". ""Scentless Apprentice"" sounds like he's rapping and it hurts my ears. But it's supposed to be a ""treasury""-right? I'm sorry but i'm too nit-picky. Especially when it comes to Nirvana."
3,Disappointed,"Nirvana's live material tends to be pretty good, but this truly is not the best of the best as Krist put it. It's simply average. If you really want some top-notch live Nirvana, get their Unplugged in NY CD. I wish I could give that one 6 stars."
2,"OK, but not very!","I bought this CD knowing next to nothing about the group but relying totally on a good review I had read. It was a disappointment. Johnny Kidd & the Pirates had their heyday in the late 50s/early 60s and are probably best known for the original version of ""Shakin' All Over"" which the Guess Who took to much greater heights.Kidd (born Fred Heath) does not have much of a singing voice and aside from ""Shakin"" none of the songs are memorable. It's understandable why the group never was able to have an impact in the States. When the beat boom occured in the UK, they were just unable to keep up. I think the biggest hook they had was Kidd's eyepatch and the pirate costumes so they probably generated a lot more excitement in live performances. On a positive note, the liner notes were very good."
3,It's OK if you're completely in the dark.,"This book is for someone who's really not done any research and is JUST starting out. If you've looked online and read articles, then this book might not be for you. I found a few things like questions to ask vendors helpful, but it just wasn't the end all be all.The book's too small to really write on so if you want to use the worksheets you're going to have to copy & blow them up. Which means you're shelling out money for that and you're shelling out money for the notebook to keep them all in.It's a good companion."
4,Simply wonderful!,Loved this book!!! The book title says it all!I love this book. I will definitely give this to my newly engaged friends!
2,Teresa Dorsey,"Some good information in this book, but should have been spiral bound and possibly organizing pockets inserted throughout so would have made it easier to organize.I would not buy this book again due to the facts written."
3,Good CD..... But not for a sleeping child,"This is an excellent CD. The choices are well performed, as would be expected from the London Symphony Orchestra. However, if you are not familiar with classical music and/or the specific selections on this CD you should be aware most of these selections are somewhat ""upbeat"" and best for getting your mood up or background music for playtime with your child. If you are looking for a cheap lullaby CD this is not it. But if you are looking for a good introduction to classical music that is well performed with classic selections - then this CD may be for you."
5,Very Sturdy and Stylish,"This is a very nice carrier. It's stylish and sturdy. My friends often mistake this bag for a real purse. It's great because the case fully zips, and the pet cannot escape. Shipping is very fast."
4,Get Face to Face With the Great Ones,Goes well with Revival of the Fittest also edited by Meggs. This sample book is different in that the faces shown were chosen by other designers. The faces seen in this book are the ones that you will be using 95% of the time. It is always good to study the classic faces in detail to get a better sense of their character and see the posibilities in their shapes.
4,Synchronicity Explained,"""Synchronicity An Acausal Connecting Principle"" is a must read for those interested in the subject of synchronicity. At 115 pages this book is deceiving at first glance as it appears to be a quick read. However, it is difficult to get through, not because it is uninteresting - but really because it is fascinating and much of the thought in this work is new and is counter to traditional thinking. The translation is good, although it would be nice to have a new simplified version released which ""dumbs down"" some of the complex concepts. A fascinating book and well worth the time and effort."
2,Bad writing on a great subject,"The subject matter of this book deserves a 5, the writing deserves a 0. Jung should have taken a course on writing - he used typical psycho babble and unnecessarily complex wording to discuss the concept of synchronicity, which is an incredibly interesting topic. Unless you know latin, greek (yes he actually wrote some quotes in greek letters), and have a good understanding of astrology, I suggest you find one of the many contemporary books on the subject to read. If, like me, you feel you have to go to the source to get a better understanding of the topic, then I suggest that, at a minimum, you skip the chapter on astrology, or, better yet, skip the entire book, and read only the appendix. In the 10 or so pages of the appendix, he summarizes the entire book.Bad writing on a great subject."
4,A Good Read and Enjoyable Series,"At first I was skeptical of a series of Sherlock Holmes mysteries that featured both the detective (aged) and a young girl--and I did think the series started a bit slowly. Further, in all the books to date, there is far too much verbiage on minutiae, such as endless descriptions of clothing, interiors of houses, and food. However, once I got into the pace of the writing (and it was good enough to keep my attention as long as I skipped paragraphs of details on kippers, wallpaper, and shoes) I came to enjoy all of the Mary Russell books and look forward to the next one."
4,The Game is afoot,"It's the dawn of 1924, and the Holmeses, husband and wife, have been enlisted by brother Mycroft for a bit of espionage, providing some much-needed distraction for the pair, whose individual interests had been flagging of late. Their mission is to find the elusive Kimball O'Hara, the famed 'Kim' of Rudyard Kipling's book, who has gone missing somewhere near the Khyber Pass. Thus our heroic duo become absorbed in the Great Game, the cat-and-mouse world of postwar international intrigue between Britain and Russia centred on the upper subcontinent. Assuming disguises and false identities has by now become almost routine for the pair, and they carry it off with their usual style. Once they decide to approach the problem from separate directions, however, at the remote palace of an idiosyncratic maharajah, all hell breaks loose. An engaging introduction to the area and the times in a place unique in all the world."
2,with a magnifying glass you can find Sherlock Holmes in this volume.,"This book is wonderfully descriptive but generally lacking in plot. Mary Russell is extremely competent, resourceful, and generally well dressed - at no point in the book are we in doubt about her wardrobe - and whether she purchased it, borrowed it, improvised it, or is in disguise. We are similarly illuminated about her surroundings - she would narrate a wonderful travelogue. Sherlock Holmes is mentioned from time to time, but the main character is mostly an English version of Rudyard Kipling's Kim, not Conan Doyle's Holmes. So it might be fairer to say that Ms. King has written a Kipling type novel than to associate it with Conan Doyle."
1,Phooey on Ms King,Pedantic. Boring. Waste of time. Shallow and trite characters. All the nasty events turn out well due to mere cirumstance.There is no mystery so there is nothing for Sherlock Holmes to do.Mark that statement: This author assumes the privilege of including Sherlock Holmes in the story line and he serves no purpose at all. No red herrings. No feints. No clues. No puzzles. A pathetic misuse of one of the great characters of mysteries and detective stories.This author successfully ripped off the buyers at my public library. Don't let her do it to you.bogiesan
1,awful,Another pathetic pastiche for feminist attempting to make Sherlock Holmes more palatable for the female gender.
4,A fun game,"This exciting story, set in India, follows the search for a lost British agent, the original ""Kim"" character in Rudyard Kipling's book. He has been a mole in Indian, working for the crown, and hasn't been heard of for 3 years. Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holms use disguises and travel India searching. Fun! Danger!"
5,Adventure Abounds,"Mary Russell, the much younger, part jewish and equal on all terms, wife of Sherlock Holmes is on another exciting case. This one takes them to India via cruise ship in search of Kimball O'Hara, the now grown up Kim of Kipling fame. On the way, the meet a suspicious American, with mother and sister in tow; a precocious youth who joins them in their quest and an Indian Price who is more than meets the eye.The games afoot!I love these books for their adventure, the history and the characters. Ms. King remains as true to the original Holmes as I would ever want and creates new stories with the fabulous character of Mary Russell.If you are new to this series, I'd start at the beginning with The Bee Keeper's Apprentice. If not, I would get this book as quickly as possible."
5,A Pleasant Hike For The Mind,"While ""A Beekeeper's Apprentice"" remains my favorite of this series, this book is just a pleasure to read. History, adventure, mystery, and just plain fun."
4,another good effort,"I liked this book very much. The details of life in a prince's palace were fascinating, particularly the pig sticking. The book moves right along for one so richly detailed. I enjoyed the first portion somwhat more than the end; I had the feeling it was wrapped up to fit into a specific page count and could have been much more detailed; a slightly too ""pat"" resolution. However, several story lines were left unfinished and I look forward to seeing them carried forward in the next intallment. I recommend this book, but would start as a new reader of Laurie King with the Beekeeper's Apprentice."
3,Disappointing,"Unfortunately I found this book to be very slow to start. For me, the action didn't heat up until about 1/2 way through the book. It was much more enjoyable from this point."
4,amazing style & mixing ability,"I'm not a big Pappa enthusiast but when i saw the tracklist for CD1, it had me sold.Cd1 starts with the chilled ""Into the storm"" by Luke Chable and progresses into some very melodic breakbeats. It has a very calm mood with groovy basslines and includes standout tracks such as ""Michael Burns - Sunshine in my shadows"", ""Main Element - Delta of Venus"" and the beautiful ""Mana"" from Shiloh.Cd2 takes the very deep dark progressive edge, dark vocals and chunky beats is the layout for most the tracks with these standouts: ""Ozgur Can - Connected"", ""Musgrove & McGrath - Freakout"", ""Shpongle - Beija Flor"". The last trakc on the albym ""beija flor"" is an amazingly produced tune blending upbeat breakbeats with spanish guitars and brazilian chanting vocals, however im not quite sure it fits the style of the cd.I personally prefer cd1 down to the fact that im a breakbeat fan and just about every track is a hit for me. Fans of prog house will drool over cd2"
2,Not very accurate,This manual does not provide a very accurate representation of that you'll find in your Hyundai. It's and OK tool to have but certainly not the best.
1,Never again,"It has now been over a month since I purchased the book Harry's Game on Amazon.com.Their procedure calls for me to contact the vendor to inquire as to why it hasn't yet arrived.The vendor assured me that it would arrive no later than July 9th...... it hasn't.This will be the final purchase that I ever make on Amazon.comAnd, I find it utterly amazing that I have to ""rate"" this ""train wreck"" of an unfilled order with at least one-star just to complete this form."
2,Save your money,This is made well but it's clumsy to use and the shortness of the tool does not give great crimping leverage. My good old linesman pliers does the same job better.
2,ROMY BEAUTIFUL & GREAT AS EVER-DVD NOT SO GOOD,"Romy Schneider was not only a stunningly beautiful and charismatic woman, but also one of the deepest, most sensitive and touching actresses the world has ever known. She is great as ever in this movie, esp. the latter half. Unfortunately the DVD is very bad quality,taken from an old dusty print with badly dubbed English. But thank god for the dvd remote, way too much time is spent on long shots of the train,etc and old newsreel footage instead of on Romy and Jean Louis Trinignant.I guess they didnt have enough of a plot to sustain a whole film. Too bad the movie and the dvd arent good,but Romy is Romy, truly a one of a kind star. This dvd is strictly for Romy fans."
1,Dubbed in English,I was very disappointed to find out this video was dubbed in English. It wasn't at all what I expected. I am returning it and hope the seller will give me credit although it was opened. I didn't even watch more than 2 minutes of the movie. I'd seen The Last Train before but it wasn't in English. I expected it to be in the original French language.
3,"Fine, if you are a Romy Schneider fan","This movie is fine if you are a Romy Schneider fan. As always, she looks wonderful in almost every shot. However, the story is not well fleshed out and the characters lack depth, at least to me. The color is not very good, but this is the case in just a few scenes."
5,Music and the Spoken Woard,A delight to read the many thought provoking snippets of past programs. Your service was much apprerciated in getting this out of print book to me.
5,nobody weeps for the dead quite like me,If'n you don't already know these guys are from Spain and they play 80's type power metal mixed with Celtic music using the violin and flutes and all the lyrics are in spanish. I don't really understand spanish but that's not important to me but what is important is that the music is good also you pay more attention to the music if you don't understand the words. However I've read from other reviews that these guys have some pretty meaningful and funny lyrics.I think the the first disc has the best songs on it and alone it's worth 5 stars but I don't really care for most of the 2nd because it doesn't really reach out and grab my attention and I easily get bored with about half of the songs. Both discs are full of fast paced rockers and beautiful ballads.I would recommend this album to any one who likes power metal whether or not you understand spanish because either way you'll like these guys and their blend of metal and folk music.
5,MAGO DE OZ....Maestros!!,"FINISTERRA..es magnífico, la letra y sonido impresionantes, la canción FINISTERRA es mi favorita; además de FIESTA PAGANA y SATANIA, este es mi primer album de la colección que tengo de MAGO DE OZ.Son unos Maestros; la rica fusión METAL-PROGRESIVA-CELTA, con violín y flauta, le da un sonido UNICO...dichosamente el 28 de marzo del 2003 estuve en su concierto en San José, Costa Rica y pude comprobar su calidad, así como la indentificación que logran con su seguidores...noche inolvidable de magia.Recomiendo comprar todos sus Albumes...son piezas de arte...realmente Música!!"
4,giddy with narrative,"Matthew Ritchie creates colossal semi-abstract paintings and installations, generated (somehow) by a complicated set of undergirding narratives, which are populated by characters which personify religions, archetypes, and scientific theories. Pretty heady stuff, and the essays in this book make valiant attempts to cast some light on Ritchie's project, with varying degrees of success. Maybe not clarifying (ultimately), but always compelling."
4,Life affirming!,"I ordered this book hoping it would be good, and I wasn't dissapointed. This is a great primer for those who wish to supplement Miss Rand's writings. It is clearly written and a fast read, to boot. Buy it!"
5,A remarkable book,"Loving Life explains with great clarity and simplicity the fundamentals of moral values and happiness, and why a person should follow the dictates of his reason and reject faith. This is a book everybody should read."
3,Different Profile,"The songs in this album are very different and nice to hear.The song ""Eulogy"" is Jay Lawrence's sombre and moving tribute to the heroes of the September 11th flight that crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside, preventing the terrorists from reaching their intended target. Like so many of us, Jay was particularly moved by the reports of the patriots on board gathering their courage with ""Let's Roll!"" ."
2,Too little songs,"I was disappointed by this CD as I was expecting song after song, which I have come to expect from other Barney CDs, which my daughter has been listening to and loving for over a year now. Although having ""white sound"" in between songs may be helpful to younger babies, it just makes my toddler (and me too!) anxious to hear the next melody. Not recommended for toddlers, even if they are Barney fans."
4,My sons love it so much,"Though it is just a simple CD, my son loves so much and always listens before he went bed. I used to have a crapy cassette tape, now I got the CD and have thrown the old cassette tape away."
5,"""Really Rosie"" CD","Exactly as promised. Japanese writing on case, but lyrics and music are original to the old school Rosie. Quality recording."
5,SO GLAD I FOUND THE VIDEO AND SOUNDTRACK CD,"I loved this movie and the music by the wonderful Carole King and Maurice Sendak. I was 8 years old back in 1975 when this movie was broadcast on TV. The great songs I still remember.The music in the movie led me to become a fat of Carole King's music, and also influenced my sound for deep heart felt soulfull music.I am so glad Amazon has the video and soundtrack. The music is timeless, when I hear the music it brings me the joy I felt when I was 8 years old again...PEACE & BLESSINGS"
2,But where's the kids?,"Maurice Sendak makes even the most bitter jaded adults kids again. You need the children singing it to really enjoy it. With the kids, it's 5 stars and happiness. Without it, it's just Carole King singing Maurice Sendak. Okay, but missing something.The songs are absolutely wonderful as always. BUT, what I really want is the original with the kids. Until then, pass on this."
2,Where is Rosie REALLY?,"These are all the great songs from the musical, but for the life of me I can't find the soundtrack to the real musical itself. I'll bet it's out of print, but it shouldn't be. To my mind, this cd is not nearly as good as hearing the real kids from the show sing these songs. I grew up listening to this musical on an old school record player, and its still one of my favorite things. I'm in college now, and desperately trying to find it. Every kid should have this musical."
4,Mid 70's Kid Memories Still Alive,"This was the soundtrack to an animated TV special in 1975. It relates the story of Really Rosie, a young girl growing up in the city, and the way she deals with life. It is a great CD for kids as it teaches them about the alphabet (""A Alligators All Around""), numbers (""One Was Johnny""), and what can happen to you if you stop caring (""Pierre""). It brings back many memories."
4,Great rare find for Carole King fans,"Not long after her overwhelming success with TAPESTRY C. King collaborated with Maurice Sendak for this 1975 television special. There are at least 5 wonderful songs on this album from the title song to ""Chicken Soup With Rice"" (classic King 70's sound-fun!) that will have you and your kids dancing in the living room."
3,Where Is the Full Cast?!,"Carole King has written an excellent collection of songs for ""Really Rosie"", but her vocal performance can't compare to the exuberance and sheer attitude that can be heard on the original recording of the full live musical (about an hour long with complete text, more songs, and incredible orchestrations.) I used to listen to that record when I was a kid (which is about fourteen years ago now) and I could still remember most of the music and lyrics before I picked up the TV recording. It's great to hear these songs as sung by the composer, but it would be even more great if someone would re-release that original cast album on CD, particularly if it included all of the original (and spunky) dialogue. Here's hoping that some intelligent record executive happens to read this review."
3,LOOKING FOR OLD VERSION REALLY ROSIE,I AM ALSO GLAD THAT REALLY ROSIE HAS BEEN RE-RELEASED. IT HAS BEEN OUR FAMILY FAVORITE FOR YEARS. BUT MY OLDEST DAUGHTER(23) AND I WERE DISSAPOINTED WHEN WE COMPARED IT TO THE OLDER SOUNDTRACK PERFORMED BY CHILDREN. OUR CASSETTE IS GONE AND WE ARE TRYING TO REPLACE IT. HELP!
1,BAD BOOK,"This book from the beggining just throws concepts at you, assuming that you will understand what they are trying to say. Then go over so many things without a thorough explanation of the topic. It shows you code and then don't explain it. If you are a beginner don't even think about buying this book. I read up to hour 6 but I couldn't handle it anymore, there were so many questions unanswered."
5,Excellent for small hands,Only gloves I have found that fit my small hands (short fingers) so that I can actually feel what I'm washing/cleaning. Nice thickness to the gloves that keep hot water from feeling too hot. Great length so water doesn't get into the glove. I bought 4 pairs and will continue to use these for everything.
5,Plastic Living Gloves size small,"These gloves are just my size. My hands are very small. There is still a little extra room in the fingers, but they fit better than any gloves I have ever purchased. They are easy to put on and take off. I will order them again when I need them, since they are hard to find in the stores."
5,Best work rubber gloves,"These gloves are the best gloves I have tried to date.I use them to handle meat before cooking, slicing produce, and washing dishes. I even use them for painting my walls. They last a very long time, fit well, and are slip resistant. I used to find them at home depot and walmart but for some reason trying to find this product locally is like hunting for gold! I highly recommend them."
5,Perfect Gloves!,"I wash a lot of dishes and am always trying different types of gloves - these by far have been the best; comfortable, nice fit (I have small hands and the small fits perfectly) and very durable. I wash everything with hot water and the gloves protect my hands from the heat. Also, the water catching cuff feature keeps water from getting into the gloves. Love! I will keep purchasing these gloves as long as they are around (hopefully for a long time!)"
3,Great protection but too big for my small hands.,"This is a great glove to clean with. Durable & protects against hot water. That said, I'm using them only for tough household cleaning & not for dishwashing, which is what I wanted for protection against constant washing. They are too big for my small petite hands & after several attempts at using them, I'm frustrated! I have almost dropped glass items 'cause they're simply too loose. And, Playtex apparently doesn't make an extra small. sigh*"
4,Dishwashing glove review,"This product is pretty solid. Great for anyone who wants to avoid dishwasher-hands and preserve the integrity of their baby soft skin. The only thing is that after a few months, did start to notice the growth of mold spores on the outside of the gloves, but maybe I just need to air them out better."
1,I did not get what I thought I ordered,"The site was mis-leading. The T42 optional battery is a 6600mAh battery. The vendor shipped 4400 mAh battery. So I'm out the shipping and the 10% restocking charge.Even Amazons picture of the battery in your request for review was the 6600mAh battery, Just like the one to the right!So no... I'm not a happy camper!"
1,Disappointed:,I was disappointed with this book. Since it said Hallelujah on the cover I though it was raw food recipes. I will be giving it away for a gift when I need something for a gift the next time.This book should of never been put with the Hallelujah diet book.
5,"Excellent gift book, recipes, stories ..","I loved this book so much I bought six for gifts, my mother and my daughters. The stories are wonderful just like her one on one discussions are. I sincerely recommend this book for any Maya Angelou fan."
1,Disappointed,The stories that accompany the recipes are wonderful. They are told in the way only Maya Angelou can enrapture us. The recipes were disappointing. All of the recipes I tried came out bad. Two of my co-workers (one is a culinary genius) had similar results. I'm glad I got the book at the library before wasting my money.
5,In typical Angelou style...,"Every experience I've ever had with Ms. Angelou's work has proven to be captivating, entertaining and above all heart-warming. This book follows her pattern of taking her fascinating real life, and explaining it as though we were sitting chatting over coffee. Although we've never met in person, I feel as though through her stories, we've lived a lifetime of memories together.Again, I couldn't put this book down until I'd read it from cover to cover. The recipies not only are easy to follow, but the stories that accompany them give you a little more insight into the multi-faceted life of a true American icon.I've attempted a few of the recipes with overwhelming success, and highly recommend this book for someone who enjoys the history of regional cuisine. From Stamps, Arkansas to New York City, the food passes all geographic obstacles with ease.I'm so happy to add this to my collection."
5,Maya to the Nth Degree,"Maya Angelou can always be counted on to make you laugh, remember and cry all at the same time. And now she makes you hungry too! You don't have to be able to cook to enjoy the wonderful recipes - just read and follow instructions. Full of love too. This is a great family gift."
4,Do Not Lick the Page!,"Be warned...the photograph of Ms. Angelou's fried chicken will tempt you to do just that. I can't wait to try it...I've never heard of marinating chicken in lemon juice, but if it tastes anywhere near as good as it looks, I can count on blowing my diet.The stories that accompany each group of recipes are warm, honest, and in some cases, hilarious. Her recollections about the ""Presiding Elder"", and how she and her brother hated him, will have you rolling with laughter.This book is worth the purchase price for the stories alone; the recipes are a delicious bonus."
2,Wonderful Writing...Disappointing Recipes,"I was excited to learn that Dr. Angelou had written a cookbook and promptly purchased it. This is a very well written cookbook with stories of her life interspersed between recipes. The photographs are charming. However, the recipes themselves are not up to par. They are in fact, quite awful. For instance, she advises frying chicken in unseasoned flour. She waxes poetic about her grandmother's famed caramel cake, but then provides a recipe for a three layer cake made with only one stick of butter, which resulted in a cake with the texture of cornbread. Her red rice is a travesty against mankind. If this book is truly representative of what Dr. Angelou does in the kitchen, then the sad truth is that she simply cannot cook and has no business writing a cookbook."
4,Mother Maya,"Reading this book of recipes and relating stories made me think of my grandmother. She was a great storyteller and a great cook. For me, ""Hallelujah! The Welcome Table"" had that feeling of home and nostalgia plus it had the added flavor of entertainment (My favorite: ""Good Banana, Bad Timing""). I'm not a regular reader of non-fiction nor am I a cook, but when this book came out a while back, I knew I had to get it for the sake of having it on my bookshelf. While I'll probably never try any of the recipes, many years after Maya has made her home in Heaven, I'll have this wonderful piece of history to call my own. Thanks Mother Maya."
3,"Glorious, but not really a cookbook format","This is a warmly written, beautiful book with very tempting recipes (you almost drool on the pages) -- which are either unique, or have incredibly special touches. Magnificent (like everything the author does). My only quibble (and the reason I didn't give it five stars) is that the descriptions of the recipes and what makes them special appear in a chapter preceding the recipes, rather than above each recipe -- and the recipes are organized by family event, rather than type. That makes it awfully difficult to find anything. But you'll still want the book ... It is glorious, and I can't wait to start trying the tempting recipes."
5,Outstanding Recipes!,"I love cooking-food and a good story to boot. This tome brings them all together with a redolence of days that used to be; I started to recall all the sights and smells of my mothers table and the good times around food we shared.I received this book last Christmas from my oldest daughter. Its my favorite cookbook, but I love my daughter and Angelou too..... Be brave and try the Cassoulet and you'll love this book too...."
4,E.T. The Extra-terrestrial ornament,"I loved this ornament because of the fact that E.T. is in the bike basket. Adorable. The thing that puzzled me was the light at the back. I wanted it to hang on the tree. I will use it with the light, I just have to find a place for it."
1,Negative experience,"I ordered the product the week before Christmas and was told that expedited shipping at $29.95 would ensure timely arrival for a Christmas gift.Having agreed to pay $ 20 more than the product cost at Walmart (because they did not have the size I wanted in the store) I wanted to be sure what ""expedited delivery"" meant.I did not get a reply for a day or two and was then told that the delivery would be in 2 to 3 weeks.I canceled the order and the only thing good about the whole experience is that the vendor refunded my purchase price and Amazon refunded the $ 12 restocking charge that the vendor wanted from me.It was really a case of inadequate representation by the vendor and Amazon of what they meant when they offered ""expedited delivery"""
2,Not what I expected...,Not what I expected from what I heard on link to YouTube. I wanted a LOUD horn for my motorcycle to get other driver's attention when they are too busy TEXTING or too busy fumbling w/ their phone. This was about equal to what I already have. I bought a BadBoy air horn locally and it does the trick.
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars...,Save your money. It is awful and boring and a shame developers even wasted their time on it.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"Nice cover, Slow and shallow plot with horrible voice over effects(I cant beleive someone was actually paid to do voices in monotone!). Controls and camera view are very clumsy and user-unfreindly. What on earth where the developers thinking??? Gabriel Knight was 1000 X's better than this game. I only wish I'd left it on the shelf. PS: I wrote a longer review but I couldnt find it posted, so I shortened this up a bit.Bill Negron AKA AceFreight"
5,Great Game,"The Watchmaker is the best adventure game this year. The fun part was directing the two main characters,among the many characters you meet at the castle. The puzzles were fun to solve. The game also allowed me to play through at my pace, which was a big benefit during the summer time. I would highly recommend this game to adventure players, and gamers looking for an interesting and intriquing story line filled with great game play."
1,Booorrrrinngg,"This is the most boring and chunky game I have encountered. It takes way to long to get things done. The characters don't move as you intend them to. The dialog is so slow you can go fix dinner in the meantime. Having to deal with two characters is ridiculous, you don't know who is supposed to do what. One can do something the other can't, etc. I did not even get through an hour (in game time) before I put it away. Don't even bother."
5,Best Mouse Pad ever!,These are beautiful mouse pads. Excellent quality! I bought my first one about 10 years ago and it still looks new. I recently ordered another one simply because I love the pattern. I have used these for gifts and they never fail to please. I also have some coasters which I recommend. Same great quality and so useful!
5,Love this mouse rug,"I got one of these and my son kept trying to get it. We got him his own and he loves it. It is classy, unique and functional."
1,Not a good mousing surface,"The surface of this pad is like velvet. In my opinion, that's not a good surface for a mousepad. There's just too much friction.I also have an odd aversion to velvet - whenever I stroke anything velvet, it feels like nails on a chalkboard for me. I wish I'd known that this thing was velvety."
4,Ray Charles Is the King of Jazz,"This track is one of the best. Ray Charles really knows how to make a mood. This is deep blues, and I loved every second of it."
1,Cheap Suspension,"Suspension screws on side of helmet stripped out after second use. Your choices with this helmet are to buy this and a new suspension for it, or just buy a Jackson welding helmet for $43.90 which since that's roughly a $6.00 difference, and it's hard to buy a suspension for that amount. Just better to get a Jackson. Plus- a Jackson helmet seems less cheesy all around.Jackson Welding Helmet - HSL2 Passive Lens 14982"
1,Not what I thought it was,I regret this purchase. Thought it was an history of the Great Depression. Discovered it was a economic theory that is little known. Very disappointed.
1,Not about the Great Depression,"If you want to learn more about the Great Depression (as I did) don't buy this book. This book is not about the Great Depression, it is only about some Economics theory. And ONLY about that theory. It is a absolute dry read. I would not recommend this book."
1,"book is built upon false assumption, so goes nowhere","This is a favorite among Libertarians, Classical Liberalists and Regean ""Supply-Siders"". This book is built upon completely false assumptions. How can the Great Depression have been caused by government policy when ALL of the government intervention took place AFTER the GD had already come close to peaking. It is true the tariff act further hurt the economy, but was not the prime factor that accelerated the collapse. FDR never resorted to Keynsianism anyhow until WW2 which finally brought us out of the GD. ..."
1,Popular opinion breeds free market stupidity,"this is one of the most enraging books I have ever read about anything related to economics. The author seems to forget that underneath ALL of the formulas and ""trends"" in any field of economics lies WEALTH. REAL, SUBSTANTIAL, PRODUCTIVE, LABOR-RELATED WEALTH. This is something even Keynesian economists fail in recognizing...any book which does not recognize the intervention of FDR's fiscal policy as a return to the philosophy of our founding fathers (IE. Henry Clay, Alexander Hamilton)and the only way we could have possibly survived the depression and the mobilization to fight fascism is a POORLY written book from an author who is obviously misinformed by the popular trash of classroom and related ivory tower academia."
5,Priceless,"This book is invaluable. Most of the negative reviews are by readers who are either completely misinformed, obviously didn't read the book, or just dismiss it as being ""dry"". The book is filled with cold hard economic facts backed up by a solid theory. So if you are interested in learning the real economics behind the great depression, this is a must read."
5,Definitive work on causes of the Depression,"In ""America's Great Depression"", Professor Rothbard effectively demolishes the myths surrounding this tragic event. However, semi-literate pop-historians continue to ignore the fact that the depression was caused by government intervention. (Central bank manipulation is government intervention.) Rothbard's book stands out due to his refusal to reduce this complex event to a simple story of good (New Dealers, Socialists) versus evil (""capitalism""). Upon close examination of such accounts, it becomes clear that not only do ""historians"" get the facts wrong, they simply fail to comprehend them. Mainstream historians who refuse to even attempt to gain a basic understanding of economics have had their interpretations rendered embarrassingly obsolete by Rothbard."
1,Too technical and too boring,"I wanted to read more about the Great Depression of the 30's so i bought this book.As i started to read it, i realized the book is just too technical and full of words that at least,for me,required i do a little research.Is just too boring because this book reads like a university course from Oxford.I am sure that people well versed in this matter will find it interesting.But i dont think the average person will enjoy it.I was looking for a ""common man"" explanation of the Great Depression and this book is not it"
5,America's Great Depression,The definitive scholarly analysis of why the Great Depression happened and the policy failures which tried to allievate its tragic consequences.This is the seminal volume that launched Rothbard's reputation as the world-class expert on this issue.His subsequent work related to the history of the Federal Reserve and its destructive monetary policy which formented the Depression cemented this important assessment.
2,"Boom and Bust Economics 101, 102, 103, etc.","I picked up this book expecting to read about real people in harrowing circumstances during the Great Depression. Instead, I got a textbook on boom and bust economics that is filled with economic theories and explanations.I would say this book is not for you unless you have a background in economics or wish to start having one. This book is a boring and difficult read for anyone not interested in the pure economic side of the period."
1,This aint real house,"Strictly garbage! tase of chicago my ass! this is a taste of detroit maybe but not chi-town. Too many techno like joints, a couple of house cuts does not make this a house CD. DO NOT BUY"
5,"Tastes Good, not sure if it works for mental clarity",The flavor is good but I don't know if it helps me think more clearly. I do however take a bunch of vitamins already so I may not need it.
4,It's good.,"It's good. I don't drink it too often now, but I think it has a good taste and maybe it is a little stimulating."
3,magic of ice,My name is Greg I read a book call Ice Magic it was about hockey and kid name pie and hell like magic .he though a hockey game was magic. Also what happen in his toy game will happen in pie hockey game .A kid on pie team all ways made fun of him .his team was ok but they lost a of game by one point .at the end of the book the kid that would make fun of hi becomes his friend. I like this book because it about hockey and I like to play hockey.
3,Young Reader Alert,"Dan, 6th grader in MaineMatt Christopher's Ice Magic is about Pie Pennelli and a magic hockey game his friends find in there basement.This is a exciting book that i would recommend to kids 8 to 10. I give this book 3 stars because I think it is for younger readers. It was still a pretty good book to read, but it was a very easy book to read.I would read another one of Matt Christophers books but I would look for a more challenging book from this author."
2,Decent........ Nothing special...,"I just seen this DVD and I figured I'd give it a review.The DVD itself is poorly produced, there is a chapters selection but it don't give chapter titles or anything like they are seperated into in the movie, only pictures that are pretty much useless unless you've memorized the movie inside out.The wrestling on the DVD is ok. Some of it is very talented wrestling and some of it, like most backyard wrestling is extremely sloppy and hard to watch.The DVD also includes a few Whole matches or almost whole matches and these are boring and have no psycology to them at all. If you are a real wrestling fan, don't bother. This isn't for you, or if you re just a fan of backyard wrestling in general this still prolly isn't what you are looking for cvause it is very lackluster.If you want something better and more like a real movie, check out ""The Backyard"".... it is like the Backyard ""Beyond the Mat"" and it is MUCH better then this."
5,One of a kind,"Whether you're planning a retreat or just want to contemplate one, this book is a quiet, smooth-flowing stream of water that will enlighten, inform, and inspire."
3,"Clear, But Limited Information","A great primer for first-timers, but very limited in detail. If you're contemplating ""if"" you should go digital, this book will help you decide. But if you've already made that decison and want to know ""how"" to go about it, don't get this book. It explains the basic MIDI concepts very well, but I was hoping to get insight into what to buy for a small home studio. Although the book tries to give advice in this area, it's quite limited."
5,Great if you need a pick-me-up,"Robert Cummings is hilarious as the bumbling insurance salesman who must -- almost always -- be saved by his girlfriend, the office secretary. I've seen him in serious roles and he does a great job there, but he's amazing as a straight man always getting into jams where he almost, but not quite, loses his job."
3,dissapointing,"Dissapointing. This album is nowhere near as good as ""This Day"" or especially ""Among Them"". I wish someone had reviewed this before me so I would have known that it wasn't that good. I would say that if you really like JBB, then buy this album, although don't expect anything spectacular. If you are just getting into the band buy ""Among Them,"" and then ""This Day."""
5,Honest!,It was great to see an honest portrayal of how Autism impacts a family as a whole and the day to day challenges of raising a child on the spectrum.
5,Gore Galore!,"Not only does this flick feature a kick ass opening music video which accurately parodies 80's hair band music videos, but it's got one of the best head crushing scenes in years and a truly awesome heavy metal monster hero! Easily the best thing Troma has distributed in years other than their own stuff. It's got all the blood, guts, gore and bad comedy one expects in a proper Troma flick but it's also got a special Detroit flair to it!"
4,Surprisingly good,"I am someone with a limited knowledge of music (adult learner for several years on and off) and limited patience for learning simple beginner songs. You can move through the interesting songs in the book pretty rapidly, getting effective practice with obtainable goals. Sure there are plenty of disastrous attempts at humor (like your local standup comedy open mic night), but a line or too is easily overlooked and forgiven."
3,Fake it,I was hoping for more instructional stuff and not just more chords. I guess it was a bit more elementary than what I was expecting. It does have a nice chord section in it though.
4,How to play from a Fake Book,I am a new piano student and have found this book to be very helpful. It makes learning chords both easy and fun. I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn how to do chords on the piano.
2,Fake Fake Book Lessons,"The sample review gives the appearance this book is all about teaching how to use a Fake book to play Keyboard.It begins with a basic simple to understand chapter, but moves fast paced into teaching standard Treble and Base clef just as a typical piano book does. All Fake piano books have treble clef (melody) and the chord (letter) shown above the staff. If you have limited piano skills as I have, this book does not address learning to play keyboard using a fake book and is just filled with typical piano lessons. I would not recommend it for the biginner who want a book that teaches basic improvisation skills on a keyboard (eg: fills etc), moving slowly toward more advanced stuff. This book is far out. If you want early results stay away from this book."
4,Pretty good primer,"I'm already a classical pianist with four years of college training and performances, but wanted to learn more modern playing. I picked this book up at the library. This book pretty much teaches you the chords. The other reviewer who said you are only taught block chords plus melody obviously didn't read the whole book. After you learn the chords, you are instructed on how to split them. I tried another book that starts with the more complicated two handing voicings and could never remember the notes in the chord. This book's approach solved that for me and now I went on to use the other book for the more advanced voicings within a week. I recommend Mark Levine's The Jazz Piano Book in addition to this one"
4,Great way to learn all the chords,"If you're a self-learner who wants a very nice and gentle instruction on all the chord variants, this book is pretty good... it almost feels like you have a good-natured teacher sitting beside you. The book is interspersed with 50+ fake book songs, and comes with a chord reference chart, so it's hard to go wrong for the price.However, it doesn't cover much more than block chords, so if you've learned all the chord variants already (or are going to learn them from the many websites), and don't care for the songs it includes, then this may not be the book for you."
3,not what i needed. piano oriented.,Piano oriented. The theory is good but not what I needed for the guitar.
4,Review of How To Play From a Fake Book,"Just swallow your pride and learn! Looking inside, you might be afraid of what you'll sound like - a beginner - but you're learning something important. Don't be afraid - nobody has to know..."
3,Informative,"I originally reviewed this book with the title informative but annoying citing the humor as being slightly off putting. Now, a couple of years later I find this book quite handy and still have it by my keyboard. I refer to it often when I am trying to play from other fake books and have found the chord charts and explanations quite helpful at this later stage. For anyone who is confused by the fake book phenomenon this would be a good place to start."
1,Waste of money,"If you follow this book to learn how to play from a fake book, all you will end up with is sounding like you are playing a melody on your right hand, and block chords/arpeggios on your left. Not only very amateurish, but sounds downright ugly, and certainly no need for 88 pages to teach you that! You will have more fun and learn more on the way by getting pop sheet music. They all come with piano arrangments and chord symbols. Studying how the pros arrange the harmonies and accompaniments in these pop sheet music will tell you much more than anything this book has to offer. If you are classically trained and don't know what the chord symbols mean, a google search will give you all the answers. And if you don't know how to read music, well, this book won't help you anyway."
3,Which pieces does it include,The description says 5 piece but the picture has more then that. I take its just a general picture but nowhere in the description does it say which pieces you are buying.
1,"Good Therapy For Anders, Bad Read For Us","There's a fine line in memoirs between an insightful look into a person's life that contains meaning for everyone and an exercise that the author's therapist prescribed to them in order to deal with psychological issues. Anders crossed that line with Jubana. It seems pretty clear that she was trying to write a story which portrayed the wackiness that cross-cultural issues can create (sort of a ""My Big Fat Jewish-Cuban Wedding""). Instead, what the reader gets is a manic, unorganized depiction of a woman who was spoiled to the point where she has difficulty dealing with life. Anders probably found some comfort and insight while writing this book. But, the rest of us don't have to spend our money eavesdropping on her therapy session."
1,Lukewarm,"This book started well, but about the time the author enters Sidwell Friends, I was paging ahead to see if it was ever going to be 'dazzling.' Young Gigi is far less interesting and 'cute' than she imagines herself to be.The rendering of all her mother's foul mouthed dialogue into Cubenglish dialect grated after the first couple of chapters.Mami in general seems rude, arrogant, and snobby.I am mystified at the author's identification with all things Cuban. Her grandparents were all Eastern European Jews who immigrated to Cuba in the 1920's, and the entire family left in 1960, when the author was two, so how Cuban are they? Her nostalgia for Cuba seems mostly for the family's lost wealth there rather than the country itself. The author seems far more spoiled JAP than Cuban.Other than a few amusing vignettes and anecdotes, this book is isnt worth the time."
2,Hardly the Best,"Kid Creole has done so much excellent work, even before the release date of this album, that it's strange that he would put together this collection of pretty-goods and near-misses and call it a ""Best of"". A few of the tunes (Lifeboat Party, Don't Take my Coconuts) are great. Several are just plain yawn-inducing boring (Dear Addy, a remix of I'm a Wonderful Thing?). Give this disc a pass and buy ""Kiss Me When the Light Changes"", a disc where every track is excellent."
4,Pretty good,"The Complete Ninjas Handbook is a good expansion to any existing campaign, although it cannot always be used. The best thing in it, is that there are good rules for Martial Arts. So instead of using the material in Combat & Tactics I prefers The Ninjas Martial Arts. A Ninja is truly a dangerous enemy if he chooses the right skills. A expansion on the Spy part of the Ninjas could be used, but thats just a detail."
4,Cool!!!,This is a great book for hardcore ninja fans.The martial arts are great and the class is a lot of fun.
5,this book is great,This book is very interesting just to read and it also has a lot of information on how to play the ninja class... I personally like the section about martial arts. It's very detailed and the system for the martial arts is also very good. This book is worth your money.
4,Pretty handy little book,"Not being able to find an old copy of Oriental Adventures, but wanting to run a Japanese-style campaign (while I was still in the States), I picked this up. While the Ninja class doesn't differ a whole lot from the thief compared to the OA Ninja, the Martial Arts rules, detailed lists of Eastern weapons, and great cultural details were worth buying it. With some historical and mythological knowledge of Japan and this book, I was able to create a pretty decent campaign with this book."
3,Hmmmm...,"The old Oriental Adventures Ninja is much more interesting than most of what is presented here. It gets 3 stars instead of 2 because some of the kits are interesting. Oddly enough, the art, by one of my all-time favorite RPG artists, Jim Holloway, is lackluster. He had dropped from sight for a while, and while I was glad to see him back, I was disappointed in the almost pedestrian artwork. Compare it to any of the stuff he did for AD&D, and in this case for Oriental Adventures modules, and you'll see what I mean."
4,"this is a real good complete hand book, lots o good kits!","I only rate this book 4 stars (instead of five) cause' it's hard to understand some of the ninja's abilities the first find you read it. But, like all the other handbook, it is really good to enter ninja's in your campain. Althought the ninja kinda crushes the thief with he's hyper abilities, if you buy the complete thief's handbook, you'll see, thiefs shall take back their place of honor in your campain!"
3,"Yeah.. worth a read, certainly.","This book is great for story and character source, although i found the game systems for ninja too weak for decent play. Still a great book for expansion on playing oriental characters."
1,Another bad supplement ...,"I will make this review short, everything you will find on this book, can be found in the much more complete D&D oriental adventure gamebook which is much more complete then this bad reprint."
4,Great for toddler vocabulary and early reading,"We've had a lot of fun with these cards. I have no feeling of cramming learning down my kids' throats.I bought these for my 4-year-old in hopes of her learning a few sight words. Instead, my 2-year-old became interested as her vocabulary increased. I can see her pride as she knows the names of all the items. My older daughter is now 5 and loves the challenge of trying to read these, as well as the safety net of having the pictures right on the other side.These are well made in a simple print with nice pictures. There are a few items that are confusing for toddler vocabulary (such as ""cap"" vs ""hat"", ""dog"" vs ""puppy"").In addition to the animals category pictured, there are clothing items, transporation (bus, plane, etc), common objects (ball, book, etc), colors, and shapes. There are also signs (stop sign, exit, etc) which we've always skipped."
1,BEWARE...Did not receive the card set pictured!,I wanted to introduce my toddler to words. I ordered this particular set of cards because it has the pictures and words together on the same side. The cards I received have English and Spanish words for each picture ON THE BACK. This is not what I ordered. I never would have purchased the set of cards I received.
4,detailed coverage of an every growing topic in applied statistics,"The software Lisrel was developed to model and analyze data using structural equation models which involve the introduction of latent variables. Although this topic has historically been most commonly used in the social sciences including psychology and sociology, it is finding a wide range of applications as statisticians encounter more and more problems where it is appropriate to use latent variables.Bollen provides a thorough treatment of the topic that has advanced some since the publication of the book . This is still the best source for a detailed account of the methods. Bengt Meuthen at UCLA was one of the pioneers of the methodology and his books and papers provide good additional sources for the reader who wants to understand the theory and the software tools."
4,"A bit stiff, and a bit dated, but a classic text","This is the definitive textbook on structural equation models with latent varibles. It is a bit dated now, and the treatment is rigorous, but any serious user of LISREL, EQS, etc. should purchase and read this book. For what it's worth, Bollen is not only a good writer, but a great teacher."
4,Mountain highs,"To see the face of Juanita is to be transported back in time, in a way that artifacts alone don't quite do. This story of the combination of scholarship and serendipity that brought her back home from from the peak and into our time is compelling on many levels: Students will read of Reinhard's entry into the explorer's life, and begin to chart their own paths. Those who will never attain 20,000-foot mountaintops will feel the pull of those distant heights, and know their world has been broadened by the experience. Academics will add the information gained from these expeditions to their understanding of the relationship between men and geography. And readers who enjoy a good adventure yarn will have just that, whether at the beach or in front of the fire next winter."
5,Dry humor for the weiner joke masses.,"Mike Nelson of MST3K fame was a better writer than a host. I liked him on MST3K, but he really made an imapct when he was crafting the jokes as opposed to delivering them. Here, we see his brilliant, wry humor in all its glory. This is a rip on every marketing image so sickly sweet that it makes you physically ill. I would recommend you do some Sudokus as well as other brain excercise first: An IQ of 115 or higher is recommended to catch the funniest bits he delivers. That could also explain why my wife lughed harder than I did. Hmm. Back to the Sudoku academy, I guess."
2,Nothing Here!,"Save your money. This book lacks real wit, nor do the pictures give it a boost. The text is not funny, the whole thing looks like it was slapped together quickly. I gave it two stars for the fine grade paper and the idea which was not realized. Buy James Lileks ""Gallery of Regrettable Food"" if you like the notion of razor sharp wit wedded to pictures from bygone times."
2,I just knew it,"I picked it up, unknowing, thumbed through it for a minute or two, and thought ""MST3K."" But without the cleverness.The lethally sweet pictures are cute (ever notice that ""cute"" is a four-letter word?) and added captions funny enough, for the first two pages. Maybe three. Then I started wondering, ""OK, I got that joke - what's next?"" There is no next, just the same joke again and again.At one point I was hospitalized and on heavy painkillers. I tried to watch the Flintstones, but turned it off when I couldn't follow the plot. If you know someone in that state, for medical or recreational reasons, they'll experience all of the book's humor for the first time again and again. They'll love it. That's not me, though, at least not today.-- ww"
3,I was a bit disappointed in this book...................,"The front cover of Happy Kitty Bunny Pony primarily features cute images from days gone by that not only have cuteness going for them but a certain vintage flavor as well. Sadly, only about 1/2 (maybe) of the images are of the type on the cover. To make things worse, I found a huge portion of the images to not be ""a saccharine mouthful of super cute."" The non-cute images were really disppointing given the whole point was supposed to be America's obsession with cuteness. Some of the images look like shoddy paint by numbers as well. I feel if the authors had used actual cute, vintage images from things like old greeting cards, valentines, etc. this would have been a much better showcase. I did enjoy the small amount of images that were cute and of a vintage feel and thought the production quality of the book was good as well. I will say too that the price was right."
1,"Dangerous and incompetent, to give exercises in a book","The author writes about an exercise in this book, the socalled 6-point exercise. This is very thoughtless, incompetent and rather irresponsible, as this particular exercise, as the author should know, needs preparation of a special kind, based on other inner exercises. Otherwise, this exercise can not only lead to wrong results but might even harm. Has the author not read and understood the hint Mr. Gurdjieff gave in the second series?"
3,Author reviews own book,"This book is a memoir - composed of essays and letters written to others about the experience of being in multiple lineages of the Gurdjieff tradition. Since this is a collection of my private correspondence recorded for the time - it doesn't possess the exacting qualities demanded by the outspoken critic below. I am currently working on another book that will have that fierce, undaunted quality. I am not sure that the critic here listed actually read the book - had he done so he would have discovered a secret within that is worth a thousand times the price of this book. Unfortunately he came into my shop with his shopping bag full and had no room to take what was offered to him."
3,Good intro to world mythology,"This is a very nice coffee table book by Peter Clayton. It features many beautiful photos of classical art, and descriptions of the major figures from various world mythologies. This book is NOT by Joseph Campbell, however it does include an excerpt from 'Hero With A Thousand Faces' as an introduction."
5,Anita is Amazing,"THis album is ridiculously amazing! Anita Baker is a living legend. Her voice is so beautiful and unique. If you are a true fan of soul and r&b this CD should be in your collection. Anita is an innovator and many of whats out now is a copy of her style/work. She has a jazz style that no one can touch. My favorite songs are: Rapture, Sweet Love, Angel, and Good Love. Anita, go girl!"
4,The Best of Anita Baker,Anita baker is a living legend and most of the songs on this CD support that fully. There are a few stinkers but her voice is as always flawless throughout...
2,Nothing Special about this one.,I was very disappointed in this CD of Anita Bakers. The sound was very bad and some of the songs I simply did not recognize.I will probably try another one of hers but not soon.
4,The Best of Anita Baker,"Listening to The Best of Anita Baker leaves you with one thing; the need to listen to more. Ms. Baker has many of her best songs snuggly packed into this album including, Giving You The Best That I Got, and by the way, you do get her very best. The Best of Anita Baker is a winner."
3,"Not for die hard fans, but more or less for the casual listener...","For what it is, its a descent introduction for the casual listener or for one first timers.The compliation is incomplete as there is with some(not all)other collections. Firstly, it'smissing ""Soul Inspiration"" which in my book is a really huge hit and great videoand secondly it is not remastered in any way or fashion. In addition, for die hardfans i recommend purchasing the albums so you wont miss a beat.But to you more simplified casual listeners, i'd recommend it as an introduction to Anita and finallygraduate in time with buying her albums to fully be accepting to her naturally graceful voice."
5,NICE,I LOVE ANITA BAKER HOWEVER I COULD NEVER FIND A COLLECTION WITH THE SONGS I LOVE ON ONE CD-THIS SELLER CAME THROUGH ON TOP FOR THIS-I LOVE IT AND THE PRICE WAS AWSOME...HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS TO OTHERS.
3,"It's darn close, but it's just shy of perfect!","Speaking as a person who wore his way through two different CASSETTES of Rapture in my college days, and who owns all of Anita's original albums, I took a VERY CLOSE look at what this album offers and give it pretty high marks. Great track selection, and that they created an edit to that MESS of a run-on song ""Fairytale"", I think is real good. But here's the problem:For some reason they decided to place a great many ""edits"" on this CD. NOW WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT -- there was PLENTY of space for the originals, and most of her songs required no mixing, editing or what-not.All this, PLUS, the album lacks: Album 2 (Rapture) / Side A (Back when we had such things) / Track 4 ""Been So Long"" --->""Been so long"" is a required track. Without it, you don't have all the Ms. Baker has to offer. Heck, I think I'm gonna play it right now. :>I'd buy this album, but I wouldn't use it as a reason not to own the Rapture album."
3,Body And Soul,"It has been almost twenty years since Anita Baker made it on the scene with The Songstress. Now, her legacy of R&B has finally a collection of its own.The 2002 album, The Best Of Anita Baker is a showcase of 18 of Anita's most loved songs, from all five of Anita's albums: The Songstress, Rhythm Of Love, Compositions, Rapture, and Giving You The Best That I Got. Each song reflects beauty and elegance, with a dash of the old school R&B that many radio stations continue to overlook today. The album also includes mega-hits like Body & Soul, Sweet Love, Fairy Tales, plus her Grammy winning song, I Apologize.Although the album is pretty fair, many of the songs were compressed down to single versions, rather than the full versions from Anita Baker's albums. Still, some other songs could've been on this album, like When You Love Someone from the Billy Crystal film, Forget Paris, and Perfect Love Affair. Nonetheless, it is a pretty decent greatest hits album."
3,"Fantastic voice and songs, but a weak ""best of""","Anita Baker has one of the best female voices out there, and she has put it to great use throughout her career. If you like R&B/soul at all, you will love some of these songs. But if you look at the distribution of songs on this collection across her 5 albums, you will see a pattern that is not accidental: 5 great songs from Rapture (her 1st); 4 hit-or-miss songs from Giving You the Best that I've Got (2nd); only 5 songs combined from the final 3 albums; and a few forgettable non-album tracks mixed in. ""Best Of"" is worth getting, but I would start with Rapture first -- its 8 tracks make up one of those rare consistently excellent albums and are a more enjoyable listen than this mixed-bag collection."
4,"Totally Worth Buying, But Missing 1 Great Hit","Anita Baker is one of the best R&B singers of all time, and this is a great CD. But my favorite Anita Baker song is not include, and only available on The Final Frontier, Mad About You CD. Anita kills the theme song, Final Frontier. Maybe it will be included in the next greatest hits CD."
4,Vintage Anita!!!,"Eventhough Anita Baker has been away so long, this Rhino compilation does provide relief for Anita Baker fans, new and old. Although this CD is missing ""Been So Long"", which is from her sublime 1986 ""Rapture"" album, it still provides a supreme listening experience. This CD contains serious highlights from each album and does great justice in its selections. It represents the fine choices in adult contemporary and soul ballads that was made very popular by Anita Baker during the 80s and 90s. Every song is a gem and continually proves why she will always be a Diva, forever."
5,Timeless Classic Set of songs!,"Anita baker..one of the best. Her music is beautiful, relaxing, soothing and quite positive."
5,amazing cd,complete collection of songs is a must have anita shall maintain entertain with her heavenly voice that ispired us in the 80s and 90s wont regret amaxing cd
5,"fantastic music, great price","One of a very few artists who consistently produces great music. All tracks are good though I would have preferred the extended version of ""fairytales"""
5,The Girl Can Sang,"Anita can sang. She has the kind of voice that makes you want to cuddle up to your lover and have some serious .... She puts into words all the emotions that go along with love. Her song, ""I Apologize"" has been my anthem when I take things out on my boyfriend when he's not the one I'm mad at. I love almost every song on this CD. I even discovered a couple I hadn't heard before. Buy the CD and get you some good loving tonight."
3,Anita Deserves At Least 2 Discs.,"This is a healthy, but incomplete collection. For starters, the inclusion of 'single edit versions' is a complete insult and injustice to anyone who already owns the original LP's. Secondly, the song selections leave a lot to be desired, where's ""Been So Long""?, ""Mystery""? and ""I Just Wanna Be Your Girl"" her classic first single with Chapter 8? Another disc of studio material and some prime live recordings (she's never issued a 'live' set before) would truly represent her best. This is okay for novices, but dedicated fans deserve better."
4,Excellent condition but slower response,Item arrived in excellent condition but it took over a week. A CD ordered at the same time but mailed from a competitor arrived within 3 days.
5,Nice,This CD was great. Not one song on that CD didn't bring back memories. This one is good to have in the collection.
4,The Moaning ...,"that's what keeps this cd from being 5 stars. I just can't listen to it wall to wall. I remember my mom playing Anita's ""Fairy Tales"" when I was a wee toddler and I hated Anita Baker's voice. Since then I have come to appreciate her music. ""Angel"", ""Sweet Love"", ""Caught Up In The Rapture"" and ""Body And Soul"" are my favorites. For some reason I just lack the fortitude to listen to her voice after ""Giving You the Best That I Got"", I have to take a 20 minute break and then finish the cd. She has a great voice but it just starts to wear me down after a while. That's just me though, go out and pick it up, it's well worth it."
5,Well over due. Awaiting patiently for new inspirations !,"Anita's songs never grow old or boring ...every note is heartfelt and a true inspiration to anyone who listens. I often tell people to be quiet while she's playing because I feel they aren't listening to the words. Her vocal style is truly emotional and literally gives me chills every time. I judge an artist by their ability to make me feel and Anita does just that. I remember buying the songtress and saying wow ! That lead to raptue and so on ...she has yet to fail in my expectations of a singer. An yet, she's a mom, a wife and she continues to make her fans happy. I only hope she releases something new for us !Can't wait Anita ! Love to ya !"
4,Anita Gives You The Best That She's Got!!!,"Anita gives you the best that she's got here! All of her hits and then some. My particuliar favorites are Fairy Tales, Talk To Me, and Sweet Love. Their aren't any bad songs here. A wonderful compilation!!!"
4,for those who don't have the collection,"I've got all albums by Anita Baker and this one is the one that I will always have in my car. For it was hard to carry the 5 of them, all the times. There is no perfect ""Best Of"" for all the songs are great. But for those that have never bought a single Anita's album, this one is the one to start with."
1,I want the old Pamela Morsi back,"I've been disappointed by her shift from historical romances to comtemporary fiction.I love her older books, which make me laugh and cry no matter how many times i've read them.To dear ms. morsi, please go back to your former writing style. I miss that literary voice."
3,A good read.,"It takes cancer to reunite a long shattered family. Dawn Leland always felt as if her in-laws saw her as not good enough to be married to their son, so after his tragic death, she took her two little girls and left. Now, stricken by a deadly disease, she takes them back to their father's family so Sierra and Dakota can be cared for as she battles for her life. Through flashbacks, readers learn how they arrived at this point, seeing the happier times in contrast to the present forward struggle.*** At first blush, this book could be a truly depressing one. Cancer and death have a plethora of emotions that Ms. Morsi has captured perfectly, yet there is a thread of hope that emerges that will be comforting to the all too many people out there who are intimately familiar with this scenario. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer."
1,Who is writing Pamela Morsi's books? Certainly not Ms Morsi,"All I can say is I am SO VERY disappointed in the recent books of Ms Morsi. I, like Mitiz who wrote a review 2/6/05, used to buy ANYTHING Ms Morsi would write, w/o reading the back of the book or any reviews. I was confident they would be delicious. Not any more. I totally agree with Mitizi's review. I can't express it any better, she says it all. When Ms Morsi returns to writing her books, instead of this unknown person who has written her books for the past 4 years, I will, once again, buy anything w/ her name on it. Please bring her back soon, I miss her moving, down to earth, characters you hate to see their story end. Her contemporary books leave me cold. I will be more discerning."
4,101 Frequently asked questions about homosexuality,Good godly answers for today. I learned a lot from someone with experience that will help my family deal with issues we had no knowledge about. Thank you!
1,Absolutely Disgusted,"Title says it all. This book is majorly offensive and promotes a primitive hatred of things most people refuse to understand. Don't waste your time, or money, on this book."
1,Denial isn't just a river in Egypt,"When my eye caught this book in the Christianity section of a local book store I picked it up and leafed thru it. I was disgusted. How narrowed-minded and alienated and just totally in denial are some Christians? This makes homosexuality seem like a bad thing. Content goes something like this: ""Our son is gay. What should we do? Where did we go wrong? What is the best 'process' for getting him back?"" The author is a back-in-the-closet homosexual who obviously rejects his true self. Depending on how you take it, this book can make you laugh or shake with anger(it's both stupid and horrible). When I put the book back on a shelf I placed it in the history section -- between Mein Kampf and a book about Hitler's SS & The Order Of The Deathhead. This other books about overcoming homosexual urges are just wastes of paper and ink."
2,Tasty but pricey,"I remember Charles Chips from my childhood and was anxious for the tin to arrive. I was disappointed. The tin was as advertised but the amount of chips in the tin was less than expected. I expected the big tins, not a tiny tin. The amount of chips was about the same as a very large bag of chips from the grocery store costing about 1/7 of the price. The chips were good and not too salty, just as I remember Charles Chips tasting, but it costs too much for what you get. At least the tin is reusable."
1,racial explotation,why would a cover with a black man and white woman be so desirable? racial brainwashing continues...............
3,Flexible Shower Door Sweep,"I bought this to replace the door sweep on my older shower door because the information online indicated it would fit most older style drip rail systems. It stated the product is 1.5"" and that is exactly what the one measured that I needed to replace. This new one is only 1.4375"" and that is critical because of the design of my rails. It took some time but I managed to make it work. I just hope it stays in place because I do not want to glue it."
2,More remixes...,"Do people really care about all the remixes? I mean, there are so many! This single has three parts to it just to make room for all of them. I mean, seriously.It's a good song, but enough with the remixes."
1,"Poor design, open flame on igniter","It is a very nice looking grill and looks great on my deck, and that is about all it is good for. I have only two requirements for a grill, it should start up and cook food. Due to a design flaw that Weber refuses to acknowledge, it's ability to start is short lived. This is due to the burner tube which has a series of large holes that feed gas into a chamber that houses the igniter so that the grill can quickly light. The problem is that once the grill is lit, those large holes release the largest amount of gas which generates the largest flames and the most heat - right onto the igniter. Any replacement igniters do not last long. I expect much better from a grill that I spent $1,000 on."
2,Stainless Steel ?,"I bought this grill sight unseen and agree I should have done more research. I bought the stainless version, or at least the version advertized as stainless (S-420). Basically everything weber doesn't show you on their web site is not stainless.. The entire frame, back of the lid, internal drop pans etc.. are all regular coated metal. I was really disapointed to see this coming from a company like weber.I don't think I can post a picture on Amazon, but I have posted one on other reviews. Its almost funny what this grill looks like from the back.If you want an all stainless grill, you will need to look elsewhere."
1,WARNING! Don't buy a Weber. Horrible leaking in the body of Weber Grille and customer service is RUDE! Do your Homework,"I do not know why people give this product ANY stars... I did not want to, but Amazon website forced me to give it at least one star. Would you like to clean up a combination of grease and water overflowing from the grease pan after a rain? No retrofit? Weber's only solution is that you Have to MAKE SURE you cover the grille. Well, it started to rain during our grilling... and the grease pan overflowed and made a real MESS! Please do your homework and review Weber online. Their customer service is not only ridiculous ""you have to make sure the cover is on"", but also very rude and sarcastic when I sent an email. It would be a very long time before I would buy another Weber (yes, I had one for 14 years and loved it). Their Summit Series is significantly flawed, or maybe their whole line is flawed."
2,Summit Line Has Problem,"The Weber Summit line of grills have a design flaw that Weber refuses to consider an issue. Whenever it rains, water runs down the back and enters the internal drip tray, and empties into a drip pan. The pan then overflows the greasy mess onto the cabinet floor. Furthermore, the drip pan cannot be easily removed without almost totally spilling the greasy mess."
2,Weber Summit Design Flaw,"This Weber Summit grill, as well as the entire Summit line has a design flaw that Weber refuses to consider an issue. Whenever it rains, water runs down the back and enters the internal drip tray, then flows into a drip pan, which then overflows a greasy water mess onto the cabinet floor. This problem occurs with and without the Weber Premium cover in place. (The cover has a mesh on the back that lets the rain in.)I give the grill a two star rating because it does do a nice job of cooking ... once the mess is cleaned up."
3,Nero Fiddles,"I picked this up as I'm big on on Roman history and liked McCullough's and Saylor's fictional treatments. The premise was interesting, that Nero really didn't commit suicide, a look alike slave is killed and mistaken for Nero. We follow Nero and a ferret faced greek who speaks Cockney around Sicly, Italy and Rome making many hair raising escapes from death, capture etc.The protagonist's meeting with Seneca early in the book sets the stage for various Philospohical musing over the course of the book, and we also get a reassessment of Nero as an emperor, musician and human being.The problem is that this is all covered by about half way through the book, then the escapes and philosophical musings become repetitive and boring. I got tired of the wisecracking cockney/greek guy and found myself skipping over most of the rest of the book to the last chapter just to get it over with.McCullough's and Saylor's book are superior to this in character development, plot developlment etc."
4,every got damn time i turn around,"Mr. Brown is clearly a connisseur of the finer things in life. He is clearly a true artist, sacrificing anything that is frivolous and fanciful in the name of his art's benefit. Read this book, get the box set, and follow Mr. Brown's career forever."
4,Twelve Angry Men,"Black and white film (left that way, thankfully) that still stands up. Tight script with great actors, many of whom went on to other impressive roles. Love to get the opportunity to see this as a play. I know it's been produced in many venues!"
3,Love the movie but...,The quality of this dvd leaves a lot to be desired. There are lots of extras on the 2 disk set but for it supposedly to have been remastered I could get a better copy of TCM.
5,Bad day at work? Let these guys vent for ya!,"Forget today's special effects, big explosions and easy to swallow dialog. For an hour and a half we are drawn in to a heated argument over a young boys life. 12 terrific screen and stage actors duke it out to determine his guilt or innocence. Henry Fonda's role as the lone man who stands up for what he believes in is almost overshadowed by a powerful performance by a angst driven Lee J. Cobb. Terrific performances by E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman and Ed Begley make this a must have for classic movie buffs. The show is carried in one room by some of the best. Two thumbs baby!"
5,Great video for enhancing your critical thinking skills,This video demonstrates great examples of critical thinking in a crisis situation. You will not regret when you have seen it. It is one of the greatest video that makes you think and it is fun to watch!
1,Ruthlessly absurd,"This film's stupid! They spend all day in that room, to be deceived by a maverick, and come to highly disproportionate and illogical conclusions!If this film is in anyway a representation of real life jury process then I would be slightly frightened.My vote is 1."
5,One of the Best Movies,"The first time I saw this movie, I was hooked, and every time it comes on tv, I do my best to watch it. You have this young Hispanic boy who is accused of killing his father. He doesn't have the best background,and they are asking for the death penalty for this young guy,and when the jury goes in to deliberate,you have eleven men willing to convict,but one who doesn't wish to convict.The arguments brought out and the things that the jurors forgot about,yet remembered when in deliberation makes you wonder how some people judge without really looking at ALL the evidence. What a great film."
5,A Classic Among Classics,"Ok, you have 12 guys that spend the entire movies huddled in a small jury discussion room and do nothing but talk for 90 min. How is that interesting? Let me tell you, the first time I watched this movie, I was riveted. The casting director should have won an Oscar for how well he crafted this ensemble. Every one of these 12 are wonderful actors and take their parts very seriously. Henry Fonda is obviously the star of the movie, but he by no means carries the movie - Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley and the others are all co-equals and add the necessary spice that moves this movie one that could be watched over and over again. It was recently on TCM and although I've seen it probably half a dozen times, know most of the lines, and what's going to happen, I was glued to my seat for that whole 90 min. I just can't get enough of it!"
2,Didn't work,"I had to watch this film for a graduate course I was taking, but once I bought it I was unable to view it on my computer. I think it was an error on my computer...something with my flash player."
5,One of my 5 favorites of all time,"This movie is just terrific. The acting, the story, everything. I think it's a perfect illustration of how today's movies have come to rely on special effects at the expense of everything else. All the action in this masterpiece takes place in one room! Lee J. Cobb is amazing, and Henry Fonday is great. We have 12 distinct personalities here, and each one is developed - the thoughtful, courageous man of conscience, the bigot, the decent working class types, the shallow advertising executive, etc. Watch it, you won't be disappointed."
3,Good... Not Great,"If you want to see a movie that frames social injustice, and leaves you feeling like there is still hope for humanity, then watch The Power of One, Hotel Rwanda or Driving Miss Daisy. 12 Angry men is dated and does not live up to today's standards."
3,Ridiculous court room flick,"Yes, the acting and the filming were good. But the story! Oh, come on. This is flim flam from the Henry Fonda Left in the 1950s. A jury, badly divided and often in heated argument, votes to free a young man who obviously (by all the facts, including an eye witness) killed his father. The only hold-out turns out to be a psycho. Get it? These poor slum kids, no one ever gives them a break. This melodramatic potboiler was remade in 1997 to include a woman judge and a black defendant. Get it? Or is this too subtle?A waste of time that insults one's intelligence."
1,DVD Busted,"This DVD arrived before expected, but it is not viewable. The disc skips from the start. The menu is not accessible - The DVD is broken."
4,Twelve Awesome Men!,"I bought this film for my classroom after reading the screenplay. The moving deliberation allows students an inside look at serving on a jury. The chaotic and racially charged environment that the twelve men develop throughout the deliberation process sheds light on key jury vocabulary such as reasonable doubt, premeditated homicide, and hung jury. Although the film is in black and white, and some of the lines and characters have been slightly changed, this is a great adaptation of Reginald Rose's masterpiece."
4,A True Classic,"This is a great movie. It's title gives away what it is about, but the pace of this film is what is truly amazing. Yes, the majority of this film flows by in near 'real time.' In other words, this movie draws you right in by making you feel like you are there for every second of the deliberation.The DVD itself is good, but there aren't many special features. The movie itself is more than special enough though."
5,GREAT FILM!,12 Angry Men!This film is a classic in every sense of the word.What a cast!You have to see this film.It should be required watching!
5,GREAT CLASSIC MOVIE,ANOTHER MOVIE THAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR ALL MOVIE LOVERS. ANOTHER MOVIE THAT I HIGHLY RERCOMMEND. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PROFANITY AND ALL THE OTHER JUNK IN TODAYS MOVIES
5,12 Angry Men,A must see movie that is based completely on persuasion and assumptions. In my top ten movies of all time. Whoever wrote the script was a genius!
5,Oldie but goodie! Awesome,"If you are part of a criminal justice program or even law school, this film is a must! This movie really makes you think about the truth, the evidence and how personalities and ulterior motives factor in a decision in the jury room. A must to see even if you are not in school!"
5,a big classic and one of the best management training,All the other review made are correct about this master piece. In addition to all the plaisir you get in enjoying a great film it it as well one of the most effective managment training I ever got. How do you manage to get in a meeting room and change the mind of all the people around you and bring them to your point of view ? All the best techniques are in this film. Just enjoy and learn at the same time!
3,Great film but not a Region 1 release,"I received this DVD in good condition and even though it was a requirement for a class enjoyed watching it. However, when I attempted to play it on my regular Media Center it stated that it is not formatted for Region 1 (US and Canada). I was able to play it on another DVD player I have but this is the 2nd time I've received a DVD from amazon that was not intended for the United States. Susan"
3,I liked the later version better!,"I hardly recognized Henry Fonda, he was so young. This is the 'Classic' edition and is good. If you don't watch it first, (prior to the later remake) you won't enjoy it as well for what it meant in its time. The later version with Jack Lemon, George C. Scott, & James Gandolphi, is more compelling for today's audience. This later version has two black men on the jury and the racial strife involved in the case is more compelling. i watched this version first, and then found it difficult to get absorbed into the earlier classic."
3,A Glaring Omission!,"I have used this magnificent film ever so often to teach the basic concepts of social psychology to enthusiastic college students. If ever a classic film deserved a special edition DVD, this IS the one. I am still in shock that such a glaring omission has occurred, and the studio should address this mis-calculation. If ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""High Noon"" can be graced with such an elevated status, why not this matchless piece of acting genius?"
3,Suffers a bit by comparison,"I am happy to have this (with Robert Cummings as Juror #7) version of this excellent play. It is technically well done and the DVD print is fine. I have owned and watched the Henry Fonda film of ""12 Angry Men"" over the years and the TV version reaffirms how critical Fonda's performance was to the earlier production. (Cummings is OK but he lacks the bite that Fonda has). The rest of the cast is enjoyable in both versions. I have a small personal take on the play, having worked in an amateur production of the show years ago, with a mixed men-and-women cast and titled ""12 Angry People."" (A woman played #7.) It, too, was well received, which confirms that the play is inherently a fine drama."
5,Great movie!,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and unfortunately one that probably wouldn't happen today. No special effects, just incredible writing and great acting!"
5,The art of persuasion at it's finest.,I was assigned to watch this film for a class discussion involving non profit management. The professor assigned it because it illustrated quite adeptly the fine art of persuasion. The ability of one man (Fonda) to change their guilty vote to one of not guilty was impressive to say the least. It taught me s great deal regarding patience and watchfulness regarding negotiation. Would recommend it highly to any student who needs to learn the intricate nuances of the fine art of persuasion.
5,An answer to a Q or two,"A Giant of a Film!!! To add to the general knowledge - the film was filmed primarily on location at the Bronx County Couthouse in NYC - and one of the little secrets Lumet used was to gradually move the walls in on the jurors during the course of the film, dramatically heightening the claustrophobic effect!! (Did I just mix a metaphor???)The ensemble cast - truly outstanding. Not to be missed - and to be discussed. This is a timeproof reflection of the frailities of us all."
5,An American classic,"""Twelve Angry Men"" is a simple story. 12 male jurors deliberate on whether a young man is guilty of murdering his father. 11 jurors initially believe the man is guilty, and one does not. As the film progresses, more deliberation gradually convinces the others the man isn't guilty. The acting is superb, truly superb, starting with Henry Fonda as the lone juror against all the others, and the lesser known actors are equally strong like Jack Klugman, and Martin Balsam. Lee J. Cobb gives the best performance in the film as the angry, resentful juror who slowly breaks down. This is a classic American film and I think anyone will appreciate it."
5,Goes great with the play.,It is wonderful to use when teaching the play 12 Angry Men. Some of the play has been changed but not enough that it really hurts it. Would like to see the updated version on DVD.
5,ToK with 12 Angry Men,"I used this movie in my Theory of Knowledge class the last 3 class period. It is so ""ToKish""! Guess you would have to be in the IB program in school to understand how it relates to everything that we have talked about and done the past year and a half. My kids loved the movie! Their papers that they wrote about the movie were wonderful!"
4,Most clever!,"I think I lost parts of this movie because it's very hard to stop our VCR at exactly the right place...but I enjoyed it none the less! What appealed to me was the intricacy and cleverness of the way each piece of 'evidence' was dissected and proved false. There was an interesting range of characters and I loved the claustrophobic setting - so simple yet so effective! I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in courtroom procedures or social psychology, anyone who enjoys mysteries/detective novels, and anyone who likes movies set in the 50s (that is when this is set, right? ^_^)"
2,Great Movie but Disappointed with product,"I purchased this movie for my 18 year old son, I was happy that he was interested in a classic movie. I received the movie in a timely manner, however the movie will not play properly. I wanted to exchange this movie for another copy of the same but to my disappointment I was informed that I will not able to exchange it for another copy, so I do not know what to do, My son really likes this movie and would love to be able to view it without it glitching continuously. No offense against the movie, just apparently this specific copy."
3,Mediocre,"This film gets three stars for great acting, a reasonably good script and great filming, thus making for pretty good entertainment. It loses two stars for substance. Wouldn't one expect that there would have been some discussion of who else might have done it? Did the old man have any enemies? Did he owe anybody money? Was there anything missing from the apartment indicating that robbery may have been the motive? Was there a sign of forced entry? Certainly, before voting not guilty there should have been some discussion of what else may have happened. In the face of strong direct and circumstantial evidence they produced a not guilty verdict because the male witness ""might"" have wanted to get his name in the paper and the female witness ""might"" have forgotten to put her glasses on. (Perhaps reading glasses caused the indentations on the bridge of the woman's nose.) Verdict: Good on entertainment, bad on substance."
1,Amazing film-crappy dvd,"Is anyone else sick of of great movies being ""double-dipped"" on Dvd? They first come out with a bare bones edition on dvd, and then a little later they come out with a ""special edition"" dvd with only a couple extra features on it and then charge you more..like this dvd. Do you think this is all the supplemental materials that exist for this film? I seriously doubt it. Great film, lousy dvd."
5,Remarkable... a great find,"I was not familiar with either Vector Lovers or the Soma label before I was introduced to this CD by a friend. I do truly enjoy emotional electronica that has a cinematic sweep to it, especially artist albums from Bola and the Black Dog. I was amazed at how good this is... rarely can you find electro to be this touching. I guess I was expecting another series of bland acid-house riffs based on the cover art, and I was caught totally off guard. Don't pass this one up if you find it!"
2,a coming of age novel?,"If I had the choice, I wouldn't read this book. Unfortunately, our A/S Level Literature class had to do this -terrible- book that is apparently, a work of literary art.Martha is depicted to be a self absorbed adolescent who is 'struggling' to come to terms with her self discovery. She is also coming to terms with herself as a sexual being. She is somehow, meant to represent all seventeen year old girls out there with her self indulgent views on the world. Her arrogance and pride, meant to be some of her 'positive' points, grate on the nerves. Martha, as a character reeks of unnaturalness, a pity as the story rests upon her.The only redeeming factor, in my opinion, is Lessings description of the natural beauty of South Africa and her depiction of the simmering racial tensions in the veld. The era of World War Two and the legacy of World War One perhaps, created a world which my generation could not relate to. Or at least, I could not."
3,Magnetic - Lo Culture,"David Harrow delivers some harder-edged drum `n' bass and breaks. Lo Culture, his second release under his Magnetic guise, skips the jazziness of James Hardway and the pure techno of Technova. Instead, we have tracks like ""Doggydaddy"" which is all drums and low synth sounds, and ""Shackled"" with a techy jump-up feel. ""Trailerpark"" has some warmer tones running through it, as does ""Scared Sacred,"" but darker tracks, like the slower but moodier ""Weight Up,"" make up the majority of the album. While it's certainly competent, it doesn't have the edge to distinguish it from others of its ilk. Still, though, it's a good listen."
5,Raiders Rock,"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas, because he is a die hard raiders fan..and a board game junkie.It was the perfect gift and its really fun. The collectors pieces really made him happy."
3,whats all that noise?,"The pinion gears on the grinder sound as if they are not set properly.Even with no load on the unit, the (90 Degree angle) gears sound just awful.I like everything else about the grinder but I don't think the gears will lastvery long. So I retuerned it for full credit and bought the Milwaukee Grinder."
5,Bejewelled 2,This is a very intertaining game. It has several areas of interest and works well for any age!
1,Won't work on Windows XP Media Addition,I read this game was very addicting and really fun. I bought it for my husband for his birthday. We can't get it to load on Windows XP Media Addition! Happy birthday. :( Good luck getting it to run on your computer it sounds like it would be a fun game to play.
5,Fun and addicting!,"I like this game a lot. It has different variations that include timed games and endless games. If you have a new computer set up the better resolution and faster acceleration... you get the cool ""wormhole"" transition between the worlds!Be forewarned, though. This game is simple and easy, but challenging and highly addictive! I wanted to play a 'couple' of games and wound up killing an hour!"
2,"slow, slow, slow",game will start running slow at about level 3. tried contacting the company. I sent them data about my computer system and no response. tried the game on 2 computers and the same results.Bejeweled 2
4,Sure to give you a well-earned headache,"Bejeweled has been one of my personal favorite computer games of all time.It challenges you the moment you start (even if you don't realize).The puzzles are fun, until you beat them all.However just like every other game, this one is sure to get old after constant abuse."
5,This is a really cool game,"I downloaded this game a few weeks ago. After using up the trial time it suddenly hit me... I should buy this game. So i did. And let me tell you... It feels phonominal. This game is so great. Simple, but great. There are 4 ways to play this game. They all have a cretain twist to them. I prefer classic mode cause i am a classy guy. HAHAHAH. anyway. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes switching jewls around, or who likes good animation and killer sound effects."
1,This game is fun...when it works,"This game is indeed as much fun as most reviewers indicate -- when it works. For us, the game started to crash the computer after about ten minutes, then would not work again unless we reinstalled it.We contacted PopCap games (a small nightmare; there's no provision for customer service on their webpage, and I had to search for a direct line to their offices), and they advised us that it was probably a bad CD-ROM. They sent us a new one, and now the game only crashes every ten minutes; we don't have to reinstall it.I'd highly recommend this to folks who only have ten minutes to spare to play; otherwise, it's too frustrating to put up with."
3,Even For The Old at Heart,"At 74 years of age playing this game might seem a little silly....However it provides a great deal of intense focus for an old man and keeps him on his toes, both mentally and phyically, at least the eyeballs really keep working. It usually takes me several games to get warmed up and than I can build up a sizeable point count."
4,Fun Little Game,"Don't misunderstand me when I say I play this game to help me get sleepy. It's both stimulating and relaxing. If you play the Action game, as I do, you have to concentrate, so it takes your mind off of everything else, thus, relaxing. The sound effects are particularly cool too. I like it a lot."
3,Good Game Bad CD,Bejeweled 2: DeluxeI want to tell you that this game is fun to play but the CD is terrible. Every day that you want to play the game it shuts down your computer and you have to re-boot. You then have to uninstall and reinstall the game to get it running. I put up with that for a week and then tossed it in the trash. So if you have $14.99 + tax to throw away buy this game. Fair warning...good luck.
4,Addictive game,"It is a very simple addictive game! you will play for hours saying ""Just one more time""!"
4,Quick PC Entertainment,This is an old classic with some optional neat variations in play. I bought this game for my laptop to play when I'm on the road as it doesn't require a lot of graphics. Plus I can stop it anytime and it is easy to play with a bit of a challenge.I am again so happy with Amazon.com and NothingButSoftware.com for the rapid efficient delivery & service they provided.
5,Addictive,Bejeweled 2 can't stop playing and it is just as addictive to grown-ups like me. So many levels and so many facets. I warn you when you play his game be prepared for hours because you just can't STOP!! Somebody help me stop!!!!! hahahha
5,Fun and addictive!,A great game to pass the time away. Just be careful not to start this game while cooking dinner. You'll get so involved with the game that the dinner may burn to a crisp!
4,good,"i was thrilled with the video game, but i was dissapointed with the graphics in between each stage, the rainbow worm in-between is missing after each level. i was looking forward to it."
5,Endless fun and chalenge!,"This is a much better version of this already great game! It provides four different options for playing! We have gotten past the 100 level on the Endless game. And we are still going. Definitely recomend, anyone can play this even if they are not pc familiar. My mom is a new pc user and is addicted to this game!!!"
5,DON'T MISS THIS ONE !!,"JUST BUY IT. THIS REALLY IS A GREAT GAME, AND YOU'LL NEVER TIRE OF IT. IT IS WORTH THE PRICE. L.H., WHEATLAND, CALIFORNIA."
3,Bejeweled 2,"This was purchased for a gift to my spouse, so I do not use it. She is satisfied with it."
5,Land of opportunity!,"While Wade Cook is primarily known for his savvy investment strategies, Wade is also a keen thinker with a positive mental mindset. He believes in America and wants to make everyone of the opportunities available only in America.America is in indeed the land of opportunity where everyone cane reah the stars, if only they will step up on their toes just a little bit."
5,Very Motivational - Excellent book!,YES--The American Dream is alive and well and only in America can anyone live out there dreams.Everyoe is just a diamnd in the rough if only they will stick out their necks and go for it.Great book.
4,"Crazy World, oh, full of contradictions...",This is a CD to enjoy in a saturday night at your home with a cup of wine and singing along and alone. Thinking of a very special person.
4,Good reed,"I am an older musician, trying to regain skills I ""once had"" yearssssssss ago. This reed works well for me. So does the Rico Royal 2 1/2. They are both made by the same company. They both work well with the Selmer mouthpiece I have."
3,"Bravo, Mr. England","Col Hackworth is absolutely a brave soldier. But to be perfectly clear, he does NOT write his own books and never has. Every review here comments on the eloquence of this book. Those accolades properly belong to Eilhys England."
2,A real disappointment,"COL Hackworth is a real hero who continues to do an heroic job in all his endeavors except writing. After the GREAT ""About Face"" Hackworth hasn't quite recaptured his ability to tell an intelligent story nor teach a lesson intelligibly. I was really disappointed in this book...it is written for teenagers and war groupies, rather than soldiers and/or historians hoping to learn something (other than catchy cliches and snappy comebacks...and a few new ways to swear) from this soldier's vast experience."
4,Hackworth Knew What He Was Doing,"Hackworth definitely had the right strategy in mind. His tactics were superior to those of most commanders in Vietnam, and it's unfortunate that they weren't more widely used by the Army. Hackworth proved the VC could be beat in battle and ultimately destroyed using superior firepower and encirclement tactics, as well as geurilla tactics against the geurillas themselves. The book also provided good descriptions of everyday life in Vietnam. It also showed what poor leadership and bad decision making on the part of commanding officers can do to the morale and effectiveness of regular troops. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is Hackworth's unjustifiable hating of all officers and his likewise worshiping of enlisted men. This is not only apparent throughout the book, but in his opinion collumns as well. That said, I highly recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn more about operations in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War."
4,"Well written, could of been a 5 Star.","A very good account of what happened in the Mekong Delta. Not something that I wanted to relive, but a story that needed telling. Hack did it well. You either love him or hate him.The only reason it didn't get a 5 star is personal."
5,Another great book by Hack!,"This book should be required reading by all troop commanders. Leading troops is not a popularity contest and troops respect those who respect them. Proud to have served in support of Hack with C Trp, 7/1 Cav."
5,"A ""must read"" for all Vietnam vets!!","I served as a platoon leader and company XO with a different battalion. This is the first of Col. Hackworth's books I have read. He did an outstanding job. This is very clearly and well written. He doesn't pull any punches. He points out what his predecessors did wrong, and he backs that up with the results he got. Much more importantly, he kept his casualties to a minimum.Too bad we didn't have more Col. Hackworths. It might have meant a different result? Read this one."
3,typical good but not great power metal,"This is a good album but nothing that jumped out at me too much. Like one of the above reviewers said this has a good mixture of darker material mixed with some freedom call type choruses and riffs, but it works pretty good.This album suffers from many pitfalls of most power metal bands nowadays, the largest being an abundance of average songs, nothing terrible but nothing extraordinary. I also can't get with one of the above reviewers talking about great lyrics, the only lyrics that really jumped out at me were the cheesey kind.The Devil and The Red Rose are two really good songs.This is by no means a bad album but there is much better out there."
5,"Well written and inspirational, I read it in one sitting.","As a suffer of AIDS, my life has new meaning since I was told that I am HIV positive. I want to simplify my life. Donna Friess' book has given me courage and a new insight into making my life count. It is my most valuable possesssion."
5,Cherry flavor with a hint of sour.,"These candies are very good. They have a nice cherry flavor with just a little bit of sour thrown in. Most sour candies made these days make your eyes water and your mouth pucker. Not these gummi's, they have just enough of a sour taste to make them interesting but the sour taste is very very mild.My order came in great condition and very fresh."
3,Not sour,"Not sour as some of the other reviewers have stated. I for one could not really taste any sour bits, but it's a fine gummi candy on it's own. Sugar coated, etc. Just wish it was sour, or at least Hairbo made a 'proper' sour gummi candy."
2,bummer dude,"i got this bag as part of the TWO bag ""special"", dont like how they rope you into buying two bags to get the Free shipping. making it $28 all together! these cherries are NOT at ALL Sour! Big Bummer! Even worse was that every single one of them in this 5 pound bag were BROKEN. none of them were in one piece, the stem connected to the cherry. i used them for Valentine favors, and they were NOT cute like the raspberries, because they were in parts. the non-saur part was the Big let down. they may have come broken because they were shipped in the Dead of winter. tho they did not sit outside for one second. so not sure if they always come broken. i will NOT be getting these again."
3,"Gummi yes, sour? not exactly.","If you're looking for sour, you're unfortunately not going to find it here. This however, does not mean the product doesn't taste good. There is a faint flavor of grapefruit in the gummi itself which I assume is where the sour tries to come from. It's definitely chewy and just enough sweet to cover it without being overbearing. It's recommended as a tasty chewy treat, but it will not satisfy sour fans who're looking for a kick in the saliva glands."
4,Not as sour as expected,"As other reviewers have stated, these are not very sour. They are coated in sugar with the gummi being the actual sour part. I did enjoy them at least."
1,"Too Sweet, Not Sour at all","These are way too sweet. I'm a huge fan of Haribo Gold Bears, but this was a real let down. Large chrystals of sugar overwhelm, with no trace of sour.yuck"
3,"Tasty, but not really sour","I ordered these because I was once an exchange student in Sweden and one of my favorite gummi candies over there were these sour cherries. They were two cherries on a stem and sour! I got there and they were tasty (and being Haribo--Swedish) but not very sour. I sucked on the candies for awhile and once the sugary coating was off the gummy inside was more sour, but still the wrong candies. I guess I'll have to wait until I get back to my beloved Sweden. :-("
2,Not So Sour,"Haribo Sour Cherries were disappointing.I expected them to be ""Sour- Tasting"" &they were not. I would not buy them again."
3,Beware: NOT the sour cherries from tangfastic!!!!,"If you've ever had the Haribo Tangfastics and are looking for the Sour Cherries from it, these are NOT them! I have had the tangfastics, and the sour cherries in UK, and these are a different cherry! They taste more watermelony to me, and are not sour at all! If you have no expectations then they are pretty good though."
3,Haribo Sour Cherries,"Bought this candy to try it as a fill in snack. Much too sugary. The cherry flavor is ok. The bag is HUGE. So it's good if you have a lot of kids to eat them. They advertise a five pound bag, it certainly is a five pound bag. Too sweet for me, but ok."
3,Nice treat but one whole sour cherry is too much...,"I LOVE sour candy, so I thought I'd try these.The Haribo Sour Cherries are really good, and can last quite a while in yourmouth if you can refrain from chewing them up!However, I find that you have to chew off either the leaf or the cherryto have an amount to eat that is the right size. Eating a wholesour cherry is too much at once!YUM!"
4,Must own CD for fans of nothern classical music,"I purchased this CD as soon as it came out. Although I recommend the first CD (Symphonies 1,2,3) for those just getting started with this composer, this CD is a valuable addition to fans. This music sounds more simple than it actually is, but has complex texture, and shape.Great recording."
5,Great Offer for a real racket,"I don't usually belive in items that are on sale, mostly because I've been scam a couple of times.This time I was broke and needed a good racket for de cash that i had....it's a offer that has satisfied me."
5,Nice Racquet,"Great product, fast service. Check grip size by hand and measurements prior to opening. I enjoy playing with this racquet. Midwest Sports went above and beyond in service."
4,Gracefull,"Excellent product...I'm gonna buy a extra raquet!! I recommend it if you wanna hit the ball the way I like..strong.Rgds,JOrge"
4,Great Racquet,"This Racquet was great buy and I am glad I did it. For me, it was perfect weight and I instantly saw an improvement in my game. I find it easy generate spin, hit hard shots, not overshoot the court or hit it right in the net. One thing I think this racquet does better than any other I have ever seen or played with is that I am able to hit it with reckless abandon when my contact point is high like between my chest and shoulder. I am easily able to position my shots on the court. My only minor complaint is that it is a little top heavy and when you get really tired you can't generate as much head speed."
5,Excelente raqueta de tenis !,"He comprado esta raqueta por su relacion precio/producto. es una de las raquetas mas usadas de los ultimos tiempos, y que haya bajado de precio la hace mas interesante aun.Posee una relacion de cuerdas de 18*20, lo que la hace mucho mas precisa y controlable. Tiene un aro 98 midplus, excelente tamaño para jugadores intermedios a avanzados.Estuve en dudas de comprar la Instinct o la Radical, y me decidi por esta ultima, debido a lo anteriormente comentado.100% recomendable, tanto la raqueta como este vendedor.Saludos desde Santa Fe - Argentina!"
2,Not for younger children,"I bought this DVD for my third-grade twins who are having difficulty memorizing math facts, and don't quite understand the relation between these math facts and the real world. I thought this DVD would be perfect, explaining basic math facts with humor and real life examples. But their explanations are way over the heads of this age group. In explaining the concept of ""carrying over"" while adding, for instance, here is what is said and written out on the screen: ""Carrying over means you take the digit in the tensplace of the digit place sum, and carry over that digit to the next digit place to the left in your addition problem. You do this whenever the sum amount in the digit place is greater than nine.""Yeah, *I* get it, but it is not the simplest way to present it to an elementary grade child.I'm not certain what grade level this series is for -- perhaps middle school and above? -- but definitely not for those just starting out."
1,"Poor teaching, waste of money","Standard Deviants DVD's are the Best made only if they are the 2001 or older ones not these new ones that are updated 2005 and up. It looks like the Goldhil Educational bought out Standard Deviants and changed every thing that was good with the old DVD's and change the way you buy them, they cut them up into smaller DVD's so you can buy just what math learning you want like addition or just fractions, or you can buy the full DVD like this one.Don't wast you time and money, keep looking for the old version onesThe new ones have little teaching and poor skits, poor humor."
5,Life-changing? I'd say so.,"I love learning. And with this text, a LOT of learning occurred (in my class, Sociology of Deviance, at an esteemed public university. I'm stil learning from it. I am especially glad that this text is available on all the e-devices, too.P.S. This book helped me work through a major depressive episode - it brought on a personal revelation, if you will. I just hope that it serves you well, too :)."
2,Works but flimsy,"They work and the price is right, but out of the 8 I bought I will have to return 1 due to the slider not wanting to slide very easily. I have other sliders from Phoenix Gold and these seem like they are more likely to fall apart after time. Also, upon closer examination it looks like the transformers and PC board were made in a cheap Chinese factory. That is not to say there are not great manufacturers in China, I just think that this was not made at one of them. I will keep my fingers crossed but I am not hopeful."
1,ghost stories with soldiers,"I think this was supposed to be a special-purpose anthology - military fiction for sci-fi and fantasy readers. What I read was an anthology of ghost stories (horror genre) that happened to have a military setting. There was little of the science fiction flavor and less credible military behavior. I found many of the stories populated with wooden and stereotypical characters. Darned few characters behaved the way soldiers in any of my units did. I'm sure there were a few good stories mixed in this book, but they were overwhelmed by the bad ones."
4,Soccer Skills:Soccer Fun At Home With Tips!,"Continued soccer fun with drills that create polished skills.As a followup to CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER DRILLS, this at home programdoes a great job promoting good soccer drills with key techniques attached!"
4,Great video,Really learned alot from this video as I myself never played soccer and have a U10 boys team I coach. We are playing better than ever and the boys have really enjoyed the drills they have been taught!
5,Soccer Coaching:Valuable Soccer Drills & Skills!,"As my kids say, this DVD is the ""bomb"".We keep watching BACKYARD SOCCER DRILLSover and over then take a break and go outside and practice.Very well done!"
4,Soccer Fun At Home With Great Instruction!,"Some very relevant soccer drills combined withstimulating instruction. The positive results of this video (DVD) have beenconfirmed with my own kids. If one looks beyond the drills offered in this video,you can create your own with the ideas given.This dynamic soccer video should be viewed by youth players as well asthe competitive travel team player. Improvement is almost a guaranteebut you have to practice! This is recommended!Soccer coaches & parents also liked this DVD set comprised of six programs.Soccer Coaching:Schupak's Soccer 6 Pack DVD Set"
2,Two wods:Don't buy.This video sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,There where only 5 good things: 1:Taka-vs-Chtistian 2:Mankind-vs-Ken Shamrock 3:X-Pac-vs-D'lo Brown 4:The Undertaker entrance 5:McMahon fires Austin
1,Giving Judgement Day 1 Star Is Too High of a Rating,"After viewing Judgement Day for about an hour or so, I thought the Pay Per View event would turn out to be amazing in the end. I was sadly mistaken. All the matches were very predictable, and Kane vs. Undertaker for the title, with Austin as the ref? What kind of main event is that? DO NOT PURCHASE this video, save your money for King of The Ring or Over The Edge"
4,Excellent Show!,This Judgement Day show was excellent...Most of the matches were entertaining and people who gave these matches bad heat are just marks for Goldberg...they actually believe he's Infinity-0...Christian vs. Taka Michinoku was the best match on the card...X-Pac vs. D-Lo was excellent and the main event was decent...it was indeed better than WrestleMania 14! Worth the money...
4,Stone Cold's last dance???,WWF Judgment Day was a first when the WWF decided to put an unprecedented 5 titles on the line. You get to see WWF Light Heavyweight Champion-Taka Michinoku defend his title against Christian. The Headbangers challenge the New Age Outlaws for the WWF Tag Team Titles. X-Pac tries to regain the WWF European Title from D-Lo Brown. WWF Intercontinental Champion-Ken Shamrock goes up against Mankind. The main event picks up where WWF Breakdown left off. The vacant WWF Championship is on the line between brothers. The Undertaker vs. Kane with former WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special referee. The ending will shock you as Mr. Vince McMahon proves to Stone Cold Steve Austin that he has the brass to fire your a$$.
2,Judgment Day 1998,"This video si very good. I like many matches, it is :Eorupan Champ X-Pac vs D'lo Brown Winner is: X-pacKen Shamrock vs Mankind The Winner is:Ken ShamrockChristian vs Taka Michionoku in Lightweight Championship The Winner is: ChristianMark Henry vs Rocky Maivia The Winner is: Mark HenryUndertaker vs Kane The Special Guest Referre Steve Austin The WWF CHamp The Winner is: fought in a no contestGoldust vs Val Venis The Winner is: GoldustMarc Mero vs Al Snow The Winner is: Al Snow because this match is interferred by........."
3,not that great,This event doesnt really have much to offer. The whole night you were just wondering if austin was going to get fired or not. The marc mero/al snow match was pretty lame 4/10. Goldust vs.venis was average 5/10. the new age outlaws vs. headbangers was pretty good 7/10. Mankind vs. shamrock was good 8/10. The rock vs. mark henery match was crap 4/10. The undertaker vs.kane with austin as referee was good but not great. I give it about a 8 1/2-10. I would only rent this video.
1,B O R I N G!,"This was a truly boring PPV. I can't see why some of you people actually liked this video. It was so darn boring that I nearly fell asleep watching it. The only part in this video worth seeing is at the end when all the fans are chanting ***hole at Mr. McMahon and Austin gets on the mic and says: ""I can't hear a word your saying because you have got 18,000 people calling you an ***hole""! That was funny. Then, McMahon fires Austin as Judgment Day went off the air.DON'T BUY THIS SNOOZEFEST. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY."
3,KHAN RISES TO THE OCCASION - YET AGAIN,"A good place to start if unfamiliar with THE VOICE, aka Chaka Khan.Highlights of this album are the incredible (Grammy-winning) Night in Tunisia (And the Melody Still Lingers On) where Khan literally soars. A very funky re-thinking of the Beatles' ""We Can Work It Out"" gets things pumping, while the tailor-made title track is a fun-filled jam that recalls that warm summer romance kind of feeling. On ""Night Moods"" Khan shows a surprisingly deep mellow side and her duet with her brother Mark Stevens' on ""We Got Each Other"" makes you wonder why this song was not a huge dance floor hit.Overall, a good show case for Khan's multi-faceted vocal prowess.KDP"
5,Chaka Reigns Supreme As Goddess Of Fire,"Chaka Khan came back again with What Cha Gonna Do For Me as a followup to Naughty. I must say that when I first bought this on vinyl, I was very disappointed. But after I bought this on cd, I was pretty amazed at how beautifully orchestrated it is. Every song is a gem to remember. I love the title track which was written by Hamish Stuart who was part of American White Band. But as far as the undiscovered gems, I would say that Night Mood is one of my faves due to it's inherent heat of melody. I enjoy dark sensual songs and it fits the bill. Now as far as Mr Man that said that he particularly doesn't like Chaka, but loves Anthony Jackson, well Mr. Man needs to write a review on Him instead of Mrs. Khan. Chaka was the REAL show stealer, not some contrabass player. If you don't like her, that's one thing, but don't commit blasphemy on Chaka. Learn to write on Mr. Jackson! Thank U! Grade for Chaka: A+! Grade for Anthony Jackson: F!"
5,"...to me, CK can do no wrong...","....wall ta wall cutz, CK's patented Circe seduction, tight production from Mardin, et al, and the sheer brilliance of ""A Night In Tunisia"" redux with Gillespie. The album is a great pleasure even if you ain't a Chakaholic. By the way, check out Sean Davis'(the reviewer below) Chaka webpage. I have and I must say, it's a MUST BROWSE if for nothing else to peruse them great CK photos..."
5,Chaka Is In Rare Form Here!,"Chaka shows some of her versatility here, and standard R&B with jazz are done well.Her vocals are maturing by now, and she uses her skills well by mingling with the horn section, or just by working WITH her musicians."
5,A Stellar Album from Chaka!,"While each of Chaka's albums all have their own unique appeal for me, this one is absolutely my favorite. This more than any other was a true tour de force of Chaka and her producer Arif Mardin. It is hard to truly categorize this album as to a particular musical type, as there is such an infusion of styles going on here. This to me is also the album where Chaka highlights her love of jazz. ""Nights In Tunisia"" is amazing, and the stellar ""I Know You, I Live You"" is nothing short of perfect. I recently purchased a DVD of Chaka performing these songs live in concert back in 1981, and she is breathtaking! Her version of the Beatles ""We Can Work It Out"" turns this song into a high energy affair of vocal gymnastics. To be honest, every cut on this album is great. A must have whether you are a fan or just interested in getting to know her music better!! I can't speak highly enough about it."
4,really moves,"The Beatle tune, ""We Can Work It Out"", I would describe as being the most unusal super funky arrangement of this song I have ever heard. It made me jump up, clap my hands & start dancing. Other tracks really moved too. If you like Chaka Khan, this is a must for your collection along with the ""I Feel For You"" CD!"
2,Must Love Power Rock Ballads,"If you answer yes to the statement above... this may be worth a listen. This is my first experience with Shadow Gallery and, unfortunately, it doesn't peak my curiosity to check out any of their other discs.The musicians are talented, the engineering great, some instrumental passages are outstanding (""Manhunt"", ""The Archer of Ben Salem"", ""Room V""), and so what's my problem, you ask? Many of the songs are mediocre at best (""Comfort Me"", ""Torn"", ""Encrypted""), the backing vocals remind me of corny 90's power rock ballads, and the most notable issue are the weak melodies, almost comical at times.The standard edition does not list the band members or what they play, who produced or recorded it, special thanks, etc. This is the only disc I own without liner notes!"
5,Awesome as Usual!!!!,"What can I say - Shadow Gallery is a band to be reckoned with. Their powerful music and melodious lyrics and harmonies equal the perfect equation for a great album! And that's what you get here - a great album. I've been a loyal Shadow Gallery fan for 10 years now, and I can't get enough! I have all their side projects each member has been involved with (and not just because I know each member personally) - They truly are up on top the pedastal of Progressive Rock and they will remain there as a testament to their legacy of great music! Kepp on rockin' guys!!"
3,"Room for improvement, with a view","These guys do the symphonic metal better then many of their European companions, incorporating a better production flow and use of lead guitar to even many of the overbearing elements that make much of the genre sink. But it still has plenty of fallback cliche moments to keep the mood from being continuously curious. Those opposed to the more melodic, less crunch driven approach might not appreciate its Dream Theater-isms, but the openness only allows for a broader approach, if one that still needs refining to make lasting impacts."
2,Vocals need work. Fairly Bland Melodies.,"Looking at the reviews here for the album I thought I'd give it a chance and ordered it. For me at least that was a mistake. I'm wouldn't call myself a huge prog-metal fan, but I do like good music when I hear it, and this is definetally not that good. Bands that come to mind in the game gendre would be Symphony X, Evergrey or Therion. Although they have the same style in common the one thing they have that this band does not is catchy tunes and engaging vocals. What Room V has to offer is rehashed prog-metal with bland non-interesting vocals that seem to me belong more in a high school play. If you can't get enough prog-metal then this one's for you. All others should stay away and get your prog fix from better sources. Unless you like uninspired lyrics like ""And now you've gone away, I've begged you baby, please don't go away""...yuck."
5,Tank Pressure Checker,I purchased this pressure checker so that I could check the pressure in my tanks instead of having to hook up my regulators. This product is quality made and very easy to use to accuratly check the pressure of your dive tanks.
3,Not A Bad Deal,"This is a nice little printer that works fine with Windows . . . it is quite slow as is typical of most inkjet printers and the graphics capabilities are limited. The main gripe I have with it is that it only works with Windows but is useless for UNIX or Linux since there are no drivers available to get the OS to be able to communicate with the printer. Still, for most homes or PC setups, it should be adeqaute. It's quite hard to beat the price at any rate."
3,average,"I got this printer a while back so i've definatly had enough time to test it. It prints pictures VERY VERY slow and when it finally comes out after what seems like years there are tiny little lines that run across the picture, plus it is very loud. When i printed out a picture of Yosemite that i took there was snow on the mountains and when it came out there were tiny spots of red that the printer had added that weren't part of my origanal.recommend: people who are desprate for a printer.rating out of ten: 4 1/2"
1,Save your Money,I got this printer with my first computer. It prints desect quality. But about a month later it started printing itemsoff and cuting off. Then about 3 months later it just quit working. if youn want a printer don't get a Lexmark get an H.P.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"I cannot stand this product! I got it in a package with my computer. I was dissappointed! It did not come with the needed cables or cartridges! Then, each cartridge cost 41 dollars! It is a rip-off! I've paid for this product at least seven times over.. It is just not worth it... Get an HP!"
1,Unbelievably Awful,"One of the worst books I've ever read all the way through to the end--and I only kept reading to see if it could really get worse (it can, and does).Heppner uses lazy, predictable, wooden, pedestrian prose. Whoever at Publisher's Weekly said his prose is ""axe-sharp"" should be fired. This is a novel which requires no work whatsoever on the part of the reader (well, maybe only to stifle laughter at Heppner's terrible sentences and dialogue), uses no imagination, and would be utterly forgettable if it wasn't so unbelievably awful.It's supposedly satire but it's not funny, it's supposedly literary but contains no artistry whatsoever. The Egg Code showed some promise, which is how I unfortunately got suckered into buying Pike's Folly. I won't be fooled again. This feels like something Heppner wrote in twenty minutes to fulfill a book contract. This is a work of fiction which is utterly without merit. Don't waste your time or money."
1,boring - bland - bad,"Heppner's first, bloated novel, ""The Egg Code,"" was critically well-received but, on its own, a knockoff of everything trite and tedious you might come across in a graduate-school writing program. Toss in a bit of Powers, a dash of Wallace, some Barthian hyperbole, some Pynchonian futurizing--blah, blah, blah--and you have ""The Egg Code,"" one of the worst books ever written, despite the gargantuan advance and ""postmodern"" preening of its author.Now, Heppner's back...and worse than before. If that's possible. ""Pike's Folly"" is a skeleton of a book: poorly written, blandly plotted. At least the book has one purpose: it's now supporting me left-leaning toilet. Thank you, Mr. Heppner, for writing such a ""useful"" book."
5,Very Interesting,"I'm doing research on the hope of writing a romance novel based on a story my ex-husband told me about how his grandfather came to America. I found this book fascinating. It gave me a real feel for the time and the place. And unlike many history books, it wasn't boring."
2,Wayyyy Overpriced! Beware.,"Just picked this up in the 99c Store the other day! If you want one, try the local clearance aisle as opposed to this overinflated item."
3,Could be easier to use.,"Being a big fan of the arcade game, I was surprised to see this as a handheld. I wish they could've used a ball instead of the joystick. The joystick doesn't work that well. Don't think I'd buy another game like this."
3,Too full of himself,"While I found the book interesting, based on his tale one would think Mr. Psaltis is the world's best undiscovered chef - maybe he is but wouldn't be nice if he left it to the diner to discover this instead of force feeding it to us."
1,"subtitle "" I cook for the rich""",With a brother in publishing does that explain how such a dull read was published?Some name dropping and various gossip but not much of how/why the 10 year old became a 'world class' seasoned chef.....I got an advanced review copy and to make it even less interesting there were no photos!Not much of an autobiography!!!!
5,From a professional Cook.,"This book is really the most entertaining for industry professionals, or people who are interested in the inner workings of the restaurant business. There is no talk about specific dishes really, or recipes, or taste profiles. This is the story of one cooks rise from the bottom of the kitchen, to the top of it. Its a very candid and entertaining ride that many cooks go through, including me. Any professional cook can relate to this book and will be glued to it. Most people don't understand the type of dedication required to cook at this level, and ones who have read about, don't seem to believe it. But Chef Psaltis' story is wonderfully executed, and is a true enjoyment. To see the journey of a Chef, buy this book, if you're looking for food facts, don't."
2,Reads like a dictated pseudo-memoir,"Doug Psaltis's twin brother is in the book biz, which might explain how such thin material got published. Can see it: ""Sit down, Doug, and talk to the tape recorder; we'll fix it later."" They transcribed it but they didn't fix it. You learn the name of every cook in every kitchen but nothing about the taste of the food. And nothing at all about what Doug learned (techniques? flavors? recipes?). With no professional training except what he picks up on the job, he hangs on to become chef de cuisine in one of Alain Ducasse's kitchens. So? Brilliant? Lucky? Or did he just keep showing up? You come away from this dreadfully boring book with no sense at all of what makes Doug special, and you might be right in suspecting there's nothing special at all."
4,An Insider's View of Some Major Kitchens,"This short, light book seems to give real insight into the life of a cook in a fancy restaurant. It's clear that success in this field requires dedication of one's life, not to say fanaticism, to the preparation of top-class food. The co-author is clearly consumed, body and soul, with the best preparation of good food. Along the way he meets others in his occupation who work hard but leave the life to go on to something more reasonable by way of making a living. For foodies like me this is helpful stuff in understanding the milieu I love to frequent."
2,Boring reading!,"I truly enjoy reading books on food and other writings from chefs. Many of these manage to convey not only atmosphere, but also the genuine love that professionals in the culinary industry have for food. Unfortunately this book does not convey any love of cuisine to the reader. I have read books by Michael Ruhlman, Bill Buford and others, and this book comes nowhere near the quality fo those simply because of it's lack of feeling. For all the emotion Mr Psaltis manages to convey, he might as well have been writing a book on computer programming. I am not asking for 'food porn' of any sort, but this book seems to be very soulless, and in the end comes out as quite boring reading. The author seems to have a very high opinion of himself, and not in a self-effacing manner either."
5,I loved mine,I had one of these when I was little with this video. A lot of times I would watch it without the white thing with the buttons and I still loved it!
4,A good anime.,"This was a good anime to watch. It has a good storyline, the downside is that it stops at season 2."
5,New focus,I bought this and another product to encourage new habits in my goal for optimum female health .... arrived quickly.
4,"Works well, but has somewhat flimsy construction","It works quite fine, installation is easy, and it has done its job for 2 years at my house despite somewhat flimsy construction.It has one design defect for which I took off one star: when fully screwed in, the ""nipple"" is not centered, so the water jet is aimed at my right bum cheek!! I had to unscrew it a little bit to center it, but the unscrewing leaves a small gap through which water drips down into the bowl: very slowly, maybe one drop per 20 seconds, but still somewhat annoying.Totally worth it despite the design defect, and I am very happy to have bought it."
1,Very poor quality,"I am a fairly good handy man, just installed an under sink water heater plumbing and electrial with no problem. This has poor directions. I custom fit the seat with no trouble but the plastic fittings are of very poor quality could not fit without some small leaks. I would not recommend this to even a good handy person. It is in a bag ready to go out to the trash. Thank goodness it was only $40."
1,Stay Away,"This album sounds like the early stages of the Projekcts, a very bad early version of it. When the album came out, it was a logical thing to do to buy this album. But today, nobody should even think of buying this . If you already own the Projekcts 1 2 3 and 4 , listen to them again and stay away from this one"
1,Improvised to Annoyance,"I love King Crimson. That said, this release is one of the hardest to listen since Starless & Bible Black. It is just TOO FAR out there and is to the point that it is actually annoying to listen to. Contrast this release to Discipline, one of my favorites, where every song is meaningful, forceful and knows where it is going. This release wonders through the notes like a drunken student at a college frat party."
3,It is interesting to say the least.,"This is the King Crimson cd that will divide most fans right down the middle. Totally improvised and recorded on tour, Thrakattak is probably the most unique instrumental cd I have ever heard. I love it when bands take risks, and most bands would not have the guts to put out a cd that was totally improvised on stage. King Crimson are so far ahead of their time it isn't even funny. For crazy unrelenting instrumental music fans only."
1,Unlistenable,"I am a big prog nerd and a big Crimson fan. But the stuff here (one would be hard pressed to call it music) is an unending continuous racket that will induce nothing but a pounding headache in the listener within a very few minutes. Calling it ""aimless noodling"" would be unnecessarily kind. Avoid this at all costs, even if you are a fan of the recent Crimson. I can listen to Albert Ayler and Sun Ra at their most extreme, but this dreadful mess is totally irrelevant to any kind of ""music"" whatsoever. [...]I've been a Fripp/Crimson fan for many, many years and believe him to be an absolute genius, but this CD is totally unlistenable earsplitting racket."
1,Worse Album Ever Recorded,I am a huge King Crimson fan and I have almost every recording the ever did. I believe they are geniuses and man for man as powerful a line-up that has ever recorded. This is noise and garbage that goes nowhere fast and continues for 60+ agonizing minutes. I recommend Absent Lovers Live in Montreal 1984 if you want live King Crimson...Absent Lovers - Live in Montreal 1984
2,Sonik Mess,"If one enjoys the cacophony of an orchestra or a rock band warming up before a perfomance, one will have fun listening to this live disc. The tracks are ""improvisations"" taken from the band's tour of the United States and Japan in 1995. The question that begs to be asked is why was this material released? After all, the one improvisation worth of note""Thrak"" has already been featured twice on the band's other live album B'BOOM: AN OFFICIAL BOOTLEG LIVE IN ARGENTINA 1994. The liner notes to the compact disc answer that King Crimson could release THRAKATTAK on the band's own label(Discipline Global Mobile) because profit-driven major labels would not allow the band to act on its ""wilder impulses"". The major labels might be right, some impulses are meant to be ignored."
5,Good calendar,"My husband has the books. He really enjoyed getting the calendar for his office. Some of the pictures are so beautiful, I thought about framing some. Two thumbs up!"
1,LAME,"Do not buy this book. Unless you need to be able to laugh about your inability to ""talk dirty"" with your partner. This book was a complete and total waste of time and money."
4,Get Out Your Bookmarks,"Bonnie Gabriel has offered up a varied and practical guide in this book for getting started with erotic talk. I appreciated the many angles presented, as from experience, I've learned that people feel comfortable speaking erotically in very different ways. Surprise chapter headings such as Negotiating Safe Sex-Erotically, and Sensual Words That Nurture and Heal, or Words to Leave Your Lover Wanting More caused me to skip around as my interest moved me. I also found myself dog-earring some of the wonderful stories from her years of doing workshops.There are lists of words, exercises to try and situations offered up for compassionate consideration. She urges the readers to put themselves in the place of the person who will be hearing what you have to say. I loved that there was plenty of consideration for changing desires and concerns of couples in different stages of relationships. A very useful book."
5,The best of it's kind,I have never seen or read a book that is more to my liking in terms of the overall approach to so many different issues. It is professionally done and at the same time enticing. There is so much that I have been missing in what I can bring to an intimate relationship and Ms. Gabriel has shown the way clearly.
2,Ho hum,"As an adult, I thought this book would have given me something to think about. No way. It's written for a novice, right out of the starting gate."
1,NOPE!!!!!,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK DID NOT HAVE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I WAS LOOKING FOR PHRASES TO SAY TO MY MAN TO TURN HIM ON. IF YOU ASK ME , I AM ALREADY THE EXPERT AT EXOTIC TALK. I WAS NOT LOOKING FOR STORIES OR HER EXPERIENCES. I RETURNED THE BOOK. ALTHOUGH I LOST THE SHIPPING COST, IT WAS WORTH THE LOST AND RECEIVING A REFUND OF $7.? AND SOME CHANGE. I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
5,"Candid, practical, and warm. A unique erotic approach.","The author's convincing premise is that romance and sexual pleasure depend on our imagination, and the imagination is fired by our verbal as well as our physical caresses.The unique thing about this book is the focus on how we use words to make love. For a small book, the coverage is remarkably comprehensive, yet it is informal, very candid, and warm, not cold and clinical. ""The Fine Art of Erotic Talk"" covers such diverse elements as vocal qualities, speaking rhythm, word selection, different contexts for using erotic language, and how language relates to different variations of sexual games.The result of this remarkable scope is a highly unique self-development program for erotic communication and improving sexual pleasure. This is one that will delight the budding romantic in just about anyone"
1,Waste of time to read.,This book is not very interesting and does not explain anything worth reading. It is a collection of short stories.
3,"Great Book, but...","I found this to be a great text with very clear description of creating a good argument. However, I want to warn potential buyers that the copy I received was a truncated, abridged version of the original text. This version only has chapters 1-6 and the introduction. It is missing some of the vital ""fallacies"" that appear at the end of the book and also the additional appendices for ""attacking faulty reasoning."" It is the ""Riverside Community College"" edition of the original text, so be forewarned."
4,Practice Safe Reasoning,"As a college logic teacher, I recommend this book. I divide my course into two major areas: formal and informal. Damer's book is perfect for the informal section. I find students are weary after learning about syllogisms (and ""Barbara Celarent""). Informal arguments are much more common, and this book addresses 60 of the most common errors. The book is suitably brief for class use, with plenty of exercises to reinforce the detection and correction of the errors. After reading this book, watching political debates will never be the same!"
1,Missing pages,Book was in tge condition promised except it was missing pages. Didn't find out until later. Make sure when you're buying textbooks that you check for that
2,Coverage Does Not Match Its Introduction,"The Introduction says see the sample answers and explanations at the end of the text. They don't exist. The Introduction cites definitions for specific fallacies like Tu Quoque, Fallacy of Popular Wisdom, and Inference from a Name or Description that do not exist in the text.The Fourth Chapter ends with a table of 60 fallacies, however 35 of the fallacies are not defined or further discussed in the text.The fallacies and definitions that do get covered are covered pretty well.All this for $35! What a rip off!"
2,Misleading Postin,This posting ledge to purchase a book that was only had selected chapters from the full book. Now I have a book that is not complete.
3,Attacking Faulty Reasoning,"This is a common college text for debate courses. However, I read it to prep for my interest in being a better advocate on social issues. I think the book works well for either uses.Attacking Faulty Reasoning: A Practical Guide to Fallacy-Free Arguments"
1,Misleading,Purchased book and realized when received that it's the wrong edition. The edition was not displayed and I purchased the wrong one now. When logging back in I couldn't get any information on the editions for this book. Bad buy n now I'm stuck with this purchase.
3,A bit of a letdown...,"I bought this book to assist with planning for a trip to the Mt. Pisgah region.POSITIVES: The writing was in a fairly entertaining style, and the trail descriptions and maps had lots of details.NEGATIVES: There was no flow in the Mt. Pisgah section--the trails weren't arranged in sequence, neither by location nor by difficulty. Also, there were precious little recommendations for newbie flatlanders such as my son and I. The author seemed more interested in reporting his own experiences than in considering the needs of all his potential readers.The book's OK, but I would only recommend it as an adjunct to the excellent ""Western NC: Pisgah"" book by Jim Parham."
5,Great trail guide. Great stories.,"This is a biased review: I rode some of these trails with Timm while he was putting together the book. The book does a great job of communicating the care and enthusiasm he brought to the project (well, care in trail mapping - there were some impressive biffs). This book not only has a great selection of trails, but it's a fun read. By far the best guide to trails in North Carolina."
3,What was the point of this movie?,"Lots of 80's ""B"" movies coming out on DVD. You will see pigs fly before this one ever does. Really, what a strange and pointless movie. Last time I saw this was on a midnight movie back in the late 90's. Ummm, it's got Louie Anderson in it. Here is an idea it could be remade, and Tim Burton could direct it! I could see that happening. Now, Frog Dreaming (also called ""The Quest"") is a movie that needs to come out on DVD before this one does."
1,Sensory Overload!!!!!!,"I will not say this is a good movie but, few good movies are as entertaining.Robert Townsend actually gives a good performance but, the real highlight here is the Ratboy himself.Designed and built by oscar winner Rick Baker.No tail on Ratboy.Rats!A game that might serve to enhance your Ratboy experience if thats possible.Try to imagine Clint Eastwood's reaction when chum Sandra Locke shows it to him for the first time."
5,The Classic Account,"Runciman's is the classic account of the Crusades, and one of the finest works of history published in this century. Those reviews who found it dry must have been weaned on Mitchener, Rutherfurd or other such pap, and those who regret the omission of consideration of crackpot conspiracy theories within (some of which had not been written when H.C. was published) will, of course, remain unsatified."
1,A great example of why people dislike history,"I purchased these books laregely based on the recommendations here at Amazon. However, I was extremely dissappointed in them. I stopped reading after book one. Perhaps my problem was in my expectations. I was looking for an excellent narrative on the crusades. These read more like a reference/text book.The pages are THICK with information. However, the failure of the author is that he just doesn't ""tell"" the story. In a single page he can introduce 5 locations and 10 people, 8 of whom are dead before the page is finished. If you are looking for detailed information on the crusades, I can only assume that it is likely in these tomes. If you are looking for the story of the crusades, you won't find it here."
4,Great Christmas Gift,I ordered this for my son for Christmas along with the Ratatouille movie. He loved both gifts and it has encouraged my son to cook with me in the kitchen.
5,Here mousie!!,"Remy is adorable! He talks, he walks, he wiggles his ears and nose!!I thought this toy would be much smaller than its actual size! Fun to leave on a table to see how many adults squeeze his nose!"
3,The picture is a little deciving,"Nothing is as cute as looking at Ratatouille with a chef hat and a wooden spoon in hand and the thought of him sitting in the office, creating a conversation and laughs. Unfortunately the picture and size of the toy is deceiving and it's bigger than it looks. It's a lot bigger than the picture posted on Amazon and is hardly the small corner toy to put near the computer and display should the boss walk in. Overall, it's cute and creates a lot of giggles for the little ones."
5,"Love my ""Little Chef!""","I ordered the Little Chef (Remy) because I loved the movie, ""Ratatouille."" It was a charming and delightful animated film that portrayed a rat with gourmet tastes and ambitions. I'm like that too, though not a rat. During all the Christmas preparations this year, the Little Chef assisted, in its way, mostly by keeping me smiling. It sniffed the ingredients I was using, making appropriate comments that made me and my family laugh. With six grandchildren running around, it's important to keep the grandmother (me) happy."
1,The Little Chef,"I bought this toy as a gift and the person receiving it lives in another state and hasn't received it yet, so I can't really answer the questions that have been asked with the exception of being educational. I don't believe this toy would have any edcational value. I listed it as only one star in each category, because the web site wouldn't let me continue unless I put something in there. Maybe amazon might want to re think their survey questions for people whom buy for gifts also, just an idea on my part."
5,At last!,"My VHS from 1985 is not usable anymore, thank God this DVD came out with even more features!"
4,Good Maiden DVD,"If you like Iron Maiden then you'll be interested in this. It continues the documentary and it is alright to watch if you really care; probably not something to watch more than a few times. The live footage is really good picture quality and you get to see all sorts of angles of the band including guitar closeups. Since there's lots of footage you could spend a few hours enjoying Maiden. Plenty of behind the scenes tape is revealed and is quite entertaining. So, metalheads can get their fix here raw British heavy metal."
5,Vintage DVD,"One of the greatest Maiden performances, from the good old days!! Was really cool to re-live how it must've been in the 80s!! A cool addition of the ""Behind the Iron Curtain"" on this DVD. Totally worth the cost, get this now!!"
3,Legendary Concert from the 80's,"This concert is legendary. I believe it was the World Slavery Tour in 83, Long Beach Arena. I had this on VHS when I was a kid. It was the greatest concert ever.... back then.Now? The video is atrocious. Absolutely sickening. It defiles my awesome TV to show such an analog 4:3 display on it. The audio sounds better coming out of my ass after a bowl of beans. I must have smoked a lot of weed as a kid because this DVD sucks in terms of quality.It was supposed to be a trip down memory lane. It turned into a technological nightmare. Still, if you've ever seen this concert, it's worth a few bucks to put it in your collection."
3,I agree with some of you about this DVD...,"It's a great show, no doubt. But, the video is horrid! It's a VHS copy put onto a disk. I love this band and to see how it was made, well, I think they should have done more. We waited 10+ years, passed up all those crummy ""DVDs"" on other sites, and all we got was the same thing as a videotape.I have not had a chance to listen to in the 5.1, but I hope it's more up to par.This is only my 2 cents..."
3,Good package,"Well, at least we have the classic VHS LIVE AFTER DEATH released as a DVD. The package is well crafted, the content is good. So why do I rate it only three stars? There goes the explanation.1) ""History of Iron Maiden Part II"". Even being very interesting to watch, contraty to the first part, where we really follow the band from its conception until the Piece of Mind time, in this one we have one hour about Powerslave"" only. It's almost like the ""Classic Album"" series for ""The NUmber of the Beast"", but this time it's for ""Powerslave"".2) The Rock in Rio concert. Although no fault of the band or producers, the sound is so atrocious and damaged that it's embarrassing..."
4,A Great Prefomance,"First of all, I own the VHS of Live After Death. They put on one heck of a monster show, one can not expect anything less of Iron Maiden. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the sound quality is something to be desired. But of course I do own the ""original"" release. I do not know what the soud quaility is of the CD version. But, all in all, this sould definatly be a part of any Maiden fan collection. UP THE IRONS!"
5,Simply the Best from Maiden,"This is by far the best Iron Maiden live concert DVD. This proves that Maiden are not only excellent musicians, but showmen as well. Nicko's drumming is some of the best ever heard on a Maiden DVD and Murray's moving guitar solo on the number ""Powerslave"", make this DVD worth purchasing. The extras are great too showing how hard this band has worked for it's fans. The interviews are great as well, I especailly like the interview with Harris, McBrain and Dickerson, concering the argument Harris and McBrain had and Dickerson recorded. Very funny. It's great that this DVD is availble as the current tour ""Back Somewhere in Time"" uses a simaliar stage to the ""Powerslave"" Tour from the 80's. I have seen the current tour and it's like going back in time. For any Maiden fan that has not purchased this DVD, it's well worth cost. If you don't purchase any other Maiden concert DVD's and only purchase this one, you did the right thing. Up the Irons!!!"
4,Great only if your a big fan of iron maiden,I watched the dvd and it was great music but the 80's looked so cheesy.
1,Disk Quality Issues,Obviously I love everything about this band and the series of dvd's BUT I bought 2 copies (one for me and one as a gift) and both have a HUGE audio problem. Basically sound volume fluctuates throughout the DVD. Another friend has this DVD with no issues. I just want you tonot be surprised if you need to exchange it for a new one...looks like some bad manufacturing out there.
1,Now I know why I hated the 80's,"Now don't get me wrong, 666 is a wonderful DVD, but this one is a dud.This DVD is hideous. First off the main show was filmed in 35mm. What these producers didn't tell us is, they just copied the film from a VHS master tape. The video quality is bootlegish. 35mm film should transfer into wonderful 16:9 1080p quality. Now I know why I sold my audio gear in the early 80's and left the scene for 25 years. The 80's were the dark ages of R&R; music. Those costumes are repulsive and the music was lost, just a shadow of what it was in the 60's and early 70's.....We had this metal music and disco. What a sad era in music it was. Get yourself some Blue Cheer.Get this on CD and listen to the music. Forget the rest."
5,Todays music just dont compare,What a tour. covers their first three albums the 80's was a better world. this thing completely rocks from beginning to end no metal fan should be without this DVD. very high quality picture and sound highly recomend it
2,"Has not aged well, I remembered this being much better","The video seems very VHS-ish, like they just put a video tape onto DVD. Picture quality is not so great. Bruce also does not seem to be able to hit the high notes, check out Aces High, it is painful to hear. The guitars are way too low, you cannot even hear the rhythm guitar. The CD version sounds much better. Was struck by how circus clownish the costumes look, with everyone wearing stripes and the drummers outfit is hideous. Bruce is only one dressed as a rocker, but he struggles with the high notes. He has excellent between song banter. This was better when I was a teenager in 1985!"
5,very imporatant and close to my heart,Firebears are firemen bears that protect and serve in their area. The book shows what life in like at the station when the bears are waiting for a fire call. The first call they go on is to rescue a kitten from a tree. The next time they are called to fire at a business. After that fire is out they are called to another fire. This one is at someone home. The firefighters get the bears out safely and put out the fire. Then it's back to the station to await the next call!I like that the bear fire fighters in the book were shown doing more than just putting out fires. Lots of kids think that is all they do.Yes we would. Fire safety is very important. This simple picture book is a gentle way to introduce kids to fire fighters and the jobs that they do.
5,Hit with our 2 year-old nephew,This is the book our 2-year old nephew wants to read every night before bed. The book is adorable and has a good balance of text/pictures and the action keeps moving so it's not dull for child or adult. I recommend this book to anyone with a young child.
3,Large is not quite large enough,"The gloves are not quite as long as they look in the picture, and the large still has short and narrow fingers."
1,Makes dishwater discolored,These gloves may be fine for dirty jobs but in my opinion they are not suitable for washing dishes. After a few minutes of washing dishes something leaches out of the gloves that makes the water look yellow (gross and icky). I don't know what kind of chemicals are used in the gloves but I don't want my dishes to be washed in dirty water. I have never had this problem with other brands that I have used.
5,Playtex gloves,Gloves are thick yet still provide tactile sensitivity for gripping. Love the cuffs which channel water back down the arm.
2,"Mediocre, but has a few bright spots","I'm not sure whether this book was a good purchase. Most of the stuff it contains is already in the product documentation. There are a few bright spots, however, so I wouldn't say the book is a complete waste of time. The thing that really surprised me about it was how thick the paper was - I thought the book was really more substantial than it is. I guess I'd rank this as a beginner's guide. If you're new to TranactSQL procedural programming, it might be useful to you."
2,Pretty disappointing,"I really wish a true expert in the field would write a book on T-SQL stored procedure programming. These guys obviously don't know what the heck they're doing. The code here is some of the worst I've ever seen. I'd never, ever hand code out like this myself, let alone try to get it published. It's arcane, banal, and demonstrates poor techniques, techniques that don't perform well, and bad habits by the authors. I can't really think of any redeeming qualities - basically seems like a real waste of print."
4,For Any SQL/ASP/VB/Java/middleware Programmer,This book really helped me to discover the proper and efficient use of stored procs. It covers every aspect of dealing with stored procedures and really is a must have for any SQL/ASP/VB/Java programmer. 4-star material for experts 5-star meterial for non-specialists
3,Better books (will) exist,"Not too bad, but I feel like this book barely covers the basics, and goes nowhere near advanced topics. If you need the basics, check out Rob Vieira's Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming - the SQL 7 version of his book was by far the best place for beginners to learn SQL Server programming."
1,"Errors, errors, errors","Worst coding book I've ever made the mistake of buying. Code is silly, simplistic and arcane. Formatting is even worse. Knowledge of TransactSQL is obviously lacking. These guys should have a look a Henderson's Guru's Guide to TransactSQL book. Now THAT'S a well-written coding book. They could learn a thing or two from it.Note to authors: we aren't fooled by thick paper and printouts of Query Analyzer. Don't waste trees or our time with this kind of stuff."
1,Returned mind yesterday for a refund,"I returned my copy of this book yesterday for a refund. It's the sorriest excuse for a programming book I've ever seen. They use really thick paper to make the book seem longer, but they don't fool anyone. The book is quite possibly the worst programming book I've ever read."
1,Don't bother,Had my hopes up when I saw this new book on stored procs. Boy what a let donw. Don't bother with this one - its not worth the effort. Worst book I ever bought.
1,Worthless,"This has got to be the worst SQL book ever written. It's full of cliches and shallow explanations, toy examples and buggy code. This one isn't worth even flipping through."
5,Great for Oracle to SQL server,The book helped me to convert the database from Oracle (PL/SQL) to SQL server (TSQL).
4,well written,"The book is well written with many good samples. I use it whenever I get in a bind on Stored Proc programming. The only problem is that, unlike other publishers (Wrox), there is no available code samples online. One great thing about Wrox books is that if I want to see a sample work, I don't have to retype the whole thing. This publisher should work on that feature."
1,Returning mine,"Five problems:1. Code is stupid and unhelpful. Either theexamples are too kludgy to be useful or too simplistic to teach youanything2. Code formatting is impossible to read. I'd beembarrassed to circulate anything I'd written formatted likethis.3. Writing is terribly dull. There's a way to keep thereader engaged in a technical book. These guys haven't found it.4.Far too many screen pictures. Ken Henderson's Guru's Guide toTransact-SQL laments this trend and rightfully so. We don't need ahalf page shot of Query Analyzer to see the results of a small query....5. SQL 2K coverage is lacking. There are several deviations(timestamp and @@identity being two examples) into things that areeither obsolete or moot points in SQL 2K. The authors appear not toknow SQL 2K very well. It looks like the book was written for SQL 7,then retitled when it ran late.What does all this mean? I'msending my copy back, that's what."
1,Complete waste,"I can't think of anything good to say about this book. It's dull, lacks any code worth talking about, contains numerous errors and leaves out important topics. It's a sloppily put together joke of a book that I wish I hadn't spent money on."
2,"Not a very good book, esp. if you know what you're doing","What a disappointment! The examples in this book are among the worst I've seen. First of all, the formatting of the code is inconsistent from example to example and with any format I've ever seen. I'd be embarrassed to use it myself. Second, the examples are ridiculously simple -- they don't show you anything. Third, there are way too many screen pictures in this book. Do I need a screen picture of every stored procedure result?If you're looking for the ultimate reference on stored procedure programming, keep looking."
2,Not too much value,"Book is pretty worthless. It's poorly written, doesn't cover important topics and contains loads of errors. Wasn't what I was expecting at all."
1,Very poor quality,"Poor code (doesn't work, uses bad techniques, etc.) + poor prose = poor book. I've never seen such a useless programming book. And they thought they'd fool me with the thick paper - that just makes it worse. Be smart. Spend your money elsewhere."
1,Very disappointing,"I'm disappointed with almost every aspect of this book. This book proves what I've been thinking for several years now: the Osborne books have steadily gone down in quality, and this one is at or near the very bottom. I don't know where they get these authors, but they get people who obviously don't have a lot of writing experience. This one reads like a long, poorly written email. Usually, I find a technical nugget here and there in the books I buy, even the bad ones. This one is complete devoid of anything of value. It's so bad that I'm sending it back for a refund."
1,Don't judge this one by its cover,"This book doesn't cover SQL Server 2000 in any depth, doesn't cover stored procedures to any great degree, and doesn't offer anything insightful re: programming. Basically, the book doesn't do what the cover claims. It was a complete waste of my time."
1,Not worth a penny,Basically a reprint of the BOL. The worst part of the book is the XML coverage. It is nearly verbatim from the online docs. I think they added XML just to sell books. There's absolutely nothing here that isn't also in the BOL
2,Doesn't last,I have had this printer for less than a year and it is already dying on me. The paper jams about 75% of the time and it pulls more than one sheet of paper almost all the time. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I will be replacing mine very soon.
2,"Great Printer, but jams ALOT","This printer is great - cheap, fast, small and produces great text. The toner cartridges are pricey, but fine.However, mine is jaming all the time. It feeds two or three pages together alot. Sometimes, it is jaming every page! Very frustrating. Some paper brands seem to work better, but I am not sure which. I use 20lb paper, maybe 24 works better, I don't know. It drives me nuts! Sometimes I have to put in one page at a time just to keep it from jaming. Sure, it is pretty easy to clear a jam, but if I dread printing a 15 page document because it is going to jam like to times. One thing that helps is to keep the paper guides snug to the paper - cuts down own the jams, but they still happen alot. Maybe sticking with laser printer paper helps, but copier paper and multipurpose jam ALOT.If not for the Jams, I would give this printer a four star rating (five if the toner was cheaper).Anyone have any advice?"
5,"Bruce Singer is taking on the 21st Century as the latest ""humor therapist""","It has been said that a laugh a day keeps the doctor away...and at a laugh per page at 399 pages, this book should keep you healthy and laughing well over a year.Bruce Singer is a humorist extraordinaire. As Mark Twain was in the 19th and Will Rogers in the 20th Centuries, Bruce Singer is taking on the 21st Century as the latest ""humor therapist.""Mark Twain once said ""the human race has only one really effective weapon, and that's laughter."" Hey... Just Tell the Truth should be your weapon of choice to raise your spirits, relieve stress and harness the healing power of humor.Keep up the good work ""Dr."" Bruce!"
4,Must have for the back of your commode!,"Hey...Just Tell the Truth Be Not a Lying LiarWhat a delightful discovery this book is---written by a little known author and published by a little known publisher. It just proves that wonderful jewels, gold, and oil can be discovered in unusual places. Just pick it up and read two or three of its snappy witticisms---many of them actual quotes. It is a great addition to the back of anyone's commode, which is guaranteed to bring a smile to the face of your family and friends.A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR FUN READING AND SHARING COLLECTION"
1,Cannot contact,I wanted to return the taillight and both emailed and called the seller multiple times for return information. Have not received any responses.
5,Another Winning Season,"Another winner for the writers, actors and crew. Just love the characters and storylines. The character Neal Caffrey is soooo charming. Very funny, sexy, smart and always entertaining. Can actually watch this show with the entire family. Looking forward to watching season 4. Again, I'm hoping they will be releasing ALL seasons in blueray soon - please!."
4,Exellent,Love this series. Excellent character development and production. I wasn't able to catch all the episodes when it originally aired. Now I can watch it all at once.
5,Season Three: White Collar,Enjoy this series. All the actors are excellent and work off each other to perfection. Awaiting the next season but the producers and writer(s) have to kill Matt as a ladies' man. Are they going by the exposure he is a single father of 2 and keeps his private life PRIVATE?? (NBC) The actors are incredible and the story lines excellent but off this macho bit and get to the action & humor and suspense that made this series so watched and loved. Flesh is a distraction when the story lines are so strong. Will keep watching it but the flesh scenes take away from the original story line.
2,"Disappointed in the increase amount of sex, sexual orientation, and language in this show","We have been fans of this show until the last several episodes. We are disappointed that a show that was clean and fun to watch has increasing sexual content, overt homosexuality and more and more language. Don't you get it, it was a hit without the garbage, why do you have to ruin it?"
3,Love and Hate...,"I LOVE this show, but I hate that Peter and Neal are no longer friends. This is a deal breaker for me. :("
2,Lost Interest,I have the first 2 seasons of this series and I have lost interest in the show. It is not as good as it was in the beginning.
2,Question I've been dying to ask??,"If there are two stars of the show, why is Matt Bomer's face the only one on every CD cover?"
4,great show,We had this show added to our Amazon Prime Account. We love the show and are glad to own it but found that streaming it was tedious. It kept loading at annoying moments in the show. WE finally paused it and waited thirty minutes to get it completely loaded before turning it back on. Normally we have good internet strength but always seems streaming shows is a strain for it.
5,show,"This is a great show, if you do not have this series to date buy it. You will never regret it it is that good."
5,loved it!,Watched 2-3 episodes a week and got through it too quick...now we're anxiously awaiting the next season. This is quite a fun and intriguing series!
5,Great start to the new season,"This episode is a great start to season 3 of White Collar. If you've not seen the season 2 finale, you really do need to watch it before you watch this episode for it to make complete sense. And ideally, you will have watched both previous seasons. White Collar is a very approachable show, with a slightly different concept than other procedural crime dramas in that a criminal helps the cops. It's interesting seeing the character development that continues to occur in several of the main characters as the seasons have progressed, and this episode clearly shows that development from several characters. I look forward to continuing this season."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! PIRATED DVDS!!! DO NOT EVEN PLAY!!! COMPLETE RIP OFF!!!,"This is not an authentic White Collar Season 3 DVD set! In fact it is a pirated set. The first DVD doesn't even play and the other DVDs are so pixelated and choppy that there is no way this set is genuine! I understand that $15 dollars is an absolute steal for a brand new set of these DVDs, but that is what was advertised. Would never have bought illegal pirated DVDs! I honestly cannot believe that Amazon allows your company to sell on their site. All your wonderful reviews most definitely must also be a fraud, because no one is going to be happy or satisfied with ripped versions of DVDs. I what these exchanged for REAL AUTHENTIC White Collar Season 3 DVDS or my money BACK!!! Not only did you rip me off, but also pirating movies is against the law!"
2,eh,I feel like the show is less interesting and I guess I am miffed at having to pay for it when other shows are available on line for free or with my Netflix subscription.
5,Thank you,"delivery was amazing as was the wrapping and quality! couldn't have asked for anything better! a*, just wish I could buy season 1 and 2 at the same price haha x"
4,white collar,"Love Matt Bomber so cool, he is perfect in the role, love the characters in White Collar and such a great story!"
4,Matt Bomer. Yum!,Great show. I've enjoyed each season. The whole cast is terrific but come on- Matt Bomer is a hottie. No question about it.
5,Cool,A catchy series that is very entertaining. Characters are very entertaining with unusual cases and very quirky ways to solve the crime.
5,When's the release?!?,"With a slick ensemble of intelligent and entertaining characters, White Collar continues to engage the viewer and provide an engaging story. What's the delay with releasing S3 on DVD, though?? I'm eager to add it to my collection and look forward to mamy more successful seasons."
5,White Collar,"This is a great series. It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what Neal will do next, and see how Peter catches him at it. Great cast as well."
4,"Gives a taste, may have spoilers","This video gives a taste of White Collar season 3. It has scenes in it you may not wish to know are coming if you're a purist, but without seeing season 3, I can't state for sure that they are spoilers."
4,Love It,This show is one of the best and recommend it to everyone. So excited to have gotten this season on sale!
3,More of the same,"The characters remain well-dressed, of course, and there is something to be said for that, but overall, this season is really just more of the same. I found myself unable to continue towards the end and just ended up reading reviews of the last couple episodes. I guess there was some plot development, but I was very unsatisfied with the show this season, and will probably not be coming back in the future, except, of course, to see more pictures of the suits that are worn."
5,exactly what she wanted!,This was purchased for my daughter who loves it. It came within a couple of days and was well packed.
5,"Cover to cover, you'll be fascinated and amazed with death.","Do you have any thoughts on how you will leave this Earth? After reading this book, you will most certainly question the thought. You will read and re-read chapters with such curiosity. Examples of freak accidents, gruesome serial slayings, Mother Nature, plagues and epidemics, poltergiest, genocide, and Spontaneous Human Combustion just name a few of the documented stories covered. This light-hearted book is full of death stories, ancient traditions, and phenomina. If nothing else, you'll be wondering how you will go. As it is, all life does come to an end. Oh yeah - interested in learning what happens to a body within the first few weeks of death? Check it out!"
3,"Putting The ""Fun"" In Funeral","Perfect for the death enthusiast. I really enjoy the ""famous last words"" segments. Also includes trivia tidbits and short stories."
5,This book is fascinating.,"The Big Sleep is the kind of weird, funny, fascinating book that keeps you saying, ""Just one more page."" Some of those chapters really knocked me out . . . like ""Death Styles of the Rich and Famous"" or ""Hell No, We Won't Go"". It's far from some morose book on the realities of death. I loved the quotes, the jokes, and those incredible factoids. Hey, who knew that Balanchine died from a form of Mad Cow disease or that the Marquis de Sade died in an insane asylum. Crazy stuff."
2,Not worth it.,"I enjoyed the authors' snarky, irreverent tone. (""Aztec society, known for its human sacrifices, made distinctions of which direction you traveled after death depending on how you died. Human sacrifices went east to paradise and got to enjoy the sun. Seems a high price to pay for a tan."") But that doesn't change the fact that the book was very sloppily researched and contains dozens of inaccuracies. There are better books of death trivia out there, such asThis Will Kill You: A Guide to the Ways in Which We GoandAfter the Funeral: The Posthumous Adventures of Famous Corpses."
3,Ok,Its an ok product. My crystals have fallen off and the snap ons have broken off and I keep my phone in my purse. Never having it drop before. The product is cool but does not last long
2,Not Sturdy,I have had this product on my phone for one week. the first time it hit thed floor all the crystals fell off.
1,Late,"My cell phone cover was supposed to be shipped July 2-3, and received July 5-10. It just shipped today, on the 10th. I will not be doing business with this company again!"
3,"half history, half romantic tale of a little known war","I was hoping for more historical details, but overall it was an entertaining look at the war that could have ended the U.S. experiment of democracy. The author has an annoying habit of telling all the preliminary details of individual battles, then abruptly skipping to something completely unrelated. There was absolutely nothing about Commodore Perry, which disappointed this reader. The book is at its best with bringing life the Jacksons, the Madisons, Gen. Scott and his love life, and the petty feuds among the many incompetent leaders of the time."
5,Shaara-esque 1812,"In the genre of the Shaara's, 1812 gives an insightful look into a war usually skipped over in history classes. Good profiles of James Madison, Andrew Jackson, and a young Winfield Scott as individuals. A ""must read"" for history teachers and history lovers; recommended as extra reading for students high school and above."
4,a worthwhile read,"This is an enjoyably absorbing book.You will get a close and personal look at some of America's greatest men,most notably James Madison and Andrew Jackson.Read about their love for our country and the love and lust for their wives, Dolley Madison and Rachel Jackson.Understand the War of 1812 as well!"
2,Reads like a bad romance novel,"I was very disappointed with this book, for a number of reasons:1. Way too much ink is wasted going over again and again the feelings of love between James and Dolly Madison and Andrew and Rachel Jackson Jackson. OK, we get it, but the prose is awful, even for a dime store novel.2. Frank Key? Jimmy Monroe? Come on.3. It would have been nice to throw in some British viewpoints to flesh things out.4. If you want a better book, read Walter Borneman's ""1812""Also, if you want to read some good historical fiction about the War for Independence, read 'The Rise to Rebellion' and 'The Glorious Cause' by Jeff Shaara. Good books."
2,"Way too much fiction, not enough history","I read this book based on reviews describing the rich narrative on the war. I was disappointed. There could have been much more on how decisions were made; particularly in regards to the treaty that ended the conflict. The cringe factor is very high with ridiculous dialogue and unnecessary descriptions of arousal of ""Jimmy"" Madison by Dolly and other personal relationships and dialogue that did not seem credible. The build up to the battle of New Orleans was interminable relative to any other part of the book and still did not give a good account of what actually happened. I read to the end because this is a war that has not been deeply covered by historians but this was not a suitable alternative."
5,American originals!!!!,"I love roots music overall and this is great roots rock in touch with history. I still remember sitting on my bed in high school watching MTV and seeing ""Gettysburg"" come on. I was hooked on the song right away and the first record was great. After that I never heard anything about the Brandos again. I am so glad I rediscovered them and highly recommend this CD because it highlights the Brandos at their best. They are a no nonsense roots rock band and are true American originals."
2,"A compilation of uptempo Disco and R&B tracks that should not be a part of the ""Smooth Grooves"" series.","Rhino's ""Smooth Grooves"" series most definitely took a turn for the worse on this volume. Just what this compilation's producers were thinking of when they decided to include the songs by Dynasty, Kraftwerk, Marvin Gaye, Ashford & Simpson, Kano, The People's Choice and the others that managed to make it onto this CD is beyond me as they are all uptempo Disco hits that got plenty of exposure in the clubs but that most certainly don't belong on a romantic music series. If you are looking for a compilation of late-1970s or early-'80s Disco and Urban R&B you'll probably like this compilation but it should never have been included as part of the ""Smooth Grooves"" line."
2,Ye Olde Spy Inn,"It is a vey nice work of fiction, with more than a hint of the paranormal. However, I had hoped to be getting my hands on something with a bit more solid historical content. Oh, well, you get lucky sometimes, and sometimes you don't."
5,"A great ""'Devil May Cry"" box set by Capcom for the PS2!!!","This is a great box set from Capcom for the PS2!!! It includes: ""Devil May Cry"",Devil May Cry 2"" and ""Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition"" in a awesome collectors box!!! A great set for the Devil May Cry fan!!! Long live Dante!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
5,Woot! DMC trilogy set.,Bought this a few years ago and enjoyed the whole series. Maybe not DMC 2 as much as the others but yeah. . . Anyway the story is good. The battle system is fun and rewarding. Dante is kick-ass. I recommend it for anyone who hasn't played it.
4,Great set made worse by the second games addition,"Devil May Cry was a superb game that I have very fond memories of. However the sequel turned out to be the largest disappointment I've ever experienced from a game. 3 was both a return to form and a change in direction for the series, but all in all an excellent game for anyone looking to kick some demon butt and challenge themselves. If you get this set, don't bother with 2. It's not a broken game, but it's almost completely devoid of fun or anything that made the first game special. If you enjoy games like God of War, Dante's Inferno, Heavenly Sword, and the new Castlevania, You should enjoy this set."
5,DMC Perfection!,"This collection, which contains DMC DMC2 and DMC3:SE is a fantastic buy! When I saw it, I knew I just had to get it! The second game in the series caught a bad rap for departing from the first game from a character perspective, but the gameplay is still solid. In my personal opinion, the Devil May Cry series is a must own for anyone who loves action games. One of the best out there, five stars all the way!!!"
5,Fantastic Pain Reliever for Sunburn,"I have used the Dermoplast spray for relief from sunburn and from allergic reactions that result in histamine release and redness of skin. When I have a sunburn and I can't get to sleep, I spray the affected area and it feels better for the next day. When I get an allergic reaction resulting in redness of skin and persistent itching, the Dermoplast spray provides immediate relief. I highly recommend Dermoplast."
4,Good For Short-Term Use,"I was satisfied with short-term use. It began giving me acne. I also scarred anyway. It did NOT get infected! My doctor's office suggested to use the Bacitracin instead, so I switched bewtween the two. It was okay, although I did think it rather expensive--a friend that shares in-home care of elderly mother-in-law suggested it."
2,Not an Italian Charm,"While this charm is very beautiful, it is NOT an Italian Charm and will not fit as a link in an Italian Charm bracelet, or even in a normal ""dangle"" charm bracelet. The the picture of this item is decieving."
5,Simply THE BEST.,I watch everything I can get my hands on from the U.K. I just watched these four episodes and feel this is as good as it gets. Simply brilliant.
3,Vera,The setting and locale not quite what we had expected. Found it a little difficult to get into the theme of the series and feel some people might have a problem with the accent. We like this actress very much but not in this type of role.
3,Worth It For Two Great Songs,"Ms. King is my favorite R & B singer. Her best work is the ultra-classic, Smooth Talk, her first album-every song a gem. This one has two great songs: ""Flirt"" and ""Hold On To What You've Got""-both should have been dance club hits with lots of remixes. Worth purchasing for these songs alone."
2,Solid Copper? not likely,"We own this exact same strainer(was a gift) and I'm looking for a new one since this doesn't appear to be solid copper - I believe it's copper clad over non-magnetic steel(?). The feet and handles appear to be brass. First the protective clear coat comes off and it gets that nice copper patina then after about a year and a half the copper itself has worn off leaving a greyish silver finish . Its perfect for berries, or other light/dry use or if you wanted to use it for decoration / center piece with things in it but use gently and don't scrub or soak too long. Functionally great but aesthetically blah after a while."
1,Not Solid Copper,This product is listed as solid copper....It is plated steel with brass accents. Way over priced for the quality. False Advertisement to say the least.
4,"Mystery Solved, But NOT By Tamara!","I always Njoy Tamara Hayle's PI work, however, this time, she stumbled into discovering who the the killer was, rather than the use of her keen instincts, that I've grown accustomed to.I've had the book for months, and picked it up and sat it down, so it wasn't the immediate page-turners the other Hayle series have been. However, Ms. Wilson-Wesley DID keep the readers guessing.Overall...It's a very decent mystery!"
3,Easier to Read&#65533;.,"I was a little disappointed in the outcome of this book. Yet, I'm aware that mysteries are always with a suspect way from the lift, this one was way out there. The killer was even boring and didn't live up to the suspense of the book. I have read all of Ms. Wesley's Tamara Hayle's mysteries and this one was strictly for fans only. If you didn't read the others first you would not have an idea of other characters. I was also disappointed in Basil Dupre's absence from the novel. Yet I understand Tamara Hayle's love affair with Jake, which isn't going anywhere and should, however Basil gives her love life a spice to Tamara character until Jake sorts out his love for her. My advice to Ms. Wesley is to hurry up and revamp Tamara mysteries with more interest in her love life and also more exciting killers."
3,Angels with Devilish sides,"This is the first book I've read by Valerie Wilson Wesley; I'd gotten it from my mom, and I wasn't that intrigued by the cover. Finally I'd come across it again and decided to at least read the first chapter, which lead to the second, the third, and then I was finished. It was a fast, mysterious read, and I mostly liked it! All of the mystery, the suspects, the mother in her, as well as the secret love she held in her heart, however I didn't love the ending! I was shocked by who the killer turned out to be, but I'd thought of different angles--OH WELL... I will be giving Tamara Hayle another try, to see if maybe this was clumsy as one of the previous reviewers said."
5,This book is a Must Read!!!,"I just want to say... Go get this book! Mrs. Wesley has done it again! I really enjoyed reading ""Easier To Kill."" I feel like I know Tamara, Jamal and Jake on a personal level. And Just thinking about Jan's Beauty Bisquit reminds me of a shop that I get my hair done at. Mrs. Wesley definitely keeps it real. I have read all of her novels and loved each and every one of them. The ending was a pure shock to me. I'm sure it was to many others also.""Movin On Up"" LoL"
3,Tamara Hayle solves another one,"I have read all of Valerie Wesley Wilson books and this one was quite different. The others had more excitement in the story and the killers were more exciting. I felt as if I was watching a old black and white detective show while reading this book. I could imagine how difficult it was for Tamara to work for Mandy with all of the half truths being told to her by all her suspects and especially Mandy. The ending, the identity of the killer and the motive, was definitely a surprise. While this book was good, it was not on the caliber of say The Devils Gonna Get Him."
3,"Fast read, but too many loose ends; had potential.","Easier to kill started out good. It got your attention immediately. But by mid book, teasers (Jake, Tamara, and Yolanda) peaked your interest but nothing happened with it. The ending was definitely a surprise but unconvincing. I think the author could have developed the story more and it would have been a much better book."
2,Very disappointing,"In ""Easier to Kill,"" Mrs. Wilson-Wesley seems to have her character slowing down for some reason. She us not that vibrant go-getter as she once was. I am starting to believe that Tamara Hayle is getting to be too old for the private detective business. The book had some eye stretching points, but for the most part, the ending was very disappointing. In the first two series, I couldn't put the books down! In fact, I read them both in a matter of days. But this, by far, has got to be Valerie's most uninspiring work to date. Either retire Tamara and let her raise her son or bring back the excitement that she had once before."
1,Non US format,I'm sure the DVD would be great if I could use it. Was not obvious in the product description that it is non US format.
3,for code jockeys that need a quick reference for their angle brackets,"XML: the grab-bag, so-what-you-will, make-it-up-as-you-go-along, there-are-rules-strict-rules-(sort-of) technology that bends you to its will as much as you can bend it to yours. And this book is a decent round-up of the most common, widely-deployed implementations -- with enough general knowledge to help you sort through the more specific ones (or help you in creating your own).A better title for it might have been: ""XML: A Developer's Almanac"". (Which, I suppose is a good-enough alternative title for any book in the O'Reilly ""Nutshell"" series.)"
2,Not an introductory tutorial,"I chose this book after reading the glowing reviews here at Amazon, hoping to use it as an introductory tutorial to XML. I was disappointed!The writing style chosen by the author is terse, as if writing space is at a premium - and this for a book which is 600+ pages long. The examples are badly chosen in my opinion, and the explanation of basic concepts is presented in the style of a reference manual. Take for example the explanation of the NOTATION element attribute: ""A notation type attribute contains the name of a notation declared in the document's DTD... In theory, it could be used to associate types with particular elements, as well as limiting the types associated with the elements"".At this stage, I gave up on this book and went instead to Hunter's ""Beginning XML"". Still, all wasn't lost: I read a colleague's copy, so at least I wasn't out of pocket."
5,Covers almost every major XML standard,"This is a combination field guide and terse standards reference for XML. It covers an amazing variety of XML standards. From the fundamentals of XML, through the document standards, and into transformation technologies like XSLT. Standards include; XML, XPath, XLink, XSLT, XSL-FO, XML Schema, DTDs, among others. The book also cover some standards that use XML, like SAX and DOM.The book is fairly high level. It assumes that you know the basics and need a complete reference for the technologies. This is that case with all of the Nutshell books, but given the amount of technologies this books cover, the coverage is fairly terse.The organization of the book is great. There are only a few illustrations and they are used effectively. A solid reference for anyone who works with XML technologies on a daily basis. Highly recommended."
4,Rockport Mary Jane,"The Rockport Mary Jane shoe is very comfortable and just the right height for work. It is not too flat, which sometimes is not very comfortable, and not too high to walk in. I walk a lot at work, and needed a shoe that was roomy at the toe, and not so flat that I looked too casual. The shoe is nicely padded, shoe and flexible. It is not very dressy, but somewhere in between. The price was great and I am pleased with the shoes."
4,Nice Shoe,"I took a chance on these shoes as they are a medium width. I have a bunion on my right foot. The first time I wore them, they were a bit tight on that foot. They stretched just enough to make them comfortable. I can walk all day in these shoes. Good buy."
4,Very interesting assembly of old recordings!,"This particular set of CD's has many more old recordings than any other set I had experienced. Some of the songs neither I or my wife had heard before. We were imopressed by the selection. Even if some of the older recordings were damaged and could not be completely refurbished, the quality was good!"
5,Beautiful Sounds,"I've been looking for just one album that has a really good sampling of the Red Army Choir. There are many other wonderful songs not on this album, but this is a nice sampling of these wonderful voices. Truly beautiful music!"
2,Not great!,"Not a very comprehensive collection. Most of the most famous songs of the Red/Soviet army were left out. Instead, some of the village songs were included."
2,Best of the Red Army Choir,"Songs are all great but some were recorded with inconsistent volume, not sure if this is because of quality of original tape copied from."
5,A must-have,"A bit of (russian) magic...Unusual, extraordinary, outstanding.I might be a fan of rock, pop, RnB, electro, etc...This is unquestionably my favourite CD.ññè, àñíé Àìèè,Ñàñèá ìí."
2,Very Little Practical Info,"For HR managers who want insight on dealing with real-life ethical problems, skip this book. For those looking for a theoretical overview, the book is solid, if not simplistic."
4,Perfect individual size,"This little pie dish is the perfect size for an individual savory pie accompanied by a side salad or a nice hunk of bread. It's not too deep (i.e. not a ramekin) and not too shallow - just a real pie dish in miniature.The pottery conducts heat evenly and the crust comes out just right. It is also attractive enough to bring directly to the table and the enamled glaze cleans up easily with just a short soak in the sink.Depending on how much you like your sweet pies, this could also be the perfect size for that too. If you love pie crust, the smaller size gives you a higher crust to filling ratio. Yum!The main thing when adapting recipes from a traditional large pie to these smaller dishes is that you'll need 1/4 more total crust than filling to acheive right balance."
3,False Advertising,"This is actually a 4.5"" pie pan. The quality of the pan is good, but the pan is too small to make a 5"" pie."
2,not worth the money or shipping,This was a waste of money. You can make your own up. I wish I could rate this better but I honestly can't. You can make your own up by just listing the bills you pay on sheet of paper and checking them off each month.
2,Better The First Time,"I just received this assortment of candy for the second time and I am quite disappointed. The only reason that I ordered the same one again was that my friend loves rock candy. The rock candy is no longer included, although it is still advertised as being in there.In fact, a lot of the candy that was in there the last time is gone. The pieces that were full sized before are no longer full size and the candy tastes as if it was also made in the sixties and has been sitting around since then, waiting for some sucker to order it. Do yourself a favor and save your money, it is not worth the price they charge at all."
2,just okay,"The selection was okay but some was stale. The box did not survive shipping very well and was torn in three places. Luckily it was only for my parents so I put it in a gift bag and peeled the sticker off the box. It was okay, but I prefer the Hometown Favorites one."
3,"Not a lot of candy, some items easy to find elsewhere","About 30 small pieces of candy, lots of shredded brown paper, and a nice box. Half the stuff I'd have trouble finding. The cool factor here is ""This is the candy that mom and dad had when we were kids"". I was a little hesitant about the candy cigarettes, pipes and cigars, but that was part of the era."
3,good prodect,we have receive it in time and in good condition but candy not too taste ...but all candy i think really old made that way its not today's times but all is best...
5,Happy times with the Retro Candy box,Extremely happy with the quality and quantity of the 1960's Retro Candy Gift Box. The person that received it thought it was the best gift ever.
3,Candy is stale,Bought this as a gift for my husband who loves this type of candy however most of the chewable items are stale and tough (and some even break off in hard chunks. Cool selection but not very fresh.
2,Retro Candy,"What there was as far as candy goes was fine but for the price - there should have been more candy and more of a variety, the packaging concept is great except both boxes arrived in a smashed & torn condition and it was too late to send them back so had to repair the best that we could."
2,Kinda eh,There really wasn't enough candy or variety. The picture is misleading. I wouldn't order this again. You could get a better deal buying these individually at the store.
1,nostalgic candy,Candy Crate nostalgic candy. Worst candy ever. Every piece of taffy was hard as a rock. Don't think some of the candy was from the 50's or 60's. Zero star rating. Do not fall for tis.
4,No one can kick like Chaka,"Chaka shines like the diva she is on one of the five new songs on ""Epiphany: the Best of Chaka Khan."" Produced by David Gamson, the track cruises at a breezy classic funk pace, giving Miss Thing plenty of room to work her voice to maximum effect. She is bolstered by a guest rap from Me'Shell Ndegeocello, whose chatting between verses adds street spice. Frankie Knuckles's rousing house remix will have club disciples twirling with delight."
3,"Good story, nice graphics, very hard puzzles. ""Expert"" game","The story line is nice. The design concept is really great. The video resolution isn't all that high so there isn't as much detail as you'd like to see in all of the cool visuals. One other factor that sets this game apart is that you play 2 characters and you have to play to both to win the game.The puzzles in this game are difficult. If you are good at patterns and linguistic type puzzles then you'll have a good time. If you are better suited to the physical object puzzles, you're not not going to have as good of a time.My taste is that I want the puzzles easy enough to allow me to make progress but hard enough that I don't finish the game in an hour. As a beginnner gamer, the puzzles in this game were just too hard to keep my interest and I gave up half way through."
2,Too much noise for nothing,"After too many ads and superb screenshoots I was really dissapointed. Don't expect that the real game is the same as the screenshots. The graphic is terrible compared to this in Myst III Exile. I expected to see something much better. Almost all graphics contain really big squares (10x10 or 15x15 pixels) and look like JPEG images that are compressed 70-80 times. Don't tell me that I have a hardware problem - I'm with PIII @ 1GHz, GeForce II, DirectX 8a and latest NVIDIA drivers, and games like Unreal Tournament, Deep Space Nine - The Fallen, Max Payne and Myst III Exile look fantastic on this machine.Maybe the DVD version is better.The mouse navigation is not good also."
1,Buy the DVD version!,"Do NOT buy the CD-ROM Version of this game! I made the mistake of buying the game on CD-ROM. The game was so butchered and chopped up just to get it to run in the CD-ROM drive that the game was impossible to play. I just got the DVD version. Its GREAT. The graphics flow. There are tiny animated sequences that are not in the CD-ROM version. There are many more clues and indicators that tell you that you are doing the right thing that are not available in the CD-ROM version. I have only played the DVD game for about an hour last night, but I am convinced!So far I would give the DVD version a 4 star rating."
3,"On second thought, worth playing","As good as other adventure games, just be sure you get a walkthrough because the puzzles and plot are in no way intuitive. Graphics could be better, but are still very original, and at times excellent, at times blurry. Still, IF you like adventure games, you will not be disappointed."
4,I discovered something! DO NOT BUY THE CD ROM VERSION!,"Apparently, according to the games creators (of which there are 6 working to an extremely low budget) the DVD version carries 9.6 GB of data compared to the CD Rom versions 2.3 or so. Hence, many scenes and areas were cut and some puzzles lft out. It also comes on one disk rather than five or so.The graphical quality is far superior, but that won't change anything unless you're a fan of games such as Atlantis and Myst 3. Like puzzles that'll keep you scratching your head forever? Buy it!If not, then why'd you even think about buying it in the first place? Fools!"
1,Schizm: Mysterious Journey,"Why aren't you offering the DVD version of the game? It is available from Dreamcatcher--but they have been having problems at their website and it is impossible to order either on the internet or by phone. One wonders if they have this much problem with their ordering process, how good can the game be. ???"
1,Disappointing,"I don't mind the graphics or interface of this game, but I do find the puzzles both trivial and frustrating. I don't much care for games that require me to keep detailed notes of obscure symbols, sounds, etc., some of which may be useful later. (I recognize that there are people that do enjoy this, and consider this a mark of a good game -- I'm simply not one of them. Since I don't usually play a game all at once, but over the course of two or three weeks, I find this process tedious.) I finally went to a walkthrough and, frankly, I never would have figured out the solution to the first puzzle. I'm not an idiot, and have played many of these kinds of games before, but this one is, in my opinion, not worth the trouble."
5,garvintx,Excellent book contains lots of information on mid-western one room schools. Highly recommended for any genealogists or historical researcher. Tells a complete story.
5,Best house renovation book I have ever read,"Having renovated 3 houses, I am always looking out for good books on the topic. Sadly, many of them are very superficial. This book is the exception. The information and attitude that Mr. Nash puts forth in this book is deep and highly informative. A must read for old house nuts."
4,"Interesting, slight change of formula here","In many ways this is a quintessential Francis novel, with a fairly normal, likeable hero put into a situation where he is subjected to physical and mental challenges. The plot here is pretty good, although somewhat far fetched. However, this novel varies from the typical successful Francis formuala by having a sexual interlude between the hero and a female supporting character quite early on in the story. This is unusual, since Francis' characters are typcially fairly chaste, but this has the addes uniqueness of having the supporting female character be an older woman who wants to experience sex and chooses the hero, barely recovered from a dangerous brush with criminal types, as her man. This is diverting mostly because it seems to me that it is so different from the norm! I was quite taken aback by this!"
3,Horses and accountants,"Hard to dislike anything Dick Francis writes. He writes so well.Risk, like all his books, is definitely worth a read and probably a re-read, but it is not one of his best.The story line is about an accountant who is an amateur jockey. Enjoy it and get another one by him to enjoy even more."
2,I SHALL NOT BE MOVED,"This historical compilation of the Harmonizing Four although well packaged with great liner notes about the history of the group; was very disappointing to me. I wished there was a better way to have cleaned up the production values so that the true essence of the group's vocal harmonies could distinctively be heard. Instead unfortunately it's like although Cd formatted; listening to a very aged 78/33 mp phonograph record on the 1st disc. The second disc was better due to the fact that they were some of the group's later recordings in their middle years. I just wished disc two would have had a better sampling, and featured the better of their best recordings. If you're a collector or history buff. This is for you. If you're desiring good quality listening? Skip this one! Over half of this project is inaudible and annoying static. Also if they'd featured their most famous songs mentioned in the liner notes it'd have made the difference."
2,bad soloists,"This is a symphony, and as far as that is concerned, This recording is very good. J?rvi brings out the best of the G?teborg sources, and it's all recorded in clear sound by the BIS-engineers. But this symphony also includes many parts of singing, and that's where my objections come. The choral parts are OK, but the soloists really aren't. I had to turn it of the first time I listened to it, take a short break and then begin again from the start. The vibrato and strain from just about every voice is extremely disturbing. This is most surprising since you're usually spoiled with good recordings from the BIS-label. You ought to get another version of this fine symphony. Solti has made a great version for Decca with just as great solo-singing as conducting, and Bernstein (though always being Bernstein) makes another almost as good version for DG. Both these are definately worth their money even if they would cost twice as much as this."
2,Author didn't seem to read the first 3 books carefully.,"I couldn't finish this book. I know that may make my opinion invalid to many, but I just couldn't.It was infuriating the way the author changed the mannerisms of many of the characters, including their grasp on the English language. One of the more prominent supporting characters went from speaking like this in the second book: ""Just because I am in union with you at the moment, it does not mean that I am delving into your innermost secrets, my sweet."" to THIS in the fourth: ""And if correct is the Bombay being, Being Clive? If led we are by secret Dungeonmasters, might they not also in strangeglowfireplace be?""I just can't justify spending more time on a series whose multiple authors seem to have no respect for the work of those who came before them. Yes, I get that he wants to make her more alien, but maybe he should have considered that it's jarring for the reader to have such major changes take place in characters that they've grown fond of."
5,What a Sweet Ride it is!,"I've been writing reviews for a lot of Belly stuff. They're usually long and descriptive. Not this time though. Buy this album! It is amazing! If you like 1990's alternative or just chicks who rock, this album is essential. There's great break-up, make-out and scream your lungs out songs. It's the best of everything. A few great Belly songs are missing but the album overall is a classic."
5,what a sweet ride it was...,"Belly was one of the bands i listened to every day when i first started getting serious about music. altho the band had a very short life, they never went bad.i recommend getting King before this one, or just buy this one and their two albums all at once."
5,Wowsers!!,"Worth it alone for the dreamy cover of ""Hot Burrito #1"".Burn your bibles and follow the dizzy words of Tanya Donelly, she won't lead you astray."
5,Incredible Live Recording,I never thought that it was possible for a recording to capture the spirit of a 38 Special live performance. I was wrong. This one does it. You won't find a better live album than this one!
5,Excellent!!!,"The last time I saw .38 Special was in '86 or '87. I bought this cd on a whim-I figured it to be a trip down memory lane. I was absolutely blown away! I forgot what a great live band .38 is. It's all here, ""Rocking Into The Night"",""If I'd Been the One"",""Hold on Loosely"". Van Zant never sounded better than he does on ""Rebel to Rebel"". Barnes is in great voice throughout the entire show. Danny Chauncey is a pleasant surprise-his guitar work, along with Barnes is flawless. It's all backed up with a great rhythym section. The only negative criticism I can offer is that it isn't a double cd. It would've have been great if songs like ""Teacher, Teacher"", ""Chain Lightning"", or ""Travelin' Band"" were included. This is a great live cd. After buying it, I replaced all of my .38 cassetes with cd's and caught the band twice last year. The band has obviously grown and will continue to do so."
5,If you're gonna.........,"..... buy a .38 Special album, this is the one for you. Ahem. If I may - L I V E R O C K A N D R O L L. With a cast of thousands of bikers. Does it get any better. Probably not.Spend the ten bucks, turn the CD player PAST 10 and ROCK the troopers. ;o)"
3,Gade is just good/symphony stinks,Gade's inoffensive violin concerto is run of the mill Romantic Era fare. Kontra does a respectful job. Don't expect a Shaham or Perlman rendition.What would you expect to come of a collaboration between two Scandinavian composers writing about public transportation through seabeds and mollusks? This pedantic exercise is a mess.I can only imagine that all 12 people who came to hear this delight ran home to study tunnel building under waterways and immediately gave up eating fish.
2,Too much sea food,"I am disappointed with this book. About 3/4 of the recipes are for sea food which is expensive when feeding a large party. I would highly recommend Hors D'oeuvres Revised (Hardcover)by Victoria Blashford-Snell, Eric Treuille. The book has not only savory recipes but also sweet and has do-ahead tips."
3,Extremely Detailed- Not a Quick Overview,"I'm a graduate student and bought the book for a class at the seminary that I attend. Even as a graduate student, the books' geography is way too detailed for a quick survey of the land. But, if you are looking for a very detailed, informative Atlas, then this is the book to buy."
5,The Moody Atlas of Bible Lands ([ACSM Map Design Competition...,"The Moody Atlas of Bible Lands ([ACSM Map Design Competition...excellent. Well done, thorough, easy to ready.Love it. Great buy!"
3,Sheaffer Valor Fountain Pen,"I love all the Sheaffer Pens for the most part. I do not like this particular one as well as others that I have. Theink seems to always be running out. I do like it, but perfer other sheaffers that I have."
2,What a disappointment...,"if you ordered this book after seeing Ms Hopkins recently on ""Simply Quilts"" and seeing her demonstrate the ""Kansas Dugout"" block and the ""Mississippi"" block and quilt (supposedly based on the Dugout block and this book). The book came today, and guess what? No pattern, picture, or diagram of the block or quilt ""Mississippi""! There are plenty of colored diagrams of her designs, but (as is true of many of her other books) woefully little in the way of instructions, sizes, yardages, etc. This is mainly a 47 page combination coloring book for her designs...and a ""new"" design for ""Barn Raising"". It is not, I believe, worth the price."
4,Works great for the price,"I purchased this armband carrier to fit my Creative:Zen M and it's working really well. Like others stated, one of the drawbacks is not being able to change the music easily but that hasn't been a big problem. I just have to be more careful in my music selection before I start working out. It stays in place on my arm, whether I'm running on the eliptical or doing weights in the circuit room. The player fits snuggly into the pouch and I'm never afraid it will fall off once it's on my arm. My only complaints are that it's not super comfortable on my arm for long periods of time and it's not very easy to adjust once it's on. I think if I had a smaller mp3 player it would probably be more comfortable but it serves it purpose nicely."
5,Love this armband!,"I purchased this for my husband to put his CC Wireless MP3 Player/AM/FM Radio in while he jogs. This unit is bigger than many MP3 players, but fits perfectly in the Tune Belt Armband. We are both very pleased with this puchase. I also love that it's washable."
4,Works well,I really like this product. I have searched far and wide for one that will fit my rio mp3 player and this one is perfect. It also fits my skinny arm!
2,miss leading picture,"The picture shown was very miss leading. From the discription I thought I was buying a pedometer, which I was searching for."
2,a little dissapointing,"I guess you can't expect much from a universal mp3 holder. But, I'll put it this way... if I didn't use a gift card to purchase it, I'd probably return it."
5,Simple Inexpensive and it works,"We use it with both our Iphone3G and Blackberry curve. Perfect - nothing fancy, easy on and off, easy to wash. Great value for the price. I could see if you have huge Mr. Universe arms you might have a problem, otherwise, best I've see out there based on reviews."
4,Pretty good,"I got this arm band for my regular sized G4 Ipod. It was the only arm band for Ipods on amazon that didn't have some bad reviews!I'm happy with my choice so far. The band stays on when I walk on the treadmill and do other exercises. The only thing I don't like is that it's hard to put the Ipod back into it once it's on and I remove the Ipod.Also, the band is adjustable like a belt instead of with velcro. I'm not sure it won't stretch out too much over time."
1,Waste of money,This crap does not work plain and simple. The name brand stuff may be expensive and you don't get much but at least it works. I do not know if these guys are lying about the concentration or if there is not any of the active ingredient at all but something is fishy about this product.
4,Exceptional,This CD is indispensable not only to lovers of Holmboe's music. The Metamorphoses are wonderfully evocative and enthralling. Recommended without reservation.
4,Traveler in a Strange Land,"Susan Orlean's new book is one more argument in favor of the theory that all writing is travel writing. Most of the pieces in My Kind of Place have appeared in The New Yorker Magazine and others. They cover a wide range of offbeat topics.Since these articles are all over the map, so to speak, you may end up picking and choosing. Some are very short and personal, others are longer and more journalistic. Some of my favorites were the piece on baby beauty pageants, in which Orlean brings out the rather creepy aspect of such contests very subtly; the taxidermy convention, also a surreal occasion; and a stay in Midland, Texas, a dusty oil town whose claim to fame is being the hometown of George W. Bush.Orlean's travels outside the States were also good, just not quite as interesting as when she explores the weirdness that exists in our own back yard."
2,Good writer; uninteresting topics,"I think Susan Orlean is a very talented writer, but a lot of the essays in tihs book left me wanting. I liked the essays about the social fabric of a particular place (such as her visit to Midland, Texas). Much less interesting to me were her essays about a grocery store, taxidermy convention,and beauty pageant, often in exhausting detail. For example, if you want to know everything about how a small supermarket appeals to a group of diverse customers, then this is the book for you. But I grew weary of her describing the delivery schedule, stocking schedule, customer complaints, managerial challenges, etc. You get the picture. Orleans can be fascinated by any topic, no matter how mundane. I am often described by friends as a very curious person, but even I could not get into a lot of these topics."
1,Does n't charge over 31%,"I bought this a month ago. In the initial days, it showed up at 100%, but later the battery charges only to a level of 31%. I am not sure if this a battery problem or the adapter. But if it is the adapter, why would it stop only at 31%? Anyways, I am disappointed with this as it s been just over a month and I have already issues.."
1,Do not purchase! This is a bad item and will not hold a charge,"I purchase this battery thinking it was a Dell original. Within one month it would not keep a full charge. Now after only a few months, it does not hold a charge at all. The reason I purchased the Dell Inspiron 8600 was for the long battery life (up to 5 hours). Best of all, there is no one to contact to discuss. These should be taken off the market."
