4,These are great!,I love these almost as much as my daughter does. The triangle shape keeps them from rolling on to the floor and under foot. (I can't tell you how many normal crayons I have broken by stepping on them.) The chucky size is also great.
3,get the regular crayola large crayons,"i teach art in the public schools and these were recommended to me by some collegues for very young children and those with handicaps... so i was excited to find them on amizon. my 18 month old son couldn't hold them right and it was actually easier for him to hold the regular primary sized crayola crayons. actually, for young children washable markers work better as a start, then pencils, then crayons later on when they are ready to start coloring in and can begin to control pressure. these pyramidal crayons may still be pretty good for children with disabilities, but thats a highly individualized situation: you just have to try it and see."
4,"Good so far, no need to buy","Went to the bookstore in the iuniverse website and searched for the book and hit ""browse before you buy"". I read the whole book there completely free. My eyes are red but I think I'll come back to it again."
2,wanted to like it...,"Yep, i bought it hoping for some self-discovery. I would have been more than satisfied with some simple take-home points to bring into everyday life. I wanted to like this book, and thought I would from the reviews on Amazon (generally fairly good, but they can be artificially inflated, as a NYT expose recently found). Not sure about what other people saw in this book. It was full of platitudes and other obvious and trite suggestions. Because I'm scientifically minded, I want to have a reason to believe the advice I'm being given, but the author's basic premises are unsubstantiated. Moreover, it was boring. BIG CAVEAT: I didn't finish the book, only getting half way through. Maybe it gets better?"
3,Haven't read it yet.,"But when I do glance at it...it's complexity sort of turns me off. Hate to say it, but I bought it because of it's cover."
4,"very wise, not a quick fix","Well i just finished the book, it gave me a very warm feeling, and made me feel more optimistic regarding our human evolution and where we're heading. My parents stole most of my energy, so i'm having a hard time lightening my shells. But yes it has given me a better understanding into my relationships, and the nature of insecurities. Now that i'm more aware from the book, i can see more of my problems, i just don't know what to do now . . . I think i got this book at precisely the right time in my development and it has clicked with me. I would recommend this book if your confused about why your relationships are so draining and want to understand human nature as a whole."
5,"If you actually read it, it is a great book.","[...] I took the advice of one reviewer and read the book online at the iuniverse site and found out that it's a real interesting book! So if you are confused about the mixed reviews like me and don't want to risk wasting your money, read the book online. It's free so even if you don't think it is good, you can at least find out for yourself without spending your own cash. But if you read it, you probably will find that it is very interesting. For me, the most interesting part was the last part of the book where they talk about analog and digital modes of consciousness, the subject-object split, and evolution. It made me feel like maybe we are actually evolving to something better. I also looked at the bookreviewclub site and they had a real review written by the people there. It was a very positive one."
3,"Useful, intelligent, but incomplete","This is a very interesting, intriguing book. It simplifies some ways of viewing interpersonal life. Shows you a judo of sorts that you can use with your interaction with others. Seems to verge on offering much more. But something is missing I think. Almost a great book, but that something that is missing.Lots of ways you want to use this life outlook to better your own, but there isn't quite enough info here. A very kind hearted view of living with other people. One we need more of in the world. It would greatly improve quality of life if this way of living were more widespread.Even though I am only giving 3 stars, it is a book everyone should read. I am hopeful that more might be forthcoming from this person in the future."
5,Excellent book for those who are ready!,"For people who are ready for a new stage in life beyond our everyday dualistic understanding of the world, this book is really quite fantastic. For the majority of people who are not ready for it, the contents of this book will not resonate in your hearts. This is also evident from the two-sided reviews of this book. If you are at the right stage, this book will seem very insightful. If you are not, it is just another psychology book. Of course the people who are not ready will deny this but that is how the mind works. We never want to think that we are not ready for something, especially when some other people are. This book explains this brilliantly if you are one of the people who are ready for it. Even if you aren't, it is OK. We are all in a constant process of development and we all develop at our own pace."
3,ok,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AFTER READING RECOMENDATIONS FROM OTHER READERS. THE BOOK WAS OK. IT HAD SOME INTERESTING POINTS OF VIEW THAT WERE WORTH READING. THE PROBLEM THAT I HAD WITH THE BOOK WAS THAT IT READ LIKE A PSYCHOLOGY TEXT BOOK. VERY DRY AND SCIENTIFIC WRITING. I KEPT EXPECTING TO SEE A QUIZ AT THE END OF THE CHAPTERS. NOT FOR THE CASUAL READER.
1,Sadly Disappointed,"Took this on trip of a lifetime to Japan. PV-DV203 didn't make it back alive. The miniDVs started popping out while recording and finally stopped recording altogether. Upon return, replaced PV-DV203 with the PV-GS15 and tried to run the miniDVs from the trip. Picture and sound quality terrible with a lot of skipping and poor auto-focus. Hoping PV-GS15 is an upgrade."
2,Bring on the grain....,The picture quality looks really good at 12 noon outside with no clouds but when you get it in a room with 60 watt light bulbs the picture gets really grainy... I ended up exchanging it for the sony TRV19. The TRV19 seems to have a cleaner and brighter picture.
1,Panalousy,"Okay, I bought this camera back in June and I only played with it a couple times. In August I went to Austria and visited a couple of landmarks and by the end of the day is was buggy. We were down in some mines and I guess it got moist because it said Dew Damage. Luckly for me I have a Panasonic dealer who sent it in for repair and I just got it back and now it eats tapes, you have to pry open the mini dv tape holder, and the record but is sticky."
5,"Functional, Ergonomical and Some Nice Features","This digital camcorder has some nice features for its price range, including the non-glare LED lighting. Stills are 1.2 megapixel interpolation on SD media. Overall great product, easy to use, compact and loaded with features. Panasonic has great products. It's a great product that has good features and terrific quality of video and sound. A must have and must worth of checking out."
2,Windows who?,"I bought a book once entitled ""Programming in C++"". As it turned out the book didn't have one ounce of C++. It was devoted entirely to C. ""Programming Microsoft Windows Ce.Net"" is the same story. There are no mention of classes or another other aspect of object oriented .net programming. The book spends all of 5 pages discussing the CLR. No. This book should have been entitled ""Programming Windows 3.1"". Oh. Oops. That book is already out there, so get that one instead!"
5,Star Trek,"I'm a Star Trek Fan, and was pleased with the ornament, it arrived timely and in great condition, looking forward to buying more."
4,Christmas gift,This was purchased as a gift for a person who collect star trek ornaments and they were missing this one. It looks great on the tree.Shipping was fast
4,An amazing--truly amazing--person,"A spine-chilling account of this great man's days in Budapest, followed by a rather tenuous and undocumented account of his horrors in the Gulag. Well written and gripping."
4,It was good but......,"It was good but did the heroine have to be so ugly? I was kind of sick of reading over and over how plain she was and actually she sounded downright ugly. Frizzy red hair, a nose with a dent on the end and covered with freckles kind of ruins the mood. Other than that, it was really interesting and held my attention. I really like this author and wish she would get off the vampire nonsense and write more historical fiction."
3,sexy and frustrating....,"I loved Beyond Innocence and loved the character of Merry Vance so I was glad for the sequel.Merry is a very strong willed person with clear ideas of what she does not want, marriage, and discovers being unconventional is not accepted in her world. So she devises a plan to ruin herself by running away to a notorious painter, Nic Craven, that will paint her nude.There are several twists and turns in this story that will suprise you and frustrate you. I personally kept on reading and got exasperated with the two characters wanting them to work this out and get on with it but I must admit that was part of the fun in this book.Also the sex is quite graphic and yet tender and loving. I did like this book and would recommend it. I would like to see another in this series perhaps a book about her brother Peter or her suitor Ernest."
5,An amazing read....,"Certainly not for the faint of heart! This book is an intricately weaved web of erotica, romance and manipulation. Watch out for the graphic and adventurous love scenes!"
4,"Sexy, romantic Regency","If what you're looking for is an engaging, slightly kinky, sexy Recency romance, then this duo is the best pair of books out there."
2,sex without chemistry,"Yes, there's lots of sex, although more is promised than delivered in this rather predictable book. The plot is unbelievable and while there's sex, there is no chemistry. I gave the author two stars for trying; I suggest that she read the earlier Susan Johnson books for the blend of porn and romance that most women seem to want [too bad Johnson's not writing like she used to!]."
2,Kind of a disappointment,"I bought this one on the strength of the other Amazon.com reviewers, and, my admiration for Emma Holly's Beyond Innocence, and some of her other books. But I was disappointed in Beyond Seduction. I thought the plot was kind of dragging along, held together only by love scenes and I hate a romance novel like that. I didn't find Merry or Nic appealing at all, as characters. Conversations that took place between them and all the book's other characters sounded fake or false. A romance novel has to have admirable characters and be held together by a good plot. This one was kind of all over the place, plot-wise and character-wise. Frankly I wonder if this was kind of rushed into print as a semi-sequel to Beyond Innocence, as Merry was a subcharacter in that novel? But in any case, the story did not appeal to me and it's a subpar effort from Emma Holly."
4,Wish it were longer!,"Beyond Seduction was a great book, I only wish it was a lengthier. Nicolas Craven was YUMMY and the plot was sweet and romantic. What more can a romance reader ask for?The love scenes in the book are spicier than most, so read them only if you are not easily shocked! As for me, I only wish Emma Holly churned out books faster....."
4,HOT! HOT! HOT!,"I don't write as many reviews as I should. However, I feel Ms Holly is getting better with each book she writes. The characters in this book are believable and interesting. Merry and Nic are both characters that you can care about. The relationship they have develops over time and deepens with each day. I really enjoyed this book. I recommend it highly."
1,This is not a book,This is an article from an anthropological journal. Google it and you can download it from Wiley. The article is good but should not be listed as a book.
4,Good information...albeit a little difficult to stick with,"The information is very good for the novice goat owner...just slightly dry. Stick with it, though, because knowledge is everything when starting a new venture with animals."
3,It's O.K.,"The history was the most interesting and informative section for me. I needed more practical information. What are the recommended worm medications? How often do you administer them? Are there any diseases we should inoculate against, and how often? Are there herbal or alternative treatments, and how are the treatment types rated with each other? Not only do I get anxious and depressed reading about all the diseases, when two of my goats got sick, their symptoms were not like anything at all in the book, so even the disease section is not comprehensive."
2,Mediocre,"I'm a fan of the highlander series since my childhood.Howerver i disaprove with the ethnic view in this movie.What i mean is... The only black person of (importance in this film is a perverted, evil sadist, played by Mario Van Peebles).Another American minority group represented in this film is the latin american gang that tries to rob the white ""hero"" (christopher lambert) On top of this there is a asian woman that acts as a prostitute. This reminds me of the rasistic history america have. And rises the question if that is a expression of white supremacy?"
4,/very helpful,"Even though I was not sent the complete order, when I contacted the company they responded immediately and were very helpful and accomodating. The woman admitted the ommission and took care of it right away and sent me the rest of the order. I will definitely use them in the future."
5,Splendid Pre-Trip review,I bought this book shortly before leaving to visit several of the gardens included. Beautiful color and black and white in it. Excellent text.
3,"Not bad, not great","Magnetic Rose - the best short on the DVD, by far. Great imagery, captivating storyline, wonderful imagination at work.Stink Bomb - Stupid. Totally unrealistic/unbelievable and not even funny. Waste of space on the DVD.Cannon Fodder - Got through about 10 minutes of it and fell asleep. Skipped through to the ending after I woke up, but didn't miss much.The DVD is worth it for Magnetic Rose alone, so I recommend buying it."
3,Memories,"Three short anime filmsThe first is too long but beautiful enough to say the film hd patience.The Second was funny and very interesting a great watch.and the Third was my favorite, so meaningful and powerful against a futuristic society where war is work (then again isn't it?)"
4,"Of the 3 video segments, 2 are phenomenal","'Memories' is a great anime that comprises three video shorts. The first two are very good, but the last video short is somewhat weak and not very interesting. The first video short, 'Magnetic Rose', is dramatic, poignant, and touching, and is in the style of the old Twilight Zone tv series. The second, 'Stink Bomb', has it's own unique gut-wrenching humor and drama and has a killer ending. I highly recommend this anime title."
5,Great!,I loved Stink Bomb! It's on the scale of the classic Twilight Zone episodes! Great story with a great ending! Everything else is so high quality that it really makes you appreciate animation when it's done well.
3,Timing belt,"Excellent quality at a reasonable price. The belt was missing orientation arrows. The repair manual states to install the belt with the arrows facing ""you"" (the installer). I installed the belt with the part number/labels facing me. I assumed that would be the right orientation. Besides, I really don't know why it's going to matter so much. Well, it's still running...I would have given 5 stars if it had the arrows..."
4,decent minidv camcorder for the money,"This ""southwestconsumer"" (sdclark12) wrote over 100 piece of reviews with exactly the same contents and rating against various Panasonic products. This is a person full of hatred towards Panasonic. His reviews have nothing to do with a particular Panasonic product."
4,Worth Your Time,"I'd advise only reading this if you're like me, you enjoy Philip K. Dick's writing, you've read a fair few of his books including 'Confessions of a Crap Artist', and you hope to read all his works (and steer clear of stuff like 'The Ganymede Takeover').'In Milton Lumky Territory' may not be as exciting and quirky a read as 'Confessions of a Crap Artist' but it is a good read nonetheless and it's a shame that this was languishing as a manuscript on one of Dick's bookshelves until after his death.It's set in the 50's, it has a purposeful main character in his mid-twenties who has that same horrible awareness of bad interpersonal situations that can be found in 'Confessions of a Crap Artist'. It's a good quality novel that you'll look back on and like."
4,Just love it! Prestige Lip Gloss,"I just love this lip gloss. It's longlasting, it's consistency is thick but not sticky on the lips, it plumbs a little not much but for the price you can't get a better deal."
1,Just grainy lip gloss,"This product didn't do anything for me, nothing more than average lip gloss, that is. The texture is grainy and coarse, I'm assuming that's from glitter, because it's very glittery. And it does give an warm burning feeling but it doesn't do any plumping whatsoever. The texture of the gloss will make you want to co Lnstantly rub your lips together, which may make them look fuller but that only lasts for a couple minutes. It also leaves a yucky residu on your lips after the gloss has worn off. It's like glue. The smell is alright, it's a cinnamon, spice type smell. Color is pretty but you may want to wear a sheer gloss over top bc it's not very smooth"
1,soup is fine but the price is crazy,This is available at most supermarkets for $4 or less. Buyer be warned if you pay this much for one bag of soup mix.
3,Not what you think it is,"These balls may tough and an ok toy in general, but the name is very deceiving. I purchased three, 3.5"" and one, 5"" ball. Simply put, there's no ""Boingo"" in these balls as they barely bounce off the ground. They DO NOT change directions or act erractic in any way, shape, or form. All they do is make a rattling type of noise as there is something spinning inside the ball. If I had knew this beforehand, I would never have purchased 4 of them."
4,Folding footrest,I received the footrest as Christmas present from my daughters as I fly internationally several times a year. It really help a lot and very easy to carry. The only small thing maybe improved is it is a little slippery when you set it on the floor but other than that i am happy with the product and will recommend to people who has petite size as me.
4,review,"very easy to use -- easy to carry with you if you have a big purse! you have to make sure the metal ""wings"" snap out to support the two ""legs"", or your stand will fall down!"
2,I hoped it would be great,"Like some of the reviewers, I'm also short, 5'3"" and have trouble sitting at business conferences. Usually at hotels, the chairs were designed for men. Too tall for me. So I bought one of these folding footrests. It made my handbag heavy. When it's already stuffed with the things you pick up at a conference, heavier isn't a plus. But most important, it was wobbly, especially on carpeted hotel floors. Instead of adding to my stability, I was clenching my back to keep my foot steady on top of it. Two feet on it was not good at all. For me, an error buy. But maybe that's just me."
1,Ridiculous product,This product is ridiculously small. One Foot barely fits on it much less two. It was even small for my child's two feet. The metal bars that are supposed to hold the legs upright flip closed with the smallest amount of jiggling. I do not recommend this product.
4,foot rest,"since I am short, this foot rest has come in handy when sitting at my desk, or other places where my feet don't touch the floor."
2,Too small and it slides on plastic carpet protector,I am not too crazy about it. They need to make it wider and also install rubber under the legs so that it does not slide
3,It's pretty small.,"I know it's marketed as a travel-size, folding, fit-it-in-your-purse jobber, and since it shows a tiny little lady in the picture, I can't be too mad at the size, but this thing is almost too small to put both of my feet on at the same time. I spend most of the time bending down to reposition it as it is pretty light and flimsy, and gets knocked over very easy (locking bar aside). The plastic is thick and sturdy, but it's almost insulting that this can be marketed as a foot rest. It's way to big to fit in your pocket, for the record. Unless you have huge coveralls or something."
2,oh dear...,"As a massive Star Wars fan I hate to write this, but the fall of the sith empire is seriously below par, a jerky script with no characterisation, art that gets gradualy worse as it goes along and a plot that seems rushed and stunted. Kevin J Anderson is capable of much better work. If you want to complete the tales of the jedi set, fine, if not try the Freedon Nadd uprising or any of the X-wing: Rouge Squadron series."
4,I really liked it except for the part about the duck,I really liked it and enjoyed the pictures but whats all this talk about a duck
2,This album is great if you like arena-rock cliches.,"This guy can obviously emote, but what's the point? This piano/guitar rock doesn't have the power of Journey or the vulnerability of Ben Folds Five. He doesn't make the listener want to care about his subjects"
2,Buyer beware - excessive shipping,"I've seen this product in a showroom, retailing $59-$69, which is also too expensive for the quality. Screens are rather flimsy, but functional. However, these screens do NOT weigh 70 lbs as advertised. Note the incredible ""deal"" of $14.88 for the screens ... PLUS $69.95 for shipping! Not such a great deal."
3,"Well, this was interesting","Not as good as I had thought. It was a low budget film so ofcourse nothing spectacular came out of it. The lesbian storyline was kinda rushed, they go from meeting at a club to living together? Then it looked like the Dom and her friend were going to get together, then there's the script and pressure to quit the business. There is just too much going on in the movie that they leave parts out. The Lesbian couple is a movie on it's own...well could have been there as no need for all the other junk. Some scenes are pointlessI gave it 3 stars because I like some of the cast members I think they did a decent job trying to carry this film and make it close to watchable. One thing I learned was that redheads are pretty cute!"
2,"Sorry, but this one isn't very good...","I saw this one at the bookstore and was just leafing through it and nothing really caught my eye, but I decided to come here and get some opinions on it to see if it was worth a second look; it wasn't surprising what I found. I went back and looked again to check on the complaints and sure enough, the photos in this book are pretty bad. It is true that they are set at odd angles and that the cakes themselves...many of them do appear to look sloppy.I didn't see any cake designs that interested me anyway.I am grateful to have this site to check up on books (like this one) and save my money although I do hope the author tries again with something better-just to balance out this dog of a book."
3,Enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book,"I read this book in one sitting. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book, but strongly disliked the last 1/3. I agree with the ""overstuffed plot"" and ""wobbly denouement"" assessment of the professional reviewer above."
2,I beg to differ...,"The subject of funeral art is fascinating. Unfortunately, that was the only thing about the book I found interesting. There was absolutely no character development. I found myself slogging through the book anxious for it to end. This just did not work for me."
4,An unusual premise!,"So many mysteries are solved by hardened, anguished detectives (whether formally employed or not) living in bleak cities. Looking for murders that happen in idyllic settings or nerdy professors who can also solve crimes? That's what you get in O' Artful Death. Sweeney (the protagonist) is still anguished in her own way but much less cyncial than your average crime-solver due to her sheltered place in academia. Plus, if you are looking for an interesting niche in American history to explore, Taylor's descriptions of the culture of early arts colonies are fascinating. It's made me curious to see the works of American artists active in arts colonies over the past several centuries. Recommended for front porch reading with a glass of wine after work."
5,"About a Prof, By a Prof","What a terrific read! Great characters, atmospheric setting, manages to capture the feel of the area as well as the academic environment. Great plot twists...can't wait to read another of her books."
3,The picture that was shown was not the same as the product received,"Amazon showed the wrong picture, therefore the product was not as expected. Two items were missing. This was not the sellers fault but Amazon's . I was very disappointed!!"
3,"Great deal at this price, but bag is big for the HYBRID Hitachi","I figured if I bought a spare battery and 3 blank mini-DVDs separately, it would have cost the same as this bundle. So its like getting the Hitachi bag for free. Great value. The bag is a little on the big side, considering the small size of the Hitachi Hybrid (HDD/DVD) camera I have. But you can fit alot in it I guess. Only has one main compartment with a padded divider in there, and one small outside pocket, so you cant get that organized. The Hitachi manual is so huge (they print 3 languages all in one book) that it wont fit in the bag, which is a bummer cause now I will lose it."
3,campy apocalyptic fun,"Conceptually it's a mishmash of half-baked pseudo-theology, and the semi-coherent climax pretty much defines the term 'deux ex machina'. But whenever the film flatlines under the weight of its leaden pretenses and lousy dialogue, alien iguana Christopher Walken show up to rescuscitate it, much like his character Gabriel raises the dead so they can drive him to his next appointment. He gets most of the best lines, though Adam Goldberg as one of his rotting zombie-chauffeurs, and Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer himself get in a few zingers as well. Eric Stolz is affecting too as God's doomed errand-boy Simon. The two romantic leads are inert by contrast, and on re-viewing this film I found myself fast-forwarding through their scenes. The gargoyle-like crouch adopted by the angels is one of several nice stylistic touches to this otherwise rather low-budget affair, but in the end it's Walken's fascinating goth-camp performance that will keep grown-ups watching."
3,bought it for...,"...viggo. being lucifer. chris walken is always a treat in his horror/thrillers, too. what made it a 3: no extras, and the horrible dialogue."
2,Disappointing,"It's not a horrible movie, but after all the good things I heard about it, like it was one of Christopher Walken best movies, I can only be disappointed. So yeah, Mr Walken is great in this movie, but you only see him for about 20 minutes. The rest is just boring. I'm not the kind of person who needs explosions and special effects to be entertained, but there really is not much going on. The plot isn't deep and it's stretched over an hour and a half.I wonder how that movie got three or four sequels. I heard the quality got worse every time... I'm glad I only got this one.Well, if you want some great Walken, get the Kings of New York or the Deer Hunter"
2,Prophecy II is better,"I have seen one and two, and by far two was more constructed and thoughtout. I suggest rent it before you buy it, so you won't be disappointed."
4,Prophecy,"The package was received with the product inside.This item was given out for Xmas, so I have NO real idea if the product works or not."
2,Entertains...for about five minutes,"Confusing, tedious supernatural horror film about evil arch-angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) trying to create a second hell (or something) by using the soul of a psychotic general from a Korean war...think. Characters too silly, mythology too thick and story too boring. Only note worthy aspect is Viggo Mortensen as Lucipher. Followed by two sequels."
2,Low budget misfire,"Christopher Walken plays himself once again. Viggo Mortensen has a powerful brief appearance. Virginia Madsen has nothing much to do. Elias Koteas proves he's a good actor. And that's all.This 1995 movie is a low budget production with an ample premise, but this premise will dissapoint as soon as he movie begins to roll, so weak and full of holes it proves to be."
1,Had Potential,"This movie had great potential. A film about an Angel angry with God for favouring Humans over Angels, sounds great. But unfortunately, it fails to deliver. The movie places too much emphasis on Christianity, Church and Jesus. This gives the impression that the film is primarily targetted at Christians, while ignoring everyone else. Not good."
1,Worst movie I've seen in a long time,"You have to be kidding me, the acting, plot, everything about this so called movie made me ill. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! I can't believe that people got paid from this trash. What a mess."
1,the horror,"I should've known from the first unintelligible voice-over and the quick cutaway to some feathered figure that this was to be a mind-numbing waste of time, but no, no , I had to keep watching since Walken was in it. Look, buy it your even rent it at your own peril: there are episodes of Gomer Pyle, USMC with more coherent editing, narrative integrity, horror, and theological depth. What the hell was Walken thinking?"
4,he may learn to like us,"When is Walken less thn excellent?In this I expected little,but Walkens' character ,if that's the right word,makes this worth staying the way through.It's not good as the video he danced in(5),but I say try this ind call me when this unholy terror is settled."
5,Walken is a true Master!!,"A friend rented this in college and, being a ""cult-movie"" freak, I knew I had to watch. I was addicted. In a time when our cherrubic views are closer to ""Touched by an Angel"" and Clarence from ""It's a wonderful life"", it's a nice change to see the true nature of these creatures. Walken is excellent, Mortensen is the best Lucifer I've seen, and the rest of the cast only accentuates the film. Definately a must-see for any film lover."
4,GREAT MOVIE,"IT MIXES SUPERNATURAL AND ACTION.WALKEN IS EXCELLENT,EVEN IF HE LOOKS LIKE HES WEARING AWIG."
5,mind bender,"helluva movie, christopher walken can do no wrong, but this movie is an excellent combination of theological ""what ifs"". any more details would spoil the plot, but needless to say it's worth buying if you're into movies with neutrally dogmatic premises."
3,Entertaining quasi-religious movie,"Walken and Viggo pull out awesome characters in this semi-religious film about angels at war with each other. Low-key special effects make us focus more on performances, which is a good thing I think. I am a sucker for religious films like this an Constantine (which I think is a slightly better film).Over all I think they did a decent job here creating a decent story with some great actors...making an all around entertaining movie."
4,Worth your while movie,"The Prophecy plays of the Catholic Church beliefs. Which is a good thing. You find Gaberial, one of the archangels of heaven, searching for a evil soul of a General in the military. Which ends up in a little girls' body. And there is where the plot takes place. Fighting for this soul and the saving of the human race."
4,Walken Makes A Good Angel,"With Christopher Walken in this film, I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised by it too. Walken plays the Angel Gabriel bent on eradicating the human race. Eric Stoltz portrays the Angel Simon and Elias Koteas plays a seminary student turned cop, both out to stop Gabriel. Gabriel's plan is to acquire the soul of the most evil man on earth, and use it to eradicate the human race, allowing God to love angels above all others. The devil drops in for fun at one point too. The Prophecy is written and directed by the gent that wrote The Highlander, so you know that the story will keep you interested. All in all this is a good film, not the best, but Walken fans won't be disappointed. He acts in his typical fashion, and delights his fans in doing so."
3,dew detected message on panasonic,"I found a trick to go around it , well i am not sure how long this will last but for now it did the trickI have used a paint tape, a blue masking tape , and covered the front of the camcorder where the microphone is, because i assumed that they have put their moisture detector overthere, and in fact after sealing the speaker/microphone holes in the front, the camcorder is back to working fine even after removing the tape --- good luck"
1,Dew Warning a common problem,"Purchased this item two months ago. I used it four times and now it shows a ""dew detected"" warning. The camera then shutdown and no longer works. I did some research and found this is a common problem, not only with this model, but several other Panasonic products. The problem is due to a detective module that Panasonic uses and the only way to fix it is a repair bill of $150. I have tried several times to contact Panasonic, but have received no response. Until Panasonic upgrades their parts and customer service I would buy elsewhere."
1,dew detected.. among other problems,"the ""dew detected"" sign is another way of Panasonic saying that the camcorder needs ""servicing"" and that you will have to send it in to be fixed for a price of at least $80. There are TRILLIONS of forums on the lack of reliability of this camcorder.. so DON'T BUY IT.. or any other camcorder from Panasonic.. because they're just unreliable."
1,Garbage (DEW DETECTED),"If I could give a rating of 0 I would. I had this camera for about 3.5 months and maybe 30 minutes of recordings. I got the ""DEW DETECTED"" message and this camera has been useless since then. I would not recommend this camera to anyone. Save your money."
3,"Good, but Broke after 1.5 years","It had been a good camera, but recently, the cassette compartment won't close. It makes a funny clicking sounds and does not close. 1.5 years seem a little short for reliability."
2,Good for a few years then...,"At first the PVDV103 seemed like the best camcorder. Then after 2 years it started to fall apart. First, the battery had some problems. The battery would charge then after 10 min. of filming, it would show that 1/2 of the battery was dead. It would then quickly go dead. Other times, it would just be fine.Also, the progressive feature sometimes turnes itself off, which can be annoying. I am also not as impressed with the image quality as I was 2 years ago. The viewfinder color quality is also very poor.Overall, without those problems, the PVDV103 is just okay. For the money you pay you could get a better camcorder."
5,Good Product!,"I haven't used this one yet, but this is a replacement for another one that was broken. It is a well made product and saves time."
3,More episodes produced,Wish there were more episodes of this series for sale. Especially of the second and third seasons.
3,A little help?,"Can someone please write a *useful* customer review describing the actual contents of the tape, please? Stating that the *show* is ""awesome"" or so-and-so is ""hot"" tells us *nothing* about the quality of the transfer itself, or the material included. Is this the pilot? The first several episodes? Several random episodes? It's certainly *not* the entire series; that wouldn't fit on a single VHS tape."
2,Rick Steve's Spain and Portugal,"I just returned from a trip to Spain, accompanied by Rick Steves and Lonely Planet. Rick's book was a disappointment, for I do enjoy his television series on PBS. The book was very weak on any type of usable maps or directions to important sites, which is mandatory in Spain. I found his warnings on the dangers of Morocco, especially Moroccan cuisine, to be unwarranted and a detriment to our enjoyment of our day in Morocco. We tried a couple of restaurants he recommended, without success, and switched to Lonely Planet's recommendations for the remainder of the trip if we needed help. His commentary is always enjoyable but the concrete information you need to find your way around is definitely lacking."
2,I guess you get what you pay for...,The feathers are poking through like crazy. It doesn't smell like some cheap featherbeds do. Buy at least 2 featherbed and pillow covers or you are gonna get scratched up by the feathers!
2,Not one of his better efforts,"Ah Stephen, what have you done? I found this book mostly disappointing. Yes it does come together in the end so to speak but the end could have come sooner with the elimination of about one third of the entire novel. Although Regina's story sets the background there was just way too much of it and it could have been handled in much shorter form. I also didn't like how Daniel appeared to be a key part of the story and then he vanishes, showing up for a cameo at the end. Throw in the fact that young Daniel just happens to be able to hack in to hospital computers and what not and well, it's all a little silly.S.B. is a brilliant author but this is certaintly nowhere near his usual efforts. 2 stars."
2,Not Baxter's best work,"I'm a big Stephen Baxter fan. I've read most of his books and this one lacks the flow his other books have. He doesn't tie the story together very well. Perhaps he will do it in the other two books but rather than leaving you in a state of suspense it makes you feel about 1/3 of the book is wasted paper.Normally, I can't put his books down until I'm finished. I had to force my way through this book because I had already wasted money on it.It wasn't a great story and it seemed all rather pointless. It wasn't insightful and didn't make you think like his other books do.Also, there were parts that felt like he was trying to pull a Dan Brown."
3,Not bad... Not great,"My response to the Historical Racism insanity is to take yourself less seriously. You'll get a stroke at that rate. I mean... dang.The story dragged. It was almost a physical struggle to finish the book, George Poole is just a loser, a nowhere man who is wandering through life and is so devoid charisma he may as well be dead. Regina is just unsympathetic. With those two main characters even the greatest plot would be as slow as molasses on Vermont winter day."
3,Mixed,"Very very slow, but very very good. Sometimes Baxter's books feel like they were written in a rush; not this one. I get the feeling that it was very well crafted. However, it is excruciatingly slow in spots. I borrowed this book 3 times from the library and was unable to get past the first chapter each time and had to return it when it was due. Finally they gave a used copy of the book away and I snagged it, given 2 months, I could finally slog into the book enough to be able to finish it.Overall though I would say that this is excellent writing."
4,Well worth sticking through the slow bits,"This was actually the first book of Baxter's that I had read, and while I'll agree with the previous reviewers that the book did drag in places, I felt it well worth my time and money to make it to the ending. I actually really appreciated his efforts at characterization and description, although I did feel this came through much better in the ancient weave of the story than in the modern.A friend summed up what he thought as the main reason why many of Baxter's fans weren't as fond of this book as his others -- unlike the other Baxter books, my friend labeled this one as ""girl science fiction"". I can't say whether or not that is true -- but I am without a Y chromosome myself, and was drawn to this book even though I've never felt an urge to read any of his other books (even after thumbing through them)."
1,Definitely Not a Page-Turner,"I've been a big fan of Stephen Baxter's work over the years, and much admired his best novels, like Titan and Voyage and Moonseed. He has been one of the best novelists to carry on the tradition of good, solid, interesting, hard sci-fi. But I am about 300 pages into Coalescent and can find little to recommend it. The historical characters are barely two-dimensional and the modern ones little better. The two alternating stories that make up Coalescent have too little intrinsic interest to sustain the reader's attention. The only reason to slog through Coalescent is if you intend to read the two promised follow-on novels that make up the trilogy, as it doesn't generate much interest of its own. Baxter has become one of the most prolific sci-fi writers, but I think Coalescent shows he is now spreading himself too thin."
3,superfluous,"I have to say that for the most part I really enjoyed this book. Stephen Baxter is a wonderful scientist at heart with the street smarts to dumb it down a bit. The best way to describe Baxter is a Hard-Science Fiction writer, according to Wikipedia. Meaning that he uses hard scientific fact to back up his plot.This book got pretty violent near the end, but I can't wait to read the next one.This book would have been a five star book, if it wasn't for the fact that most of it was about a girl named Regina from ancient Rome. It wasn't sci-fi at all. It was alt-history, or whatever you call it. Baxter still makes this part extremely interesting and profound and fun to read. I just would have liked it more in another book. As the title says, it was MOSTLY superfluous. Most of the book was about Regina. Halfway through the book, I started skipping those chapter all together. I do, however see myself going back to it. It was really well written and detailed and interesting. Just not sci-fi."
2,"Please, can't this just end?","By and large I've enjoyed previous books by this author, but this has a serious disappointment. The plot, or rather the combination of plots, is chaotic and simply not riveting. The bulk of the book is given over to a historical novel, but it's not historical enough to really be educational, not rich enough to be gripping, and it simply doesn't mesh well with what should be the main plot line.The writing style is fine but overall the plot just doesn't feel like it works and the characters don't really win over either our empathy, compassion or hatred.SInce I've like the author's work in the past, I held out hope for a satisfying merging of the plot lines long after I should have given up on the book. Let's just say I wasn't satisfied. It's hardly the worst book I have ever seen, but it's one of the least satisfying books I have actually stuck with from cover-to-cover, partly due to high expectations from the author."
2,Piano sounds horrible,I bought this piano for my 2 year old she loves to sing and dance but the sound is horrible the keys don't stay up and the bench is not sturdy so when she sits down she immediately falls off. This was not worth 100.00.
3,It's a problem that the hardware they include isn't complete,"This is an excellent concept, but it is unforgivable that you need to take a trip to the hardware store to get washers and bolts that work."
4,Good gift for my hippy gf,she loves keeping flowers in her room but they always wither away and dont last forever.and now she can keep her flowers forever
3,"Not ready out of the box, go to the hardware store","My daughter just received this for her birthday. The set is fine and she will have fun with it, but it is not ready to go out of the box. It does not come with the washers that the instructions call for so you'll need to go to the hardware store. While you are there get some wing nuts and maybe bolts too because the wing nuts are so poorly made they can't be used. One had no threads at all and the threads on the other 3 are so bad they are useless. Also the threads on the bolts are poorly made. I probably messed one up before I realized the wing nuts were bad but the other three have questionable threads that may damage a good wing nut. I'll find out at the hardware store tomorrow.Update: Ended up needing new bolts as well so spent $2.15 plus tax for nuts and bolts. I have some old washers in the garage I can use."
4,Neat product,"My 8 year old received this gift for Christmas and was excited that SHE got to paint the actual flower press. We pressed poinsetta leaves (because they're so big) and were pleased with the results. The kit comes with art supplies to get you started making your pressed flowers into cards, bookmarks, etc... Very nice kit for the price and a great gift to spark imagination and crafty fun!"
3,Great item if it wasn't defective,"This is a great item! Bought it for a gift for my daughter's birthday. Unfortunately, the nuts/bolts in the one we got were stripped so you could not screw it down tightly to press the flowers. Frustrating as two sides would not screw at all. We had to skip the screws and just put heavy books on the top to press it down. Kind of defeats the purpose of ordering the set. However, we still made it work and pressed some lovely flowers. Just wish companies had better quality control."
2,"A book to borrow, not buy","What I liked about this book was the fact that the hero did not have a title, and therefore not many funds. What I did not like was that he was an alcoholic. Why must the poor man always be a junky? He disgusted me, but the persistence of the heroine kept me reading it until the end."
4,It's not that bad!,i liked it a lot all that i thought that wasn't supposed to be is that he shouldn't have done with her the 1st time other than that i enjoyed reading it
2,Very Disturbing 1994 novel,Vixen by Jane Feather took the reader down some very dark paths. Chloe is a 17 year old women who is placed in Sir Hugo care as his ward. He knew her mother and had killed her father in strange cult dual. Chloe's brother wants her to marry his step-son so he has get her money and can use her in a Horrific sexual ritual. I just finished the book and still feel a little sick.
1,I did not like this book at all,This book was really awful. I did not like the heroine nor the hero. How can he sleep with her constantly while planning to marry her off? And how can she permit him to treat her that way? I felt that both the characters were weak and dislikeable. Very dissatisfying. I've read one of her other books before and I was disappointed but then I decided to give her another chance and was disappointed again. I won't buy another one.
1,"Title could have been ""Rubbish""",Unlikeable heroine who is not believable. Unlikeable hero who is so tormented by his sexual past that he readily plunders his 17 year old ward. Story just doesn't work. Haven't finished the book......not likely to.
3,Pretty Girls being Pretty Unrealistic,"This movie was ok. I was good to see young Pam Grier`s baseball bat legs and to meet the strong, sexy silent ""Bodine"" (that name? yea right?) This movie was over the top in a 70s way I guess but was much more tasteful than it needed to be. It has a funny ending."
5,This set the WIP standard...,"OH YEAH! This is the film which set the standard for the women-in-prison genre. The Big Doll House has everything you could possibly need if you are WIP junkie: cat fights (one even takes place in the mud), group showers, sadistic guards, scantically clothed gun toting babes, lesbianism, torture, and Pam Grier. OH YEAH!"
5,GREAT Resource for ESL!,"I had heard of Jass Chants, but until I bought this CD, I did not understand why Jazz Chants could be useful for teaching ESL. There are over 50 Jazz Chants on this CD, of every type, useful for nearly every level of English. They are fun, clever--some are humorous, too. This is a terrific resource for ESL teachers. Good for lessons, for short activities, and for inspiration for your own Jazz Chants."
3,did not meet expectation,"Information therein is personal experience. There may be other reason(s) why instructors are allegedly unhappy other than professional recongnition, indeed."
3,"Good backpack, good price.","This is a good backpack for the price I paid. It may not be as big as I would have liked, and I had a little trouble fitting my laptop into it (only 15""), but overall I am satisfied. The material seems to be of good quality and I really like the padded glasses pouch. This is probably ideal for a college student who rides a bike or skates to class, given that it has a skateboard strap on the back."
4,Delightful!,"I found this CD after seeing an illustration in The New Yorker promoting their upcoming concert there and decided, ""What the heck."" This is a fantastic CD. Uneven, yes (the English language songs are too ""deep"" for me). Gratifying, most certainly. I am a huge R.E.M., Sleater-Kinnery, Bruce Springsteen fan. This music is harmonic, different, memorable, fun, interesting -- and just damn good. I've bought all the ""Best of 2002..."" CDs listed by the critics. This surpasses Beck, and ranks up there with Elvis Costello's 2002 CD, and rivals Wilco on my chart of #1s. Try this band. I'm interested in what they do next."
1,The strap rubs,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, since everyone raves about the shoes and seem to be happy. I feel like maybe there's something wrong with me. The shoes are beautiful, but the thong strap is too wide for my feet and it started hurting. I used them two days around the house and ended up returning them. I wanted them to fit so bad because they are very pretty shoes. They do run small, I am 8.5 and since they don't come in half size, I had to order a 9."
1,Save your money!,If you want the examples and photos in this B&W book in color then you have to print out the book's 136 pages from the pdf file on the CD. Of course you pick up the costs in paper and ink and the wear and tear on your printer. WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!
1,Disappointing,"This, like other Dennis Curtin books, have way too much boilerplate ""generic"" information while not covering the specific camera sufficiently. There are e-books and other books out there that are far better. I do admire his ability to ""get away with"" publishing these books for this kind of money!"
1,Doesn't teach you anything D-70 specific,"Most of this book is good for someone who has never taken a photograph with a digital camera. It is pretty useless for an experienced photographer that wants to learn the Nikon D70. The same information is on the quick start card, and easier to find.Save your money"
1,Not very helpful,This is nothing more than a variation on the instruction manual. A waste of money - I feel ripped off and its not worth returning because I live outside USA
2,Shoes did not fit.,"When the shoes arrived, I tried them on... well, TRIED to try them on. I had to check the size on the shoe to make sure it was correct. I could not even get my foot all the way in. I was surprised because I bought a different pair of Rampage shoes that fit perfectly. I think the third strap is too tight for my foot as I couldn't get past that one. I'll be returning these."
3,"Super cute, but...","I purchased these shoes to wear in a wedding. First of all the sizing was almost perfect but a bit on the narrow side. They pinch the top of my feet just a little. However, I was wearing them for several hours with very little discomfort. They are actually getting more comfortable the more I break them in. Secondly, the color was not as bright as the web site showed, but still very nice. Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase."
3,Shoe Review,"Shoes are pretty much as pictured. No real cushion. No back ankle/heel support. Simple. Nice, bright color."
2,Very poor &#65533; not a great Travel Book,"This is the first book I've read by Jenni Diski, and I'm told it's not typical of her work. Certainly this was disappointing. It's not a conventional travelogue; in fact after 70 pages (25% of the book) she still hadn't got on the train!Throughout she shows a brief insight into the personality of a dozen fellow passengers, but spends more time describing her problems gasping for a cigarette - hasn't she heard of nicotine patches?In 8 lines (lines, not pages) she dismisses the whole journey from Portland Oregon to Sacramento to Denver to Albuquerque - and she doesn't even mention Nevada & Utah. Was she asleep the whole time? Then Arizona to New York via New Orleans vanishes in a dozen pages with 2 anecdotes. Was she bored? I'm surprised this won the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award?I love travelling around America, but anyone could make it more exciting than this."
2,Not Satisfied!,"I've tried many different types of powdered shock for our above ground and this is just another one that does not hit the mark. It doesn't completely dissolve and what does dissolve, takes lots of time and shaking in another container of water!Save yourself lots of hassles and purchase liquid shock locally!"
1,"It is effective, but the odor is a bigtime deal breaker.","This shock is a Trichlor shock, which is not the typical calcium hypochlorite shock you find in most pool stores. I thought I'd give it a shot because it was on Amazon making it convenient, and it wasn't that expensive.Though it did shock the pool effectively, the odor of this product literally took my breath away and also gave me a rapid heartbeat on both occasions I applied it, and I was using a dust mask made for harmful materials + safety glasses. Both during and shortly after application this product emits noxious fumes. You can also smell the product at a lesser intensity for some time after application.While it is effective and cheap, I would never recommend it as its odor is noxious and I had to struggle through using the 5-pack."
5,no words need,amazing the first track alone absorbs you and takes you away sublime.a big thank you to amazon did not know about this record till they recommend it.again thanks many happy times to look forward too.
3,Average Book,This is an average book. But I liked the Distributed Algorithms by Nancy Lynch better. It is a much better presented book that this one though most of the material covered is the same give or take a few. Over all a good book worth the money but there are better books.
5,simply fascinating,"This book has so much detail in such few chapters. This story tells how Truman was first left to stay at Jenny's house..Also featuring the special tree house, the bone fence and the Sunday dinners. All these stories were wonderful. I've never read such interesting, real detail about Truman's life..this book is a must have for every Capote fan. Way to go Marie"
4,Excellent portrait of the South,"The reviews of this book vary widely from Capote fans that treasure every shred of information to those that feel the book recycles known information to others critical of the co-author. I am a Capote fan and do treasure information on Truman. The book is short but I found it well written and fascinating. The text also captures the Southern frame of mind so common among those raised in the South (as I was). In addition, the hardcover is an attractive book and will stay on my shelf for years to come. It has a high quality binding; the dust jacket and interior are handsome and well made. Given the price, not only is it a fine volume for Capote fans but it is a good value."
1,REHASH,This book is simply a rehash of information which has already been published. I am a big fan of Marie Rudisill's and loved FRUITCAKE and SOOK'S COOKBOOK. I advise she work on her own and not coauthor with Simmons again--her books with him just don't allow her wit and humanity to show through.
3,Mr David Viner fails to live up to mass hype!,"As you can see, i still gave the album an ""OK"" rating, because...that is what this album is....JUST ok. Mr. David Viner seems like the kind of artist i could appreciate, slightly off the path style-wise and interesting. (more than a few comparisions to Jonathan Richman) Upon giving this albums many spins, it just never fully takes off like it should. Not to say the album is terrible because it does have some solid tracks, i was just expecting a very high quality album based off of various fans and it hasn't shown itself to be that as of yet.Not bad, just not as good as i would've hoped."
1,Leaky,"Gave these to my folks for Christmas. They're colorful and seem to attract the hummers. But they leak like crazy--so much that ants became a problem. We tried a number of solutions to limit the leaking, but I think it's just a bad design. After a few frustrating months, they were taken out of service."
2,Disappointed,I loved the feeders but was disappointed to open the box and find one of the glass balls was broken.
1,"If It Was Free, It Would STILL Cost Too Much","This is the first book in the World War 2 category that I have not been able to finish. It is horribly written, edited poorly and incredibly dull and lifeless. The author uses the same catch-phrases and descriptive terms over and over and over again, focusing on only 3 or possibly 4 ways to try and describe completely different things. As far as the editing goes, if you can stand spelling errors every page or 2 then you can over look that, but unfortunately, I can't do that.Avoid this book at all costs."
1,Barely One Star,"Both my daughter and I have this phone set and the same thing has happened to both of us. They worked just fine for a few months, then the keypads stopped working. I've actually got the base and three handsets, and two of them have keypads that won't work. The 3, 6 and 9 are dead on one phone, and you have to press hard and hold them down on the other -- it's like they don't make a connection. I can't find a way to take the handset apart to try to fix it, either. It's also very hard to cradle on your shoulder, and when you do, your chin hits the ""volume down"" button. I've had my set for 1 year and my daughter has had hers for 9 months, and we're both going to have to get new phones soon. Unfortunately, I won't be buying any more of these."
2,Good voice quality. Terrible Keypad,"After about 1 year of having used these units I can say that the voice quality is very good. The display on one of the units has gone bad. I can't recognize the characters on it anymore as a lot of pixels are not displayed.The keypad on one of the units is pretty bad. Sometimes when I press the keys they don't work at all. Then when I press the key hard, the key gets registered twice. This is very unpredictable and annoying when you are trying to dial a number or entering digits for an automated voice response system."
1,Don't buy this AT&T phone,"As other reviewers have reported, the keypads on these phones start malfunctioning 6-12 months after purchase. The keys become sluggish - almost non-responsive - and then if you push really hard, the number gets entered twice since the key then bounces. Terrible phone. Stay away from this turkey."
1,Beware - this phone is garbage,"As reported here and on other sites, the keypads stop working on these phones after 6-12 months. I have 2 that broke just after the warranty period. I'll never buy another AT&T product."
4,Good phone but one issue worth noting...,"I have had these phones for a few years now. They are excellent phones but with one issue. I use them with Optimum Online (cable phone service).The good news - solid build, good features, clear display, easy to use. Our package consisted of master phone and 'slave'; only one phone needs to be connected to the phone outlet. The other is connected wirelessly. Nice to hold in the hand. Reliability has been good.Bad News - there is an intermitent cutting out in sound when using the phone. Its widely reported on the internet and is clearly a common problem. When it does happen the caller hears a beep on their side. Its a bit like the sound cut out you hear when a call comes in when you have call waiting. For me, it doesnt happen enough that it bothers me but you should be aware of it before buying these phones.I see they are being sold on Amazon for $39.99. This is a steal, in my opinion and worth buying."
3,Incompatible with Microsoft Wireless Keyboard/Mouse Combo,I have a Microsoft Wireless Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000 (mouse & keyboard). The KVM has separate USB ports for mouse and keyboard. I suspect that the intermittent problems I experienced were due to having a single wireless transceiver for keyboard and mouse.
3,Pretty Good... but...,"I've had one for over a year. It's been reliable.However, I cannot boot one computer while using another. If I do, then after the computer boots it will not know which resolutions my monitor supports and will set the resolution to some much lower resolution. Since the resolution information (called ""DCC"") is exchanged during boot up, the problem is that the switch doesn't store my monitor's DCC information so it could be provided at boot-up.Perhaps this is not a problem with all monitors and video cards, but it is with my 1680 by 1050 monitor and all the video cards in my four PCs."
3,Functional but falls short of expectations,"I've been using this KVM switch with 3 PC's and a laptop for about 4 months now. 2 PC's run windows xp, laptop run windows vista and the other pc runs ubuntu.I like the fact that I can share audio devices through this KVM and also that I can do a partial toggle, where I can just switch the keyborad+mouse+video to a different PC while listening to audio from another.But, my biggest problem is when I'm working on one PC and boot another at the same time. If the PC that is booting up is not 'in focus' then the KVM switch provides it with very low display resolutions (800x600). This is painful.All that their firmware needs to do is remember the the current resolution being used (or was last used) and provide it to the new PC that is booting up.I thought since the product has been around for at least 3 years, this would have been resolved by now. Unfortunately, iogear has absolutely no firmware upgrade for this product."
3,not very accurate,i tought this gun would be a steal for the price but of cource u get what u pay for so this gun has soo much curve its not just up hop i tried to ajust it it will go to the rite and left and can almost never hit the target.
3,Ramses's Opiniom,"Some of the best Chicano rappers were included in this album, but the songs were not as good as as they should've been. Knightowl is good, so he should include songs from his own inspiration in the next album."
4,Very Satisfying,"A rarity: a good fantasy novel that doesn't leave you waiting for the next book to find out what happens! A very well crafted story, with colorful characters. Buy it!"
2,The Queer Painter,A very good story plot ruined by the all-too-constant attempt to persuade the reader into sharing the author's view that homosexuality is normal.
4,I couldn't put it down!,This book suprised me by how good it was. The author does an extremely good job with character development. I read it from cover to cover almost in one sitting.
3,3.6 to 3.7,"I would give this book, in comparison to all of the other Fiona Patton books I've read thus far, an 8 on the scale of one to ten. However, compared to books in general, I would give this book about a six or a six point five. The reason being that the plot is so-so, and too cookie-cuttered to hold interest for long. The details were saturated with cliches, and the descriptions of things too thin. I don't know how to explain it, except to compare it to using veggie broth blocks instead of an actual chicken when preparing chicken noodle soup--it tastes different. Basically, too much of what's said in Paiter Knight has already been said a million times by other people decades before."
5,Nice product from Dockers,"These are great looking dress pants, with the maintenance requirement of a pair of jeans."
1,"Advertised as 100% cotton, but a cotton/poly blend","Amazon's product information for these Premium Dockers says they are 100% cotton. They aren't. The Premium Dockers that arrived have a red tag announcing that the pants are an ""innovation"" -- 80% cotton and 20% polyester. They look like cotton/poly, and in a quick try-on they feel like cotton/poly. If you want the comfort of all-cotton Premium Dockers, these may not be the pants for you. The one-star is a response to advertising these pants as ""100% cotton"" but sending me a cotton/poly blend."
4,Casca's African Adventure!,"This was one of Barry Sadler's best modernistic Casca adventure.Chock-full of action and adventure we all expect of an action/adventure series, along with hardcore men on a mission to assasinate an African madman bent on hostile takeover, Casca and his interesting mercenary friends, (solid characters from other novels like Gus and George and Van),fly into Africa and parachute into the stronghold of a tribal crazed madman, the huge Matthew Dzhombe.Anything that can go wrong does, and after a double crossing, Casca and his mercenary friends are on the run through the wilds of the Dark Continent. (Casca even acts and thinks like Tarzan! Another one of my all-time favorite book characters.) And what you have left is a race against time, with hardcore action through and through!This was better edited than the previous novel, Casca: The Legionnaire. And it was better written, showing the comfort levelthat Barry felt at writing this kind of stuff."
4,Good book,Suzanne Brockmann is one of my favorite romance authors. Her books are romantic with enough humor and intrigue to entertain. This one does not disappoint.
2,frustating,"The romance was okay, kind of superficial. What is really frustrating is the fact that the mystery of her brother is never solved. I was hanging on until the end to find out and was let down."
2,unlike brockmann books,boring and slow. Confused characters. Not well written. Seemed very unlike Suzanne Brockmann writing. NEarly put me off the writer !
4,The Power of the Blues,"I've loved RTx since i heard Cats and Dogs a year or so ago, and i can say that Veterans of Disorder is the closest they have come to making the flat out rock record that their major label albums hinted at. The noisy, pure distortion and feedback of earlier masterpieces like Twin infinitives is usurped almost completely (other than ""Sickazz Dog"") in favor of making an album that is equal parts pure rock (a la ""Teeth"") and bluesy rock (a la ""Stevie""). The first two tracks set the tone for this mix, with the great rockin' riff of ""Waterpark"" and the slow bluesy ""Stop"". Even though I could have lived without ""Sickazz Dog"", the aforementioned openers, the tropicalia-cum-psychedelia of ""Lunch Money"" and the flat out excellent ""Blue is the Frequency"" more than make up for that minor mis-step. A very strong 4. Too bad they couldn't have ended it on this high a note."
4,I love it!,"I have had this tv for a long time and nothing has gone wrong with it. The picture is great and the speakers are awesome. It is very light for the size, being a rear projection tv. No complaints here!"
2,i am so dissapointed!,i got this tv and really loved it at first. after a few months it started to mess up once in a while and when it was 5 months old the light engine went out. i called rca and they said there was no service center where i live. so i had to send it to a different town 40 miles away. its been 4 months now and still i dont have my tv fixed!! i have called the service center every week. finally i went and picked it up. now it is at my home waiting for an exchange of a new set. i wonder how long this will take?? i think its crazy i have had to wait so long for a replacement!!! dont buy it u will b sorry... tech support sux!!!
3,THE DETAIL WAS EXHAUSTING,"A fat book that was a labor to finish. It is designed and written for an undergraduate college course at an engineering school. MANY MANY MANY AND I MEAN MANY problems/questions at the end of each chapter. Problems/exercises are academic exercises to teach java, not real world programming problems. It is not perfect, but there does not appear to be anything better"
5,Fits great!,"It does exactly what promised - holds the belly in and doesn't give you dreaded ""panty lines"". I am used to thongs, so that didn't bother me at all. It's probably not for everyday wear, but comfortable enough for a party or an event under a formfitting dress."
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"I ordered this item on Tuesday morning and it was in my mailbox by Friday. That was great.I purchased the product mainly hoping it would eliminate the pooch on the upper part of my abdomen. I wear size small on top, so I naturally ordered a small size. I am quite disappointed. The product doesn't do half its job.It failed as a tummy control shapewear. There is absolutely no control in the upper part and the pooch is still there.I found this product to be more effective as a waist-cincher. That is the only thing that I like about this product. After putting it on, my shape looks a lot like Rihanna's, the popstar, from the front and the back."
1,save your money,"This item is not firm at all. If your trying to use this for stomach support, don't waste your time. The front of this shape wear is cut to high, if you have low stomach issues. Your stomach sticks out in the lower portion of the girdle."
2,Not a good fit...,"Read the reviews and checked the website for sizing...when the item first came, it seemed great. Firm and great support. But when you really start wearing it...you realize it doesn't fit very well. Clinches in too much so you get either muffin top on the top (stomach) or on the bottom (thighs). Really doesn't cover the entire torso area either. This item can actually emphasize your problem areas...so I'd skip it."
5,It's Buffy done right,"Golden knows his Buffy. And he knows that it's not HIS Buffy. He plays the What If game to great effect. He sets up his adventure much like the episode The Wish. Anyone can die. Some of them do. He wonderfully captures the personalities of all the scoobies (bonus points for his treatment of Oz). It's well worth the embarrassment I felt when I picked up a book from the young adult section( right next to Sweet Valley High and Charmed). Save yourself that trouble, buy online."
3,if you miss the series...,then this book takes you back into the Buffyverse. It is not the best out there but it was fun to dive back in and is worth the price.
3,Order size up,"The stockings are decent quality for the price. However, I like my stockings to come up high on my leg....these seem to be short and possibly a little small because it is hard to keep the seam centered on the back of my leg.I didn't originally order plus size since I am only a size 8, but I guess I will try that instead of regular."
3,No elastic but nice!,These have no elastic but they lood good. My wife had to keep pulling them up but overall nice! I would recommend the ones that have elastic on top so they can stay on.
1,stocking are meant to stay up,Not the best pair of thigh highs. Poorly made and they kept rolling down. I finally just threw them out. Waste of money.
2,these are very short--only for petite girls,"These arrived on time and are lovely but if you want to wear them with garters you should be 5'4"" or shorter!"
3,Fair Stockings,These were not as sheer as I had hoped but did not look bad on me. The back seam adds were very sexy and the lace tops looked good. I think I will look for other stockings in the future but at the price this was not a bad buy.
2,good customer service,"the stockings had a runner in one of them, but the company refunded my money. they had good customer service."
1,Poor nylon quality,"these have that walmart/drugstore messy, ""dusty"" nylon mesh vs the smooth, elegant, silky nylon mesh that you would expect for thigh highs.When you wear thigh highs you want to feel and look sexy in them...not feel like you're wearing your grandmom's stockings."
4,Runs a bit big,"I liked them but they were a bit long, and I'm 5'8! So I'd def order a smaller size next time and if youre short order a MUCH smaller size."
2,I now know that I hate back seams.,Like I said I now know that I hate back seams it was just such a pain getting them in place and making them stay there but the thigh high them selves where really nice.
4,Beautiful and silky,"I purchased these for my wedding. They stayed up beautifully. I am tall, with a 34"" inseam, and these fit great. They are very sheer, and therefore delicate, so great care needs to be taken when handling them, as they pull easily. But that sheer, sexy look is worth it."
3,Ripped rather easily,These stockings got a rip the first time I wore them. They were just purchased for photos but I wouldn't have been able to use them again.
1,not the best,"One of the stockings came with a hole in the back of it!! If i wanted a hole in them i would have intentionally bought them that way, this is a total bummer one looks good and the other doesn't."
5,"Nice looking, feels great and lasts long","I used it so many times before it started to tear... It need a garter belt, it does not stay by itself not even for one minute, but it's not actually a problem.When it had so much runners (which took a long time) to wear it outodoor, I kept wearing it indoors for some times, lol. I will certanly buy again."
2,Rough feeling,These are as I suspected and very rough feeling. Not silky feeling at all. But since these are for a honeymoon and will not make it through the evening I am not worried about it too much!
4,A little thin...,They are a bit thin so I feel like I have to treat them gingerly. Aside from that they're great!
3,sexy,"loved how sheer they were, but they didn't stay up like I thought they would. Need a garter belt, which I didn't have on the occasion of wear. Lovely, and husband gave them 5 stars. would have liked them more if they had felt more secure."
4,Great Irish story,"If you like Irish castles, folklore, and romance, this is the book for you!The characters are really fun. I liked Bridget and her southern 'ya'll' and comfort food. I could almost smell the meals that she cooked! Her son was gorgeous. Riley, be still my beating heart! He sounded divine!This really got at your heart strings and left you with a feel good attitude after reading this!Recommend!"
4,Easy quick read,This was a cute book. A little predictable but for the price you couldn't beat it. It does make me curious about what will happen next so I am glad there is a book 2.
4,Another great book in a series of great romances!,A vacation without leaving your house! Captivating characters- well written. I will buy them as long as she keeps writing them! Excellent series of romances with some pretty steamy moments.
5,Amazing!,Mulligan Stew was a fantastic story which traveled me in Scotland. I really enjoyed reading it.Very powerful and sizzling romance!
3,The Mulligans have it,"Any book set in Ireland entices me. Add the name, Mulligan, and I must have it. This story combines family, customs, and the magical adherence to superstition. It was a fun read, but could have dispensed with the graphic sexual scenes and have been a stronger book for it."
2,Not my cup of tea!,"Although Mulligan Stew seemed the type genre that I usually enjoy, I found Deb Stover's hillbilly slang (such as ""reckon"" and ""ya'll"") quite annoying throughout the book. Imaging Bridgette's voice in that whiney, Tennessee twang just ruined the read for me. Overall it was a pretty good story line though."
2,Disappointing,"I have a couple other Tweezerman items that I am happy with. Unfortunately, my first impression was that the clippers were awkward to hold. For starters, once unfolded for use there was nowhere to stow the fold-out nail file. So it just flopped around and got in the way...or rubbed against the end of the lever.But that was not the biggest problem with these clippers. Notice I'm using past tense. The biggest problem was the spring action stopped working on the very first use. So I had to turn right around and send them back.On the plus side, they come with a great warranty and free sharpening.I would only recommend these as a travel item. They fold compact but they are not the most comfortable clippers to hold."
1,Save your money,I have used Henckels folding clippers without problem. I purchased one of these for different kit. This model didn't have the power to clip through my thumb or finger nails. It was a waste of money.
4,Tiny but not perfect.,I really like these and don't have the a problem with the file. The only problem I have is that I feel like the cutting edge should be curved more. Because it is so straight I have to do many small clips to get the correct curve. Overall I really like these anyway for travel but I still use normal clippers at home.
1,Not enough leverage,"Have to press it all the way tight closed to create enough force for cutting. I would like more lever to it. Also, the file part just flops around while you try to cut your nails."
1,Worst Clipper Ever Made,"After a half a dozen uses the clipper stopped working and will only just pinch the nail. It looks like the two blades are not lined up any more, can't understand how this would happen we only use it to cut nails. I have owned another French style clipper that worked great for over 20 years till it got misplaced. Do not waste your money on this piece of crap."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this item largely because it said it was made in USA. People can talk about components of some things coming from abroad, but bottom line - it is not made in USA! It is imported from Asia. Totally disappointed and P.O.ed in being misled! It's going back to where it came from!"
3,Not the best.,"I had owned a clipper that closed similarly to this one for years. It finally broke. I search forever trying to replace it. I was fortunate to find this one made by Tweezerman, but it is a bit flimzy. I have a feeling I would be looking for a new one soon."
3,It's ok.,"It cuts nails, but you have to use more force than I expected; at least on my nails. I love the fact that they fold flat making them easy to carry in pants pockets. The file works very well. If they were sharper and a little more sturdy made (heavier metal) I would buy them again."
4,It's huge!,"It's far bigger than I expected it to be. Mine came with a spoon, and I still plan to use it for my loose tea. I can probably store a pound at a time in this thing."
3,Disk does not have all the pictures of the text,"I found it very disconcerting that the author gives details of how to use techniques with photos and doesn't include them all on the CD ROM that comes with the book. One learns by doing, but not if the examples are omitted from the tutorial disk. The disk probably contains about 1/3 of the pictures detailed in the book. That's inexcusable since it would have been ever so easy to add more pictures to a CD ROM that can hold hundreds if not thousands of examples."
5,Excellent as usual from Martin Evening,Another very easy to follow and comprehensive manual for CS. I've owned them all since Mr. Evening's 6.0 for Photographers and this one will prove to be as invaluable as the others. Highest marks!
2,Characters a bit too cartoonish,"I know Matilda is a kids' movie, but still is just gets ridiculously cartoonish. Matilda is a do-gooder genius. The parents are white trash who watch TV all day and curse. The worst is Headmistress Trunchbull, played by Pam Ferris. She is a sadist, physically abusing kids and making one eat chocolate cake until he nearly vomited. In fact, some of the scenes don't seem appropriate for a kids' movie at all. Also, the camera angles are sometimes odd (this is especially problematic because this version of the film isn't widescreen). Fortunately, Mara Wilson's charm and absolute cuteness save the film. She was definitely a good choice for the role."
5,Matilda,"This is an older movie, that I thought my 8 year old would enjoy. Well did she ever! Great purchase."
4,Excellent movie for children and adults!,"I have not read Matilda however I am a big fan of Dahl's books. This movie had my 4-year-old, my Mother, and myself in stitches. The story is a bit dark though and the villains in the movie are very mean! They are truly hilarious however."
4,An OK adaptation of a great book,"Our family loves the book, and most of our family liked this DVD pretty well too. I personally thought it was OK, but a bit lacking in the characterization of Matilda. In the book, Matilda is an introverted, sensitive kid who eventually develops the ability to move small objects, but it takes a lot of her energy to use it and she's usually exhausted afterwards. In the movie, Matilda is more of a typical ""cute Hollywood kid"" (not shy at all) who can move very large objects (and/or large numbers of objects) pretty much anytime without any difficulty or fatigue -- much like Samantha in ""Bewitched"". Oh well, that's Hollywood for you.Still, the movie is mostly enjoyable. I agree with a previous reviewer that it's probably too ""dark"" for kids under 7 -- the amount of meanness exhibited by some adults might upset them.The DVD extras are well-done, and my kids enjoyed the games."
4,VHS-Matilda,"Finally, after looking all over to replace my kids' copy of one of their all time favorites with no luck, I found it, and for a reasonable price. Very happy with my purchase, little slow on the shipping, but well worth the wait. My children were very excited."
2,"OK for teens and adults, NOT OK for young kids","The ugly parents are awful. OK, we've seen that before (think Harry Potter and the Dursleys).The ugly principal is beyond evil - and scary to witness.The pretty teacher is sweet and kind, but - well - ineffective and helpless. Poor kids.The teacher tells Matilda a tale of her childhood (TOO MUCH INFORMATION) wherein her mom dies and then her father commits suicide, leaving her an orphan in the care of the evil Aunty Trunchbull. This is where I clicked the movie off and told my 6yr old we're getting rid of this film. ""What did he do mama? He killed himself?"" Thank you SO much, Danny DeVito, for introducing suicide to the kindergarten set.Finally, Matilda tells her sweet-but-helpless teacher to ""adopt me, Miss Honey!"" And voila! just like that, papers are stapled together, parents quickly affix their signatures, and Matilda goes skipping off with her new mother. It takes more than that to adopt a DOG."
3,Whatever happened to truth in advertising??,"Who wrote the grossly deceptive product description for this DVD?? Matilda's dad?? Stupidly, I figured that ""special edition"" meant widescreen. Instead, I get the DVD only to find that its an annoying full-screen version. The movie itself gets 5 stars. This full-screen version gets two."
3,European widescreen,"To ""BOYCOTT THIS DISC!!!"" I'm stunned to see that this Special Edition is in fullscreen and I fell with Scott. If you want a widescreen edition of ""Matilda"" real bad, then you can get it on Region 2. Fortunately, for me, I live in Denmark and have it ... and it is worth to have in widescreen cuz the pictures are well composed!"
4,A great family movie...,"I watched Matilda on cable, and I found it very charming, funny, and enjoyed it alot. It's the story of a little girl, who was a ""mistake"" according to her self-involved mother, who is played quite brilliantly by Rhea Perlman. Matilda pretty much raises herself and teaches herself to read, by the age of 7, she is reading Moby Dick. Once enrolled in school, she goes through a barrage of adventures and not always such pleasant ones. It is a story that children can easily follow, and parents can rest easy. This is probably one of the best family/children's movies I have ever seen. I was very impressed by the performances of everyone in the cast. Mostly impressed by the woman who plays the principal of the school, she really turned in a very convincing portrayal. Matilda is definitely a great film for family viewing. There are a few frightening parts, but all in all, it is full of wholesome entertainment that we can all appreciate."
3,A Fine Film for Older Children,"My 4-year-old daughter received this as a Christmas present. Although it is entertaining, it's one I recommend you hold off on until your child is a bit older (6 - 9). The violence is not that bad (my daughter knew it was just a movie), but my objection was the insults that were used frequently, due to the unsavory characters. A younger child would pick up repeating the insults pretty quickly. However, Pam Ferris was a great villain, Embeth Davidtz was lovely as Miss Honey and Mara Wilson and her classmates were adorable."
4,Matilda - a short review,A cute movie and maybe a little too corny now a days.It's still an ok movie for little kids to watch though.
3,Well...it was almost a faithful adaption.,"I'm giving this film three stars for the acting and the cuteness in the film. However, hollywood had done it again decided to add super powers to little Matilda. Why couldn't they keep it the way it was in the book? When I was little, the book encouraged me to read because Matilda was such an avid reader. Adding the telekinsis element to the film detracts from the purpose of the film."
5,Great Movie,"I think ""Matilda"" is one of the sweetest movies ever. There is lots of different emotions throughout this flick that will have you , laughing, crying, scared, and heart-touched. A great family movie that every one should have in their collections."
5,Funny!,"My kids and I love this little film! (My 'kids' are 19 and 28) We watch it every time it comes on and I intend to buy it. I love DeVito and M.S. Trenchbowl (sp?) Cute and very funny, I always laugh."
3,the saying even works w/ kids movies the book was better,Danny Devito gave exellent effort in this movie. He acted and played a major roll in the making of it. He tried and compared to other kid movies it isn't that bad but the amazing talents of Dahl (the author of the book) can't be shown in this movie. I really didn't want to say this but the book was better. If u love the book it might be worth seeing it for a few scenes
2,Child's play,"Sometimes you need art explained to you, and maybe that's why I had a mixed reaction to the film MATILDA. It did not bore me, that's for sure. I thought child actor Mara Wilson did a great job in the title role. Were the filmmakers telling the story through the point of view and imagination of a little kid? That would explain why this adult had trouble understanding MATILDA. Growing up helps you forget some of the confusion and pain - as well as free spirit - we all probably had in childhood. My favorite scene: Matilda's dance to ""Little Bitty Pretty One,"" because through all that turmoil, she's making her life what she wants it to be."
4,Love,"I have always liked this movie, and the DVD is in great condition. I could not be happier with my purchase!"
1,Scratchy,"About half way through the movie, the movie stops and stalls..you can not watch it any further. I am very disappointed in it.I would not order any movies from this site.Sue Y."
1,Kid's Review,"Warning This Is a WHITCH Movie which means this is A Bad movie, I Just Really Didn't Like this movie because Of the whitchcraft. And then it turned out That this is an EVIL movie. and I Got 6 words For this Pile of junk. 1 the Child called Matilda was a Gentle girl but, there was a Problem with this movie, that witches are helping Matilda . 2 the Invincible Whitches Attacking the teacher, oh and 3 the teacher.Shes a Really monstrous human The teacher is throwing them out thru the Window Holding them by the hair , and calling them well she says kind of a Ugly words. 4 Matildas Parents are like if her parents had a bad Family, 5 Matilda teaching her parents a lesson and That is not Very Good, 6 The whole thing is Boring, I Don't know why People Keep Putting Great Reviews About this movie but. if you ask Me The Movie Called Hercules was bad enough But This Is the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen so make sure that you will see all the reviews Before buying A movie."
1,Violent horrible movie to give your kids nightmares,"I had to abort watching this movie; my kids are in tears and even the adults feel a bit sick. First you must suffer through an extended sequence of watching an obnoxious abusive family mistreat the heroine. Then ""enjoy"" her take nasty revenge. [warning plot spoiler follows] We turned it off when we got to the ""school"" in which a sadistic principal is shown to throw a second grade child out an upperstory window and put another in an iron maiden torture device. This movie is obscene. No possible ending can redeem the first half hour."
3,LOVE the movie; the DVD isn't widescreen!!!,"WHY, oh, WHY wasn't this made into a widescreen special edition? Some of the special features are even in widescreen. What in the world is up with that?? I enjoyed the special features, but wish there had been more (like a commentary). I don't get why they wasted time in making this without using the widescreen format. I feel like I've been taken.About the movie: this is a favorite in our family. It's a bit dark, and some people are upset by it, but there's a positive message and a happy ending (oops, was that a spoiler?) I highly recommend it, and probably the best age to see this would be 6 or 7 and up, depending on how sensitive your child is."
1,BOYCOTT THIS DISC!!!,"This is a wonderful film, but I saw it in the theatre and am outraged that it is being realeased yet again in the pan and SCAM format. This film is so wide that you lose more than half the picture!!! This is a joke of a special edition. Audiences are fed up with getting cropped images on their DVDs. Every time you buy a so called ""fullscreen"" (euphemism for cropped) disc, the terrorists win."
1,Why Didn't We Get A Widescreen DVD?,I saw the movie Matilda and I liked it and thought it was a cute movie and I have to wonder why this older region 1 DVD and also the new so called special edition region 1 DVD are pan and scan only and don't have widescreen formats! A widescreen DVD was released over in Europe so why not here too? 5 star movie but a 1 star DVD!
1,Did not get my item!!!!!,Did not know where else to turn. I have not recieved this item. I waited a few extra days and still nothing!!!!!
3,Good Movie!,"This is one of my absolute favourite movies. But I agree with the other reviewers, I WANT a widescreen version. ""Full Screen"" is so outdated. In fact, I don't think I know anyone with a TV that is not 16:9. All of my friends and family upgraded years ago."
5,Gonna Hop Now,"In the tradition of ROCKY and REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT comes MATILDA (1978), the inspiring story of a pugilistic marsupial from Down Under who's granted one last shot at redemption by stepping into the ring and going a few rounds with the World Heavyweight Boxing Champion ( Larry Pennell ). Old pros Gould and Mitchum add class and a gritty urgency to this rousing, one-of-a-kind experience, so much so that MATILDA remains one of the greatest, most enduring boxing films ever made; think of it as RAGING BULL with a kangaroo."
3,Awesome !,"Matilda is a really fun movie. I'm 23, and still like to watch it. Too bad that it's only full screen. If you have the capabilities, get the region 2 dvd from Europe. It's widescreen (why they didn't do it for the US version, I don't know) so you'll be able to see the whole picture."
4,"Good defeats evil. Interesting, fun film.","Matilda is a genius; however, she grows up in conditions that are certainly less than ideal. Her parents consider her to be an annoyance and mostly ignore her. She finally gets to go to school (her parents enroll her late, though she taught herself to read at an early age) and has to deal with the sinister headmistress at the school. Fortunately, the teacher for her class is very kind and caring. Matilda develops telekinetic powers and uses these to fight off the bullies around her, for her good, and that of her friends. The film has a satisfying ending that will leave you smiling."
2,Not as good as original,"Simply said, it was one of those purchases where you HOPE that the remixes are somehow just a little bit better, if not longer, than the original song. These remixes still leave you hoping."
2,could have been,"This cracker is similar to rye crackers in texture. has a soy-ish taste. tough to crush into soup, very dense. Needs baked taste, and needs to loose soy taste. The cracker that came close and could have been, but falls short. The ""best"" gluten free cracker yet, which means gluten free crackers suck!"
2,Ehhh.,"I got a nice workout, but it was all too boring for me. If you're someone who needs the constant interest and new things to keep going, this just won't be it."
1,Disappointed,I am a Pilates Teacher and I found the exercises were more for Yoga and whatever else you call it. Did not find any of the moves interesting. Trudie's sidekick did all the work and I didn't care too much for his voice. I thought for a video that Trudie's form would be better.
5,Loved it!!!,"There are very few advanced pilates DVDs on the market. Core Strenth is a fresh breathe of air. It is a great combination of traditional pilates exercises with other types of movements including yoga. It's not for the beginner, but provides a great challenge for those of us who are bored doing the same moves."
4,I feel the burn,I love this DVD but must admit that I have not finished the work out. I got half way through it. It's for intermediate to advanced practitioners. There were several advanced modifications I have not seen on other DVDs. I wish there was a little more instruction on the form and breathing for the beginner. I found it very relaxing and not boring at all. I will definitely continue to workout to this DVD. My limbs feel fully stretched.
1,To much,Its a nice picture disc but you want to much for it. If you come down on the price you can sell . I'm biding on the some one at this store were I live for 65 bucks I still have five days to go . So good luck
1,Avoid this like the plague,"I type this from the LAN connection of the WBR-2310 because the wireless connection has coughed up and quit. Again. This router requires constant attention. I have upgraded the firmware twice and still there are bugs. One bug has even been introduced by the latest firmware. MAC filtering no longer works after the latest update. The router requires physical rebooting at least once per session. It assigns IP addresses that are not in the allowable IP string, thus disallowing the connection. When it drops my connection, it must be physically restarted before allowing me to connect again. It's a horrible waste of time and money. I will never, ever own another D-Link product. I have owned and operated Linksys, Netgear and D-Link routers. D-Link is the worst by far. Buyer, beware."
3,Hard to tell the rating,"Its hard to tell if this router will work right. I installed it in place of my old 11b Seimans and Linksys WAP combo. I was up on the net immediately wired and wireless. My problem though is I cannot access the router to configure security. I chose to do a straight install without the Dlink ""Network Magic"" software because I have done this before with little or no trouble and I do not like ""trial programs"". Dlink support is very responsive and I believe I will soon have a resolution to the problem. I think the problem is my current IP configuration and am soon to talk to a Dlink live support tech."
2,No better than the cheapest options,"This thing is fifteen feet away from my PC, with very little interference, and I usually have a ""very low"" connection or none at all. This is less powerful than the cheapie I used to rent from my cable Internet provider, but at least it's compatible with my Wii."
3,Lot of disconnects,"I bought this router for cheap somewhere else. Wasn't expecting much but just wanted no disconnects. I have to say this, this is a bad product. Don't know why D-Link had to ruin its name by bringing this out. It worked just fine for a couple of days and then it started to disconnect every half hour. I exchanged it for another piece (same model) and the new had the same issues. I updated the firmware to the latest version and disabled the gaming mode (to check if it works) its working fine till now.On the up side it has a good web interface and lots of features. The setup was easy and did not take long."
2,Good performance...for a while,"I've used this router for about a year and have had decent performance. Unfortunately, during those times when I did have issues the non-existent tech support was adding insult to injury. Now the router stopped working, but doesn't give any error messages or indications anything is wrong save the fact that it doesn't. I've had mixed results with D-Link in the past, but this most recent interaction has confirmed my belief that D-Link produces products (at least wireless routers) that are a good choice only when it's the only one available."
3,Software spam,"The software supplied carried a network managing package optional however I spent two hours to hook up my network to find it only worked after I installed the option. Naughty, Naughty."
1,Horrible!,Horrible product! Just spent 3 hours trying to install and configure this product. Several calls to tech support was a waste of time.It's not even sturdy enough to use as a door stop!!
4,"great flexibility, slightly difficult if you do not know what your doing","I was impressed with the options the router offered on its web interface. It does DMZ, MAC filtering, offers a way to set up a web server and even offers a simulation of the web interface on its customer support site so you can see exactly what it looks like. I would recommend this to someone, however it may be a bit tricky to someone who is not familiar with routers at all to set up security and all that. It seems to have a pretty good range, reached my garage."
2,My PS3 is not a fan!,"I bought this a while ago at a local retailer, and i'm now kicking myself in the butt for not researching on amazon first! I have to give this router 2 stars because it works fine for my laptops. The problem is that, my ps3 loses it's signal, and the worst part is that I can't play COD4 online AT ALL(My Fav Game By the way!!!) My last router had no issues."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"Keeps dropping connections. And not just the wireless connections, it even drops wired connections. I would give it zero stars if possible."
1,The only bad review I've ever put on Amazon,"Once you can GET this router to work with your computer, it is fine. My husband just got a toshiba notebook and it doesn't even seem to be COMPATIBLE with the router. We have wasted over 12 hours with tech support (who are REALLY good, but who wants to waste so much time on something that shouldn't be SO complicated).My husband and I thought we were computer geeks until we got the router and had to rely on tech support for installation."
3,Compatibly trouble,"We have several older Dells. The built in NICS have trouble with this router. Not impressed with the range. We have a 60' job trailer, we get 3 of 5 bars on opposite ends of the trailer. Netgear gets 5."
1,This thing blows!!,"I guess this is what I get for buying a cheap wireless router. The box said it was a 10 minute set-up but 2 days later I could not get the thing to work. I kept getting stuck at the ISP username/password screen. Perhaps it just wasn't capatible with my system or my cable modem. I tried calling customer service but I get annoyed when I'm on hold for too long. I'm sure this is a great product if you know how to get it to work, but this thing was advertised as a kind of plug n' play type device and I'm just not that technically savvy nor do I have the time to trouble shoot this thing."
1,DLink is the new Hawkings,"I have over 30 years in the computer industry and run a computer repair business. Routers are the one item I try to keep in stock to help prevent viruses on customer computers. I purchased 10 WBR-2310's earlier in the year and another 10 WBR-1310s back in August.Of the 2310's, about 5 had issues and were returned to me for configuration. I had to contact D-Link for instructions on how to reset the device so that it would accept a new configuration (This is not the normal reset button on the back). Of the 5 that were returned, one was defective and had to be returned.The 1310's also have issues. When you attempt to connect to the login screen to setup the configuration, the router resets the Ethernet port. Again, this makes configuring the router impossible.The failure / problem rate on D-Link has escalated and I for one hope D-Link works out the problem with their quality control.Until that time I would look at the Linksys or another brand of router."
1,"Suitable for a mediocre access point or doorstop, little else","I am wishing I could give this product ""negative"" stars.I bought 4 of these for an installation I was doing that requires port forwarding. Have read all other reviews with great interest and have used PPoE on the router. These things stop forwarding ports, need to be rebooted frequently, and are hard as heck to work with. Save yourself. Buy something else it will suck your time and eventually you will give up anyway.Also as mentioned earlier - D-Link's support is a hideous joke."
4,A good router that have little flaws.,"I got this router mainly because of its price. I upgraded from a DI-524 D-Link router. I didn't even use the CD that came with it. I just plugged the ethernet cables and power cable in, go to 192.168.0.1 and it worked. I checked for updates for this router from time to time. Sadly, sometimes there are glitches and the wireless would not show up on other devices, but a simple reboot usually does the trick. Overall, this router is great for its performance and price."
5,exceptional product,"this product works great and the price is right - great coverage, easy setup, no problems whatsoeverI've had wireless routers from several manufacturers and for all its worth, both of my D-Links have been the most reliable and easy to use"
5,Great wilress router that is also very resonable in price,This is a great wireless router. Very quick and easy to install... cheap in price. That is how it should be..
2,Great for 1 year. Then failed miserably,"The WBR-2310 was great for a year, then it started rebooting a couple of times a day. Now, it won't keep a constant connection for more than 40 seconds. What an incredible disappointment to have to buy another router so soon. I have checked the networking forums and the D-Link support site and nothing is working. I cannot maintain a connection long enough to even try changing the settings."
1,"Last D-Link product, a former D-Link fan","I've always had D-Link routers, and until this one, had always been very happy with them. Previous D-Link products I owned were easy to set up, this one is not. Previous products were reliable, this one is VERY MUCH not reliable. Like so many others, I have constant problems with wireless clients dropping connection. It would seem that D-Link may have gone from being a manufacturer of good products for low prices to one who makes inferior products. Alas, no more D-Link products for me after this fiasco."
1,Constantly Disconnects.,"I've had this router for about 6 months, it worked fine for about the first two and then it started disconnecting for no known reason. I upgraded the firmware and it was smooth sailing for about a month and a half but now it is back to it's old tricks.I've done just about everything I can think of to make this thing functional, searched the web and D-Links site for solutions... but to no avail.I like the features and the look of the router it's self but I guess it is time to toss this one and move on."
1,Do not buy this P.O.S. !,"This router works fine, if you don't mind power cycling the thing at least once a day. The dopey tech support people will take you on a wild goose chase having you set up the router to the exact same settings that you had before calling tech support, or change some random setting just to get you off the phone. Since power cycling the router fixes the problem, and any change that is made during your tech support call resets the router as well, they assume the problem is fixed since you get a connection again anyway. When all else fails, the tech support people will try to blame your computer as the source of the problem even if it works fine everywhere else. Don't buy this headache."
1,Horrible Tech Support,"I've discovered the D-Link tech support department is clueless about residential gateway terminology. Therefore you must be a network and telecom guru, or you will encounter major difficulties getting this thing to work, ESPECIALLY WITH INDIA INTERNET (aka Earthlink)!!!!!"
3,Excellent router once latest firmware is installed,"Router was functional, but very buggy until the most firmware upgrade. Since updating to version 1.04 firmware, this router has been amazing. Completely stable, and with the addition of a high-gain external antenna it easily provides coverage to my whole house. The router is on the second floor and I get good reception even in the basement."
1,Never ending problems,"I've had this router for over a year now and it's always had problems. From dropping the wireless connection (and needing a restart) to poor configuration interface that requires restarting for minor config changes, this proved to be an unfit solution. I will think twice before buying a d-link router next time. :("
3,Got the Answer Here,"After a few calls, I spoke with a nice woman. The answer to the issues is to upgrade to firmware version 1.4 NOT 1.5, which has issues. You can search around and find the firmware, which is a .bin file. You go into your Dlink 192 page to update the firmware there, browsing for the 1.4 upgrade. Ive been fine since.If this is confusing, then you havent spent hours trying to figure it out like i did. if you can follow these vague instructions, you deserve it! keep trying!"
2,Worst router I've ever owned,"This is my third router, and is one of the worst ones I've had yet. I bought this less than 4 months ago, and already its locking up on a daily basis. Now I see they put out a new firmware update, so I went to put version 1.03 on my router. The stupid thing won't work at all now, please save yourself the money and do not purchase this. I gave it a 2 because when it does work, it does a good job. How hard is it to run a wireless laptop, a desktop, and an Xbox 360 without locking, apparently for DLink its impossible."
2,"eh, not that great to begin with and dies a slow death","Had one of this at the grandparents house, supporting a Tivo and a Mac Mini behind a cable modem. Pretty much the lowest possible use a device like this is ever going to see. It was a bit of a hassle to set up initially, mainly because the web interface tries to be too helpful. It seemed to lose the internet connection once a quarter, for the first year. Then it started acting up monthly. Now it's unable to stay connected for more than an hour."
1,Worst router I ever bought,"Let me tell you that I have had DLink products in the past and for the most part they worked just fine. This one, however, is the worst piece of hardware I have ever had the displeasure of owning. Connections drop every couple minutes or so over the wireless, and the router itself somehow resets every couple of hours, so a wired connection is a ticking bomb as well. I bought this since it was a good bit cheaper than other routers out there, but now I clearly understand the price differential. Do yourself a favor and spend a few dollars more, but actually get something that works."
1,Router Did not work,"Purchased this router, went to set it up and the ip address was not recognized. I could access the internet through the router, but the router was not recognized. Called Dlink to trouble shoot and after 1.5 hours could not get it up and running. They wanted to continue to trouble shoot the issues. I had spent way too much time attempting to get working (never had issues like this). Purchased a netgear from Best buy, it was up and running in less than five minutes. Now I have the task of attempting to get this returned..."
1,Worst router I've had.,"I've had this router for many years as a backup router for when I need wifi at work. My connection would constantly get dropped, which is insanely annoying as I have to walk to the room where the router is in and reset it. I cannot view webpages or videos (like on youtube) or else it would drop my connection. I saw this product while browsing around at a computer store and bought it since I needed a router at work. I highly regret it as I should have read the reviews first. Do NOT get this router... Unless you want to disrupt your child's World of Warcraft addiction."
1,"Less than one star, if it was possible.","Where can I start. Since day one since it came out of the box it was horrible. It dropped its signal every 5 minutes, which is very frustrating. I've tried everything to fix it (changing channels, restoring factory defaults, etc.), nothing helped. So, I called customer service, which was even more painful! They told me to restore to default, which obviously didn't help before. This router shouldn't even be priced as high as it is. I would pay 5 bucks for it and no more. I've now switched to a NETGEAR and works A LOT better than that piece of c***.Screw ya D-Link"
2,Don't recommend this router,"I don't recommend this router. It does have good features such as stateful packet inspection (SPI) in the firewall; however, the router's reliability is poor. It's signal strength fluctuates greatly throughout the day and it drops signals. I recommend paying a little more and getting a better router."
1,PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!,"This has to be by far one of the WORST products I have purchase in quite sometime. The installation was pretty straightforward I was up and running in few minutes and then I began using the router... My wireless and wired computer would drop several times through out the day which was extremely annoying especially due to the fact I was working from home. I would call the help support go through the same hacking of configurations with them time and time again but to no avail. I finally lost it when yesterday evening I spoke with another ""help support"" technician going through the same help script that every other DLink technician took me through. She refused to allow me to speak with a senior tech, instead she simply suggested I exchange it for another one. You gotta be kidding me? I took that poor excuse of a router back to the store and gladly received my money back.Please do yourself a favour and do not waste your time or money on this product."
1,junk,"How long do you want to talk to someone in India? I have a Mac and the installing downloads do not work for Mac. Fine, talk to India once and get going. This piece of junk kept resetting or something requiring repeated calls to India way too many times in 3 months. Yesterday, after 2 hours on the phone I threw the thing across the room."
2,Don't buy it!,This router was fairly easy to set up and worked well for about 6 months before it started dropping connections. For all practical purposes after only 2 years it has become a useless piece of junk. It won't keep a connection more than 5 minutes when you can actually get a connection at all. At first unplugging it for a few seconds would get it going again but that rarely works anymore. I replaced it with a Linksys. I will never buy another D-Link product.
1,Disappointing Debut,"I had liked Souza's recent bossa nova album, Brazilian Duos, a good collection of guitar/vocal duets. Then I attended one of her concerts with John Patitucci. She seemed nervous and insecure on the stage, but she was happy when I asked her to sign my CDs in the backstage. Next day I decided to purchase all other Luciana Souza albums, starting by ordering An Answer To Your Silence, since i had been her debut album. Oh, I felt very very disappointed with this pseudo-fusion journey. Souza's own compositions are really mediocre, and she murders Gershwin's Embraceable You, a classic from the GAS (Great American Songbook). Her motionless treatments for two Brazilian standards by Antonio Carlos Jobim, Bonita and Retrato em Blanco E Preto, are gelid. Another Brazilian singer, Ithamara Koorax, recorded those two songs in much better performances, gifted with great emotion and sophistication. Souza should listen to her Rio fellow..."
1,Lack of energy,"What is this? No swing, no energy, no powerful solos. And they market this terrible album as a fusion set??? People interested in real fusion shall listen to Return to Forever, Mahavisnhu, Weather Report and even some alnbums by Santana like Borboletta and Welcome, with gorgeous vocal performances by such great singers as Leon Thomas and Flora Purim."
2,Color change,"I ordered this because it was my favorite lipstick. I was overjoyed to find an on-line source, since I can't get the Mod Pink Pearl color locally.It seems the formula must have changed. It isn't the same color as I have used before. There's less ""pearl"" and it seems lighter.I'm not a happy camper about the color change, but the service was just fine."
5,THE ABSOLUTE LICK,"This is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read.Fuzz takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride through the graffiti underworld and the Bronx otherworld of the early 1970s. The story is told with panache, style, sympathy and humour.Fuzz One, the heavy drinking and graffiti obsessed 11 year old, is a true hero.And the pictures are booming."
4,Back in the day..........,"... this was how it was. I could smell the layups as I read through these pages of graff history. Sure, it may be hard to believe he remembers what he ate back 30 years ago, but that type of embelishment gives this work it's flavor. If you were there, this will bring back memories. If you weren't, you'll get an idea of what you missed."
1,Pass this one by,I used to live on 233 rd street in the Bronx back in the early 70's. Along with my friends in the neighborhood i was into the graffiti movement.I was excited to get the book & read it.The stories are absurd for a boy 11 years old and the humor seems punched up by a struggling comedian.The photos are amaturish and blurry.Faith Of Graffiti and Subway Art are better choices to reminence about this great era!
5,to the point,"This story shows the uniqe talent of Anderson. he has learned to truly capture the Star Wars Universe. this like his many other books show he is a true ""Champion of the Force!"""
5,Can't wait till episode 1!,"During the painful time of waiting for episode 1,champions of the force helped through those tough times.I thought this book was very well written.I was glad to see them bring back another death star.Some people say that another death star is stupid.Well screw them!"
5,A wonderful ending to a marvoulus trilogy!,Anyone who didn't like this book ought to read it again! The book ended thi trilogy perfectly.
1,Does nothing to salvage the previous two books...,"I'll get right to it: the problem here, is that Anderson writes novels with plots worthy of comic books. Depth, complexity, introspection, dimension are all foreign to him. This would be OK, if, at least, the action scenes were interesting. Unfortunately they're not. It's not exactly a spoiler here, but the good guys win. Every engagement. Every battle. Sure, we want the Republic to win in the end, but someone ought to tell KJA that there's nothing terribly gripping about reading the Empire lose time and time again. In Zahn's trilogy he created a palpable threat. A strong bad guy. KJA does not, consequently his books lack any tension.And why does it seem to take less time to become a Jedi Knight than it does to get a mail-order Associates Degree?"
2,Finishes the trilogy like he started it -- poorly.,"A complete waste of time. See my reviews of the first two volumes of this trilogy to read my rantings and ravings. Tell me why everything must come as a ""trilogy"" now. Lucas spoke of creating the movies in the form of a ""trilogy,"" but did so following the form of a classic three-act drama. Mr. Anderson merely churns out three books, using the same lines and the same situations in each. (How many times must we read someone saying ""I've got a bad feeling about this,"" or someone quoting Yoda???)"
4,Fills in the gaps,"I actually read I Jedi (Stackpole) a long time ago and recently reread it on my iPad. Anyway if you read that book this trilogy will fill in the gaps about pretty much everything from Exar Kun to Kyp, and it does it prety well. My only BMC about it is that at times it felt like it was written for a 10 year old. The parts where Han and Lando are constantly playing sabbaac and winning the Falcon back from each other over and over again are sooooo predictable and Hans irrational anger that started it all was just lame and frankly could have been left out. All in all it was a pretty good set of books so they are worth the read for the background and side stories."
5,part 3 in one amazing trilogy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this book trilogy seriously is amazing from the very begining to the very end star wars books = the best of the best star wars is and always will be the best of the best
4,This is a good trilogy.,"I found the books to be good y self. They fit in well with the other Star Wars books. and if you did not read I, Jedi yet I would say pis that book up as well because it also has to do with this trilogy of books but, it also has it own plot but there are a lot of tie ins.This book by it's self is a good book but you would be lost without reading the other two."
2,KJA SUX!!!!!!!,"KJA has got to be one of the dumbest choices of authors to be chosen to write on Star Wars.For starters, the guy seems to like alluding to other events and characters created by other authors a LOT.Even worse,the characters don't maintain their personality at all. (e.g. Lando flirting with Mara?????????????)In addition,there are just too many continuity glitches.Howzit Exar Kun could blast Gantoris AND spirit-seperate Luke in the second book and then later be beaten so easily by the Jedi students?Kyp's reform also seemed cliched and stale to me.Also,why are the Imperial bereaucrats so dumb?If they were so ineffective, why were they in charge of the Maw Installation in the first place? Anyway, Lucasarts should fire KJA and all the idiotic Star Wars writers and get Timothy Zahn to write ."
3,an ok book,"This book was good, a good end to the jedi academy trilogy, Exar Kun is written very well. Kyp is the best part of the novel."
4,"Great Ending to the Trilogy, and a fine addition to the saga","I thought this was a great star wars book, was'nt as good as the Empire trilogy or the xwing series but it was a different type of book it was more about the force and that sort of thing. I did think it a bit unrealistic the way, luke is able to (kind of, or attempt to) train a load of Jedi. I always thought there was always two, a master and an apprentice. :) Anyway... If you like starwars, and dont mind another Death star, then I reccomend this one!"
1,A Horrible Book,"Why is it bad...well let's see:Horrible plot, no thought put into it, Ohh...what a surprise, another super weopon! No one in their right mind would waste 5 dollars on this crap."
5,Most action packed book I've ever read!,"This one was the best! From the very beginning till the very end of it, we are taken from one intense point to the other: Luke Skywalker struggles to win in a battle of life and death in which he is inexperienced, Han Solo faces a Death Star prototype, and a battle amongst a Black Hole cluster! Simply the best yet in the trilogy."
1,anderson is lousy,"Anderson's plots are barely adequate for b-class shoot-'em-up action movie much less worthy of the star wars name. He relies too much on ""superweapons"" and doesn't write enough. His best idea was a female Admiral, Daala, but the thought of Grand Moff Tarkin shagging anyone is repulsive, he doesn't seem the type to let his hair down, ever. My only hope is that his soon-to-come ""Chronology"" is good. he should go back to writing with L. Ron Hubbard and all those wackos"
1,This book was extremely disappointing.,"The first two books in the series weren't bad (not good but c'est la vie) but this one was rather awful. There are a few worthwhile characters and ideas in the series. Unfortunately, there are more inconsistencies(both within the series and pertaining to the star wars universe)and disappointment. The villains are more than disappointing , the plot is simplistic and unengaging and old characters are either out of character(Mara and Lando????)or have developed chronic cases of stupidity. This series also began the annoying Luke the hermit trend. Perhaps if I were younger and new to star wars and sci fi I could've enjoyed this book, but I doubt it."
1,Best of the Acedemy Trilogy but that isn't saying much,"I wanted to give this book 1.5 stars but since you can't I settled for 1. Champions of the Force is interesting to a point. There are some space battles that seem to be ok, but the major problems haunting all of Anderson's Star Wars books persist. Another superweapon enters the picture: Death Star prototype, run by beings who are so inept its supposed to be funny but comes off just annoying. Kyp Durron returns to the light side, and Exar Khun is defeated but by the end of the story, Durron is treated like buddy not a mass murderer. It's simply not realistic. Admiral Daala comes back to provide Imperial presence but it's not really needed. Anderson tries but the book is to predictable and simply not all that good. Useless characters and plot lines abound. Really enough is enough. If you wish to read about the opening of the Jedi Academy pick up I, Jedi not this trilogy."
3,"okay, quite a few holes","An okay book with a few bright spots and even more gaps in the plot.While I found Luke being seperated from his body intriguing, what Exar Kun did with this situation was, to say the least, stupid. He tries to destroy the body by the most ridiculous measures, instead of just incinerating it like Gantoris's. The whole situation was resolved way too early, and the focus was moved to more boring plot lines. Kyp was punished in no way for the death to billions he caused because he was 'possessed' by Exar Kun. The last I checked, you chose to go to the dark side and all actions made by you were your own choice, not because someone took control of you. Another Death Star, another lame plot line. Anderson's style is childish, and quite predictible. He leaves absloultely nothing for you to figure out yourself.A good library loan for even serious SW fans."
4,Excellent finish to the Jedi Academy trilogy,What a well written finish to the Jedi academy trilogy and also the end of the great Sith Lord Exar Kun. Kun was an excellently created bad guy and Kevin Anderson has performed well in this trilogy I fully urge you to also read Darksaber.
2,This is a review for the entire Jedi Academy Trilogy,"Anderson, like most Star Wars authors, has the tendency to portray Luke as a wimp. So far, the only author who ever had Luke as a a true Jedi was Tom Veitch in Dark Empire.Also, it's understandable to have a few unplausible events but with Anderson there's no limits. A Sun Crusher? It can fly through star destroyers? I could've understood a weapon that causes stars to super nova, but an invincible ship as well?A third thing is, how can a bunch of jedi APPRENTICES defeat a Sith lord. Do you not recall from The Empire Strikes Back, that Luke, as an APPRENTICE lost severly to Darth Vader? These Jedi that defeated Kun were weaker than Luke!So all-in-all I found this too far-fetch and would stick to Timothy Zahn's trilogy."
3,pretty good,"I think this was a good ending to the trilogy, but there were some parts that just seemed to not fit in with the original star wars like those energy spiders on kessell... anyway, i liked it all right"
4,Finally a Star Wars book that is exciting,"The final book in the Jedi Academy is outstanding. The book follows the Lucas style of multiple plots to its fullest extend. It is obvious that Anderson spends a great deal of time in the details of its plot. The reader seems drawn into the climax finally scene where you see a titantic battle between a proto-tye deathstar, the suncrasher and the rebel fleet on the brink of a swirling black hole. Marvelous, I especially liked how Anderson follow Bantam other plotlines and the plotlines of the Dark horse comics. He blends flawlessly into the Star Wars mythology"
5,Great book!,All Star Wars fans will LOVE this book. It's an excelent ending to this series. This book keeps your heart in your throat throughout the entire story
5,"A WONDERFUL, AND MASTERFUL CONCLUSION TO THE TRILOGY!","This novel soars. The writing style of Anderson is captivating. I could'nt put this book down. In the second book, luke skywalker becomes suspended beetween life and death. He is in this state at the Jedi Academy. Exar Kun tries to destroy his body. But lukes spirit reaches out to his nephew and neice, and they protect him. Meanwhile, Leia Finds out that the imperials are trying to capture her baby anakin on the planet anoth. She goes to try and save him. Kyp is piolting the sun crusher on a mission of mass destruction, he is trying to cause as much damage as possible to the empire. Han tries to talk Kyp out of it. There is much more to this wonderful conclusion, it is as good as DARK APPRENTICE the second in the trilogy. You will love this book, I guarante it!"
1,Anderson does NOT rule.,"How did I make it through this entire trilogy? Kevin Anderson has to be the worst writer in the Star Wars pantheon. He has a wooden style, with none of the spare elegance of Zahn or Hambly. His plots are wholly implausible. (""Let's see, what should I write about? I know: another super weapon! There's an original idea. Oh yeah, I should throw in an all-powerful super-villan who defeats Skywalker but then gets beat by a bunch of untrained rookies. Yeah that rocks."" NOT.) He has this annoying habit of giving you constant synposes of what happened 25 pages ago. The book is full of inconsistencies. All in all, my least favorite Star Wars novel to date."
2,Read it if you must,"Good story, terrible writing.Anderson's prose is trite, unimaginative, and, far too often, simply laughable. Which is a shame because the story is compelling.This is a key part of the Star Wars extended universe, however. So, read it if you must. But you've been warned."
3,I love the serise as a whole but...,"The serise started with a bang and it ended with..this not a bang, not even a wimper. What the final book does is take all the lose ends from the other books in the serise and tie them off in really stupid ways.For exampleAn evil sith lord killed by the happy good jediAn almost evil Kyp realizing his mistake halfway through the book and comsequently being FORGIVEN for all the horrable ...[stuff] he inflicted on people.We also see Moth Duel the evil smuggler of the first book reduced to a sniving whiner held up in a palace complex. The only thing that saves this book are the battles in space written in typical ...epic style."
4,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed this book.The only draw-back was that Exhar Kun was defeated to early in the book (and too easily).Otherwise that, I really enjoyed this book."
3,Bre's,"This book is quite an enjoyable read, but it does have some problems. Firstly, this superweapon fascination is just about wearing out. Secondly, Anderson is only a mediocre writer. Thirdly, Anderson always represents Luke as an omnipotent, all-powerful Jedi. A little of the humble humaness that Luke displays in the movies is needed here. Lastly, the Kyp Durron situation could have been resolved in - dare I say it? - a more realistic fashion. However, the characterisations - with the exception of Luke, Han and Mara - are good, and the plot moves along at a good pace. For die-hard Star Wars fans only."
3,Champions of the Force,"A definite read for Star Wars fans but I still can't shake the ""corniness"" feeling I get when I read Kevin Anderson's books. The one thing that bothers me most about his books is that he has to quote a famous Star Wars line in every other chapter to somehow make us feel like we're actually reading Star Wars characters. I like the introduction of Kyp Duron (about time there was a good (umm...bad?) Jedi with decent powers besides Luke)."
4,Book Review,"After reading the first 2 books of the trilogy I wanted something good to wrap it up, Keven J. Anderson did a good job at that. The book made me want to read more chapter after chapter. Although there were some sad parts like how Luke was suspended between life and death and how Kyp wanted his revenge on the Empire. I really liked the book, how the author described the characters and how they acted. Kyp had the same personality when he was good and evil. The book kept me on the edge of my seat, and i think everybody should read it even if they aren't starwars fans. Even I read the book more than once and it still seemed exciting although I already knew what was going to happen."
4,Great,Purchased this before leaving on mission for Oman. Great guide to the customs and spots in the Sultanate. Highly recommend it!
2,Not the best book for factual history,Book seems to go out of its way to support Islam and demonize other faiths. There is also an underlying liberal agenda to the writing. What is their aversion to just writing the TRUTH?
2,DC Plug with 6' Cord,"When ordering this item, the photo appeared to be a round coax cord with the dc plug. Upon receipt of the item ordered, I was surprised that it had a small flat 2 conductor cord attached. I had ordered 5 of them, with the intended use for my wife's laptop. Her original plug and cord were failing. Well, now I have 5 plug cord assemblies which I doubt that I can ever use."
5,I loved the section on the sixth sense.,"A section of this book, The Sixth Sense, can be used as a means of enabling others to understand the social sense, the perception of social-emotional cues for Autism Spectrum disorders."
2,What's the fuss,"I suppose you shouldn't expect too much for an inexpensive jar of preserved truffle. But it really failed to add anything to the foods we tried it with: eggs, soup. These aren't worth the hype. I once ate at Truffles in Chicago. Now that was an experience. I guess you have to have fresh truffles to capture their essence."
1,Worthless,"A few other people have already noted that George Harrison's solo career has been omitted from this guide. That's right, the former lead guitarist of the Beatles is not represented here. The man whose solo career began with his monumental debut album ""All Things Must Pass"" is not deemed worthy enough to mention in this ""authoratative"" guide. What a slap in the face to a man that gave us so much musically, and spiritually. Emerson, Lake and Palmer are also gone from this guide as well. Their ""Brain Salad Surgery"" album was rated 5 stars in earlier editions of this guide, and rightly so; but now these three incredible musicians apparently no longer merit any consideration. This book claims to rate and review ""More than 10,000 of the Best Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, and Soul Records"". It doesn't."
3,"Bigger, but less informative","This updated guide is somehow much bigger and much less informative than the previous edition. Hip-hop and punk bands are emphasized, but acts from Louis Armstrong to Tom Jones are omitted (my copy does have George Harrison). Worse, the reviews include too much shorthand; you'd better know punk, post-punk, post-millenial punk, metal, new metal, alt-rock, prog-rock, postrock, and so on. It's hard to know what a specific album is about. For hunting down classic albums on the internet, this book is marginally useful."
2,not for an audiophile,quaint little book which will serve well probably for many people. Too many bands with major works and catalogs not represented here for me to consider it anything other than something to browse through.
3,Hastily Cobbled Stones,"There was a time 25 years ago, when as a knock-kneed waif, I lusted after the Rolling Stone Album Guide. The only other option in those days was Lillian Roxon's Rock Encyclopedia and, in OZtralia, Noel McGrath's Australian Rock Encyclopedia. Unfortunately, there is a far better resource nowadays called www.allmusic.com. It is generally more thorough and less idiosyncratic and, on-line, a brilliant means of cross-referencing tracks and genres, although needing an easier navigation of recently viewed pages or the release list. These days, I would even place the British Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music by Colin Larkin ahead of this. Fair dinkum! How can one put in the Moody Blues ahead of Metallica and even George Harrison. Was it some bitter personally motivated omission of vengeance?"
2,Huh? Who's culture is this?,"George Harrison is Not included in the entries. I thought this must have been an accident until I noticed no Deep Purple or Joe Cocker. Rolling Stone has lost a great deal of credibility with this Album Guide. I hope they do a 2nd edition and correct the errors of omission. Until then, go somewhere else to get your reviews."
1,"SERIOUS OMISSIONS : CAPTAIN BEEFHEART, SPIRIT & MORE","While I would rate earlier editions as ""must haves"", this one is a huge disappointment. Other reviewers have noted serious omissions like George Harrison, Pete Townshend, Deep Purple (while the much inferior Black Sabbath has an extended coverage), Fripp and Free. The editors have also missed out on crucial artists like Captain Beefheart (classic albums Trout Mask Replica and Clear Spot) and the widely admired West Coast group Spirit (classic albums 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus and Spirit of 76 with the best cover version of Like a Rolling Stone available). Also missing : Joan Armatrading, Family, John Martyn, Searchers (big influence on Byrds, Petty, REM) and Jack Bruce (incl. the classic Songs for a Tailor). Not to think of the dismissal and low ratings of the great Scott Walker. To quote Captain Beefheart when in his younger days he was working as a vacuum cleaner salesman, and the author Aldous Huxley turned up in the door :""Sir, this sucks!"""
1,"Oh, man...","this thing is dreadful. I haven't read all the reviews posted here, so I don't know if these omissions have been noted, butno solo Pete Townshend? (Evan Dando has a solo entry, for God's sake)no Faces?This is how bad this thing is--I'm a librarian, and once I'd determined that it was a piece of garbage, I thought that I'd donate it to our library, so that someone who was perhaps less informed about rock music might get something out of it.I can't do that to anyone. I've still got this thing."
2,rolling missed the stone,"The reviewrers miss the point of rating albums simply by not including all artist in the review process,several reviews mentioned artist by name as affecting the music that infulenced them,but when you try to get a review of said infulenceses they were missing from this book,also there are many artist of stature missing such as FOGHAT,EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER,10cc and JOE COCKER just to name a few.The genre or genres should have been added to each artist so the reader could better understand the review."
2,Shall be devided in 2 or 3,Too many ommission of the very important artists. This book shall devided into 2 or 3 to cover all !
1,don't believe the hype,reviews are off the top of head throwaways...and you'll be disgusted to find that METALLICA and NINE INCH NAILS have no entries. go look! unbelievable!
2,Incomplete,"It is missing the reviews of the following artists:George HarrisonMetallicaPete TownsendAnd alot of the reviews are the same as the previous edition.What is great about the book is when the reviewer is passionate about a paticular band.Take Television. The guy states that the best stuff is live...then tells you to track down a certain Live album that Rhino put out.Or Joy Division. Getting the Heart and SOul boxset over the other material.When the book makes me curious about an Artist or an Album, then the box is at its best."
4,Omissions CORRECTED,"I was concerned by many of the reviews I read here, so I checked out a copy of the RS Album Guide in Barnes and Noble before I bought one, and noticed that many of the omissions referred to in these reviews have been corrected -- George Harrison and Metallica, for instance, are both in the Guides I saw. I can only imagine that there was a problem with earlier editions.With those problems fixed, I must say that I've been enjoying the book as a resource -- much of the writing is excellent, and a lot of it is very entertaining. Just make sure that the one you buy has these entries in there ..."
2,Too many Omissions,"I bought this book right away, as I have the 92 guide and had been waiting for an updated version to come out. I immediatley noticed the omissions other people have mentioned that seem inexcusable, like George Harrison, Metallica, even Nine Inch Nails. It's also riddled with typos and sloppy writing. In the entry for Ry Cooder, it says to see the review for ""Buena Vista Social Club"" in the soundtracks section. Good luck, as it's not there! It seems like thay rushed this out way too fast without checking for mistakes. I probably won't be buying any more of these guides if Rolling Stone continues to do such a crappy job."
2,Leaving George out had to be an oversight???,"First of all, millions of people still listen to All Things Must Pass (answer to a putz's questions further down). Seriously though, how can Rolling Stone leave out George Harrison? It makes no sense whatsoever. Leaving out Deep Purple is also a shock. Rolling Stone should have been a bit nicer to Queen. It's funny. I like greatest hits collections like anybody else but these are always the best rated albums. I just find that interesting."
2,"based on other reviews, I'd never buy this","Ok I didn't but the book, but I have the first three and so I'm familiar with the format.Let's face it -- With the allmusic guide, what's the point of this book, right?Ok, let's assume you don't have a PC -- I can definitely understand changes in ratings from book to book. And we can all quibble about which albums deserve 4 stars and which deserve 5, etc. That's part of the fun of the book....but omitting Metallica, Interpol, Townsend, Free, Deep Purple, Faces (they just put out a great box set), etc is not fun. Did RS rush this to press for Christmas? I don't remember as many screw-ups in past editions. Maybe I didn't notice? Doubt it.I've always had problems with RS ratings - and the uniformative (supposedly witty) comments - again AMG is much better -- but I'm willing to let that slide. I AM NOT WILLING TO LET SLOPPINESS SLIDE.Please make this the last edition. The magazine isn't what it used to be...and the guide has followed suit."
5,"finally, some decent hip-hop coverage","RS still has a ways to go on their hip-hop coverage in the magazine, but this Album Guide is a big step in the right direction -- especially considering how lame the last one was on rap. Tupac, Eminem, Biggie, Wu-Tang and Jay-Z all get thoughtful write-ups, and there are some welcome surprises on smaller artists -- for instance, the pretty decent Nappy Roots blurb. More authoritative than even the Vibe guide to hip-hop."
5,Wonderful Guide To Music,"THE NEW ROLLING STONE ALBUM GUIDE is a wonderful book, featuring updated ratings of albums reviewed in the previous edition, as well as albums that have come out since. No serious music fan can afford to be without this book."
1,Pompous Garbage,"This is typical RS elitist, pompous garbage. Don't waste your time. Every review I read downplays the significance of the artist's contributions in a most condescending way. I don't know if this is their sad attempt at humor but I found it irritating. It's as if the reviewers were jealous that they never made it as an an artist so they deem themselves fit to sit in judgement of others. Go to the Allmusic guide instead."
1,Amazing ...,"I was curious about this book, so I flipped to the Queen section. After about a page of scathing reviews, there was a paragraph which stated that the decline of the band occurred after Jazz, which included ""Bicycle RaceS"" and was followed by the game, which included ""Another One Bites the Dust,"" credited to bassist Roger Deacon (it's John ... ). After the absolute ignorant condescention which characterized the Queen article, the most offensive thing about the book was that it actually seemed to like The Who. In The Who's defense, though, Tommy, Quadrophenia, and A Quick One were rated lower than many of their other albums. Perplexing to say the least."
1,Poor selection of artists,"First complaint- the arbitrary exclusion af artists they may not personally like- George Harrison, Emerson Lake and Palmer, etc. How can a Beatle be excluded? If you include the other 3, why exclude George?Second complaint- inconsistent reviews.Third complaint- the R rated languagein many reviews.The guide dismisses anything remotely to do with progressive rock as garbage, they laud unpopular rubbish and overall a big disappointment. For the money, they could have done a lot better.The All Music Guides do a lot better!"
1,get allmusic guide or rough guide instead,"I've seen these at the library, you'd be doing yourself a disservice not to get allmusic's guide, or rough guide instead, they sell here for[...] and are much much better. Those are much more comprehensive, and balanced. Rolling Stone doesn't have the best taste in music and they try to please everyone, its too shallow, there's no depth in the coverage, and any album you could discover hear, you'd discover by reading the other two guides as well, regardless of your taste in music. Those people know music better, rolling stone knows pop culture, so with this you're buying the name, not worth it."
1,Get the previous editions!!!,"Think about a classical music guide that omits Mozart, claims that Bach is a mediocre composer, and tries to make you believe that Richard Clayderman's recordings are underrated masterpieces. The guys at Rolling Stone try to remind you how cool and intellectual they are, and how stupid and naive their readers are. The previous editions are less pretentious and much better. Don't waste your time and money with this one."
2,Extremely disappointing...,"I plunked down $20 for this expecting a major upgrade. What I got instead:1. The quality in writing seems to have nose-dived. Rolling Stone seems to want to attract a younger audience so a lot of the reviews are just plain juvenile, written by what seems like high school kids. Compare the feature written on the Stones vs the one in the 1992 edition - no comparison. Note to the editors - good writing never goes out of style.2. Omissions galore! Some I've noticed:- Metallica (huh???)- Pete Townsend- Deep Purple- Queensryche- George Harrison- Scorpions (to be fair they weren't in the 92 edition)I'm sure there's more...either this was a monumental screw-up or they meant to leave these artists out. Either way, it doesn't bode well for the editors there!But that's ok, we got those bastions of rock, 98 degrees and Justin Timberlake!!! Whew!!!"
5,This book is a bible for teenage girls!!,"I first received GIRLTALK when I was 13. Throughout my teen years, I would periodically consult it whenever I had a question or concern that I was unable to talk to my mom about. Unlike other books written for teenagers, this one is not preachy or condescending. I strongly recommend it for all young women who are coming of age."
4,Good information. . . ?,"This book has a lot of useful information to girls ages eleven to eighteen, but some subjects may be a bit advanced for some. There's safe facts about drugs and a helpful quiz to help you get the information about smoking cigarettes. But there's a section in BODY that has information about inserting tampons and things of such sort. This may be advanced fro some, but overall this book is helpful, informative, and very useful if you need to know the facts that some girls aren't so sure about. I give it thumbs up!"
5,Thank you soooo much!!!,"I LOVE this book! I got some of her other books a couple of years ago, but now I'm 14, and I like GIRLTALK because it talks about serious stuff in a funny and friendly way. It's great!! Everybody I have recommended it to likes it too.Michelle B."
1,Stop talking,"Everyone is always raving about how great this book is. All it did was make me feel uneasy and awkward. I definitly don't think 11 year olds should be reading this book. Letters from real people are published in this book about girls being raped, molested, attacked, etc. Of course, when I was 11 and if I read this book I'd be traumatized. I suppose it all depends on your daughter. (...) And after reading different books like this, I can tell you one thing: NEVER give ANY book your full trust. Different health books say different things. (...)"
5,I injoyed this book and recommend it to any teenage girls.,I enjoyed this book and recommend it to any teenage girl from the ages of 12 and up. I like the way that Carol Weston tells what happened to her and then explains to you how to solve it. I hope that Carol writes a nother book like GIRLTALK. If you read this you will to!
2,I've read better,"Ask yourself this: Do you really want your 8 year old daughter reading about sex, rape, drugs, suicide, incest, and abuse? I most certainly don't want my daughter reading those things. And Carol Weston should start expanding her horizons and face the fact that just because SHE thinks something is ""taboo"" doesn't neccesserily mean it is. The only reason why it didn't get one star is because it's a good read if you're really bored."
1,Didn't fit. Had to return.,There were no dimensionial specification on this. I bought it hoping it would fit on the patio door I had in mind. It didn't fit so am having to return it.
5,This is wonderfully modern music,"Maybe not for kids, but then again, kids should definitely be exposed to it! Musically speaking, given the discordant and tone-row sort of structure of this music, it's really very good. Not as difficult to listen to as, say, some of Schoenberg's output. And with the text added on top of the music, sung by the soprano, is just wonderful. More like Crumb, perhaps one could say, than Schoenberg.I was completely entranced, and snatched it up.You and Hugh is also quite good, but the true gem here is ""Green Eggs and Ham"". As another reviewer said, one of the best and more approachable (though I do not mean it's lazy, sophomoric, or not as intelligent) of the tone-row type of music with all sorts of spaces and rests in it. I love it, and I've turned some other friends onto it."
4,"Nice book, but a little pricey","This book is decent, but a bit expensive for what it offers.If you want history and critiques of a bunch of windsor chairs...this is your book.If you want to build one of these chairs, this is not the book for you."
4,You're smart. You'll know which parts to ignore.,"I thought it was just me! Nope, it isn't. And all my peculiarities, my endless pontificating (usually about myself), my hyperawareness of the influence of my actions no matter how miniscule (not recycling a receipt), my exhaustive extrapolations of every possible situation to their usually negative terminus, and my hyper criticism of everything, yeah, they're all indicative of the Hamlet Syndrome. Would you rather stay in college forever instead of getting a ""real"" job? Do you poo-poo people who value material wealth over achieving personal satisfaction and integrity? Does the idea of joining the ""rat race"" of the mainstream disgust you? Yeah? Then you got it too. I feel so weird now. The authors busted my on my bulls--t. Now I can't leave piles of dirty laundry and dishes around, and spending the day reading does not make me a better person than those studio execs in their SUVs. I'm better than them because, wait, give me a second..."
3,Aliens-Gorilla Alien,"The Gorilla Alien was part of the first series of Kenner alien toys when they came out in the early 90's. It started out as a painted blue figure. Then, it was repainted black and silver for its next release under the KB Toy line. The Gorilla alien has movable arms that can grab prey. It also comes with a facehugger and comic book.It's not the most ""fun"" action figure to play with,it's a nice addition to anyone who is collecting these figures."
5,Great concept,"I just bought this for my almost four year old. I like that it holds a charge all night, has two settings and is easy and safe for little ones to charge. The higher setting is a bit bright for night but the low one works great. It seems to be sturdy.Ideal for late night bathroom trips. My little one has even given it a name."
4,Lasted almost 3 years,We got this for our son for his room and it's the perfect night light for him! he loves it and loves to put it out at night by himself. the glow is perfect for his room and i love the settings from dim to bright. with his 3rd birthday coming up we're finding that we're going to have to replace it because after using it nightly for almost 3 years it's now hardly staying on at all. completely worth the money but wish the charge lasted longer!
4,Misleading Description,"While I love the Moby light, the description under product features is misleading. This is NOT the light with the rechargable base. It has the cord in back -- the older version. I returned mine because I already have this model and wanted to upgrade and get the base. This model does not stay on very long when fully charged - 4 hours at best. The newer version allegedly stays on 10 hours. 4 stars for the light in general, Zero stars for the seller."
4,Good for toddler,"I really want to give this a 5 star rating, but within the first month of having this, the button to change the light's brightness quit functioning. As others have mentioned, it is shaped perfectly for her to carry and my 2 year old loves her ""Light Buddy"" (as she calls it). It works very well as a nightlight and she does sometimes ""read"" with it. To my surprise, it is very bright, brighter than I like some nights."
4,Great Resource!,"As a new earth science teacher, I found this text to be an excellent resource. I especially liked the straight forward nature of its content, and clear presentation of the topics covered. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in teaching or learning about the earth sciences."
4,Interesting,"Having visited the region where this book is set I found it mostly interesting for giving a picture of how things used to be there - they are much changed today!For those who haven't been to the Asmat region of New Guinea, this will be a fascinating read. Those inspired to go should be prepared to find it a lot more civilized these days."
5,The Brecker - Gadd Show,"I consider this album as essentially an extended Michael Brecker and Steve Gadd duet. If you like explosive tenor sax solos and pure power jazz / funk drumming, these discs will be heaven. Gomez / Grolnick / Manieri provide fantastic backup; the group is obviously well-rehearsed and ""smokin'"" just as the title says."
5,Top of the Mountain,"All musicians are playing on a very high standard.This CD is Art which is "" at the top of the mountain"".So sad that Michael Brecker and Don Grolnick already passedaway from this Earth. I hope that they might have the chance to be part in theALL TIME JAZZ SUPER STAR BAND in the sky or elsewhere.ALSO:Two Blocks From the Edge"
4,Teaching Tool,"The hat is just what I needed to teach including details in writing. It has lots of components beyond the ""black hat"" category and helps students see the importance of specifics in what they write. It's reasonably priced, and that is important to me as I purchase items for the classroom. I am not using it as another customer might but am happy with the variety of textures and the number of opportunities it gave students to increase their use of effective description and understand how vital details are to appealing writing."
3,Has nothing to do with the sci fi author,"A cool book, if you are looking for a non-fiction about the period form 1760 to 1850. But this has NOTHING TO DO with WILLIAM GIBSON the cyperpunk sci-fi author. This is not that author"
2,what's the point of this phone if I can't get it to sync?!,"I have two charger/USB cradles for my phone (1 at home and 1 at work) but I have so many problems with both cradles trying to get this phone to sync! I have to repeatedly put it in the cradle, hoping that it will be recognized by the computer. Frequently, I get the message ""USB device not recognized."" Then, only about half of the time that it's recognized by the computer is it able to sync. I get errors or it disconnects before fulling syncing. I wish I hadn't spent so much money on this phone."
2,waste of money,"The web service is terrible; it's unusable it's so slow. It isn't worth getting a phone this big and heavy for. The bigger battery fails after a year, no ifs, ands, or buts. The smaller battery doesn't even last a year. I paid extra for the Yahoo POP mail service ($20 year, not bad at all) but it's hard to read your mail on the screen. There is very little search support for games and ring tones. Once you manage to find a tone you want (good luck with that), the easiest way is to download them from the web on your PC, and then hook up your phone to your PC and transfer them, unless you want it to take forever. As a phone, it works well, and gets a good signal, but it's not worth the $500 I paid for it only a year and a half ago. I was an idiot when I bought this phone."
1,Poor design means many lost calls,"Good concept, but so many problems. For example - if you are on a call, it is nearly impossible to pick up another or to put the person you are talking to on hold; when you open the shell to answer a call, if you so much as touch the buttons on the side of the phone (and it is nearly impossible not to), you won't be able to pick up the call. I am unable to pick up approximately 30% of all of my incoming calls and that is simply unacceptable - and I know it is not a problem handset because they have replaced it once and other people I know with it have the same complaints. A total waste of money."
1,Not songs advertised,"I ordered the CD based on the samples and when I received it, it doesn't have the songs listed on amazons site."
2,Is it a travel journal?,"This book had authentic descriptions of live and customs in Turkey and Caucasus in the mid 19th century, beautiful descriptions of nature. Historical accounts of ring accurate and well researched and representatives of different nationalities seem very typical. However I did not see where the author's sympathies lie nor her view on the described events, the writing style is extremely detached. The book felt like a travel journal, an accurate account, lacking passion and the thesis."
1,Lesie Sansone - Walk Away The Pounds - For Your Week,This is not a new DVD although it says it is from 2009. It is a compliation of other DVD's she has done before. I wish I knew this before I bought it because I already have the origianl DVD's. The packaging is new.
1,Horrible Leslie Sansone DVD :(,"I am a HUGE fan of all of her videos except this one.If this had been my first DVD of Leslie Sansone Walk at Home, it would've been my last.There are so many distractions and it was a very calm and not motivating DVD at all. The little twinkle lights in the background and horrible painted pillars. It truly put me to sleep. It wasn't exciting at all. I didn't want to do any of it and I feel ripped off that these were from prior releases (those of which I guess I don't own) I own 5 other DVD's and none of these miles were in any of them. Just going off what a user posted before me.Don't buy this DVD if it's your first one (or at any other time). Buy her 3 mile to start or the 5 mile. My favorite is her 2 very fast miles.You won't be sorry you purchased any of her other DVD's."
5,Amazing set. ALL REGION! NOT Region 2... read on,"First off, this dvd set is ALL REGION, NTSC. It says so directly on the back of the box and plays perfectly in my Region 1 NTSC dvd player.As for this box set. WOW! Palm Pictures went all out. The documentary is very interesting and informative, but I had very little knowledge of Mandela's life before seeing this so keep that in mind. The music cd is stellar. An amazing collection of 26 songs from South African musicians. Add huge booklet and the poster map and you can tell some thought and care was put into this set."
1,Little disappointed,"This video is on the boring side. I don't mind biographies if they are presented with actors presenting the lifeof the subject.THis is just boring,I didn't even finish watching it. I am still interested in Nelson Mandela's life and will probablybuy a different video."
3,Palm World Voices,I already received and this product is very good. I suggest for all people interest in anti-colonizing and politics action
4,Sturdy and durable,"The frame is sturdy and looks like it will last. The cover is made of good heavy material. Assembly was fairly easy but as another review noted it takes some leverage to get a screw into two of the holes because they are close to the frame.Update - I've ordered a few more of these. The covers are great and the frames hold up well. The feet are narrow enough that they sink into the ground, but that isn't a problem if you put something under them."
2,Does not hold a quarter cord of wood,"Read the description the dimensions are 4' X 4' X 14"" or 19 cubic feet. A Cord of firewood is 128 cubic feet. This think can only handle a little more than an 1/8 cord of wood."
2,Disappointment,"First of all, when I restrung the beads, they stained my fingers blue.Second, a few beads are broken.Bad acquirement."
1,Terrible communication,"I have ordered a product, 48 hours has passed and my order has yet to be shipped! I ordered expedited shipping. I have not received any conformation from this vender that I even placed an order? I wished I had paid more attention to this seller!! MY fault, but buyer be ware!! I will never again use Amazon as a recourse for anything!"
1,Very thin and flimsy,"I purchased these earrings for my daughter, but we didn't even get the backs off (which were screw backs, not fraction as was indicated in the description)before the posts and the wings of the butterflies bent. The gold is so thin that it has no substance. The thickness shown in the photos is just a trim, the entire body of the earring is about 1/3 of the thickness.The enamel was a beautiful color, but overall the product was a disappointment."
5,*Sigh* from my childhood...,"I was looking for the big red hardback edition because I remembered it from elementary school when I'd check it out ALL THE TIME from the school library. And I stumbled on it today at a used bookstore in the SPrings. I was so excited! This is a fun, fun, fun book with all its pictures and stories galore! The absolute best, nostalgic fairy tale book and I am so excited to have it in my collection! Its just like I remembered! I love these stories, Bluebeard STILL freaks me out! Love, LOVE this book, if you only get ONE fairy tale book for you, your kid, or someone else, get this one!!!!"
5,Best Collection of Fairy Tales,"This large book has accompanied me through my childhood and to this day, I still read it. It's filled with the best fairy tales. The best part is that they're all still fun to read again and again. Fairy tales aren't limited to little kids, and this collection proves it. They're not all Disney either, some are downright gruesome! (The Brothers Grimm at their best!) There's so much to say about this collection of tales, yet I can't find the right words. Let me tell you that reading this as a child or an adult is a truly magical experience and I'll leave it at that."
1,Hard to believe more followed this debut,"This is probably one of the only books I've bought that I have been unable to finish--not for lack of trying. Why? It's so damn BORING.I know Bond has worked with Clancy but he obviously didn't glean any hints during that time because this book moves about as fast as a three legged turtle.For alternatives to Clancy, I would recommend any books by Richard Herman. I've been gun shy of buying any more of Bond's books after my experience with this one."
1,Disappointed,"Not a usual story that I enjoyed. To far out, not real, repetative, mostly boring. I would not recommend to buy."
3,Mediocre to say the least,"The book was very disjointed and difficult to follow. The plot, although trite, was hard to grasp, even in the end. I would say this novel was OK at best."
3,Average Fair,"I did not enjoy this book as many of the other reviews have. The plot was not really that inventive, these two countries have been shooting at each other over the DMZ for 45 years. Anyway the story just did not grab me, there are better books out there i.e. anything from Clancy. He did offer a lot of good background of the area and weapons. Overall an average story."
2,Dissapointing...,"I was very dissapointed with this book. The characters are unintresting throughout, with minimal development. While at times suspenseful, the plot ends up letting itself down with a very unsatisfying ending, which makes you wonder why you spent your time and money to read this book."
2,To detailed..,The story is painfully slow since the reader must wade through page after page of detail after detail.Reading this book is like wading hip deep in a mud swamp. Slow going..............Not recommended for entertainment reading.
4,An oldie but a goodie,"Red Phoenix was written at the true dawn of the techno-thriller, and as such is somewhat dated, in today's terms. Having said that, it is still more than relevant in today's world. Larry Bond, like Tom Clancy, gives not just the nuts and bolts of a situation, but also goes behind the scenes to reveal some of the motivations behind the actions which drive the main theme of the story. In addition, he creates intense and believable characters which you find yourself truly relating to.All in all, Larry Bond is a true master of the art, and I strongly recommend his work if you like Tom Clancy or similar authors."
4,a well crafted book,"It is not Clancy at his best, but it is a good read, and well worth the $2.99 I spent for it in the Kindle edition.It is a little dated. I think it was originally released in the late 80s. I read it back then. It was a good read then as well.The characters are generally believable, as is the action, and the story line, at least for the most part. I could nitpick a lot of things along the way but the bottom line is that I enjoyed reading the book, and that is what I really care about.I thought the ending was kind of goofy, although the demise of the two NK generals was totally believable to me.Pretty good combat scenes, both air combat and ground combat, even if some of it was a little out there.The South Koreans are portrayed in a way I did not especially like, but it is fiction and the author is entitled to write as he sees fit."
4,THE SECOND KOREAN WAR,"Written in 1989, this absorbing and extremely plausible tale of the second Korean War should be of interest not only to military history buffs, but also to those simply looking for a good technodrama. Dogfights, submarines, aircraft carriers, antisubmarine warfare, infantry tactics, the ROK army, the US Marine Corps, politics and politicians... are realistically and accurately portrayed. Many of the actions which occurred are reminiscent of those which marked the first Korean Conflict including not only the tactical war but also the operational state of the military. The one thing which I didn't care for was the plot involving Tony and Anne. It was superfluous. Its deletion would not have affected the story at all. Otherwise and interesting book worthy of reading! This book should be of special interest to military personnel on assignment to Korea."
3,Not bad,"A good, fun read. The usual right wing politics, but if I am going to read this genre, I expect it"
4,Good Read,Was lost at first but then it started fitting together. Lot of mis-spelling and grammatic errors (like mine) Poor editing?
4,One of the early best...,"One of the early books in the genre, I liked it particularly at the beginning, but the ending seemed oddly shortened to me. The description of the flight of F-16, jibes so well with Falcon 3.0 which I played incessantly when I first was reading this. The description of Kevin the infantry lieutenant was the best!"
4,"If you like action, read this!","Red Phoenix is one of the best books I've read. Put the movies Platoon, Top Gun, Crimson Tide, and Red October together and Red Phoenix is what you get. Except it's a book, and your free to let your imagination go. I'm not completly finished yet but so far, it's great. They should make this into a well made movie. It starts off a little slow, developing the plot and what not, but once the action hits, it really hits."
3,Didn't need any romance,I liked the detailed battle descriptions but the romance aspect felt perfunctory and forced. Of course the whole weakening of US and ROK forces is needed to even make an invasion plausible. OK for the genre.
5,easy to read,"Zochert writes well enough that it's not a dull biography. He moves things right along and truely tries to be accurate and fair. It's a very compelling story and makes me want to return to Mansfield, Missouri to see Laura and Almanzo's home again. I was there once, and now know that I missed many things. I was never fond of the Little House series as a child, but can now appreciate the story of Laura's life."
4,A Picture of a Lost Time,"I found this book at a library book sale and, being a major fan of the Little House series, I picked it up (plus fifty cents is not a bad price for a used book). I'll admit, the author did use some purple prose & got a little overly goopy in his descriptions, but it's a good book. Mostly, though, it made me sad to realize that I will never have the chance to meet any of these people and will only be able to glimpse their rich & interesting lives through re-reading Laura's books. Life was very hard in those times & I was very saddened to read about the deat of Laura's son and her little brother. How a family with four daughters could end up with only one grandchild back in those days kind of amazes me, but it happens. The book was rich in lots of historical detail, including lots of info about periods of Laura's life that are not written about in her series. I can recommend it, but I dare you not to cry at the part where Pa dies!"
3,Not a very credible biography,"While this isn't a terrible biography, Zochert seems to confuse some of the facts with what he's seen on the television show. Even the cover shows characters drawn to look like the actors rather than the actual people. Check this one out of your local library and spend your money on the better book--Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder."
1,A Sucker Born Every Minute,"This is so poorly written that I hate admitting I own it. From the back cover to the very end, Zochert creates a fantastic and shoddily researched book that's only redeemable feature is the pictures. It might go over well with the legions of Little House TV freaks (the picture on the cover looks like Little Joe Cartwright), but it is a definite dud for anyone who wants a literate biography.The more one reads about Laura and Rose, the darker the picture of Laura becomes. I love her and the fantasy she's created, but when you start digging deeper, you find that Mama Bess was far from perfect. You really do feel sorry for Manly, and as he told his daughter, he had been a failure at most things in his life. I wonder who let him feel that way.Willow"
5,Those who love Laura will love this book.,"When my grandmother began reading the ""Little House"" books to me when I was 8 I don't think she had any idea what she was starting. Until I read ""Laura:The Life of Laura Ingalls Wilder"" I could only imagine what Laura, her family, and the other characters from her books were like, how they effected each other and even how they looked. It was so exciting for me to open the pages of this book and see for the first time the beautiful young woman I had come to know through the years. Donald Zochert's research and care are evident on every page. He transports us into Laura's world and gives us even more details of her fascinating life."
3,Definitely geared toward younger teens.,"I wish that Karen Conzoneri's review had been posted before I purchased this book. I think ""Laura"" is filled with interesting facts and stories, (I especially enjoyed the additional background on Charles and Caroline), but I just could not get past the fact that it was written for 11-14 year olds. I would definitely recommend this book for that age group, but I'm still on the lookout for one written for adults."
5,Genius,This show never gets old (even if the main character is over 900)! I love that each episode has a conclusion so you don't get that soap opera effect. Great writing with witty dialog.
5,good season,"I am enjoying the second season. Not as scary as the first. Loving the new Doctor. I can't wait to watch the rest of the season, and get on with the next."
3,Miss Christopher Eccleston,"Christopher Eccleston > David TennantI started to like David Tennant in Episode 5, The Girl in the Fireplace. Yeah, it took 4 episodes to warm up to him, and he didn't do well in the his Christmas debut because he was unconscious so long.I think the rave reviews are for other things Tennant does in future seasons.I just think Eccleston was perfect and wish he would have lasted longer. If the series started with Tennant, I probably would still love it, but Eccleston is in a class of his own.Season 1 > Season 2 in terms of stories, anyway."
1,Boring!,"Really quite a letdown after the previous episode. From epic to so dull. I appreciate that they were trying to show the Doctor from other's point of view, but it was one of the most disappointing episodes I've watched so far."
3,BRING BACK CHRISTOPHER ECCLESTON!!!!,"I am absolutely crushed that they got rid of Christopher Eccleston. He is/was BRILLIANT! If the new guy doesn't ""do it"" for me like Christopher did, by the 4th or 5th episode, I'm out. I don't know about the ""new guy"", but I guess my ""distant cousins"" in Britian, (my grandfather's family immigrated to the US), do know, and he irritates the heck out of me. I WANT CHRISTOPHER ECCLESTON BACK!...but I guess the Americans did get him to a certain degree since he's been in so many American movies. He's a fantastic actor. You can truly see his passion for it. Thank you, Mr. Eccleston for sharing your gift with us! Best Wishes!"
2,ughhh,"I am in love with Dr. Who... and this quite nearly ruined it. Even if you have prime membership, IT'S NOT OWRTH WATCHINGskip itseriously. I love every other episode. I am actually, quite addicted to it. I saw the whole first season in 4 days. I have prime, so that is good, but other wise, its a terrible episode. Don't watch it."
4,most depressing episode ever.,"why does the doctor not save his mistress? this is worse than the girl that waited. this is the girl that died, and existed. how is the doctor able to deal with this? is it the curse of living forever, even though each lifetime of his is 300 years? the character disappoints me."
5,One of the best episodes ever.,"I have been watching Dr Who since the early 80's, I stared when the fourth Doctor first met Sara Jane Smith, and followed their adventures to the end.I love seeing this reunion of the Dr and Sara Jane."
5,Excellent! Love the 10th Doctor.,"I was a little skeptical after the fist season ended since Christopher Eccleston was no longer going to be The Doctor. I really loved him. But, since I had become a fan of the series, I decided to give the 2nd season a try, starting with the Christmas episode...David Tennant's first episode.I am so glad I gave it a try! David Tennant's interpretation of the 10th Doctor is superb. He is great fun to watch. If you are not sure about this season, give this episode a try ... you won't be sorry!"
4,Interesting,"I got this as a present from my sister. I think it came in a set, I don't remember. I got the red one, and I had expected it to be red as lipstick; thank goodness it wasn't. It gives a nice pink color to your lips. I was surprised it smelled a bit like an orange (or maybe that's the smell of a kiwi?), but the lip gloss is pretty nice. Thicker than most one I have come across, but it smoothes everything nicely. I prefer the other flavors better, but this product does the trick for dry, chapped lips."
3,lip ointment,It is fine but quite honestly I have used much cheaper basic lip balms that have worked just the same.
3,great balm with bad taste,"The balm is really good in terms of softening my lips, but the taste is a bit disgusting. If you don't mind the taste during the fist 1/2 hour, is a great lip balm."
3,Ok,"I just received my dallas mats today. The mats are wonderful but the packaging wasent. When i opened the mats, they appeard used. There was NO tags on them at all, the tag was at the bottom of the bag and was barely legible. Im a person that if something is new I like to see tags on it (if im buying it for someone else via internet). And a word of advice, if you order the product make sure you ARE home when the delivery truck comes. I came home to find my package under my door matt. Because of this the pakage was filthy dirty!!! The product was also packaged in a heavy duty bag-type packaging and was satisfactory."
4,It's been over a month and I still like it.,"First, one or the reviews mentioned about the mats getting dirty real easy. That is true. It attracts mud and dirt like a magnet. You have to clean it often enough so that it would look good every time your ride your car.Second, high maintenance item. If you want it to look good, keep it clean. But for a quick clean up, just hit it to a chain link fence and all the dirt will fall off. If you have a dirt driveway, this is not for you.Third, strong and sturdy. I just hit it on my neighbors chain link fence and the dry dirt will fall off. It seems strong enough to handle the beating, but we'll see.Fourth, the packaging was bad. The other reviewers mentioned it came in a box. Mine showed up in a plastic bag. This is why I gave it, four stars."
3,Pilates/ Flex Bands,"A friend and I ordered the Flex bands and pilates workout to start exercising in the evenings. The bands were exactly what we needed and had the extra length, some that we looked at were much too short. We have only had them a couple of weeks, so the (body) results aren't in yet. Ha."
4,Typical flex bands,"Good for shoulder stretching exercises. These are latex bands, seem durable enough. Not much else to say but does the trick."
4,A solid selection,"There are surprisingly few Dutch books out there for intermediate readers. This is a handy guide which provides a brush-up of basic grammar and introduces some more complex ideas. My only qualm is the Fenoulhet picked some very depressing reading selections, something more upbeat would be better. There is a companion cassette, although I have not heard it and Amamzon does not carry it."
2,Plastic construction and it shows,"So far I've only used this to fill cream puffs, despite being an icing syringe set, but I will believe the info here will be relevant regardless of what the application. When using the syringe, the plastic top will often come off if the filling requires a decent amount of force to push out. This causes the entire bottom half (tube & filling) to fall down. I would imagine that if this is being used to decorate a cake, it would make quite a mess! It is really hard and frustrating trying to secure the top lid to the tube."
2,"cheap plastic breaks, rendering useless","I had success using this product until the plastic chipped and cracked at the spot where you screw on the plunger. It is too brittle. What a pity that they wouldn't have made the cylinder more durable given that it's the simplest part of the apparatus. I feel bad about throwing away the rest of the parts, but the thing is now useless."
2,Let the buyer beware,Although the title says this is the best of American Splendor it doesn't feature any of the R. Crumb illustrations. This compilation only features stories published in the last ten years or so. A mayor dissapointment. The second star is only because of the sheer quality of the material that is there. Just don't expect a proper retro-spective.
2,What was I thinking?,"OK, by now it seems aparent that other reviews here could be of those who just might be personal friends of Nukleon? Anyone with one ear can tell that this cd is just ordinary. Don't get me wrong, I have a ton of electronic music, several hundred cds. This music however sounds like a teenager in his garage fooling around on a mini studio. (Terrible Twink Tunes!) There's just so much of this crap out there. It has a cool cd cover, but no sustinance. If your musical tastes are mature and developed, I'm afraid you will be instantly dissapionted. Humm.....is it not curious how all of the 5 star reviews here happend to mention Morrisey? Who, buy the way, used real instruments!"
3,Sterling Silver Elephant Charm,"The charm is very nice and small. I liked it myself but was bought for my daughter. She wanted STERLING ""SILVER"" it has a goldest tint which may be caused by the red stones, I don't know. But for her; she was not happy cause it just didn't look good on her Sterling Silver bracelet. I sent it back and ordered 2 others (Heart & Cross). She very happy now.If you aren't as picky as she, the Elephant is very lovely and I myself would have kept it if it had been for me. It's small & dainty just right for a girl who likes elephants or is a 'BAMA' fan. Has a good split ring on it to hook to bracelet which also is a plus..As for me I would rate it a four but since it was for my daughter I asked her to rate it, Sorry, she gave it a 3; Just ok."
5,THE BEST,THIS GRILL IS THE BEST ! THE FELLAS AND I HAD MORE ROOM FOR THE BEER. COOKS BURGERS AND DOGS QUICKLY.
5,this is great,I love this grill. We take it to Nascar events all over. I feel like a traveling salesman for it because everybody wants to see how it works. I love it. buy two or three to sell wherever you go.
3,Mistakes,My dad bought this book when it came out in 1982 for [price] in the U.S.A. (the price is printed on the back of the book) and he and I both realized that a lot of chords were wrong some were even left out and even a few lyrics were wrong or missing and it fell apart rather quickly ...
2,Robert kaplan need more research,The book takes a view of one side approach. I lived in Ethiopia in the 1980's and most of the staff Mr. Kaplan talked about never happened. The historical facts are missing. Emperor Menelik was not the first Amhara king there was Emperor Tewdros form Gojam which is the main Amhara region who united Ethiopia from Red Sea to Showa. Reading the book makes me think that the author had a good close relationship with then gorilla fighters now the people in power in Ethiopia and its former province Eriteria.
2,Not one of his best works,"I was not particularly impressed with this book. Kaplan tend to repeat the same thoughts (and phrases) in each chapter. Obviously, he did not want to do much research into the area as the same handful of sources are referred to. It is a shame that such short shrift is given to this region as it is one continuously neglected by the popular media."
2,Dark Moon Rising - Lousy effort,"I'm a big fan of the werewolf movie genre and always keep an eye out for lycanthropically themed films. Don't waste your cash on this. Cheaply made, poorly acted and with the most unconvincing werewolves ever - I stopped watching halfway through. Go back in time and watch Dog Soldiers (made on a shoestring budget and genuinely spooky at times), or even Stephen King's own werewolf tale: Silver Bullet."
1,The Real Artimus Pyle Should Sue These Clowns,"The music is decent at best. Nothing original going on here. The singer just sucks!! I actually thought it was a joke when he started ""singing"".Hard to take these guys seriously."
2,THis is a fair set.,I just received this set of wrench. The set has a lot of spot of rust. The quality is doubtful. It is made in India. I'd like Amazon to list where the product is made. This set is far from 5 stars quality which I saw in Lowes or Home depot.
5,"A fascinating, insightful read","Greg Behrman's Invisible People is a riveting, well-written account of how the AIDS epidemic has shaped the global landscape. Personally, I was astounded by the statistics in the preface --25 million dead, 40 million currently infected, 8,000 people dying of AIDS every day--and gripped by Behrman's description of the heroes and villians in our battle against one of the greatest killers the world has ever known. This is an important book."
2,Only three episodes,"Includes Mixed Martial Arts, Fighting Back, and Special Ops. Interesting shows, but does not include the ep that Bren Foster appeared in so very disappointing in that respect. Wish those eps would be released as it's quite spectacular and interesting."
3,Ehh....theres better DVD's out there,"As an active martial artist, I bought this along with several other DVDs.This DVD was okay, but personally I would recommened the Fight Quest or Human Weapon series first. Both are a bit cheesy at times, but are more entertaining with still a bit of education to be offered.I didn't even finish watching this DVD, but thats just me. I guess it depends on what you are wanting."
5,Fight Science,"Extremely informational, interesting, especially if you have a youth in sports. It defines physical as well as technical and science explanations on the human body strength. It's really cool. Thanks National G."
1,ZorBeez a Dud,Just plain junk. Don't waste your money. Use an old bath towel and get better results.
1,need negative stars to rate this item,"this thing is just nothing...maybe not the original product. we have seen lot in the advertisement, but after using it surprise surprise that was a lie."
1,scamscamscam,"Horrible. Just horrible. While I did receive the product in a timely manner, the product is seriously nothing but a number of large pieces of felt. Not absorbant, not at all what the infomercial shows. It seriously blows my mind that this company hasn't been sued and the product taken off the market...absolutely do. not. waste. your. money. Hopefully you'll find this site before I did...believe me...it's a scam."
1,Worst product I ever purchased,"This is advertised as having enough power to hold 20 oz. of liquid, easily clean up spills, etc. It is a large piece of felt material and it doesn't absorb anything, it just smears liquid all over the place. And don't put it in the washing machine as also advertised as being ok, I spent hours getting the lint out of my clothes and washing machine. Don't buy and don't accept a free one either."
3,Good but not great,It was my impression that when I went to soak up the water after I washed my car that the water would be all soaked up. Instead it absorbed most of it but still left a lot behind and so I had to go back to the old way of getting out the towels and drying off my car like I did before. What's the point of using them if I still have to do the same thing I did before I bought them? Maybe they will work better with something else like spills or cleaning windows.
1,DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worse product I have ever bought! I bought it because my dog has a lot of 'accidents' and have been spending a fortune on paper towels. I still have to use paper towels to pick up the spills these stupid rags wont 'absorb'! I wish I would have came to amazon and read the reviews, then maybe I wouldnt have made such a costly mistake:( I've use 2 towels and the rest have been put in the closet where they are doing more good collect dust then they so absorbing any sort of liquid. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! I will give you mine if you want them, just pay for shipping costs!"
1,The money I paid would absorb better!,"These only absorb if they are soaking in water... They won't wipe up a spill even if wet themselves. I've washed them, and then they became nearly as good as a kitchen towel, and it keeps me from using a kitchen towel to wipe up liquids that stain. Of course, shop towels do the exact same thing, only much less expensively. So, I won't try Sham Wows either, becouse I believe it's all hype."
1,Not as advertised!,We purchased this product because we bought into the advertising being broadcast on television. For use in drying a car they are pretty worthless and they leave behind fibers which adhere to the car. They may work better in a different environment but certainly not for the purpose we wanted them for.
1,Zorbeez Garbage,"ZorbeezZORBEEZ CLOTHSZorbeezI wish I could give a negative star!.This is a blatant case of false advertizing. These are just pieces of felt that have no absorbing power at all. Even small drops of water are just pushed around. And the special ""sponge"" is even worse and is small and looks nothing like the one advertized. Don't order these even if they are free!"
3,not everything is as it seems,"yes they do absorb better than a paper towel, but so does a kitchen towel. they also have a chemical odor that doesn't wash out. theyr'e not supposed to drip, but get them wet enough and they do. they don't seem to soak up much more than a kitchen towel."
1,NOT as advertised!!,"I agree with the other reviewers. Although the cloths do absorb liquid to some degree, they leave behind fibers and absolutely will not produce a dry surface. The commercial shows a customer drying dishes-- ridiculous! All they do is push the water around."
5,perfect,Item was on time and it was a great description. Everything was as expected and I couldn't have asked for anything more.
3,The Ten Basic Principles of Good Parenting,"I read about the first 10 pages and thought... really? I could learn more from a youtube video and get it over with faster. Maybe someone that's a bigger fan of reading will enjoy this more. I just couldn't get into it. I guess to be a good parent, you need to learn patience, take deep breaths, act interested when they are trying to tell you something, because to them it's really important... feed them good foods... say I love you often and give them time out if they are really pushing the limits. And on a personal note, teach them how to pray and to respect their creator. There you go... you don't even have to read the book now."
2,It wasn't worth the time I spent reading it,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was hoping to see the scientific evidence that gives weight to Dr. Steinberg's advice, but there wasn't a single study mentioned in the whole book. Instead, it was just one cliche of an advice after another. It could have come from my neighbor or my mother-in-law. The author does nothing to persuade me that if my parenting beliefs differ from his, it is I who is wrong. In other words, if you agree with a particular advice, you feel that you already know this; if you disagree with it, nothing in the book makes you change your mind."
5,Very useful,"I had to get this for a parenting class, but ended up using it as a resource for 3 different classes! Very handy if your a marriage and family studies major."
2,Questanable product,"4 days after install and only 4 hours of use , (all in one might) Passenger side gos out.Switched the bulbs around and the bulb is good.Transformer is shot , and only after 4 hours of use.Warranty card enclosed states 1 year warranty but there is NO INFO on who or where to contact for this coverage.No Address , Phone or Email .Very questionable company and unreliable product .Am trying to reconcile with supplier ."
5,lush down-tempo sounds,"This album has several classics - the cleric and E.V.A. amongst them. But aside from the great tracks is the warm, lush, and peaceful sounds (not quite ambient) that bring a sense of meditative calm and reassuring warmth. This is a electronic album, not a dance album. Buy this to chill or sleep to."
4,Heights Of Abraham - Electric Hush,"The Heights of Abraham's second album, Electric Hush, isn't quite as catchy or poppy as their first, Humidity, but it's a strong album in its own right. Instead of pop songs, they create longer, more ambient tracks. ""High Time,"" for example, is an extended track at drifts along at its own leisure, like smoke on the wind. There's also, on the whole, much less singing by Jake Harries and more use of his voice as texture instead. ""What's the Number"" drifts off into the atmosphere and ""Olive Branching"" gets back to earth with a house beat. ""E.V.A."" is about as blissful as you can get, and ""Make Love"" casts an ambient glow before it chugs into business. Even if Electric Hush is not as immediately engaging as Humidity, it's worthwhile in its own regard."
3,Sailing the world with Heights Of Abraham by PRNJ,"Electric Hush was for me the soundtrack to the most joyful trip I ever had, :-) I was sailing around the world, from South America to Russia, and the soft-waving sound of that record still remains in my mind like an image of the dolphins I saw in the ocean. Indeed, there's a track called dolphins, very cute! E.V.A is a mother-of-pearl, rainbow-like track. My friends all say that Electric Hush is much better than any other Pork release, I can't say that, but I can say it's one of the best, unconventional work. Sportif sounds like Fila Brazillia's Luck Be A Weirdo Tonight, it might be just because they where produced at the same studio, by the same guys, I think :-)I would tell you that this CD is worth the price if you are planing to sail away, or if you have time to relax in the weekend, with your girl/boyfriend. Just remeber: Get it slowly. ""JAH, RASTAFARI""PRNJ"
5,Fast Delivery & Great Book Condition,"I bought this book for an English Literature course at university and it was exactly what I needed - annotations and an explanatory preface and conclusion.Most importantly, the book arrived early and was in great condition. Totally satisfied with the seller."
3,OK...but not Stellar,"This 'Planets' won't make you barf, squirm, or faint...but neither will it satisfy. It lacks the bigness that you want in The Planets, opulence and sweep.This does not mean that if you randomly find this cd cheap, which is likely, that you will dislike it. But, considering the fact that there are so many other top-notch Planets performances out there, this one just doesn't get the job done.But there's this: this performance pulls itself up as an option because it includes ""Pluto, the Renewer""...an epilogue to Holst's creation by british composer Colin Matthews. It works, it sounds Holstian, it sounds like a 'Planet'...but it isn't terribly interesting.Also included is a nice performance of ""A Somerset Rhapsody""...for the Planets this isn't that great, but considering that it is the cheapest performance available of the curiousity ""Pluto"", then I would get it for that."
3,Synosis,"20th century history as we know it is a lie. Aliens have been among us since the 1940's, but a government cover-up has prevented the public from knowing this. As the series progresses, we follow John Loengard and Kim Sayers as they attempt to thwart numerous plans of the alien Hive, most of which are tied to historical events and figures. In addition, the pair must stay one step ahead of a covert government agency, Majestic-12, tasked with fighting the aliens while maintaining the conspiracy of silence."
2,too complicated,"I gave up on this one after 20 minutes of trying to learn guzillion new moves every 3 minutes! Plus, it's way too fast!Maybe once you do it often enough it gets more fun and you can follow the moves well but for me it was horrible! I love mixing things up and I love a challenge, I love changing my workouts and try new things every day but I don't want to spend weeks learning the moves cause I get bored doing same workout anyway.Hated it."
3,Average,"This is my first The Firm workout video so I cannot compare it to the others. I found this video to be really fast paced and at times hard to follow. The workouts in themselves did get me sweating and feeling accomplished afterwards. The moves do take some time to get used to. Overall, I wasn't very impressed with this video. I have had better results with Jillian Michaels or Leslie Sansone videos."
4,good workout when I have limited time,"I like the Firm series, and I was looking for something that I could do in 30-40 minutes, especially when I don't have an hour or more to exercise. I also wanted something that didn't require lots of excess equipment. This workout has 4 different workouts, one that uses a band that I find uncomfortable and a little awkward. However I like the other cardio and weight segments and feel like it does give a total body workout, I would rate my fitness level as moderate, and this is just about right for working up a sweat without overdoing it."
2,Just a duplication of other DVD's I already had,"I sure wished I had looked into this before ordering - half of it is just a duplication of older dvd's that I already had. I wasn't thrilled with the rest of it, just too much to follow and too little benefit. I have most all of the firm videos and this is not one I will use again."
1,Not a fan,"This is the most annoying work out dvd I have ever owned. I liked NONE of the 5 instructors on the dvd. They move too quickly from move to move, it is impossible to keep up with. Frustrating and not fun at all. Therefore it is in the garage sale pile. Try ""10 minute solutions"", you are sure to find something you like."
1,too much skin,"The Firm has always delivered great workouts that are effective, but as a mom of young boys, I don't understand why the instructors need to be so exposed. It's inappropriate to have to be staring at half-dressed women in your workout. Super disappointed. If I could give zero stars I would."
5,great dvd for quick workouts,"I bought this dvd over a month ago and have been using it 3-4 times a week. I love it because it's fun, gets results and the workout times are 25-35 minutes which are perfect for a busy mom. I haven't lost much weight so far (probably because I'm gaining muscle), but I have lost about 6 inches. Total body time crunch and Hard core fusion are my favorites on the dvd, but I also really like the cardio party. THis is a REALLY fun workout dvd for people needing quick effective workouts."
2,No makeover for me,"I bought this DVD thinking it'd lead me towards a total body makeover, as the title suggested. Unfortunately, all the workouts were too light for me. So I did two workouts one after the other and still nary broke a sweat. There was not much exertion, and whatever exertion there was wasn't long enough. The DVD with workouts of about half an hour each that did give me a total body makeover was Jillian Michaels' Ripped in 30.I had a lot more mileage from The Firm's Calorie Explosion, it's fabulous."
4,Firm Believer Since 1998,"I have been exercising with The Firm since 1998. The routines are easy to follow and are well-scripted, so the excellent cues and coaching really help you learn the sequences. You will always get a great workout. These routines are about 30 minutes each which I add to my own set of yoga and exercises. Because I am doing more strength training now, I like Hardcore Fusion the best. The Cardio Party is a little redundant, but it's easy and you can throw in some variations of your own if you want. Overall, I am a big fan of The Firm. They are the best for beginners because of the combination moves and scripting. I'm not in their ""Firm Believer"" program, but I still use the VHS tapes from the early 90's (Low-Impact Aerobics with Janet Jones). The quality of the tapes is outstanding and they have stood the test of time. These routines offer the best challenge for an effective workout."
5,Show Your Own is hilarious!,"Show Your Own was great. It's funny and it's different. Through conversations and screenplay segments, the author examines the problems inherent in the depiction of manic-depressive behavior, generates interest in the screenplay, and tells something of the mid-life events that influenced the central character's writing of the script. Finally, the book concludes with a completed screenplay revised in light of the critiques and suggestions made in the earlier discussions.The descriptions of mood and emotion are convincing, and the depictions of mania capture that state as well as anything I've ever read. Additionally, I enjoyed the book's portrayal of legal education from a teacher's point of view. The screenplay could be the basis for a good movie. More than anything, however, the book is hilarious!"
3,disappointing compared to the live show,"I saw ward open for bright eyes and was amazed by his charisma, technical virtuosity, and fascinating revival of the blues. in a way, his crazy look and vocals reminded me of isaac brock, though musically you could say they have little in common. however, when i listened to the cd on the way home i got vaguely interesting acoustic and folk noodling, like a much better mason jennings. it's still a pretty good album but i would recommend seeing him live instead. the man clearly has some soul."
5,wonderful surprise,"What a find! This is an awesome book. The photos are spectacular, the directions spot-on. My expectations were FAR exceeded by the excellency of this book. 5 starts"
5,Just what I needed!,"Got at first to use on a Fuji Finpix 5000.Got my SLR and with the extra ring, fit right on my Nikon D70.Wheew!!"
5,One of the true classics of the Hammer period,"If you have never seen a version of ""The Mummy"", this one is the one you must choose. Except for the ""Horror"" part of the movie, the tale transports us briefly and through flashbacks into the magical, wonderful, and at times dreadful world of Ancient Egypt. It tells us of a hopeless love, between Karis, a High Priest and his Princess Ananka. When she dies, he commits the ultimate sacrilege and violates her tomb to bring her back to life. Unfortunately he is discovered and punished to be buried alive. He will be the silent, but deadly guardian to Ananka's tomb. This is just the premise. The way the entire narrative flows, the actors play and the tension rises while the Mummy is unleashed, make this the best version ever made. Karloff's version pales in comparison. Although scary, that version is very slow paced and does not really offer us the glorious insight in a world we know nothing about, except that it was colorful."
1,Warner totally destroyed the movie,"In overmatting Fisher's masterpiece, Warner totally destroyed the magnificent images created by Jack Asher. Furthermore, the colors of the pre-recorded VHS tapes sold in Great-Britain are much more vibrant and flamboyant, but it's the cretinous ""wide-screening"" of the image that totally ruins this DVD."
4,reviewers who think they know something about aspect ratios,"fact number 1:in order to be ""enhanced for 16:9"" the picture ""has"" to be 16:9-that works out to 1:78 aspect ratio.fact number 2:fisher was working with 35mm film stock wich was then matted at 1:66 , the most popular format all over europe.fact number 3:the north american standard for non-scope films was 1:85 witch is the full 35mm aspect ratio.fact number 4:warner is not in the habit of taking inferior euro-transfers (4% too fast as a half-assed way of synchronisingcelluloid with video)ex:the mummy on pal video is 85 mins insted of 88(correct running time for both celluloid & NTSC).fact number 5:there is always a little more picture on the film stock then will ever be seen in theaters or video.otherwise the number of goofs reported would astronomical.so in conclusion don't be alarmed by naysaywers bitching about aspect ratios , 9 times out of 10 they know less than you."
5,Along came the raggedy man!,"The Mummy is one of the best of-the-best from the pinnacle of the Hammer Films classic horror movie era. The stars are Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, two actors who really knew their art. These movies were crafted without any of the excessive and senseless blood-and-gore that is signature of so many contemporary thrillers which now-a-days fail to scare us but only manage to gross us out. Check out the raggedy man, aptly played by the great Christopher Lee as he creeps out of the bog and ambles along to carry out his nefarious charge. His shuffling pace is slow but sure and quite unstoppable even when Peter Cushing fires at point blank range with one of his trusty English double-rifles! One of my favorites from Hammer Studios. My only regret is that I couldn't get it in DVD!"
3,Stylish Hammer horror with some good moments,"After a succession of masterful gothic horrors (Curse of Frankenstein, Horror of Dracula, Hound of the Baskervilles), Hammer Studios next turned their attention to the infamous Mummy.In my opinion, this lacks the brilliance of Hammer's earlier genre offerings, but is most notable for several unforgettable images that remain imprinted on the mind long after the film is over. Apart from the striking visuals, this is a solid, but fairly standard slice of Hammer horror."
1,The Mummy Is A Stinker,"If you are looking for a great entertaining Mummy movie, this is not it. I'm normally a fan of Hammer films, but this movie goes on and on forever, repeating itself, retelling (seemingly endlessly) the background of the mummy. You see very little of the mummy himself, and when you do, he is about as stimulating as a bowl of oatmeal. I found Universal's 1940's series of mummy movies much more entertaining. It was a real disappointment to see a Hammer film that was so slow paced and dull. If I had seen this movie first, I would have never purchased it. I bought it based on my enjoyment of other Hammer films. I recommend you pass on this one, unless you just have a burning desire to either own all of the Hammer films, or all of the mummy films."
5,Hammer does the Mummy,"This is Hammer Studio's attempt at redoing the Mummy. The story has Kharis (Christopher Lee) as an Egyptian priest that is executed when he tries to revive his Queen Anaka. Centuries later a team of Egyptologist (Peter Cushing as John Banning) find the tomb of Anaka, Kharis is brought back to life and is driven to kill the ones that disturbed Anaka's tomb. Kharis recognizes Banning's wife as the exact look-alike of his long lost queen and his passion for her brings about his destruction for a second time.The movie is well written, Lee is a superb as the mummy, Technicolor gives the film a warm feeling and there is plenty of action and adventure to keep the viewer's attention."
4,Torn From the Tomb... to Terrify!!,"In this, 1959's third installment from Hammer Studios, Christopher Lee dons the moldy bandages for a vengeful rampage across the Victorian countryside. Lee plays Kharis, an Egyptian priest returned from the afterlife, searching for archaeologist John Banning (Peter Cushing) and his expedition, to exact revenge on Banning and his team, for desecrating his beloved Princess Ananka's tomb. Directed by Terrence Fisher, this film has good lighting and music score, as well as costumes and make-up, which brings that classic element of horror to the screen, that we all know and love. This is a definite keeper for the Hammer fan, (the price is certainly right,) but I think we can all agree, that Karloff will be best known for owning the role of 'The Mummy'."
5,The Mummy,"It's a classic I've always loved! As a child, I had enjoyed the story that unfolds about how the mummy came to be."
3,classic,this movie was for my film class and it was a great movie for it's time i had to compare it to a 1999 movie the mummy. what a big difference. The was great for the project.
1,Not Truly Copper,"My bedroom has a Morroccan theme, and dark woods, blues and browns, and copper accents were key.I was elated to order this set that said copper, only to find the sheets are indeed...orange.Still I tried them, and they wrinkle far too easily, and shrink even when washin on cold and delicate as guided.So if truly looking for copper colored sheets, keep looking, and tell me where to find them!"
4,Tweezerman Men's Shaving Brush.,"Now this is a good shaving brush. The badger hairs mix up a very good lather with either shaving soap or regular soap. I prefer ""Octogon Soap."" Why? Because it deep cleans your skin as it smoothens your beard for shaving. The Tweezermans brush also spreads a thick, rich, lather uniformly over your face; better than a clumsy can of shaving cream which I always hated! Men, sometimes a step backwards is a good step! This brush is a very good buy."
4,"For the price, a great value!","I'm very happy with this brush and I've been using it daily now for a month. It whips up a great lather and I've tried it with Taylor's Eton College cream, and a concoction of regular old soap mixed with Kiss My Face shaving cream and a couple drops of glycerin which both work wonderfully with it. All that said, it isn't the softest badger brush around, comparing it to one I bought for my father a few years back (although that one cost over 3 times as much) and it is pretty small too, so don't expect miracles out of it. For the price, it's tough to beat and so far seems pretty well made although it has lost a hair here and there. Not really a big deal to me. It holds a good amount of water within the hair after soaking in a hot bowl full for making a great warm lather after a shake or two."
2,Very Disappointing,"We have two pairs of Tweezerman tweezer's in our household, and they are very well-crafted. Durable, precise, and comfortable to use. So I took a chance thinking the same attention to detail would carry over to this shaving brush. Alas, that is not the case. First, the brush I received is not the brush pictured. Mine came with a shiny chrome handle (?) -- though upon reading some of the one-star reviews describing the wood cracking after only a short period, maybe that is a blessing. The bristles also started falling out with the first use. And continued with the second. I haven't yet used it a third time.All that said, it is cheap for a shaving brush. For that reason alone, I will not go through the hassle of returning it, and instead will use it until it completely falls apart, then go back to [...]and get a real shaving brush. I am being generous with two stars for the low price."
4,Great for the price.,"I have to admit that I don't have much brush experience. I've had two brushes. A synthetic one, and this one.This one feel much better than the synthetic. Although the ends are much 'pokier.' It doesn't feel so pleasant if you brush it a little bit wrong. The ends really jab into you.Some bristles fell out at first. But not many if any at all now. Nice wood base. Works great for the price."
3,"The Brush works, the wooden base works, but not together","I recently converted over from using everything from the generic foams or gels to using shaving soap and a badger brush. Although I can tell you that this method of shaving is far superior; I would stay away from this particular brush.The set of bristles came off of the wooden base on the first shave. This happened as I was trying to squeeze the soap out of the brush (picture squeezing a tube of toothpaste) on my second pass of shaving. If you do end up buying this product, just hold on to the base of the bristles when you do this and you may be fine. However glue is what holds the bunch of bristles together on the wooden base where I would have preferred more of a mechanical attachment (such as a metal ring with teeth) in addition to the glue. -Rene N."
2,Get what you pay for,"This brush is only $10, so you get what you paid for. It smells really bad when you first get it. It will go away after a while. The bristles fall out easily. It doesn't lather very well at all. I would highly recommend against this brush and just stick to getting a silver tip badger brush. Don't waste your time with the low quality unless you have fine hair, then it may be ok. But with someone like me having a think beard, i need a good lather. This just doesn't cut it."
2,Painful,"This is a pretty good price for a brush, but I wouldn't recommend it. The bristles did not feel so great on my face, they were actually fairly painful rubbing on my face. The brush must have lost about 10 bristles the first time I used it. While this one is on its way back to amazon I may try another."
1,poor craftmenship,"loved the brush for the first month i had it, then it fell apart. the brush fibers came unglued from the handle."
1,Waste of money,"I had a badger brush from the local big box store, thought this one looked a little better. I was really dissapointed. Doesn't look much like the nice rounded brush in the picture, more like one that got a bad haircut. It was jagged, much smaller brush in proportion to the handle. And the darn thing is uncomfortable to use - a green scrubby from the kitchen is softer. It is probably the last Tweezerman's product I will try."
2,Shave brush,This is an ok shave brush. It is very rough for a badger haired brush and feels no different than a boar hair brush. I think it probably is a boar hair with just a couple of badger hairs. Company's can legally do that as long as they use 3 percent of what they are claiming it to be and that goes for everything even food products! It feels like an old school straw broom on your face. I dropped the brush and it broke where the bristles meet the handle so the sturdiness is somewhat questionable but for 10 bucks what can you expect? I just bought the Van Der Hagen's kit for men and it should be here tomorrow (1/11/13). I just opened the Van Der Hagen kit I ordered and the brush is SO soft compared to the Tweezerman's. I cant even describe how soft this brush really is. I would never buy another Tweezerman's brush EVER. Spend the extra 20 bucks and get the Van Der Hagen's Luxury Shave Kit. Take it from someone who has VERY sensitive facial skin. You will not regret it!!!
4,Decent shaving brush,"I've used this for around 6 months now and I am pleased with it. Its priced low for a quality badger brush. It has the funky smell when you get it (they all do) and it eventually goes away. The only complaint I have is that it sheds at least a couple hairs each time I use it...I dont know if its normal or not, and i do store it bristles down. Great product for price."
4,Very nice brush,"I had started out wet shaving with a brush from an Art of Shaving gift set. I wanted to upgrade from that brush, and I'm glad that I did. The Tweezerman is a large, thick brush, and the bristles are nice and sturdy. My only complaint would be that one or two hairs comes out each time I shave, even after about two months of use. It's not noticeable in the integrity of the brush, so I'd say this is a great purchase for the price."
1,Sheds like crazy,"I've only used this brush about 3 times, but every time, it sheds quite a bit. One redeeming quality about this brush is that the hair it covers my face in is actually badger hair, I looked but didn't see mention of this in the product description. I am new to wet shaving, so I really don't know if it is normal for brushes like this one to shed, or at least for them to shed so much. More often than not, it really is true that you get what you pay for. I wouldn't reccomend this brush unless you just really need the cheapest one possible, that really is what this one is."
1,smells absolutely awful when wet,"soon as water hits this brush it literally makes your entire bathroom smell like 50 soaking wet dogs. it's so bad it honestly smells borderline feces like, used once, threw into trash, and proceeded to spray air fresheners and run fans in my bathroom AND connecting bedroom."
5,Love this!,"Only used it a couple times, but I am absolutely LOVING this brush. It holds the perfect amount of water to make great lathers. It's much softer than my boar brush and feels great on the skin. I HIGHLY recommend this anyone!"
3,"Its good, but then.. i had to work on it","I was a little upset to say that...i pulled it out the package in 2 pieces. Not enough glue on the brush to keep to the handle. It was quite an upset to be honest. But once I krazy glued it in, let it sit it was good to go! Also, one more thing, CLEAN OUT THE BRUSH. oxyclean. let it sit in soap. ANYTHING. it wreaks of fresh badger! lol"
4,Great economical brush,"For the price range, this is a great brush. It appears that others have had issues with the hairs falling out. I haven't had any of those problems, and I've been using it daily for several weeks now. It would shed occasionally in the first few uses, but after about 5 shaves it stopped shedding. My only reason I gave 4 stars is that it is not THAT comfortable of a brush, compared to others that I have used. But for the price, it is still a great deal for the wet shaver on a budget."
2,Loses hair,"I read the reviews about this brush and was hesitant to buy it because it's so cheap. Several of the other reviews talked about how it loses hair. I saw a few reply to those saying that if you take proper care of it then it won't. Well, I assure you it still does. It started losing hair the first time I used it and has continued several shaves later. I won't be buying this again. I guess you really do get what you pay for."
1,Waste of Money !!,"DO NOT BUY !!! This is just waste of money, first time use and brush is falling in part, black color is coming from the brush, it not deserve the single star."
2,Poor quality?,"I followed the ""experts"" advice but this brush continues to lose bristles from shave one. I just started ""real shaving"" after years of cartridges and $$$ and canned foam. Despite extra care while whipping up lather, I found my soap, my mug, and my ""mug"" covered in badger bristles. Tried gently rinsing the brush, light shaking it, and being very gentle but still ended up covered in bristles. After using the brush and following the expert's advice on rinsing and shaking, and hanging it up to dry, handle end up, the brush now looks like a rounded shrub, with stray bristles sticking out the sides at odd angles. Despite the brush, though, I had a very enjoyable experience shaving with my new DE razor, getting a nice, smooth, close shave. My better half noticed the difference immediately! I am hooked! Now, on to find a good quality brush for my next shave....and I never ever thought I would look forward to shaving!"
2,Sheds more than my dog.,Is that my hair in the drain or from the brush? I think most of it is from the brush.
2,Hold more water,"I got this product as a temporary fix for my boyfriend and sadly it was not even that. He said it doesn't hold water like a good wet shaving brush should and the handle is very small. It is only $11 lost, but still kinda sad. Oh well, I tried."
2,Quality not what expected,Rec'd be4 quoted date. Quality of brush is not what I expected for the price I paid. Looking for a better brush.
2,Horrible shaving brush,"Please note that this is my first time using a shaving brush as I just got into the whole old school way of shaving. My experience with this brush was that as soon as I first used it the hairs on the brush came off and on to my face. I am assuming this should not be happening. For $15, I guess it did the job."
2,Lather Hog!,"My first brush and I cannot recommend it. It builds a good lather, but won't release soap to your face. The more I used the brush the more lather it REMOVED from my face. Thoroughly disappointed! And as a previous reviewer noted... yes it stinks!"
1,I should've researched before buying,"This brush came up first in the search and is popular because it is inexpensive and works well enough, so it's the one I bought. I gave it one star not because of the brush itself, but because of treatment of badgers in China to get this hair. Had I researched first, I would never have bought any badger brush, I would have bought synthetic. I won't say what I learned, because I don't want my review to be offensive. I'll just say that if you're an animal friendly person, you may want to spend five minutes researching the source of badger hair before choosing to support this process with your purchase. I wish I had."
2,DON'T TRUST REVIEWS ON THIS ONE,"APPERANTLY I HAVEN'T DONE MY RESEARCH RIGH, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GOOD BRUSH FOR ABOUT A MONTH OR SO,SINCE THIS IS MY FIRST BRUSH AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GET AN EXPENSIVE ONE AT THIS STAGE. THE PRICE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, LOOSES HAIR RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, AND WHEN SHAVING IT LEAVES HAIR ON YOUR FACE, IT ALSO STUNCK LIKE A RUBBER OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THATS HOW IT SHOULD BE FIRST- SECOND USE (BUT I DOUBT IT). SO I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GO WITH A HIGHET QUALITY BRUSH."
2,Sheds Bristles Consistently,"Even with a shaving brush stand and gentle use (both in the cup and on my face), this brush has lost bristles every time I've used it. I will be returning it. I get a better shave using the regular shaving cream, hand-applied, that I was using."
5,A dab of avocado TOBS on it and it's on!,"Don't know how this stacks up against other badger brushes, as this is my first , but this beauty is a gem! Decided to get another brush rather abruptly after the middle bristles on my Boar Bristle fell out. Talk about a harbinger... Panicking, I searched the internet for reviews on brushes, trying to balance cost with function. This brush seemed to be the best value, as several other reviewers attested. It looked alittle small in the pictures and I was relieved when I got it that it was just right. Dries out almost immediately after a light shake while suspended in it's holder. I am happy I purchased this one!"
2,Pretty Cheap,"This thing lost quite a few hairs initially, and then the entire brush head just fell off the handle. I only used it about 10 times."
1,Major Hair Loss,So I read all (most of) the reviews on this brush and went ahead and bought one. I also read at least 15 articles on the proper use of the brush. I shaved with using the brush to lather up on 4 occasions and each time I was busy picking hairs off my face and razor. It dropped at least 10-12 hairs per shave. This made the whole shaving experience a big hassle and not nearly as enjoyable as I'd hoped for. I will be getting a higher quality brush tomorrow and try again. I don't recommend this brush to anyone.
2,Not a stiff bristle,Not a stiff enough brush for my taste. The bristle flattens out as soon as you start working in the lather and end up working the soap in with the stump of the handle.
2,Tweezerman badger brush,"No great disappointment, just a nice brush for a very good price. I've used it twice since buying and a few bristles have shed, as to be expected, but on the whole... not too bad considering. The handle is fairly well finished with no areas untouched by the protective coating. The natural bristles do have a fairly distinct odour, but I'm sure this will pass with continued use.... I hope so anyway.EDIT: 21st Aug.That natural bristle odour, from the brush I spoke of, has dissipated quickly. A few more hairs have shed/broken but have been slight. For it's cost and performance, I recommend that you buy this one. I really should've bought two."
2,Tweezerman should stick to tweezers,"Lost about 2 dozen bristles on the first shave and I found the brush extremely hard. I only used this once and went back to my Van Der Hagen that I bought as part of a $7 shave kit at Walmart. Shown here:Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)Soap in Van Der Hagen kit is great as well. Bowl is small but gets the job done."
2,You get wat you pay for,I bought this on the recommendation of other reviewers. I have to say I am really disappointed. I have been using the brush for two weeks solid and it leaves hairs/bristles on my face every time. It isn't how I am storing or using this brush that is causing this either. I have a proper stand and clean it after each use. I have been shaving old school for years now and am no novice. Save your money and buy a better quality brush.
2,"Not so great, really.","I bought this brush when I first began DE shaving about 6 months ago and used it for the first 3.5 months. I never had any problems with the handle. It's still fine. There was some moderate shedding at the beginning, which is to be expected. Lathers up ok. Water retention isn't bad either.The thing I don't like is that it's too scratchy, even after having broken in, which didn't take long (a few uses). It's not horribly scratchy, but it is enough to where I never use it anymore now that I have a couple of brushes that are better quality (and more expensive - Semogue 1305 boar and Parker Silvertip badger). Granted, the Tweezerman's a cheap badger brush, and if you just have NO money, I suppose it's ok... maybe. I wouldn't recommend it, though. It might be kind of difficult to get better quality than this at its low price, but I think spending a little more on a better brush, even for a beginner, is definitely the way to go."
1,Horrible,After reading all these awesome reviews of this Brush I decided to buy it. It is hands down the worst purchase I made on Amazon. This Brush absolutely STINKS! Not only that it doesn't lather properly it has a foul smell that you cannot get rid of. I used it for 3 weeks and tried every trick in the book to get rid of the smell but nothing helped. I ended up throwing it away. My Omega brush that I picked up in a convenience store for $8 bucks does a way better job.I would not recommend this brush to anyone.
2,Poor Quality Brush,"Based on the price, I have to admit that I was not expecting a premium quality brush . But I was surprised when the brush head came loose from the handle and fell to the floor the third time I used it. I re-attached it with epoxy, but I am not sure that this brush is going to last very long. Currently looking for a higher quality brush."
1,please dont waste your money,"It is the worst shaving brush i ever used.The bristle are so hard and rough, definitely not meant for you face,may be for polishing the shoes.I tried twice with different shave gel but results are the same.You dont want to use it unless you are punishing yourself."
5,badger brush,I had to purchase a second one of these to use at work. Can't beat this brush for the low price!
1,Terrible brush,"This is a terrible brush. It's lost so many hairs. When used with a soap puck, hairs are left over on the puck. It also has a terrible smell and is prickly on the face."
2,I know this is an animal product but...,"Man does this brush smell awful. It smells like unwashed animal. Like a pen at an animal recovery center. It works okay I guess, but a lot of bristles have come out, which Im sure will stop eventually, but the stink of this brush is VERY disappointing. I've been spraying cologne on it in hopes that the stench will fade.A friend of mine has one from Art of Shaving, and his doesn't reek."
2,Sheds so much that it impedes shaving,"Upon using it for the first time, the brush shed like crazy. I had to use my nails to try to pick out the badger hairs so that I could shave. It made it a lengthy and annoying process. I wish I had purchased this locally rather than on Amazon; I would have headed straight back to the store to return it. (It's not worth returning it now because I'd only get 50% back.) I have kabuki and powder makeup brushes that work better than this. I've only used it once, but I'm not looking forward to my next attempt."
3,Good brush for someone new to wet shaving,"This brush is a great value. It is a little stiff at first,but will soften up over time.I have used this with soaps and creams no problem.There are better brushes out there and i still use this for travel.For the money, this is hard to beat."
3,Tweezerman Shaving Bush,"for my first foray into traditional DE wetshaving, i purchased this brush, along with a Merkur Classic #178 and some Col. Conk soap as recommended by a list of shaving products here on amazon. I dont have any experience with another brush against which to compare, but this brush has worked very well for me in the week or so i have been using it. it looks smaller to other brushes i have seen in video reviews, but none the less it creates a nice smooth lather once you get the motion down. my only complaint is that every time i use it it leaves just one bristle on my face, in the bowl, or stuck to the soap. this is no big deal, and is hardly a reason to consider a brush 2 or 3 times the cost of this one.This brush is a great value since it costs far less than any others on Amazon and does what it promises. that being said, i will buy a nicer one in the future, which is what im sure most of the people who buy this do."
3,okay brush,"I bought this brush because it was inexpensive and it was made from real badger hair. When I got it, it had a particular smell on it that has not quite gone away. It lingers around, and contaminates my shaving soap. It is also a bit short, I would prefer a longer brush. Although it is made from badger hair, it is a bit coarse. Not quite as soft as I hoped for. However, for the money, it is a decent brush. If it were a little longer, I don't think I would have minded all the other imperfections."
5,Good Product,"Brush is a little better than expected. It is not equal to a $200 brush, but it cost much less. Better than boar hair."
2,Disappointing,"I was satisfied with the brush until the bristles separated from the base after only 4 uses. I had to reglue the two pieces. Needless to say, I can't call that a good experience and would not buy this product in the future.Update: So, after regluing the brush, it lasted a couple more weeks until it came apart again. Its a shame the construction is so poor because its an otherwise nice brush. I have ordered a Kingsley brush and can only hope I have better luck."
4,First Shaving Brush - Impressed!,"I just converted to a double edge razor from the Gilette Fusion...I was getting tired of spending close to $30 for refill cartridges to refill! Anyways, the brush is a brush - it shed a little bit, but from what I read that is to be expected. It did a great job developing a lather and felt good on my face. The only negative I would say, and I've seen it in other reviews, is take the time to shampoo the brush before you use it. The brush has a funky odor, it's not terrible - but it's not exactly something you want around your nose for an extended period of time. Besides that, this product does what you need it to do without spending too much!"
4,So far its great!,"This brush is very nice for the price. Some hairs fall out of the brush the first time it is used, but they fall out less and less the more it is used. This brush has done a great job at solving my problem with razor burn. It really makes the hairs raise to the surface for a clean shave. The brush dose have kind of a weird odor about it, but I am guessing it will fade with use."
4,S-c-r-a-t-c-h-y brush,"From what I've read, some people love a scratchy brush while others favor a soft one. The Tweezerman's the first kind.Contrary to another review I read here, the brush I received had no smell of any kind. I soaked it, lathered up, and although in the end I preferred a softer brush I was pretty happy with this one.This was the first shaving brush I used, the soft one was the second, and so far there hasn't been a third - so I'm far from an expert. But if your skin craves scratchiness, this may be the shaving brush for you!"
3,OK for the price,"I just started shaving with a brush and haven't really liked it too much. I started with a small brush from Art of Shaving in their trial package and it was good, but small. this Tweezerman is full sized Badger hair and seemed nice. But as soon as i started whisking it some of the hairs started falling out, I was not expecting that. Other than that, it gets a nice lather and works like it should."
3,"Love the brush,....while it lasted !","I've used this brush and enjoyed it for about 6-8 months.I hang it brush side down,....always!Yesterday while rinsing & drying it, I tapped it on the edge of the sink,and the brush knot feel out.I've tried rubber cement. NOT.Anyone know what type of glue to use to re-glue the bristles to the handle?Other than that small/lrg/ problem, I really like this little brush."
3,Good way to get into shaving with a brush,"I got this brush because I wanted to try shaving with a brush and soap for the first time. This was an inexpensive brush but was still well recommended by a professional. The badger brush head is good quality and feels nice on the skin. The bristles created a nice lather and this allowed me to get a really nice clean shave. I lost a few bristles the first time I used it, but I figure all the loose ones will have fallen out after a few shaves. I would recommend this brush for novices that want an inexpensive way to get into a new type of shaving.UPDATE: I have been using the brush for only about 2 months now and I have noticed a lot of bristles are falling out. Also the outer edge of bristles is getting bent and mussed up."
1,Regret Never Balded So Fast,"Don't believe the BS- I did and bought a brush who's hair started falling out on the first shave. I let it dry bristles down on a brush stand after every use, I apply gentle pressure when lathering up the soap, and yet it still sheds hair like my overweight cat.Crap purchase."
5,First Class Shaving Brush,Had a boar hair shaving brush. Read the reviews about a Badger hair brush.The price was good. Reviews were good. Ordered it and am very satisfied.It is superior to the boar hair shaving brush I had been using.
5,Excellent value,"For the money, you cant buy a better shaving brush.The brush is on the small size, and the handle is small. I wish it was a bit larger. But its a very good brush and has done all I have asked. No problem with shedding and reasonably soft. I like a stiffer brusn to scrub with and like using this brush. I am glad I bought it and would recommend it to others."
5,Awesome Brush Gets The Job Done,There's no reason to spend more for a badger brush. I'm very happy with this purchase and would buy the brush again. I'm been using it eveyday and see no issues. The only thing you need to remember is to wipe down the wooden handle when you're done.
5,B+ product for A+ price,The thing was cheap and it works well. Some of the brissles are a bit frizzled but it still works well after four months of use.
3,"Good little brush, but there are better for the money","It's a very good badger brush for the price, and I don't think a buyer would be disappointed with it. It lathers well, and seems durable.However, the pure badger hair used on this brush is a little prickly, which becomes an annoyance after a while. The handle is quite small, so if you enjoy bowl lathering, prepare for things to get a little messy.As an alternative, I would recommend an Omega boar brush, for less money. My Omega Pro 49- about $15 on Amazon- was softer than the Tweezerman from day one, and is only getting better, as the ends of boar bristles split with use, making the brush softer. Well broken in boar brushes become incredibly soft, and still have lots of backbone for face lathering.White Handled Omega Professional Boar Hair Shaving BrushMaybe some day I'll get a really nice silvertip badger brush. Until then, the little Tweezerman will still be used occasionally, just not as often as the Omegas."
5,works great for me,"I've been using this brush for 4 or 5 years. After 20 years of a bristle brush, this is luxury. The brush is full and soft and I only occasionally notice a lost hair in the shaving mug. The only issue I had was that when I first used the brush, the badger musk nearly knocked me over. Two weeks of use washed all of the scent (except for my shaving soap) out."
4,Shaving brush,"I bought this as a present, but it seems like a great brush at a great price (most are much more expensive). Also, the delivery was fast."
5,the best,"I have been wet shaving for most of my 39 years and this is the best brush I have ever owned. the bristles stay in the handles and do not fall out during use. make a rich lather with the mug soap, and after a couple months of good use the handle is in like new shape. to maintain any brush you must hang it up with the bristles facing downUPDATE: have been using this brush since Sept 09. it still looks new. I make sure to hang it up after every use brush down. i also rinse it after every use. I think i have to will this to my daughters husband. By the way she is 10 years old right now."
5,Hard to beat for the money!,"For the price I paid I couldn't be more pleased with this brush. For only a few bucks more than a synthetic or some other kind of animal hair you can get a badger brush which best for building a good shaving lather. The fist 5 or 6 times I used it I did loose a few hairs but haven't since, also this one like most badger brushes did have a certain musky animal smell to it. I didn't find it over whelming but did try to get rid of it using shampoos and hand soaps, I read online some folks soak it in Borax but I worried it might damage the hairs. After the 6th use or so the smell was gone so I guess just using it more often might be best. I also wanted to get a stand for it so it would drip dry and prevent bacteria but didn't want to spend more on that than I did for the brush so I made one out of a coat hanger. It's ghetto but it works! This brush isn't the biggest but it gets the job done just fine. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another for myself or as a gift!"
4,Great Brush!,"I bought this brush for my husband for Christmas. He has been using brushes for years. The first time or two that he used it, some of the bristles came out. We thought we'd bought a bad brush. After that, the bristles stopped falling out. He now loves the brush and wanted me to write this review to let other potential buyers know. When it's time to replace this one, we'll buy another one just like it."
3,Does the job!,"Nice little badger shave brush, does the job. Light shedding. Too bad it smells like a wet badger- (hoping that aroma eventually goes away)If this is what a wet badger really smells like, I can personally guarantee that there are no wet badgers within a 100-mile radius of my home. I'd smell 'em."
2,Great until Hair knot falls out!,"I purchased this shaving brush in June 2011. It worked great for 3 months. One day I was preparing to shave, and as I wet it under hot tap water, the hair knot just fell out of the handle! I didn't soak the shaving brush (it actually floats anyway); I always rinsed it out with hot water then cold water, and hung it in a shaving brush stand (bristles down) to air dry. I'm going to contact the seller to try to get a replacement."
1,Terrible quality,I bought this as a travel brush for my trip to England so I wouldn't risk losing my expensive badger brush. I used it a total of 4 times. 3 times before I left to break it in and 1 time at the hotel. The entire knot fell out in my hand during the fourth shave. Extremely irritated and disappointed. I didn't expect the best brush ever but I expected to get more then 4 shaves out of it.
5,A good value,"This is a good, quality brush at a reasonable price. I can't imagine how much better one costing twice as much or more could add to my shaving. Given how this one is doing -- about 10 months into it and going strong -- I doubt I'll bother trying anything else. It sheds a bristle every now and then, or I'd give it 5-starts.Well, it's still going strong 8/2012. I'm bumping it to 5 stars."
1,Affordable and disposable,"My experience with this brush has been terrible. Well, the first two or three days were wonderful. By the third day, the brush was shedding bristles like mad into my razor. By the second week, the wooden handle (which does look durable) cracked and the plastic sleeve that holds the bristles popped out--never to go back in again. I am replacing this brush, sadly, after about 15 uses, and I will be purchasing a more expensive brush, I hope with better results.***Update, a few months later: I didn't replace the brush. I super-glued the bristle-sleeve back into the wooden handle. It eventually stopped shedding bristles, and I have used it successfully since then. The wooden handle still looks like it will deteriorate quickly as the finish continues to chip off. Still not recommended, since I don't think I should have to repair a product within the first few weeks of use."
1,Bad little badger,"No self-respecting badger would accept hairs like this. Tweezerman must have plucked them out of the back end of a camel. No, no cigar for this product flop. Pay a little extra and get a decent brush."
1,Smells terrible,I'm buying something else because this brush literally stinks and my bathroom reeks like ferret. I've been using it for about a week hoping the soap makes the odor go away. I'm done and it's gone.
2,Nice brush at a good price,"I bought this brush because I wanted to see what the deal was with badger brushes. I used it for a little while and liked it but I will stick with my boar brush.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad little brush for the price, I just prefer a boar brush because I find them more comfortable. Badger hair is way too soft and it feels more like a mop and less like a brush.All in all I'd say badger brushes are over rated. I'd recommend this product if you want to see what badger brushes are all about but don't want to spend a fortune on a fancy one or if you already like badger brushes but want a cheap one for traveling."
3,don't knock it on the side of your sink... the brush will fall apart,Great brush. I've had it for a few months. Just be careful when trying to shake the excess water out of it: I hit mine against the sink (really did a good job of shaking the water out) but the bristle-head popped out of the wooden base and I can't get it back in there.
2,Fell apart after ~2 months,"After ~2 months of daily use, the brush detached from the handle and could not be reattached. The brush was great before falling apart, however..."
4,great brush,Great brush for the correct application i.e. mixing the shave cream. Use your more expensive silvertip to apply cream/soap to your face. Clean the tweezerman with hair shampoo and conditioner and rinse. Leave the brush outside in the fresh air for a few days. The badger odor will go away. Great travel brush as well. Even the pros seem to have 1 tweezerman in their collection.
4,Way better than my boar's hair brush.,I just started wet shaving with brushes and lathers. I started off with a boar's hair brush because it was really cheap. But it didn't produce much lather with the Proraso i had bought.This badger hair brush is way better. Holds water better. Produces way more lather. Dries well.I did notice that it did have a smell. Not too powerful though. I'm sure it'll go away after a few shaves and washes. My first shave about 6 hairs fell out. I hope this isn't going to be a problem though.I'm really hoping this brush lasts.
2,poor quality!,"when i got this brush, i thought this is a good quality brush!but i was wrong!the first time i tried, already started to falling out.however, its very soft and fine to use but, still not good quality!"
1,Cracked me up,"This brush was defective out of the box. The wood handle is cracked. This would allow water to leak inside where the bristles are joined to the handle and lead to all the bristles falling out. I guess I got one of the bad ones. Although this brush received good reviews, invest $15 or $20 more and buy a better quality brush. I got what I paid for."
4,Best bargain shaving brush!,"I went looking for good quality shaving brushes, but couldn't afford a high price tag. After much searching, review checking, etc I purchased the Tweezerman. It is not the softest, but not the coarsest. It lathers up soap into a lovely froth. The hairs handle the abuse well and doesnt fall apart. The handle is wood.If you're looking for a bargain shaving brush to use with double edged razors then look no further."
2,Lots of hair loss and very scratchy,The brush lost quite a few hairs every shave using it daily for 2 weeks. Brush was also very scratchy. Have since bought a different brush.
2,Fell apart easily,"Bristles fell out easily, the entire top came unglued from wooden base. Better off just going to a chain store."
1,made at the broom factory,This is a shaving brush? on my face it feels like the stiff broom I use to sweep my garage floor-I have wire brushes for stripping paint that would be easier on my skin-I have used shaving brushes for years and am totally shocked at how bad this product is.
2,Glued in hair broke off several months later.,"Length:: 0:01 MinsYou get what you pay for. Brush was fine until the fur totally separated from the handle. Only owned the brush for a few months. Time to upgrade. (As a side note, it wasn't as soft as better quality brushes I've seen.)"
3,Still shedding bristles after 3 months,"I think I am treating it well--drying bristles down, holding the base of the bristles to protect the knot, not overloading with water, etc.-- but the thing just keeps shedding. I know it's not a particularly high quality brush, and it does get the job done, I just don't like picking hairs off my cheeks every third day."
4,Works great,"Like this a lot. I have had a few of whiskers fall out, but nothing major. Overall it is holding up very well. Especially for the price."
1,Horrible,"This brush was painful to use, had some bristles that felt and looked like long wood splinters. I painstakingly cut out the bad bristles, but it still wasn't as good as The Body Shop synthetic bristle brush. So I threw it out. Guess I need to spend more $."
4,"A good starter, and a decent bargain.","An all around good brush. I find that it holds water well, has a decent knot size, and builds a nice lather. It sheds here and there, but nothing I would describe as excessive. It's the perfect brush for someone who wants to try out wetshaving but doesn't want to drop a ton of money on their first kit."
1,Handle separated from brush twice!,"I really wanted to love this brush, and I tried! The brush head itself is very nice. Builds up nice lather and holds heat well, unlike the Van Der Hagen boar brush I have. Can't say the same for the build though. Had this for about two weeks and the handle came apart from the brush head. Got a replacement from Amazon and the same thing happened to the replacement. I use a stand to store it upside down after using it too, although I do soak it in hot water to soften up while I'm showering, as recommended by the wet shaving community. Gonna try using some supper glue to keep it on this time and eliminate the soak step. Hopefully that will work! But I shouldn't have to do that!"
2,It's Like a Cheap Paintbrush,"I know that this is on the lower end of the badger-hair brushes and that some of the other reviews of the brush have been great, but I wasn't impressed at all. The brush shed at least 20 hairs, if not more, the first time I used it. Since then the amount has gone down with each shaving, but it is at about 2-3 per shaving. It's like a cheap paintbrush that is constantly losing its bristles, which end up on the soap cake or plastered to the side of my face. It's possible I just received the one bad brush out of the batch, but I will be looking for a better brush very soon."
5,Worth the price,"I was not looking for something exceptional, but got a great brush for the price. I have used it only once upon arrival, but I am satisfied that it was worth it."
5,Greatttt,Forget getting those brush's at the big box stores.Tweezerman is the real deal. Parts of the brush do not come out as you use it.It's great.
1,AWFUL!!!,"I didnt expect much from such a cheap brush, but it still managed to let me down. Not only did it give off a horrible chemical smell, but whatever they polish/varnish the handle with dripped off immediately after my first use, leaving my white counter a dirty muddy shade."
1,Broke after a single use,"I purchased this brush after reading the reviews. This is my first brush as I've only recently needed one. I only was able to successfully use it once. I read up on how to take of these brushes properly and made sure to do so. A few hairs came loose during the first use, but nothing too bad. The second time I used this, after a couple strokes of whipping up the lather, the brush separated from the handle. I'm attempting to salvage by super-gluing the brush back to the handle, but I'm not optimistic."
2,It sheds,"It is true you get what you pay for! I've used this brush for well over a week and it sheds at least two to three hairs each use. It looses them in the bowl and on my face. At this rate, I will have to buy another in several months."
1,Never even got it out of the box!,I just opened the shipping box which seemed to be in good condition and found ALL of the bristles to be detached from the handle. The brush is inside a clear plastic box that is unopened and all of the bristles have come loose from what looks like a very poorly executed glue job. I have since noticed many other folks who have had a similar situation. Looks like I will have to spend more.
4,shaving brush,"Nice quality brush for shaving soap lather. Combined with the shaving bowl, col. conks famous shaving soap and the safety razor it put my spouse in perfect shape for a good shave."
3,Looked promising...got a lemon,"Decided to purchase a Tweezerman's shaving brush based of other customers experiences. Looked like a good product when it arrived; however, I noticed immediately after the first use it was shedding hairs like crazy. Ended up returning it and buying one from Target since I needed it right then.I may buy one in the future when I need a new one as I suspect I got a lemon."
4,GREAT for the money.,"After searching for a badger brush to enter my safety-razor-shaving switchover, I decided to give this one a try, solely because it's a badger brush, yet a fraction of the price of other shaving brushes. In fact, I passed over this brush several times BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, thinking that it COULDN'T POSSIBLY be a badger brush for that price... and yet, it seems to be, as far as I can tell, based on my lather and wear so far. I finally ordered it figuring ""what have I got to lose for the price?""-- and I'm glad I did.As others have mentioned, I've also had an issue with a few bristles falling out during my first few shaves. They work their way out of the cluster and get washed away during my rinse. Honestly, I can't even tell they're gone-- the brush has only gotten better for me the more I use it. Granted, it may not be the ELITE silver-tipped badger hair, but heck, it works great for my needs."
2,During first use bristles falling out,"Like some of the other reviews for this product, I have to give this brush low marks. I used it for the first time this morning with Proraso shave cream. I immediately noticed bristles being left behind in the container. Following the packaging instructions I dried the brush hanging upside down. At the end of the day I noticed that more bristles are ready to fall out. For the price I guess it makes a good first brush if you're just getting into 'old school' shaving. But still not happy."
2,It sheds,"I have had this brush for about two months.I read the reviews but thought if i did as the instructions read, that it should last. I was wrong. I washed the brush to get the loose hair out, dry it and lay it on its side as instructions suggest.Even after 2 months it is loosing the hair bristles. Every use three or more hairs fall out. I am going to buy another one , but not this brand."
3,works well,does its job well. lifts the beard up and produces a nice shave. it loses a hair or two with every shave even though i treat it as a shave brush should be. it not much of a complaint
4,Great Brush,For the price a great brush....have more expensive brushes but tend to go back to this one due to handling and ease.
2,Stinks. Literally.,"This is an all badger brush, and believe me, it smells like it. You get what you pay for. I've previously used a Vulfix brush which costs a couples times more than this, but was well worth it. This brush is barely useable, the hairs are extremely prickly unlike higher quality brushes, and it smells like a dead badger!"
3,"Pretty good, for a Beginer","The Tweezerman Shave brush is brush that Works well for 'Face-Lathering'. It does not hold enough lather or water to bowl lather for me. Very prickly at first then eventually breaks in and softens up. Just remember, this brush is Small. Smaller than you think it is. If you're beginning, you can buy this brush, I wouldn't bash you for it, but Please spend a couple extra bucks and buy a Vulfix Super Badger brush, I would take ONE Vulfix over a free lifetime of Tweezermans (and believe me, you would to!)"
2,You get what you pay for,I've joined the ranks of guys with badger bristles falling out. They get all over the soap and all over my face. They clog up the razor. I would not purchase this a second time.
2,Wore out fast,"I used this brush for about 6 months. Over that time, it continually lost bristles and then today, all of the bristles broke away from the wood handle."
1,"Bristles fall out, unglue from handle","From the beginning I used this brush, bristles continually fell out. After about 2 months of use, the bristles unglued from the handle. This item is very cheaply constructed.I received a brush as a gift from Crabtree and Evelyn, and it has not disappointed. I have had it now for almost a year -- no bristles fall out, and the bristles are well connected to the handle."
2,Ummmm,Good for the price. I bought it and the head of the brush didn't hold. I had to buy super glue to attach it.
2,The price is right,"You get what you pay for, the price is right, the brush is stored in brush hanger but it still starts falling apart after a couple of uses."
3,Shed like crazy for a while,"The first several times that I used this brush hairs came off it at a worrisome rate. This was both annoying and troublesome, but after about a month of use the problem is gone and I can't really tell that anything is missing. I suppose this is par for the course for a badger hair brush at this price point, but that does not make it any less unpleasant to pick stray badger hairs off your face and out of the sink.That said, the brush does what it's meant to do, is pleasant to use now that it no longer sheds, and it allows me to use half the shaving cream I needed to use before."
4,Good Brush,"Great brush for a beginner. Makes very rich and thick lather. Only downside is the wooden handle. The protective coating on the wood started to peel off from the top at the very beginning. It's also developed a small crack. Other than that, great brush!"
5,"3 weeks, no problems","I've been using this brush since I converted to wet shaving 3 weeks ago.A few bristles fell out during the first couple of shaves but nothing since then. Feels nice in the hand and on the face. I create my lather in a mug using Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream and have no problems doing so.My only ""complaint"" is that I think I'd prefer a chrome handle rather than wood, just to look better with my Merkur razor and chrome stand."
2,good but could be better,"*updated* It worked well for a while, but after about 8 months or so the knot fell out. I ended up trying to glue it back in the handle eventually using a healthy blob of silicone seemed to do the trick. I've since traded up for a better brush and passed this one along to my bro who is getting started.Overall it is good to get you started, but I can see many people passing this along like I did. Good luck."
4,Your first shave brush? Start here.,"This brush is a great value. It's one of the least expensive badger-hair brushes you'll find, and it will perform just as well as any of them. If you're looking for your first shave brush, save yourself the disappointment of boar-hair and start with this brush. The handle is a simple natural wood handle, with the unfortunately conspicuous TWEEZERMAN branding. If you ever upgrade to a higher-end brush, you'll be happy to keep this around in your dopp kit for travel."
3,Decent for the money,"I've been using this brush for a year now, and I have to say that you get what you pay for. This is a cheaply made badger brush, but I guess for a starter it makes a good one. I am still losing bristles to this day when I lather soap up. It hasn't really gotten any better, I've just learned that I have to be very gentle and patient with it if I don't want to have hairs fall out of it. Overall I wish I had paid a little more on a brush to begin with, but I also wasn't sure at the time if I would like classic shaving with a safety razor."
4,"Best bang for your buck, and a decent brush at that","Like others have said, this badger hair brush is the best bang for you buck out there.Of all the inexpensive badger brushes, this is the best bang for your buck. If you want better quality, then start looking at the $80 brushes. This $15 brush will perform almost as well, for a fraction of the cost.There are better brushes, to be sure, which is why I don't give it 5 stars. Mine loses the occasional hair, but not often. It is not the softest brush out there either, but still better than boar. If you want better than this, you are going to be spending $80 or more.Bottom line: You are getting a above average brush for bottom of the barrel prices."
1,Cheap,This product is poorly constructed. I was squeezing the water out of it and the brush popped out of the base. Invest in a more expensive brush -- it'll be worth the cost.
1,Broken when it arrived.,"Just opened my package, and the brush had already come unglued from the handle during shipping. What cheap manufacturing! If it falls apart before I even start using it, I don't hold out much hope for long-term endurance. Might have been an ok brush otherwise, but I won't get to find out. I'm returning mine for a refund, and I'll probably order something different next time."
1,Seemed like a good deal,"For the price, seemed like it couldn't be too bad. Worked alright for first shave with it. Handle separated from the bristles as I was building lather for the brush's second use. Read the other reviews, the separation of bristles and handle seems to happen to a significant amount of people."
1,poorly constructed,"The bristles on this brush are all trimmed off bluntly leaving an irritating end on them. It actually hurts the face to use it. Have used boars bristle brushes that were more comfortable on the face. You get what you pay for, I guess."
3,"Still rough, and still shedding hairs","It's very pokey. Sharp hairs. Compared to the pricier ones, it isn't as comfortable to use. Even after a few months. And it still sheds a noticeable amount of hairs while using it."
2,"Decent for the money, but terrible overall","I bought this brush as a travel brush so that I wouldn't risk losing my prized Edwin Jagger silvertip. Let me just say this, spend the extra money and get something better. This thing feels like someone is scratching my face, just absolute terrible. Spend the extra $$$ and buy a decent badger brush. At the minimum by the cheapest offering from a reputable brand like Edwin Jagger. Skip this thing if you'd like to take pride in your shaving experience."
2,Getting what you pay for,"Well, as usual, I got the cheaper item, and ended up with the cheaper quality. There were plenty of glowing reviews, but on the very first use out of the box this thing left so many hairs in my lather bowl and on my face that I had to rinse off a couple of times before I could even shave. Quite disappointed."
3,It works ok,It works as described but every time I shave a few hairs come out. It cleans up well after use. The hairs are soft and it fits comfortably in your hand.
1,You can do so much better,"For the same price you can choose one of several Franks Shaving Badger Brushes, Omega Boar Brushes or The Body Shop Synthetic brush. Any of the alternatives have rave reviews all over the various shaving forums. Although the Tweezerman brush will work, it will also shed constantly and may fall apart. I accidentally ordered two of these and the knot fell out of the handle of the first after a month and both leave badger hair in my soap and on my face. Also, if you read reviews outside of Amazon you'll see that my experience isn't abnormal. It would appear that wet shaving newcomers with nothing to compare it to are responsible for the good reviews Tweezerman has. However once you've experienced a good quality brush the Tweezerman won't be acceptable.TLDR: Why buy something you'll likely replace, just buy a good one once and be done."
1,Bad Smell,"I bought this brush when I first started shaving with double edge razors. I opened up the box, and the smell about knocked me over. I don't know if a Badger is anything like a Skunk, but it sure smells like one. I soaked the brush over night in pure bleach, which helped a bit, but still smelled bad to me. I was all into shaving the old way, but I soon realized that using a good gel shave cream and my hand, is the best way to go. To get the best shave ever, shave with the grain with the gel, then go back and shave with some shave secret in the other direction. I love shaving with a double edge blade, but I tried the soap and brush, and it is not for me. I get a closer shave without it, and less irritation."
2,sharp quills that don't fall out,"This brush is serviceable. I can soap it up and get the soap to my face with it. The quills are noticeably sharp which is a problem with less expensive brushes, but they don't fall out which is another problem with some less expensive ones. I had left my brush of many years behind at a hotel and was in a hurry to get a replacement -- it's the only way I've shaved for many years. Delivery on this one was fast, and I'm still using it. One can never be sure ordering another more expensive one online that it, too, won't have sharp quills *sigh*"
1,Sheds like an old cat.,"I'm very hesitant to leave negative reviews, but this brush, while attractive, is made of very loose hairs that shed without hesitation and leave your lather littered with itchy black hairs. Scrub your face with it (this was the day after I opened it and the second time I used it, period), and you will begin to feel the itchy weight of individual hairs mired in your lather. I shaved quicker than usual just to stop the irritation of the stray hairs. Irredeemably poor work. It sheds like an old cat with a skin disease."
1,pure trash: compared to Art of Shaving product,"I shaved using this product twice. I picked it up to begin a shave, and the brush head fell out on the floor. I bought it because of the overwhelming approval of the product.I would not give it One star..beware unless you are ready to return it.It is a poorly glued cheap product...you get what you pay for...check Art of Shaving for the best shave you will ever have, period!No cuts, no burns, nor errors...Shave brush has 4x the thickness of Badger hair! Amazon delivery is the best; check out the product above there also.You won't be sorry, because you will make an investment not a throw product in process."
2,"Poor quality, to say the least.","It smelled awful even after several washings with shampoo, and it lost about 20 hairs every time I used it. It lathered just fine, I just couldn't stand the smell. For a few dollars more, I decided to purchase an Omega brush, and I expect it to perform much better. If you don't mind the smell and the hair loss, go for it. Not for me though."
2,Worked until it didn't,"I had no problems with this brush for about 2 months. The quality of the hair seemed to be sufficient and provided a great lather. Unfortunately, after 2 months the whole wad of bristles fell out of the base :/Because of this, I can't recommend it. I'll pay the extra couple bucks for a higher quality one I suppose.EDIT: I just received the brush I ordered as a replacement:100% Black Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Blue Wood Handle & Free Stand - From Parker Safety Razor, and it is leagues above my old Tweezerman brush. The bristles are much softer and hold water/lather so much more effectively. The difference is so distinct that I wonder if the Tweezerman brush might actually be boar's hair instead the fair superior badger hair!"
5,Fantastic,"This is a great brush for the price. It smelled a bit like animal, but with a little shampoo, and a couple of uses it wore off. I will buy again."
3,eh.. questionable,worked for a bit; then it fell apart.. the brush from the handle. glued it back together and works well ( assuming it doesnt fall apart again )it works well enough but i have to take off 2 stars for quality .. it shouldn't fall apart after a month of use. i hope this is just a defect not a manufacturing issue
3,Good for the price,Works well with Art of Shaving and other creams. It has suffered from bristle loss though. Still it has a good shape and stiffness to work in the lather.
5,Great,Love it; super soft and looks like it will last for a while. Very good for the price. Would buy again.
3,It works.,Nice brush pretty much. The bristle end came unglued one day in the sink. This was annoying because I thought it was higher quality than that. I guess not. I super glued the bristle bunch back into the handle and have had no other issues with it since. I still use it all the time and it does it's job at making lather on my face. I would still recommend buying it because of the price.
1,SO bad! Don't buy it!,"Honestly, this product is worse than the synthetic counterparties. It does not hold water, so inefficient to do lather.Not comfortable, aggressive in the face. Spend extra and buy something worthy but if you only have $10 you would be better buying cans.I don't understand the positive reviews."
1,Sucks,"Don't buy, this product is terrible. Spend the extra $10 and get a good badger brush. You might not think a brush matters but it definitely does."
4,Such a value! Good quality. Great deal.,"If you are new to wet shaving then this is the first brush you should buy. Shaving enthusiasts can get wrapped up extolling the virtues of triple-digit dollar brushes. It seems a little excessive. I would recommend this for even the experienced shaver. If nothing else, make it your travel brushThe brush is pure badger. It is not too soft - firm enough to create lather and gently exfoliate. However it quickly breaks in to be gentle enough to the paste.At such a value, even if you want to acquire many brushes, this is a worthy addition. For the man contemplating wet shaving, here is a good brush that is not a high risk purchase should you decide safety razor shaving is not for you"
2,Fair brush,"You get what you pay for. If i had to do it all over again i would have spent a few more shekels on a higher quality product. Yes, it does the job but i am constantly picking out hairs from my soap, razor and face. Very annoying. I can only imagine this brush lasting 2 months at most with the amount of hair it loses. Do yourself a favor and steer clear."
1,Stay away,"I hate this brush so much it's not even funny. It loses hairs every time, and it simply isn't worth buying the same item again to risk getting another bad one. Just buy a better quality one, and stay away from this one."
2,Origin of brisle in doubt.,"I have several brushes in my collection including silver tip badger down to a $5.00 boar bristle. As I like to alternate days, I thought thia Tweezerman would be a good middle of the road brush. As it turns out, I find it to be the least comfortable brush I have ever owned. The brissles/hair in the center of the brush actually feel prickly when attempting to lather my face. It appears to be well constructed but sheds heavily. I was very disappointed with this brush overall and could not, in good conscience, recommend it at any price point. Rather than retruning the brush, I will throw it in with my guncleaning gear."
3,don't drop the brush!,"This brush served me very well for several months, until a few days ago. I was shaving, so naturally it was on the sink. The quality of the brush seemed good, so I was very surprised to see the handle pop off from the bristles when it hit the floor. Naturally, I didn't throw it down, and my sink is of average height. Though I tried, there was no way I was getting that handle back together with the bristles. I can't say that I wouldn't recommend this brush, after all, you do get what you pay for...just don't drop it!"
4,Mens Shaving Brush,"Apart from being a bit poky on the skin, its a good brush and gets a good lather. Good value for the price."
3,OK brush,"I have used this brush for a month now. The only bad thing is that it still sheds hairs when I use it, but it isn't noticeable in the thickness of the hairs. Other than that everything is great about this brush especially for the price."
4,Good shaving brush,"The Tweezerman Men's Shaving Brush is a good, lower-cost product. Most shaving brushes available nowadays have a healthy price-tag. In use, the brush produces a nice, even, lather. A good accessory would be a hanger to hang the brush upside down, as recommended by the manufacturer. I've only used the brush a short time, but a few of the badger hairs have already come loose. Nevertheless, it is a good value for the money."
3,No complaints,"I bought this brush as my introduction to old school shaving. Since I was just getting started, I did not want to spend a fortune for a brush. This one fits the bill. Not expensive and does a good job. It does shed a few hairs each use, but it is still new so I don't know if this is a serious problem. Using a brush to apply a good shaving cream is the only way to go. A very enjoyable experience."
4,"Not a top of the line item, but no remorse","It seems a little light and moderate build quality, but it works fine and I've only lost a few hairs now and then. I make sure to rinse it thoroughly and let it dry with the bristles down and I'm confident it will last for awhile. Overall, I like it and don't regret buying it - especially at the price!"
3,tweezerman shaving brush,"i bought this because i was new to the double edge shaving process and really wanted to get the full experience. i also didnt want to pay $75-300 like a lot of the other brushes, you definitely get what you pay for here, the bristles are not nearly as soft or high quality as some of the fancier brushes ive seen in stores, but it gets the job done and is good for beginners."
2,Not great,The brush size is good and I can live with the fact that it stank like a badger out of the package.But the fact that the brush's hair is constantly falling out is rather annoying.
4,tweezerman shaving brush,"I decided to use a brush again after many years without one. Tweezerman fulfilled my needs well. Low cost, durable and comfortable. Recommended."
3,Audit man,"I've used this for about a year. It started out great - holds the right amount of water, creates good lather and is great for face application. About a month ago it started losing a great amount of hair each time I use it. It has gotten so bad that I just ordered a replacement - 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle & Free Stand from Parker Safety Razor. I'm hoping this will last longer and I like the stand/holder."
2,"A good value for the money, although it does shed at first.","EDIT: Okay, after a few more weeks of daily use, the shedding has almost entirely stopped. It lost one bristle this morning, but I had several ""shed free"" days in a row. The brush truly does work very well, a world of difference from the boar brush I previously used. At this price point, I must admit that it's an excellent value. I'd bump this review up a star, if I could.------This brush is reasonably soft, holds water well, and generates great lather. However, each time I use it, 8-10 bristles get deposited on my face! They clog the razor, and I'm constantly picking them off my face and sink. I'd hoped it would be fine after all the loose hairs fell out, but I've been using it daily for two weeks now, and the shedding gets a little worse each day.If something seems unusually inexpensive, it's usually for a reason. I'm shopping for a new brush, and I won't go cheap this time."
1,too good to be true,"this brush has great bristles, comparable to brushes 3 or 4 times the price, but after 6 weeks of use the handle fell off. I thought at that price it seemed to good to be true - and I was right. this is a penny-wise pound-foolish purchase."
4,Great Little Brush,For the money you can't buy a better brush. I own silver tipped badger hair burshes that cost over $125.00 and they are really not that much better than this little brush. It gets the job done and is a very pleasant brush to use. It has a cheap wooden handle but it holds up very well. The bristles are soft and absorbent. What else do you want?
4,Best value I could find at the time.,"Moving from a boar brush to this, the first thing I noticed was the difference in quality of lather. Also, feels better, but not as soft as I thought, on my face. Main thing that is a con, but is expected with all badger brushes(guess what I am about to say..) is the putrid odor. i ran shampoo through it a few times, which it did lessen the power of the putrid aroma. overall, its definetly a nice starter brush and a great value."
2,Shedding?,"It has been about 3 weeks of using this product, and I am still losing about 5 hairs each shave. It has become much, much softer, but I don't know about the shedding- leaves me a little suspect as to the quality of the knot. I have read many reviews on this brush, and some shedding within the first short while is normal, however, this extended period of shedding isn't right...might be just me.The brush was really stinky when it came, however, a cleaning protocol- hot water with Dawn soak for an hour, hot water rinses (30 min each) x3, hot water with vinegar x 30 min, and then 2 iterations of 8 hours sitting in lather worked like a charm. No smell any more (other than Proraso!)"
1,Do not buy.,"I read the reviews. They said this was an excellent brush. They said it wouldn't shed for at least 6 weeks. That would be long enough for me to decide if this type of shaving was for me.I either have a defective product or they're all lying. I'll go with defective, unusual, perhaps. I'm shaving more hair from this brush than on my body. It literally will not stop shedding on me. I'm submitting it for a refund or at least a replacement. And buyer beware. I've dropped probably $200 on Tweezerman tweezers and products over the years, NEVER ever have I been disappointed."
3,odd gift,It was a gift for our father who is 89 years old and only knows this way of applying any shaving product and his old one was worn down very far.
1,Whole Bristle bundle came out of its handle,"Using this bristle once a week , each time a little toomany bristles falls out, and then just after 3 monthsthe bristle bundle broke loose from the handle.Where was the quality controller for this product?!Its just bad! considering one paid 15 dollars plus shippingNever again Tweezerman"
1,fell apart,"The bristles began to shed after about a month, then the glue completely released all of them in a clump from the handle after 5 months. I always stored the brush suspended upside down."
5,Super for the price!,"Some 8 months ago I took the plunge into switching from a cartage razor to a double edge setup. Not wanting to dump a lot of money into something I wasn't sure I'd continue to do, I purchased this brush along with the other necessities to start shaving. I knew full well it was made in China and one of the cheapest brushes out there so my expectations were low. So far, I have been VERY pleased with the performance. Once the brush is 'broken in', the bristles offer a great balance between water retention, stiffness and softness. The first few times I used it I noticed 2 or 3 shed hairs and absolutely none after the first week. I told myself hat I would 'upgrade' brushes if I kept up with double edge shaving but there's no need. I have a feeling I'll be using this for a long time!"
4,Excellent Starter Brush,This makes an excellent starter Badger brush and is of much better quality than many of the other starter brushes. It has lots of scritch and makes mountains of lather with the right soap or cream. The brush only shed 1 to 2 hairs the whole time I had it and not another one. I have since moved on to another badger brush which was much more expensive. Great brush for the money!!
2,Not made well,It seemed like a quality brush when I first bought it. It lathered up well but the bristles were a little course. After about two months of daily use the section that held the bristles fell out. I tried to glue it back in but it wasn't the same and didn't look very nice.
3,"Still Shedding, Hair Everywhere","This is a good brush to use when you're getting started because it's cheap. If you choose to go back to your previous shaving routine, you're only out $12. But once you decide to stick with wet shaving, I would recommend getting another brush.I have been using this brush for about two months, and it is still shedding hair all over my face. I dig 2 or 3 hairs from this brush out of my freshly-applied shaving cream every morning."
4,tweezerman shave brush,"Upon arrival the brush is much larger than I had anticipated.During the first use, I did have to pull one or two bristles off my face, but other than that - it exfoliates really well and doesn't feel cheap. The amount of bristles make the brush very wide and they are almost too firm - but I imagine the more I use it, the more comfortable it will become. All in all, if you're looking for a brush that does what it's supposed to and you aren't incredibly concerned with how fancy it is - this is it! The price it right."
5,Best quality brush I have seen.,"I have bought other brushes that have fallen apart in a month, but this is a very good quality. Make sure you hang it up to dry with a brush holder and it will last for a long time."
2,Only adequate,"If you're only dipping your toe in the area of wet shaving, this brush is ""OK"" for a start but not much more than that. It loses hairs after every use. The hairs have been trimmed to make the shape and it is ""scritchY"" on your face. NOT representative of a good badger hair brush and there are probably better boar hair brushes out there at his price point."
5,Tweezerman Men's Shaving Brush,"Well, I bought the Tabac Soap at the same time and someone in a review said by a Badger Brush... and recommended Tweezermans' for the price... and he was right on the money. Very soft and lathers the soap up very nice... drys quickly and lathers your face with a thick coating quickly. I've always enjoyed shaving and this just makes it even more fun. Now if I can just find a great razor!"
3,Not sure,Am taking this but not sure if it is working or not. Still have bloating and gas no matter what I do or leave off. Frustrating to me not to mention uncomfortable.
1,Cheap,Bristle base with bristles came out of the handle within weeks. Have not yet been able to glue it back in. Return it? Why wouldn't the same breakage happen with another?
2,Kinda cheap,"This is kind of cheap. The bristles keep falling out. The bristles are very sharp and poke my face, my Crabtree and Evelene brand brush has not had one bristle fall out and is very soft and doesn't poke at all. It works if you don't want to spend double/triple for a high quality brush."
3,Tweezerman brush reviewed,"I like the brush as far as size, how it lathers and it is a nice brush. However it does shed quite a bit. I have used it @5-6 times and it is better but it still sheds."
3,A workable brush for the price.,The brush arrived as advertised in the time frame promised. The bristles are hard and shed a little for the first week. Make sure you dry your brush properly between uses to maximize brush life. For the price this product worked as well as I expected it to.
4,Nice Brush for Cheap,"Just got this product. It was cheap (yay) and much better than any other brush I've been able to buy for $15 or less. It is a little sparsely haired compared to some of the others that I have looked into but that's to be expected for the bargain basement price.You can buy 2-3 of these, at a minimum, for the same price that you would a nicer more luxurious brush.If you're looking for something inexpensive and a small step up from boars hair, I say go for it. (I did.)"
1,fell apart,the brush came apart from the base. I will never order this brand again. I was expecting so much more...
5,"Great Brush, Great Value","Great Brush Great Value, I store brushes proper and take care of them will see how long it lasts. All brushes eventually just wear out"
3,Lasted 11 Months...,"Well, my Tweezerman brush busted after 11 months... the brush/bristles separated from the handle. It was never dropped, and always hung with the bristles down to dry. When it was in working order, I loved it. I used it to make lather with the C.O. Bigelow cream in a ceramic cappuccino mug. It was great. It was my first brush (I also bought my first DE razor with this brush), so I have nothing to compare it to, but when I used it, it was wonderful.It held water (and heat) and lather really well. Good stiffness, and minimal shedding (shedding stopped after first five-ish shaves). So, overall, I am pleased with this brush's performance, but not pleased with its longevity and lifespan. Though, I suppose you get what you pay for. I would order it again, but I figured, why keep spending the $20 when I could buy a $40 badger brush which will hopefully last much longer."
3,Nice Digest of Napoleon's Influence on France,"Horne's pithy little book is certainly not a good introduction to Napoleon the man, general, or emperor, nor a comprehensive history text on France. It is, however, a valuable collection of his most lasting and significant policies, ambitions, whims, excesses, successes, and failures.Horne writes with the facile hand of an expert in his element, yet this book will certainly prove most valuable to the casual rather than novice or advanced scholar of Napoleonic France. It covers his rise to fame, deceptively humble power-grab, impressive reformist tendencies and initiatives, his staid morality contrasting personal hypocrisy, as well as Napoleon's creation of a new and (at least in theory) merit-based aristocracy, as well as the advent of modern French culture. Colorful episodes featuring his beloved Josephine as well as other flames and vixens are recounted.This will be a nice addition to a Francophile shelf, but only a sketchy entry text for the curious."
3,A summary of Napoleon and his accomplishments at home.,"For those seeking a biography of the man or his military accomplishments, this book does not fit the bill. Horne focuses on the political, economic, artistic, and scientific accomplishments of Napoleon and the Napoleonic Regime. So this book focuses on an area not covered by most authors. Since Napoleon is a topic that many authors have attempted, Horne focuses on an area not usually written about. Napoleon changed a lot in France, and Horne outlines both his accomplishments (Code of Napoleon for law, and scientific research) and his failures (theater, opera, and literature).This is not an easy read, despite its brevity. It is a read that will enlighten a Napoleonic historian. However, the subjects and concepts are more difficult to understand than themilitary victories."
1,Not an enjoyable read,"I don't recommend this book unless you're already familiar with the entire history of Napoleon. It's filled with vague references, assumes the reader lives in the writer's world with the references he doesn't explain, and uses many French sentences without any translation.I bought this small book, hoping it would be a quick, interesting read. I found it was neither.On the other hand, if you enjoy French arrogance, you might enjoy working through this book."
4,Dark thoughts,"A quite refreshing new look at jazz, Garzone provides a story in each song he plays. I assure future buyers, this is a ""must have"" cd for all jazz lovers. Just listen to the dark emotoins that stem from his horn. A cd unlike many out there."
2,Well....,All my friends told me that I absoloutly HAD to read this book and that it was sooooo great. I took it home to read it and...it wasn't worth all that praise. It was pretty boring actually. I think maybe it's a love it or hate it type of book. I was the latter.
3,engaging,"Reading this book with my child was easy. The illustrations gave way to more imagination about the story, we both loved it."
3,Good Illustrations kept it going,"A legend about a boy who falls out of his family wagon as they are crossing the country. He is forced to raise himself in the wide open west and learn how to protect his life.This was an ok book from my point of view. The illustrations were amazing they really kept my attention. However, the writing was nothing too spectacular. The story of Pecos Bill is one of adventure and I just didn't feel like this version of the story captured the really adventure of the legend. This book sends the message of standing up for yourself and never giving up on your dream. I think it did a good job of getting the message across and my second graders knew what the message was as soon as a closed the book."
2,lacks grit - too nice,"While the book is filled with huge illustrations, the edge has been taken off the story. Part of what made the Pecos Bill story appealing when I was a child was the danger involved and the rough and ready lifestyle. This is just too ""white bread"" - boring, bland, yawn inducing. They completely domesticated Widowmaker (his horse), referring to him as ""Lightening"" for the majority of the story. On the plus side, the story retains a few more elements than Kellogg's abyssmal rendering of Paul Bunyan."
4,Good background for Ciano's diary,"Moseley has written a readable and well researched book on the life of the enigmatic Count Ciano. It is certainly the first comprehensive study of Ciano to appear in English. Ciano is worthy of the attention of anyone interested in Twentieth Century Europe, diplomacy, or World War II. Moseley does a good job of revealing Ciano's evolution from a blind follower of Mussolini to active and effective foil. There can be little doubt that in anything less than an unrestricted dictatorship, Ciano's efforts to keep Italy out of WWII would have succeeded. In the end Ciano's undisguished contempt of the Nazi Heirarchy cost him his life. I recommend this book as a precursor to reading Ciano's diary."
3,"Very good, could have been better","This is a good book and Mr. Moseley is to be congratulated on a decent job. He has done his research and provided a vivid account of Ciano and the people around him. I do not give this book five stars, however, because it needs editing. It seems in some places Mr. Moseley loses his strong narrative as he relates diary entry after diary entry - seemingly with little connection. Also, the book could have used a glossary containing the names of the principal players in the Italian fascist government. These faults lie not with Mr. Moseley as much as with his editor/publisher. Nevertheless, I rcommend this book as one that provides a fascinating slice of WWII history."
2,Good looking book but.,"This book looks good, with lots of pictures and sausage mixes. I have been making sausages for a living for twenty years, I have won many local competions including currently holding the title for supreme champion of hampshire UK. When I first started reading this book I thought these will not work and how right I was. When I changed a few things around the sausages came out ok. This book is not as it states PROFESSIONAL."
2,don't buy this,"not impressive to complex for a intro to cureing too minimal for advance cureing. I would suggest ""Charcuterie"" if your a beginner or ""Great Sausage Recipes and meat curing""(Kutas)for advance."
1,"Professional charuterie: Sauasage making, Curing, terrines, pates","Oh my god I just read Thomas kellers book it's the Best!! This book on the other hand, is mediocrity at best. The author takes up countless pages of out dated equipment and definitions of things like what a crushed red pepper is. I can only say that as a Professional chef this book is a total disappointment. Don't spend your money on the Rytek book either the only book is Thomas Kellers"
2,A Commericial Text,This book is for the professional cook in mind not for homestead sasuage makers. It is not what i was looking for.
4,Popular Romantic Comedy by the Creator of Ranma 1/2,"Ataru is an average teenager - school, a girlfriend (Shinobu), and the hormones of twenty or thirty men. This last tends to get him into trouble.When Ataru returns home one day to find a crowd surrounding his home, he doesn't know that his life is about to change completely! He soon discovers that an alien race, the Oni, have chosen him as Earth's champion in a game of tag. The prize - the earth itself. Lecherous Ataru is only too happy to participate when he sees that his opponent is the beautiful, tiger-skin bikini-clad Lum.Only problem is, nobody told him Lum could fly...What happens during the race takes up only the first chapter of this very funny book, which was a very popular manga (comic book) and anime (cartoon) in Japan before being brought to the United States. Can Ataru remain true to Shinobu for more than 15 minutes straight? Will Lum manage to trap him into marrying her? Will Ataru survive crossing Lum? Lots of fun!"
4,"Good, but not the best","Let me get this straight: This is an excellent series. I really do enjoy it. However, it lacks the sweetness of Rumiko Takahashi's other works. While the insanity and confusion is defintely hilarious, there is very little character development beyond that Ataru is a ..., unlucky skirt chaser, Lum is an alien completely devoted to Ataru who hates being hit on, etc. etc. whereas Ms. Takahashi's other series have more character development, actually romantic romantic comedy, stuff that makes you alternately say awwwwww and gasp with startlement, drama, and all those good things. So I subtracted a star. If you want a series to get involved in, with deep characters and emotional attachment, don't read this one. Go get Ranma 1/2 or Maison Ikkoku or Inu-Yasha. If you want a lighthearted comedy with funny characters, then this is the series for you."
1,VASTLY OVER-RATED!!!,"Perhaps I'm just too old, but I just didn't think too much of this book! I did not laugh once, or even smile at any of the stories. These characters are two-dimensional! There doesn't appear to be any character growth at all, and the premise is highly ridiculous! Why would Lum (or any woman) be attracted to Ataru? The only good thing about him is that he (probably) flushes the toilet! The only manga that I ever laughed out loud from reading was ""3 X 3 Eyes"", which has genuine comic elements (and character growth), even though it's mostly horror/action."
3,Caring for Patients of Different Cultures,"The book arrived in a quick fashion. The book contained a little bit more highlighting than I expected, but in reality, that was not a problem."
4,Okay book,This book is actually not bad for personal reading and course requirement. I did enjoy the book and it was very practical meeting the course objectives.
3,tough topic,Did not find this to be all that much different informationwise than the other healthcare culture sensitivity books out there
3,"Good football story, but dated","Rebel Halfback is a college football story set in the time it was written - 1947 - that tries to combine some WW2-inspired ideas about democracy with Archibald's tried and true formula of young athetes succeeding against the odds. Modern readers will be a little confused by the accurate but dated way the football action is described. Archibald tells a good story but I didn't like this book as much as some of his other's that make ""the big challenge"" a little more personal and not quite so preachy."
1,Quite simply the worst Dr Who novel ever,"What a disaster.I'd believe this book to be one giant inside joke if the po-faced first few chapters had not been so deadly serious. I cannot describe quite how much this book disappointed me. So I will not even attempt to. The lack of color on the cover will tell you every single thing you need to know. Never has a title been more appropriate. Grim, in every sense of the word."
1,Confused Academic Drivel,"The author engages in loose, impressionistic musing about problems in the highly politicized field of social science. On page 56, for instance, during a discussion of the use of the term ""gendered,"" Sayer writes, ""On the whole, I find it hard to think of much that is good about masculinity."" Sayer is arguing, however, that we shouldn't assume that everything masculine is bad, as some in the field tend to do. And why not? Well, it's difficult to say what is masculine and what is not (56-58); these are rather general rubrics. Why, then, does Sayer express disdain for most things that are masculine? Probably to avoid getting into trouble by appearing to be pro-masculine in spite of his attempt to argue that masculinity is not always bad. Books like this will occupy the landfills of the near future, and rightly so."
4,Good quality supplement at a good price,"Metabolic Maintenance makes very high quality supplements and 5 HTP is no exception. Beside high quality ingredients since I started taking 5 HTP my husband has noticed an improvement in my mood, so I will continue to take it. What could be simpler than taking an amino acid to make you happier?"
2,NOT SILK!!,Received them stating 100% polyester! They are pretty but a little short and the white one is quite grayish. I guess they are okay for the money but feel that calling them silk is a deception!
1,True beach read.,"Three girls with three completely different backgrounds become au pairs and travel to the Hamptons for a summer of work and play. By day, they are nannies to the Perry children but by night, they party and hang with the rich and famous. Sounds like a good plot right? I thought so until I read the first few pages. The plot is quite similar to the ""Sunset Island"" series and ""The Nannies"" series but it doesn't have much innocence. Instead, it is about the latest fashion trends, drinking, partying, boys, and sex. Not to mention the stereotypical characters. This is a true beach read but if you want some advice, once you're done throw the book into the ocean."
5,Excellent,"This book is a great read that goes by fast. I had a really hard time putting it down. The character differences are great and it made me want to continue. I found it to be fast paced and I was hooked from the get go. No I am not a young adult, but I do enjoy quick light reading and that's exactly what it was. I give it five stars with a smile."
3,Disappointing,"I am glad I did not buy this book. It looks like a really good read. It has elements similar to Gossip Girl but is severely lacking. The story is predictable and extremely corny at parts. If someone with more writing experience would take this novel and rewrite it with the same characters and same basic story, it could be great. Not worth the price though."
1,BORING & SIMPLISTIC--DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"I was an au pair last summer, and wanted to like this book. But it's as if publishers now think that anyone they throw in front of a computer can write teen chick lit and girls will buy it. I adored the A LIST which is smart and well-written as well as smarmy and fun. GOSSIP GIRLS was fun for one book and then it got old. This didn't hold me for 30 pages and if you have a functioning brain it won't hold you, either."
2,Mediocre,"The Au Pairs was a decent book, not bad but not good. It was quite predictable in that sort of way, where everything turns out OK and everyone ends up happy. It's a good book if you have the time to waste and aren't looking for anything serious. If you are, then stray far, far away from it."
3,"Entertaining, quick read.","The AuPairs is about three young women who are taking care of a group of rambunctious, rich children. The story takes place in the Hamptons, an area famous for its wealthy and famous summer occupants.Eliza is a former IT girl, and is in for a rude awakening when she realizes her new station as a worker rather than a reveler. Mara is small town and innocent, a bit naive and maybe a little bit backward. Jaqui is hot and knows it. And uses it to her advantage.I fell in love with the characters even as I wanted to shake them at times.The only thing that bothered me about the book was the name dropping and the fad references. I feel those could hurt the timeliness of the story. Will a Hummer H2 really be top of the line in ten years?Otherwise, a fun read; and a nice peek into the lives of the rich and priviledged."
4,This is so Great!,"Just because I'm a kid doesn't mean I don't know good books. This one was great! It should be read by all teens. The first couple of chapters were kind of hard to follow, but keep going. I couldn't put it down. I read it all in one day! It is one of my favorites. Don't get this from the library, make an extra trip to Border's!"
5,This starts off 2003 with a bang!,"If you don't know Eric Person's work, or you know him as a sideman with Dave Holland or Chico Hamilton, then dig this!This knocked me outta my seat. It's LIVE, so you get what makes Meta-Four a great touring band. Get it, you wont be sorry."
3,compilation of blues tracks from the 20s through the 60s,"this is an interesting selection of old blues songs that have had some influence on captain beefhearts music. scattered throughout the disc, there are some short spoken word stuff by the good captain and two musical tracks, Best Batch Yet and Flaming Autograph with the magic band. my only complaint is that there is not more of his stuff on the disc. sound quality obviously varies as there's four decades of different blues songs, but they are all listenable. very cool packaging and artwork, and some descriptions of the artists provided. at 34 tracks, it's not the kind of cd i'd sit down and listen to all at once unless i was doing some busy work around the house. it is fun though to enjoy some of the more obscure blues recordings that this cd provides."
4,"Overall, a great kite!","I recently purchased this kite as an upgrade for a cheaper kite that I bought on the coast. I it was able to take some hard hits with the ground and is awesome in flight. It is fast and very responsive. The only reason I ranked it a 4 instead of 5 is that the lines it came with were different lengths. I was able to email Nexus and they are sending me replacement lines, but after reading other reviews I know several others have reported the same problem.Overall, a great entry kite and a lot of fun!"
1,I think Prism changed contract manufacturer,"Got an older Nexus from 2008 (with the rectangular product tag), it flies great and pretty durable too. Crashed it numerous times before the spine stopper finally punctured after a year. Now the Nexus from 2010 (with the square product tag), spine stopper punctured on third crash. Returned it and the next one punctured on the very first crash. E-mailed Prism and got an automated response, nothing else.I'm done with Prism."
1,Stay away!,"I bought this belt clip thinking that it would be just what i was looking for. Looked good in the picture, so i ordered one. When it arrived i said, hmmm, looks nice, works nice, lets try it. Put my little LG tm510 (which is a great phone) in the leather case and clipped it to my belt. Went to sit down with it and it broke immediately.It is not fixable. This is really a piece of junk, and i'm sure lots of people are having the same problem. Stay away!!!!! This is a piece of garbage. If someone gave it to you as a gift, politely decline.Fortunately the dealer i bought it from knew this to be a fact, and creditted my account immediately."
2,"Not very durable, doesn't hold tight","The clip has a great design in that there's no way for an item to accidently fall out of it. However, the adhesive used to mount the ""knob"" to your phone (or whatever) isn't strong enough. I've had items fall off the clip solely because the glue isn't holding as it should."
3,useful...until....,"Very useful until you get a new phone. Once you stick the clip on the back of your phone, good luck getting it off and being able to use it again..."
5,Great for researchers,If you are doing research in polymer science this is the book to have. If you want to learn polymer chemistry get another more simple polymer book. There are chapters in here that you will use.
4,"Good Textbook, Better Reference","Like most textbooks, its verbose and hard to read at times. However, if one were to study polymers for more than just a course, it makes a handy reference tool unlike any other I or my friends have come across. Having this book for other courses would have been worth paying full price (but you don't have to) and I only wish I had come across it earlier."
4,Lost cd,product4less has contacted me several times -he is doing his best to get cd to me after p.o. returned it to him in error. ican't get to the place necessary to change feedback.
3,More hits,"I bet this guy will come out with a greatest hits 3, maybe even GH4 before he is done. He just knows how to write songs."
2,"Compressed sound, too loud compared to other music","I love Alan Jackson, he is one of my favorite vocalist. But this and his other greatest hit CD is mixed compressed and to loud. Having it on my music list while listening on my headphones causes me to rip off my headphones when his music comes on and blows out my eardrums. This has happen once to often. I now have removed these two albums from my music list to save my ears.To listen to his music anymore, I have to be careful and set my music low enough to get a better sound level. So I listen less often now to Alan Jackson."
1,Allen Jackson - Greatest Hits Volume II,"I am thrilled with the CD. I play the piano and purchased the sheet music to ""Remember When"". I decided to search the internet for the CD so that I could play the piano along with the CD. I have other sheet music that I have purchased CDs to play along with it."
5,Great CD!,"I LOVE this CD!! I bought it particularly for 'Remember When' and the song about 9-11, but the rest of it is great as well. He has a very rich, easy-to-listen-to voice, which does justice to everything he sings. I don't think I've ever heard him sing a 'bad song!'"
4,Great collection,"This is a great collection of some of Alan Jackson's best material. Almost all of the tunes here are worthy of a place on a ""best of"" collection. Only one or two could be considered ""filler"". I especially like the thoughtful musical arrangements supporting his material. Jackson really stands out among Country artists in his attention to musical details. This is really a ""can't miss"" for those who enjoy Country music, with appeal for pop fans as well."
4,Great product but...,"The product is great and fits nicely with all of the chrome I got on my H2 Hummer. It will interfere with the H2's towing hooks though, but again I don't use those hooks for towing purposes. I am a bit disappointed though from Amazon. I've been using Amazon for the last 7 years and they are great. But for this purchase it was supposed to be a NEW product when I bought it but apparently they sent me a used ""returned"" item. The product's box was all messed up when I got it and it was missing the locking hitch pin as well. Fortunately I had ordered a key locking pin as well so I didn't bother the missing pin that didn't come with the product."
5,Trailer Hitch Step,"I bought this for my son and he loves it. It is shiny, strong and improves the look of his truck/SUV. He also uses it to wash the top of his truck. Excellent Find!"
2,Des the job.,"Purchased this for a step up to my camper on my 03 Tundra. Fairly well built but it fits loose in the receiver. I wrapped Rhino tape around it which took some of the slack out of it. The included clamp that is supposed to keep the step from from feeling wobbly as you step on it is useless. The hand bolt to secure it is too short to get the threads started. The other issue is the tube fills up with water when it rains. The black anti-slip plastic piece you see pictured allows sitting water to enter the holes beneath it where it is held in place. I wouldn't think water is a good thing to have inside a metal tube. Besides that, when you take the step off be careful where you store it as the {rusty) water will leak out. I'm tempted to pop the plastic piece off to silicone seal it in place but I'm afraid of breaking whatever tabs are there to hold it in place. Hard to recommend this product. It works but was it worth the price?? Don't think so."
1,dud--as true crime films go,"Poorly written, directed and acted.How do you take a powerful story such as this and turn it into something so banaland uninteresting?Well, they managed to do it here.A waste of time.RE: cast: Tobin Bell, who was so quirky and convincing in Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, doesn't do muchin this film at all that is worth watching--and I suspect it isn't even his fault. This entire flick is absolutely without any merit whatsoever. Too bad.Maybe one day a talented filmmaker will get it right."
4,"Good Book, especially for new modelers","This book has several projects. Each one increases in difficulty. If you'r new to this hobby, this is a great book. You learn what tools and techniques are needed to produce good-looking models. An experienced modeler probably knows alot of the info in this books already. Only one, small chapter is dedicated to display so don't expect anything stellar in that area. All in all an interesting book on everyones favorite hobby."
3,"Good, but very basic...","This is a good book but it is very basic. It tries to use specific models building projects to show techniques. I like the way it starts with a basic snap-together F-117 and goes up to major modification of an existing kit. Unfortunately it doesn't go deep enough into each kit to really show the techniques. On the plus side, the photography is great and mostly in color. I would recommend this if you are just getting started but I think anything beyond that would be disappointed."
5,Terror on the high seas,This was a romantic and action packed heart warming tale. I enjoyed it and once I picked it up it was extremely difficult to put down. I am really enjoying this entire series.
2,Unbelievable Fiction,"Where I have tolerated and even enjoyed the previous books in this series, I have had enough. Really? Dar Roberts is too fictional to even tolerate. There's not even 25% of her personality that is believable enough to be enjoyable in this book. I am also sick and tired of Kerry going on and on about how conservative is okay. Look she's a smart lesbian, couldn't her personality have evolved better than her still holding on to this ridiculous Republican view of the world. She clearly has not met enough non white, right and rich people in the world; which by the way makes NO SENSE....she lives in Miami...Seriously?? I hope young lesbians do not read this series...they will be very disappointed in the poor depiction of non rich white people. I wish I could get my money back from this entire series. The ONLY reason this book gets two stars is because I appreciate the special emotional and physical bond that Kerry and Dar have as a couple and as best friends."
2,"I expected to get more ""usable"" information but I didn't","The problem with this book is that the scholarships listed are based on the SCHOOL/COLLEGE that gives the scholarships. In other words it will list (in alphabetical order) for example: Juilliard. and then tell you the scholarships that JUILLIARD offers. It doesn't have much of a listing of national scholarships that can be used at any school. It makes this book pretty useless, because once you choose what school you're going to, all you need to do is ask the SCHOOL what scholarships they offer. About 95% of this book is useless because 99% of the schools in there were schools I was not going to even APPLY to, so I didn't even need to know their scholarships.don't get the book, call the school you're going to and ask them. OR search for scholarships on the internet."
1,non-usable information for me too!,"I was IMMENSELY disappointed with this book, as I was expecting more versatile information. ALL the scholarships in this book are exclusively limited to schools. But what about the national scholarships that seem to appear throughout the country no matter what school you go to? This book ignores those, and truth be told, you could save yourself the money and just ask the schools that you find in your search what scholarships they offer yourself. I would recommend this book as a good buy."
1,This is terrible..,I don't know what they were on when they made this one (acid?). Having Blue magically learn to talk suddenly implies that she was somehow completely impaired when she talked like a dog for all the other shows. This is a lame direction for a previously excellent show to take. Talk about jumping the shark.
1,Not the Best Episodes!,"I did not like this DVD at all! I am a Blues Clues fan and my little boy loves the DVDs; but I wish I could return this one.Nick Jr. should have stuck with its original format for Blue Clues. Blue Talks is lame (especially when you compare it to the other episodes). The dialogues for the characters are cheesy and not as exciting as the other DVDs.Blue Talks did not hold my 18 month old's interest like the others do. If you're looking for Blues Clues DVDs, I suggest making this one the last on your list, if you buy it at all. Instead, get Shapes and Colors, Blues Big Band, Blue Takes you to School, Classic Blues, or Blue's Big Musical Movie. All of them are ten times better than Blue Talks!"
1,Not very good,"The case protects well from things from the outside, however, the stitches around the plastic covering over the screen scratch and scuff the player on the inside. I am sending it back and getting a different case. It is also very bulky."
3,Creative Zen V:M Now Scratched,"While this case fits the Creative Zen V:M pretty well -- in contradiction to a previous review, it is a little loose -- the inside of the case does not do a very good job of protecting the player's finish. My player has several cosmetic belmishes on the front from top to bottom, which kind of defeats one of the primary purposes of getting a case in the first place."
1,sooooooooo disappointing,"This album will be a complete let-down for anyone who likes the first two NMA albums. I sat in my living room staring at my stereo with a mix of horror and disbelief. I literally picked the CD cover up off the coffee table because I thought maybe I had somehow bought the wrong CD. If you like Top 40 lightweight pop stuff like 741 and Jimmy Eats World, this is right up your alley.But if you're a North Mississippi Allstars fan, you should only buy this CD if you actually want to have your spirits crushed. It is, honest to god, that bad."
2,Depends on what you like,"If the Beatles had made this album, you would think ""The Beatles have put some southern rock/blues into their sound"". If the Allman Brothers Band had put out this album, you would think ""Wow, this is a really hip, modern sound"". Unfortunately, this is a North Mississippi Allstars album.Polaris heralds a new direction for this band - a smoother, quieter direction. This is far from the raw, blues-rock of Shake Hands With Shorty or 51 Phantom. This is a more pacified Allstars. Gone is the Marshall stack cranked up to 11; in are layered harmonies and strings.Again, it depends on what you like. Shorty and Phantom will continue to get loud plays on my CD player; Polaris will not. What can I say? I like my Allstars loud and raw."
5,This Is What I Want To Hear,"Over the last decade, radio has not had a true home for NEW Rock and Roll. If you didn't scream, grunge, rap, appear half naked, or dance with four other people that remarkably aren't you but are amazingly similar in every detail, then you probably had no home on the radio.This CD deserves a home. Create a radio station around it. Create a genre. It's that good.Listen to it once. Take a deep breath. Stop Shaking. Wipe the smile off of your face. Then play it 100 more times.Rock and Roll is back."
2,Fewer Stars for the All-Stars,Another step backwards for a band that had already stepped back with their sophmore offering. Their first disc reminded me of the best efforts from great power trios Cream & Rush; this CD reminds me more of [forgettable] releases from [forgettable] pop trios Bananarama & Culture Club. Let's hope NMAS finds its all-star form again.
1,A waste of good money!,"Well, one listen to this dirg and it's for sale!, what is this?, corporate rock?, did they owe an album and just dumped out what was in the can?, strings?????, where is the grit?, the power?, dumb songs!!!, please, give us some more power blues rock! Well, now if I had to judge, Reckless Kelly is the best band in the USA right now!"
2,Too pop sounding,"Like all jam-bands the CD rarely captures the essence of the band, their live show ability, or their musicianship. There are exceptions to the rule but generally these bands are meant to be seen. This album is a perfect example of that. The Allstars put on a fantastic show but this CD does not reflect their true talents. It is too pop sounding most of the time and when they do let loose it is for too short a period of time. Expanding the repartee is a good thing when you are building off your core strengths. POP is not (thank god) a strength of the Allstars. I'm a big fan of this band and see them every chance I get but this CD is a disappointment and would not be one I would use to introduce someone to them. Either of their pervious CDs is a better choice. Fortunately I have a few live recordings that really capture the bands talent. It is those I will continue to listen to until I see them again."
1,As bad as you've heard!,I suppose you cant blame a band for trying to branch out but there has to be some decent tunes to branch out with. There are three tracks here which are without doubt among the worst i've heard and much of the remainder is fairly flimsy. Theres a distinct lack of slide guitar which seems peverse when you have on board the most talented slide player in years. I dont know where they go from here as they rightly seem to be reluctant to simply rehash the brilliant 'shake hands with shorty' but this is a shocker. I bet they're still fabulous live though!
4,great album,"this album is a great. it's bluesy, soulful, rockin, psychadelic. the main sound allman brothers-esque southern rock, but it's pretty diverse and the album has a good pop feeling all around. i personally like most of the songs on the first half of the album. the second half of the album is mostly songs with lyrics about sun rises and sunsets. it's still great though. i'm not going to talk about all of the songs. however, i will talk about the first and last song. ""eyes"" is a great opener. rockin intro, soulful R&B chorus. the lyrics of the first verse are awesome ""i ain't never been to heaven/ but i've been told/ angel's in heaven got/ sweet jelly rolls"". ""be so glad"" is a great song. it's like blues and rock and hip-hop rolled into one. the rap is F**king awesome. the song ends with an allman brothers-esque instrumental. overall, i approve."
1,You Got To Be Kidding?,What were they thinking? Keep playing this stuff and you won't have any fans. Better listen to the first two CDs again and go back to your roots. Don't do this to us.
1,I hate to say I hate it,"shake hands with shorty was the raw goods, but the groceries have been stale since. so much promise, but things have gone downhill. i wanted so badly to like polaris but this could be the kiss of death for the once beloved all-stars. it has just become apparently obvious that a songwriter does not exist in this band--cody is one of the best drummers out there and luther has talent, but there is no doubt--they need songwriting help. they can only lean on junior and r.l for so long until the weakeness is exposed--call jerry joseph, vic chesnutt, chris whitley or someone to lend a hand boys..."
3,"Good, but with limitations","I use these for my commute to work each day, they're pretty handy and hold a decent amount. I pack a change of clothes, different shoes, lunch, an ipod, and a few other miscellaneous things without even utilizing their full capacity. The are easy to mount to any luggage rack on a mountain bike, simply clip it on and you go. My one complaint is that if I hit rough pavement too fast they have come off as the only have clips that sit on the edge of the rack and an elastic cord to hook onto the sides by the wheels. I've gotten around this by using plastic ties to ensure that if they come loose they won't detach from the bike. It would be nice if they fastened more securely, however."
2,Lalan,"Good condition for the cd, rapid delivery. The cd is not good as I believe. Anyway is good music.Thank's a lotAle"
5,Great Study!!,"""Life Applications"" does not even begin to describe it. Galatians tells the beginning of Christianity for the Gentiles (non-Jews). I have learned so much!! Highly recommend!"
2,not bright at all,"i would not call ths a flood light! i would call this a porch light, or accent lighting. this is only 2 very yellow colord light bulbs that barley light up a portion of a small area. when i turn on my small maglight it completly drownws out the light of this weak flood light. i think they are a good deal if you are looking for a cheap light that can be pointed in a specific direction but i will be looking for something else with some brightness to it."
2,My kids prefer Madagascar,"My kids didn't really seem to like this movie. I don't know whether having watched Madagascar (which they love) prior to watching this movie played into it, but they really had no interest in this movie. I ended up selling it at a yard sale."
3,it's ok,"too predictable, my kids lost interest in the first 10 min. Kids kept comparing with Madgascar but it was nothing like it."
2,Should have stayed in The Wild,The move was more like a copy of The Lion King and Madagascar than an original move but was good enough to hold the attention of my 5 and 3 year old.
1,Disney still needs to fire some people,"This is a pretty bad movie.- The story is nowhere near novel- The director is incredibly bad- The writer is incredibly bad- The movie overall is pretty badDisney needs to understand that good movies are created by good creative artists, not bad ones (seems obvious but not to Disney). Please hire good people."
1,Not appropriate for young children...,"We took our two and a half year old to see this movie thinking that it was going to be like Madagascar or Over the Hedge. My husband and I were both shocked at the amount of violence. The bad guys were terrifying: rabid dogs roaming the streets of New York, wildebeests gone carnivore, and a raving lunatic koala bear...We left before it got worse...but my son still woke that night having nightmares about the wildebeests."
4,It's actually very good!!!,"I was afraid to see this movie after reading the other reviews and knowing it's ""another"" animal animated movie....However....it's actually very good. It has a good story line and the computer animation is excellent. I really think it should have gotten more publicity in a postive way. Anyway, I do recommend it for adults and children alike. You'll enjoy it."
1,A train wreck of a movie -- don't waste your time,"This movie is astoundingly bad. Okay, the animation is decent, but the story is horrible, the screenplay atrocious, and the characters are one-dimensional and unlovable. Just because they're animals doesn't make them funny or cute or even at all interesting. The plot is predictable in most places, and completely bizarre in the others. The movie can't decide whether it's trying to be funny or a heart-touching relationship story, and in the end it's neither. Avoid this one -- lots of better choices out there."
1,silly film,This film copied madagascar i think disney thought [the film madagascar is really popular let's make a exact copy] dont bother watching this film its not good anyway its so rubbish it dosent introduce the charechters wether chicken little does read my chiken little reivew
1,ALOT OF JUNK MOVIES HAVE BEEN RELEASED LATELY,"and this is one of them. The characters were to silly to be funny,the musically shorts were dim, animation was cheap, unusual for Disney,and the script was bad. Suitable for those 5 and under."
1,PURE GARBAGE,"THIS MOVIE WASN'T GOOD IN NO FORM OF LIGHT AT ALL! THE SINGING WASN'T GOOD,THE ANIMATION WASN'T GOOD, AND THE STORY LINE WAS FAR OFF OF REALITY !PREY TRYING TO EAT PREDATOR WAS OVER THE TOP STUPID!"
3,It's OK 2,"All right, so I finally figured out the squirrel's name. Why would they wanna make a movie like THIS?? Some parts where funny. And the part I pretty much liked was this:(While on the boat; Benny is riding on a bird that's flying down at Bridget)BRIDGET: Oh, please. Would you think that the truth is that a bird would fly down a hit you in the head?BENNY: Aah...! (Bird hits Bridget on the head)BRIDGET: Uhh!(Spinning her head around while the bird with Benny is stuck to her): It's a bat! It's a bat! Get it off! Get it off!"
3,It's OK,"Eh, it's not that bad. I give it 3 stars. Me and my family were a bit late to the theaters. When we went in, we started seeing the part were Ryan was on a tree at the zoo. This movie has a big mix. Such as when Samson fell off the cliff which was VERY simialr to The Lion King. The only part I LOVED was this:(While on the boat; That squirrel is riding a bird, that's flying down at Bridget)BRIDGET: Oh, please. Would you think that the truth is that a bird would fly down and hit you in the head?SQUIRREL: Aah...! (Bird hits Bridget on the head)BRIDGET: Oof! (Spinning her head around while the bird with the squirrel is stuck to her): It's a bat! It's a bat! Get it off! Get it off!"
2,Forgettable,"The Wild is possibly Disney's most forgettable animated movie. Whichever came first, The Wild, or Dreamworks Madagascar, Madagascar is clearly the winner by far. I'll be honest; it's been several weeks since I've seen it and I cannot describe a single scene to you today. I really hope I bought this during the holiday sales because if I paid anything more than half off, I would be very upset. Don't get me wrong. It's not a ""bad"" movie. There's just nothing original in it. Even forgetting Madagascar, it's a rehash of other animated films and TV episodes of the past 50 years. This just won't be one of those movies that gets watched again and again and again..."
3,Kid Made Me Do It,This is one of my son's movies. I put this one right up there with Bolt. Just another happy-go-lucky Disney movie that they are known to mass produce. My favorite is the grumpy koala bear. =)
4,My son loves it,Bought movie after watching it on tv my son is so fascinated by lions and all other zoo animals he loves his madagascar movies so bought this to add to his movie library he loves all the characters and knows the dialogue word by word impressive for a toddler. he loves it that all taht matters in my book
2,ZZZZZZZZZZ,"Very forgettable-no memorable characters, voices put you to sleep-a ""so What"" movie. Not worth the time to watch."
3,The Lion King meets Finding Nemo,"Disney has really run out of new ideas. There are scenes in this movie ripped straight out of other movies. Their own movies too. It's bad enough when someone steals from someone else...but to steal from yourself? That's just pathetic. Still, it is a cute movie with some pretty pictures. Worth a rental."
2,Not so good,"This movie is to madagascar like A bugs Life is to Antz. The only thing is that the movies mention were both excellent movies. I like disney movies very much but if you have to choose between The Wild and Madagascar, Madagascar is a movie that have all the things that make a movie real good. The Wild is boring most of the time, my children didn't laugh and the bad guys are really ugly they even mention The Omen ??? Why?"
2,Too much like Madagascar,"I watched the movie with my 3 year old son and really neither one of us was a big fan. I am used to having movie night after a busy week on Friday. Last Friday was a bit different because we began watching the movie and after about a half an hour my son got up to play with his toys. I know what you may be thinking, after all he is 3, but let me tell you when I put on Madagascar he sits through the whole movie and we have watched that movie about 15 times and he still sits through it all. For my money Disney kind of fell short on this one. I had hoped that it would at least have different kinds of animals for the stars but it was just too similar to Madagascar for our liking."
1,Are you sure this is Disney?,"I expect QUALITY from Disney, and I didn't see quality with this film. It felt like a runner-up knockoff, and not something that anyone actually invested time or effort in. Ok, the animation was interesting, but not interesting enough to hold me for the entire length. It had a few laugh out loud moments, but for the most part, I was bored. And the sound mix on the DVD is awful -- the music swamps the dialogue through much of the movie."
5,The Wild beats Madagascar easily,"First time I watched it with my 4-yr. old grandson drew me in with the relationships (father/son, romantic squirrel/giraffe).Watched it alone and found the technical aspect beats Madagascar with its stiff, jerky character movements. Great subplots and never a dull moment...great running gag( the koala bear doll ) even infected our grandkids who remember every characters name and repeat ""I'm so cuddly I like You"". Funny movie for adults...highly recommended."
3,a good Animated 3-D computer cartoon,"The Wild is a cute Disney film, not up to Disney classic standard. But a good film.A lion father named Samson tells of stories to his cub Ryan of his tales of the Wild. However They live in the zoo.Ryan is shipped to the wild and samson's animal friends come to join him to find his son.There are great character voice talent which makes this film worth watching. Such vocal talents lead by KIefer Sutherland, Willian Shatner, Eddie Izzard, and Jim Belushi bring these animals to life. Richard (Spin Coty) Kind steals the movie as the dumb snakeThis is not up the classic Disney Standards, but what is?Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
5,so much better than Madagascar,"in terms of story and especially animation! and, contrary to an opinion stated by one of the reviewers, Madagascar stole the premiere from The Wild. small wonder, when you see what to what minute detail animation is done in this movie you will know why it took so long to do! really nice movie, lovely characters, wonderful animation. if you need to choose between Madagascar and The Wild, this one steals the show."
4,My Son Liked it...,"Yes this is kinda like Madagascar, however ALMOST every movie has another movie that is similar eg. Finding Nemo and Sharktale. Or it's a remake of an original, let's face it there are only so many ways you can make a movie that will please a wide varity of people. This movie was great because it is set in New York City and the detail is amazing. I bought this movie just before I went on a 4 days business trip to the ""city"" while I left my children at home with their Nana. I wached it with my son before I left and I could show him where I was going. There was a major scene where the animals are in time square and it looks just like the real thing, I was staying very close to Time Square so in a way it helped my son to understand where I was going. So who cares if it's ""similar"" to another movie it's still cute and worth a watch."
2,Thank God Disney Bought Pixar,"After seeing this film, Disney's decision to purchase Pixar was a very good deal. If this is the best Disney computer animators could do, they were in a heap of trouble. NOTE TO DISNEY - Leave the computer animation to Pixar, or at least the story line and voice casting. While the animation was fair, the story was lame and similar to Madagascar. And I really like Kiefer Sutherland in ""24"" but he wasn't that great as the Father Lion."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Wish I had saved my money and popped popcorn and entertained my 3 and 5 year old granddaughters with a double header of Finding Nemo and Madagascar at home. Disney needs a major overhaul if this is the best they can do. The girls hated it and were ready to leave within the first half hour. I thought surely since this was a Disney production it was going to get better. Instead, it continued to spiral downhill. Everyone associated with this production should be on the unemployment line."
3,Disney's Madagascar,This film is a great Child/Family film that is suitable for children of all ages. The one drawback is that it seemed to be a sad attempt at movie similar to DreamWorks Madagascar. There is no Disney magic or even an attempt at sprinkling the pixie dust. My children found the moving rather boring and they lost interest. I would not recommend this movie unless there is nothing else to watch and your kids are screaming at the top of their lungs and you need to shut them up. Choose another movie if you can.
4,good,"verry nice movie,we like it and love to have more of these movies,p.s. we like to see more dancing of the animals and have some more songs in it."
1,Life is too short to watch this movie,"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen and I saw Ishtar. The character development was totally lacking. I never cared about the characters and halfway through my whole family was actually routing for the bad guys. I honestly think the master copy of this movie should be destroyed and Disney should buy back all the copies sold. Don't get me wrong, my family and I love Disney and most of their movies but they really missed the mark on this one."
5,Great movie,What a great movie. My kids ask to see it constantly and I'm sure they know all the lines now. Amazon is great.
2,Pretty intense for little ones,"While somewhat entertaining for older children, this movie was very intense for little ones. I have a 4 year old son and his eyes were very wide at certain points in the movie. He even said that it was scary. The animation was nice, but after seeing Madagascar first, it just didn't keep our interest. I wasn't impressed with all the weird dancing and singing either. Now that I think about it more, the whole thing kind of creeped us out."
4,Entertaining,"My 3 yr old neice loves this movie, and I never get tired of watching it with her. I thought it's contents were much better than Madagascar."
3,Speakerphone needs a better speaker!,"After searching the Internet, this was the the only desktop speakerphone for the Motorola Timeport mobile phone that I could find. According to my clients, the microphone's sound quality is as good as can be expected from a speakerphone, and comparable to my regular desk unit. However, the speaker in this unit is VERY poor. If the volumn is very low, sound quality is tolerable, but then the volumn is very low! Unfortunately, there seems to be few options right now and the free long distance on my Verizon mobile phone service makes this a cost effective choice."
2,dark,"Look great during the day. However, you can not see well at all at night. people cannot see you and they will cut you off. you have to use your brights but then youre shining in people's rearview mirrors. I have researched these for a year and for the price, I recommend a light tint film applied by a professional. When they state, ""for off-road use only"" they mean it."
1,What a disappointment!!,"I purchased this toy for my dog who is a Rottie. When I got the toy in the mail to our surprise it was extremely small and ragged looking. The order listing said it was 10"" but the toy is maybe 6"", if that! I contacted the seller and the response I received is that they list their items based on the UPC code, whatever that is supposed to mean. I strongly advise against this toy."
4,Good Coverage,"This book touches on some important music fundamentals - as they apply to bass playing. Of course, nothing can replace the benefit of studying - thouroughly - and understanding, the circle of fifths and melodic intervals. However, if you want to improve your skill from being a plain old garage bassist, to something more akin to a competent musician, then this book is a good place to start."
4,Annoited By God,"Andrea is an awesome Woman of God, she has poured into many lives and God has and is using her. I am a young lady( Lady Cece) that attends the Potter's House Youth ""Fire House"" and every since God has placed Drea in our lives, he has used her in an awesome way. Drea has a true relationship with God. Praise and Worship in shown true in her heart. I Applause her and thank God for a wonderful gift he has placed inside of her. Lady Drea keep God first and Keep Sanging for the Holy Ghost!! The girl can SANG!!"
5,Share this with everyone,"RECEIVED THE DVD. It was fantastic. Very genuine and caring in its presentation. I cried, laughed and rejoiced in the hope and healing each person received in their own way. I liked the reminder that the EFT is a tool, and the magic is in each of us. Compassionate but with that hard touch of the reality that each of use experiences in our life's journey."
4,Try It Now,EFT is an amazing process for changing negative emotions and Try It On Everything shows and tells us just how to use it effectively.
3,The Tapping Solution,"A very good presentation. It seems a little to simplistic, but still interesting. I'm interested in all healing modalities."
5,It works!!!,"This is an excellent product. For years I have struggled with issues and saw a variety of therapists and tried various anti-depressants and pain medications. This is the first technique I have tried where I have gotten results. Is my pain and depression gone? Not totally. Does it provide relief for me? A resounding, yes!!! Does it make my life more meaningful and manageable? Another yes! Do I still tap? Yes, when I need to. This item is a ""keeper"" and one where you leave it close by and play it from time to time. Each time you play it, you will get something else out of it. What you'll find is not a bunch of jargon and detailed theories but rather a calming story of real people with a variety of issues which also teaches how they obtain relief. Very highly recommended!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. I learned nothing new or exciting. It was originally called ""Try It on Everything"" & I didn't think they tried it on anything different than what is shown on the originals DVDs by Gary Craig.It felt like a commercial for all the experts interviewed on the DVD. I admire all of them but I was not impressed with the info on this DVD. If there are any beginners wanting to learn about EFT, buy Gary Craig's DVD set for a bit more but with way more hours of actually learning & trying on many different problems."
2,never read her before,I have never read one of Penelope Williamson's books before but the ending left somthing to be desired. If I finish a book and I am left hanging and there is no second book I get frustrated. I've read harlequin romances with more complete endings. I guess if the rest of the book han't been so good I wouldn't have minded. I really cared what happened next and now I will never know.
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALL TIME ROMANCES,"I just loved this book! For anyone who remembers the movie ""Witness"", and enjoyed the forbidden love caused by the cultural clash, read this wonderful story and finally achieve satisfaction. Ms.Williamson is an excellent writer who writes equally well when dealing with sensitive isssues, or when building sexual tension between her characters. Just when you think you can't wait any longer...""wham"" she DELIVERS! ""The Outsider"", along with ""Hearts of the West"" are both in my top 5 all time favorite romance reads."
4,The Outsider,"There's no comparing a Penelope Williamson novel to anyone else so I have to compare her to herself. She's awesome! Her writing is rich and transports you to another time and place. The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is my personal preference for just a little more steam in my romance. Normally this author knows how to give a wonderful, beautifully rich story that literally can put an ache in your heart but still give a little steam. However, there is still no one with whom I can compare to the lushness of her writing."
5,Hallmark,This story was made into a movie by Hallmark Entertainment...Rachel is played by Naomi Watts and Johnny by Tim Daly. I thought the movie did a pretty fair adaptation of the book which is an outstanding read!
4,The Outsider,"A great book; each time you set it down it beckons you to pick it up again, and you do. I rated it four stars, you have no 4.5, because I was disappointed in the way it ended. It felt like the author was trying too hard to find a Cinderella closure and it was a little far-fetched."
1,This is a bit too plagiaristic for my liking,"Penelope Williamson takes credit for this book? In my opinion, the only Penelope that should get a nod is Penelope Worth; she was the original name of the Quaker girl Gail Russell played in ""Angel and the Badman"", of which this is an unabashed copy. The story setup is the same: near-death gunslinger nursed back to health by the beautiful Quaker girl. Gunslinger has epiphany regarding peace and the ""plain folk"" and fights internally with the conflict till the end. Both play give-and-take.At least ""Witness"" tried to spin it differently, not the case here.I think Penelope Williamson ought to thank James Edward Grant for being the original author on this one.Or at least add his name to the cover."
3,Cheapest Diapers out there!,"I was lured in by the wetness indictor on these diapers (available outside the USA). Unfortunately, the wetness indicator does not work (only because the indicator is light yellow and only visible in direct sunlight). But I ended up with 208 of the cheapest diapers on the market. My daughter is walking and pooping solid, so these work fine for us. Babies with ""soupy-poopies"" and crawlers might need to spend more for better elastic.I love that the diapers do not have copyrighted cartoon characters on them."
2,"Not so great, leaked each time","These diapers are extremely thin, therefore the absorbency is very poor. My baby soaked himself on these each time. You can imagine the hassle of changing his clothes and bathing after each use. IT cost me more than the savings. It is worth to pay one cent more per diaper for luvs or something premium. I gave it two stars because they feel soft, quantity, shipping, and I was able to return them."
2,Diaper does not stay fastened,Diapers do not stay fastened and are always coming off. Also do not absorb as much as other diapers I have used.
5,PrintShop,I love this product. I use it DAILY in my second grade classroom. The banner program is amazing and brings content to life.
3,So-so,"I thought this book was a fair, mediocre overview of different Bible versions, although I would strongly hesitate to call it a ""complete guide."" It doesn't really go into depth; so if you are looking for a mere skim over different English Bible versions, it may be alright. However, for a more in depth study of the different English Bible versions, I would rather refer to and recommend Jack P. Lewis' The English Bible: From the KJV to the NIV."
3,Good Easy Read,Very good examples of how to fill out standard forms. A bit dated on latest IRS policy concerning poker as a business. Reader must consult IRS POSTTN-139898-08 which clearly eliminates the prior abiguity in this area. Nevertheless book is a valuable asset.
4,very helpful,The book was very informative and helpful. It was an easy read and certainly will help me in preparing my taxes for this year.
5,Successful Self-Publishers Share Useful Tips,"The main part of this book consists of stories by fourteen successful self-publishers. They include a couple who writes cookbooks, a single mom who creates books for school parties, a teacher who started by publishing in her spare time, and others. Even though the books may not be the kind you intend to write and sell, you can get plenty of tips from those who have gone before you. The publishers are frank, talking about the problems as well as the joys of self publishing.Before getting to the publishers, Thomas starts with a chapter outling the commitments of self-publishing, including both time and money, and how long you can expect it to take before you become self-supporting.Honest, as well as inspiring, I recommend this book to those who are either dreaming of self-publishing, or those with some experience, but who want to become more successful."
3,"Not really a ""learn how"" book","If you are considering self publiching then this is a nice book to have, especially if you are a fan of real life stories. The 14 author/publishers all tell their stories without hype. Most took a very long time to receive a return on their investment and explain but also show that after years they are now all getting paid regularly without having to do an awful lot. I like that the book is realistic in this sense.Certainly, there are a few tips and pointers throughout but this really isn't a ""how to"" book. It is a collection of real life stories that you may be able to pick some pearls of wisdom from."
4,Bottom line,"Suzanne Thomas succeeds in bringing together fourteen success stories at genuine self-publishing. One definition of self-publishing includes the use of a subsidy or a print-on-demand publisher to launch your book instead of turning your manuscript over to a traditional, commercial publisher. However, Thomas uses the term to mean a situation in which the writer does absolutely everything including typesetting, cover design, book design, acquiring ISBN, bar code, all promotion and publicity, etc.This only makes it that much more amazing that these individuals were able to succeed and earn varying amounts of profit from their venture. A writer who wishes to go this route could glean many points---both dos and don'ts by reading these accounts. However, the book is not essentially a how-to volume for self-publishing authors. A good and inspiring read."
1,pep talk by a self-publisher,"This book lacks the details of publishing. No how-tos, no business aspects of publishing, or what to publish. It's a compilation of talks with minor writers.And as you guess, the author herself is a self-publisher.Better read ""Complete Guide to Self Publishing"" by Tom Ross and Marilyn Ross. You get much more with less money.Technical note: For those who are not familiar with publishing industry, books without discount at Amazon are usually not commercially worth to publish. They include small quanity and self-published books. Commercially worth means publisher can commit because they think they can sell minimum print run of 3,000 copies which is industry standard."
5,Unexpected inspiration,"When I began reading MAKE MONEY SELF-PUBLISHING I assumed it would be informative--and it is. I didn't expect it would be so inspiring, however. Every self-publisher included in this book is generous in sharing their lessons, ups and downs, and marketing methods. Suzanne P. Thomas has gathered a fascinating and diverse group and every story is wildly encouraging. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's been toying with the notion of independent publishing. It will have you applying for your ISBN before you reach the great resource section at the back of the book."
1,Next To Impossible To Use,"The manner in which Barish chose to organize her book makes it nearly impossible to use. It is arranged alphabetically by city, regardless of county. When searching for dog-friendly locations within a particular area, it is necessary to know the names of all the surrounding cities. Unless you have a map in front of you while using Barish's book, it is frustrating and virtually useless. In addition, the information in the book is scanty and many times inaccurate. I cannot recommend this book. In fact, I cannot in all good conscience even re-sell the book to an unsuspecting dog lover."
4,Return to college days!,"It is nearly 50 years since I graduated from college and the pen I had used all through high school and college was lost. Though I have had many fountain pens since (including a Mont Blanc), none compared to my Parker 51.I thought it might just have been memory making that pen seem so wonderful but, mira mirabilis, Parker has reintroduced the same model and it is wonderful! As good as I remember.I didn't give it 5 stars because it doesn't come with the original ""bladder"" refill feature; it has a disposable cartridge type which can be refilled but it isn't as good as the original.Caution: Do not carry this or any other fountain pen on an airplane. I have a pink silk suit that was ruined from the pressure on the fountain pen's ""bladder""."
3,Square Pink Coral Posts,"Absolutely loved 'em, until the second time I wore them, the post broke off. I now attach it with an old earring back."
2,I wanted to hear from Jim,"I know Wingardner, and I know his road trip buddy, Jim. Trust me, Jim would have written a MUCH better story. Wingardner's prose is flat, his tone is at once snide and ""gosh golly gee whiz,"" and he scripts himself as the hero in nearlly every chapter. I agree with the first reviewer that ""Elvis Presley Boulevard"" is more ""Me, Glorious Me,"" which is a shame, given the potential richness of the material. Jim sent me a postcard of a fur-bearing trout from this trip, and the message on the back had more drama, wit and affection for the subject than this whole book."
1,"Jim? Hell, I wanted to hear from Akers.","I guess all the refugee's of Miami U./ Oxford's ""Monday Night Smoking and Drinking"" from the early 80's are commenting here.I knew Mark, I knew Jim, I knew Akers. I forget who's idea the trip was, but Akers was supposed to go before she had something come up. Some sort of poetry emergency. Anyway, Jim was/is a better writer than Mark, Akers was better than both, and doing a book about it was her idea. That's the way I remember it and I am bigger than any 2 of them.The best thing I can say about Winegardner is that as a writer and original thinker he was very good looking."
2,"Philosophical Essays, Not So Much TV","This is more an academic book about politics and the role of the executive office. It's only marginally about the TV show and not at all about the actors, behind the scenes, etc. Plus it only deals with the first couple of seasons. Not light reading in the least."
5,The book really captured the essence of the brilliance of Aaron Sorkin,I was wondering did the authors ever think of doing a complete breakdown of every episode from 1to7 with guest Star credits and behind the scenes stories and breakdown of plotlines.I would love to read how the actors dealt with John Spencers Death and Leo respectively.I would love to see pictures from behind the scenes like a day of shooting and a tour of the set pictorially speaking.
4,it works and its cheap,I bought this check valve for my 500 gl. pond that has a waterfall feature. What can I say but it's cheaper than Home Depot and it works great. Check it...the valve.
3,It had to be JoJo,The packaging of the non-Amazon seller item was a bit dinged up. The little girl it was for is in her JoJo phase so I had to buy it for her JoJo themed birthday party. She was pleased. She didn't care about the box in came in. I was disappointed because when I shop at the store I usually pull from the back of the pile to be sure I get the newest (non-dinged) box.
4,Les Miserables for the masses,"While it is true that there is deviations from Hugo's immortal work, I believe that up until the ending (which falls short of the mark), the story line is true to the novel. My point is simply this: any novel converted to a movie must be edited. Any judgements to be made by those who know the source should take into account the motivations of the characters and the major details of the story, not wory if all 1463 pages were covered. I was moved by Jean Valjean's motivations to protect Cosette, to hide from Javert and project the godliness of the Bishop to all his actions. Liam Neeson is true to the character and Geoffrey Rush plays Javert par excellence. The character of Thenardier wasn't evil enough, however he was omitted from the second half of the story, where his evil and cunning are truly developed in the Novel. Cosette's character was a bit modernized and liberated too much."
2,Long and boring,"THE BROADWAY PREFORMANCE IS MUCH,MUCH BETTER! Bille August did all he could to make ""Les Miserables"" a good movie, but, alas, the director did not achieve this. Neeson and Rush played pretty well as Valjean and Javert, but they could not pull off the magic of the Broadway show. The movie was long, boring,and a disgrace to the show! IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE,YOU'LL LOVE THE BROADWAY PLAY!"
3,Where's Eponine?,"I absolutely love the musical version of Les Miserables not to mention the book so I thought I would give the movie a view. Now, I will admit that I am standing at a totally biased point of view because I am an avid musical fan and in so, I had some expectations for this cinematic drama. It is wrong on my part to assume so much in the film but I can't help but be disappointed. I thought the movie took away some of the best characters and story lines. I also thought that the progress of the movie was rather awkward. It was a nice attempt to smoothly blend Jean Valjean's conscience and get-away from Javert and Cosette & Marius but it ended up being rushed and confusing. But with that aside, I think on some levels the movie does the book justice as the casting is quite good. If you like Les Mis, be it the musical and/or the book, then this movie is a decent way to kill some time. Disappointment may ensue but it won't traumatize you."
1,Terrible.,"This movie left out a lot of important aspects of the Hugo classic,like EPONINE and the fact that Marius & Cosette would never have met if it weren't for EPONINE.And the Thenardiers are only in one scene.....I say this movie disgraces the book."
1,Terrible Interpretation of the Story,"I agree that actors and actresses were good, however, they way the story was interpreted is way off the original idea of the book. If you like this book, don't watch this movie, it will drive you nuts when you saw Valjean beat up the bishop when stealing the lamp; you will be upset to find out Marius turns out a street rat; and many many more. I would suggest you to find the French version of this novel, both the old version (which is the best) and the Jean-Paul Belmondo's new ""Les Miserable"": I would rate the former 5 stars and later 4.5 stars.The later one use World War II France as the background of the story to demonstrate the universal truth of Hugo's ""Les Miserable"". You won't regret by watching it."
5,Great Story and Wonderful Film,I highly recommend this to anyone who is unfamiliar with the story. I would suggest this version to anyone who hasn't seen this musical (Broadway or the newest motion picture) or read the book as necessary background material. The cast is top-notch. Very enjoyable!
5,Love it!,"This movie had good actors. Everything was done well. I loved it! The girl was pretty annoying, ungrateful and hard-headed though. Glad it ended as well as it did though."
5,"Excellent movie, excellent video quality",I love this movie. The acting is very well done. The story is very inspiring. The video quality was just like a DVD.
3,Action but where's the meaning?,"If you are com[paring this to the 2012 version, I think you will find that this versions's ending is a disappointment. Otherwise it's most enjoyable but not as wonderful as the 2012 version and not as clearl in its message of the poor in revolt against the ruling class."
3,Les Miserable,"I have seen the live onstage production of Les Mis. and absolutely loved it. This movie version is ok, but I am partial to the musical movie version as the musical scores lend a much more depth to the emotions of the whole story line. This version with Liam Neeson and Uma Thermon strays from the original and I simply think that what was left out from the character of Eponine, and how this version ends with Valjaun left a whole dimension out at the end."
1,This is not Les Miserables,"is this Victor Hugo's story? absolutly not. this only a ordinary hollywood movie, you really really really need to read the novel or watch the older version movie, if you want to know what a great story it is."
1,hmmmmm,"had the director / scriptwriter actually read the book?i think not.not a bad film, but it just bears no resmblance to the book. and the book, being one of the finest pieces of literature i can think of, deserved a film that could do it justice.good cast, good acting, and mmmmm was marius cute, but a wasted oppurtunity."
4,Wonderful..but still missing something.,"I am in grade eight, and I had the chance to choose a book of any lenght last year to do a book report on and I chose Les Miserables. I love it!! There are so many sub-plots and little things to pay attention to. I like that.THe movie,also, is a wonderful piece, but the screen writers left out a very important character,Eponine. I also think if, like the others, that if a movie as cheesy as Titanic can be three hours long, surely a piece of wonderful literature could be as long or at least longer and having a better ending. But inspite of all this, I myself believe that the acting was superb and the characters all seemed to be true and real. It could have been better, but it still was a WONDERFUL movie. Beth J."
2,Miserable Les Miserables,"I guess I would have thought of this movie as fair enough had I not both read the book and seen the musical in advance. Having done both, however, I was very disapointed with this version of Victor Hugo's great tale of the French Revolution.Although Bille August is a great director, this movie is much too typical of Hollywood to be very interesting. Eponine is written out of the story(!). The whole political message (of quite a historical importance) has had to give way for a clishé love-story.Compared to the Marius in the book and in the musical, this Marius seems stupid and superficial.My advice is: Do not buy/rent this movie if you have read the book or seen the musical. It will bore and disapoint you."
3,"Where's the Music, where's the GRACE?","While very well done, I found myself wondering why this film was produced, falling as it does, so far short of the revelation of grace that saturates the Musical. It serves to make anyone who has seen both versions, appreciate the spirit behind the words and the music of the Musical. By comparison, the musical version can only be described as ""Amazing Grace!"""
4,Good...but different,"Les Miserables is an extremely long book and it is very hard to make it accurate to the true story. I've seen a lot of movie versions of the story and this has to be one of my favorite adaptations. It obvousily doesn't hold a candle to the muscical, but what does?Liam Neeson does a superb job as Valjean. He by far was the best Valjean I've seen on screen. Goeffery Rush was equally good as police inspector Javert And Uma Thurman played a very good Fantine. Claire Danes did a good job as Cossette, but she often annoyed me. I was pretty upset that they completely forgot about Eponnine(who is one of my fav characters) because she puts a little more intrest in Cosette and Mauris's relationship.one of the biggest reasons i liked this was cause not everything was like the book and it had a couple of changes that i liked. The ending was pretty bad, but what can ya do?Overall, a pretty good movie, but i would beware if ur a purist."
3,"It's good, but it could have been better.","If you've seen the play or read the book first, you'll be disappointed. It's a good movie, but not as good as it could have been."
3,"Okay, but it's missing something.","I saw this movie, and I thought it was okay, but it was lacking something. I think the musical explained more than the movie. I mean, Enjoras in the musical was , like, the leader. In the movie, he shrank back while Marius handled the revolution. And Eponine! Where was she? I didn't even see her! She's supposed to like Marius, but I didn't know who was her. She is my favorite character! And I didn't even see her! Somebody didn't even read half of Les Miserables. And I didn't know that Jean Valjean was supposed to fall in love with Fantine! I think he should have just liked her as a friend."
4,Close to real story,I like that they went into detail about the convent but they left off a lot at the end. Liam Neeson was great as always I thought the casting was wonderful
4,Good movie!,"I love Liam Neeson, so I'm absolutely willing to watch ANY movie with him in it! My sister suggested that I watch this version, as it is based on the book! I still want to see the one based on the musical, but this was very well done indeed!"
1,"1935's ""Les Miserables"" still remains unbettered!","It may seem ridiculous to review a movie that you haven't seen; but actually, I'm not reviewing this one at all. I'm writing this to direct the people who were disappointed with this allegedly lukewarm adaptation to the version that still trumps all others, Darryl Zanuck's 1935 triumph ""Les Miserables"". Three things above all, make this the one to see: 1.) Frederic March and Charles Laughton can act rings around Neeson and Rush; 2.) You get more for your money--1 hr and 49 mins. of impeccably distilled Hugo, rather than 2-and-a-half hours of Hollywood rigmarole; 3.) The shattering ending is filmed full power, instead of the infuriatingly compromised denouement seen here (if the other reviews here do not lie!). Please take a moment and see my review for the 1935 masterpiece! (Warning: Amazon's 1935 recording apparently is dubbed by foreign actors and subtitled back into english. [God knows why!] Demand the geniune article!)"
4,Pretty good,"Les Miserables was very good, and I would have to say the musical was better. However the movie had its strong points, namely Liam Neeson (Jean Valjean), and Geoffrey Rush (Javert). The only real thing that was lacking was that the finale wasn't as moving as in the book or the musical. Very good though."
3,Kab-h44 Les Miserables a hit,"One Of the good qualities of going to the theaters, is watching a wrenching,good performances in the movie. One of the most celebrated movies of the year. The movie itself did okey. This had some faliure in alot of parts but it still a truly masterpiece."
3,Adequate adaptation just lacks spark of musical version.,"This is some of the best acting that Uma Thurman has ever done as she carries the first half of this film giving it a true sense of the suffering of the times. Why does Claire Danes try an English accent occaionally when the movie is set in France? Unfortunately, the energy is drained out of the movie in the last half where the student revolution just doesn't have enough passion to carry through a strong climax. Of course it is near impossible to live up to the live show that eveyone is so touched with of late."
2,Victor Hugo is spinning in his grave,"The cinematography, the sets, the scenery, the costuming--all are lovely. I like all these actors.But Jean Valjean punching Monseignior Bienvenu? Unbuttoning Fantine's corsette?I feel dirty. And not in a good way. These alterations are worse than just gratuitous and titillating. They misrepresent the era. And they are contrary to the spirit and intention of the original.Victor Hugo wrote a different story altogether. It was about redemption through self-abnegation. If the screenwriters didn't like what Hugo wrote, they would have been welcome to write their own story, and call it something other than Les Miserables."
4,"Beautifully acted, One of the best movies!","True, it is not quite the book, but you must give credit to the writers and director for making such a long book into a wonderful movie which explains the finer points of the book so well! Les Miserables is a wonderful movie, and Liam Neeson and Geofferey Rush are superb in their roles! I have read the complete book, as well as watched the movie several times, both are wonderful. I do suggest watching the movie before reading the book, it will make it much easier to understand.This movie is absolutely captivating, you can't help but hate Javert, and love Jean Valjean, and wish for Marius and Cosette to fall in love. Yes, while the book goes much farther into detail, the movie captures it beautifully..."
2,This les mis is a miss,"Compared to other versions, and certainly, the musical, i don't recommend this version. Some parts are good, but i would only give it 2 stars ( maybe 2 1/2)"
1,Not for anyone who has read the book,I don't think anyone read the book! Even in the condensed version! To many main characters were omitted. The acting was fine.I just did not like the interpertation.
3,"Great in some areas, weak in others....","This is not the full story and in that sense it fails the viewer. Valjean's story ends long before his death, which is very important to the plot overall. It's a bit like watching your favorite series, starting three episodes into a pivotal season, then missing the season finale. If you want a good hour of period locations and costumes (not too pretty, historically responsible) then this is your movie. If you want to see Valjean's life play out on screen, even as much as is in the musical version, then wait for the 2013 musical movie or go see it on stage. The 25th Anniversary 02 Concert DVD gives a fuller account of Hugo's characters.Still, Liam Neeson and the supporting cast did an awesome job in their roles, especially Rush as Javert. Well played!"
5,Superb!,"Hands down one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I kept putting off seeing this, for some reason believing that because it was Les Mis it would be somehow trite. Boy was I TOTALLY mistaken. Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush put on stunning performances, the storyline (Victor Hugo) has been adapted to the silver screen masterfully- even better than the Broadway version, and the music, setting, etc. are all brilliantly composed for this incredible saga. If you rent any one film in the upcoming days or weeks, please- do yourself a favour- rent or buy this film on video or DVD- you will not be disappointed. This is a very powerful film, and sinks like an anchor right to the depths of the soul."
2,Quite disappointing,"Liam Neeson is a good actor and would have been a good Valjean if the part had been written correctly. The first half of the movie was very nice and he was a wonderful Valjean. Then, in the 2nd part of the movie, everything crashed. Cosette was spoiled and disobedient -- unlike sweet, loving, unselfish Cosette from the book. And Marius was completely and utterly NOT Marius -- they made him some sort of unattractive wimpy pop-star who tried to inspire and impress the audience, but really didn't.As a fan of the book and the musical, I'm quite disappointed. I'm looking into other versions of Les Mis and hope to be more impressed."
1,"Mr.August, please read the book first","Did you know the guy who directed this had never read the book, seen the musical or any of the other movie versions? No wonder he's having trouble with the story.I have the greatest respect for Billie August, an otherwise great director of such incredible movies as Pelle the Conqueror and ""House of the Spirits, but here he was way in over his head!"
4,Good Movie....... but......,"I've read most of the reviews here and most say it doesn't potray Hugo's themes because Enjolras or Eponine aren't in it. The main themes are there. Liam Neeson and Geoffrey rush are great. Would also be good in a lengthened version. But the one who should be recognized is Uma Thurman as Fantine. You really pitty her and she knows how to bring her character across (and it lets you forget that she played Poison Ivy in Batman and Robin.). For those of you who haven't seen the play or read the book, you'll enjoy it alot. But for you others you won't find it that good (except the first half). As a movie it is good. As an adaption.... well..... get it out from the library first."
4,"Not the book, but a splendid film","Some people are saying how horrible this movie is. I don't agree. It's definately not Hugo's novel, but I think comparing it to other movies, it is an excellent addition to your collection. I was very impressed with Uma Thurman's performance as Fantine, and Claire Danes and whoever played Marius are very cute together. :-)"
1,Disappointment,"The DVD sent is not playable for the region I reside in !!!How can an order placed in Australia be filled by despatch of a Disc which shows""check reion"" and goes no further"
4,Better then the recent musical,I enjoy Liam and his movies. This period drama was rather good and a thousand times better then the recent musical. Good story and characters.
4,EPIC STORY BY VICTOR HUGO,"I have read the book and viewed the latest musical with Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackson. I enjoyed this one (maybe first of all) with Rush, Thurman, Neeson and Danes - great actors doing a wonderful job. We know the love story and the Revolution, and this movie brings it all together in magnicient style. I recommend it and compare for yourself like I did. Terrific!"
4,Don't see why it had to be redone.,"With the exception that the famous songs were not included, it was great. Also, I didn't get the ending. The acting was amazing."
5,Les Miserables,Such a great cast and movie! Liam Neeson does great work in this film. We enjoyed the story and setting.
3,This film was very well done and well worth the time.,"I gave it a three only because it has now been outdone by the latest release as a musical with Hugh Jackman, Russell Crow and Ann Hathaway. Before the new release I would have probably given it a four."
5,Amazing!,This movie was outstanding! It was much better than the new adaption because the story was more in depth and you learned more about the characters.
1,Les Miserables Lite,"The writers of this movie obviously had no clue as to the motivations of Hugo's characters. This was clearly a poor slapping-together of charicatures. Rush's Javert comes across as a cardboard villain, with utterly no nobility or honor. This isn't the Javert Hugo created. Neeson's Valjean is better crafted, but still lacks the greatness of the character in the book. This movie also ignores the social messages of the novel and seems to lack a clear focus. And where are Enjorlas, Eponine, the Thenardiers? For a much better-acted and better conceived version that covers the same ground as this one, see the Frederic March/Charles Laughton 1935 version. The 1998 version should be forgotten"
2,"Great, if you haven't read the book.","This video is great for those who have not read the book or are not familiar with the entire story line. The video leaves so much out that is is a real disappointment to anyone who is familiar with the story line, especially to those of us who have read the book.The acting is great and the characters are great. The video would be good to see before reading the book in order to visualize better the various parts of the story that are covered in the video.To those of you who have read the book I would suggest that you rent the video if you can but don't waste the money on buying it.If you have not read the book or a synopsis of the book, then buy the video but follow it up with the book or an audio version of the book."
1,"A good movie, but a terrible adaptation!","Well, I am an ardent fan of Les Miserables. I love the book and the musical. I was prepared for it to be different, but it was horrible! I've seen it twice- once I rented it, and once in English class. They left out two of the best characters (Eponine and Enjolras). They also left out all the Amis! The only characters that weren't warped at all were Javert, the bishop and Fantine. Cosette was just a snivelling crybaby. There was no mention of the Thénardiers after Montfermeil. Gavroche looked too young, so it sounded weird to hear about his ""babies"". The third act was totally stupid. Marius is too much of a lovesick moron to lead a revolution. And there wasn't even a proper ending! Can't a misaholic get at least a little bit of sympathy? The movie made Victor Hugo spin in his grave, and the Mizzies spin in fictional character land."
3,Solid but lacks,"The leads are very good in this version, Rush and Neeson especially. The biggest problem for me was that Eponine was cut completely. I didn't like the way they did the Javert suicide scene either. Just doing the Nestea fall into the river with Valjean just standing and watching was weak. Overall, a decent film and worth watching."
5,"This is a wonderful story of hope, love and determanation!","Les Miserables is one of the best movies I've seen.It is on my top 10 list and after you review this movie it soon will be. The actors in this movie put a lot of hard work as you can see on the screen in their performences.They put their hearts and souls in becoming these characters. I have to say Geoffrey Rush did an outstanding job as Javert.He has been the only villian in which touched my heart, and made me reflect on his character. He deserves 5 stars.It's a movie you need to rent if you haven't seen it yet!So go rent it tonight!"
4,Pretty Impressive,"This was a great movie. They didn't quite follow the book...but it was good anyways. The reason I rate this only four stars is because of Marius. His make-up and acting in this film was horrible. Me and my sisters try to imitate him being annoying, like he is in the movie. We laughed our heads off. Liam Neeson did a great job playing the role of Jean Valjean. Fantine's life is miserable, as in the book. I think this is a great movie, minus Marius."
2,Les Miserables,"Expected it to be a musical and it was not. Therefore, I was disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone else."
2,Screenplay butchery,"This is a visually stunning movie but the screenplay did unpardonable things to the story. I can forgive rearranging things a bit to make it easier to film, but this changed fundamentals of the original moral message and of the basic natures of the characters.Sadly, I don't think the Richard Jordan-Anthony Perkins version is available in its entirety. It looks campy, but the screenplay was far more faithful to the spirit of the novel."
2,The film print was not of good quality,The film seemed not of good quality as it was very darkall the way through. Unable to see a good picture. Almostlike every scene took place at night.
4,Good....but where's the ending?,"I had just recently seen the musical when I first saw the movie, and it had to be one of the best plays I had ever seen. When I watched the movie, I did not expect it to be as good, but I did expect a good movie. I got the good movie, but there was no comparison to ending. It was in fact, horrible. I really like the movie, but when it got to the end I could not believe it. I sugest that you watch to movie, but don't expect to be thrilled with the ending."
2,Disappointment!,"This movie version totally misses the mark! It added lines and actions that were never in the original book, and omitted some of the most important scenes. Too much deviation from the original story. 2012 Les Miserables is more faithful to the original story and is based on the musical version of Les Miserables."
5,Exquisitly emotional flick!,"A brillianty performed movie! Liam Neeson and Geffory Rush miraculously capture their characters and their emotions. Even though I am a thirteen year old girl, I have read the Victor Hugo classic. The writers of this flick captured the detail and redemption as much as the book, and chose a fine Jean Valjean. Like another writer said, ""I will cherish this movie for many years."" As for the only viewer that gave one star, you are not able to see true emotion in what makes a movie, a very fine movie, or so I believe. As for the rest of you, you have classy taste in quality!"
2,Sonomulent Soundings,"First, let me say that after buying ""Dream Dancing II"" this CD was a disappointment. That is the one you want if you don't have any of Ray Anthony's albums. I could have done without the radio type announcer on this CD and just have had plain cuts of music. But for those before my generation (and I'm a senior!) this may bring back good memories. I, however, found it annoying. Ray Anthony is great as usual and I would never slight his talent. Just him please, no vocals or announce overs! The male vocalist, Tommy Mercer, in particular is sub par (he's better when he's singing with the Skyliners. His appeal must have been for his looks and not his voice). The female voacalist, Marcie Miller is quite good. As I said, unless you are a Ray Anthony super fan and enjoy all his work, get the ""Dream Dancing II"" to start your collection and let this one go to the folks who actually danced to his music."
3,The heartbreaking loss of an aging parent,"Michael Ignatieff's 1994 novel Scar Tissue is the story of two brothers, one a neurologist and the other a philosophy professor, coming to grips with their aged mother's descent into a wasting neurological disorder (Alzheimers?). Neither philosophy or science are able to make sense of the illness, and the question ultimately becomes how the narrator and his brother are to carry on in the face of the inexplicable. This is a sensitive story, finely told."
5,A Gorgeous Tribute To Italy!,"This book is more than a well-researched travel guide. It's also the most gorgeous tribute to Italy I've ever seen. I'm an Italian, living in Como, and have visited every one of the villages in the book and I can tell you, they are as gorgeous as the authors' interpretations. The photographs are some of the most beautiful I've ever seen, and, like a previous reviewer, I, too, get misty-eyed just looking at them. If you want to travel to Italy or just love Tuscany, you won't go wrong with this book!"
1,Book was not like new,"Book was to be like new, I bought it for a Xmas gift it had some type of sticky glue all over the back cover.Kind of gross!!!"
3,"Walter Payton ""Never die easy""","I gave the autobiography of Walter Payton 3 stars because it told a lot about his life and I liked that. It gave things that he said as well as things that others said about him. I liked how they wrote the book. They didnt write it by just giving information about him, they wrote it by what others said about him and what he had to say about a bunch of differnet topics. Over all I think that it was a pretty good book because it can make people want to play football and be like he did."
2,USED book.,"I knew I was purchasing a used book, but I didn't expect the condition of the book I received. Pages were stained as if there was water/ food damage. Pages had been ""ear-marked"" and creased over. Over all the book was in less than favorable conditions. But in the end I was still able to read it and enjoyed to story. Shipping was speedy and communication about shipping was great."
2,Agreement with Smalter & 'Don't Bother' reviews,"First of all, I am not a football fan, but when I first read about him, I became a fan of Walter Payton. I feel football was the medium for his message and he sent a great message, he was a truly great man. However, I did not feel this book did him justice. He wanted his life to serve as an inspiration to young people and it did, but the book missed the boat. Unfortunately this book will soon be forgotten. I felt like I had to wade through the dross of panegyrics to find some of the nuggets of true value. Someone must be able to write a inspirational book about this inspiring man."
5,EVERYONE should read this book,"Simply put, I would recommend this to anyone. So little of it is about the NFL; so much of it is about life and how to live it. If you want an example of how to be the best at what you do and still have a human side, to be a true hero, you won't find a better one than within the pages of this book. As they say in Chicago, 'Superman doesn't wear an S on his chest; he wears number 34'."
5,Good Read and Interesting Story,"Very good read. Especially interesting were the chapters about his childhood, and dealing with life after football."
5,"Never Die Easy, a must read!","The title of this book says it all! Walter Payton lived life the best way anyone should, doing your very best at whatever you do! Walter Payton was extraordinary both off and on the football field. He is a true hero who touched many lives and leaves a great legacy behind; Walter you are still missed by all! I never met Walter and I was too young to see witness his amazing football skills but I am inspired by his personal story. Everyone should read this; it's inspirational!"
4,Good information.,My son used this on a research report he wrote on Walter Payton. He was a very interesting man. Good reading.
3,there are better books of this type out there...,"Doctor Sex is written for men, but does vindicate women at the very end! Recommended for people who like porn interlaced with religion & British politics..."
4,sex & laughter,"There is sex from cover to cover and the laughs are good. Makes you wonder just what lengths people would go to to reach a goal. Doctor sexton uses a mind machine, along with the rack to reach his. His butler is a hoot, along with being sexually aggressive. Lots of fun"
5,Meat Goats: Their History Management and Diseases,"I found this to be both easy to read and informative. Good pictures, tables and discribes problems and their solutions. Good way to get into the goat bsuiness. Don't take lightly fences they work both way, keeps them in and others out."
5,great product,spend a few dollars extra and buy these and not the cheap pans. These things are great. They are non-stick and are not flimsy. My wife has used all three pans so far for making cheescakes and she swears by these things already. She has used them in the oven up to 450 degrees and has had no problem yet.
4,Happy Baking!,"I love them!! Although, I have to admit the middle pan is 9 1/2"" instead of nine like someone mentioned before."
1,Horrible,All three were broken in less than a month. After one use they leaked and they wouldn't close correctly. It was waste of money.
5,Love it!,I love this set! I bake for a living and needed spring loaded cake pans. Plus it was shipped right away and came within two to three days! I say awesome job!
5,Absolute Escape,"Being able to lose yourself in a book, is a completely unique experience that is usually reserved for fiction. Under the Tuscan Sun, a non-fiction book absolutely does this. It reads like a novel that you cannot possibly put down.At the same time it is real - you are there using every sense that you possess.As a guest in the author's house, you sweat, your muscles ache and you get dusty as the rennovations take shape. You want to soak in a long hot bath after reading several pages.You shop side by side with her at the market, smelling, hearing, touching and tasting all that Italy has to offer.At her table you do not feel compelled to go to the fridge for a snack, but feel completely stuffed, like you have really eaten the meals she has described.What a wonderful place to lose your self, but Under the Tuscan Sun."
2,"Taste good, but not good for your health","I have used this splenda products for the last few years without knowing any side affect. After reading a few health and diet book, I decided to quit this usage and I threw them away. Now, I used Stevita Stevia and organic raw blue algave products, they are natural products and good for your health. They taste great too and highly recommended. Don't take my word, just google splenda and you will find it out. I gave this product 2 stars because the taste is fine, but not for your own health. Give yourself a better health with the above products that I recommended. Life's too precious!"
2,"THE ""STOOGES"" AREN'T LAUGHING !","Warner Home Video should be ashamed of themselves for releasing average quality prints when the technology exists to properly clean them up. ""Three Stooges"" fans might not be laughing over the video quality found in this latest DVD release once they plop it into their player. The video transfers still contain dirt, debris and scratches, too much for my liking.Meet the Baron is positively the worst of the two films. It's absolutely clear from the opening titles that no restoration went into this Warner release at all and as a Stooges fan I was completely disappointed. I've seen numerous ""Three Stooges"" shorts released in the public domain that have looked better than this in terms of quality. Five stars for the Stooges, two for this release.DVD Features:Meet the Baron theatrical trailer onlySubtitles: English, French & Spanish (feature films only)"
3,Stooge Stupidity,"Meet the Baron/Gold Raiders.A mixture of early mayhem with their then straight man Ted Healy. The main stars being Jack Pearl who was very big in radio at the time , and Jimmy Durante,following their success in Hollywood Party ,also 1933.The stooges shine in their sketches with some very bad jokes. Also supported by Edna May Oliver and Zasu Pitts. Early Fun. Gold raiders filmed at the end of their careers gives a polished performance from all, with a resonable cast and production values."
3,Stooges Movie,"I bought this Two-movie DVD mainly for the Stooges movie. It wasn't bad. A must-have for Stooges collectors. They weren't as hammy as I predicted, which was good. All the Stooges movies with Curley Joe Derita really suck, and did a disservice to the caliber of humor Curley and Shemp helped to create. This movie has Shemp as the third Stooge, and if you have seen all the Stooges episodes, as I have, you'll discover that Shemp was the funniest Stooge. This movie moved along at an entertaining pace, with many Stooges sight gags to help it along. The Durante movie sucked bigtime. Can't believe that guy made money doing lame humor. For the price of both movies, it's still a bargain."
1,Gold Raiders? I Got Raided.,"The quality of this dvd set was not up to par with the comments I have seen on here, though all but the Gold Raiders movie was average to good considering the age of the material. Gold raiders OTOH, was a complate piece of garbage. Somewhere after the 35 minute mark there was extreme pixelation; the worst I have ever seen on a dvd. It was so bad the player actually locked up, and the only way I could hope to get through it was to fast forward (hoping it wa just temporary). Consequently, I had to do that through the rest of the movie. Awful, just awful. The Gold Raider movie was the main reason I bought this set; what a waste."
1,One Movie doesn't Play,The Gold Raiders will not cue up or play no matter which player I use. Meet The Baron works fine. Would like a replacement if possible!
3,classic comedy teams in lesser known efforts,Nothing like classic comedy and the comics of yesteryear. If you enjoy the featured teams in general then you will enjoy these.The Stooges are the most uneven of the offerings with a very early Ted Healey pre-code campus comedy (sexy musical number ) & a wheesy 50's oater. Other remaining offerings are with the teams out of their element at rare outings at MGM. The A&C is prime & very good.L&H are out of their prime & MGM missing true L&H humor--still if you like them you should enjoy this box set
2,Looking for Lots of Celebrity Skin? Look Elsewhere,"Priscilla Barnes of TV's ""Three's Company"" promoted this movie, saying something like, ""I have a very daring nude lesbian scene..."" Well, she is in the movie, and she plays a lesbian, but aside from a few kisses and caresses, the ladies don't do much. If the Priscilla footage is the only reason you want to see ""Erotique,"" you will be disappointed.The movie is four sex-related short films spliced together. The first one is about a phone-sex worker, and it's kind of dumb; the next is longer and set in Latin America on board a train, and it's even worse. Then there's ""Taboo Parlor,"" starring Priscilla, and while the sex and nudity are too brief the itsy-bitsy movie itself is better than the first two. Finally, there's ""Wonton Soup,"" a movie about a Chinese couple that's really well made.But again, if Priscilla Barnes is the drawing card for you, save your money and buy a collectors' edition of 3/76 Penthouse, which features her as Pet of the Month."
1,Insufferably bad soft porn.,"Yes, it's porn. Yes, it's SOFT porn. And, yes, it is very, very bad. There are many films out there that do sex and fantasy well, tell a story, and contain ""ideas."" Try, for example, ""Lady Beware"" or even ""Crimes of Passion."" The acting and writing in Erotique is, well, wanting. The scenarios (not just the phone sex story but ALL of them) is standard stuff pilfered from the pages of Penthouse Forum circa 1977. Been there, done that, don't care. An utter waste of money and time."
1,A total tasteless video,"Very dull and boring. Nothing but a complete turn off. One or two scenes started getting spicy and while it seemed that they could produce a 'start engine' condition, they abnormally terminated, without succeeding their point even at least. As for nude scenes... A schoolchildren suitable video. I do not seek exclusively for hard-core scenes. Erotic videos can be far more arousing, if well made,(e.g:Penthouse videos) without the sole need of them. I was totally dissapointed with this one. A total waste of time and money..."
3,Leonard Maltin is an idiot,"Why does Amazon use this guy? He has nothing positive to say about anything that isn't mainstream Hollywood produced by anyone not like him. Take a chance on this one--Maltin's jaded, obviously anti-feminist point of view should not be your guide. Treut is an experimental, out of the box film maker. If you want to go by Maltin's recommendations, stick with Disney."
2,Majesty of hominism,"I thank Leonard Maltin for standing up for the majesty of hominism and LOGOS in art, which is well-practiced and annealed innovation. Unnanealèd experimentation should remain in private, and not be hideously aired like dirty laundry. Thus had Leonard, with the light of modesty, abjured this aborted endeavor with a just and measured implacability."
5,Bought for my mother....,"...she absolutely loved it.While I was growing up anytime Pepe LePew came on she sit next to me on the sofa, and we'd laugh.Wonderful memories with Mom while watching a sweet cartoon character."
5,Great cartoons in a great package,"As the other reviewers have already noted, this DVD is done right, all the classic Pepe Le Pew cartoons in their original aspect. Can a similar DVD of all the Chuck Jones Roadrunner and Coyote cartoons be far behind?My only suggestion is that these cartoons are best enjoyed one at a time. I don't recommend watching all 17 one after another. Why not add a cartoon to your evening movie, thus simulating the experience of those of us who saw these in theaters?"
5,The Retirement Catch-Up Guide is Worth the Investment,"As a professional financial adviser (CFP), I found Ms. Hoffman's insight to be very timely. These are answers to the questions that real people are asking me on a daily basis. The book is well written and will inspire many to get serious about planning for retirement. I have bought this book to give as gifts to my clients."
1,"Same Old Information, Not Organized","With retirement just 11 years off I thought I would start reading up on the subject. Hey, you can't know too much. So I've been perusing Amazon for promising titles. When I got to this one it looked like I had found a book with answers. Yikes, was I mistaken.This is a waste of time for anyone who has any kind of life. It's just a tired old retelling of information that you can get free from the Social Security department and Medicare. The rest of what you might need to know about retirement planning is far better explained in other, more general personal finance books or by seeing a financial planner."
1,Too Superficial,"The author glosses over many important steps that a book buyer would need in order to actually implement a solid retirement plan. In many other places Mrs. Hoffman words things so imprecisely that you won't be sure what she's telling you to do. For this price, I expected information that was new, clearly laid out and that could be easily followed, but I did not get any of that."
1,Why pay for tired and old advice?,Magazines like Modern Maturity and web sites geared for seniors have been telling this information for years. Advice in this book is not new or revoluationary. The stories aren't even told well. I feel duped.
1,Used and put away without cleaning?,These brushes were stiff and could not be loosened up. It was as if they had been dipped in varnish and left to dry before being put in the package. Worthless.
2,Be warned - Not as advertised,"First off, the book claims to have 101 positions. I was very disappointed to find that the bulk of them are repeats of the same thing with minor variations. The biggest turn off for me in this book was the lack of explanation of the positions and techniques. Almost all of them were one or two generalized sentences. There were many large pictures in the book which I also did not like. Having pictures is fine, but I would much rather have seen many small pictures with a simple explanation. Then if I spotted a technique I liked, there should have been an in depth explanation that followed.Overall, they just tried to cram too much into this book so they could claim ""101 positions"". To be honest, I would have been much happier if they gave me 10 positions that they taught me how to use well."
3,"Expectations not met, a whole lot of hype","I ordered this book in the spirit of fun for my boyfriend and me. We went through the book together and our consistent reaction was ""Well, we've done that; oh, we've done that, too; liked that, but been there and done that."" You probably get the picture. I can see how this book could be a turn on to get the party started but it probably isn't necessary for those with a good imagination, a decent dose of creativity, and a little bit of flexibility. The book didn't meet my expectations based on all the hype of the previous reviews I read. I guess it might be a good book for the old marrieds tired of the same missionary position the same once a month, i.e. a good spice-r-upper for the previously tired and uninspired. But if you are in a good hot and spicy relationship, I think the book will just end up being an erotic coffee table edition to shock the houseguests."
3,"Good book, good pictures, same everyday positions.","(...) Its not a bad book, and it is fun to look at with your partner. The models are good looking and the pictures so so graphic, but it is mainly all the regular positions that a sex loving couples do on a regular basis. If you are looking for something new and crazy fun to do, pass it up. But if you are looking for a book to just keep you in tune, its not bad at all."
2,Not sure why this book exists,"There are NOT 101 positions, so forget about that. And 90% of the ones depicted are nothing anyone hasn't already though of. The book features lots and lots of very softcore photos, and some very basic text. It covers most subjects you might think of, but if you think of them, you've already got all the coverage you need.Might be good for someone very inexperienced, but otherwise...forget it."
4,Just a Great All Around Book,"I bought this for the pictures but I learned ALOT more. If you like to have freaky sex, which we all do.....then this is a must own. Check out the part on sixty nine....very interesting new techniques involving beads. Can you say FUN? I knew you could!"
3,Wasn't Impressed,"Very basic information that is well known. Basic positions, basic arousal, just basic ...."
5,The Best Sex You'll Ever Have : 101 Exciting Positions for E,"This is one of the best sex positions books ever, i mean i had the biggest orgasm ever, you must get it! It'll make your sex life crazy!!"
5,Cutco Warranty is a Gem!,"We have owned Cutco steak knives, paring knives,a Chef knive, a bread knife, a carving knife set,and others for many, many years. I had never sentany of them in for their free sharpening service.The Chef knife finally got a chip on the tip, andthe special cutting edge of the steak knives waswearing down, so I decided that it was time tosend these knives in for ""repair"" and sharpening.I did have to pay shipping to send the knives there,and $8.00 to have knives shipped back. To my delight,Cutco decided the knives were worn enough to be replacedwith brand new knives. This was a total of 9 knives thatwere replaced. Cutco truly does stand by their product forlife.I have other family members who have owned Henckels knives,but Henckels didn't have the special edge that Cutco has on theirsteak knives and many others. My family now owns Cutco, and can'timagine having anything else. We are sold on Cutco!"
4,"For the love of all that is sacred, buy this book!","I give this book only four stars because Burden's art isn't always tops, but the incredibly hilarious story, for the most part, makes up for it. Better than the previous FC collection, this one features the russian James Bond, and the Carrot's mask comes off!!!"
2,As a biologist I'm insulted,"This book has left me seriously annoyed. Totally unlikable characters. The heroine came off as being especially weak willed and inept. The way the heroine goes about ogling the prince while stringing along her perfectly sweet fiancé makes her look not conflicted by like a total letch. Furthermore the premise that she's doing this all to gain back daddy's love and acceptance makes her seem extremely infantile.If you require heroines in your romance novels who you can be proud of and relate to, you won't be finding it here."
1,"cute idea, but irritating characters & choppy writing","don't let the cover description suck you in -- this author has wasted a fun premise on 354 pages of moronic schtick and undigestible characters. there's a few -- very few -- promising moments, but not worth the wade through the morass of etc."
3,"Its ok, the scent doesnt last long","Its soap.. It does the cleaning part its supposed to do.. The scent does not last very long though and is mild, but I did read this in other reviews."
3,Very Good,"Product arrived on time, but one of the bottles was leaking at the top. The other five bottle were intact."
2,disappointed - the scent isn't as strong as I hoped,"at work I go into the showers, and I smell the Old Spice body wash. only, I don't know which one. I tried this one, and it doesn't smell like it. It seems like Old Spice was more concerned with using cool blue colored body wash then getting a strong scent. I know that scents combine with different people's skin differently, and this one doesn't do much for me. I prefer my Armani Body Wash - that one leaves a sexy scent that whispers ""come here baby, you know you smelled me and you don't like it, you LOVE it!"""
1,seller sold out,i never rec'd product and seller would not respond to my emails. I rated this product one star but the truth is it would not let me rate 0. I am extremeley dissapointed in this seller. I am still waiting for my money back.
3,Could be better,"Antonio breaks out of jail and takes girlfriend Shannen on the run from the police and Shannen's family with him. The acting is flawless, and the film has some exciting moments, and I couldn't predict the ending. So why don't I give the film 5 stars? Well I feel the plot drags in parts so I don't think you can justify the price it's at now. Only buy if your a big fan of the actors or the price comes down."
3,OK for Sabato fans,"The region 1 DVD version has no additional extras to the VHS one described. Good to see an earlier effort of Antonio's though. The plot does drag on slightly and having the same family move house twice within six months seems a bit far fetched. The only reason I was saw this movie for a second time was that it was due for UK transmission by BBC on Monday 24 March, then was postponed to Friday 4 April due to Iraq news. This transmission has also been postponed giving no further air date. Save your money and look out for the show on BBC1 listings in UK. Around 23.30 to 01.00 has been the previous attempted start times."
3,RENT on karaeoke?,"I guess I like the concept being a Filipina hailing an avid karaeoke family, but it does seem a little commercial to me. It would be a good compilation except that it's missing ""Light My Candle."" It's a great buy if you're an avid RENT fan, but if you're new to the RENT phenom, start with something else."
1,nope... not worth it,"This CD is an utter dissapointment, and definitely not worth the money I paid for it. I played it once, and was horrified at the ""cast"" and unhappy with the orchestrations. What's more, leaving off 'Light My Candle', 'Tango Maureen' was truly a stupid idea.Do yourself a favour, keep looking and find the other Karaoke CD... it's hard to locate (indeed, I am still trying) but it is much better than this. It's even more expensive, but truly... worth it."
2,Not worth it,"This product really isn't worth the money. If you want the RENT music without the lyrics, a cheaper and more efficient way would be to purchase the sheet music."
1,I love Rent but this Karaoke CD is a waste of money...,"I'm madly in love with the music of Rent. Being a singer, I wanted the Karaoke immediately and purchased this CD. What a waste of money. Terrible musical renditions - Hokey is a great way of describing this CD. Save your money and get a different version if you can find it."
2,no lyrics,I was disapointed because their are no lyrics printed or on-screen lyrics. I love Rent and know all the words but I wanted to be able to bring this CD to the bar and sing. Without the words I'm afraid my nerves will make me forget them.
2,It was just ok,"I am sorry but I did not care for this novel. I think part of the problem is that I do not care for mysteries that much and I do not really like murder mysteries much better. It is much too dark what with all the suicide and drinking and I thought that much was left unsaid. For one thing, Sweeney alludes to herself as a drinker when Jack asks to begin a relationship with her. I did not really get that she was that much of a drinker in the novel so that threw me. I needed a better explanation for her referring to herself as a drinker. Also I do not like suicides - Sweeney's father and Quinn's wife. The suicides and the characters in the book are just too serious for me. Also I am still trying to determine how Brad has Charles Putnam's DNA when Belinda had an illegitimate child. There was just not enough rationale or answers for me and it was just too dark."
4,Mini-stepper,"I received my mini-stepper promptly, which was nice. It was packaged well, but had apparently been opened before being repackaged for shipping. I thought all parts were included until I read the two pages of ""instructions."" Most of the two pages were obviously written by someone unfamiliar with my language. However, on the second page there was a very clear statement to ""Please read the attached manual thoroughly before use."" When I requested a copy of the ""manual"" which was not attached or included with my mini-stepper, the company promptly sent the same two pages twice. As of July 17th, I'm still waiting for the ""manual"" to arrive."
5,Brilliantine,I like the product and have used it for a long time but could you tell what i paid for each jar and if I will be able to get it in the future
4,"Quirky, thought-provoking and enjoyable","I found this book by accident and bought it for a dollar (just luck; try Amazon). I have to say I found it fascinating. I have mixed views on religion but very definite views on quacks and hypocrites in religion, and I like the way the author addressed this in the book. I like the way the book skips around; you have to stick with it, but eventually it comes together (think a less complex version of ""A Rose for Emily."" I appreciate authors who aren't afraid to address alternate or controversial issues and modes of thought, especially in a young adult book and especially on a subject as touchy as religion. Definitely worth a look."
1,Two thumbs DOWN,"This book deserves a point for an original idea, but that was the only thing it had going for it. The author might have been trying to make some sort of point by skipping from one scene to the next with no warning, but all it came off was a confusing plot that made little or no sense. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
5,Gorgeous bowl.,I have several pieces of Wilton Armetale. It is oven and dishwasher safe. Gorgeous design and looks so pretty on my holiday table.
5,This book is UN-PUT-DOWN-ABLE,"The best thing about this book is that it is written with an impeccable style that makes it easy and fascinating to read. In fact, if you are interested in innovation, pioneeering and market leadership, this book is UN-PUT-DOWN-ABLE! The amount of research that must have gone into compiling insightful commentaries on leading organizations in different industries amazed me, and interesting conclusions drawn from these observations kept me reading on till the very end.I am currently doing research in these areas and find this book full of new ideas that stimulate rethinking of traditional truisms on innovation prediction and management. I highly recommend this book!"
4,There Once Was a Lover - Dixie Browning,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERNEITHER RHYME NOR REASONJoelle Middleton was constitutionally incapable of making waves. She was painfully shy. Her social life consisted of confiding to Ivan, her pet lovebird, and reading Clayton Abbott's witty limericks and insightful editorials. Though she'd never met the man, she'd been hopelessly in love with him for years.Then disaster struck. Her slave-driving boss was waging war on Clayton's paper, and Joelle found herself the unwilling go-between. Meeting Clay was not in her plans. She was in love with his mind -- his body she could do without... or so she thought, until she faced the most dangerously attractive man she'd ever encountered."
3,wow....,"Shinya Tsukamoto has definitely matured a great deal since Tetsuo. This is one of those movies that have a few really incredible moments and some not so interesting, slow moving parts. The 'good parts' of this film are very, very good though. The violence is very over the top and the makeup is quite grotesque. I find that the makeup in Asian films, although not as flawless as Hollywood makeup, is always tough to take. After a character endures a brutal beating (in this film the aforementioned beatings are sometimes self afflicted) their face is covered in blood and various horrible contusions, bruises, etc. While not an incredible movie throughout the climax, which is made up of a montage between the three main characters, is incredible. I'm not really sure who to recommend this movie to since it's not very similar to Tsukamoto's earlier efforts. It's one of those very original, very cool movies that you won't want to buy but will be very happy you experienced it."
3,great defense moves however,Although I found his moves great I couldn't help but be distracted by the people surrounding him. For this dvd to work best you need a partner and as far as cardio with the defense moves it didn't really work for me.
3,2nd Wind Sessions runs out of breath,"2nd Wind is not Todd Rundgren's biggest selling album, but the music from that album is creative and provocative. Performed and recorded on stage, this is not a live album, but a recording session with a live audience present. The audience was instructed not to give their applause until a signal was given.As excited as I was to view this video, I was somewhat disappointed with the mere tidbits of songs that this video provides - some 30-60 seconds or so for each song. Don't get me wrong, there are some fine moments from this session. But the purpose of this video isn't to provide the viewer with another concert video, but to allow the viewer a sneak peek at a whole new concept by creating a studio recording in front of the live audience. With anyone else, it wouldn't have come off as well as it does here, but without the full performance, it still leaves you wishing you'd seen the rest."
5,"Wonderful, read-out-loud, kid-friendly","""Jelly Belly"" is a book of modern nursery rhymes, along with some very wonderful illustrations. The rhymes generally have a great read-aloud rhythm, and are variously funny, tender, surprising. My daughter loves them and so do I. She's 2 now, and I'm sure this book would have appealed to her much earlier, and will continue to appeal for years."
2,"good for taking pics, bad for recording video","With this camera, I think, you can take good quality pics but there is something wrong about recording video. Because, when you watch videos recorded by W55, you hear a very annoying sound like a machine is working inside the camera..I returned my camera to Amazon two days after I received.."
2,Was not impressed!!,"My parents bought my little sister a digital camera for her birthday. I borrowed it and was so impressed with the pictures it took, I immediately wanted one of my own. Ignoring my gut feelings, I bought this camera instead of the one that she had - an Olympus Stylus FE-230. I was immediately disappointed by the pictures it took. They all seemed grainy and BLURRY. No matter how hard I tried, or how much I tinkered with the settings, 80% of the pictures were horribly blurry. I had to work hard to brace my arms and hands to get a decent picture. I took it back the very next day and got the Olympus Stylus FE-230, which I am extremely happy with. If you think you're going to have any trouble keeping your hands still, I would NOT recommend this camera."
5,perfect!,"this was a perfect size, color and shape for me.it takes great pictures and videos and i learn something new everyday about how to use it since am not good with reading directions.the buttons take time to get used to since their small but thats not a big deal.this is my first camera and am having a great experience."
5,sony cybershot 7.2mp,"This camera is fantastic. More than I could have expected. Picture quality is great. It has a lot of settings and capabilities, but does not leave you confused. I would recommend it to everyone!"
4,Digital Camera Sony Cybershot DSCW55 7.2MP,"I've had a wonderful experience with this camera, now I can have my own photo album with high quality pictures and great resolution, it's definitely a ""must have it"" product for anyone."
3,Good while it lasted,"I am a casual camera user. I do not think I take the BEST care of my electronics, but I am pretty sure this camera did this on it's own. I notice that other users online have complained about the same problem: The lens goes in and out, and says that it needs to be turned off. I have had it 3 years, but it was not used often, so just be prepared for this to happen (other people online said it has happened as early as 18 months)"
3,Works well for about 10 months,"We went on several vacations last year and took thousands of pictures. After about 10 months some of the features stopped working, the settings would jump around on their own and there was a long lag time between shots. We replaced the memory card, but the lag time remained. Overall, it worked well during the 10 months, but would recommend a service warranty if you are going to use it a lot."
5,Great little camera,"This is a great camera for the money. The pictures are clear and it takes great video too. Nice features. Doesn't have the ""Steady Shot"" like the DSCW80 but we haven't missed it. Don't forget you will have to buy a memory stick for this if you want to take more than a few pictures before downloading to your computer."
3,So noisy you can almost hear it,"I have owned several Sony cameras, and this is the first one to disappoint me. This was purchased to replace a Sony T7 that was lost. The camera is a convenient size, the video quality is pretty good, but the noise is far more than I would expect from a Sony. I have a Sony camera that records on CD, and it takes amazingly noise free photos at even extended shutter speeds (several seconds). That camera processes out the noise on longer exposures. This camera has huge amounts of noise above the 200 ISO, in certain colors. Unfortunately, skin tone is one of those colors, and any shots taken indoors at a high enough ISO to avoid flash will make your subjects look like they are wearing coats of many colors. The noise can be reduced by processing, but then all detail is lost. Sorry Sony, I had hoped for more. I can't recommend the camera, as I now wish I had spent more money to get a more useful camera for real world photography."
5,Great Camera!,"I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this camera. It's everything it claims to be and, from my perspective, it's a great camera for the price. The battery life is just as good as everyone raves about. I still might buy another battery just so I can run it completely dead and not have to worry about when that happens (like in the middle of my 2-year-old's birthday party)."
4,Great Camera!!! Highly recommend!,"I love this camera. The color is great, so fun and makes me feel unique. The screen is a great size, and it takes great pictures. Good with the red eye issue. The menu is great too, when you scroll thru things, it tells you what it does so you don't have to memorize it all. Takes fast pictures, but not one after another, like I was hoping. But it does open fast. Don't be fooled by the big memory, you will still need a larger card. Depending on the size pic you want, you can take about 30 to 50 pics on the memory alone. But all in all I love this camera and it was a great buy!"
5,Great little camera,"I was looking for a small digital camera that would take movies with sound, and I am very glad that I chose this one. The picture clarity and depth of field are very, very good. For such a small lens, it's really amazing. You have to download the pics to your computer to see the image quality, which is generally extremely well exposed, with details in the darks and letting some of the highlights burn out just like you used a spot meter to set the exposure. The only challenge is that it doesn't always focus well in the bar when you're half drunk taking pictures of your friends. Not sure if that's the camera or the beer. But this thing is really smart, about the size of a pack of cigarettes, and doesn't weigh much more. The battery absolutely lasts forever if you're only taking photos. If you take video, the sound is a bit challenged if you are, again, drunk in the bar recording the band. Oh well. Works great just about anywhere else."
5,"Great little camera, easy to use, love the color !!",I previously have the Sony Cyber Shot with 4.1 mega-pixels and am very happy with this one. It is less bulky and more features than my previous camera. I find this camera extremely easy to use and the pictures look great.
4,excellent basic digital camera. Very Stylish too!,"I bought this Sony Cybershot digital camera for one of the employees in my office. The camera is very easy to use, very stylish and just about all the camera you will need at a very affordable price. The pictures were crisp and colorful and the setup and use was very simple. This is a decent camera at a affordable price. Sony is a good name so you really can't go wrong with this one."
4,Great Buy,Value for money. Infact the results are as good as any other expensive sony cybershot camera.
4,"Great pictures, almost toy-like though.",This camera takes great pictures and awesome macros. However it is very small and I feel like it's going to break whenever I use it. Very fragile.
4,Great camera overall,Great little camera for the price. Some of the controls are hard to use if you have big fingers. Arrows for inserting the memory card and battery properly are hard to see.We love it so far and have taken several hundred pictures that we are happy with. Only had it about a month now.
4,review,"Great camera, but with the output port being on the bottom, even with a tripod, you cannot view the picture about to be taken on a tv screen because it is impossible to plug it in. So you have to view through the small screen to see the approximate area you want to take a picture using timer function and hope you got everything centered the way you want it.Really stupid place for the output port. They should have at least moved the battery compartment closer to the middle and made the output port on the far side of the bottom of the camera so you could view the picture to be taken on a tv set before actually taking it.I really did not like this part of the camera. All the basic functions seem to be ok, though."
1,Lens got stuck had to return,"I bought this camera and loved the look of it, the feel of it, the photos, the size . . . all until, within 2 weeks of buying it and without anything at all happening to the camera to provoke this problem, the lens stopped opening. I would turn on the camera, it would start up but the lens cover would not open. I would turn it off and turn it on again and it would sometimes open the second time and sometimes not. I loved the camera so much I thought I'd give it a day to ""sort itself out,"" but it just got worse. So, I'm sending it back and going to try to find a suitable replacement for what the camera was before it broke."
2,So so...,hi.. i bought the european version of this... the w85.... but i see they are both the same... i want to just say that i was disappointed by the image noise at any level... not like my previous w5 of such a great image quality... so even in daylight i'd see noise with this w85/w55.. i guess it's ok for the ones who just want to take a picture and keep a souvenir...
5,A great digital camera,"I've had this camera for 10 months now, and it is one of the best things I've bought. The pictures are great, no red eye. Time lag is good, especially since I have a 3 month old baby. I'd recommend a 2G memory,especially for taking a few videos. The colour pink is my favourite.I keep getting compliments form friends who see my camera. Great buy for a good price. Strongly recommend."
3,"Great size, easy to work, really poor pictures","The reviews for this camera were great, but after a few rounds of photos, I found the Sony Cybershot DSCW55 very disapointing. The majority of the photos from this camera come out blurry. Only about 1 in 8 photos are crisp and of a quality similar to that of my old HP 707. Also, the camera changes modes with very little effort, so that when you pull it out of the case it may very well have gone from auto to ISO or even video, and you have missed the shot."
2,Battery issues,I like the camera for its design but the power is quite fickle. It will turn on occassionally and even after changing the batteries it will only turn on sometimes. That's not okay when you are trying to get candid shots. Short battery life and they do not recharge well. I plan on contacting Kodak for advice. There's nothing in the manual about power problems.
2,3 DIFFERENT MECHANICAL PROBLEMS,"I actually have a different model, the 6.0 MP version purchased 2 1/2 years ago. But it looks exactly the same, so the mechanicals are probably the same. It was a great little camera while it lasted. Great pictures and great battery life. And as far I'm concerned, 6 MP is all I (and probably most people) really need.After exactly 12 mos the rotary function switch started to act up, switching between adjacent modes unless I kept pressure on it with my finger. It got worse with time. Then I had the apparently common ""stuck lens problem""; the fix is to bang it on the table, which worked. Then, last week, the shutter button broke off while it was in my wifes purse.So I'm in the market for a new camera; it won't be another Sony."
3,A little bling may go ding,"Overall, the camera is packed with features and seems to be taking good pictures. I have found a bluish halo around white-framed shots that I need to investigate. The big fault I have with the camera is that it feels cheap and plastic! My last digital camera was a Casio Slim Shot (?) that was metal and withstood wear and tear. The Sony Cybershot is fragile, light and seemingly made of plastic which makes me wonder about the quality of the ""carl zeiss"" lens and whether it will be able to withstand living in my backpack or jacket pocket, ready for use.I dont think I would recommend this camera to everyday users and would definitely have shopped around with cameras in person before purchasing."
5,Great camera for everyday use,This is a very fine camera and is ver resonable in cost. It is 7.2 mega pixels and is very easy to use. This is my 3rd digital camera in 4 years ( I keep droping them) But this is by far the best one and it has a great night option which is wonderful. I suggest this to anyone who needs a wonderful camera.
2,No as cool as it looks,"I enjoy taking pictures. I had a Cannon Elph for years and it recently started to go so I went with the cybershot from Sony. I lved how small and sleek it was alot lighter than the elph, but after using it at a close friends wedding I wasn't happy. Alot of ""ghosts"" in pictures, everyone had redeye, the zoom wasn't good at all. If you didn't hold the camera completley still the image didn't come out well at all and after a few cocktails at a wedding it's hard to do, the delay between pressing the button and the picture taking is alot longer than any camera I have ever used, I missed alot of the events at the wedding due to this, walking down the isle, cutting the cake. Needless to say I'm sending this camera back and ordering another Cannon."
4,Good general camera,"Fun to use, easy to navigate, takes great pictures. Would highly recoment a case to keep the large display screen safe. The battery life is outstanding!"
4,Sony Cybershot Digital Camera,The Sony Cybershot is a great camera. The colors and the features are amazing. Is very easy to use. The only thing I dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button. If you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out.
4,Poorly made camera,I purchased this camera to replace a DSC-W50 which broke. I assumed I was too rough on that camera and thought I would try a new one and be more careful with it. I kept this camera in a case the whole time I had it. I used it for less than 30 pictures and after 34 days I pulled it out of the case and found the LCD cracked. I sent it to Sony and they are going to charge me $111 to fix it. I would not buy another Sony camera again.
1,Not Worth It for the Price,"Having enjoyed the camera for about a year, I learned after turning it on that the telescopic lenses started to actuate back and forth several times before being prompted to turn the camera off. This repeated itself numerous times. It turns out the lenses rings became out of tolerance and the pressure on each individual lenses triggers this action. It is not worth sending in for repair. From here on out it will be Nikon or Panasonic. The camera is well cared for and looks new. Anyone want it?"
3,Not worth the $$$,"I only bought this model because it was a gift for my daughter and she was sold on it small size and looks. There's better models available (Canon, Fujitsu) for at or less than the same price. It doesn't take a good picture at anything less than ideal conditions, it uses a proprietary battery so you can't pop in standard batteries when it goes dead. Same for the memory card, everything else I own uses SD cards except this one device. And Sony's memory cards are nearly twice as expensive as well.Pluses: it is easy to use, it does have a nice interface that I like. And when the conditions are just right, plenty of light, nothing moving too fast, etc, it can take good pictures. But typically, 1/2 the pictures are blurry and grainy."
4,"Easy to use, lots of features, very handy","Anyone looking for a point and shoot camera, this is a very good choice. I like to take pics everywhere I go, and this camera can be carried in your pocket it's so tiny. Plus it's easier to use than any other digital camera I've tried and it has all the features you would want. It takes very nice pictures of landscapes, people, and pretty much everything. The downside is that the pictures will come out blurry if you don't hold the camera completely still, and I would imagine it would be hard for someone with larger hands to opperate it since the buttons and camera itself really are very very small. Also, it's not water-proof or drop proof. The size of it makes it easy to slip out of your hands, so you have to be pretty careful, it's very delicate. Other than that, it's a nice choice at a good price. :)"
2,Great while it lasted..,"I purchased this camera in May and it worked great at first, other than the videos being a little fuzzy, and not taking very good low-light pictures. But around the end of June the shutter started not opening and closing correctly, and the battery power didn't last. Now it isn't working at all. It won't even turn on with a charged battery. Dissapointing."
3,IT is ok,On the picture the camera looks great. but i do not like plastic cover i prefer metal one. I expected more from this camera than it actually does perform.
2,Started out ok,"At first i was happy with this camera, perhaps lulled by it's good looks and small size, then I woke up and realized that half of my pictures were out of focus, even when i allowed for the beep supposedly telling me it is focused, achieved by holding the button half way momentarily before taking the picture. Now it seems there is a glitch in the menus. the other day i watched as it scrolled through all the menu settings as if I were turning the menu knob atop the camera. I wasn't.I don't think it's worth my time to send it in for repair. I'll just save for a cannon, I've read good things."
3,not that great,"bulkier than it looks, and it feels like a toy. not very solid at all, and the pics aren't that amazing either."
5,Amazing,Absolutely magnificent camera.was bought as a Christmas present and is probably the best camera anyone can find for the money.I'd recommend this camera to anyone looking for a digital camera and actually taking great pictures.
4,simple and reasonable,Since this is a sony I thought it would probably still be good even though it was at the lower end of the price range for digital camera. My expectations were proven correct. The camera worked out great and was $100 less than others I considered. Thanks. Lee
2,Horrible Pictures!!!!!,"I purchased this camera a over a year ago and it has become my enemy! I loved this camera in the beginning and now I hate it! This camera takes blurry pictures no matter the circumstance! I tried everything and even flipped through the manual several times to see if I had a setting wrong. I ended up getting so disgusted with my pictures and bought an Olympus Stylus 840. I have to say that it has been a lifesaver! My pictures have not been blurry and while using the zoom option, the pictures are still clear! I would not recommend this Sony to anyone. I would recommend the Olympus Stylus with the image stabilization and the bigger lens!!"
5,Great Camera,"I have been to the store to test out a few Sony Digital Cameras. This is the new model that just came out a month ago. I picked one up last night and it is terrific. The images are extremely clear. I was playing around last night, turned off the lights and only using my flash, I took a picture of my kitten and the picture came out as clear as day. The camera also has many settings to meet all your needs, from taking pictures outside, in the snow, or at the beach. I highly reccomend this camera and it is very easy to use."
4,"Excellent camera, just a small contra...","this camera is excellent, the pics are great but the play button is almost impossible to press, harder if you are a man and don't have nails. Everything else is simply perfect"
1,Sony is a waste of money,"I purchased this camera 6 months ago. After 5 months of use, at my daughters birthday party no less, the screen broke. I sent it back for repair and was told my warranty was void because the damage was caused by ""impact"". I know for a fact that indeed there was no misuse or impact. I believe it was faulty manufacturing and a weak screen. So here I am after only 6 months of use, without a camera. I could pay $111.00 to have it fixed, but instead I am going to purchase a good camera. A Canon. I had my Canon Powershot Elph for 7 years. That camera had been flung around, dropped, and drooled on and it still works. So, if you want a camera that lasts, and a company with good customer service, DONT BUY A SONY. Thank you for reading."
2,Extremely disapointed with this camera,This camera is beyond disapointement. I wish I could get my money back. I bought it for a trip to Europe. A majority of my pictures came out blurry (indoor lighting) or dark because it doesn't have a strong enough exposure. The shutter speed is so slow I missed a few pictures. On the flip side it takes excellent outdoor photos. Colors are crisp.
1,Don't buy the Sony Cybershot 7.2 mega pixels camera!,"I got this camera for Christmas 2008 and in less than one year the lens cover stopped opening when I turned on the camera. I had to manually tap the lens cover to make it open, and when I turned off the camera the lens cover will remain open so I had to again tap it to make it close.Most of the pictures come out blurry and grainy. The photo quality is poor. I would not recommend this camera to anyone. I hardly used it and now I wonder if I used it a lot - how many more problems would I have."
1,Nothing but problems...,"I carefully researched and compared before I bought this camera - my 1st digital. I thought it would be a good camera for the price, but boy have I been wrong. I have only had it a little over a year. 6 months after I bought it the flash stopped working properly. Sometimes the flash would be so bright you cannot see the pictures and sometimes it would be too dark. Darker than taking a picture without the flash. Sometimes it would work, but very rarely. Now, 13 months after I've had the camera the zoom function has completely stopped working. In fact, if I even try to move it - it prompts me to turn off power and turn on again.I'm just going to have to buy a new camera. What a waste of $200+!!I would not recommend this model to anyone. This is my first Sony camera and I will definitely not be buying this brand again."
2,"whoops, not what I thought","I must admit that after first purchasing this camera I thought it was a fairly good purchase, however after a recent trip to Disney World with the kids I have to express my new opinion and its not good. After our return home I attempted to print out some of our memories and found that the pictures, which looked wonderful on the viewfinder and on the computer, were of the poorest quality. We bought this camera to replace a cheap 3 mp Kodak easy shot, I wish I still had that camera. The kodak's printed shots far surpassed the Sony (both from the same printer). Needless to say we are in the market again for a new camera. Unfortunately one area you dont want to go wrong, especially with the kids, is with a camera."
4,So close to perfect !!,"Love this camera! Great pictures, features and usability. The only [huge] problem is the battery pack and not being able to use basic AA batteries. Even with buying 2 battery packs and trying to always keep one charging, we are always running out of battery power at key times, and often the backup battery is not on hand. Missed a lot of great shots that way. Would be the PERFECT camera if you could just use AA batteries."
2,Its very testy,"I got this camera in March. It's my second digital camera, I lost my first one, but had been thinking about getting a new one for awhile. I have been very disappointed with the testiness of this camera. First off, I had it as a bar and someone dropped about 5 drops of a drink on it and the zoom function refused to work. Eventually that cleared up. Then, I brought the camera to the beach and the lens would not stay open-- the camera would read ""access, please power on and power off"". Apparently you are not supposed to expose the camera to sand. My old camera was at the beach 6 times a summer and never had an issue. I took the camera to the repair shop and after a $25 estimate was told that it would take $125 to fix a $175 camera. Frustrated, I took a can of forced air and managed to clear the sand out of the lens. If I had to do it again, I would not buy this camera. I have had nothing but problems. The picture quality is a bit better, but its not the pain it has caused me."
3,"Loved it, Now Hate It","My husband bought me this same camera, but with 6.1 megapixels. I LOVED the camera. Easy to use and my pictures came out great. The problem came 18 months later when I went to turn in on and a message reading ""Access"" came on and the screen went black. I went onto the internet to see what the problem could be and there were THOUSANDS of people posting with the same exact problem. Most of their cameras were less than 2 years old too. Many had sent their cameras to Sony to fix it and Sony says it was unfixable and gave the customers no accommodations for a camera that broke with less than 2 years of use. I need to get a new camera now and I though I loved the quality of the pictures, I am afraid of getting another dud from Sony."
1,High Maintenance Camera!!!,"This camera is terrible!! It eats through batteries like you wouldn't believe and the red eye doesn't work at all!! (And yes, it's turned on!) 9 out of 10 photos need to be corrected! Total waste of money! My cheaper digital camera takes better pictures than this one!"
2,ITs OKay...,First of all the pictures do not have a high quality. I don't really care since I am just having fun with it. But what really bothers me is that the videos are super blurry. It takes a long time to focus and that's difficult to work with when you are trying to record.I wish I would have choose a better camera.
1,Never recieved the camera.,It's been over a month now. Where the heck is my camera? Purchased on 8/27 and it is now 9/27. I've decided to take serious action. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER!
1,Easy Digital Camera,a camera very versatile and easy to use with many additional tools that maximize their operation
3,Lacks important features,"This camera does take good pictures at times.HOWEVER, there is no option to add a date stamp, which is very important to me. I have two kids and won't remember when pictures were taken otherwise.It also has this annoying flash that flashes several times before the 'big' flash when it actually takes the photo. This causes whoever to have a squinty face from being blinded from the flashes. I think this was because it was set to red eye reduction but I'm pretty sure it did it even when I turned it off.I've since gotten a Polaroid i733 for $85.00 which works just as good and has more features. Save your money."
2,Not a good choice,"I am very unhappy with this camera. I have a large Nikon D50 that I use most of the time, but I wanted a little camera, something that would fit in my pocket for occasions when lugging the D50 isn't convenient. It turns out, this camera takes terrible pictures. If anyone moves a muscle in the photo, it'll come out blurred. I might take 20 pictures at an event, and I'll be lucky if 2 come out at all. If you are just doing still shots of people, up close and in really good light, then this might be a good choice. However, I've been very disappointed in the quality and the poor photos."
3,Standard Camera,"I just bought the Sony Cybershot DSCW55 camera the other day to replace my Sony Cybershot DSC-P200, purchased in January 2006, which has already been discontinued. I wanted a camera that would work with the accessories I had for the DSC-P200, namely the memory card and battery. Well I just tried to memory card and it does not fit! Battery is different also. Grr. Otherwise the camera seems fine for day to day purposes.I find digital cameras, particularly those with telescoping lenses, break easily. I purchased the third party protection plan, so I have my fingers crossed."
2,FLASH PROBLEM,"This is my second Cybershot.I have both the DSCW50 and DSCW55.The main problem of this particular model is the flash.Code 99 which is defective flash.Luckily on my first camera (DSCW50)the flash broke w/in the year of purchase,so it was fix free.But the second on (DSCW55)broke after 13 months.They were charging me $175.00 just to look at the camera.My older camera w/c is the Canon powershot A85 is still working.So I decided to switch back to Canon"
4,Cute and functional,"This is my 3rd Cybershot and it's just as good as its predecessors. I never use many of the options, but I guess it's nice knowing they're there. My main complaint is that you have to remove the battery to charge it, which is mildly inconvenient. I love the fact that it's pink and that I won't easily confuse it with others' cameras when we're hanging out with other people."
4,Very Nice,Small and compact. Big screen. Nice picture quality. Easy to use. Good for occational photographing. If it had a mode for moving objects would give it the 5 stars.
4,A Chicago Rising Star,"Chicago is a great city for jazz, and the city has produced another great musical group in The Mark Fechner Jazz Experience. This group is distinctive for its vitality, excitement and interactivity among the group members. You can easily picture the fun each of these players is having with jazz standards, uptempo latin grooves and Fechner's original title track. There isn't any of that typically ""canned"" feel that so many studio jazz recordings can get. This album feels like a live show - exciting and spontaneous. Tight sound, soaring improvizations from everyone in the group and a great blend of sax and guitar make this a really entertaining disc. ""Spain,"" Wing It"" and ""La Fiesta"" are my favorite tracks."
2,Not What I expected,"I guess I didn't read the information about this well, It was mostly anecdotes about the adventures of others, like Shakleton, not so much a how-to book. I wanted a how to book. The book was in good condition and came quickly."
3,Don't believe the fanatics,Volumes 1 & 3 have it all over this one. That other 3 star rating was right -- it obviously upset the Merritt fanatics.
3,Get the other two first,"The boxed set is terrific, but if you don't want all 3, this is clearly the one to skip. Other than ""Papa Was A Rodeo"" (a C&W parody that works [unlike, say, Merrit's punk rock parody] because of the underlying affection for the genre), there's not a great song on the disc. Plenty on the other two, though."
3,Not as good as V1 & V3,"To my ears this one is the runt of the litter. I set my CD player up to leave off about 10 songs. The problem is that there are too many uninspired synthesizer songs, and too many songs about dancing (it seems like a crutch when he couldn't think up something better). Still, there are some good songs on this one, I just recommend picking it up last."
5,Pocket Style Manual: Updated with 2003 MLA Update,Thank you for a timely and good product. It is a very helpful guide and one which I have recommended to others.
1,Yet another dull contribution to the decline of contemporary,"Mr. Gordon has published another book that reads like a stereo manual, dry and ponderous, and somehow lacking at least the instructional value provided by a Sony pamphlet. While I applaud the success of a young poet, I cannot condone the willful dissemination of more boring and self-promoting poetry junk."
5,Lucy M Lewis:American Indian Potter,"This is an excellent book about one of America's greatest Indian potters with wonderful photos of her work, her home and family life at Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico. I purchased the book ""used"", but it was in pristine condition. Great deal! Love the book!"
2,"""New and Improved"" - Disappointed","I am very disappointed!!! I used to purchase this moisturizer from Whole Foods, but they stopped carrying it lately. I was happy to find it on Amazon.Although the product photo shows the original bottle, you are not going to get the item pictured, but their ""New and Improved Formula"" that smells way differently than the original. It smells like typical hotel style sample lotion, not like sandalwood anymore. Also, the scent is very weak, and the texture of the moisturizer makes your skin feel like you have a film on it and need to wash it off.Why did they mess up their product like this? I don't get it!"
2,It No Longer Smells Like Sandalwood,I bought this product years ago when it was in a glass pump container and was 3.4 ounces. I ran out of it recently and am disappointed to find that they changed the formula. It no longer smells like sandalwood. It's a pleasant smell but it's not the smell of sandalwood.
4,Great music.,"The music was great. I bought the CD. It souded super. I have seen the band, and they give a great on stage performance."
5,The BEST Christmas Album since the Carpenters,"Well...These guys are just so darn talented it is hard for me to express in words. They not only do justice to the standards BUT add three NEW songs of their own. All three AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! Very visual songs...Makes me want to go out and buy a tree in May and get a cup of hot Chocolate and decorate. best album since ""The Carpenters"" A Christmas Portrait.Dewey and Gerry ...just keep writing and recording. And I'll stay happy!!!!!!!"
3,Not bad for '70's rock.,"Gerry Buckley and Dewey Bunnell put their '70s style folk-rock vocal harmony to good use on this collection. They do recycle the 'la-las' from Horse with No Name into 'Winter Wonderland' and the rhythm track from Tin Man into 'White Christmas'. I'm not sure why they needed to do that, but at least you know what the words mean this time."
3,Partly unsatisfied,"I'm a huge America fan since I was a kid. I like the songs, that's why I bought this Christmas album. However, upon opening the package I was disappointed by the CD casing because it is not the usual hard plastic case. Its just a cardboard cover that can easily damage your CD. For the benefit of each customer, I suggest that Amazon must require any seller to inform their respective buyer about what type of casing used. Thanks!"
1,The worst criticism: Totally uninspired,"I like to pick up a couple of new holiday CDs every year, and made this one of my choices. A terrible mistake. I could tell in the first 15 seconds that it was a well produced product, but painfully uninteresting. I rather like the original America sound, but overlayed on the most banal holiday standards, well, only a friend or relative of the group could possibly give it 5 stars. I apologize if this sounds mean spirited, but ""Holiday Harmony"" is so unlistenable that I literally threw it away in the trash."
3,okay,"this book was a disappointment when i found out that it was 3.0. Most of the rules crunch is useless and overpowered, but the fluff of the book is great."
1,This is the very worst CD I've ever purchased,We are so dissapointed with this CD. It sounds a lot like the kids do when they are playing in the yard...loud and off key. What a bummer to have paid so much for it!
4,good sing-a-long disk,"I read the last negative review and had to respond. This product is not meant to sound like the movie - so I don't understand his criticism. It's meant to sound like the broadway show. Karaoke albums are for singing with, not for listening to. If the later is what you want, just get the cast album, but for kids to perform with in front of their friends and family -- this album does exactly what it's supposed to!"
5,A must buy book for new car buyers,"I never bought a car in my entire life, and I often heard that car buying is really hard. So I'd thought that educating myself before buying a car, is the first step.I find this book very detailed and straight forward, because it widens your vision all about cars. It teaches you, first about budgeting and financing, it gives you the pros and cons about buying new car or used car and also about leasing a car. It will also educate you about types of car like (sedan,coup,van.etc)One tip that is missing though is about bringing an amortization table (book) in going to the dealer.The last chapter is the best chapter, because it gives you the inside knowledge about the technique of the salesman, and how they will approach you.I can say that its the best book, because I applied all the things in it and I got a great deal with my car!"
5,Love it.,It is just what I was told it would be. It was suggested to me by someone and it filled the bill.
1,pages missing!!!,This printing (2006) has 127 pages missing from it. I bought mine last year and have just noticed it.
