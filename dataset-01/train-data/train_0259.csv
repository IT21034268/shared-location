4,An excellent 5th book in the Starbridge series,"Well written, mainly about a young man Nick Darrow who is a psychic Christian, albeit a very immature one, who blunders on to a highly dangerous situation whilst privatley investigating as to whether a fatal accident was a suicide or a getaway by the person concerned in order to start a new life"
4,"A good read, tightly written","A fascinating set of novels, with interwoven characters. The two set of novels - one in Starbridge, and the next in the city of London - are a demanding and challenging read."
1,Don't Buy This !!,We've had this item now for about 3 years - when we bought it it did'nt work very well and now it's even worse and will hardly open a can at all. Kitchen Aid made a lousy piece of equipment with this item. Makes one really wonder about the quality of their other items.
4,Nice but large can opener,"This opener is heavy duty. works great, but bulky. Probably geared more toward commercial use, but I'm sure it can open any size can. Very happy with it"
1,Can opener issues,"KitchenAid CO Can Opener Stand Mixer AttachmentOur overall experience has been bad. Shortly after we purchased the opener, we had to hold the can at a precise angle to cut the lid clear. Over the three years we have had the product, the frustration level has just increased. To my knowledge, there are no adjustments to correct the issue."
1,Piece of crap!,"I bought this thinking it would be the best thing ever, but what I have is an opener that I do not use. It does not grip well, so that it skips around the can, missing portions of the rim to open. Therefore, you will need to go around 3-4 times to get it off, if it will even open it. I now just use the hand opener that my grandmother left to me....boy they could build good stuff 30 years ago!"
1,Not worth buying,"I have now been thru two of these in three years. It is a waste of money as it has no durability. Two of these openers have failed after less than two years of use each, opening an average of 3 cans per week. When it works it is great, but after a while the mechanism deteriorates and becomes useless. KitchenAid was nice enough to replace the first one which had just gone out of warranty and now less than two years later the replacement has failed. After the first one failed I purchased the OXO Steel Can Opener (http://www.amazon.com/Oxo-58081-SteeL-Can-Opener/dp/B00004OCMM/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s;=home-garden&qid;=1222651468&sr;=8-1)to use while my wife used the KitchenAid.My OXO is going strong while the KitchenAid failed. If my OXO should ever fail, no problem, lifetime warranty; a phone call will get you a replacement.Save your money and do not buy this opener."
1,poor can opener,"I purchased this can opener and I loved it the first few times I used it, Now I hate it. It doesn't open the can completely leaving a very dangerous and sharp lid for me to pull off. I don't know if they can be sharpened, but for now it sits in a drawer. Maybe I will call Kitchenaid. As I own everthing they make."
1,Poor Quality,"We purchased this accessory based on the quality of the stand mixer. All I can say is this accessory falls far short of the mixer quality. After a few uses the opener now fails to open cans completely. I have had to resort to pliers to pry the lid off. Finally gave up and purchased a good quality hand opener. It is working fine. The accessory has been retired to the 'junk drawer'. Save you money and invest in a good quality hand opener, you won't be disappointed."
1,Piece of Junk!,"I bought this thinking it would be great to attach to my mixer, and I wouldn't have a can opener on my counter. It worked ok for a few months. Now it won't even open a can. It has a lot of power, but it just goes around and it will not cut the can. It cuts sporadically, just an opening then it skips severals sections. It will not open cans. It was a total waste of money!"
1,can opener not worth it,The can opener had to go around a can at least 5 times to partially cut thru. I still had to take a knife and slide in the cut space to pop the lid out. VERY Disappointing!!!!! Sent mine back.
1,KitchenAid Dissapointment,"Kitchen Aid is truly living only on its name recognition.This thing is a piece of junk! Expensive junk!Right out of the box, it wouldn't open a can in three passes.Don't buy one! Get a good stand alone at half the price.There is no ""zero"" star rating or I would give it that.I have used hand operated openers with roller cutting bladesfor many years and they work well and don't leave behind metal shavings.It is a shame that this design cannot be had in a stand alone electric."
1,nightmare,"i have had this product for awhile now and frankly it has been a nightmare. it does not work!!!!! in the beginning the cans fell out and never opened on the first pass. as time passed the problem became worse eventually the can do not open at all and the cans push right out or fall out while spinning, now the cans do not open at all. i went out ad bought a new hand crank. eventually i feel all of you will be this unhappy. i have had this opener for a few years and it became completely nonfunctional after 6 months."
2,Good quality but ....,"I bought it because I get it for ""free"" - special offer from Amazon - never realy use it, it is like ""unconvinient"" to use at least for my wife ;-)"
1,disappointing can opener,This was my second can opener for my Kitchen Aide. The first one worked great for 7+ years and when it started to fail I ordered another one with no hesitation. This new one is not what the older one was at all. It skips as it goes around the cans and sometimes has to make 3+ rotations to open a can. I often end up using my hand opener so I won't get annoyed with the electric one. Maybe this one is defective cause my first one was wonderful.
1,Not worth the money,"This can opener has been horrible since the beginning. It does NOT open cans easily. Sometimes the can has to go around 30 times before it is opened. We bought the can opener because Kitchen Aid usually means great quality, but not in this case. What a waste of money!!"
2,Not what I expected from KitchenAid!,I was really looking forward to getting this. But I have been very dissapointed. The cans always fall off and it rarely opens a can all the way. It is frustrating! Not worth the $40 I paid for it.
2,Kitchen aid name used to mean something,Bought this can opener attachment because I have had my kitchen aid mixer for years and have been very happy with it. I though I could not go wrong by buying the kitchen aid can opener attachment but I was wrong. It does not grasp the can properly thus creating and even cutting surface on the can. After using this attachment I still have to get out the manual can opener to finish opening the cans. I will be returning this product shortly. I am very disappointed after spending all the time to research and the money this thing cost is just seriously flawed product. Don't buy this attachment.
2,Kitchen Aid can opener won't open most cans,This can opener doesn't work well. The seller is reluctant to make it good and has stopped answering my e-mails. Watch out for Rudys deals they won't make things good if they don't work
2,No better than the next...,"I had really hoped based on some of the previous reviews this was the King of can openers. Well I have had this attachment and used it a fair bit for a year, maybe actually even two now and have to officially declare it no better then any other o.k. at best electric can opener. It really only works sometimes on some cans and usually take several revolutions just like most electric can openers. It only gets worse with time just like most electric can openers. Far too often you are left with a lid you have to open the rest of the way with a manual can opener just like most electric can openers. It sticks out of the front of the kitchen aid like an ugly sore thumb unlike most can openers.I still find a good manual can openers to be far superior to any electric option. It's funny when you think how long cans have been around and how hard it is to find an easy powered way to open any can automatically and efficiently."
2,Too cumbersome,"I bought this kitchen aid attachment for my mixer and sent it back. Although it worked fine, it was pain to attach it and remove it, just to open a can! I found that an ""under the cabinet"" can opener was my best option- much more convenient.I would not buy this appliance."
2,Kitchen Aide can opener,"Grew up with this option on my mom's Kitchen Aide mixer, worked like a charm for 30 years through 2 mixers. I expected the same from this one but it cuts unevenly, leaving spaces of lid still attached, have to put it back on the opener, cut it over and over making more passes until it finally cuts all the way around. Really miss the old quality made opener, very dissapointed. Hope Kitchen Aide will make it right. I might have just gotten a lemon."
5,Piece of junk!!,"Initially loved can opener. BUT.... Shortly out of warranty failed miserably. Kitchenaid said ""Too bad. Out of warranty"". So paid for replacement. Threw original opener away as it wouldn't open any can at all.Nine months later, the replacement won't open even the lightest can completely and if you don't hold on to the can it will fall from the opener. Kitchenaid will replace this one under the warranty. Reading through reviews on this site it appears that more than a few users have had trouble with this opener. I DEFINITELY CANNOT recommend this opener.For a Kitchenaid product, this one is a BIG disappointment!!!"
3,should last a long time,"This will open big cans with no problem, but cans where the lid is deeper away from the rim are a problem for it as the cutting will doesn't reach the lid."
3,Good & substantial... but hoping for more...,"This book is a much needed update of one of a few major reviews in the field, and has a great deal of useful content. Unfortunately for the price (and the amount of time that's passed since the last update) I was a bit disappointed - too much of it is verbatim from the previous edition, the organization is a bit weak, and the level of production is really disappointing... it looks like someone typed new headings and bound up a bunch of draft manuscripts!"
5,Great storage system...,"I looked at a lot of systems and really like this one...especially after finishing installing today...love these little s hooks...can do a lot with them as far as varing heights and diff brooms, mops, and tools too...very sturdy. Put in all masonary walls..will take a tank to pull out. Screws good..but had to provide my own anchors for masonry..thats ok I guess...easy to install...sensible and simple rack system...heavy duty..every piece snaped in place as was susposed to do...I am really happy with it..."
3,Holds without slipping!,We ordered this hook as part of the Rubbermaid FastTrack system for our garage. This item is great for holding brooms or other long-handled tools securely on the wall without slipping. This is a great system!
3,Not What I Thought It Was,"I ordered this book for my son, who is just learning to read. However, I thought it was the full length book, and it turned out to be a small board book for toddlers, and the story was shortened. My son likes it anyway, but I was disappointed to find that it wasn't the actual book."
4,The joy of feet,"""Small feet / Big feet / Here come pig feet."" With rhymes like this, you know you're in Dr. Seuss territory--in this case, in ""The Foot Book."" One of Seuss' ""Bright and Early"" books for beginner readers, this book combines extremely simple rhyming vocabulary with colorful, charming illustrations.While ""The Foot Book"" is not quite in the same league with Dr. Seuss' most imaginative and innovative works, it is still a very enjoyable book. And it contains several characteristically ""Seussian"" characters, including 6-, 8-, and 10-legged creatures that look like they stepped out of a child-friendly science fiction film. I definitely recommend this book to beginning readers, and to older fans of Dr. Seuss."
2,disappointing,Disappointingly altered from the original and not nearly as good. If you aren't familiar with the original this book might be decent but knowing the original the changes made to the text and drawings just stand out like a sore thumb. Don't waist your money on this book - buy the original instead!
2,Foot Book,I was disappointed in the size of the book. Also the contents were not as complete as the original version. My greatgranddaughters pointed out the differences to me.
3,The Foot Book a great book to read.,"The Foot Book is a great book. I love how Dr. Seuss ryhmes and just makes the book easy to read and sometimes a tongue twister if read it to fast. The pictures in this book are big, bright, and colorful which makes little kids just want to keep reading. This book kept me reading, and I really want to know how Dr. Seuss does it. He uses simple words that I wouldn't think to use such as ""fuzzy fur feet."" This is a great book, and I recomend it for little children and maybe even adults if you like childrens' books."
5,An Engaging First Dr. Seuss Book,"Snuggling with your little one and opening their first Dr. Seuss book is a rite of passage for parents, but usually before you can say Horton the Elephant your wee one has crawled or toddled off. The Foot Book to the rescue. A catchy short poem with appealing illustrations about the many kinds of feet- front feet, back feet, slow feet, quick feet- one would encounter in a Dr. Seuss world. The Foot Book is an engaging tale that will have your child humming to the rhyme and discovering the feet in his or her world. A dog-eared favorite in our home."
5,Grandpa's Favorite,This is one book our son always wanted his Dad to read to him. They both enjoyed it and is the only book my husband asks me to buy as a gift for others so I absolutely had to have one for our new great grand daughter. So glad it is printed as a chunky book.
2,The Foot Book,"This Book was listed as Hardcover when I ordered it. It came in Book Board. I payed more, as I wanted Hardcover. I could have payed much less for a Board one. They are not the same and I think this both deceiving aND DISAPPOINTING."
1,Bah.,"My niece loved it, but I'm hiding this version now that I've gotten her the *real* version. Stupid editors, changing the text, cutting stuff out, just to make a board book.Forgo this copy, just get the hardcover edition. You'll thank me later when you don't have to figure out why they forced an ""opposites"" theme on poor Dr. Seuss, or why they cut out some of the best passages."
1,NOT the book you know and love!,"This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book! They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book... What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be."
5,The Foot Book,I love this book because i always liked how they described feet in this book and how all the different kinds of feet looked. The thing is i never liked my feet so i would always say i wish i had feet like that even though they werent even that different. I love rhyming books and this one is one of my favorite ones.Alyssa Seifferly
5,The Foot Book,"The Foot Book By Dr. Seuss is about feet...there everywhere!! Its a great book for all ages!! The Book Makes learning your right foot from your left foot a fun experience. The Foot Book is guarentee to leave you ryming in you head all day long ""left foot left foot left foot right!"" I would highly recremend this book for people 2 years old to people 102 years old =)!!"
5,A Classic,"""Slow feet/Quick feet/Well feet/Sick feet.""Whatever kind of feet you are looking for Dr. Suess' The Foot Book has them. It is a great book that every kid will love and adore.I am now 17 and can still recite word for word some of the golden phrases out of that book. The book has catchy phrases comparing opposites. It is fun to read silently, but you just want to recite it out loud. It is a great book to start kids reading. They will learn to love reading, just as I have, with the help of The Foot Book."
3,"great book for kids ""my age""","This book is great because it shows little kids different types of feet and show them, a little bit, which foot is left and which is right. It is also great for children that are beginning to read because it helps them comprehend the words much much better. I belive that it could still stimulate the brain a bit more than just with 4 to 5 word sentences, yet it is for little kids."
4,The Foot Book,"This book appeals to children of all ages and my mom even loved it.It is a good book for beginning readers to read on their own because of the rhyming.It is a silly and funny book all about feet, what they can do and different feet.This is just a fun book to make you smile and laugh."
2,Not the best!,"This book isn't as good as some of the other Dr. Seuss books. Although it rhymes, it doesn't seem to keep my sons attention."
4,Feet dont smell in this book,"Feet dont smell in this book, Although, They ryme. A spooky thought. Its great for all ages to read,& there sure to want to go back and read it agian. It'll tie your tounge in a knot but it will put a smile on your face."
5,We read it and re-read it,"We've had this book since my son was born and he just loves it! I can repeat it from memory we've read it so often!!! The story is fun and educational. The pictures are bright and fun to look at! Its Dr Seuss, what more can I say?"
4,How many many feet you eat,"Reading is fundamental-but it all starts with chewing. My son loves to chew on this book. Board books are excellent for chewing; or at least my son thinks so. In contrast my daughter and I read this book together. We also love this book; but be warned ... we come to the task without using our sense of taste. Yet it is a tasteful book. Dr. Seuss was indeed a great writer. And that bears itself out in this wonderful book. This is clearly illustrated by the fact that after thirty-two years of his first publishing The Foot Book, Dr. Seuss has my son eating his feet."
2,not my favorite dr seuss,This book is a lame version of dr seuss's otherwise excellent and witty silly rhymes. This one repeats certain phrases that are not funny - but a stretch to try and mke things rhyme. Mr Brown can moo and there's a wocket in my pocket are much better picks
1,the foot book,... REVIEW ON THE FOOT BOOK . I did not like this book towell but it is ok.The book is a good ryming book and a good book for little kids like my sister she is 8 .The book is about all kinds of feet and how they are different feet.The author is a good rymer for little kids and they would like this book andwill enjoy it a lot.
5,I think this book is great !!!,This book has great pictures. I like Dr.Seuss books. I like how Dr. Seuss makes up the words for how they talk. I think my little sister and anyone who likes Dr. Seuss would like to read this book.
3,Okay for now...,"I have picked up several of the 'adapted for board book format' Dr. Seuss books (The ABC Book, 10 Apples, etc.) and though I realize that they are ""adapted"" for younger readers or for a shorter format, and have never noticed anything glaringly amiss, . This book, however, I noticed a lot that didn't flow quite right. The last time I had read ""The Foot Book"" was probably 5 years ago but I kept misplacing words and getting off-beat with the rhymes. My son likes it as well as other books, I just know that it's going to bug me every time I read it (why change ""trick feet"" to ""well feet"" to accomodate the ""opposite"" theme while leaving the picture of the character juggling?) Probably would not buy again without reading through completely, though, as I said, none of the other bright and early board books have struck me so blatantly with their changes. I guess we'll just wait until he can understand not to tear pages before reading the Foot Book again."
5,Sons favorite book too,This was one of my favorite books when I was a child and now being able to read it to my son is wonderful and he LOVES it!
2,who are the good guys?,"The acting is fine for the period, but the story is weak, and the ""good guys"" are just as bad as the ""bad guys"". For example, when the kids riot, set fire to buildings, and cause the warden's death, it's ""justified"" because he ""brought it on himself"". It wouldn't be so bad if the movie weren't clearly trying to justify the bad behavior of the reforming criminal and the kids in the reform school."
2,Disappointing,"My anticipation was high as much of the literature on PTSD in forensic context is very new. Chapters are written by individuals reputed to be knowledgable in each area. Editing left much redundancy, such that I skip 1/4 of the book because I'd alread read it! It is also very elementary. If you have very little idea of what PTSD is, and have never been to court, this is for you. Others, keep looking."
2,A worthy concept. A disappointing movie.,"A worthy concept. A disappointing movie.The production values were straight out of late 60s early 70s low budget American television: the hard contrast videotape appearing visuals; the harsh, hollow audio, sounding as if recorded in a big empty studio; clumsy superimposed images; the dated piano and cello underscore, and even the narrative structure reminded be of the Sunday morning dramas of faith which I watched occasionally in the early 70s. The production sensibilities landed so solidly in the style of low budget contemporary television drama of the early 70s that I simply could not convince myself that the movie took place at any other time despite the sets, costumes, and subject matter.The movie itself expressed and belabored its themes with the same subtlety as those Sunday morning television parables as well. There's potential in this story and I hope it receives a better treatment sometime."
1,Better Information Elsewhere,"Kelley has become a generic name due to its longevity so buyers look there for vehicle pricing. With the advent of the Internet, vehicle information that is more relevant to the consumer is now available through Edmunds.com or Yahoo cars. Kelly historically focused on dealer-centric cost which was OK when they were the only company around. Today, consumer information can be best obtained elsewhere."
1,Dumb and dumber,"Anyone who can't spell ""its"" correctly is not going to get my money. If you want to know about the American flag, I suggest you read Whitney Smith's ""The Flag Book of the United States"" (Morrow Paperback, 1975). When it comes to vexillology, Smith ""wrote the book"".Note added July 2010: I note ""It's"" [sic] has been corrected. Still, Smith's is the book to read."
4,Equestrian Equipment,"A worthwhile catalog of Equestrian equipment of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The catalog is black and white. Many of the pieces detailed are from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NY. The item descriptions are separate from the images so you have to do a little page flipping and number matching. Like any museum catalog, it gives a brief description of the item, its provenance if known, and materials."
2,Meh,"This book amounts to a sermon with a novel written around it. The characters are underdeveloped and I'm not engaged emotionally with them. The characters are at times aggravating, the ""liberal pastor"" is portrayed as more or less an atheist, the conservative wife does nothing except for cry and pray, the daughter is a waste of ink, and the bad guys are all minorities. Honestly, the only characters I liked were murdered off early on.The flow of the book is choppy. He seemed to jump forward in time and change perspective without notice from time to time. Some of the events aren't rationalized very well, leaving the reader to come to their own conclusions as to why they happened. I this may be the reason why some readers find the events unbelievable.As a sermon I didn't care for it much either. He makes good points, but when he describes the three basic ways you can view the bible, his reasonable center point is still to the right."
5,Fantastic Christian fiction,I have read all three of Randall Arthur's books and enjoyed them all. I check every once in a while to see if he has written anything new but as of this date.... no. I still keep hoping.Jordan's Crossing is well written and cover tough topics in the world of a Christian - but are all so true and real.
3,"I'm glad I read it, but tragic events were unbelievable.","Jason Faircloth, a conservative preacher, was a bad example of what any preacher should be purely because of his attitude. Many of the events were just too unbelievable. All in all I'm glad I read it, but now want to see if he has improved int Jordan's Crossing."
5,Right on time,"Item arrived in timely manner in great condition, I'm very happy with it! A friend lent it to me during a very challenging time in my life and knew I had to make it mine. Now we each have a copy and I am enjoying not wondering when it will be requested back:) Great life lessons in a gentle delivery make it easy to relate and open up to the wisdom contained in each track."
1,Lugosi Gives His All in Shoddy Chapterplay,"A no-budget Victory serial, ""Shadow of Chinatown"" (1936) has little to offer except the sinister presence of Bela Lugosi, whose lively performance as a Eurasian scientist cannot redeem 15 uneventful chapters. The condensed 70-minute feature is a slight improvement only for its brevity. Bela's first collaboration with low-rent producer Sam Katzman."
4,brief history of the universe,"I read this book knowing little about Irish history and less about Irish traditional music. Having finished it I now know considerably more about both, but still don't know much about anything in any depth. This book is a wonderful primer, but it blows through several hundred years of history in 161 small pages. It is well written book and the connections made between historical events and the music that either recorded them lyrically or grew out of them (e.g., incorporation of various Scottish or Polish rhythms) are fascinating and done in a consistent manner.This book is an excellent place to start in on this topic, but you'll finish wanting more."
5,I really like it!,"I like it because it is so funny. It had trains, planes and all those other loud things. I didn't believe my eyes! If you read it, you will think it's funny too I hope! My name is Cassie and I read this book."
5,excellent choice,"I used to read this book to my son, now I have been able to share it with my grand daughter. She loves all the rhyming, it helps keep a toddlers attention."
1,small infant book,attention to those ppl looking for a great deal.... please be mindful when ordering these that they are the very small board books... unfort i did not realize this when bought them.. very disapointed child on xmas.
4,MOTOWN LEGENDS:JUST MY IMAGINATION-BEAUTY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP,"I MUST SAY WITH ALL HONESTY THAT I LOVE THIS CD. SOME OF THE SONG WERE NOT THAT FAMOUS, HOWEVER, IT DOES'NT DEMINISH ANY OF THE VOCALS. THERE IS A SONG ON THIS DISC CALLED"" I'M ON FIRE (BODY SONG) I HAD NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE AND ONCE IT WAS INJECTED INTO MY SOUL IT WAS AS GREAT OR EVEN BETTER THAT SOME OF THE MOST MEMORABLE ONE'S. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL TEMPTATION LOVER'S"
3,They sure were great,"Got some duds on it, but how many albums have all awesome songs. Good enough. Hokey pokey may be the best tune on it though."
2,Re-Mastered my Arse!,"I agree with the previous reviewer-the remastering is pitiful! It is muddy, not bright, no high end clarity. Shame on Island/Universal for botching this! (note: I also purchased ""I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight"" from the same 2004 re-master releases and it sounds muddy as well. I would guess the whole remaster series is bunk!)"
4,Another great item from Kitchenaid!,The pouring shield makes pouring flour in a running mixer a lot less hassle. It also helps when pouring in a lot of wet ingredients in at once too.
5,Needful cover,I bought my Kitchen Aid without the shield. The mixer works fast and quickly but I could not use it at high speeds because it would throw my mixing ingredients out of the bowl. The splash guard really makes a difference.
2,better than nothing but not a stellar design,"My two piece splatter shield came with the KA mixer I purchased about 20 years ago. The mixer still runs beautifully but the splatter shield is problematic. One of the tabs broke off completely so I use one hand to hold it together while with the other hand I try to contain the flour spraying out from between the lip of the bowl and the loose splatter shield. What I would like it a snug fitting shield with a silicone gasket to prevent the spray out. The spray out problem is not caused by the broken tab, but by the loose fitting design. I'm trying to decide whether to purchase another shield...might go with the one piece because there is less chance of breakage but on the down side - more room for flour to fly out because of the open area in the design."
2,don't buy if you own a pro series,This is a big waste of money if you are looking to buy one for your pro series mixer. The claims that it will fit any 4.5qt and 5qt are inaccurate.
3,sort of handy,"Well, mine came free with my mixer so I guess I shouldn't complain. I'll complain anyway. The shield is handy in that it does help to keep splatter to a minimum, unless you use it w/ the 3 quart bowl accessory - nothing helps that bowl because its too short. The downside of the shield is that I find it awkward to use the pour shield. Its easier to take the thing off to add more ingredients."
2,pouring shield awkward,i found that the shield doesn't properly fit with the 5-quart mixer. it seemed to make more of a mess than be of any real use.
3,"Useful, depending on what you use your mixer for...","The shield does come in handy, but only sometimes. I don't use it everytime I use my mixer. For a lot of things it is useless. But it works perfectly for gradually adding dry ingrediants. It is great for gradually adding flour to make a dough.The shield is also GREAT for when kids want to help mix ingrediants, keeps little fingers far from danger.The shield splits in two parts, which tend to fall apart easily. It was done this way, so you can lift up half of the shield and scrape around the edges of the bowl, without having to completely remove it. It is a great idea, but it makes the shield very flimsy, and falls apart easily.It is not a must-have for your mixer, but if you makes lots of doughs etc, it is well worth the $15."
5,love kitchenaid!,this shield really makes using the mixer a lot easier. i love the fact that this shield doesn't have a removable shoot. i've used others that did and the crack where it connects makes it messy to use it for liquids.
2,Not a fan of the two-part shield,"I've had my stand mixer for about eight years now and I LOVE it. However, I've never been a fan of the two-part pouring shield design. It's always coming apart and popping off the bowl.I see that Kitchen Aid's Web site now offers a shield that is one piece ($24.99). I think I'm going to have to put that one on my wish list!"
2,Not designed correctly.,"I wanted a shield to allow easy addition of ingredients to the mixer, but this one is not designed well enough to facilitate it.The shield comes into two parts, held together by the rim of the bowl and two small tabs. It easily falls apart when removing and is hard to get back on without taking the whole thing off and putting it back.The funnel portion is not long enough to allow ingredients to be poured. Often, the component added spills or gets on the mixer.The rim of the bowl is too big as well. With the whisk attachment on the mixer, you cannot swing the top without hitting the rim. You have to perform a complex manuever of lifting the top a small amount, and then rotating the shield so that the pouring section aligns with where the whisk is stopped.This product needs a serious redesign to serve its function."
3,A good thing to have but not essential.,"My mixer came with this thing. I rarely use. There are two very good reasons to use it. First, if you are making something like, say, pesto, where it's sloppy juicy, this will keep you from getting green oily spots all over your clothes. Second, when making bread (or some other such edible), you can use the little ramp to pour the flour down and thereby reduce the flour that ends up on the counter and floor and you and your lab and each cat and any passing strangers.Now if you are a sort of bare chested cooking adventure type, just leave that shield in the drawer and let the dust settle where it may.One other thing I should mention: it is designed to be easily installed and removed while the machine is in operation. It works."
2,My Least Used Piece of Kitchenaide Equipment,"Let me be honest. I don't like this attachment. It sits too close to the arm of the mixer. Therefore if you pour anything in while the mixer is going, it just puffs up around you. I works if you take the time to turn the mixer off, but otherwise, you will have nice clouds of flour while making cookies. Since it sits too close to the arm, the food just gets all over the mixer, and you spend more time cleaning off the mixer than what you would save. I would recommend that you spend your money on an extra bowl rather than this."
4,"Great Accessory, but can sometimes be a hindrance","The pouring shield came free with my KitchenAid mixer, and I use it very often to get flour and other ingredients easily into my mixer without spills. Without this attachment, using the mixer would be much messier. On the other hand, it is a hassle to take the pouring shield off every time I want to scrape the bowl down and $20 is expensive for such a simple attachment. All in all, though, the pouring shield is very good."
3,A useful item,"Because of the design of the Kitchenaide stand mixer, it's very difficult to pour ingredients in while the machine is working, so I jumped at the chance to get this pouring shield. It does do exactly what it promises, and works very well, but it's a little unweildy to attach and put together, and doesn't fit very tight; however, once you get it on, it does do exactly what it's designed for, and helps immeasurably, especially when adding liquid and eggs to the batter.Overall, it was worth the discounted price I got it for, but I think it's rather overpriced at regular retail. Since it's a specialty item, and only for Kitchenaide stand mixers, they really don't have to price it competitively. Worth it if you can get it on good sale."
3,Wrong Item,"They sent the item fairly fast, however they sent the wrong one. I had a hard time getting ahold of their customer service. Once I did, they sent me a label to ship it to them to exchange it. I never received the original item I ordered and they finally issued me a refund."
2,"Good Idea, but not worth the trouble","I found this up on the shelf over the refrigerator yesterday, took me a while to remember what it was. It was up there with the 50 pounds of paprika I couldn't live without. I love my KA mixer, I think maybe I used this thing twice. It does work if you remember to drag out the step stool and deal with all the dross on top of the fridge, but I really think it's not worth the effort. I never had any trouble using it, but if you are like me, the counter gets flour on it anyway when you do the final kneading, so what's the problem. It's just one more thing to wash. Other than dry ingrediants, I can't think of what else you would use it for. It's cute, I'm trying to teach the cats to jump through it until I put it back up in the cupboard...that means I'd have to clear off the step stool again and climb up...maybe it belongs down cellar, that's easier. Not an essential item in my kitchen."
3,Kitchen Aid pouring shield review,I love the product itself but I was disappointed how it was shipped. Packing slip and stickers were applied to the product itself instead of it being shipped ina seperate box. Maybe that's my fault for not checking before hand but it made it difficult to gift this way. Other then that it is like I purchased it from a big chain retail store.
2,Misleading S/H,"I love the product. I am reviewing the misleading way Amazon lists the S/H fee. You can't even see that they charge an additional fee, because they put it in a light grey color. It cost half the price of the product. If I had seen that information, I wouldn't have ordered the product from them. Absurd!I work for a company that ships product all around the country daily. I understand how much it costs, how long it takes, and the work that goes into it by all the departments. I will not order from this company again and I will definitely keep my eyes open for the S/H placement. Key point, don't order product in the dark, as you won't see the additional fees in the grey color."
1,advised by KitchenAid customer service,"While checking with KitchenAid customer service regarding this particular pouring spout I was advised it was no longer made nor sold by KitchenAid due to the complaints by customers of the 2 piece design and it falling into the bowl. I was advised to purchase the 1 piece pouring shield for my mixer and am so grateful to have read other comments on Amazon by customers advising to call KitchenAid... such a great site where consumers rule and are not limited to speak the truth.I have since purchased the 1 piece pouring shield, bowl covers and an extra bowl for my mixer."
2,pouring shield,I am disappointed in this item. It fits loosely on my bowl and is not what the picture looks like. It does not protect from spatter all the way around. I should have kept my paper work and sent it back.
1,Probably Good But...,In spite of the size specifications on this product it does not fit. It cost qlmost as much to return as the original price so I'm stuck with it. It's too big for the 5 qt bowl lift mixer in spite of what it says.
3,It sometimes works,"This works sometimes. The two piece design has tabs on it that is sometimes difficult to remove while the machine is in operation, as I'm afraid that the plastic piece will end up in the bowl as it's mixing. There have been occasions where it vibrates apart. Don't use it to pour flour with the kneading hook in operation, as once flour went all over the kitchen from the little platform at the top of the hook.It's ok, if I'm careful about how I use it."
2,Not so great,"I have a 25 year old Kitchenaid which in my estimation is gold standard for home-kitchen stand mixers, and I used to cook professionally so I've used a few. This so-called shield, however, doesn't measure up to the brand standard. It is not as snug as it ought to be, and powdery ingredients fly out from under where it ought to seal to the bowl. The problem would be realtively easy to resolve with a rubber or silicone gasket to make an actual seal, but they haven't bothered despite the products perpetually mediocre reviews on most sites. Cooks who own Kitchenaid mixers are pretty serious about their cooking and their issues should be given the attention they merit. Wake up Kitchenaid."
1,Didn't fit,This item had to be returned because it didn't fit my Kitchen Aid - there should be an easier system for matching up accessories!
3,just doesn't fit the bowl,it arrived on time tried it on bowl christmas day and it is too small probably more to return it than it cost so don't have one right now.
3,"Useful, at times. A hassle, at times.","I haven't used it with a liquid yet, I only use this product when adding flour/dry ingredients. As soon as the risk of the ""flour explosion"" is over,or the dry ingredients are mostly combined, I remove it. This is because if you are making bread, or a stiff dough that tends to climb up the bowl, it will knock off the pouring shield. It can be tedious to use, and it is an extra piece to wash. Also, you can't actually pour the dry ingredients in. You have to push them down the chute. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because when it is on, it contains the flour/dry ingredients exceptionally well. Hence, I usually only use it when making bread doughs. I just wish it was a snug fit. It just loosely rests on the bowl."
3,Necessary Accessory,"I feel the Pouring Shield will be an extremely useful accessory. But, because of the lightness of construction, necessary for its purpose,it may need replacing periodically due to wear and tear."
3,Not as pictured.,"The item is not as pictured. It shows a full round shield but the one I received had an opening and only goes around about 3/4 of the bowl. Still, works well and am happy with it. Definitely helps keep splattering down although you do still have to be careful when adding liquids."
3,not quite satisfy,"It's great that the shield fits all model but it doesn't tighten to the bowl. If you beat something like flour and the dough rises up and hit the shield, the shield would lift up. Basically the shield is quite loose to fit into the bowl."
5,A must have item,This item arrived promptly and was exactly what I expected. I am very pleased and no longer have ingredients all over my counters when I use my mixer. It's easy to use and easy to clean.
3,Pictures Are Deceiving,The picture looks like the original part but the replacement product only covers about 3/4 of the top of the mixer (not counting the place where you are supposed to pour things into the blender) forcing you to put your hand over the gap to keep the dry ingredients in the bowl until they start to mix with the liquid ones. Picture needs to be revised to show what the prelacement looks like.
4,SPLATER GUARD FOR KITCHENAID MIXER,"I LIKE THE SPLATTER GUARD IT DOES HELP WITH SPLATTERS. HOWEVER IT DOES NOT FIT A 5 QUART MIXING BOWEL VERY TIGHT IT SLIPS OFF EASILY, IT DOES THIS WORSE ON A 4 1/2 QUART MIXING BOWEL. BUT I STILL WOULD RECOMMEND IT WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE TO THE PURCHERER."
1,ruined my kitchen aid,"Save your money! I purchased this item in hopes to reduce the mess. I attached the guard (did not fit well), added my ingredients, slightly bumped the guard and it fell into the mixer bowl while it was mixing. Needless to say, it jammed my kitchen aid mixer and off-set the attachment and the bowl; I recommend using a big damp towel and cover the entire unit when you try to mix flour, powder sugar, etc. type of ingredients."
5,Quality is appreciated,"a good product that fits well and does what it is supposed to do....well made, Buy this with confidence."
5,A dazzling intellectual and spiritual treasure . . .,"I've never met this book's equal. It left me awestruck not only by the content but by its style. Every sentence is a jewel that could be studied over for years. While reading this book, I wondered at Huxley's genius. Possibly the best book I've ever read"
2,Kindle version not up to par,"What a wonderful work. All the more disappointing therefore that no one at Harper Collins found the time to proofread the newly available Kindle version, which is filled with errors -- apparently the result of a less than adequate scanner. I cannot tell you how distracting it is to find ""soldier"" become ""solthier,"" and ""die to self"" become ""the to self."""
3,"Fine, But I recommend you read the mature Huxley","Certainly this work is representative of a stage in Huxley's spiritual career. At the time both he and Gerald Manley Hall were in a very ""Manichean"" phase and, as the above New Yorker blurb suggests Huxley was at this time very ""otherworldly"".After his experiences with LSD and his encounters with Krishnamurti, Huxley returned to life. Read this book as a precursor to Huxley's mature statements, butdo follow up with a read of his post-psychedelic writings, such as ""Doors of Perception"", etc to be found in ""Moksha""."
4,Huxley = GOD.,"Jumps around from religion to religion, but seems to stay on the same topics, relating and conntecting all sects throughout the world into a more simplistic understanding of higher powers. Highly reccomended to read ""Doors of Perception"" before picking this one up though."
4,Not too bad,"The book came in good quality but because I ordered it for a gift, it took forever to get here and I missed giving it to them on their birthday. Good thing they are forgiving. Overall good sale."
2,Great bricolage poor structure,"I truly love Aldous Huxley's work~! However this particular book I found extremely hard to read. The Perennial Philosophy is really just a cluttered mess or a disorganized compilation of the greatest thinkers,religious scholars and scriptures weaved together by Huxley's analytical interpretations of them. It doesn't serve the heart, instead it complicates the already convoluted mind into more analytical thinking."
5,review of The Perennial Philosophy,Amazon's quick delivery service has provided a time to really enjoy this work. Difficult to understand yet insightful in so many meaningful ways. The work in itself is a compliation of how humans understand the eternal life and a supreme being. Each quote is worth pondering carefully. This is a book I strongly recommend to those prepared to read different view points. The conclusion summarizes two simple commandments.
4,Indispensable Gem!,"I feel some of the more critical reviewers posting here coming from a very glib place. Maybe 'old man Huxley' is too stuffy (too Victorian?) for the modern, confident, e-informed seeker. I love this book because I know the context of the man's life and where it came from. Discover Huxley! His flaws are obvious, sure, but nothing in comparison to the difficulties he overcame and the giant leap he provided to the thinkers of his generation (and the seekers of the next!) For me the value of this book is in the rich, generous treasure-chest of quotes provided, and finally, for its unusually clear distinction between what is 'psychic' what is 'mystical' and what is 'spiritual.'"
5,Perennial Philosophy Aldous Huxley,The Most needed and enlightening book in our individual search for meaning and desperately spiritual seeking age. A book for the heart as well as the mind.
1,Hank Williams Songbook,"This CD is very mialeading, All imformation on it indicates that this Cd has songs sang by Hank Williams, in reality there is not ONE SINGLE SONG in there, sung by Hank, only other aetists singing his songs, and not very well either, with the exception of Marty Robbins! I feel the discription of tis CD shhould be changed to properly portray what it really contains."
5,Why isn't this released in CD?,"This is by far my favorite Christmas album ever. Every year I thumb through the Christmas sections in various stores hoping it will turn up in CD or even tape. Every year I'm rejected. For anyone interested, you can still find people selling the album on Ebay, but I don't even have a record player anymore. These songs remind me of decorating the tree with Mom and leaving cookies and milk out for Santa. I can remember listening to this album and gazing through the frosted window watching the snow fall outside and looking up into the night for Santa. If any album should be re-released in CD, it should be this one."
5,A CHRISTMAS ALBUM WITH A HISTORY,"I FIRST PURCHASED THIS ALBUM ON A LP RECORD FOR MY GRANDPARENTS IN 1967! SINCE THEN I HAVE SEARCHED EVERY CHRISTMAS FOR A CASSETTE AND/OR CD. IT IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE CHRISTMAS ALBUM, ONE YOU CAN PLAY FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN! THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE THOSE WE ALL GREW UP WITH."
5,The search is over!,"My childhood memories of Christmas include listening to this masterpiece Christmas album. My sister let me have the album twenty years ago and I have searched every year to find it to replace my scratched LP. Yet we still listen to it each season with the static and scratches. I finally can return the album to her. The songs bring so much meaning to Christmas. Especially ""Little Toy Trains"" and ""Christmas is for Children"" are songs that young and old can cherish for years to come. Everyone can relate to ""It Must Be Getting Close To Christmas"" as a child and adult. I too am surprised noone else has ever recorded these songs. I am elated that my search is over and highly recommend this album to everyone who enjoys a classic, one of a kind Christmas album that sounds as modern today as it did thirty years ago!"
4,Christmas memories,"I grew up listening to this album every Christmas. My mother loved it and would play it often, especially at bedtime. His voice was so mellow and soothing. Now I sing ""Little Toy Trains"" to my little boy as he is going to sleep. I just had to buy this CD to start our own traditions and and memories in our little family!"
5,Oldie but goodie,"I was so excited to find this album available finally! I've looked for it before, but never been able to find it! I listened to this as a kid and teenager, when vinyl was still ""in"". It's a wonderful collection of Christmas songs and you can't beat Glen Campbell!"
5,Desert Island Christmas Music,"If I could only have one Christmas album, this would be it. I was so thrilled to see the entire album available again after all these years. It isn't Christmas without these wonderful songs!"
5,Excited to see this again,"When I was ten years old, I asked for this album for Christmas. I played it innumerable times every Christmas season. My all time favorite Christmas song is ""Little Altar Boy"" I still have the album, but nothing to play it on. I have looked ""everywhere"" for it on CD or even casette with no luck. So I'm getting the download and will listen to it over and over."
5,A Christmas to Remember !!,"WOW....what an amazing trip down memory lane this album was !! Like many of the previous reviewers, I grew up on this album and can't help but be transported back in time to my childhood and Christmasses gone by when I hear these songs....the warmth and family feel of Christmas is all in there !!! Just close your eyes and listen to the songs like: ""Christmas is for Children"" and my personal favorite ""Old Toy Trains""......instantly you'll see the snow falling in big fluffy flakes around you.....your Mom serving up hot chocolate....sled riding in the backyard....decorating the tree......its truly magical !! A tough album to find but well worth it !! If I could only have one album with Christmas songs on it.....I would take this one over all others !! AMAZING !!"
1,Don Quijote de la Mancha (Audio CD),"Fantastic !It's better than reading the book. Obviously, it does not go into all the details, but as you listen to the interpreters voices, and the music, you feel as if you are in a theater.I'd strongly recommend it to anyone interested in a Classic rendition of one of the best books ever written.Angel Aguilar"
5,Don Quijote Man of The Mancha Audio Book on CD,The audio quality and dramatic production are excellent. My husband said the acting scared him when he walked in the room not knowing what they were saying in Spanish!
2,I liked the 1999 better,"Well, all things told, I have to say that this one was a bit of a letdown. Of course, following such a massive achievement as the 1999 edition is a tough act no matter how you look at it. A better preparation job would have been in order, I find that the bovine and ass sections tend to drag. The introductory chapter adequately sets up the whole thing, but the structure seems a little lacking. All in all, I would say that the research group needs to get their act together if they are going to hold our interest much longer."
4,"Offal, just offal...","As a software developer working in this industry, I found this to be a truly breezy, pick-me-up of a read. I couldn't put it down. I hope that Sheep The Edible Offals of Bovi, et al are working on the next riveting issue of this compendium.Hopefully, the next installment will give more attention to the issues surrounding exports of subterranean offal. Many countries, particularly in the West, are investing post-millennial resources developing this emerging market with a heretofore unimaginable gusto."
2,Not enough power,"I am still trying to make this attachment work, but the mixer really does not have enough power to push the dough through the extractor. It is also very picky about how wet or dry the dough is. Too wet clogs the grinder worm, too dry gets stuck in extractor. I did manage to make one batch work, but am not sure what I did!"
1,not recommended,"I agree with the reviewer below who says that it is impossible to make the dough dry enough to not get all gummed up. It is easier to make pasta with an inexpensive hand-operated roller than it is with this attachment. I ended up buying the KitchenAid pasta roller attachment, which does a much better job."
1,Not worth the frustration,"I purchased this attachment in hopes of making pasta shapes which weren't possible with my hand crank pasta maker, or simply to save time, but after many failed attempts and much cursing, I returned it. As several other reviewers have commented, the pasta clumps together as it is extruded, no matter how dry the dough. The motor seems to heat up the dough, so that it becomes impossibly sticky, and the noodles don't come straight out as one might hope. Definitely a bad investment."
4,Pleasant Pasta Maker,"This pasta maker delivers on it's promise. Place the dough down into the channels and fresh homemade pasta snakes it's way out of the machine. I tasted the final product and I was pleasantly surprised.Now, having said that, there are some provisos under which this machine operates. You will need a lot of dough to make enough pasta to feed more than one person.You will need to flour said pasta to keep it from sticking together to make a giant ball.You will need to focus on keeping the pressure on the plunger to force the dough down into the channel.But, like any culinary experience, it takes time, dedication, and attention to detail. Was it worth the price? Yes. Is the pasta like mama used to make? More or less. I bought this pasta maker as a gift and I think it will get a lot of miles before retirement."
1,Burned out my mixer,"I did not exceed the ""make 2 batches then let the mixer rest for 1 hour"" but before I finished my batch the mixer started making a horrible grinding and clunking noise.I turned it off and cleaned out the rest of the dough, and then put an icepac on the top of the mixer... it was SOOOOO hot !!!Now I have no KA mixer :(YAY I get to go online and research how to fix my mixer, or pay to have it serviced, or drop it at the recycling place. DANGIT !! I paid for 2 day shipping because I was so excited to get my pasta going."
4,Happy I purchased it,"We've only used the meat grinder, not the pasta attachment yet. So far, so good."
1,Must agree with negative reviews,"I have not tried this pasta attachment a second time - I'm afraid of harming the motor. The mixer became VERY hot and oil even leaked out. I going to get the mixer checked/serviced and not risk damage again. One thing missing from these reviews is the mixer models used. Perhaps those with the heavier motors work better? I have the smaller motor (250 W) K45SS mixer. Surely KitcheAid must read these reviews. I would expect some additional user information for this product on their website, but see nothing. Very disappointing product and consumer support. Come on KitchenAid - give more info and/or offer to give $$ credit for return of this questionable product."
1,Made my motor smoke!,"The first time I used it with a single batch of pasta, the motor got very hot. Smelled a little too. Got me worried.But not so worried that I didn't try it again, weeks later. I made a double batch. Again, the motor heated up & was smelling. A little way into the second batch, it started smoking. I stopped it, and will not use it again, especially after reading what others have posted.I am worried that I have or will soon wear out my motor. My mixer is just under a year old. I hope they stand by their warranties.I can't believe I am giving a KA product a *1*, but I am. Save your money & your motor!!!!Edited to add: KitchenAid replaced my mixer (Artisan) because it was still within the 1 year warranty. I did not have my sales receipt, but they could tell the manufacture date from numbers on the bottom of the machine. I will not be using the pasta attachments with my new machine!"
2,Dreadful: Buy the meat grinder instead,"I bought the combination meat grinder-pasta makr kit (which is the same as this item but with the addition of the screw and plates for meat grinding) and I'm sorry to say that the pasta dies just don't work. Even when using the included recipe, it turns into a gloppy mess."
1,Get the roller attachments instead,"These dies make really thick pasta; there's no choice for things like lasagne or ravioli strips. The hollow/ziti/macaroni die really doesn't function, because when you cut the pasta off the die, it closes down one end. If you want it to be hollow, you have to use a toothpick to reopen every piece of pasta. Who's going to do that? Something similar happens with the spaghetti/fettucini dies--once cut with a knife, they all stick together. I recommend the roller option. I love that one! It works like a dream; really, it's incredible how fast it works."
4,Gets a bad rap,I have to say that I was a bit sketchy on this product after reading other reviews. I'm glad I bought it anyway. One major key to using this attachment successfully is the dough consistency. Dryer is better - but not too dry. You'll get the hang of it after a couple tries. I do recommend making pasta with another person as another set of hands will come in handy. Enjoy!
5,Review for meats only,"First, I am reviewing the meat-grinding part only. And for that I give this attachment five stars. I've used mine for at least 15 years and it has always performed flawlessly in that aspect. I am now noticing stress cracks around the part that inserts into the machine, but as long as it doesn't break I see no need to replace it.Every time the news buzzes with yet another ground meat recall I can't help but breathe a sigh of relief that I know for sure that my batches of ground meat contain only one cow and not hundreds, which reduces the chance of salmonella contamination significantly. This is probably my most-used KitchenAid attachment. I can't imagine life without it..."
1,Piece of JUNK,"I have made many batches of noodle using all types of dough. Also. I have taken my KA5 apart, repaired it an put it back together when I striped the gear for the second time in 20 years and my repairman was no where to be found(instructions are online if you ever have this issue).so, you should know I am a HUGE fan of my KA5 and wouldn't consider life without this workhorse. HOWEVER, this particular attachment is not worthy of purchase at all for any reason. I have followed the instructions to the n-th degree and have yet to extract any usable noodles from the attachment. I always end up pulling the large pasta roller attachment out and making them that way. Don't buy this attachment. If you want homemade pasta, buy the set of 3 rollers and go to town.As Julia said, 'Let's not be noodle snobs, but once you have homemade ones, well there just not like anything else you've ever tasted."""
3,Pasta Maker?,"The pasta dough has to be very dry for the extruder plates to work well. Otherwise, the product sticks together and cannot be separated."
3,tai chi with strength training,"For someone looking for a pure tai-chi video, this isn't it. if you'd like to do some tai chi moves with strength training, this IS it. The video is divided into strength training and tai-chi segments, but each was too short to get *too* much out of it. especially the tai-chi segments - by the time you figured out exactly how to move, it was already time to move to the next part. This video would be great supplemented by other videos to enforce both parts - a pure tai chi video and a pure strength training video; this would be perfect for those times you want to do a little of both."
5,Rapid car charger for Samsung SGH T609,"Really a rapid charger, has pleasant blue light indicator. Retractable, hence no hanging wires. Happy with the purchase."
4,Maple?,"I like this frame, but the maple is way too orange. I really wish it came in a pewter and a gold finish. It is just the kind of frame I need for some of my craft projects."
5,Perfect for the smaller jobs,"This is an ideal addition to your Kitchen Aid mixer for complicated recipes that use multiple bowls, or for smaller jobs like whipping cream."
5,Kitchen Aid 3 Qt Mixing Bowl,"I purchased this bowl as a gift for my Mother. Kitchen Aid only provides one large bowl with their stand mixer. My mother looked in every store, but could not find a smaller bowl to suit her needs. I was happy to find the 3 qt bowl at Amazon. My mother is very pleased with it!"
4,"First bowl didn't fit KSM150 (Artisan Mixer), but 2nd did.","Ordered this as a present for my wife, but upon delivery discovered it doesn't fit our Artisan stand mixer (model KSM150). The locking base on the bowl is about 1/8th of an inch too wide to fit into the receptacle on the mixer. When I spoke to the representative, she felt that the bowl must be defective, so I'm hoping the replacement fits. However, the finish and construction of the bowl seemed very nice, so I'm not too confident that it will. I'll update this if the new bowl (same model) ends up fitting correctly.UPDATE: Received replacement today, and the new bowl (same model/item number) fits great! I'm only upgrading the review to 4 stars due to the defective first bowl."
5,Nice item costing less than manufacturer retail price,"I like this smaller bowl for mixing smaller quantity items; such as puddings, icings, etc. The big 5 Qt. bowl is sometimes just to big for mixing some things. Also, a big plus, there was no charge for shipping!"
5,Excellent addition to my Kitchen Aid,"This is a great second bowl for a Kitchen Aid stand mixer set. Though smaller than the bowl that comes with the mixer, it is fine for many mixing jobs. Because it has no handle, it stores easily inside the main bowl. That's a great thing for those of us with crowded kitchen cabinets!"
4,Does exactly what you think it should...,"Mixes smaller batches and whips < 3 egg whites properly, which the larger bowl has trouble with. Very happy with this purchase, easy to use, clean and store."
3,"Beautiful bowl, but misleading item description","This bowl is lovely, but that doesn't fix the fact that it doesn't fit in my Kitchenaid Accolade. The first line under ""Features"" here on Amazon reads, ""Works with any KitchenAid Pivot Head stand mixer"", which the Accolade IS (a pivot head mixer). But this bowl does not fit in the base of the mixer, it is to narrow, so it doesn't lock in place. So be sure to check the quart size of your mixer before you purchase this bowl."
1,ummmmmmmm,How did this item double in its price in the last month? I was interested in buying it.. but now..
3,"Same as Summer Edition, except...","Volume 4 is the same as BLC Summer Edition, except, the mix on disc 2 is interrupted at track 2 and includes a song that clearly does not fit in the mix. Please OK Sound's remix of Summertime is replaced with a track called High in the Sky by EMO. They might have put out this version of BLC because of licensing issues. The packaging is also more like BLC 1-3, and does not contain the extra recipe book. I would look for a used version of BLC Summer Edition instead."
1,"Must remember, read product reviews first!","I have a 5 quart bowl, these are five quart lids, Simple? No, not really. They don't fit.Great Frisbee's though."
1,WARNING!,"As Shannon says, Kitchenaid mixer bowl covers are terrific for storing food and attachments. But be warned: these particular covers may not fit your mixer bowl! I purchased a new Artisan mixer & ordered these to go along with it, but they are too small. They do not fit the Artisan or KSM90 mixer bowls. Models they fit are KBC5N, K5SS, & KSM5 only."
1,KitchenAid Bowl Covers,The bowl covers are a great idea unfortunately for me I have an Artisan mixer and these bowl covers do not fit. According to KitchenAid Customer Service these are for a discontinued bowl the correct model number for the current 5qt bowl is KNBC.
2,Not what I thought they were!,"I guess I should have read the printed description better. When I saw these on Amazon they appeared to be more of a splash cover for the Kitchenaid stand mixer bowls, the image appeared to have a hole in the center, thus I thought it would be like the bowl cover for my hand mixer bowl I ordered through the Pampered Chef. I thought the lid could be placed on the bowl and the beater could go through the center hole and thus prevent splashing. No such luck, no hole in the middle and even if I adapted it and cut the plastic away from the indented center, the blade would not turn as it should. So now I have lids to put on the bowl to keep dirt and dust out!"
4,Classic Kitchenaid utilitarian design,"I didn't buy this for food storage - I bought it so I could keep my attachments inside the mixer bowl on the counter without them getting covered with grease and coffee grounds. For that purpose, these lids are perfect.The center well looks odd, but it's just the right depth to clear the mixer shaft when the lid is on the bowl on the mixer, and just the right width to allow two covered bowls to be stacked and stay stable.The lids lost a star because I washed one of them in a little too hot water in the dishwasher (on the bottom rack), and it shrunk slightly. It still goes on the bowl, but it strains to fit."
2,Not correct size,It is not the correct size of the KitchenAid mixer bowl. It is too small. I am very unsatisfied. Plastic quality is ok.
2,Is it the right size?,"I thought these would be great for baking storing icing or refrigerating cookie dough, these were I bit to small for my bowl so just make sure you order the right size."
5,Great addition to mixer!,I came across these by accident and decided to buy them. I am so glad that I did! They are perfect for chilling cookie dough or even homemade whipped cream. When I'm not using my mixer I keep my attachments in the bowl and covered by the lid.
2,they do not fit the artisan model,"I concur with the others, these do not fit the Artisan mixer. I did a lot of research on line, including with KitchenAid, to be told that this lid fit my mixing bowls.It does not."
1,Be warned! They do NOT fit securely over all 5qt bowls!,"I have a Kitchenaid model K5SSWH Heavy Duty Mixer and they do not fit over my 5 qt bowl. I regrettably only read the editorial review and bought these covers thinking I can snap them on. I use them to loosely cover my attachments now, but I could have used anything for that."
5,Sympathy for all,"By chance I came upon Traven at the library when I noted that he had authored ""Treasure of Sierra Madre,"" a film classic that I automatically associate with Hollywood's old Bogey.What I found most fascinating was the way Traven transcended cultural biases, opening a window to another world. In an obscure Mexican jungle town a seemingly poor and inconsequential boy dies. Yet what is revealed is a metaphor speaking to the proud spirit of an Aztec culture on the threshold of extinction."
4,Evocative and captivating,"Sets the scene brilliantly - you can 'see' the people, their surroundings, their squalor, the river and surrounding jungle, the changing light, etc - and I found myself thinking about and reliving the events after I'd finished the book, which isn't overly long. It's as though you've had a vivid, exotic dream you may never forget. There are also odd passages of the narrator's introspection which stick in the mind and warrant re-reading. The symbolism is obvious and powerful, but I consider the meaning more humanist than political. I don't believe in superstition, but this book helped me understand why other people might believe in it, and the arguable value of that. An easy, worthwhile read."
1,These didn't work for our labradoodle,We bought this trimmer with the intention of doing some light touching up around our labradoodle's face. We couldn't get this to cut through her facial hair at all. Perhaps it would work well on a dog whose hair isn't as curly and thick. After reading reviews we are going to pay the extra money and get an Oster A5 clipper.
5,Wonderful!!!!,The strings on this record playing many classic songs is one that I have danced in the living too carrying my babies! Each song is delightful although I still have my favorites....even take me out to the ball game and them golden slippers!! Highly recommend. I wish they made the dvd because I am currently without a record player. Enjoy!
4,Worthwhile,"I find this book a most fascinating one . . . and a ""required"" reading for those interested not just in China's history but modern genocide, mass media control by state press, Communist theory development, among many other topics. It is easy to read and gruesome aspects of the famine are dealt with respectfully and with sensitivity.I give it only four stars (rather than five) because I feel there is, at times, repetition of facts. All in all I highly recommend this book. Every person should read it to better understand and bring to light shameful acts against humanity."
2,Caveat emptor,"While it is admirable that Sony is making product available on an on-demand basis, buyers should be aware that these disks are (apparently) CD-Rs, and more importantly they do not come with any documentation, just an insert with the track listing. So no dates for recording, or such like (this isn't a problem for Serkin, whose discography can easily be found on the internet), but it does seem a little... cheap. Certainly it does not compare to ArchivMusik's excellent ""repressings"""
4,Is this a Mac OSX game?,"I believe that the X in the title means compatible with Mac OSX, though it is listed as a Win game. A look on the net shows that this is likely to be true."
1,Creative? How?,"The ""jewlery"" shown in this book are things you would praise if they were made by your primary school daughter, but nothing you would wear, no matter how daring or free your spirit is. The ""Creative Wire Jewelry"" were random twisted wires."
1,Creative Wire Jewlery,"Most of the designs in this beautifully photographed and prodeuced book will appeal to people who only do their own designing; and so I wonder who will make them, actually. There are lots and lots of coils, colors and textures in very contemporary, often big, pieces. Many of the designs are of the complex and chaotic sort suitable for very free spirits who dress in natural fibers. I was disappointed in the book and found nothing in it worth my attention."
1,Less Than One Star!!,"The title & cover of this book force the potential buyer into believing they may actually create REAL, GENUINE, AUTHENTIC JEWELRY!! In fact, all you get is an after-school daycare craft project using color coated craft wire, along with other sub-standard materials and so-called techniques. One would have to wonder how this book ever made it through the publisher's fact-finding department when they checked the definition of ""jewelry."" I don't mean to be cruel, but as someone who takes creating art jewelry very seriously, this just offends me. I beg anyone reading this....DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!! There are hundreds of books written by true jewelry artisans from whom you can actually learn real techniques that will inspire you like crazy! (Not someone who just barely started twisting wire a year and a half ago) Give one of those other ones a shot! Truly!"
5,Creative Wire Jewelry,"Kathy Peterson has written this lovely book in an ""easy to understand"" yet comprehensive manner. The projects and photography are great which shows readers clear step-by-step how-to's as well as good detailing on each jewelry project. Beginners and novice wire crafters will really enjoy this book."
5,My favorite book,"This book expresses that deep yearning to wander, to explore, to live fully like no other artistic expression I have ever come across. If you want your soul to be forever touched with the pure spirit of the natural world and the lust to wander in it, seek out this book. Be warned, you will never be the same again."
3,Fun but dumb...,"These nostalgia gift baskets that have shown up in the last few years are sort of fun but kind of lame. The food part of them has all the right gadgets and lookalikes inside but what ruins it is that the packaging people who do this have to follow 21st century labeling standards of specifc ingredients including barcodes. Nutrition facts and all those stupid warning things that make it seem like your Clark bar just got pumped out of a modern day Nestles plant. Kind of a downer. Too bad. Great idea if you didn't have to modernize it to make sure that your legal butt is covered. The real gift gadget would be for the items to appear EXACTLY as they were originally, without all those damn warnings and cautions to protect us. Oh for the REAL 50's again..or 40's, or 30's...."
5,Great Gift!,"I ordered this for my dad when he was in the hospital recovering from a stroke. my dad is a child of the 50's & he absolutely loved this!!! it was a huge pick-me-up for him. all the visitors & nurses & doctors loved it, also. this is an awesome gift for anyone who wants to reminisce about the 50's!!"
3,I like these period films,"If you liked the Roman Spring of Mrs Stone, you'll like this good period movie, which was filmed on location in Florence. I'll leave it to others to summarize the plot - I'll just say that it held my interest throughout, but it probably isn't one that I'll watch repeatedly like I can when I really love a film."
5,HATED IT!!!!!!!!!!!,"I hated the fact that I finished this book ONE night! There was over the top, juicy erotica expressed in each chapter! From Page one to 165, YOU WILL need a cold shower (or a hot lover)! The scenes were fun, imaginative, and the story line was great! I kinda saw the end coming, but getting there was MY PLEEEEAAAAA-ZZURRRRR! Torrian, your on my list. I will never let a book with your name on it, pass me by! WHO KNEW?"
3,"""Scandalous"" An Understament!!!","I purchased this book because it was .99 on my Kindle. I finished the book earlier today after attempting to stop reading it several times. The overall plot consisting of sex, lies, betrayal, murder and revenge was a good one. However, there are just way too many unnecessary, overly explicit raunchy sex scense. 2 or 3 would have surficed. No one practiced safe sex, which in this day and time is disgraceful, especially the way these characters were going at it! Once you get past all the raunch, when is basically the end of the book. It got really good in my opinion, too bad it took so long or I would have given it 4 stars. There were too many grammer errors for 5 stars."
4,"Tric...Ebony Book Lovers, Boston, MA","Torrian Ferguson's Scandalous is a must read if you are into black erotica!! Even though there was not much talk of ""safe sex"" the sex scenes were unbelievable. When I got to the ending it really surprised me...it left me saying you've got to be kidding. The book lives up to it's name... It really let's you know how ""scandalous"" people can be....."
4,ShockING,"Around and around we go as three roommates learn to share. Hmph...hmph...hmph... Some things should be singly owned, but sometimes it takes a valuable lesson to learn that everything isn't for your taking.Scandalous albeit is the first book I've read by author Torrian Ferguson, I'm hoping to make him a bookshelf favorite."
1,Predictable,Story and plot leaves something to be desired. I knew what was going to happen before it actually happened. More twist needed.
4,serious page turner,this book is true to its title scandlalous i loved the story line and it took you there with all the twist and turns.... i dont want to give the book away but i am glad michelle got what she had coming to her i screamed at her from the start and with friends like Eric who needs enemies you want to know what i am talking about get this one of a kind novel
2,Be careful to get the right bowl,"I ordered this for my 5 quart KitchenAid (Professional HD).Lo and behold it was not the right bowl, all 5 quart Kitchenaidmixers are not created equal, which is stupid and sucks, but thatis just how it is. Order it from Kitchenaid, the Amazon Marketplace seller(Today's Concept) made things difficult."
2,Is it the right size?,I love the idea of having an extra bowl and coulnt wait for this to come. When it came it looked great but I went to put it on my kitchen aid mixer and it was a bit to small. Just make sure your kitchen aid model fits this bowl . Other than that it was great.
5,Less Expensive than ANY WHERE,"I've always wanted a second Kitchen Aid Mixing Bowl, one for pie mix and one for meringue. I haven't used it yet but when I do I will be ready without having to wash out the first bowl to do the second chore. This is the least expensive price I have found for new and/or used Kitchen Aid Bowl on ANY site online...and FREE shipping."
1,Scam!,"I ordered this bowl for my mixer, and I recieved SANDER BELTS! Ace Hardware Outlet are complete scammers!"
1,Lousy Printer,"I bought this printer from Best Buy like one of the other users that placed a review about it. After about nine months, it gave me a printer head error message and is now a doorstop. I am tech savvy and was unable to fix this piece of junk. Not worth the $200.00 at all."
1,Kodak EasyShare 5500 is horrible,"The Kodak Easyshare 5500 is the worst printer ever created. The ink just evaporates in thin air. Cartriges just dry up and don't work. My favorite part is how you can't use any function on the printer when one of the ink cartridges are empty. Can't send a fax, scan photos into the computer, or use the memory card reader which is the most important function for me. Then nobody in town sells the cartridges. Not Office Max, and Office Depot hardly ever has them in stock. How lame. Their customer support is joke who just keep passing the buck. Spent at least 15 hours on the phone with them and they will not repair my printer even though I bought it direclty from them. They just keep blaming it on software issues..which is their software. DO NOT BUY. I'm crushing mine with a sledge hammer.thanks for reading"
4,"Printheads don't last long, but prints great","I bought my first 5500 over two years ago when they first came out to save ink. Kodak replaced the printhead free about three times in year 1. Year two has been better until now when another print head was needed. Again they ship free in 2-3 days. In the meantime we bought two others for the office. You can expect to replace the printhead about every six months on average. The Kodak tech said not to keep extras on hand because of a shelf life issue, so you will be unable to copy for a few days until the new one arrivesEven with this problem I'd still stick with it because it does make excellent prints, and cut our ink bill in half. We've had no problem with the scan or fax mode either. It's still nice to have a real fax machine available., otherwise documents have to be scanned into the computer first.Coupled with a MAC , which gives true color, it would be hard to beat."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. SHAME ON KODAK!!!!,"I purchased this printer after seeing all the commercials on TV that told me how much I would save on ink. WRONG! Did not work at all most of the time. Apparently, they have a defect but still choose to sell them anyway. After much time troubleshooting with customer service, they did send me a new print head which worked for about 6 months. Then, back to no printing at all. As for saving money on ink.... what a crock! Photo quality is the worst ever. My printer from 8 years ago produced a better photo. AND even though most of my printing is on ""draft"" quality in order to save ink, it tells me I'm out and must replace the cartridge. Yep, $20 color cartridge that is still heavy with ink. There is no override to keep going. It's like it's programmed based on the number of pages, not actual ink used. WORST PRINTER I HAVE EVER SEEN. (and I have spent 9 years as a secretary using many, many, many printers!)"
1,Do not buy this device! You've been warned!,"I can only echo all of the terrible experiences listed here... I won't enumerate the entirety all of my frustrations with this POS, but suffice to say I'm furious about the hours and hours on hold with clueless tech support; spinning in circles with software that didn't work and didn't play nice with my computer; garbage print quality, ink that lasts 1/10th as long as they claim; clogged print heads; promises from tech support to get back to me with a fix...etc, etc.Without question this was the most infuriating consumer product I have ever purchased......and, for the money, aggravation, time, trouble, and anger they have caused me, I hope once-mighty Kodak goes the way of ENRON.D. YoungTallahassee"
1,"Piece of junk, with junk consumables","I was persuaded to buy this product, in part, because of positive reviews on this site. Unfortunately, the initial color and black cartridges ran out in no time and did so simultaneously (although I almost never need/want to make color prints). I purchased refills at my local Wal-Mart in June . . . but the Kodak 5500 printer refused to recognize these brand-new color and black cartridges upon installation, ""reading"" them as empty in the information screen and refusing to allow the machine to function. Well, I purchased a second set of refills, same place . . . managed to get two months of occasional printing from them (I'm not a daily nor a heavy user). Today = crisis; the black cartridge is showing on the readout as two-thirds full, however, all my efforts to print simple one-page letters turn out totally blank. Junk, junk, junk."
1,peice of junk - dont buy it,"this printer is probably the worst purchase I have made. It always says the paper tray is out of paper when its not, you have to just push the ok button anyway to get it to print. the scanner always scans a 8.5x11 sheet at 8.5 x 14 with a big bright green band in the space between 11 inches and 14 inches. I bought it because the ink was supposed to cheap, but it runs out of ink all so quickly. And then it just stops printing way before there is any visible lack of ink in the prints, it just says ink low and I am not printing anymore untl you give kodak more money."
1,The worst....,"Horrible printer. I have only had the printer for 6 months and the scanner won't allow me to print the files that I scan. Every time I try to open the All in One program, the kodak image locks up on my computer so I can't even get into the program to use the features. Now the ink won't print on the paper even after changing the cartridges. I have also tried to download the new program they offer to help with the problems it is having and I can't even do that. My computer is not that old so it is not the computer I am using. I have contacted Kodak and have spent numerous hours talking to there support center and nobody can help me. I should have stuck with my 5 year old HP."
2,seems like it chould be a good printer,"I've had this printer for about 2 months now. and i can get it to print a normal page about once ever 8 pages otherwise it prints a shrunken version in the upper right hand corner of the page. other than the comedy factor of reading a 2 and a half inch tall Google map it is not very useful. Also there is no 64 bit version of the home software so i guess i don't get to use that...the system tray software just repeatedly pops up a window asking ""Photo paper tray?"" until you kill the process. also not terribly helpful.I also cannot update the software on this computer because it is connected over the network instead of through usb. very charming.Although it seems like a decent machine when it does work. It is obvious Kodak is not a software company. I don't understand how you can release a product seemingly without testing it, but i guess they figure people will be happy with happy paying for a doorstop while they figure things out."
1,GARBAGE!!!,Never again will I purchase anything remotely associated with KODAK. This was a total loss of $300.00 in all. Support you ask? What support? What a waste of time and money.
2,Don't waste your money!,"I have had this printer for a little over a year, spend around $200. The main reason for purchasing an ""all in one"" printer was the convince of scanning and e-mailing documents. Woke up this morning with some very important documents I had to scan and e-mail out, and my scanner stopped working. Not happy! Again I have only had this printer a little over a year! What a waste of money!! Off to purchase a new machine, will not be a Kodak."
2,Wouldn't buy this printer,"I'm not happy with this printer. The color prints look dull, not vibrant like they should be. It jams a lot, and prints come out crooked sometimes. It's a big disapointment, especially since it is such a pricey printer."
4,Great printer!,This all in one printer has been great so far. My only complaint would be that its a bit noisy. Its unbelievable how long the ink lasts and how inexpensive it is!
5,Fast Black & very good color printing,"Very nice printer! Me and my wife were both impressed with the detail of the 8X10 color photo I printed just to see how it would come out. Duplexer works fine. You can put your camera's memory card into the printer and download the pictures through it to your computer, which is nice. The printer is a bit on the noisy side but it works very well so no complaints from me."
1,Horrible product-Worse customer service,"I purchased the Kodak all in one 5500-from the first day I found it to be slow, and very noisy I asked for help-was told it was normal. It would freeze mid project, stop working...and finally Kodak sent me a new one. It didn't work at all. They sent me a third one...it is now non functional and I am in to the 4th week of waiting for product resolution from Kodak. I can't even get my money back because I don't have the original printer. Horrible, horrible....all THREE printers were bad...."
2,Buy at you're own risk,"I had to try 3 before I got one to work properly, Kodak kept replacing them until I got one to work, just aggravating waiting for one to arrive and calling and tellin g them it wo't work. I don't know how long this one will work. But is very easy to use, and prints great looking pictures faster than any I have had. Guess they will get all the kinks out soon."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!,This Kodak 5500 is by far the worst printer I have ever seen. I bought it in November and have had nothing but problems. I submitted a request to fix a problem in January and have yet to get any response or fix (even after sending them two files showing the problem). You have to clean the print head after about every 20 pages. The advertising is extremely false as to how many copies their cartridges get - it's probably only half of what they advertise. It's noisy and slow.I'm going back to HP!
1,Don't buy,"Just like many of the reviews on here, the ink use is a problem. I am a teacher, so I print a lot. Many times I only get 50 sheets printed for one cartridge of ink.The prints look good when all is working right, but unfortunately that is not often. Many times I print and it has lines through it. I have had many printers, but thishas been the most frustrating and costly of all. I wish I could take mine back!"
1,Please don't buy this printer!,"I bought this Kodak Easyshare 5500 thinking it will save me money (ink) but was I wrong! Did you know the printer stops working if ONE of the two ink cartridges are empty? The color cartridge only prints 20 copies before it runs out. I tried to run the printer on black/white ONLY but the printer would not work. I called customer service and they stated I need BOTH color AND b/w to operate the printer! What the !@#$ I have never heard of this before in ANY printer. Between that and the constant jamming of paper,fax issues and other small annoying habits of this printer...I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT for anyone. I would use HP or Cannon printers from now on. Unfortunately, I learned my lesson the hard way.Sincerely,MoeYork, PA"
1,Gary,"Print head problems, print head problems, print head problems. The whole reason for this printer was to reduce ink costs. The Kodak idea was to sell ink reservoirs and the print head remains in the printer. The problem with the concept is that the print heads wear out. Kodak, at the present time, does not sell replacement print heads. If you go through the laborious process of contacting customer service they will send you a new one along with some replacement ink ""cartridges"". They've done this for me 3 or 4 times. My question to them was why not sell the print heads as expendable supplies but they do not acknowledge that it is an expendable and don't have plans to sell them. I wanted to find out if, in fact, I would be saving money on ink if I had to buy the print heads.Saving money on ink would be the only reason to buy this printer. My $25 Lexmark has better print quality.In summary: it is poorly engineered and poorly executed. Buy something else."
1,Terrible Purchase,"I purchased the Kodak AIO 5500 a little over a year ago and it has proven to be the worst technology purchase I have ever made. Based on the (non) performance of this printer, I will never purchase another item made by Kodak again."
1,Avoid purchasing this piece of junk,"I purchased this printer thinking that I would save on ink cartridges. Little did I know that I would spend many precious hours trying to get the thing to print half-decent copies. As another reviewer mentioned, the printer will not work in any function if the cartridges are empty, even if all you want to do is scan, not print. The color copies are extremely poor quality and totally unacceptable, even in ""best"" mode.I've had this printer less than 6 months and have wasted much time trying to get it to work as advertised. I am in the market for a new all -in-one and will definitely pay attention to user reviews.If I could have given this printer zero or negative stars I would have!"
1,Cheap ink because you can't print.,"This printer has so many issues with the software that it is basically unusable. Right out of the box you will spend many hours of frustration until you call Customer Service at Kodak and they will send you more print heads. Then you will spend more hours messing around trying to get it to print. Once you actually get it to print, wow, not bad. Then the next time you turn it on it doesn't sound like it is trying to print on paper, but rather trying to MAKE paper. The noises and racket out this thing sounds like a garabage truck stuck in the mud at a pig farm. Then it won't print. Then it will only print in colors, not in black. Then you get error messages. Then you get really upset and buy another printer from HP so you can print. But at least Kodak has cheap ink. Too bad you will never be able to use it.Now for the software. I don't want to waste any more of my life on this printer. Only thing left to say is that it is terrible."
1,Kodak Printer,NEVER REcieced it and waited for weeks for it to come to find out they didn't have one. I was very upset and disappointed.
3,Will not print Adobe pdf files,My brother's 5500 will only print the last page of any pdf document in Adobe Reader 8 or 9. He has new iMac with latest version of OS 10.5. We have consulted Kodak's chat line and spent hours browsing for any type of solution. If you switch the documents to Mac PREVIEW they print fine.
1,Terrible Product,The print head has failed three times in the 18 months we have owned this printer. A low price and cheap ink do not make up for a printer that just flat out does not work.Do not buy this product. This printer stands out for all the wrong reasons. Lesson learned to stick with a manufacturer who understands the printer business. Kodak clearly does not.
1,If I had known I would not have bought it !!,"As soon as i received this printer I installed it and for less than 30 minutes it worked perfect, I was very pleased. And than suddenly after the 6th picture I printed I got an error messase saying that the printhead is not inserted or has come loose and to ""call service - Error 3809""I went on the internet to search for this error number and I found that many people that bought this item also had the same problem as soon as they started using it. If I had known I would not have bought it and loose my money. Now I have a lot of picture on my camera and no printer.KODAK should be ashamed to produce and sell a printer with this kind of problem !!!"
5,Great all-in-one printer,"I purchased the 5500 Kodak EasyShare printer three months ago, it replaced a HP 2175 printer. The HP cartridges were very expensive, plus the draft printing mode did not print up to par.I also had to change the HP 57 to a HP 58 cartridge just for printing photos. I have used everything on the Kodak except the fax mode, the two sided feature is great, the draft mode is just as good as the final mode on the HP, it scanned great and the pictures were A1. The Kodak cartridges cost aprox. $10 for black and $15 for color,it's a little less if you get the combo pack, and since I do a lot of printing this is a big savings. The Kodak cartridges last a lot longer than the HP's. The HP is a very good printer and it starts faster than the Kodak, but overall the 5500 is a better bang for the money.I only had one jam in three months and that was caused when I forgot I had two sided printing and reversed a one sided copy that had an edge that was curled."
1,Idiotic design,"The concept of a cheap ink, all in one machine sounds great. Unfortunately Kodak's design choices make this a lemon.The printing part is fine, but don't bother thinking you can use it as a fax machine or a scanner. Why not ? Well, it will do NOTHING if you run out of ink. No scan, no fax. Yes, at midnight with a deadline approaching, if you run out of ink the thing turns into a giant paperweight.The software that comes with it hangs my computer during set up. There is a hack around this on their website - you have to run a tool to clean the registry. OK - software update available it says. Yup - hangs the computer again - have to do a hard reset to recover.Kodak should stick to designing the paper and ink, and leave the software and product design to someone who knows what the heck they are doing."
5,Kodak 5500,I have used HP and Lexmark up until this purchase. The Kodak is superior to both the Lexmark 7100 all in one as well as the HP that was the backbone of my home office. In addition to rock solid operation it is twice as cheap to operate as the Lexmark and HP. The software is not as strong as the software that came with the HP or lexmark.
1,Me too,"Eats up ink. just replaced black cartage. Color cartage was half full, now with new black cartage the dam thing is binking a red light and saying I must replace the half full color cartage, it won't reset or anything. Had to unplug the damm thing to shut it off. looking for new printer and it won't be a Kodak. PS already replaced print head. This piece of junk cost to much to cause this much trouble."
2,The only printer that doesn't scan without ink!,"Yes indeed I am another unfortunate owner of a Kodak printer... Like everyone else I will NEVER buy a printer from Kodak again!I am a Digital artist and I bought this printer because I wanted something that can print beautifully, I also wanted a printer that would scan as well!Well this printer prints HORRIFICALLY in color! I find that this printer ONLY prints well BLACK/WHITE.This printer makes me waste A LOT of MONEY on INK, I have to buy cartridges more often than not!Though the printing sucks I give it a 2 star rating because of the way it scans. I will give you that kodak printer! It scans nicely in black and white and in color.BUT!!!! I NEVER heard of a printer that would not SCAN WITHOUT INK! Now tell me WHY do you need INK to SCAN?Well... Never again..."
1,Don't buy it!,Below is the message that I sent to KODAKYou have the right idea but you have yet to bring it tofruition. I just received my new 5500 AIO printer and setting it up wasfar from easy. I had to take out and reinstall the ink cartridges andprinter head at least 20 times because the printer wasn't seeing it.When it finally worked it was great. It also has a problem seeing thememory card from my camera. This is still ongoing. Friends of myparents got one of your printer's too and are telling me all of the sameproblems in their house. Tell your marketing department to shut thef*** up until you actually have a working product.
1,Kindle edition is only one song!,"Be aware that although there are two ""editions"" in the same box on this page and the Kindle edition is $3.16, it is only for the title song, NOT the book which is shown directly below it as though they are the same thing.Amazon, please correct this false advertising or make the entire book available in the Kindle format."
4,Very nice coffee table book,"A very nice book. I enjoyed the quotes about the ocean, the beach, etc. throughout the book. Pictures of the sand toys were very good; we have several of those shown. Would recommend it to beach lovers."
2,Soooo dissapointing...,"The premise of this book is great. The plot is great. What isn't great is how verbose this book is in places, and how mind-numbingly dry it is in others. There were about ten places in this book where I thought I'd never finish a page, just because of how tedious the writing had gotten. It's a shame too, because as I said before the plot is tremendous, the setting unique and interesting, and three out of the four characters were very well fleshed out and intriguing. The character of Nikki, however, takes the sails out of this narrative...there was no reason why the author needed this character in the book. My other main grievance is - not enough attention was given to the German sniper...this book could have easily benefitted from taking about fifty pages worth of dull descriptions, histories, and chapters and devoting them to Thorvald.Dissapointing, to say the least. Don't bother unless you're an absoulute WWII enthusiast."
4,"Riveting, but with a disappointing ending","I thoroughly enjoyed this book...for about the first 90% of it. The suspense of the battle between the two supersnipers, Zaitsev & Thorvald, was intense and compelling, even if you knew long before the climax how it would end. Unforunately, the denoument did not live up the the buildup. Another problem was the lack of followup on what happened to the main characters after the events in the book transpired. All in all, though, it was a very compelling read and I definitely recommend it to any who are interested in WW2 novels."
4,Some corrections,"A good read. If you don't know the history of the combatant subjects, the book could leave you a little anxious. Zietsev lived to survive the war and was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. The German Colonel, who's real name was Walter Konigs, was of course killed. Moments before he was shot by Zietsev, Konigs had killed a Soviet Kommisar who was accompanying Zietsev on his hunt for Konigs in the rubble of Stalingrad. This was a battle between two men that was being watched and cheered for by both sides. For a fictional account of this very real battle, I found this book extremely entertaining. A MUST read for any history buff of the Eastern Front Theatre of WW 2."
4,Hard work really does pay off.,"Bravo to Mr. Robbins for putting all that historical research into this book. I thought he successfully captured many of the more profound implications of Stalingrad while the various sub-plots unfolded.I found myself anxious to learn how the individual skills and personalities of the two snipers, Z and T, would result in one besting the other after a long, challenging duel. As it turns out, Z shoots T only after T fails to fire on Z, and after Z stupidly exposes himself as a result of the failed ""shell-casing"" trick. So, basically Z wins because his horrible blunder turned out to be less horrible than T freezing up and failing to fire his rifle.Z wins as a result of dumb luck, not skill. T loses because he failed to execute his greatest skill - firing quickly. An odd conclusion to the duel, but perhaps rather than dull writing, it is another example of Mr. Robbins analysis of Stalingrad - random, unmerciful destruction."
4,A sniper novel well worth reading,"I'll be brief, the book is excellent and the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that the author took a few real people like Zaitsev and mixed them with fictional characters to make a story. The story itself is superb and is set in the battle of Stalingrad where a Russian sniper, Zaitsev, is hunted by the Nazi super sniper, Thorvald. I'd have preferred fictional names throughout to avoid the reader believing certain incidents actually occurred when they didn't but otherwise this is an exceptional novel and so well researched that the reader should get a feel for what soldiers on both sides felt in the Battle of Stalingrad. The battle itself is well documented in a non fiction work titled, Enemy at the Gates for which the movie version of this book is named. My advice, buy the book, rent the movie, and don't expect them to match very closely. This book is by far the better of the two."
4,It could have been better,"In the book War of the Rats he wrote good but he didn't know anything about the weapons that were used. He say's ""And when **** got there the bullet went through the snipers scope. Everyone knows that shoots guns know that that would be an impossible. I give it a 4* rating."
3,Historic Duel,Fans of Stephen Hunter would not go wrong picking up this historical novel. The duel between the Nazi and the Russian drawn from the survivor's memoirs is highly readable. The horror of Stalingrad is captured for all to see. Good read.
3,"Good, but melodramatic and florid","The book has a very promising premise - war at its most primal reduced to the individual battle, plus the promise of learning about sniper psycholgy and tactics. But the florid and melodramatic prose just keeps overwhelming the narrative and the characterization. The German ""generic"" corporal, Nikki, the farm boy caught in the cauldron of Stalingrad, is done best but I found Tania, the American expatriate, to be the least compelling. Good book, but it shouldn't be compared to All Quiet on the Western Front or The Killer Angels."
4,"Great insight into human character, flawed understanding of","yeah, I love the book too. But on page 147, Robbins makes a huge mistake which calls into question all his research. He refers to Heinz Thorvald's .410 and 12 guage shotguns as ""rifles."" This is no mere verbal slip, as he does it repeatedly. As all gun enthusiasts know,a rifle and a shotgun are very different. I don't think Robbins is a shooter."
2,degenerates into soap opera,This book starts out extremely well.It appears to be a terse account of the battle of Stalingrad;One looks forward to a duel between two snipers and a gritty account of this horrific battle;however the female character is introduced and the novel takes a complete turn as if another author takes over the writing. It then becomes one of those literal romances without insight into the characters and any discernment or accounting of this historical tragedy.
2,Off target,"The disappoinment of the summer. I eager to read a fictionalized account of an extraordinary and riveting battle between two superstar snipers during the battle of Stalingrad. Instead, I got a slow-moving story with cardboard characters. This novel shouldda hit the bulls-eye. But it was off target. Way off target."
1,Looking for a romance novel? You've found it.,"The only action I saw between these two protagonist love birds was their love making. If I wanted a romantic novel I would have purchased Romeo and Juliet. So for me, a WW II history buff, this was a profound let down. I was only able to tolerate 15 chapters, and that is actually the MOST I have ever been able to handle in a book that is about 2 love birds. While I am at it I am going to torture my next door neighbor by giving him the book because he is a WW II buff as well. This book promises correct information about life in Stalingrad during WW II, but is a sadly incorrect (in many cases) depiction of a love story set supposedly in Stalingrad during WW II."
1,Grigor von Stiles,Too short on actual fact and way long on unreality. Stalingrad comes across more like the summer of love in San Fran in 1968 than the meat grinder it actually was. It was hard to finish as a historian.
4,Afterward?,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and although I was pleased with the outcome, the ending left me in a bit of a lurch. It was not clear as to whether Tania survived, and it would have been great to have been provided with some type of afterwards as to what became of Zaitsev and Tania."
2,War of the Rat's Enemies at the Gates,"It's always nice to see war novels use the Russian Front in World War II; especially the epic battle of Stalingrad. ""The War of the Rats"" is the book on which the screen play for ""Enemy at the Gates"" was based. The book is a reasonable portrayal of the horrors of war especially street to street fighting. The characterization of the Communist political officers, the German Gestapo and the high ranking officers on both sides are two dimensional and horribly predictable. The ""heroes"" are righteous, valiant, selfless and experts in their sniper knowledge domain. Both want to share their knowledge and generate clones of themselves.Sound formulaic and trite? You are correct. But, don't go to the movie for any relief. It is also formulaic, trite and has an unbelievably hokey love scene. If you want a really great war movie see ""Black Hawk Down"". If you want a great war novel of read ""Flight of the Intruder"". Do NOT bother with this book or its poor derivative movie."
3,Could have been better,"A missed opportunity to tell a truly great story. What's up with girl from America? Sell out! That said, I still enjoyed it, and recommend it."
3,Good but disappointing,"This book gives the reader a good feel for what was going on at the time it takes place. The author seems a little confused at times on things like the difference between an SMG and a machine-gun, or that not ALL German soldiers were Nazis (in fact, very few of them were members of the Nazi party). The book is definitely one which portrays the Germans as the ""Bad guys,"" and the Russians as the ""good guys."" I thought Grandfather's Tale: the Tale of a German Sniper was a lot better book about WWII snipers."
5,"Incredible, 5 STARS! *****","This is the only 'war' novel I own ... I have The Naked And The Dead by Mailer, but that's it. When I saw the movie, Enemy At The Gates, I was blown away by the sniper plot between Jude law and Ed Harris: if you felt the same, and loved that movie, get this book and read it right away.This is a factual novel, with some writer's guessing thrown in, but with clarity and just cause: a lot of this is documented in letters that survived the war, but there are some scenes in the book, conversations between characters, where the author has to use his own creativity, and he does it brilliantly.If you want a great plot, the sniper's hunt between each other, plus some great, powerful prose that puts you right in the fighting, then grab this one right away. You'll zip through the pages and make this a keeper on your bookshelf.5 STARS *****."
3,Great build up; poor follow through,"I enjoyed this book tremendously at first. The premise - a duel to the death between the two premier snipers available to the Russians and the Germans in the ruins of Stalingrad - held promise of an exciting story and grand climax. Unfortunately, the story seems to lose focus early on and limps to an unsatisfactory conclusion, leaving the fate of some of the characters unknown. I enjoyed the main characters, but felt that not enough was really done with them. Most of all, I missed a bigger sense of what was going on in Stalingrad. Granting that the duel between the two protagonists is the real story here, the 'stage' was sketched in with very little sense of the numbers of soldiers and the complexity of daily existence here.Ultimately, I just didn't feel that what I was reading was true. The story seemed pared down for effect, while the conclusion seemed more like a whimper than a bang. I was hoping for much more."
2,Sloppy research/editing on an otherwise good novel.,"For example, the Germans invaded Russia in June not July and to call a Stuka a fighter is really glorifying a rather pathetic airplane."
4,Better than 'enemy at the gates',"Same basic plot as the movie 'enemy at the gates' but much better -- no hokey love triangles here - a very well written thriller about an expert German marksman sent in to dispatch Russia's best sniper. I don't believe it is particularly historically accurate, but why should it be? It is historical fiction, and a great read at that. A solid, intelligent plot. If you have to choose between this and 'enemy at the gates' choose this!"
5,Intriguing!,I thought the author did a wonderful job of turning an event involving millions of men and women to something that revolved around only two men. He did a great job personalizing the war from a different point of view.
4,WOW! What a book!,"This is the 2nd best book I have ever read. The first book that I finish within 4 days. The excitment in this good is awesome. I love the way it starts but I didn't like the way it ended. Still, once you start, you won't be able to put it down!"
2,Enemy at the Gates movie is not based on this book,"I thought this book was fair. Overall some of the research seems questionable. One clarification to some of the earlier reviews. The soon to be released Paramount movie ""Enemy at the Gates"" is not based upon this book but upon the historical events. I am actually more excited about the soon-to-be published novel ""A Bend in the River"" that provides a more comprehensive account of these events. Some of the early hubub indicates that this work was much more thoroughly researched and hence provides and more exciting and realistic account of the events. War of the Rats just seemed a little too rushed and didnt really give you a good feel for the ultimate outcome of the Stalingrad campaign."
1,Stay Away,"If you know anything more about WW2 other than that it happened in the 20th century you should stay away from this book.It may seem ok for a few pages then starts to be more and more annoying with every scene. To give but one example, two russian and german groups are stuck in a building, in two different halls and the separating doors are locked. What to do? They both decide to dig a tunnel (!) underneath the room to the other side to blow up the enemy, and both start singing to cover the digging noise. ""Frightful"" suspense follows, until an explosion is heard in the night, and shortly afterwards, a russian song. I bet the author thought he came up with a masterpiece of suspense.Simply ridiculous. Stay away."
2,Skip this one...,"I enjoy historical fiction, but this book was barely tolerable. I'm not a gun/sniper freak, so the inaccuracies in that area didn't bother me.The cliches, bland description, and unoriginal characters killed the novel. Love in war is fine (See Wouk's War and Remembrance)-- but not under these circumstances."
4,Makes for interesting reading,"This book really gives some insight on what life what like during the battle for Stalingrad, albeit mostly from a Russian/sniper point of view. I didn't read it for technical accuracy. They have gun magazines and pamphlets for that. The one thing I found disappointing was that the author leaves you hanging as to the fate of the surviving main characters. I read somewhere else that Zaitsev was later blinded by a land mine."
4,A gripping romance and true-life adventure story!,"If you want to read a gripping romance and true-life adventure story I highly recommend David L. Robbins' War of the Rats. It stuns yet richly entertains in its detailed retelling of one of the grisliest battles of WWII: Stalingrad. We in the USA cannot imagine the horror of being locked in combat for months within the boundaries of one of our cities but the Russians lived it in Stalingrad. David Robbins tells the story as it must have been lived, with desperation, richness, horror, hope and hopeless despair. It is still unimaginable. But War of the Rats makes it visible in the mind's eye and thereby teaches the terrible lessons of war with fresh urgency. It takes skill to tell a story well enough to keep the reader interested when the ending is known. David Robbins has sufficient skill and more."
4,A GOOD NOVEL; SHAKY HISTORICAL BACKGROUND,"This book is an interesting novel that dwells about the individual struggle of two human beings,a german and a russian sniper, with totally different motivations and upbringing, against the background of an immense tragedy: the Battle of Stalingrad. For the general public, I would recommend it. However,the historical background is not accurate. The russian sniper's name (Zaitsev)should have been left out, because the man really was there, but using other weapons and doing other things."
4,Good War Book,"This book is mainly about a Soviet sniper who is basicly the best in the Red Army at Stalingrad (Volgograd). A German Sniper is sent from Berlin to kill him. This is the book of their duel. When I bought this book, I thought I would see mopre of the action at Stalingrad. Not just sniping. Sniping and some small raids is all you will see. That is why i took off 1 star. Other then that, the tale is told beautifuly. Although, the former Red Army claims it is a true story, ( They hung Zeitzv's rifle in Red Square), there is no record of the German Sniper, Heinz Thorvald, or his assiatant, Nikki Mond. I thought the addition of the character Tania Chernova was good, rather then bad, like many reviewers here say. She added emotion to the story, which is always needed in war books.Soviet propeganda, or true story? Since the breakup of the USSR, records were lost from the Battle. Overall I give this book 4 stars for its story, excitement, and its ending."
4,"A real, gritty read about one of history's greatest battles","This book was excellent! I couldn't put it down, and have been faithfully reading it since I bought it. The story really makes you feel the hardships that the soliders faced in the hell that was Stalingrad. It's a literary Saving Private Ryan in that it leaves you shell-shocked. The fact that the story is true only makes it better. Robbins shows that a hunter's true instinct and heart were the tools that these warriors had to hone on the battlefield. Zaitsev is a super-sniper, but Robbins shows that he is also a man who shows honor in his occupation. Thorvald is the opposite, the other side of Zaitsev's coin. He has the skill, but not the heart, of a hunter. An excellent read, and I'll recommend this book to everyone I know."
5,Read this book soon. Tell your friends!,The Nice thing about David Robbins is that he's young. We can look forward to lots of strong reading in future. He only gets better! Thanks Mr. Robbins! Thanks for a great read!
3,Sniper duel in Stalingrad,"This book was a nice easy read, however, the author needs to do some research on the weapons, I really doubt the Germans prefered the Moison-Naigant to the K-98 Mauser. Also I thought the German sniper's name was Koinigs or something like that, not Thorvald. Does any one know his name? Anyway its a good book for a long flight."
4,A reader from South Carolina,"I found this historical novel interesting enough to both read the hardcover and listen to the unabridged tape version. I did find the novel flawed, though, due to the lack of explanations as the absence of other German ground forces and the Luftwaffe during the critical Hare(Russian)/Headmaster(German SS) sniper duels."
1,Not worth your time.,"Did anyone else feel like the book was just really really tacky? I mean, aside from the dialogue apparently being lifted from a book on phonics? Hares and bears, a chorus of ""O Tannenbaum"" rising over Stalingrad on Christmas, Thorvald and his sandwiches. Gag.David Robbins clearly has no knowledge about war or Russia. But that's irrelevant because he's got no business writing novels at all. With his grace, he ought to be writing manuals for electric powered toothbrushes.A small note, despite the risk of sounding like a Russia dweeb: the diminutive name Vasha does not exist in Russian. The main character's name is Vasily, the diminutive should be Vasya. ""Vasha"" is the feminine for ""your,"" as in, ""I throw your book in the trash.""I know, I know, it's nitpicking, but imagine if some author had a character named Robert and went through an entire book calling him ""Berb."" Sounds a little weird."
3,War of the Rats,"After wandering through 50 or so Reader Reviews[I won't take the time to read all 180],I was struck that no one knows[or at least cares], that a .410 is a shotgun.Aparently,Mr Robbins is not much for blood sports,nor are his Editors.I actually found the book reasonably enjoyable.Unfortunately,an error like the .410""rifle""makes me suspect the author's accuracy for the rest of the Book."
5,Excelent,"This book is nothing short of amazing. Unlike the majority of other war books I've read, this one is devoid of any and all of that Hollywood garbage. As far as its depictions of the warfare itself that is. Somewhat peculiarly, while the warfare itself is as vivid as it is believable, the characters, and their interactions with one another, could've been taken straight from any stereotypical action movie **cough** tenia **cough**.Also, though I wouldn't want to spoil anything, I will say the ending is climactic, but, overall, somewhat of a letdown.Nitpicking aside though, from an entertainment perspective, if you enjoy war books, you'll definitely like this one."
4,High Marks for Pure Entertainment Value,"For pure entertainment value, ""War of the Rats"" merits high accolades. It is highly engaging and suspenseful, and the snipers' duel provides compelling narrative. (I agree with previous reviewers who complained about the sexual interludes -- unnecessary, superfluous and wholly unrealistic.)Regardless of whether this duel ever happened (historian Antony Beevor, in his classic history ""Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege"" says it did not), the book was more than worthwhile."
2,I was expecting more ...,"I was disappointed with this book. At times I felt I was reading two different novels: One a love story during WWII (a poor Danielle Steele) and the second a military duel between the two primary antagonists.I'm not sure why the author decided to stick a love story in this novel. He seemed to be doing fine when he stuck to the military aspects of the story but then that love storyline would rear its ugly head and screw things up. I didn't find it all that difficult to believe some of the lines/thoughts the author attributed to the main combatants during the military confrontations, but the love story angle was just silly.My recommendation: If you're interested in this particular part of history, look for a history book. If you need to read this book, borrow it from a friend or from the library. Finally, if you absolutely need to buy it, purchase the paperback version and save some $."
2,"So much potential, so little delivery...","I read quite extensively (mostly classics, scientific and sci-fi/fantasy) and was looking for an intense story with colorful (and not so colorful) depictions of a gritty world filled with gritty people. Instead this book has all the drama of newspaper clipping with half the details. The duel was quick and anti-climatic and the romance was a complete yawner. Actually, it was annoying. The characters were the mere shell of a stereotype.And here I am searching the web for what happened to these two historical figures, these ""heroes of Russia"" (since the book didn't tell me) and I'm finding nothing. Sigh..."
3,Drinking vodka and shooting ?,"Quite intense novel and it reads well. It gives a good idea about how bloody and cruel was fighting between Russians and Germans on the Eastern front around Volga River in 1942. Hundreds of thousands soldiers died just because two evil politicians (in this case Hitler and Stalin) set their minds on Stalingrad city and did not want to give up.Maybe there are better books and novels about urban warfare and life in a cities tormented by fighting; I recommend learning about September 1944 Warsaw Upraise. That is why this book was not something extra revealing to me. However, I would still recommend ""War Of The Rats"" to the young Americans on continent that was not directly affected by WWII.And finally, descriptions of Russian snipers drinking constantly vodka and aiming with deadly precision are not quite credible to me. The author must be exaggerating one or the other."
1,Never Happened,"Although a good read, the Author neglected to mention that the sniper duel between Zietsev and Konigs was nothing but Soviet propaganda and never happened."
4,Misleading title that kept distracting me to the very end..,"""War of the Rats"" proves that one should not judge a book by its title. Initially I had no interest in the book, then someone, who knew of my interest in cultures, told me it was about dueling snipers at the Battle of Stalingrad. With this new frame of reference I found the book riveting, tight, tense, and culturally insightful about the differences between Germans and Russians which are still true today. The ending was weak, flat, and written to justify the misleading title. Too bad: an ending for a book alternatively titled ""War of the Snipers"" or ""War of Wits"" would have worked better and been much more gratifying.Josh Hammond, co-author, ""The Stuff Americans Are Made Of."""
1,talentlessly written,"This was one of the most poorly written books I've read in a quite some time. The characters are poorly developed, and the plotline is constructed on a shifting pile of cliches. Very formulaic and trite. I would not bother reading anything else by this author....."
2,Couldn't even finish it...,"Although the book came highly recommended, I found that I stalled reading it about half way through. I found the characters to be one-dimensional and the storyline dragged on and on. Maybe it was just me... However, the book Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942 - 1943 by Antony Beevor was all that War of the Rats was not -- fast paced with plenty of insight into the minds of soldiers who fought, and their military leaders. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in WWII military history."
4,"Dated, Exhaustive, Exhausting","Oman wrote this as a follow-on to his History of the Art of Warin the Middle Ages (q.v.), and gave it his usual opinionated all.Some of it shows its age, now, but nevertheless it's essentialif you're studying either the sixteenth century in general orthe rise of modern warfare.I get particular pleasure out of Oman's digs at his sources;despite drawing from him frequently, he really, really doesn'tcare for poor old Blaise de Monluc (which Oman and hiscontemporaries insist on misspelling ""Montluc."") Anyway,buy the book if you're nostalgic for the old-style, ""decisive""school of military history, from the pre-Keegan era."
1,Sticky wheel,"Watch out if you buy the mouse 6000. The wheel on my mouse has gotten progressively harder to turn over the year I have been using it.I finally tried cleaning/lubricating the wheel with eyeglass cleaner and BreakFree CLP. It helps for a minute, then it is back to dragging.I believe the wheel is rubbing on something in the housing. The wheel tries to do too much: tilts to side and depresses for clicks. I have two cheeper models which are a pleasure to use compared to this one. For $70.00 bucks I should not be looking to replace it.Ken"
4,Exciting,Very good so far. I will read the complete set. I'm looking forward to the next book in line. Keep them coming.
5,KitchenAid Mixer Attachment Pack,Delivery through Amazon is flawless as usual. Quality is Superb as is all KitchenAid products I own. Delivery is great from supplier.
2,Great combination,The mixer attachment pack worked perfectly on my kitchen aid. The package was shipped promptly and in retail packaging. I used the grinder to process vegetables from the garden.
2,"todo llego en perfecto estado, pero me falto una pieza","las piezas llegaron en perfecto estado, pero me falto una pieza (el palo de madera que sirve para empujar la carne en el molino)¿como hago para que me lo envien? por lo desmas todo bien"
1,? graphite coming in to the food as I grind it,I was wondering is this normal for the graphite to be oozing out into the food that I am grinding?
5,Cheryl's kitchenAid Attactments,"I tried all three, grinder, juicer and slicer, and it was a breeze, they all work so well. Made the job easy and fast. I love them all."
5,Kitchen Aid,I purchased this accessory kit to enhance the Kitchen Aid mixer. Just got done using the meat grinder part to make ham salad. This thing is awesome...nice and quiet.
5,Great Accessory Pack,"How did I live without it? I highly recommend these accessories, I almost use them every day! The Cheese grater is my #1 Fav!"
5,Attachments,This item was a great price and it does exactly what it says it will. I love my KitchenAid mixer and attachments.
4,Good deal and fast shipping too!,"I recently purchased this on Amazon and I received it by UPS the following day! These attachments are very handy. I have tried them all and they serve their purpose, however, I prefer my KitchenAid 12 cup food processor over the slicer / shredder attachment included in this package. My food processor has much sharper blades and I think it does a much better job.I really wish that KitchenAid still made these attachments out of metal instead of plastic. This is the second set I have owned because the first set I had developed a crack right where it hooks onto the mixer. I know that this is a common problem because I have seen these for sale on ebay and many of them have the crack(s) in the same location."
3,Decent and functional,"Decent package of items, and definitely worth the price. I only gave it 3 stars, though, because I find it rather cumbersome to take the attachments and clean them. They work fine, but get a little messy when you use them. Still, nice to have them from time to time."
4,Making Your Kitchen Aid Really Fun!,"We have had a blast making unusual meat and sausages, as well as fast veggies in unusual ways with the great kit!Even if you have a KitchenAid on your counter, you have a fraction of the capabilities until you get this kit. Really great Xmas gift for a concerted cook.And a great price at Amazon... I checked around."
3,Mixed bag,"I got this to help me maximize the usefulness of my KitchenAid Pro Mixer. I love the grinder and the strainer, but I have real issues with the slicer/shredder. The blades do not seem to be sharp enough to handle most produce and I have had one slicing cone go all rusty after its first use, despite the fact that I rinsed it thoroughly right after use before I put it in dishwasher. So, I don't know what you are supposed to use it for. Shredding cheese?"
4,Everything in a box,Attachments work and stay in place. Haven't found a way to slice veggies except very thin even when using the coarser cone.
1,bought a pricy kit,"Sausage stuffing kit - sweetjuicing kit - okslicing kit - really weakthey just are not sharp, it would have been less work to weld knives to a car tire then cut carrots that way.I've said my piece."
4,Kitchen Aid Attachment package,"Received package in a very timely manner. The part that removes the skin and seeds is what we needed ... and it works wonders for making tomato juice. We actually had fun sing it. Haven't used the rest of the stuff, 3 grinders. After getting this it looks like all I would need to make spaghetti is a set of strainers.Very nice product."
5,EASY & CONVENIENT,"I love the attachments that go with the Kithchen Aid Stand Mixer. The are easy to attach and to take off and clean. They work well - the machine is very powerful. I haven't used the sausage maker yet but for those of you who do intend to use it also remember to buy the tips for it. They are inexpensive (and should come with the attachments, but don't) and are a must.And what a great price!!!"
1,disappointment,"ordered by description, but box didn't contain pasta attachments the reason for the purchase"
2,This is made with cheeper metals,When we opened this to use we shocked to feel how the metals have changed. They are very light and they can't go into the dishwasher without damaging the metals. Disappointed!
5,Best Attachment Ever . . .,"Initially this purchase was made to puree the annual tomato crop. This has been hugely successful with jars of puree preserved for the coming year. Easy to set up, use and clean up it just doesn't get any better than this. The grater attachment was put to good use grating excess Zucchini and Squash from the vegie patch and frozen for later use. Looking forward to trying a few other things out.KitchenAid FPPA Mixer Attachment Pack for Stand Mixers"
2,Basically doesn't work,"I got this for making applesauce, and it doesn't: the main problem seems to be that the auger doesn't go all the way back, so part of the material gets behind it. That probably doesn't matter so much if it's soft material, but something firm like an apple basically plugs up the feed tube so you can't get more in."
5,Still haven't used,I bought these to go along with the mixer a year ago. I wouldn't recommend buying them unles you realy plan to use them. Takes up a lot of drawer space in kitchen.
2,Not a lot useful stuff in it,The slicer/shredder:I find the slicer doesn't work good. If you want to shredd a cabage or potatoes for a meal there is a lot garbage produced until you are ready. The grinding plates are very dull and you need to use a lot preasure to get the job done. I should have returned it!The fruit strainer:Is producing a mess and very bad to clean! Would not buy it again! I'd rather try a manual one!The grinder: Good for small jobs. Tried sausage making with it. Took two people and more than 4 hours to process and stuff the casings with it. Okay to clean.Overall: To me a waste of money and cupboard space!
5,Kitchen Aid Attachment Bundle,"I love the used kitchen aid I bought, but wanted to do more with it. The bundle of accessories I purchased from Amazon was the right price and of the highest quality. I am extremely pleased."
5,really professional,"It really neat to work with this Kitchen aid. It's silent and stable, no working around. You can also put a lot of flouramount in it. simple and easy to handle all the supplies."
4,Love the Grinder -Check parts list against package!,"Love the grinder (which is the main feature I was looking for), but it arrived without the wood pusher. When I contacted Amazon, their only option was to return the entire kit, which I didn't want to do. They suggested I contact KitchenAid directly. Worked out great, they sent me the pusher at no cost, it arrived within a week. Haven't used the other attachments yet, but they look fine. The grinder works like a charm! Highly recommend."
5,Great Product and Super Fast Shipping,As usual the product is great and the shipping extremely fast! The Kitchenaid stand mixer attachment pack is made well and is easy to use. I have some large gatherings here and look forward to using it alot. Thanks for a great price and quality!
5,More than I expected!,"Quite a heavy box, but when opened, you can see why! Everything as expected except the rotating slicer which was twice the size of the one you get here in the UK! All fits together perfectly as expected from Kitchen Aid and instructions are clear. Oh, and SO much cheaper than over here!"
5,A must have!,I love my KitchenAid mixer and these attachments make me love it even more! A must have for any job in the kitchen. They are so versatile!!!
4,Lots of work made easy,The strainer-grinder works magic. We have a large tomato crop each year ( 15-20 bush)and put up many jars of salsa and sauce. This device makes hours into minutes.
5,Fantastic!,"This product is so easy to use. It was a little confusing to put together, but once you do, you realize that the picture in the manual shows you it spread apart and then you piece it altogether. Also, we purchased two other attachments at the same time, so we were looking at multiple parts!!! I have done a lot of tomatoes with this and my 3 yr. old loves being the pusher!! I load it and he shoves them through. You do need to keep the strainer cleared and moving down the slope; however, this is typical of all strainers of this type. I do suggest this attachment if you do a lot of canning."
5,Dream Machine,Have wanted one of these for years and now it's finally here am not disappointed. Am working my way through recipes and loving it. The Rolls Royce of kitchen appliances.
4,"Misnomer, but still good","When I purchased this book, I was expecting something along the lines of a a player's guide or such. What I got, on the other hand, was a sourcebook chock full of information on supernaturals around the world. Be careful that you know what this is before you purchase it. It's an excellent book and I liked it very much, but it was not what I had in mind for a survival guide."
4,"Good book, full of potential story ideas.","I liked this book. Its written from the point of view of the hunters, a different one for each section. The book does not have any game mechanics, its pure story. It begins with a few tips for novice hunters, something you should get your players to read through. Then it goes on to describe each continent. It spends a lot of time discussing the world outside of North America, so if your planning on running a game in a different country then this is the book for you. I liked the fact that since the information is given out by hunters, it is full of various facts that are completely not true, so your players can read through the book and still not have any of the real information. Full of great story potential and well written. A good buy if your going to run a hunter's game."
3,This book might help you build a decent chronical.,The Hunter game is a nice addition to anyones WoD collection. This book can help one to build better characers. You know onesa that can actually live for past 60 seconds.
2,An Essential Jazz Album,"Ellington, Basie bands, arrangements by Quincy Jones, and players at the top of their form make this a unique meeting which makes one regret they never repeated it. I can't convey the beauty of the sound in words. The fact that these tunes were recorded in one session, which started late at night and ran until dawn, gave the player's an urgency to do their best, impress their leader and their peers and every recording shines with this feeling. Basie's theme, ""Jumpin' At the Woodside"" and Ellington's ""Take the 'A' Train"" are both included, though Billy Strayhorn, Ellington's musical partner, and the song's composer, takes the Basie piano on ""Train."" There's even a drum battle in the first tune ""Battle Royal."" But unlike 'battle of the bands' meetings of the past, this is more of a melding of the sounds of the two bands. It may be impossible to say what is the best big band album. This would have to be on any top ten list, however."
4,Works as advertised.,The old cell phone battery was on it's last legs. Had to recharge every 24 to 36 hours. The new battery last at least twice that. Depending on talk time that is.
1,"HEY WHAT""S UP WITH THIS!!!!! THIS ISN'T JOHN WAITE, YOU MORONS!!","THIS IS NOT JOHN WAITE....JOHN WAITE IS HOT HOT HOT!!AND THIS GUY IS DEFINATELY NOT NOT NOT!!!WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS!!THIS IS A VERY YOUTHFUL PAUL YOUNG NOT THAT GORGOEOUS MAN JOHN WAITE,HOW COULD ANYONE MISTAKE THOSE TWO, IT'S LIKE NIGHT AND DAY!!THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO GET ITS S*^% TOGETHER!!I THINK YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO JOHN..THAT WAS A SLAP IN THE FACE!!NOT TO MENTION THAT PAUL COULD ONLY WISH HE COULD SING 1/2 AS WELL AS JOHN...PAUL SOUNDS LIKE HE'S GOT A HEAD COLD OR SOMETHING..HEE HEE!!IF YOU EVER SEE THIS JOHN, JUST KNOW THAT I AM ATRUE DEVOTED FAN WHO REALLY LOVES YOUR MUSIC ABILITY!!!

5,Beautiful and functional,"I'm a big guy and as a result, my bikes tend to be heavy. But one look at the King Cage Titanium and I had to have it. In fact, I bought two (from BentUpCycles in North Hollywood), and if they'd had more, I probably would have bought them, as well. The design is simple, elegant, and well-executed. Then there's the weight ... or lack thereof. There's nothing quite like titanium. (Sigh.)Thank goodness I have an understanding wife, as owning these two cages compelled me to buy a new bike on which to mount them."
5,The best alloy cage you can get.,"Very light. Feels weightless. Holds the bottle snugly. You can bend it to make it hold the bottle more or less tight. If you want the best alloy cage you can get, this is it. People will ask if that is a King Cage. You can proudly reply yes."
4,"Bad ""feature""","For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
4,Page shines in an otherwise bland adaptation,"Being my favorite Williams play, I was disappointed overall with this adaptation, with one exception: Geraldine Page as Alma Winemiller is amazing, recreating the stage performance that brought her fame in 1952. A consummate piece of artistry, Page's performance is the sole reason to watch this film. Laurence Harvey fades into the background, even with the extra material given to his character. Supporting players are, for the most part, weak, with exceptions granted for Rita Moreno (who deserves more screen time) and Una Merkel."
3,Detached,"A good film, but with too little emotional depth. Page is too old and too low-key for the role of Alma. Harvey is good, except for his overdone accent. It's a shame that Glenville couldn't direct them to be more emotionally affecting."
4,Evocative a Timeless !!,"Tennessee Williams was a genius. Hal Wallis has assembeled some fine artist for this film. This is Geraldine Page,s great performance and it has been noted so. The film allows closeups and the viewer can drink all the emotions of the characters..something that cannot be done on the stage. Looking even closer one must not leave out the performance of Laurence Harvey as doctor John Buchanan. His detachments hold a stark contrast for the rest of the characters in the film.. A vital element for Alma in this tragic riddle. Elmer Bernsteins score frames the film with a meloncholy air...it,s superb !!"
5,"Works great, aid for itself!","I bought one of these for every car we own because they are small and can be stored easily. I came back from a trip and went to my car in the airport parking lot only to find I had a dead battery. I flagged down another motorist for help and in 2 minutes I was up and running. easy to use, never need to raise the hood of the car where the dirt lies."
1,Do not like it at all,"This product did not work for me. It wouldn't stay in the charger in the car, kept coming out. This did not charge the car at all. I didn't feel like going out to send it back with the trouble of packing it back up and wasting my gas going to the post office."
1,Less than worthless,"I tried this product on several occasions. It failed each time to start the car. A piece of junk. Having paid very little, I still did not get any value for my money."
3,bowl covers,"They are fine. They arrived in good shape, I can't wait to use them. Thankyou for sending them so quickly. Karen"
2,Didn't fit my bowl,"I have the 5 qt bowl and bought this set for my sister that has the smaller bowl. The bigger ones fit mine perfect, but they were too small for hers. The smaller size certainly didn't work for her smaller bowl as good as the bigger one did for my bowl."
5,Kitchen aid bowl covers,"Bought these items and several other accessories along a Kitchen Aid Artisan stand mixer for my daughter as a christmas gift, and she loves them. I did what several other reviewers suggested and cut out the hole in the center of the second cover in order to use it as a splatter guard while mixing, since you really don't need two lids unless you purchase a second mixing bowl. They're not air tight but the fit well, convenient for keeping ingredients from drying out while baking. Would definitely recommend this product for anyone with an Artisan stand mixer by KA."
3,They work.,"Well, they work, and will keep food fresh while being stored in the refrigerator, and keep the bowls clean while in storage. One note, they seem to be overpriced for what you get."
4,classic kitchenaid utilitarian design,"I didn't buy these for food storage - I bought them so I could keep my attachments inside the mixer bowl on the counter, without them getting covered with grease and coffee grounds. For that purpose, these lids are perfect.The center well looks odd, but it's just the right depth to clear the mixer shaft when the lid is on the bowl on the mixer, and almost the right width to allow two covered bowls to be stacked and stay stable (the base of the top bowl goes into the well in the bottom bowl's lid - the fit is a little tight, but still works).The lids lost a star because I washed one of them in hot water in the dishwasher (on the bottom rack), and it shrunk slightly. It still goes on the bowl, but it strains to fit. I believe the instructions say ""top rack"" dishwasher safe, so you could chalk this up to user error, not necessarily to bad design."
3,cover too big,"The lid is of the same quality as the original one; very nice. However, it is just a tiny bit too big to snap tightly onto the bowl."
3,Didn't fit as snug as the original.,"Even though this is the right lid for my Kitchenaid model, they don't fit as tight as the original. Also the indent in the middle is probably twice as deep as the original. Mind you, my original one was about 16 years old."
5,What a Great Idea,"These are wonderful. I was never able to leave my bowl with my Kitchenaid pivot head mixer, which is on the counter, because of dust. I now not only have the bowl in place, but I store the dough hook, wisk and beater blade inside. I store my extra bowl in a cabinet with the second lid on top of that to keep the dust out. The indentation in the center of the lid accepts the 'stem' from the machine just perfectly."
5,who is the father,you want to know who is GOD THE FATHER then read this book you will get to know HIMBOOK IS VARY VARY GOOD PEACE TO ALL.
2,I missed the flying spider monkeys,"What can one say about a book in which the main battles are won by bulldogs and sealions with magnetic mines. I never could get serious about this book. Why two stars, read a whole lot of AH books that were much worse! Its readable if you have nothing better to do but be prepared for war winning bulldogs and sealions. I was expecting parachuting spider monkeys to appear at the end. Sorely dissapointed!"
2,its ok,"not painted well, tiny even though right gauge, very cheap looking figures.iI would not recommend these figurines. Painting or whatever looks terrible"
3,Ra! Ra! Ra!... Hiss Boo Blah!,"In writer/director Roland Emmerich's quite silly sci-fier STARGATE, crewcut-sporting Kurt Russell and a small military contingent use a galactic portal to pass from Earth to another world resembling ancient Egypt, where people are slaves to the human god Ra.Oscar-nominated for packing a concealed weapon inTHE CRYING GAME(1992), Jaye Davidson here plays a girly Sun God. On the last day of shooting, the mercurial Davidson, who refused to remove body piercings for this picture, stripped naked on the set to escape the regal costume he so despised, and walked away from the movie industry. To date he hasn't again appeared in a feature film.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.7) Stargate (France/USA-1994) - Kurt Russell/James Spader/Alexis Cruz/Viveca Lindfors/Jaye Davidson/John Diehl/French Stewart"
5,Relax and have fun with the tough questions!,"I first bought this book when I was pregnant for my second child. My daughter was about three at the time and I wanted to make sure she had an understanding of the ""miracle of childbirth"". This book took away the pressure! Great photographs and a clear and factual explanation of how babies are conceived and develop. I loaned this book out to one of my friends and unfortuantley never got it back. My daughter is now 9 and will still mention how she loved that book and wishes she had it back! This is a must for anyone with a new baby on the way or to handle that tough question of, ""Where do babies come from?""!"
3,book,this book was full of good information but it has 3 mistakes in it for example it sent you to a bible verse that didn't match the subject..
2,Living a Life of Balance,I was disappointed with this study in comparing with others my Bible Study group has done. The lessons were short and lacked depth. I will probably not order another one.
3,Fine Bible Study book,"We bought this book as a group of friends that wanted to do a Bible study together. Enjoyed the book but didn't wow us. Some of it seemed redundant and not 100% clear with the Biblical references.Glad we did the book, but wouldn't necessarily recommend. The trinket theme was cute though and it's an easy read. :-)"
3,Beginner's study,this women's Bible study is a good one but i felt it was geared more to the beginner in Bible studies. I prefer my studies be more in-depth in the Word and less about ourselves as the focus..
2,Not so good,"I did not enojoy this study. Every single question in the book has a scripture to look up with it, some have several scriptures. I enjoy getting in the word, but all i feel like i am doing is turning pages."
4,Nice for a change,"First of all the battery is included and installed, that's nice. Refreshing experience. Much like the treatment you get when you go in for professional cleaning."
4,it lasted a month before show wearing,"maybe because I ordered a ""medium"". It works fine otherwise. I recommend it."
4,Date for Replacement Disk correction,Thanks for the phone number to call to replace Disk 1. I got a live person (I was expecting a message machine) and got same speech over the phone except they said it will be out in November 2004. I ask them to double check and they said that would be the date. If anyone gets another date I would appreciate a post.
5,A Fat Guy Explodes,"In one of the scenes, a fat guy explodes. What more do you need to know? Watch this movie! I would like to get one of those machines that go ""bing!"""
2,AUGH!,"CALLING ALL MONTY PYTHON FANS... Monty Python are comic gods. I have seen all their episodes and each movie as well. And let me tell YOU... What a comedown for the group! This movie is an utter disaster. I saw this for the first time with a bunch of fans, and we were all disappointed. It just wouldn't end! We thought it was so bad that it's now a joke for us. First of all, there is very little funny material. Here I outline the film's few highlights- the machine that goes *bing!*, ""Where's the fish?"", the organ donor, and possibly the angel of death scene. The rest isn't that amusing, and some scenes are utter drivel- ESPECIALLY the fat man exploding (revolting) and the ""every sperm is sacred"" song (We ALL thought it was childish, including the guys). I've read the reviews here and I don't mean to offend the zealous fans of this movie (and of what we thought were the worst parts). However, I have to warn people that if they're looking for great Monty Python, they'll be sadly disappointed."
1,python's worst film,"They obviously ran out of ideas by the time this flick was made. The only funny sketch was the Mr.Creosote one. The rest, especially the one about birth control, were so tedious as to almost make me walk out of theater. Oh, by the way, I'm a huge Monty Python fan. Loved their tv series. I've been watching a different segment every day for the last three months. And The Holy Grail was one of the funniest films ever made. But this film is one of the unfunniest flicks ever made. Skip it."
1,Do not buy! Universal is distributing a faulty product...,"The rating given reflects the new special edition DVD, not the film. Disc number 1, which contains the movie, is corrupt and the image is blurry. This makes most of the movie unwatchable and makes the viewer dizzy. I've owned the VHS version for over 10 years, and the video quality on it is still much better than this new DVD edition. The surviving members of Monty Python and their fans deserve better than this. Universal Home Video owes their customers an apology, and Amazon.com should stop selling this product until a recall is issued so the discs can be replaced."
5,Equal Opportunity Offenders.,"M-P manage to offend virtually everyone in this movie. My Catholic step-mother blew a gasket when she saw the ""Every sperm is sacred skit"". Almost broke the DVD player. Didn't talk to me for a month. That alone was worth the price of the DVD. This movie is M-P on steroids."
3,Many disjointed skits not up to snuff,"Did you ever want to know what it is all about? NOUnfortunately, they just do not get off the ground. Python is known for being wired provocative and in many cases cutting edge. Regrettably, they missed the mark on this one. One or two skits may strike your fancy but you have to wade through the rest to get to it.However if you like sex, violence, blood, and debauchery, could care less the fact that they have nothing to do with the absent plot, you could find this film interesting.And Now For Something Completely Different"
2,Enjoyable At Some Parts But Just Plain Stupid In Others,What i mean by the title of my review is yes this movie is going to be funny its Monty Python! but there is also some parts where it just really gets out of hand in my mind. If you are new to Monty Python I would get the quest for the holy grail before this one. Also the Monty Python's Flying Circus is great too. It comes in a 16 DVD set so it will give you a lot of their old stuff. I really did not enjoy certain parts. But there is a few good moments.
2,same problem with transfer quality,"The movie and the features are great, but the transfer on my copy is also horrible. Do not buy this. I thought at first that there was something wrong with my DVD player, but it was definitely the movie. Sadly, the problems last throughout the entire movie. Huge disappointment."
1,Unwatchable,"First off, I LOVE this movie. It's one of my all time favorites and I couldn't wait for its release. However, I have never seen such a bad transfer onto a DVD. It takes away from the movie itself and makes it unwatchable. TV and VHS showings of this put the dvd to shame. I couldn't bring myself to finish watching it. I took it back to the store (blockbuster) and they were kind enough to let me look at their remaining 2 copies in store. They were both messed up as well. I guess anyone wanting a real copy of this will have to stick to VHS copies for now."
4,A CLASSIC LOOKING GOOD!,"IVE JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS ON HD-DVD, IM NOT A BIG FAN OF MONTY PYTHON BUT DO FIND THE FILMS VERY FUNNY AND I THOUGHT ID BUY THIS ONE AND SEE HOW IT GOES ON THE HD FORMAT.....SURPRISNGLY ITS VERY GOOD BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE FILM IS QUITE OLD BUT THE PICTURE QUALITY IS GOOD NONE THE LESS!"
3,Not the Best Python,"I would suggest doing to things before buying this dvd. First, see the movie to make sure you like it. It has some of the most disgusting moments in Python's history. Some of it is absoulutly hilarious, but not all of it is that funny. Secondaly, don't pay to much for it. The movie itself isn't that amazing, but in my opinion it is worth having; but the DVD has literly no special features. The only thing on there besides the movie istself is a chapter list."
3,Outrageous Censorship,"While I enjoyed the disc overall I was appalled by the blatant censorship in the second song sequence taking place in Yorkshire. There is not the blink of an eye at mocking Catholics, Buddists, Protestants or Jews the disc blanks out a twenty-second portion of dialogue which refers to Muslims. It is obvious that the terrorists have won and more's the shame."
3,Fab moments worth the boring intervals,"One general fact of life with Monty Python is that, while their sketches are side-splitting, their full length features tend to drag. Some spots of this film are boring, others beyond the boundaries of even the bad taste of us Python fans. But the moments that are hilarious are first rate - I defy anyone not to fall on the floor laughing during the Every Sperm is Sacred sequence, as I do again and again."
2,Not funny...I know I'm supposed too like it but it's the worst,This is the worst movie put out by Monty Python. Not really all that funny at all. If you want some Monty Python choice one of their other films.
5,Cliff Notes brought to life...with a easy-to-digest method!!,"This is one tape you seriously need if your gonna take up Philosophy in College or High School.What it took God a certain number of days, takes the Monty Python gang a insane hour or so to dismantle.Seriously, they take the meaning of life and litteraly skew it to such lengths that would even get Philosophy teachers thinking...and laughing.From the Maternity ward, to the African continent, to even Heaven, no place is safe from these folk.If you want to know the meaning of life, this is as best you can go without going insane with a detailed textbook, or reading Socrates.P.S. The skit in the begining is a hoot of the Business culture today!!"
3,"At times, incredibly funny... but other parts less so!","I've always loved the works of Monty Python, and this movie included some hilarious stuff. But they've also always had their not-particularly-amusing material, and this film had a LOT of it, as well! Worth seeing, but hardly a classic Monty Python film."
4,"""The Meaning of Liff""...uh, I meant ""Life""!","Being the last Monty Python film, ""The Meaning of Life"" is certainly not the best one overall, but still has some unbeliveably funny moments worth seeing. Such highlights include a sex-ed course unlike anything ever seen, a pirate movie full of accountants, an explanation into the sacredness of well, life, a man with an insatiable appetite for food (and vomiting), and of course, a visit from Death at a dinner party (something to do with the reaping...). This 2-disc set has many extras, including interviews with the above-ground Pythons, deleted scenes, and an intimate look at restoring the film (albeit in some reader reviews, that's the least of the problems with this release) and remastering it to its original semi-glory (by any means cheaply). All in all, a great package for a good film (expect for that minor image quibble...)."
5,"a fish, a fish, a fishy fish.","A must have for Python fans. Is there really anything else I need to say?a fish, a fish, a fishy fish."
1,"Yup, the dvd picture is f-ed up....","Something went wrong with the print on these dvds, apparently, because everytime someone or something moves, they distort. I've discovered that the Zoom x2 function alleviates this, but if you're watching widescreen it chops it down to approximately fullscreen ratio. So I'm waiting for there to be a recall or something, because I know that if I return this I'll just get another bad copy. It's probably present in the first 100,000 or however many they make in the first batch."
2,"Their last..And sadly, not their best.","The opinions on the production of this movie have varied between the Python team. John Cleese felt that the movie was a nightmare to make, whereas Terry Jones thought it was the best thing they have ever made to date. I have to agree with John Cleese on this. I thought this was probably the worst movie they have made as a team. It is also sadly their last. It spends too much time being vulgar and resorting to sexual humour and lacks the usual Python wit of their previous films. Although, there have been sexual innuendo's in their past movies, it is over done in this one. There are a few good scenes in the movie, I thought the WWI scene with the soldiers paying respect to their commanding officer by giving him various elaborate gifts while their being killed one at a time was very funny, as was the Liver Doner and Find the Fish. But the jokes are so far and in between the movie does not work as a whole and I left feeling very unsatisfied afterwards."
2,"It's not bad, it just isn't particularly funny","After being convulsed in hysterics while viewing The Holy Grail and The Life of Brian, I had great expectations for this film. Unfortunately, it rather let me down. While the production values and musical numbers are well-done, only about one fiftieth of the film even made me chuckle; the whole thing was just blah. The only scene that really made me laugh was when John Cleese was teaching a sexual education class and gave his students a very realistic lesson... other viewers know what I mean.I didn't hate it, but this is definitely their worst effort and a very bad starting point if you're looking to get into Monty Python."
2,Not their best...,"I love (and own) every single Monty Python episode, and love every one of their movies except...this one. The surreal opening number by Terry Gilliam is absolutely brilliant, and the first couple of skits are funny, and then it just gets lame, dull, and generally unfunny. They may have had in mind that they were going to push the boundaries of comedy with this movie, but the results are reminiscent of their occasional dud TV episodes, where the viewer sits waiting in vain for something actually funny to happen. If you've never seen Monty Python, DON'T START HERE!! Get Life of Brian or The Holy Grail to see their real brilliance."
3,"not bad, but...","this one was all right, but overall it was the least of the three python films. recently i read an article by the python troup, and they confirmed what i thought when i saw this movie; contractual obligation. they did this movie because they were under contract and they were told that they'd never have to do another movie again. ah well, such is life. it has many fine moments, such as the live organ transplant, etc."
2,not for me,The two stars I rated this DVD was for only one reason. I ordered this movie think it was going to be in a regular case. I ended up getting this really cool 100th Anniversary case.The reason I order this movie was because I thought it was going to be funny. I thought I saw it before back in my young years. But I guess it was just commercials that I saw and enjoyed. This movie sucks. I didn't enjoy one scene!!!! I usually don't regret buying a movie that ended up sucking. Because I was able to add it to my DVD collection. This is the only movie so far that I regret buying.
3,"Strange, to say the least","This movie is so completely weird. It explains everything you ever wanted to know about life, well, not really, but that is the name of the movie isnt it? It covers the wonders of reproduction, catholic beliefs, corporate pirates flying a building taking over, and of course, the in-escapable subject--sex. I thought some areas rather funny, but some must have been made while someone was on a bit too much LSD. I dont know if i would recommend it, but if you really want to see it, go to the movie store and rent it every time the need arises."
2,The worst Monty Python film,"After classics like ""Life of Brian"" and ""The Holy Grail"" this is just disappointing. The famous humour has become stale. The Pythons try to be funny by showing exaggerated violence (live organ transplant) and simply disgusting sketches (the fat man in the restaurant). All of these elements have been done before in Flying Circus, but there they were much better. This movie does have some good sketches, though. I really like the ""Every sperm is sacred"" song. I'd rather recommend watching ""Monty Python live at the Hollywood Bowl"". That is much better than ""The Meaning of Life""."
4,FULLY WONDERFUL WITHOUT MEANING,"This is a wonderful film! With the music, the jokes and the wonderful actors this film is probably one of the best works of the Pythons. From everything to MAKING Fun of religion to a celebration on the battle field, Monty Python is crude, funny and worth it.Rated R (Frontal women nudity, language, sexual themes, crude jokes)"
1,You must be joking!,"Eighty-five bucks! For a jumped-up CD? How about I offer you four? Come on, haggle! You've got to haggle it's traditional innit? Still, I only want to buy the DVD, not the rights to the movie! Has the WORLD GONE MAD? FIFTY QUID to watch Mr. Creosote throw up again? To listen to that song about SPERM again? Some people may be completely bonkers about this stuff, but not for this much dosh? Oh no. What's so special about a 5"" disk of plastique which makes it worth more than eight times a long thin piece of plastic tape (which I note can be had for under ten bucks). Huh? Think I'm stupid?::::::All right, you're on. Er, you can keep my name out of it can't you?"
5,completely hysterical,"This is probably the most ridiculous but most hilarious movie I have ever seen in my life. Yeah...that's pretty much all I have to say about it. Oh yes: DO NOT show this movie to ANYONE under the age of 13 or 14 or to someone who vomits easily by visual acts. I agree with the person who said: ""If you can stomach the Mr. Creosote scene, you can stomach ANYTHING."" I have never seen anything more nauseating than that scene. I'm usually ok about watching really gorey and disgusting stuff, but that scene really made me feel sick to my stomach."
2,Monty Python's 3rd best film badly needs restoration,"This film is a series of shorts that are big budget as far as Monty Python standards go. The first sketch about a group of old accountants staging an office mutiny and turning their building into a pirate ship pretty much falls flat, but the remaining sketches are hilarious.Unfortunately, the quality of the print this was remastered from is in horrible shape. There are scratches and dirt throughout the film. Hopefully, they'll do a restoration on this sometime soon."
3,Eric Idle and John Cleese present,"To me, this is not a Monty Python movie. The humour might be intact, but its not really a Python movie. I've watched the series and seen The Quest for the Holy Grail, this is not Python. Where was Graham Chapman? I dont know the history behind the troupe, but where the hell is Chapman? He is usually in every sketch and he was absent for most of the movie. I saw Cleese and Idle alot, but not enough Chapman. The movie just seemed to be a attempt to make Python look cool by swearing and adding nudity. Didnt really work for me. All and all, the worst Python ive seen yet."
4,"Quite funny, but not the greatest (4 1/2 stars)","Monty Python remains the greatest source of irreverent intellectual humor this side of The Simpsons, and Monty Python's the Meaning of Life is no exception to the rule. The only problem is that the film isn't quite as funny as one might hope. It's good, but Monty Python and the Holy Grail remains an all-around funnier movie.Which is not to say this movie does not contain great bits. Things such as an animated bit with a leaf (my favorite Monty Python gag ever) and a song about Roman Catholics are some of the most hilarious stuff the Pythons have ever mounted. The rest of the movie is amusing, such as Mr. Cresote, but some bits fall a little bit flat.Still, this is a must-own. This DVD made my must-buy list immediately -- ..."
2,"Not funny, stupid!","This movie is 20% comedy, 40% gay, 10% funny, and 30% of a waste of your life. There is barley any comedy, or stuff thats even funny. The best part is watching a group of naked girls chase a stupid man for 10 seconds."
1,Let's hope this ISN'T the meaning of life!,"I made the mistake of watching this movie with some friends a couple years ago. It was absolutely disgusting. It was full of nudity, cussing, violence, crude jokes, and much more! It was just pointless. After watching the movie, you are left thinking, ""Why did I just watch this?"" If you want to be grossed out, try this film. Let's hope the real meaning of life is not reflected in this movie."
1,This disc should have been recalled,"If you purchased this disc, and it does not have ""V2"" on disc one, contact Universal for a replacmeent, even if it plays fine on your current DVD player.Here is why - the problem is with progressive scan DVD players and progressive scan monitors. Very few people have both, so the problem will not rear its ugly head until you upgrade.The movie is completely unwatchable in this configuration.Do yourself a favor, and get disc one replaced now, before it is too late."
5,Classic,"This is Monty Python at its best. The humor is terrific, and the entire story line is hilarious! After a classic like ""The Holy Grail"", but a failed excused for a comedy like ""Life of Brain"", (but the Suicide Squad was brillant), its great they made another classic film. I read they're planning on coming back in the newspaper. I sure hope so. Oh, and whomever gave this movie a bad review, SCREW YOU! Thank you."
5,Monty Python's The Meaning of Life dvd,"I'm sorry to say that I still haven't looked at this movie. Its on my deskand I'll get around to it eventually. I saw the movie years ago and that isthe reason I ordered this DVD......It's that funny to me, but its not like I'mdriven to see right away. Thanks olg"
3,"eh, it was alright but it was still python","Though it was their last movie is was not their best movie. The Crimson Permenent Insurence or whatever (I won't even give it the time to look up) was half [dumb] and boring. It had some funny aspects and by some I mean 2. The rest of the movie was dirty, dirty, dirty but it had it's good moments like the tiger scene, the death scene and find the fish still makes me laugh. Who am I kidding I just liked all of micheal palin's characters. Anyway I'm still going to buy it because there are parts I want to watch again and it's well...Monty Python but it's still not their best and I was a tad disappointed."
3,Hilariously Disgusting (and vice-versa),"I have to agree with many of the comments made previously, along with the film critics. There are some overlong scenes, particularly the Crimson Permanent Assurance which precedes the film's opening credits. But fans of Python will certainly not be disappointed. My personal favorite sequences: the birthing scene, John Cleese as a schoolmaster teaching sex education (with the rigor of quantum physics!), live organ transplants, and the middle years (with Terry Jones as the world's fattest man); the latter two are both a laugh riot as well as gross and revolting! The musical numbers are also wonderfully amusing. One sad fact is that this is last film made by the complete Python troupe and will remain so since Graham Chapman passed away."
4,Never gets stale...,"Every few years I see this film and I still love it! Unlike a lot of people I really enjoy the unforgettable images of the Crimson Permanent Assurance short (too many years lost in the business world, I guess). Some people who think Robin Williams is funny, and others think Monty Python is funny. I'm absolutely in the latter school. (Incidentally, don't see this movie to learn about the meaning of life...!)"
4,Not quite so good as the others,"I'd still reccomend these geniouses for any Christmas stocking, birthday gift or Easter Basket. Hey look, I'm my own marketing campaign!"
5,British humor at its best!!!,"Before I start my review, I want to say that I haven't seen any of the other Python movies, so I am not comparing it to the others. After a friend kept saying that I had to see this movie, I finally rented it and laughed until I was sick. Other than the overlong short at the begining, this film was great. The best skits were the ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" song, Learning and Growing, Live Organ Transplants, and the fat man sketch. I know it was gross, but I think it was the best of the bunch. Sick humor has never been funnier!!!"
1,Avoid this DVD! Disk one replaced.....still defective!,I have just received the replacement disk #1 for this title. My replacement disk is as defective as the original. The visual distortion appears on both of my DVD players. You should wait until this problem is resolved before wasting your money.This is a really good movie and it is a shame that it was released in this way.
2,Disappointing,I thought this film wasn't as good as Holy Grail or Life of Brian. I think it was too sexual with too much swearing. The show was funny and so was Holy Grail without that content. It detracts from the experience.
1,Not up to par,"I have seen both The Holy Grail, and The Life of Brian and this one did not meet my expectations after seeing those. I laughed thrice, maybe. I almost skipped the entire second section, as younger persons were present and we were utterly disgusted with it. If you have a taste for sexual humor, you'll most definitely enjoy this film more than I. The second disk is not even worth slipping into your player, and if, like me, you have a compatibilty issue with Disk 1 and you live in another country, it's going to be a hassle to get a replacement.The fish were comical, and the entire segment on fighting was brilliant, but that was all of the humor I seemed to find up until a few minutes near the end. If you've never watched Monty Python, I suggest you start with one of the other movies, as this one could turn you off of a truly great source of hilarity."
4,This is the finest work of satire in film history.,"If it were not for pioneers like Monty Python, then performers like Brian Gilmore and Esteban Rodriguez would never have been inspired to do their brilliant satirical work. This film is a must see event for anyone who knows how to think."
5,"The smartest film ever, can't ever be topped.",This film is a film for smart people to laugh at the plot while stupid people laugh at the jokes. A five star must see. END
1,Dear Universal: Please let me know when you fix this disc,"First, THANK GOD for online reviews! I was all set to buy this film for the second time on DVD (I have the earlier Image edition) but will now wait until the Disk 1 problem is corrected. You'd think somebody at Universal would have popped this into a DVD player before pressing a gazillion fawlty copies. Well, you'd THINK that, anyway.The good news for owners of the old, out-of-print Image edition is that they apparently have a superior DVD version of the film. Not only that, but its value, which plummeted upon the announcement of this new edition, is certain to rise again (until Universal gets its act together).As for the film, I'd give it 4 stars. Certainly not as good as Holy Grail and Life of Brian, but LIGHT YEARS ahead of what tries to pass itself off as comedy these days.I'm sure it'll make a great Christmas present to myself ... that is, if a corrected pressing is issued."
1,Warning! Poor transfer!,"Just a word of advice... a lot of people are reporting problems with Universal's new Monty Python's Meaning of Life DVD. Disc Two of the set is fine, but the movie disc is plagued by strange picture artifacts - blurring of movement, etc. It could very well be an encoding problem with the disc itself."
1,"LOVE THE MOVIE, BUT THE VIDEO IS JACKED UP!!!","I bought the movie wends. and the video is blurry. My friends also bought the movie, and its blurry on these ALSO!!!"
5,Proof that there is no god ...,"... or else the entire production crew would have been struck down immediately after the premiere! The Meaning of Life is brilliant - it's funny, irreverant, delightful. The music is perfect. Just stay away from the salmon pate."
5,I bought this because they told me too. On the Monty Python Free YouTube Channel!,"And now I know ""The Meaning of Life!"" We are all programmed to carry out orders! lol Freida"
5,The meaning of life: Only from Monty Python,"I think, this is the best of the films by the British comedy troupe Monty Python. The quality is superb, and the DVD is filled with extras that are outstanding and comical. The interviews are memorable with the Monty Python cast and crew. The commentary by Jones and Gilliam is very astute.If you are a fan of Monty Python like me, you owe it to yourself to get this HD DVD. Definitely a must have!"
2,Ideal for quick learner...,"I usually do not have trouble following choreography but this workout has poor instruction, boring music, and just way too fast. I have been working out to belly dance, tahitian, hula,latin, yoga, and pilates for several years now so I thought I would try hip hop. I guess I just picked out the wrong DVD to introduce myself into this type of workout. The instructor just moves and expect you to follow and get it then just dance away....If you are an intermediate/advanced hip hop dancer then this one is for you."
4,These stories never age. They metamorphosize.,"A collection of stories that we grew up hearing, but with all new skin. These re-tellings give new blood to Ovid and infuse his timeless book with modern spirit. Give: Apollo and Daphne packs a punch with its Elivs-like god and neo-feminist victim. A bevy of talented writers prove that familiar plots do not have to retain their old luster but can be polished anew. After Ovid is a wonderful way to loose yourself in imagination as you see the familiar become at once perverse and natal and finally familiar again."
3,solid bokken,I bought this for my son. The bokken is well balanced and the wood is very nice. He does not use it since the handle is shorter than the one he had and he is nearly ready to move up to the next size. With a full size handle this would have been a great training bokken but for now it hangs on the wall.
5,wonderful,"I stumbled across this in a used book store and picked it up on a whim having no idea what it was about. Glad I did; it opened up a whole new world! The writing style is just sublime after reading styles from modern authors for years. To find out about a whole style of life, a different way of thinking, a whole different way of being.... amazing. And the life of the man himself, yes I agree with the title. What work must have gone into this to find obscure and old writings on this person is beyond me.I am thankful to have read such a fine work and feel enriched for it."
3,Pope John Paul? Fooled me,"This Cd is only ok, it does not stand out as much as some other cd releases, while i say this, it is a must for all you Catholics out there, to be catholic and not to buy one of these cd's is an insult on John Paul II. The first time i heard this cd i didn't know it was from the Pope, i liked it, but it just wasn't all there in a way, it lacked stanima.. but it was an ok listen. I'd recomend it to only Catholics and other people out there who like a mellow cd"
5,Music of the Lord TRANSFORMs into Divine LOVE to mankind,"All of us needs to have the ""ABBA PATER"" CD and be healed with His musical message. The beauty of the music moves me spritually whenever I listen in my car.What a gift from Heaven!Listen, meditate, and understand the Words of His Holiness. The world needs to listen during the preparation of Jubilee of year 2000.Come Holy Spirit, Come! Fill the heart of the Faithful. Father, Have Mercy on all of us. Amen."
5,GREAT! Just what the world needs!,"Pope John Paul II has struck a chord for all persons in this world through this unique and tastefull cd of music, prayer, and meditation. I am going to tell ALL my friends about it. The Holy Father proves to be ""in touch"" with reality and esp. the youth and all cultures. Don't miss this one for your music collection. God bless the Holy Father! Thank you!"
5,Beautiful!,"I've been listening to this CD since I was 9. I found it so inspiring. Also, I learned some Latin and Italian from the prayers. I only consider myself an spiritual person, but his words can be so moving regardless of your beliefs."
3,Great CD but could've been better.,"Chantings and Music of this CD with Pope John Paul II's own voice is amazing. However, they could've made it better by making the Pope chant some more. Overall, it's an average album and buyer will not be too disappointed."
3,Handle not as good as the 5 qt bowl; broke off,"I bought this as a spare bowl and have had it for about 2 years. Recently while removing it from the mixer with cake batter in it, the top of the handle suddenly broke off from the body. Luckily I didn't end up with cake batter all over my feet but it was a close call! I called KA Customer service to see if the warranty covers this, but was told that the warranty on the bowls is only 1 year (as it is on the mixers) so I'm out of luck. There's no way to reattach the top of the handle, so I'll be replacing this bowl with the 5 qt model which has a more substantial, more comfortable, and hopefully better-attached handle. But I wouldn't buy this one again."
5,Extra bowl,"I just received the extra bowl and it will come in handy when I make cookies, pies, and meat balls, etc. I like having a handle to hold on to. It sure is nice and shiny. I would recommend purchasing the extra bowl to others."
5,A much needed addition,We purchased the work bowl with the handle for our daughter as a Christmas gift. She is delighted with the work bowl with a handle and we were delighted with the service provided by Amazon.com. As always the order arrived in a very timely manner even though we didn't choose any of the optional shipping methods and the item was packaged well and arrived in perfect condition. We would recommend this work bowl to anyone who has a Kitchen Aid stand mixer and the work bowl without a handle.
5,Love the Handle!,"I bought this to replace the bowl that came with my KitchenAid Stand Mixer. The bowl it came with did not have a handle on the side and that made for messy work when pouring the bowl or trying to grasp it to scrape dough from the inside. I love having the mixing bowl with the handle. I highly reccommend it! As a bonus, I now have two bowls for the mixer and that has proved immensely useful."
5,Good solid bowl for the right mixer,"I bought this, mistakenly thinking it was for the mixer that my wife owns, and it is the wrong brand. I can't think of the brand at the moment, so let this serve as a warning. You should probably only buy this if you own a KitchenAid mixer. It probably won't fit other brands.That said, however, this is real quality. We kept it for that reason. The whole bowl is solidly made. The handle is solidly attached. I frankly cannot imagine this thing falling apart except through severe abuse. Its hard to even imagine it getting dented much in normal usage.So, if you have the the right manufacturer, this bowl will be ideal for you: really good solid quality."
5,Great price and works perfectly with my Artisan Mixer!,"This is a very nice bowl. It works perfectly with my Artisan mixer. Very fast shipping with Amazon Prime and it was well packaged, not damaged at all. Great bowl for the money :-)"
3,quantity purchasing,"I am happy with the product. I wanted to order three of these, and the web site did not allow me to do that with a single purchase. I had to pay individual shipping on each purchase. Pleas e address this problem and fix so more than one of an item can be ordered. Thanks"
2,"Nice Bowl, Terrible Price","I mean, come on...40 bucks for a stainless steel bowl?I would like to have another, but not at that price."
2,At least free shipping,If you had give 40.00 for a bowl at least it could be free shipping for the holidays.
5,You've got to get an extra bowl!!,"This bowl is fantastic. I'm not quite sure how I got by with just one kitchenaid mixing bowl before I got this one. There are so many times that you're making one recipe and don't want to stop to wash a bowl (or if it needs to soak first, or it's still full of batter, i.e., if you made cookies and just have the first batch in the oven, and want to make another dish with the mixer). Also the handle on this one makes it easier to unscrew the bowls off the base if you put them on too tightly to start with! Plus my original bowl easily stacks inside this one, so it's no problem for storage - it literally takes up NO extra space on the counter-top or in the cupboards!"
5,Lightening fast delivery!,"I ordered this on Monday, it arrived today - Wednesday. Amazingly fast! It took a few minutes to swap out with my stock seat and is very cushy, comfortable, and supporting. Haven't taken a long ride yet to see the difference, but I am looking forward to a better riding experience based on other feedback."
3,Good reference book,"The book is informative, and has good pictures. I like it, but it's still missing a lot- caring for these old houses is a lot more complicated than they make it sound"
2,Disappointing,I didn't find the book to be helpful or even enjoyable. Little to no information about transitioning an older Bungalow as I had understood the book would contain.
2,Not enough bungalows?,Why are the same photos and/or houses sprinkled throughout the book? Maybe they need a proof-viewer?
3,restoration versus modernizing,The book did not meet my expectations. Photos are great but I was looking for restoration of 1920 house with authentic appliances and details. This book is focused on modernizing bugalow style home.
5,Wonderfull book,"I think this is one of the best medical textbooks. This book is only one you need in residency. Well written, easy to understand,good and practical illustrations"
5,Great Text easier to read than most text books,"A rare text book that can take a complex subject and explain it in a less complex way. It does not over simplify, but is more readable than the typical text book."
5,best basic emg book out there!,This is an excellent book for anyone starting out learning NCS/EMGs. It describes setups and tests in detail and provides rationale for the science behind the tests so that the learner truly understands why things are being done the way that they are. Great value.
2,Poor,Most of the twinkies were smashed a bit. Could of been packed a little safer/better. Still delicious though. Nice to have a box for yourself :)
1,too high price for hostess twinkies,this item sells for about $4.95 in most supermarkets when its not on sale.but it almost always is and then sells for $2.50- $3.00.The price of $7.99 offered here is just way too high.
2,The white woman has an opinion,"Listen up, I'm a big-boned gal who has yo-yoed in weight over the years. Thankfully I'm currently on a downswing, and I hope it stays that way. Which brings me to Hostess Twinkies which are very overrated. This is one of my least favorite Hostess snacks, if you want the truth. The sponge cake is stinky."
1,Not in our house!,"Come on, this is 2005. Twinkies aren't ""food"" anymore than Cheez Whiz is. Twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies. Consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines. Everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while - I'm just as guilty of that - but eating Twinkies is practically self-mutilation. Look at the ingredients list and do some reading. Yikes! Everyone's family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too. Sorry Hostess, that definitely does not include Twinkies."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"Absolutely awful!! Total ripoff. First of all the box was completely ripped open. Inside there are only 8 ""Twinkies"" not the 10 that it says on the box. I use quotes because they're not even real twinkies...just an off brand put into a twinkies box which by the way expired in December...don't even want to know how old the box is because we all know REAL twinkies live forever. Bought these as part of my husband's Valentine's day gift. VERY disappointed I spent $25 for an expired box of 8 knock off ""twinkies"" that I could have bought in the store for $4...NOT HAPPY!!!!"
5,Blood In Our Boots,"I am writing this review to let other browsers know that the wrong Table of Contents is shown on this web site for the book Blood In Our Boots. This book is the story of Ed Haider who trained as a ParaTrooper in WWII and participated in the first jump into Sicily and ended up in the Stalag 2B. You will enjoy his story. I have listened to Ed tell these stories for the past few years,and his book has the same great ""storytelling"" qualities."
3,Amateur Writing,This veteran has an amazing story to tell. Its too bad there wasn't a good editor or ghost writer to help him tell it. Far too many redundancies and too few examples of what he experienced.
1,wizard of oz stencil book,paid 2.99 plus shipping for a tiny (3x5) stencil book with a pre-printed price of $1.00. I ended up paying $6.98 for a $1.00 book.
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stay Away,"Product arrived broken, NO BIGGIE, called to get replacement....Over a month later and I still have nothing. I email this lamp co again, this time to request a call tag and refund but I can't seem to get anyone to reply to my emails or call back! Save yourself a headache and stay AWAY. I love amazon but this store, NOT!"
1,Invest in something else,"First I must confess that I have wanted a stand mixer for years. As I was researching grain mills I found this, and used it as my excuse to buy the mixer. I love the mixer, but the mill is terrible. I wanted to use this mainly to grind gluten free flours, however rice comes out much too grainy to be of any use in baking. Even after several runs through the mill it has the consistency of large grains of sand. I tried to contact Kitchen Aid via e mail to see if there is any kind of internal adjustment that can be made, but they never got back to me."
1,Don't Bother,"I got this mill about two years go and I loved it the first couple of times I used it. However, it killed my KA mixer. I have to agree with a previous review that talked about the amount of strain on the machine. My husband just took ours apart to see why it wouldn't work and the gears are shot. I would not recommend grinding wheat with your KA. If you plan to grind, buy a real grinder and keep the KA just for mixing."
3,Grain mill.,"I like this machine, for the price. It grinds grain well, with one exception, this unit does not grind oats."
3,waste of money,"I bought this for grinding organic whole wheat; and granted it is the hard variety of wheat, however this grinder just doesn't work. It won't grind the wheat fine enough to make into an kind of bread. I have tried passing the grain through multiple times, with little improvement. I have also tried grinding corn, and faced a similar problem. The simple fact is that this grinder looks good, but doesn't put out. Save yourself a hassle and spend more money for something that works. In the end it will be cheaper than finding out the hard way, like I did.Update: If you take off the front (the adjusting nob) you can calibrate the machine to the correct fineness. The instruction manual said nothing about this, but now that I have fixed the machine, it actually grinds the ""fine"" setting well. so now Im upgrading this product to 3 stars instead of just 2."
3,KitchenAid Grain Mill,I ordered the Grain Mill in the picture (the older style) because that was what I wanted but instead was sent the new model. I am not happy but because it was a gift I had no time to send it back and re-order from someone else. I should have been contacted and told that they were going to make a substitution.
3,Fine for one loaf,"If you want to take the time to grind twice just for one loaf that's okay,BUT, if you are interested in grinding 5 or more pounds at once this is not the mill you want. Try the Grainmaster with the lifetime warranty."
3,Good Except For the Company That Ships It,"I purchased this off the Amazon website, but it was sold and shipped through [...]. The product I got was not new as stated, but used. It had a dent on the side and when I took it apart, the grinding wheels inside were worn down."
2,This book needs a good editor,"I bought this book because I needed to know the material for my work. The material and its extent are good, the only problem I am having is one that is common today. It was written by people who do not have English as their first language. What would make the book alot easier to read and less confusing is the employment of a good English speaking editor to polish the presentation of the ideas. The subject is not so simple that one can forgive arbitrariness in usage of words or phrases to explain the ideas. It is frustrating because I really need to know this material, for my job, and I do not need the extra load of trying to guess what the authors meant to say. The book is important and deserves a good editing job."
5,Thorough and discerning,"A thorough and discerning book. Nicoletta's matter-of-fact prose is a welcome antidote to the nostalgia and sentiment that creep into more reverential treatments of the Shakers. Like any other history, Shaker history turns out to be complex and messy, not simple and sweet. How interesting to see Shaker buildings of the Victorian era, with floral wallpapers, clunky furniture, and primitive telephones."
2,"Not bad, not great","This book delves inconsistently into shaker architecture, but the style is very pedantic and unfocused. By the way, Kucher, who wrote the first glowing review is Nicolleta's husband. So take that review with a grain of salt."
2,i wont buy it.,"i like and use the ""look inside"" feature all the time. if a publisher cant give me more than one page or two to get a feeling of what is on the inside,,then they dont want to sell them all that badly.i guess they use the ""look inside"" thing as a ploy that they dont take seriously,to bad for the writer, because i do.and another thing,i wish i knew if what the other guy said about the first reviewer being the writers husband was true.. if it is true,and what he wrote,a glowing review,, being biased and saying anything to sell a book dont cut it with me.i cant stand dishonesty.if its true,,, i dont care how good it is,i wouldnt buy it. i hate being thought of as a sucker.that said,i think i have bought nearly every other book on the shakers that is sold on this site."
2,Too short,"I have been searching for quality live performance dvd's for a while and so I went for this one after purchasing Alice in Chains Unplugged, which is fantastic! But this dvd is super short for the price. If you want to be able to turn on the dvd player and listen for a long period of time, this is not your dvd. I should have spent some more time looking for other versions. It is quality music, just had to live up to a great performance which was not delivered. My suggestion, choose another Unplugged performance or compilation."
5,Slammin',i have to say that this DVD is the ultimate music dvd it contains a really cool stuff (full of surprises) belive me if you see this DVD ... you will feel that it`s the first dvd in your life ...belive me you`ll not be sorry
5,Awesome Movie,"I am lucky enough to have this movie on VHS. Before Robert Downey Jr. just completely fell into a world of somewhere that seems to be the land of no return he was quick witted, funny, sexy and charismatic and his hosting the camera's adventure during the politcal conventions of '92 was actually brilliant! Everyone should see this movie. It rules!"
5,Last Party rocks,"This is a smart, witty and very even-handed look at the turbulent world of politics in an election year, and from a brilliant young actor who is just wading into his responsibilities as a voter. You get to wander around both Democratc and Republican conventions as well as the floor of the stock exchange, and talk with people at street level who are dealing with the realities of economic strife. You also meet his new wife and his also-brilliant dad and step-mother. It takes place during the 1992 Clinton-Bush race and is well worth your time, whether you're a movie buff, a Downey fan, or a politico."
3,Very Strange indeed,"A little, ahem, Different. The Doctor arrives on the planet Vortis to find that he can't get off it. What's more, there are giant ant's called Zarbi's running around. The story isn't that great but has some good moments. The repetitive BLEEP which the Zarbis make is quite annoying but you get use to it. Not the greatest Doctor Who story ever!"
2,ok story from the hartnell era,"in this adventure, the doctor and his companions are stuck on the planet vortis. They discover that the planet is under siege from a alien menace. The story is ok but is a bit overlong, it could of easily been 4 episodes instead of the six it is. The insects are ok if you like the dancing!!Another annoying thing is hear the planets people saying ""Zarbi!"" over and over again. The doctor and his companios along with the help of the planets people defeat the alien menace. The only postive thing about this video is the cliffhanger from the ""the rescue/romans"" is finally finshed!!!buy only if you all the doctors and can handle the various plot threads, giant bugs dancing and a very slow story!!!it is ok for an once in a while viewing!!"
1,Not good.,"Although apparently a classic, I find it hard to like this video. Although the plot is original, and the script is full of interesting ideas, the realisation on screen is terrible. The action plods along at such a slow rate that it becomes almost unbearable. There are many scenes of ""aliens"" simply walking around and saying nothing, and these are also dreadfully slow. William Hartnell is pretty good as the Doctor, and Jacqueline Hill and William Russel are alright as Ian and Barbara, but Maureen O'Brien is just terrible as Vicki. There is an endless line of mistakes in the story (try visiting the DOCTOR WHO BLOOPERS site, and you'll see what I mean), and so on the whole, this is only a partial success, and in plot only."
4,Quintessential Hartnell Who,"I may be one of the few reviewers who actually remembers seeing the original broadcast of the Web Planet in 1965 (shown later in North America than in the UK). Seeing it again after all these years faithfully recreated the original brooding creepiness of the early Dr Who. It's slow, yes; dated, yes; creaky, yes. But it still has the power to transport you to another world if you're willing....Of course the best Hartnell Who of the bunch was the Marco Polo series, which has sadly been lost."
2,"Sorry, but this was awful","Although the plot of the story is very good, this adventure really shouldn't have been done. It looks like a bad school play, and half the time it seems that the actors, and the director, were asleep. If you do buy it, be warned, don't watch anything like Star Wars before, otherwise you won't be able to stop laughing."
1,A bit slow,"I am a fan of William Hartnell's portrayel of the first doctor, however this is one story of his that I own for collection purposes only. It is slow moving and hard to look at. The creatures in this one could have been better and the story better written."
1,The worst Doctor Who episode ever made.,"Although I love Doctor Who, I have to admit that this was the worst Doctor Who episode I have seen. The quality of the footage is excellent, however the original plot and filming is terrible. For instance, in one part you can see the shadow of Ian Chesterton fall across the ""distant"" mountain range. The plot is very slow moving, involving people in bug costumes standing around waving their hands. There are some good Doctor #1 episodes out there. This isn't one of them."
2,Mini it isn't,"I don't know how they could advertise this as a mini mouse. It's maybe 1/4 inch shorter than my regular size mouses/mice(?) and the same width. I bought it for my Asus eee computer, so the ""mini"" mouse was way too big for my mini laptop. I was hoping for something the size of my Targus mini mouse, which broke. It's about 2-1/2 times the size!I can't tell you how it works, as I returned it immediately."
3,"Fun, but Can be Boring!","This was my first military game and overall it has great graphics and it is fun to play. However, the game can get boring after awhile."
2,GRJS,"terrible graphics ,PC version is much better, Socom is a better game .Not at all what I was expecting the game play is slugish and team members sometimes ignore you."
4,Not As Hot As The Game Cover Looks,"First Of All, Let Me Start Off Saying You Won't Play This Game Enough To Get Addicted To It.This Game Isn't The True Sequel To Ghost Recon.Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm Isn't The Best Game In The Tom Clancy Franchise, The Graphics Are Crappy, The Gameplay Is Hott But Still Won't Win You Over It'll Just Be A Waste Of You Money.And When You Get Shot, The Screen Gets Blurry And That's A Waste. You Only Have 3 Team Members With Only 2 Teams, And The Game Is Just Wack And So Is It's Storyline, (Rent If You Urgently Wanna Play It But It's Just Not Type Hott). Trust Me.If You're Lookin For A Tactical Shooter Buy Rainbow Six 3 or If You're Just Lookin For A Tom Clancy Game, Buy Splinter Cell And Splinter Cell:Pandora Tomorrow, It's Worth Your Bucks."
4,Good Shooter Game,"It would seem that several people dont appear to like this new game. I would have to DISAGREE!!As a late 20's player I give it 4 stars. You have two single player campains and each level you complete ""unlocks"" that map for thee multiplayer. Which leads me to my next comment about this game. With all the maps ""unlocked"" the multiplayer is very enjoyable!! In conclusion this Ghost Recon is absolutely better than the first one and if you like shooters this is definately a good one to pick up for the PS2."
2,NOTHING WAS IMPROVED!,Man where do i start... lets start with how choppy the graphics are you would think they would of improved new skins or new guns or a new engine its the same crap but just worse. and why the hell did they take out the blood ya thats right thiers no BLOOD! you can shoot the guys on the ground dead right in thier face and it has no effect. the only good thing about this game is ummm...the online play thats just about it but the servers can be a pain sometime. so if you have been playing the xbox version stick with that cause you will be dissapointed like i was...but if you havnt played the xbox version i would defenetly reccomend this cause you wont see how bad the ps2 version is from the xbox.
2,Ehh.. Not so great..,"I never myself liked any Tom Clancy games just because of their controls and style.. i am very picky when it comes to the games I like, and I must say this game was not to my liking.First off, the single player is horrible, so simply don't bother with that.Next off, the online mode is not very well done either, simply because there is not enough people online and the levels are too hugeNext, the graphics are horrible. I know graphics aren't everything, but these graphics are absolutely horrible.Finally, the one and only good thing; the multi player. I found the split screen mode enjoyable to play with a friend because you actually have to make up strategies for this game; you can't run and gun in this game without a strategy.All in all, this game is only good if you have a buddy next to you playing it with you."
5,A great detective story,"This book was very interesting: unintended consequences from everyday activities.Hopefully, the peoples of the world can do better with other native flora."
4,"well written, but with errors?","I bought this book because I moved to Guam and a search for books about Guam didn't bring up much. It was a well written and interesting book, but I wonder if everything in it is true. I know, for instance, that the monitor lizards they claim are a dull brown are actually a brilliant rainbow of colors that show as mostly light green. The Tangantangan that covers the island is not a vine, its a shrub and here in Guam, away from its natural habitat, it grows to small tree size."
4,The functions of aesthetic death in the Third Reich.,"Jay Baird reviews the nazi martyrs, such as Horst Wessel and Herbert Norkus, and uses them to explain how the concept of immolation and self sacrifice was so central to the Hitler era. Poets such as Gerhard Schumann are also treated, though there is little on art, sculpture and architecture. Nazi heroes themselves owed much to Germany's mythical past (the Teutonic forests and all) which was especially loved by Himmler who saw himself as a reincarnation of the medieval ruler Henry The Fowler. There is an insightful concluding chaper on the myth of death in the second world war. As the Reich crashed into ruins, Goebbels was still proudly glorifying self sacrifice in his movie epic Kolberg. In this way, nazism sought to equate noble death as the moral equivalent of victory. However, to what extent all this propaganda really influenced the man in the street would make another and equally interesting book."
1,waste of money,"Do not buy it..was totally disappointed. Throws light all around..your camera is facing forward, why do you need light being thrown backwards also....it is a good diffuser IF you have white walls around you and ceiling that is close by. Look close at the instructional video, Gary's images are way underexposed. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Maybe for the completist,"The strings take away from the starkness of the originals and add a layer of hokiness. What's up with the overly busy slapback guitar on ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""? The schmaltzy backup singers? The unnecessary string flourishes? Not horrible, but I'd avoid unless you're a completist wanting to hear these classics in a new light."
2,Give Me A Break!,"We're on shaky ground here! The author doesn't write enough about SAFETY! No translucent soap recipes, encourages cheating by buying pre-made bars and melting it down,etc.Troubleshooting index was okay.Did learn things from this book that I didn't from other soap books.Appendix K was very insightful. The vegteable based soap chapter was nice, but it's too expensive to be buying palm oil and the like! Basicly the book is boring. Author wasn't very creative on the whole preperation of the book. I recommend The Complete Soapmaker by Norma Coney instead."
2,Hindsight is 20/20,"This book is an interesting look at the future of intelligence as seen from a perspective still influenced by an existing Soviet Union. The author's predictions are just plain incorrect, never taking into account the possibility of a downfall of the USSR. There are rather few useful reccomendations in this book, but it gives an idea about the views and thinking of U.S. intelligence during the Cold War."
2,not that good,I agree with the others... better check some chessex dice sets. I personally suggest speckled fire or nebula flame.J.
2,"THey are nice, kind of.",If you like pretty colors then you might like these. But your better off to buy normal 10-sided dice.
1,"Cheap, watery music","I was really disappointed by this CD. I've bought many karaoke musical CDs, and knew not to expect professional sounding tracks, but this disc failed to meet even those low expectations. The music was clearly done on a cheap synthesizer -- no hint of real instruments. The sound was muted, almost mushy, but with occasional, inexplicable jumps in volume and clarity. The only song I'd consider anywhere near decent was the Anthem. For the rest, well, you can do almost as well with a midi piano accompaniment."
5,An essential tool for any kitchen.,"I have had one Kitchen Aid mixer or another for years now. I remember my mom's old stand mixer, and can't imagine how I got along before the arrival of the K5. If you bake, you simply must have this mixer. Now, there are other good high-end mixers out there, but for reliability, power, and simple old-fashioned good looks, nothing beats the KA. Before any other kitchen countertop appliance, I would get a stand mixer. And, this is the stand mixer to get.Important Note: This model is the one where you lift the bowl, using a crank on the side. It is not the flip-top model (see the K90 for that). This is superior for heavy duty jobs, but does make it a bit harder to remove the attatchments without making a mess."
4,"Amusing views of flyfishing, worth a few chuckles","John Gierach is one of the better-known names in the flyfishing literature, and he continues his tradition of lively, entertaining anecdotes in this volume. Although his often-biting tone can get somewhat tiresome, the book nevertheless has some very amusing stories - a couple of them downright hilarious. Although everybody will find aspects of the book worthwhile, anglers (especially flyfisherfolk) will see aspects of themselves reflected here, and laugh heartily"
4,I Want to Go Fishing,After reading this book I want to go fishing.The author does a good job of describing the special joys of this passtime. His writing paints a beautiful picture that draws in even the uninitiated.Recommended for fishermen and non fishermen alike.
4,"Sex, Death and Flyfishing",Very entertaining. A great read for anyone interested in flyfishing or any other form of fishing.
2,Too Much Latin,I found this book to be less than exciting. The use of technical terms and Latin names of flies was not why I bought the book. I have liked Gierach's other books but was disappointed in this one.
4,Selling is Dead,"As with Spin Selling (Neil Rackham), it's pretty heavy reading, and contradicts a lot of old style selling techniques,so I am yet to see if it works well. But I do admit that selling has changed a lot over the years, and it could be worthwhile advice !"
2,"Book is fine but don't buy the ""Seven Treasures"" edition","This is an important book, a pleasure to read. But do NOT buy the Seven Treasures edition. Though it is a few dollars cheaper, it has no introduction, no index, no footnotes. There are many typographical errors - anything Dipthongs come out in weird characters, and there are several mispellings (and this beyond the non-standardized pronunciations; at various points the characters' names are misspelled).The entire edition looks as though it has been merely cut and pasted from one of the many free online texts onto MSWord, without much of a proofreading. You may as well do the same and avoid paying the 10 bucks + shipping."
2,Tedious read,"Although usually a fan of 18th Century literature, I found this book extremely tedious to read. The plot is thin, and situations repetitious. The foolish obsession of the heroine with romantic literature is overdone, and her suitor's devotion to her difficult to fathom as Arabella is vain, selfish, and unreasonable. Not a book I would recommend to anyone."
3,Poor product,"Though the description says this is waterbase lube, it is in fact a silicon-base lube. With a similar consistency to baby oil, the lube is a bit runny and can get messy (I'm used to using gel lubes), but it gets the job done. Kind of a pain to clean up after, and definitely not worth what I spent, but I'm not so dissatisfied that I won't use it.Overall, I'd suggest buying a different lube of a similar price."
4,Statlers American Legend,"Great compilation CD. 15 years or more of music, and not just the hits, but some of the quality album filler."
2,my bad,I think I was expecting hymns and that's not what I got so I was disappointed - but it was my mistake.
1,Chopped up.,"Nothing wrong with this if you want the short version (14 songs), but I recommend going with this same album from the 1996 or 1995 release. Many more songs and they had no business cutting them out. With this 2002 version you're just missing out."
3,"different but good, just too short",I knew this was a long shot just because the shoe was different from any I had had. I actually like the shoe. It is a lot like going barefoot. The only problem was that it was too short and I am a true 11N. It rubbed my toes a little sore. If I was ordering again I would get a 12n.
2,"Looks cool, Sounds awful!","Know how it works before you buy. Here's how it works:1) Turn on the scale using the kick switch along the right front edge.2) Listen to a loud beep as the scale turns on.3) Slide the scale back into place because it slid away from you when you turned it on with your foot.4) Wait several seconds for the scale to ""boot"" and set itself to zero.5) Listen to another loud beep indicating that it is ready to weigh you.6) Step on the scale and wait several seconds for another loud beep indicating that you may now read your weight.7) Step off the scale and head towards the shower to begin your morning routine.8) Hear another loud beep as the unit shuts down.9) Stop your morning routine to go and comfort the crying baby (or angry spouse) who was awakened by all that beeping.10) Return the item and write a review on Amazon.comBut it *looks* cool, doesn't it?"
3,It's okay,I used this scale for a couple of months and ended up throwing it away. I don't remember why I threw it away....sorry.
3,"nice feature, but....","I like the idea of having memory, temp readout and remote display (remove the display and mount it at eye level).The bad thing is it consumes batt. so fast. I replace batt. twice a year for the display and once less than a year for the main unit (need 2 different types of batt).I stop using it and buy a different one which I have not replaced batt for 2 years now. I use only the display to read temp, but still.. batt. runs out fast."
5,Expresso Made EZ,"This is one of the easiest ro use products I have ever seen. By utilizing a pre-packed cannisters and there is virtually no effort involved to make an excellent cup of expresso. Furthermore due to the pre-packaged system clean up is now a breeze. No dealing with grounds everywhere. Simply throw away the used canister, wipe down the foamer and your done."
5,Now Playing at a GBA near you!!,"I am amazed by today's technology!! I am 36 years old (as I write this), and have grown up with the Original video game systems; The Odyssey; The Intellivision; Coleco Vision; Nintendo; Super Nintendo; Sega Dreamcast; Playstation; Playstation 2; Xbox. Nintendo Gameboy; Sega Game Gear; Nintendo Gameboy Color; Nintendo Gameboy Advance; Nintendo GBA SP; Nintendo GBA DS; PSP.As you can see from my list, video games, and graphics have become awesomely advanced over time. And now, with today's systems such as the PSP and the GBA we can sit back and enjoy a good movie!!Shark Tale. Rated PG for some mild language and crude humor.Starring the voice talents of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee'Zellweger, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Martin Scorsese, Ziggy Marley, Doug E. Doug. Dreamworks Video, and Majesco Entertainment. 90 minutes.Also available for GBAV Movies -- Shrek, and Shrek 2. Both rated PG.GBAV Shark Tale gets two thumbs WAY up!!!"
3,Old school game,I purchased this for a young relative whoinformed me that enjoys playing it fromtime to time. It is worth the price.
2,Very average,"I expected a bit more from a PBS production. Normally this series (""Amercian Experience"") is outstanding, I purchased some Lincoln DVDS and loved them, but I was rather disappointed with this DVD in light of the outstanding subject matter (Washington). Again, I would watch it on tv; I wouldnt buy. Overall, nothing special."
4,Tight in the toe area but that can be adjusted,"I got these for my 13 year old daughter who has a long, slender foot. She wanted to send them back because they were too tight in the toe area. Luckily before I wasted my money on return postage I found a suggestion that said to place a wooden spoon inside the shoe to stretch it out to fit better in the toes. Since these type of dance shoes are supposed to fit snug ordering a larger shoe size isn't recommended. This will most likely result in the shoe being loose and not as good for dance class/practice.The wooden spoon trick worked and my daughter loves these shoes. Worth the extra price spent for a good shoe that will last."
5,My Favorite Ballet Shoe,This is a well-made shoe that has a great fit and durability due to it's combination of leather and lycra. I was disappointed to learn that this shoe is being discontinued.
3,Light Work.,Bowden has cut up previous work for bait and packaged it as a book. Not as interesting as Blackhawk or Pablo or other books by him.
3,Bowden shorts,"Mr. Bowden hasn't write a ""bad"" book that I've read. I knew going in that this was a collection of short stories and I don't normally like to read short stories. However, I really like Mark Bowden's writing style so I thought I'd give this a try. It was worth it. I found some stories very entertaining and better than others. However, A couple I didn't even finish. So I rate this as just O.K.."
5,Can't get enough of this writer,"I enjoy true crime and have read many good true crime books; however, Mark Bowden captures you and pulls you in from Page 1 and doesn't quit right down to the last page. Keep them coming, Mark - you add real class to true crime. One of the best investigative journalists in this day and time."
3,Strawberry Girl,"I liked my bookthe strawberry girl, because the book had and ton of intersiting things that can happen in the book, there is also not alot of conflict or stuff that people don't like to read about,and1 other thing that you don't have to read a bookbecause this book is really intersting the best part in the book would have to when her father always yells at her because she spends too much time with her friends.the setting is mostly out in the farm where they can grow strawberrys and stuff like that.the main character in the book is a ten year old girl named birdie boyer, because she is so cute because she can pick her strawberryin no time at at all that's why they call her the strawberry girl."
3,Strawberry Girl,I read this book over and over as a child. I finally had to purchase it for myself--the adult. It is a good child's book.
4,Used for emergency scene lighting,"I purchased a pair of these lights for emergency scene lighting for our Volunteer Emergency Response Team. With our budget we conld not afford the HID lights. Mounted on a five foot light stand they work better than truck headlights giving a much larger light pattern. I think they are a good low cost 12 volt flood light that could be used in any situation requiring area lighting.Ted Irvin VERT, Team Leader"
1,Misrepresented,"These headlights were represented as 4 in. by 6 in.I needed them to fit into a very specific opening,which they obviously did not !The actual physical dimensions were 7 in. by 5 in.The package was even labeled as 4 in. by 6 in.Not even close to fitting into the required opening.They went back the very next day.My experience with Amazon was great.They sent a return shipping label the very next morning."
3,Not one of the better collections,"This is not one of the better collections of Dr. King's speeches, as these are minor excerpts that are far too short. I would recommed ""The Great March To Freedom"" (1963 Detroit speech, full of barbed humor and excellent points), ""The Great matrch on Washington"" (entire Dream Speech), ""Free At Last"" (Mountaintop Speech) and best of all, the ""A Call To Conscience"" CDs that have all of the above and then some. Also, the breif but powerful Birmingham excerpt from ""Sing For Freedom."""
3,Beware,"I bought this CD, and was very excited BEFORE I got the CD. AFter I heard it, my excitement had dwindeled. If you are planning to buy this CD remember that this only has excerpts from his speaches, meaning that except for 3 of the tracks the majority of the tracks are only about 30sec long. I bought this with the intention that I would be able to hear the whole speach and not just a few seconds of it. If you want the whole speach, do not buy this CD, if you are happy with sound bitz then this is a winner. As for me when I purchased this CD I expected to get some meat--insted I had to settle for a mear appettizer. With the awsome speaches Dr. King spoke, what a pitty to put out a cd that does not do him justice."
3,Missing the learning factor but it's still KING! (3.5 stars),"I was very excited to get this CD home but to my disappointment, some of the tracks were just the very famous MLK. Jr. quote or key on-liners taken out of context from speeches that we really need to know more about. We need to hear more of these speeches just to understand the significance and the strength of King's words and the content of which they came from.However, although most of these speeches are abruptions, King's voice alone does wonders for the soul. At least the ""I Have A Dream Speach"" is given to us in it's entirity."
1,Dissapointment,"Even at $6.99 this CD is over priced. With the exception of ""Address to the American Jewish Committee"" and Dr. King's Entrance into Civil Rights Movement"", all that is provided are very minimal sound bites. The ""I have a Dream Speech"" only includes the final culmination of his address. In order to appreciate Dr. King as an orator, his speeches must be heard from the absolute beginning to the end. What made the I have a Dream Speech so great was the way that Dr. King located his groove and began to flow into his spiritual roots. I was greatly disappointed by this collection."
4,good.,"Im a recent fan of ""minimalist"" music. This was reccomended by Amazon from their classical section. Its quite good. Very tectural and atmospheric. Heavy strings."
5,Great!,"This toy/ electronic device, is great! It may not be very educational, but it gets rid of boring hours and it is really fun. I got it for christmas and it was my favorite present. Now, it's great for vacation and when i'm bored."
1,doesn't come with a hole for an adapter,"I bought this for my grandson and all was great until the batteries ran out--he had an adapter from a previous gameboy advance and I thought based on that, that they all came with a plug-in for an adapter--wrong--I wouldn't have bought it if I knew we had to keep supplying him with batteries. It's an important piece of information that I wished was displayed with the description of the gameboy advance when I purchased it. Grandma Jane"
3,"Simple, Excellent Derivation","After several chapters reviewing concepts, many of which are quite irrelevant to the subsequent discussion, Bondi gives one of the most original derivation of Special Relativity that I have ever seen.Unfortunately, Bondi does make some serious mistakes. For example, he conflates ""time"" and ""elapsed time"", which is analogous to conflating ""position"" and ""distance"". Second, by claiming that the laws of physics only apply to inertial reference frames, I think the author impedes the understanding of general relativity.The author does deserve credit for using the correct formula for time dilation, not the naive gamma factor."
2,Pretty but sheer,"Quite pretty, but I wanted to use this handkerchief to blow my nose. It is reasonably soft after washing, but it is sheerer than the old ones I am trying to replace (they were made in Switzerland many years ago). I will keep looking for soft thick small women's handkerchiefs."
4,Wheres Larry?,Although this cd is credited to Larry Coryell he only plays on 1 track.The cd has lots of quality world fusion music by different artists.The song list has Coryell credited on all the songs this to is incorrect.Although I was misled I enjoyed most of the tracks as will most fans of this type of world music.
4,well recommended,"boy is this good. Never had one of these things before, so nothing to compare it against. I don't know if going with the heavier density is what does the trick: not too soft, yet by no means hard. Just a bit softer than firm, just right. Didn't notice any smell from mine, but I do have a cold a at present. Clear instruction sheet in the box and no trouble whatsoever dealing with this company."
2,Did not meet my expectations,"It did not improve my sleeping comfort. I hoped that throwing this 4lb of density, 3"" topper over my cheap mattress would solve the problem, but it didn't. It's either not dense enough, not thick enough or I'm just too heavy (185 lbs) for this topper. Weird thing is, it feels like it has a better memory on the edges, but when you press it firmly in the middle, it goes back to the original shape instantly. The good thing was it did not come vacuum packed, so I was able to use it immediately, and the odor of chemicals was minimal. After a 3-night trial it goes back to the seller, though."
3,'Mousetrap' good- no Poirot in'Appointment with Death',"The Mousetrap is probably the best in this book, and if you are ever in London, you should definitely go see the play. I found ""Appointment with Death"" quite odd-the play form of the book had nothing to do with Poirot-"
4,Semi difficult build,The open sided platform is difficult to build. Very hard to get the roof supports to stay erect without leaning.
3,"Tattoos rated ""ok"".",These tattoos rub off very quickly. My son was very excited because he loves tattoos and was very thrilled to have shark & dinasour tattoos. He was very upset when it started to rub off before the end of the afternoon. We were very disappointed.
4,Sharks tattoos,"Purchased for my 6 year old nephew, who adores sharks. Did not fail his expectations. Would buy again if there were different packages with other types of shark's."
4,Shark Lover,"My little one loves sharks. Not an easy thing to find all year round. Cool tattoos, wish there were more inside. Still a great product."
4,Awesome tattoos,"At first this item never arrived even though my inbox said they did. Fortunately, they're pretty cheap so I decided to give the seller another try. I'm glad I did because these are AWESOME! The only down side is that they really don't last more than a day. For kicks, they're pretty great."
5,Never run out of yogurt again!,I am so glad that I purchased the extra batch jar. I never run out of yogurt anymore. The convenience is totally worth even double the price!
3,White is not best color for yogurt incubation.,"I purchased one and found it difficult to both open and close completely (360-degrees) without experiencing a good deal of slosh owing to the force required to snap and unsnap the lid.Also, I realized after my purchase, incubating yogurt cultures results in some of them becoming very well attached to the side of the incubation container. One needs to examine well a wash container under good light for signs of minute, clinging clusters. It is difficult to see minute, white cultures on the inside wall of a white container. I now use clear glass, screw top bottles for culturing yogurt. The clinging spots of white are much easier to spot on the clear glass."
5,Extra Batch Jar for the Best Yogurt Maker Ever,"I have been making my own yogurt for over 20 years both the old fashioned way and with yogurt makers. This is my third (and probably final) yogurt maker. Not only does it make a full 64 ounces, but it makes the most consistent batches yet. I am also making cheese from some of the large batches. I have found the extra batch jar a handy addition to my yogurt supplies as I can store yogurt in the same container I make it in. Very handy."
5,Beautiful Ring!!,"If you thought the details on this ring were the most beautiful one on this website, you'd so be right! The ring's detailing is amazing, and everything on the ring is perfectly proportional. I ended up giving my ring to my mom because it was a bit too big (I guess I measured my size wrong).Now this ring isn't made in Ireland (Thailand), but I've had claddagh ring from Ireland (but I lost that while I was moving), and the detail was nowhere near the quality of the detail that's on this ring. The hand shape is especially well crafted.I definitely recommend this product!"
5,Beautiful and delicate,I purchased this for a friend who has always wanted a Claddagh ring. This one is far and away the best I've seen in this price range. Beautifully designed and manufactured. Very delicate features. Highly recommended.
4,Hallelujah!,"Lover's of Vincent Youman's songs will enjoy this collection which includes ""Tea for Two,"" I Want to Be Happy,"" ""Too Many Rings Around Rosey"" and the title song from No, No, Nanette, along with many other treasures from the 20's and 30's like ""More Than You Know."" Decidedly a selection for music and musical buffs of the first half of last century. If you like Berlin, Porter, and Gershwin, you will be happy with this choice."
3,"Not a bad book, but it is first ever returned item!",This book is too simple for most photo enthusiasts who have already grasped the fundamental concepts such as balance and one-third. It doesn't elaborate on any topic.It would be a decent book if you are looking for a beginner book which is simple to read.
4,Juicelady! YUMMY!,"I bought the Juicelady a couple of months ago, and it works wonders. The engine is great, and shreads even the thickest of carrots with ease. The juicer extracts the juice, and lets you enjoy the yummy juice without any pulp of any kind. I love pulp, but man, this lady is a great juicelady! The only problem I have with this machine is the cleanup. The machine is quite large. The worst part is cleaning the net container. Those who own this know what I'm talking about. I suggest you use a toothbrush when cleaning the net."
4,Great!,"I just used this machine for the first time and chose it from its good reviews written here. I am glad I did. I was skeptical, but this is a definite bang for the buck. It's super easy to clean with a vegetable brush. The easiest I've ever had to clean. You can fit large carrots through it without cutting them thin -saving on time and aggravation. The white parts will stain, but any juicers white parts stain and there is a solution for this. The stainless steel shines great. My only complaint, the pulp is not as dry as I would like it. But it's better than the amount left with the cheap ones (and I've had my share). The only way to avoid wet pulp is to spend 500++ (My parents have a nice one)Middle of the line middle of the line pulp dryness. No vibration with my first time use, no pulp in the juice, and smooth running. To sum it up.....I'm glad I made the investment."
3,A disappointment,"I've had a Juicelady for maybe 9 or 10 years. I use it frequently. It does well with hard items (carrots, apples, beets), but does a poor job with greens. My other complaint is putting the parts together. The ring is flimsy and hard to fit together with the top piece, causing a lot of frustration. I have just ordered a new Breville Elite Juicer, based on large numbers of positive reviews and the quality of construction. I am looking forward to using that one and getting rid of the one I have now. The Breville has a larger feed tube, thus minimizing the time spent cutting fruits and vegetables. The Juicelady may have been a good buy when it was first introduced. But I think newer brands have big improvements, including a strainer on the pitcher which keeps the froth from getting into your drinking glass. Overall, don't buy this one. Go with the Breville."
1,Juicer did not work,Received juicer and proceeded to slice and skin vegetables. I went to turn the product on and nothing. Electronic failure. Nothing happened.Quality control? Shipping?...Outfit?
3,O.K. Book,"The main reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that in the beginning there was absolutely NO excitment. The children don't go on magic adventures, just do a few harmless good deeds. They don't even know if they're magic is real. Half Magic and Seven-Day magic are a lot better than this."
3,Interesting or Not?,"Magic or Not was not the greatest book. It was a little boring and sometimes too much detail. They had some adventures but the adventures were boring, dull, and unexciting, and some didn't have enough detail."
3,"Well said ,well magic...","In this book Mr. Eager introduces us to James, Laura, Kip, Lydia, Deborah and Gordy....not to mention the magic of the wishing well. In this book James and Laura have just moved to the country from New York. They are both excited about this move. A move to the country, for them, signals the beginning of adventure. They find adventure, too, when Lydia suggests to Laura to make a wish upon the well in hers' and James' new backyard. Some of the good deed adventures in this book are exciting, some are not; however, interesting insight is offered into each character-which will come in handy when reading ""The Well Wishers"", the sequel."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"I have read Half Magic and Knights Castle and just finished Magic Or Not?, and out of those three, my favorite is Magic Or Not? I recomend this book for all children who can read (and adults too)!"
4,Delightful Book,"I remember this book from years past. It was good to re-visit it again. My only wish was that it was available through iBooks, too."
2,doesnt fit well,have to shove my iphone 4 in and it doest cover it all the way and is very tight to get phone in... does not work well and only tried to use it for a few weeks.. then tossed it unfortunately
2,works but.....,The system is easy to mount and the cymbal is easy to attach BUT the mounting system TOTALLY ruins the thread even after just one tightening! They need to find a better system to secure it to the stand or even a thread though different brand use different sizes....
5,great cleaner,this product works great - had some off white cushions that had signicant dirt - this cleaner worked wonders - they really look like new - I read the other reviews and was hopeful - now I am a believer
5,Wonderfull!!!!!!!!!,I choose this for my Sunbrella fabric outdoors rolling awning in order to clean the fabric from the weathers harmful elements. What a product!
5,Excellent product; well made and easy to assemble,This commercial quality paper dispenser and cutter is made of metal and can be set up as either a wall-mounted or table top work station. Very simple and easy to understand directions.
4,Great Toy!!,I purchased this toy as a Christmas gift for my nephew. He loved it. I have heard no complaints from his parents.
3,Disgusted,"I ordered the used version of this book expecting it to be in moderate condition. It. was. terrible. The spine was bent, and when I took off the cover I found green liquid smeared on it which smelled a little like vomit. I wil never buy another used book from this site again.."
5,Drums of Autumn,The Outlander Series is one of the best series I have ever read. I can't put them down. Diana Gabaldon has done an excellent job portraying the main characters of Jamie and Clare. Men can take a lesson from Jamie on what women want in a relationship. It was stated perfectly...I have seen a marriage of obligation and a marriage of love...I want the marriage of love.The story plots are great and you immediately get caught up in the drama. Awesome!
4,Drums of Autumn (Outlander),"This is a great book so far, love reading about James Fraser and looking to reading the section with his daughter."
4,Good but not as good as the others,I love this series. I found this book to not be as good as the previous but definitely worth a read if you like the Outlander Series. It sets the stage for what is coming more than has an interesting story line I believe.
5,Each novel gets better!,"This is a wonderful series - both romance, science fiction and historical. Seven books published in this series so far - and am impatiently waiting for #8!!!"
5,compelling,It took me 4 months to read this book -- just because I don't have much time to read. It is a real luxery for me. I had to order the next book in the series before I finished this one.I keep wanting to know what will happen next with Jamie and Claire...just when I think it's going to get boring it picks up once again. I'm amazed that Diana Gabaldon can write so much about essentially two (now four) characters and keep ones interest! She's a prolific and a brilliant author.Her books are so large I need to get a kindle so I can take it anywhere :)I was not disappointed with Drums of Autumn and will keep reading her series.
2,ghost of a book,in the prologue-the author writes about ghosts. and that is what his book is. if you have enjoyed the first three books then don't read this one. it is long and winding and not half fun as the first three.the parts told in third person are paticularly painful-bree is not half interesting as her mother and roger is no jamie.if the auhtor had stuck to her first person accounts then this would have not been half as bad as it turnd out to be.
4,North Carolina Highlanders,"I found this book the most fascinating of the series so far. As a descendant of North Carolina Highlander Scots, I felt that the book gave me real insight into what my ancestors' lives may have been like as they settled the area, interacting with the Native Americans, and establishing a new nation. I could never before understand why they stayed in rural NC for over 200 years on their land. The story is very dramatic, fantastic and magical. I'd waited six months to read this one, but I won't wait very long to read the next one. Drums definitely made it well worth working through the thousands of pages of the first three books to get to it. Wonderful things happen."
5,Great continuation,"This is a great book and a wonderful continuation. It is book 4 in the series. I couldn't wait to read more about Jamie, Claire, Roger and Brianna. This book answers a lot of questions from the previous ones and has a lot of nice suprises!!!"
3,Long winded,"Much too wordy for my wife; never finished the book, However, father-in-law likes the book and series of book by Gabaldon!"
4,Autumn,Book arrived in very good condition. Reading this one now and going through the whole series. Happy with my purchase.
3,"Wordy, wordy, wordy!!!","I decided to read the 4th book in hopes that the author's pace would heighten and her wordiness would lessen. 500 pages later, the plot and the characters finally began to pick up. I believe that the author couldn't decide whether this series should be in the romance section or a work of historical fiction. Too bad she chose the former route."
3,Needs Editing,"I have enjoyed all the books in the Outlander series. This was the weakest. What was her editor thinking about letting her go on for so long. It should have been trimed down into a normal sized book and it would have been wonderful. Robert Graves where are you now that we need you. (He edited David Copperfield). I will certainly buy the others. She is a wonderful writer, but this book was self indulgent."
2,A Great Disappointment!,"As other reviewers stated, the first three books were so wonderful I stayed up all night reading them. I started this one, and kept thinking, ""Well, maybe it will get better soon,"" finally (actually pretty quickly) deciding I would rather sleep. As a comment one year after receiving this for Xmas 97, while I've read and re-read the other books, this one continues to gather dust on my bookshelf."
2,Just a bit out of sorts...,"While the first three books held me captive (I couldn't read them fast enough), I was disappointed with the long awaited ""Drums."" The magic between Jamie and Claire was missing as if they were part of the story because we expected them to be there. There were many lost opportunities to develop the relationship between Jamie and Brianna and the relationship between Brianna and Roger. I think the novel would have been more interesting if Brianna and Roger had not gone into the past, but continued their search for Jamie and Claire in the history books and continued their lives together. Diana Gabaldon is an excellent author but it seems that this novel was put together without a lot of thought to the characters themselves. The characters did not act as they had in the previous novels. I hope that the next novel, if it comes to pass, continues on with the characters as they were originally written."
5,Terrific,"If you like historical romance that is heavy on the adventure this book was written for you. Ironically, I'm not a fan of the romance genre at all, but this series of books provided such excellent adventure and suspense as well as knowledge of herbal lore that they drew me in."
5,Great read!,"Diana Gabaldon delivers another favorite with Drums of Autumn. Claire is smart, funny, sexy - what more could a woman want? It truly is difficult to pigeonhole any of the Outlander books into one specific genre, and Drums of Autumn is no different. I love that there's something for everyone in her books. Diana Gabaldon does not shy away from any subject matter, that I can see, and I admire that in an author as long as it's well done (and it is). I've recommended this series to many, many friends and I always love to get their excited feedback. The books are ginormous, but then that's another thing I love about them."
3,"the story's still interesting, but....","Like many others I waited impatiently for the next installment in this series. When it finally came out I was a little bit disappointed. There's a lot of action in the book, but I thought much of it was rather improbable (but, then again, isn't time travel improbable?).I'm still a fan, and will wait impatiently for the next book, but I did enjoy the first four books more than ""The Fiery Cross.""I just hope we don't have to wait as long for the next installment!!"
2,"Yes, this is the weak link","The fourth in the Outlander series. Claire, a 20th century Englishwoman steps through a circle of stones and is transported 200 years back in time, where she falls in love with 18th century Scotsman, Jamie Fraser. Some reviewers comment that this is the weak link in the series. I agree. While Jamie and Claire fascinate me, and I cannot get enough of them, there were other characters who did not interest me at all. Overall, this is an excellent author."
5,The best series I've ever read - exceedingly captivating!,"The best series I've ever come across for romance novels - wonderful and intriguing characters. A series of tales that keep your eyes red at night from late-nite reading, characters that make you laugh out loud, and cry at their tragedies. You become engulfed with Clare & Jamie and their adventures and their everbinding everlasting love for one another - they become a part of you. I'm not sure I can wait until #5! Besides the fact that I simply must visit Scotland now!"
5,awesome!! thrilling!!! a must read!!!!,"This fourth book in the series just leaves you aching for more about the lives of Jamie and Claire. If you read this book and have read the other books in the series, you will know. It is an absolute page turner!!! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you gasp in outrage, and it will leave you wanting more!!!! It is just a fabulous book that will make you believe that that kind of passionate love does exist for us out there. It will make you fall in love with love!!! Diana Gabaldon is wonderful!!!!"
5,"But wait, there's more!","For all of you Jamie and Claire fans: you must read Sara Donati's book ""Into the Wilderness"". It is written in the same style at (almost) the same level. Our favourite couple even makes an appearance!! Diana Gabaldon was quoted on the cover and that's why I picked it up. What a treat. (It is about a fiesty couple in 18th cent. New England)"
3,slower than the first,Drums is a good book....but by far the best written was Outlander..that book captured your imagination and heart all in one. Drums didnt capture your imagination like the Outlander or Dragonfly in Amber. It did alot of droning on about insignifact things..and the misunderstanding with Jamie and Roger and sending Roger off like that..that part wasnt the greatest scene. But now Brianna and Roger are breaking in a new Mckenzie clan. And there is still the Revolutionary War to happen. Knowing Jamie...he will get caught up in that somehow. I am anxiously awaiting the 5th. After reading the other reviews..i too believe that a movie can be made...but why Kevin Sorbo? I think Adrian Paul should play Jamie..and he is Scots..and maybe Sean Connery can play one of the older characters..maybe Colum.
5,Loved it as Usual.,I bought the hard backs until I got an iPad and started reading on that so I purchased the entire set (6 at that time) and started all over again enjoying the series.
5,great books,If you are looking for a book to keep you captivated then this series is for you! I feel like this could be a true story!!
3,Jamie and Claire are wonderful!,"Diana Gabaldon has done a wonderful job in bringing Jamie and Claire to life. I don't want their lives to end. However, Drums of Autumn was more difficult to get through. I found the book to be too descriptive. Still, I can't wait for more! Please don't let ""The Fiery Cross"" be the end Jamie and Claire."
5,Four to Score!,"This is the 4th episode in the Outlander Series. Glad it isnt the last! There are so many side stories to keep your interest and the characters are vivid. Of course, it continues the story of Jamie and Claire and what a story it is! This series is so refreshingly different from the standard 'historical romances' they should not even be labeled as such! I've read the 4 books over the summer and am glad to have the opportunity to catch up on my sleep waiting for the 5th book in November. Diana ends each chapter with a lure to go on to the next, thereby delaying chores, sleep etc. etc. Good author! Diana, you are amazing!"
3,Feeling manipulated,I have enjoyed the characters in the Outlander series but have now begun to feel manipulated by slow moving plot lines and long descriptions of landscapes.
3,Fan of series but this one missed the mark,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books in this series. I just finished Book 4 ""Drums of Autumn"" and think it really didn't live up to the previous books. There were parts of this book that were wonderful, but it tended to wander off track. Several chapters could have been deleted entirely and it wouldn't have hurt the overall story. Toward the end, I started skimming a bit because things just seemed to move too slowly -- the whole episode with the Mohawks was entirely unnecessary and really off track. I think I will take a break before tackling the next three installments."
3,Not as good as the others,"I honestly didn't enjoy this one as much as the previous three. This book takes place in the colonies, but Jamie and Clare really belong in Scotland. I am eagerly looking forward to the next book and hopeful they will get back where they belong."
3,Inconsistent,"This book has its truly good parts, but quite a bit of it is boring. A big disappointment after the previous books. It's almost as if the two main characters are now together and settled, so the author does not know what to do with them. (Why fairy tales say simply `They lived happily ever after' - What's more boring than two beautiful people gleefully changing diapers?)"
5,LOVED IT!,Could not put the book down - Diana Gabaldon's books are the best. The Outlandish Series are the first books that I MUST have in hardback
5,Enjoyed it tremendously,"I anxiously awaited the debut of this book. It was amazing how the day-to-day life of the characters could be so interesting. The characters seem so real that you find yourself wondering how their lives will be in the next book. I understand it takes awhile to write a book this good, but I wish the author would give a bit more of the old history that happend in previous novels so that I don't have to remember so much detail from a book that I read 2 years ago. Thanks again for a great boo"
3,DO NOT READ BEVERLEY STRONG'S REVIEW...,"It is dated February 2002. With no doubt the best of intentions, Beverley has managed to give away the entire plot!! Why has this review been given 14 helpful votes?!! I do not understand."
3,Not at par with the previous books,"I enjoyed the Outlander series, and read the first three books in about two weeks. This fourth book is an unnecessary continuation of the series. For lovers of Claire and Jamie's story, it would have been best to end the series after Book 3.The newly evolving characters don't make a lot of sense, and seemed to move between centuries so easily, adapting without any trouble at all. The storyline didn't seem historical, and seemed like a modern story happening in the 18th century.I kept hoping it would improve towards the end, but I was disappointed. I'll keep my memories of the move to America as the start of a new life for Jamie and Claire, and read no more of this series."
5,EXCELLENT!,"Truly beyond expectation and Diana has raised the bar of what you can expect from her! She is a true artist. Love, adventure, history, family, loyalty, betrayal......and the greatest of these is love. Men really love this series. It speaks to men and women alike. You feel like you are actually a part of the lives of Jamie and Claire!"
4,The necessary link,"As promised in previous reviews, I will also keep this one short, sweet and to the point.Firstly, I must state that this volume HAS to exist.Bree and Roger have appeared in the previous books, but their links to this tale have not been forged as strongly, simply because the story had not yet required it to do so.Well .... in this one they bring it home and finally become important players in the Outlander series.I adore Roger - and personally, without him, Bree would be too big'a chunk to swallow sometimes. (Another itty-bitty reason this volume needed)Again, as I have said in previous reviews - this one cannot be missed if you are intending to follow the tale to the end.Get into it people - there is plenty more to follow.Cheers - Jo"
5,Wonderful story all the way through.,"I've recently finished reading the entire series. What I enjoyed the most about this series is that it took so long for me to read. I have trouble getting interested in new authors and new stories which why I was so thrilled to see how exceptional these books are. I have always liked historical fiction, especially when it is realistic and personal. This final book is just as good as the other three and I hope to see a new installment sometime soon."
4,Good Book but not as good as the first three,I liked this book but didn't like it as well as the first 3 books in this series. I didn't like Brianna and Roger. I guess I am having a hard time accepting Jamie and Claire getting older too. I felt there wasn't as much time spent on Jamie and Claire as Brianna and Roger which I didn't like. I'm hoping there will be a book 5 out because there are still some unanswered questions. Like how did Jamie kill Randall? Or did he? What happened to Jamie's son? I'll be looking forward to my questions answered.
3,Still essential reading...,"I love the Outlander series and I devoured this book as quickly as the others. But, for the first time, I felt that the story was running out of steam. The novel introduces the time travel thing again, this time it is Roger and Brianna who make the leap into the Eighteenth Century to hunt for Jamie and Claire. This is where the book was a real cliffhanger as the reader cannot wait to read the reunion between Jamie and Brianna.It then stumbles for the last third waiting for its resolution. I will not say why since anyone who has not read the book would kill me! I think it is right that the focus has now moved on to Brianna and Roger but their love story has not been as well fleshed out as that of Jamie and Claire. However, if you love the Outlander books, you are not gonna care a hoot - you will love this and will not be able to put it down until it is over."
5,book,"Great used book in a wonderful series. Good service, excellent price, quick delivery. If you haven't discovered books by Diana Gabaldon, you are missing a rich reading experience. These books are big (800+ pages in each book of this series), and expensive to buy new."
3,Disappointed,"I LOVED the first 3 books in the Outlander series, but was somewhat disappointed in this book. It wasn't terrible, but wasn't great."
5,continued saga of Jaime and Claire,Just love following the lives of these people. I could imagine exactly what the tijme was like for them. Wonderful series
5,Awesome!,Best series I have ever read! I have read this series all the way through at least 6 times and get more out of it each time. So much great history and an inside look of what life was like so many years ago. Definitely an awesome read! Can't wait for the new one to come out next year!
5,Voyager,"Not since the ""Exorcist"" have I read anything so addicting. Diana's style of writing is not only entertaining, but also makes the reader feel that the storyline could REALLY have happened. (?) I must admit I'm half-way through the 3rd book of series, and logged onto the Kindle site to take a sneak-peek at the 4th book. I just KNEW Jamie and Claire would find each other again. Looking forward to downloading each book of the series. Just too fantastic."
4,Take as much time as you need for the next book...,"After reading some of the other reviews (which I did not do until after I finished the book), I realize that my feelings are shared by many. While I devoured this book like I did the previous three, I felt at times that I was just ""reading to be reading"". I wasn't really the whole book which made me feel that way, just parts. I know that with any series, a reader starts to predict and forcast events and actions. I think I got caught doing this a lot. For example, I pictured Brianna to be EXACTLY like her father. Well, she wasn't, and it was probably a bit unrealistic to think she would be. She is female, and Claire was very different from Jamie. Anyway, I still love the series and look forward to the next book..."
4,"""Drums"" lacks passion of previous books.","It is not easy to have Jamie and Claire growing older. I was hoping that the book would draw us to Brianna and Roger the same way we were drawnto Jamie and Claire. I was expecting the same level of passion that Jamie and Claire had always had. I found John Grey to be a very interesting and diverse. Diana Gabaldon is a great romance novelist. I hope the demand for the book did not pressure her to finish ""Drums""sooner than she would have liked. We are anxiously awaiting the next book, however, we will wait longer if it is necessary!"
5,Outlander Series,The Outlander series by Dianna Gabledon is incredible. It is based on an accidental time traveler with a medical background who travels back in time 200 years to Scotland. The adventures and LOVE STORY that unfold are wonderful. I am not one to read the same thing a second time but these books are so GREAT I have read the entire series (5 or 6 books) 3 times and have learned something new and exciting every time. If you like time travel you will love these books!
5,The series that just keeps getting better and better,"Drums of Autmun continues the story of Claire and Jamie and all of the other characters that we have come to know and love in the first three books.As with the first three books, Diana's attention to historical details is amazing and so well done if the characters were real people you would think you were reading a history book!A series that just keeps getting better and better as the books go one, the fourth one is just as hard to put down as the first three"
5,Where's the next one?,"My mother and I exchange books, and she had given me ""DRUMS"" to read. Not knowing, or looking, that this was a series of books, I read the book in a weekend, I could not put it down! The characters are so spell-binding! Then to find out that there are books that precede, I was at the library before I finished ""DRUMS""! But I couldn't stop reading the fourth book, and have now read & re-read all of the books. I only wish my husband was more like Jamie Fraser! Ah, to have lived in that time, when men were men and women were women! And life was what you made of it, it's makes me think that we all need to be a little like Jamie & Claire. Diana, if you read this, please we are all waiting patiently for FIERY CROSS, but I for one need another book to read! Please hurry!"
5,Fantastic!,"Diane Gabaldon is at the top of my ""I've read every book and loved it"" list of authors. The stories, and adventures Jamie and Claire have keep me on my toes to the last page of the book (which I usually can't put down until I've finished it). I have recommended these books to anyone I know, and they have all loved them. I look forward to the next installment. Keep writing them, because we'll keep reading them, and loving every word"
5,BREATH-TAKING,"I've read the other three books and ""Drums of Autunm"" is just as good as them. Once you pick it up, you cannot put it down. I read it and I read it again. Gabaldon had a way with words that really touchs the heart. This book and the others in the series have a way of drawing you in and itching to know what is going to happen next. You feel as if you are a part of the story line. WELL DONE DIANA GABALDON.TWO THUMBS UPEXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I found ""Drums"" quite disappointing in the context of the first books. The plotline has meandered to a slow trickle in places. I have mentioned in my reviews for ""Voyager"" and ""The Fiery Cross"" that I have found Diana Galbadon's writing style in her later novels very self-indulgent, and ""Drums"" had a number of sub-plots that didn't seem to bear relevance to the main story. The character of Brianna doesn't quite gel with me, Diana Galbadon mentioned in her ""companion"" to the novels (Through the Stones) that she found Brianna a ""hard nut to crack"" character-wise and I think this shows in the novel - the psyche of this character doesn't come across, and it is difficult to feel sympathy or affection for her. Roger's character is also a little difficult to warm to, compared to those of say Young Ian and Fergus. All in all - stick with the first three books!"
2,Waaaaay too long and boring,"This book goes on and on and on, and never is there ever any serious conflict. Too much GD pillow talk, and too much needless description of leaves and plants and sunsets and god knows what else. Sooooo boring!!! Badly written romance at its least romantic."
1,An Author's Excess Bores This Reader,"While reading this book I could hear the author straining in the background. Better throw in a rape, a bear, an indian attack, a storm. The melodrama was over the top. These piled on events were interspersed with long boring stretches like where Claire grows penicillin or describes the mountain. At one point I stopped reading to count the adjectives. You can skip 20 pagers at a clip and miss nothing. I won't be reading another."
2,Jack Randall saved this series...,"... and his absence killed it. When I read the first book in this series, A Dragonfly in Amber, I was happily suprised that it wasn't a run-of-the-mill, formulaic romance. The characters were shockingly three-dimensional and the antagonist was, well, a bad guy with a face behind the black moustache, so to speak.Well, sequels have been disappointing, not least Drums of Autumn. Brianna has the personality of a paperdoll compared to her mother, and unfortunately a great deal of the book revolves around her. Likewise, her love interest is only slightly more charismatic.In summary, don't miss the first book of this series but don't bother with the rest."
1,"I won&#65533;t say, because I didn&#65533;t finish the book","There are people calling this a great book. What? Excuse me? I don't think so. This book has no plot, action, or anything that would even be considered remotely good. I don't know how people could ever want to read it.Actually, the book is a -1, but hey, whose counting? I couldn't even finish the book, it was so dumb. But if the sort of book that you like is the one that doesn't make you think or be excited, this book is the right one for you."
3,Jamie and Claire were wonderful but they rest was slow.,I loved the way Jamie and Claire were written. They are my favorite charaters. I feel like I;m right there with them. Brianna and Roger were alright. Some of the book was really slow. I loved Outlander and Vogager though. I still plan to buy any more books in this series. I also plan to read this again.
5,Drums of Autumn,"Need to read the series in order. A wonderful treat of six large novels following each other, that makes for many hours of great reading."
4,Filled with super cool info on the Cards,"This book is a must for any intermediate/advanced student of Destiny Cards system. Although the info is a little hard to understand at first, as you learn more about this amazing ancient science, you'll refer to this book and gain a greater understanding."
4,Old School Street Punk at its finest,"One Way System was among the finest Punk bands in Britain in the late 70s and early 80s. Compared to most of today's ""Streetpunk"" bands, nothing can compare to the original sounds bands like this came up with. There are some bands today than can pull it off fairly well...Oxymoron comes to mind, but all in all most bands with the ""Streetpunk"" lable just don't get it after you listen to the UK82 bands a little bit. I put this Disc right up there with one of my very favorite English Streetpunk bands, the legendary Major Accident! Although not AS good, this one definately belongs up there. The songs are loud, vicious, aggresive, and unlike some punk out there, each song sounds different then the next. If you like bands like Oxymoron, Hudson Falcons, Dropkick Murphys, then check these guys out because this is the TRUE sounds of Punk Rock!"
4,Maybe 4 & 1/2 stars; excellent resolution to series,"Each book in this trilogy improved upon the last. Readers of the first 2 books will welcome Nicola's turn at love -- and will enjoy meeting ""The Gentleman"" highwayman again. Although Jack's distrust of Nicola is sometimes annoying, his sensitivity and goodness overcome it. Their passion ignites the pages, and the suspense is dealt with a sure hand.The saga of evil Richard is concluded satisfactorily, and it is indeed pleasant to have all the main players from the first two books here to take a hand in the outcome. Justice prevails, true love reigns supreme, and the good are rewarded with happiness.After reading this one, I would consider rereading book 1 to see if I'd rate it higher now. I am left, thanks to book three, with a very pleasant, satisfied feeling."
1,Crap,"Another disappointing item from Amazon. Sometimes I think they pay people to write good reviews.I bought this item based on the reviews and thought it would give me the support and height I need. I have a round hunk of useless foam inside a square shell. The foam is so ""loose"" that it smushes down to about a half inch thick. Totally useless. Not as expected. I wound up making my own cushion."
5,Good price for something not easy to find at hardware stores,"I have a Maglite which stopped working about three months ago and have been looking at hardware stores ever since for a new bulb (I could have replaced the flashlight itself, but it seems a shame to throw it away). As another reviewer noted, it is not easy to find these replacement bulbs at Home Depot and the like. So when I came across these, at a really good price, and there are two of them, I ordered them immediately.Installed one of them into the flashlight - and it works! And now I have a replacement stand-by bulb, too. Definitely recommend these - and probably a good idea to buy them BEFORE the one in your flashlight gives up."
3,For beginners,"You have to remember that this is ""for dummies"". This is really a beginners introduction to politics. For those who already have an understanding of it, there is no need to read this book. After reading the book, I got the impression that the author herself did not have enough political experience to write a book on politics, even for people new to the subject. Really just basic information that anyone could learn simply by watching cspan a few times and watching the news regularly. The book can also become sidetracked and go off topic with its side-subjects, and its sybols can be hard to remember and are often misplaced. Again, only for beginners and not for people with prior knowledge of the subject."
2,A really bad read,"I'm really disappointed in this book and would not recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the basics of politics.There seemed to be many gaps of elementary information missing from this book. Such as, there was no discussion of term limits for elected officials (federal). How long the terms were for was discussed but not a word on the limits.Also, I understand this book was written by a woman but this author's over use of the pronouns 'her' and 'she' drove me nuts. Okay, we get it females play a part in politics but the conventional way would have been to use 'his' or 'he'.I'll be returning this book."
1,Author Should Be Ashamed!,"This book is terribly Democratically biased. I find it horrible and irresponsible for the author to list ""characteristics"" shared by party members whereby she paints a picture of the parties as she sees them (rich, men, white... versus highly educated, working-class, women...) which should have absolutely no relevance. She says ""some voters will feel more comfortable in a party where they don't fit the profile"". I assume she meant some will feel more comfortable where they do fit the profile. Shouldn't the ""profile"" be based on the beliefs that the party stands for? Sad."
1,Biased - therefore dangerous to the novice,"A ""Dummies"" book--especially on a topic as subjective as politics--should present a clear, unbiased foundation of the subject matter, taking pains to flag opinion from fact. This book is dangerous because it is targeted at the uninitiated, and because the biased opinion of the author is presented casually as matter-of-fact information. Hence, the reader walks away with a headfull of propaganda mistaken for fact.It's always a good idea to read about the author (you can do so in the editorial reviews page for this book) before delving into an unfamiliar topic. For a book like this, I strongly recommend it."
2,Ok but biased,"This book does have some very good information in it for someone looking to understand more about politics. The reason I rated this only two stars is because you should know that it is certainly written with a party bias. I've started learning more about politics over the last year and now know enough to recognize that there are Democratic ideals being pushed throughout the book. My concern is that this book is intended for ""dummies"" and so many readers may not pick up on the continuous subtle (and some not so subtle) pro-Democrat, anti-Republican examples and comments. I won't list examples here because I disagree completely with what she says. If you buy this book, you will learn more about politics but keep this bias in mind."
1,Pharmacology Secrets,"This book is quite a disappointment for ""the secrets"" series. This Anthony lady rated her own book explaining that you will learn a lot, and so much important information is missing. You can't use it for anything... much unnecessary detail is put into it. This book is rubbish, so I recommend you stay away."
5,An excellent reveiw of pharmacology,"This book is a terrific mix of basic pharmacology and lesser known information important for competent prescribing and care. An appendix with basic physiology review is included, which is also helpful. It would be useful to the practicing physician and would be an excellent review source for board exams in pharmacology. Want to learn something? Get this book."
4,African Spirtuality,Very nice book. Borrowed it from the library and was able to read and understand the book. I plan on renewing the book so I can read over some parts again.
4,Backpack Purse,Is was a little longer than I expected but very roomy. I had to figure out a way to make it fit a petite person when wearing it as a backpack.
4,Extremely fine performances of an eclectic collection.,"Mizrahi's strong tenor makes for very exciting listening, with items ranging from gregorian-chant -like ancient melodies to more popular 20th century works. The disc makes for a remarkable tour of jewish liturgical music."
2,Ho-Hum,I wanted some rousing marching music. This album is half asleep. The sound quality is poor. Apparently Mr. Williams writes better music than he conducts.
1,better think before !!,"The record quality is really bad. If you like to listen to music and if you got a ""middle-good"" equipment, you will hear a lot of noises and interferences. I love to listen to clear music. This CD was disappointing.By the way... sorry for my poor english."
3,it's okay,50% of songs fall short. Good back ground music but nothing stands out.nothing to brag about as far as recommending to buy
2,Very Dissapointing.....,"Rosa is the other side of the coin of Benoni's tale. Whereas Benoni was the hero of ""his"" book, he's the goat of ""hers."" I think part of what I didn't like about this book was that a character I really loved was taken and made a mockery of. Hamsun seems more driven to show Rosa's spitefulness & hatred, which gets in the way of his usually beautifully simplistic style. Instead of having the easy-going flow of most of his ""small Norweigen fishing village"" novels, it's more of a vitriolic diatrabe. Hamsun is one of the most brilliant novelists of all-time, but this is definately my least-favorite work of all his works translated into English. If you're a Hamsun lover, go ahead & get it. If you've never read Hamsun before, this definately isn't a good place to start."
1,Dangerous appliance!,"I have wanted this mixer for 30 years. I finally bought it as a Christmas present to myself two weeks ago. I made a few batches of Christmas cookies and was very impressed. Today, I was making a double batch of oatmeal cookies (the mixer is really not large enough for this!) and as I was scraping the sides of the bowl, I noticed something shiny in the batter. It turned out to be shavings from the silver strip around the mixer head. I ran my finger around the silver strip and ended up slicing the end of my finger. Needless to say, between the silver shavings and my bleeding finger, the cookie dough went in the garbage. I can not believe that an appliance that cost so much money can be made with such shoddy workmanship. I am so disappointed. .... This mixer is going back and I don't think I will ever trust anything from KitchenAid again!"
3,Working Again - Update,"See original text below. Just wanted to say this mixer is working great since the fix. We grind meat, grain and make our own pizza dough.I love kitchen gadgets. This broken mixer (Broke after two uses) was handed down to me so that I could use the accessories. I took the mixer apart to find a stripped worm gear (the only non-metal gear). It was going to cost about $100 to get it fixed. I ordered the part and did the job myself [...]. It works great now!"
5,Wished I bought it earlier...,"I have one of these mixers and it is fun to use it. From whipped cream to the toughest sourdough, its all an easy task for this sturdy mixer. It is amazingly easy to clean it and it is setup in no time. I love to watch it toying with my extra tough bread dough. Putting on the pouring shield is not exactly an intuitive process in my opinion. The maschine is apparently build to last a long time ! Don't hesitate to order it ! It will make you happier."
5,The only mixer you will ever buy!,"Buy this mixer and you will never need to buy another! I have burnt out 3 mixers but my Kitchen Aid never quits. It is so powerful my husband calls it my ""cement mixer"". If the price looks high, don't worry you will soon realize what a great investment you have made. If you havn't noticed there isn't a cook on TV that dosn't have one of these mixers."
3,Great Mixer - but not for heavy/big jobs,"My husband purchased this mixer for me several years ago. Since it is SO HEAVY, and I had too little counter space, it sat unused a lot (under the sink) until about a year ago. Once I got into the habit of using it, I never wanted to go back to a hand mixer! It was easily my favorite appliance until I started making bread with it. The first time I tried it, I thought it might levitate off the counter! After the 3rd/4th attempt at bread dough, it broke (just as several other reviewers) where engine turns but tools do not. I would not attempt bread dough! But for every other use, its fabulous!"
3,"Real workshorse and looks nice, but read on......","I have owned three 4-1/2 quart KA mixers. The first is twenty years old, runs fine, and is very quiet. The two newer mixers are extremely noisy, perhaps due to the more powerful motors. One of the new ones was so noisy I sent it back to KitchenAid for an exchange. The replacement they sent was even noisier. The trim ring on one of the new ones fell off and was full of oil. KitchenAid has a known problem with oil leakage and trim rings falling off. Go to their web site and see for yourself. I now have a 5 quart KA mixer. It is noisier than the 4-1/2 quart models. Better buy some ear plugs too."
4,No wonder it's on all the cooking shows!,"I have drooled over this for years and now I have one! Yes, it was worth all the anticipation. First of all, it looks like fine art on your counter top. Even my husband walks up to go ""ahhh"" and pet it! Second of all, the planetary action is fun to watch! Third of all, it really does mix better. Tried and true recipes I've been making for years turned out better after I began using this mixer. And less of my food sticks to the beater. The only downside that I can see is that because the mixer is located exactly in the middle of the bowl, it can be a little tricky getting new ingredients in WHILE you're mixing. I can help feeling like there's a knack I'll have to learn watching Emeril or something. ;o) Shop around--you can find deals."
5,Best applicance ever!!,"I'm a guy who loves to cook! I purchased the KtichenAid Stand Mixer, and I absolutely love it... it's wonderful! I had always wanted one but wouldn't buy one due to the price. Well, I finally broke down and bought one and I haven't regretted it once. The only thing I regret is the fact that I waited so long to buy one. From mixing a meatloaf, to hot crabdip this thing is great. Best of all it mixes up my home-made cheesecake batter perfectly! I highly recommend this to anyone that loves to cook."
5,The Ultimate Kitchen Gadget!,"We received this as a wedding present and couldn't be happier with it. It can help you make anything from mashed potatoes and cookies to pie crusts and bread. Anything you can think of, this mixer can make. It has been a total lifesaver for me - especially since I am completely cooking impared. While my first batch of cookies was a total disaster - I used the wrong attachment - everything since then has actually been quite beautiful. I don't know what I would do without this mixer."
3,A little disappointed,"For years, I lusted after this mixer and I finally got one for a wedding present 2 years ago. Sadly, yesterday I was making bread using the dough hook that comes with the mixer and the motor burned out."
4,"great, but not as much capacity as one would think","This is a great machine. It does everything very well. However, be aware that the capacity may not be as big as it seems to be. This is especially true for bread dough, where you really can't fill up the entire bowl, or the dough will end up climbing up over the hook and clogging the mixer. I can just *barely* make 2 normal-size loaves of bread at once in this mixer. So if you are looking to prepare very large quantities of food at once, I might look at the 5- or 6- quart mixer instead."
2,great name however not very good product,our mixer lasted ten months before it fell apart the chrome ring fell off as we were making cookies not a very good sign for a product like kitchenaid
2,bad quality control,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND AFTER SHE REMOVED IT FROM THE BOX I TOOK A LOOK AT IT TO CHECK IT OVER AND I DISCOVERED THERE WAS MISSING PAINT WHERE THE BAND IS THAT GOES AROUND THE TOP OF THE MIXER. DO I GET THE FEELING THAT THE MIXER I PURCHASED WAS A DEFECT. I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE FOR MY OTHER DAUGHTER AND I WILL HAVE HER CHECK THAT OVER ALSO. I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS AND I WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER.
1,Always Needing Repairs!,I have had my mixer for 2 years and it has been nothing but trouble. The one year warranty didn't apply to my mixer that was leaking grease from the gears! Customer service said it was normal. I'll agree with the first writer that said the products have gone down hill since Whirlpool has taken over!!!! I would go with a Cuisanart.
2,I love regencies!,"I read Regency romances at a rate of about one every two days. I have a counselor for many years and find that they take me away from our often stressful world to a less complicated time. They are my Valium. They help me sleep.This book is out of the predictable style of many regencies. However,I agree with the other reviewer for different reasons. This book is full of meaningless conflict. Dillon, the spurned female lead character acts like someone much, much older than any 28 year old I've ever met. She acts like a 60 year old who hasn't worked at keeping herself open. She's had 10 years to get over being dumped by the hero and hasn't done the work. If you like conflict, nonsensical arguments, illogical interpersonal interactions, get this book. Otherwise, don't bother. The writing is good which is why I gave it two stars instead of one star. What a waste of time."
4,Scholarly and accessible,I found Professor Rabkin's book to be quite informative and a fascinating read. The book has a very scholarly tone but it is written so that even a layman can understand the complexities of international law. Rabkin does an excellent job of laying out the differing views of national sovereignty. He makes a compelling case for the value of retaining our independence through increasing globalization. The book is written pre-9/11 and does not reflect on the increasing debate over unilateral action in the war on terror. I would love to see Rabkin update the book to cover that.
3,"Excellent performance, Mediocre audio quality.","I loved the performance and always enjoy the artist however I was disappointed with the quality of the recording on this CD. Particularly The Secret Letter. There is a reoccurring noise in the audio on the CD which should only have a piano. Almost like a warp on a record. I had heard this on the mp3 versions of this recording. I heard this same effct on Lavendar Hills, too and thought it was a result of the lower quality of mp3. Although this is better on the CD, I was still disappointed to hear it on the CD version of The Secret Letter."
1,Never received book,"I never even received the book I bought, and no one notified my why, I am completely disappointed and frustrated."
5,The best effort so far from the Film Crew,"I like this episode better than ""Hollywood After Dark"" (which I gave 4 stars) and it really seems to fit the ol' MST3K groove. It is strange to hear the same late Mike era voices without the shadows of the bots and Mike. The commentary is as funny as ever from these guys. I look forward to more.Both the movie and Crew deliver with ample amounts of cheese--a Severe Hurt!"
2,VERY BORING MOVIE WITH FEW LAUGHS,"One of the worst jobs that Mike Nelson and Company have done so far. The movie I expect to be bad, but the commentary usually makes it watchable. Not so with this one. The laughs are few and far between. There just isn't much you can do with this movie. Save your money for a different one in this series such as the Giant of Marathon."
4,Fun movie,From the MST3k vets: a movie about highly incompetent aliens with bulging eyes trying to conquer the world with giant cockroaches and giant cockroach-burning rays. Starring Peter Graves in a forgettable role as a brainwashed scientist this film is made worth watching by the wisecracks of the Film Crew!
4,Fun Stuff,Not as good as then collections of shows with movies but still something to add to the mst3k collection for fans.
4,"Good, but not the Crew's best","Overall I was was a little underwhelmed by this Film Crew release. Maybe it's because I saw their Hollywood After Dark (which is 5-Star funny, by the way) just before watching this one, but I've seen Mike, Kevin, and Bill do better. However, after giving it another try (sometimes their stuff requires repeated viewing to fully appreciate), it wasn't all that bad. Still, me giving Killers four stars is a gift to them from a devoted Mistie."
2,I love mst3k but...,"Mst3k was a very funny show, I thought. And this... it had a few funny lines in it and the rest was just crude. I think if they cleaned up their act a little it would be a lot better."
3,Gosh darn't....I miss MST3K!,I've bought two so far of the Film Crew series and.. and well.. nuts. the insanity btw the stranded guy and the bots vs. the mad scientist below is truly lost. It's a more miss then hit for this. I will buy more since I'm dumb. You decide on your own if this ride suites you.
1,Nice until it broke,"I know you probably won't believe me, but my knife broke while I was slicing an apple in half - or trying to cut one in half anyway. It was the blade that broke in approximately half - widthwise. It made very little sense, as I didn't feel like I was putting excessive pressure on it and I wasn't bending the blade since it was in an apple at the time (it was a big apple so the blade didn't even stick out the other side). My sister also owns the same knife and it makes me nervous as I think they are likely quite dangerous and if they break under other circumstances they could cause some harm - might leave metal shards or have the broken part fly somewhere, like in someone's eye. Be warned. This product is not a quality product, especially not for this price."
4,Great track listing,"If you're just getting started with judas Priest this is a really good comprehensive track list of some GREAT songs of theirs. Once you get this, then you can branch out into their albums, but this will give you an idea as to their range, from classic rock to glam, to just straight up metal."
5,great,"This is a great album from Judas Priest. I down loaded it from Amazon it has good quality, if you like JP this album may be what your looking for."
5,Required for all Fans,"A Good Selection of Judas Priest's Hits, the seller did an excellent job delivering the product. Thank you"
4,Well Established CD,"Exellent sound quality, captures the true ""essence"" of Judas preist. A few songs on here that I could do without thus the reasoning for the 4 star rating, No offence to the diehard Priest fans out there. ROCK ON!"
4,Long Live the Priest,"While listening to this CD Im sent back almost 20 years to my teens Theres nothing like ""Judas Priest style heavy metal""! It ROCKS"
5,Buy the big black collecter box instead!,"Decieved by radio lemons such as ""Screaming for Vengence"", I was astounded by just how GREAT these guys are. They really have it all, and lots of it, for what fills up two discs. A genre unto themselves, a mandatory inclusion in a complete Classic Rock collection. It was the best time I'd had in a long time, but despite the 5-star rating, might I recommend you pick up that big black collector box instead?"
4,Another Excellent Compliation for JP,"If you're already a big Judas Priest fan, then you probably own their other greatest hits albums they've put out and the box set, so it's not really ""essential"" that you own this, but hey, it beats switching out 20 different cds constantly to hear all of these songs.CD 1 opens up with Judas Rising off of their latest (although sadly, not their best work) album ""Angel of Retribution"", and CD 2 ends with another cut from the album, Revolution, with 30 years of awesome music sandwiched in between (although I wonder why it's not in chronological order?).As I said before, chances are if you're a Judas Priest fan, you probably own most of their CDs already or even the other greatest hits, but if you're just hearing them for the first time, this is an awesome place to start, but check out all of their albums because there's so much music they've done that cant all be included on here that is definitely some of their best."
3,Judas Priest Re-Mastered?,"This was supposed to be the remastered version, but the audio quality is very poor. Not sure if I was sent the right version or not. Was shipped on time in great condition."
2,Boring is how I feel after reading this book.,This is one of most boring Regency Romance I had read so far because it is humorless and lack witty dialogues.
2,Not a true CD Audio or DVD Audio Disc,I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.However I wasn't pleased to find that the CD Audio side won't play in the car or on the computer as it's not recognized as a CD Audio disc (apparently not uncommon with Dual Discs) - just as frustrating is the lack of true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here. Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed. If you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered - then you'll need to be happy playing it on your DVD player only. Disappointing.
3,Australian SF Reader,"As far as girly horse books go, this is definitely one of them. However, the horses are the characters, in the Watership Down tradition.Like Kimba, the good white, well, silver in the case horse is a manly horse, and he leads his herd around and defends them from the horse supervillain, etc."
5,The Bomb CD,"This has to be the best CD that I have listened too in quite a while! Both my husband and I were taping our toes and snaping our fingers to the funky beats of Down to the Bone. I urge anyone who loves funky music to add this CD to their collection--believe me, you won't go wrong!"
5,a funky good time!,everybody go out and buy this and have a funky good time!one of the best jazzfunk groups today!i'm sure the godfather james brown would groove to this!take it to the bridge!j.h.
2,"Mike in Baltimore, MD","After absolutely loving ""From Manhattan to Staten,"" I was sorely disappointed with ""Album II."" While the new album has the same sound as ""FMTS"", with the exception of the title track the music just didn't grab me like FMTS did. Better luck next time!"
5,Urban Grooves,"DTTB has done it again! Urban Grooves is the best CD I've listen to in a looooong time.. call it Jazz/Funk, Acid Jazz whatever... Just call it the best damn Jazz sound out there! This band plays so 'tight' you just can't sit and listen.. you have to be up and movin' to their jams. Looking forward to DTTB tour in the USA the summer of 2000. See you in NYC DTTB!"
4,Continued,"This band is amazing and very original. The blaring guitars and incredibly catchy vocals make this one of my favorite new albums. It doesn't sound much like Failure (if you know the band) in the sense that it is much more upbeat, and less melancholy. But, like Failure, it has a futuristic-spaced out style to it. If there is any instance in which the bands show musical similarity, is if you compare some of Magnified's songs to ""pillowhead"" on Fantastic planet. But hey, this is a great cd, and something that should be in any rock fan's collection. And I should stop comparing it to other bands, because it is unlike almost anything on the radio today. Not that it is strange or anything, but instead the opposite. It is rock in its purest form, instead with added effects that make it seem futuristic."
5,Excellent Overview,"Since others have already published excellent reviews, let me simply add this.As one who has studied Scripture, the history of Christianity, textual criticism, and exegesis, this book's greatest assistance for me was in tying all of these topics together. Pelikan ties things together in such a way that the reader is able to see how worldview has impacted how one understands the Scriptures and how one understands the Scriptures has impacted world view.This book will especially be helpful for the average reader who has little understanding of how we got the Bible that we have today, but is also good for the advanced student because Pelikan weaves things together in such a wonderful way."
3,half and half,"This book started out well, but then ran into a contradiction.Although the Jews were the most literate ancient people, he insisted on their being not literate but a memorizing people for passing on traditions.This results in the gospels not being written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John but being handed down by word of mouth until finalized and written out much later.But at the same time and in the same place the epistles being written by the writer and spread in written form word for word.So on the gospels he is a liberal/modernist, but on the epistles he is fundamentalist.Sorry, but you just can't have it both ways."
4,A very good call for cooperation between religions,"The author wrote his book to show that God speaks to people of all faiths. The Bible, he writes does not belong to the Jews or to the Christians or to the Muslims alone; it belongs to all people. All people have the right to interpret the Bible as they want, as long they do no harm to others.And the religions need to work together. The Muslims taught the Jews and the Christians the philosophy of the Greeks by translating the ancient Greek philosophical works. The period of Enlightenment for Christianity and Judaism, the quest for a rational religion of nature, grew from the writings and teachings of other faiths. Judaism and Christianity contributed to the other and without the other neither would have advanced to the stage they are currently in."
2,The author should value the punctuation known as the period,"There too many interjections of all kinds.Each page is a mess of commas, dashes, parentheses, quotation marks, italics,semi-colons, and colons.The sentences are too long. Many are 9 lines long. The subjects of the sentences are usually near the end, which makes things worse.I bought this book because I was interested in the history of the Gospels.I wanted to learn about the who, what, where, when, why, and how of those books. This puffed-up pile of painful prose didn't tell me any of these things."
2,Questioning this Review,I am receiving a message stating DeltaView 3.0 this product is no longer for sale....this is a confusing message. Does this mean we are not going to get the product I've ordered? -C
5,Terrific backpack,"I bought this pack after my running backpack all but fell apart. The shoulder strap ripped apart during a flight. The zippers came apart. It was light and flimsy but expensive because it had the logo of a running shoe company on it. I use my backpacks for business travel on planes and driving, for personal trips like running events, kids events, etc. I wanted something comfortable but tough this time around. Right out of the box I realized I made the right decision. This bag is tough, has great storage, and is super comfortable."
3,Interesting books but somewhat partisan,"This is a most interesting book and covers a topic of some importance in Cuban history. It contains valuable information and definitely should be read by those interested in the topic. However, the reader should be aware that the author views US actions against Cuban bandits through somewhat partisan and left of center lenses. It lacks an update to present times. Supplementary information can be found.[...]"
3,Not as good as I remembered,"Well sung, and a couple of the songs are great, but I was taken to see a production as a child and it was not as good a show as I remembered."
1,Ray Stevens All Time Hits,I ordered this for one particular song (My dad). I didn't care for any of the rest of the selections.
3,"Three songs, with variations","I ordered this one after hearing one cut on the radio. I was ignorant (or had blissfully forgotten) of Ray StevensMost of the eleven ""hits"" were just re-working the same sound and idea. For me these were historical artifacts without even a mild hint of nostalgia. Ahab the Arab sounds painfully ignorant today."
4,Distinctive Historical Performance,"Scherchen was always a musician of character. His performance of the Brandenburgs is no exception. The slow movements are particularly slow, but also highly expressive.The musicians do not display the virtuosity in this music that is the norm today. There is some out of tune playing etc. But they give their all to Scherchen's distinctive vision.A must for those interested in the performance history of these pieces and for fans of this great conductor.Good stereo sound."
4,Best product I could find in our price range,"This is an OK product. It is a good size and is colorful and easy to read. I like having the month, days, seasons, and weather all on one big sheet so my son can see how everything works together.However, the magnets are very week, so if the calendar is bumped a little bit, it disarranges the number magnets.Also, it looked in the picture as if the calendar sets up like an easel but it isn't. Instead, I have a cheap metal picture frame stand to keep the calendar standing up on the desk for use every day.There are better products out there, but I just didn't think that more than $20 is appropriate for our situation."
2,Not too Thrilled,"This is a pretty cool item, however, the magnets are very weak and stuff is all over the place. Not a very practical item for parents who don't like millions of pieces of toys scattered throughout the house!"
2,Magnets aren't strong enough,"I noticed right away that some of the magnets wouldn't stick very well. Then after some use they wouldn't stick at all. Also, the numbers starting peeling off the magnets. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Cheaply made!,"I bought this magnetic calendar despite the negative reviews because it was recommended by the homeschool curriculum we are using (Moving Beyond the Page). I wish I had not purchased it. I just got around to opening it after having bought it a few months ago in preparation to home school and it is falling apart straight out of the package. The stickers that are attached to the magnets are peeling off. The magnets aren't very strong so they slip constantly. The overall size and feel of the calendar is dinky and cheap. Anyone else looking at this calendar because of recommendations from MBTP, don't do it! It isn't at all necessary to have this calendar to go along with the curriculum. Any calendar will do. We aren't even using this one."
1,Made out of thin cardboard,"I purchased this for my in home preschool. Upon opening it, the lower left corner was damaged and the packing box was not. So the seller shipped it damaged. The magnets do not stick well to whatever thin metal there is in the cardboard. It was a total waste of money and I returned it. Would not purchase again."
3,Just OK,"This is not for the child who likes to fiddle with toys a lot. My son has lost some of the pieces because they do not stick very well. Overall it did what I bought it to do, which was to teach him the months and days in a fun way that he can be involved with daily."
5,great learning calendar,"My 2 year old loved our advent calendar. After Christmas season ended, I wanted to find another calendar to use daily with him. He enjoys ""updating the calendar"" with my help. While the details are beyond his level, we do use this calendar each day to change the date and look at the weather. It also helps him get a basic sense of when people are visiting as I will point to the calendar to let him know when grandparents are coming etc. I hang this calendar on our pantry door and the magnets withstand the opening and closing of the pantry many times per day."
4,Delicious,"This will be the third time that I have ordered these delicious lollypops. I disagree with another poster in that I think they all taste remarkably like the flavors that they are supposed to. There are some unusual flavors like ""buttered popcorn"" and ""peanut butter,"" but surprisingly they are also awesome tasting. The only problem I had with these pops are that they do come in a plastic bag in a corregated cardboard box, but the last time I got them the box looked like an accordian. This is probably not the fault of the shipper, and I would have sent them back, but the lollypops were in good conditions with the exception of several bent sticks. These pops are hard to find in the stores and I am glad to be able to get them here."
2,Not worth the price,"Cheaply made. Some of the number segments are brighter than the others, making the display a bit annoying to look at. I threw in an extra star because it tells time and the night light is a nice feature."
5,chaney alarm clock,"This clock is perfect. The big digital letters glow in the dark.It has a night light to turn on with 2 different light adjustments.Easy directions for alarm and set-up. The alarm sound is not tooloud or shrill, just right. I am really happy to this clock and it isnot too small for a night stand."
5,Double Bladed Lightsaber = Double Bladed Fun,"The Star Wars Episode I Darth Maul Electronic double bladed lightsaber is a hit with my twelve year old and with us, his parents.This item was on his birthday wish list and I had no trouble saying ""yes"" as the price was fabulous--.... It was shipped right away.What you first notice is the lightsaber's size--it's over five feet and has double red blades, each measuring about 21 inches. When you turn it on to start battling, there's a cool sound that signals you're ready to battle. Once you hit your target the light sabers flash and the lightsaber seems to growl.This lightsaber is my son's first choice when he's battling with his friends. It uses two ""C"" batteries which seem to last a long time.Thumbs up from the parents. Cool toy. Cool price."
3,A two-edged laser sword,"The double-bladed lightsaber is an awesome sight, especially if you possess the dexterity to spin it ala Ray Park. Try to fight anyone with this, though, and you're in for disappointment. The blades are not lit the way they are on Hasbro's single-bladed sabers--a strobe flashes only on ridiuclously forceful contact. The power button is strategically located so that only those who don't have hands won't accidentally shut it off. Clearly, this is a weapon born of a Jedi conspiracy to disarm Sith Knights at critical moments. Buy it just to have it around, but don't expect to kill anyone with it like a proper Sith Lord should."
5,The greatest toy ever built even better then a BMW,This is the bessssssssstttttttttttttt ever toy i have everplayed with it is grrrrrrrreeeeeaaat I never had a better toy I couldnever find it any were so I had to pay [extra] for it. Take my advise even if it's made out of plastic it feels like the real thing. I like how it light up it amazing buy it. It's a great deal. END
4,Darth Maul Saber,"I love all kinds of lightsabers, especially the double-bladed one. I couldn't wait to buy the new one with the battery-guard! But frankly, I wasn't too impressed with what I got. The blades are way too short, and another REALLY annoying thing is the little buttons on it. You'd think if you had a double-bladed lightsaber, you should be able to spin it around like Maul does...not with those buttons constantly getting pressed. I finally just took them out. It's fairly durable though, but I would hesitate to recommend it."
2,Bad Buttons,The on/off buttons as well as the reset button are fully exposed on the handle of this toy making it impossible to use without accidentally turning it on and off all the time. I had to make some rubber guards to protect the buttons from being accidentally hit so the toy would stay on as long as it was being played with. My kids were completely disgusted with this toy until I fixed it. If you buy one be ready to fix it.
5,Awesome,"This toy is da bomb! If you get the Anakin Skywalker lightsaber, you can fight other people or friends. This toy will keep you busy for hours."
4,LISTEN UP ALL JEDI KNIGHTS!!!,"I was always amazed at the way the jedi fought in the movie. If you think the force is with you, get this toy. Its probablly the closest thing to an original lightsaber. But this toy has one problem, which is that the ON/OFF button is on the handle and gets pressed quite often when fighting. This toy is pretty durable, in my opinion, because while fighting I have hit objects pretty hard by mistake a few times but the lightsaber stays intact. Overall, this is a fun toy to play with and if you practice, you might fight like the jedi!"
2,CHOOSE SOMETHING ELSE,"You can't tell a book by its cover. The synopsis sounded good and the book started out in grand epic style by introducing a host of characters. The interest stopped there. The characters were undeveloped and the lapses in time were confusing. Dialogue was stilted and love scenes were sappy. There did not seem to be much craft used in developing the plot. It appeared that the author had done his historical research and then needed to share that learning through the dialogue of his characters. Writing in hindsight the author had material the characters would never have known. Nevertheless, the information was inelegantly expressed through the words of the speakers who sounded too prophetic and preachy to be real. I did learn something of the origins of the Marines but the price of the knowledge was too high. Don't bother."
1,I have lost hours of my life that I will never get back,"My partner brought me this to read while I was sick in bed. I thought, well, Leon Uris, this should be good.The writing was lousy. It was self-indulgent and preachy, but more to the point, it was just lousy. At times I skipped whole pages. And then there were the things we were asked to believe: not only historical inaccuracies, but Adonis-Zachary, the shining hero of the book, predicting the Japanese invasions that would occur half a century later. Or an entire church full of ex-slaves interrupting their service to gasp, ""Oh God! How beautiful he is!"" (I paraphrase).Many times I wondered if the author was in the last stages of alcoholism.Finally, the ending was not only unrealistic and poorly done, it was an abomination to the art of storytelling.I really do feel as though I have just wasted a part of my life by reading this book."
1,Sorry and illogical ending.,This book has one of the poorest endings I've ever read. It seems Uris didn't know what to do with it. The last two chapters made this book a flop!
2,Very disappointed,"This is a classic romance novel, not an adventure story as we might expect from Uris. While the story of the early days of the Marince Corps is interesting and very well researched, there is virtually no action. I strongly suspect, in spite of no official word from the Uris camp, that this book was finished by others. Re-read earlier works for your Uris fix and pass this one by."
1,a disappointment,"Don't bother buying this book unless you feel you must read Uris' last book. Surprised to see it on the half-price table, I bought it from curiosity and finished it out of loyalty, having read 'Battle Cry' in the '50s and almost all his subsequent books. This book has almost no military action, an almost melodramatic plot, and (worst of all for me) the dialog sounds like people speaking in modern times. Having served with the Marine Corps, I found some of the sentiments and attitudes hoaky and the romance between the two main characters (this being a clash of strong wills) was wooden. You'd do better with Ayn Rand. Shortly after starting the book, I noticed that Uris died this year; I'm betting his secretary and a sophomore American Lit major finished it for him. This is a sad way to cap a fine career, one that brought me enjoyment most of my adult life."
3,"""O'Hara's Choice""","My advise: read the whole book (it is pretty good), but skip the last chapter. Compose your own ending. Believe me, your ending will be a better ending than the one the author penned.Being a former Marine, I was satisfied with the treatment of the Marines, in general. The ending, however, was all wrong. It was as if Uris had died (which he did in 2003), and some anti-military feminist finished the last chapter for him.You've been warned."
2,It brought a tear to my eye...,"...when I stopped to think of the time I wasted reading this trash! O'Hara's Choice was worth exactly what I paid for it...thank God I got the book as a gift.I have to agree with ""a disappointment""'s review. I expected a better ending and it crossed my mind whether someone other than Uris had finished writing the book.It was a drippy romance followed by an unrealistic USMC twist topped off with a ridiculous ending."
2,Promising....Then Falls Flat,Having always heard great things about Uris's writing I was excited to read this work about the US Marine Corps. And while it started out well the book falls flat with sappy interludes and silly situations. I had hoped for a story of the United States after the Civil War though the development of the Corps. Unfortunately what I got was a implausible love story told in flowery overemotional language that more suited a Romance novel.I would definitely not recommend this book.
1,Farstone doesn't care about it's customers.,"I have read the previous review and I wanted to add to it. I have been using game drive for well over a year and I have come to love and hate it. It's great when it works but getting it to work can be really tricky and sometimes just impossible. I have been to Farstone's website and read through all of thier support documents but they are not very helpful. There are many many game titles that this software claims to support but does not. I also have never had any luck emulating a DVD. It will create the image and play it, but the picture is horrible. I wish I could recommend a better emulation software to people reading this review, but the only other software I know of is Alcohol but it is very tricky to use and has even less support than gamedrive."
3,has already broken 3 times (in 2 months),Good treadmill...at first. But it has already broken various times over the 2 month span since I bought it. Customer service is nice on the phone but prefers to send parts instead of coming to fix the item. Fingers crossed it keeps working! Wish I would have just spent more $$ for a better treadmill.
2,Look elsewhere,"This rest is not very comfortable, and it is difficult to determine if its on correctly or not. The concept is great, but the actual product leaves a lot to be desired."
4,Coloring Outside the Lines review,"Coloring Outside the Lines is a fun compilation of vignettes during an often misunderstand era of music and youth. It is great to follow the development of the author's growth and persepective as she lives through the adventures of punk rock that most consider legend. I recommend this for anyone who is interested in the culture, whether you were there or not."
4,Totally Cool Book!!,"I just finished this book and I thought it was great! I've read a bunch of punk books, but this one made me feel like I was really there. It's so cool that Amie got to go skating with Tony Alva and she and Maggie threw a dinner party for Black Flag.The pictures were great. The book was really funny, but kinda sad too. I'm lending it to all my friends!"
1,Don't Be fooled--no real Miller here!,"This cd is one of dozens recorded after the demise of the great Glenn Miller, strictly trying to cash in on the Miller name. The musicianship is poor. Like most cd rip-offs of this nature, the tunes are primarily those of no copyright restriction or ""public domain"" tunes as they are referred to; an obvious attempt to avoid paying royalties to the publishers or composers. Although included here are a few actual titles that Miller recorded, they are not played as Miller played them (different and inferior arrangements). Don't support this lackluster effort by purchasing this cd--purchase the original Miller recordings. Or if you do purchase this cd, you might find it comes in handy for a coffee table coaster!"
1,Pathetic,"While I enjoyed the first book, Passion, to say this book left me cold is an understatement. There was no way you could connect any kind of love between Matthew and Patience, is was just all sex scenes that were obviously written to try and shock the reader, which in truth left this reader cold and annoyed as we have all waited so long for this 2nd book. In the 1st book my heart went out to Matthew and the way he was treated and turned upon. And quite frankly I am angry at Valdez. The ending is thrown together so badly that you are left there thinking to yourself, ""Oh please"", and not in a good way. So all I can say to Ms. Valdez is, ""Poorly done, very poorly done."" For this avid Romance reader this book is in the trash, not even worth selling to a buy back book store, it needs to be put out of its misery."
3,"Okay...not good, not great.","Passion was my first historical romance book since I went back to my childhood passion of reading. It was erotic, romantic and touching at times and has led me on to bookcase full of other series and adventures. I had high expectation for Patience, the second book of the series(?). I thought is was just okay. It was a much angrier book then the first one. There was less connection between the characters and less actual sex. I got past the S&M in the book that I had expected based on other reviews. There just wasn't much more to the story. I typically re-read books that I really like, I can see this one gathering dust on the shelf until it is sold at a garage sale. I hope Lisa Valdez finds her spark again and writes a better story for Prudence."
2,Left me cold and disturbed.,"Ok, now I loved ""Passion"" so I am comfortable with Lisa Valdez's style of writing. And her erotic imagery. But this...just left me perplexed.The sex scene was jaw-droppingly strange. He didn't care about her ""distress"" even though she was a virgin. Her tears turned him on?and enough with the ""Yes, Matthew!"" She is not a dog! I mean, ""Stay, Patience""?? Really?There was no warmth, and BDSM goes both ways. She's not supposed to submissive ALL the time.And last, there would be a heated coversation, or a tender moment about love and suddenly the word c**k would be thrown around. I'm all for it in the right times, but sometimes it does not fit the moment!Meh."
1,Wrong Genre,This book needs to be under erotica. It is not a romance novel by any stretch of the imagination. This is porn plain and simple and should be catagorized as such. As I am not into bondage and S/M I did not bother to read past the first chapter. Books even on Amazon really cost too much to throw away without reading. Next time please let me know what I'm buying.
3,Ummm . . .,"I wanted to like this book so much, I am probably giving it more slack than it deserves (pun intended;). But the truth is, the BDSM factor in this story was just too over the top. Some of the stuff they did sounded just plain ridiculous, not to mention icky. And Matthew seemed like an entirely different person in this book than he did inPassion. I liked Valdez's first novel, and have been looking forward toPatience (Passion, Book 2), but I have to admit it was a serious let down. The reason I gave the book three stars is because, well, no matter the subject matter, Lisa Valdez knows how to keep readers turning the pages."
2,Unfortunately I just didn't care about the characters...,"I thought Passion was a 4 star book and the only reason I rated this 2 stars and not 1 is bc I did actually finish it. The problems were numerous. First problem was ultimately I just didn't care about the characters. The second problem was the spanking garbage. Pleeeease, enough with the spanking and her actually liking having a sore bottom. ugh The third problem was the long lectures he gave her on submission and finding out what she desired. They didn't even know one another and he just assumed she needed what he was going to give her. The fourth problem was there was no suspense or conflict to make me want to continue to turn the pages. I really didn't care if she played her cello and I didn't care if he lost his fortune. Overall not a good book I did finish however due to the writing style but I skipped over stuff towards the end. I just didn't care anymore and wanted it to be over!"
2,Disappointing,"I loved Passion. It was the first (actually - ONLY) romance novel that made me cry. The suspense was excruciating, the romance sweet, the sex quite sizzling.Waiting for Patience was painful!That said, I hated Patience. I just could not sympathize with the characters. I really thought I liked Mark in Passion, but Ms. Valdez didn't convince me to like him in Patience. There was not enough love in this book. The sex scenes were, well, boring. I am not interested in detailed descriptions of submission training.I did learn a new word. Who would of thought there was different terminology for two very similar acts?A note of interest: There is no teaser for a follow up novel. I was under the impression there would be four in a series. I do hope Ms. Valdez writes another, but only if it is the quality of Passion.I cannot recommend this book. I don't plan on selling Passion, but I'm taking Patience to the paperback exchange."
3,Not as good as Passion,"After such a LOOOOOONG wait, I expected a good if not great book but I was disappointed. Matt is nothing like the first book which is upsetting because I thought he could be a great hero and Patience is simply blah (with all her I love my teacher who didnt love me drama).... I wanted more of a good story (like Passion) but I didnt get it here...."
3,So Different from Passion!,"While Passion was a heartwrenching Regency era erotica novel, Patience should be classified as a Regency era BDSM novel. There was so much emotion in Passion that it actually made me tear up a little as it was so well written.In Patience, while still well written, there is a completely different flavor altogether. The world of BDSM is a hard one for people to understand and putting the label ""romance novel"" on this is stretching it a bit far. While there was a lot of emotion in the book, it was more a novel of a man wanting to dominate a woman and exploit her submissive nature.I still enjoyed the book but was a bit disappointed that it was so different from her first novel!"
3,Passion Vs Patience,"If I were to Score Passion 100 Degrees of HotnessI score Patience a balmy 80 degrees. Warmer than some, but still lacky real heat.I await Fitz Roy's story... a secondary character from Patience, the only male that caught my eye.Matthew Hawkmore wasn't a bore, but wasn't a man I could adore!"
2,"Passion was my favorite, Patience not so much","Honestly, Passion is the best romance novel I've ever come across. I love me a steamy sex scene, and plenty of them, but there has to be that romance element to them, which in Passion there was. But Patience was another story...The sex scene at least every other chapter is not ""hot"" to me. The scenes actually disturbed me. I'm sorry, but I really don't understand BDSM. And they don't even have actual intercourse until near the end of the book, and it was a lot of build up for nothing. For most of the ""sex scenes"" she's giving him a bl*w j*b or getting spanked.If you loved Passion you'll probably give Patience a chance like I did, despite the bad reviews you read on amazon.com, but you'll still probably come crawling back to write a bad review too.In all, it was just really disappointing after the masterpiece of Passion. I wanted to give it 1 star, but I just didn't have the heart to because I haven't given up on Lisa Valdez. Yet."
2,A Miss........,"While I thought PASSION was marvelous - I cannot say the same for PATIENCE - I read it to the bitter end, all the while feeling very uncomfortable. All that Dom/Sub seemed to come out of left field, almost as if there was a chapter or three missing. Valdez writes really well - but this one to me seemed like a car accident, how in the world did Matthew know Patience was a sub - where in the world was the story behind how he became a Dom - oh yeah a page or so about when he was 12. What about Matthew's former fiancée? Engaged for how long and he never? Notwithstanding that she alluded to ....something .......one huge hit with PASSION, and a very long time for a reader to wait for one very clear miss with PATIENCE"
2,if you like controlling men...,"I was so eager to get this book, having waited years and being a fan of Passion. I still haven't finished it and despite being 200 pages in, I just can't get over the whole controlling/misogynistic male lead of Matt and how happy Patience is to be controlled and told what to do. That's just not my idea of romance or escapist reading. I read romances to get away from the realities of everyday life and, yes, to get turned on. And this book does neither for me. I will admit that there are some hot and satisfying scenes, and I occasionally pick the book back up in hopes that Matt will change for the better (that and I want my money's worth!) All that changes though is Patience's realization that she wants to be told what to do and her willingness to be a lapdog to a man."
2,Hmmmmm...,"I don't know what to say. I was truly expecting more from Ms. Valdez. I LOVED her last novel ""Passion."" But this one was sort of a letdown. First of all, I am a huge fan of Erotica (paranormal and historical), this was very erotic, but missing something. Oh I know....it lack the passion and romance like the other book. Erotic is good, but balance it with romance and passion. I felt Patience gave in too easy to the BSM, and Matthew Morgan Hawkmore, I did not like him, he came across like a bully and spoiled brat! Yes, I get it; he went through a major personal ""trauma,"" but come on.......I don't know what else to say but Hmmmmm."
4,Well construct and easy to understand,The price of the book is cheap and it is great for beginners. Its content is interesting and easy to understand.
2,Not to sure about product discription,"If i recall when i acquired the product, i was very disappointed when i started going through this book. I remember reading through the description with knowledge of this book about steak descriptions of history and wit not. Did not give any information on steaks. BUT...this book is really neat on cooking information and great recipes. i would have gave this book a better review if i where indeed looking for a cookbook. But still giving it to a friend for a descent first meat cookbook."
2,Low Price - but also low quality,"This is a decent kit. Price is low, but unfortunately the quality is not too great especially when you compare to other kit makers such as Faller or Vollmer. Plastic coloring is not realistic, pieces don't always fit together or function well, and ""stained glass"" windows do not look good. Granted, you can't complain too much because of the cheap price, but I would likely not buy again."
2,Get the 5x if you really need the illumination,This magnifier is powerful but poorly made.The is significant distortion in the corners and along the edges leaving only the center of the lens useful and if the available light isn't enough you're out of luck. When what you're looking at is in focus the built-in light isn't shinning on it.I'd have returned it as useless except that there are times when the ambiant light is enough to use this magnifier without needing it's built-in light.As a reminder of how useless the built-in light was I took the magnifier apart and removed all the light's parts. I'll use them as spares for the 5x version which works well and it's light is properly aimed.
4,A bit too much power,"I bought this along with a 5 power Magna Lite unit. For my needs the 5 power one is superior with less distortion and a flatter field. If your specific needs are for the greater power then this unit may work for you, but you are definitely sacrificing optical quality for greater power. By the way, I bought both units from Maxi-Aids. They are terrific. I ordered them on 7/5 at 7:00 pm and received them on 7/8."
3,Good quality for the price.,"These are good quality, slightly different in design from the picture shown but it doesn't affect performance. The machining is what I expected for what I paid, it could be better. It doesn't perform the task I had in mind very well, which is cutting 1/8 steel cotter pins on aircraft, but that is asking a lot. For infrequent usage it's a good buy, but look elsewhere for frequent usage."
3,This puzzle fits too well,"While the book is fairly enjoyable and a quick read, I found the characters to be, for the most part, two dimensional, and the dialogue to be stilted (perhaps due something to the translation). Also, too many disparate things occur that fit together in the end. However, it is interesting to read about police work and the legal system in a different country (Sweden) and how in what ways it is similar to (and different from) the U.S. One minor quibble which I often find in these kind of books is that one would think that where the evidence strongly suggests a far-reaching world-wide conspiracy, the main character would ""call in the cavalry"" much sooner."
4,So far ahead of the pack,"Every one of the Wallander series is so much better written than almost anything else in the genre, and this despite some awkward translating. Forgetting particulars of which is somewhat better than another, simply bear in mind that they are intelligent, credible, literate and complex. There are no ""babe"" detectives tearing off their badges to sleep with partners; no sex addicts, no gratuitous titillating crap of any sort--just detectives doing their work.My heart leaps for joy when I see a new one, and I've pre-ordered the upcoming Lina Wallander story. The Patricia Cornwall stories are an embarrasssment by comparison. It makes you wish you were a Swede."
2,Lousy translation,"Although I have read and enjoyed other Mankell books, I was unable to finish this one. The translator, Segerberg, seems to be incapable of constructing a complex sentence. One simple sentence after another makes reading this book a boring chore. There's no flow. The poor writing skills of this translator is so distracting that I lost all interest in the plot. I will, in the future, avoid any of Mankell's books that have been translated by Segerberg."
4,Typical Mankell,Fascinating plots and characters as is the case with all his books. Always a battle to put it down. Kurt Wallander a human being like you and me and not some super hero. Very enjoyable.
4,A Problem of Scale,"Henning Mankell is one the finest mystery writers in the world. He understands plotting, the building of tension and the pacing of a story. In terms of craft, he is right up there with P.D. James. Mankell's talent as an author explains why a series of books about a gloomy, middle aged detective from a small town in Sweden has developed an international following.The one problem with such a strong writing talent is that it sometimes allows an author to camoflouge a weak and unbelievable plot line. Kurt Wallander is a detective in small town Sweden and yet he stumbles onto a conspiracy with world wide implications. The scale of this conspiracy is far too great for Wallander's provincial world. For this novel to work, it requires more than virtuoso writing. The scale of the crime must fit in the scale of the hero's world. This is a very well written crime novel but in the end, I found it unbelievable."
1,Too many loose ends in the end!,"When I read a thriller or crime story I do not expect much, but I do expect that the mysteries are unveiled, the riddles solved and everything makes some kind of sense in the end. Unfortunately this expectation remains unsatisfied by this book. The last chapter (40) is basically a record of all those questions that remain unanswered for eternity. It is fair to say that I feel cheated somehow, because all those parts were used throughout the book to keep my attention and were used to generate the thrill and suspense in the first place. Rarely felt so disappointed! (The story itself was not bad until chapter 40...)"
4,Excellent Condition,The book is in great condition and arrived very quickly. My child no longer has to carry all her textboooks back and forth to school
3,It's a school book.,What else do you expect from a school book?Teach English 10 with it.Interesting story's.
1,Not a good iPad selection,The pages of this book take up less than half the screen. I'm sure it won't hold my granddaughters attention. A disappointing purchase.
5,The type of book I hope to write someday!,"This book has all of the critical elements necessary for a great children's book! The illustrations are engaging, etc. I just know my first grandson will enjoy this as part of his Valentine's Day gift. Thanks!"
5,Its A great album one of my favorites by Hank Jr,...Hank Williams Jr is a legend and the song ...called Standing in the Shadows [is] a good song. ... Hank Williams Sr would be proud of his son. You will get your money's worth when you buy this cd its when Jr was young before the beard and before he fell off a 500ft cliff. again this is a great cd. ...
1,It is a screen saver...,"This is not a documentary or anything like what is described below. It is a music CD with jellies on a complete dark, black background. There is no exploration of the beauty of life and the sea as described in the product description, nothing at all except black background. The description is designed to confuse the consumer in order to sell the product. If you like to have a Jellies screen saver then that is what you will get, not a documentary."
1,Brilliant book; horrible edition,"I first read Less Than Words Can Say in college, as a photocopied handout, and it changed the way I think about writing and language. It’s brilliant. I’m now an editor, and I wanted to buy a copy for a colleague, so I foolishly ignored the reviews here panning this edition of the book, and ordered it anyway. I ended up packing it up and sending it right back. I’m honestly not a typography snob, but in this case the typography is so bad it distracts you from the text. They used single quotes (`` and '') instead of real quotation marks, and dashes instead of hyphens (“young lady straying dryad—fashion through the surviving oaks”), so you can’t tell whether you’re reading a hyphenated word or two separate clauses. I’d rather read the online version at sourcetext.com, or even a photocopy of my old photocopy."
5,Excellent quality - compliment to the nail set,Good to have both the Nail and Lily set. It's constructed with nice strong materials which I thought for the price was a nice surprise. I purchased the books for instructions on how to make many styles with this tool.
1,Haven't I heard this before?,"Very low on originality. Bullets and Octane sound like a hybrid of the worst elements of Godsmack, Buckcherry and Warrant combined. While the playing is very tight, the music is lackluster and the lyrics are uninspiring. The band overcompensates for its lack of content with energy, but manages to fall short most of the time. If you are into this style of music I would recommend picking up a Buckcherry, Godsmack, or Tool CD instead."
1,Stolen Music,This albums music was stolen by B and O and their management. It was almost entirely writen by Skye Jayne the formor guitarist but both Skye Jayne and Jack Tankersly were fired with no warning prior to the release with no credits givin on the album.
2,"Major dissapointment after ""The Lord Won't Mind""","After reading the first book of the Peter and Charlie trilogy I thought - finally a book about a gay long term relationship. However, One for the Gods is a major dissapointment in two areas. One - the sexuality of Peter and Charlie - are they gay or just confused? Two - Why must they be unfaithful to each other. Can't there be a book about a gay long term relationship where the couple is faithful and happy with each other?"
5,Yes!,Back in print after years of being unavailable to generations of Merrick fans comes the follow-up to the national best-seller The Lord Won't Mind. The saga concludes with Forth Into Light.
4,Pure realism,"This is realistic fiction in the purest of forms. The story follows three friends all trying to figure out something: love, sexuality, identity, commitment, friendship, their future... This is as teenagery as you can get. I really enjoyed how the narrative switches between point of views so you can see how each is dealing (though I wish the switches were marked better... Sometimes it was hard to figure out for a second). I also wish that more of Avery's POV had been included because she did a couple things that I still don't understand (though teenagers tend to do things that no one, even themselves, understand)."
4,Yummy snacks,"My 15-month-old loves the Applesauce-Raisin Muffins, and they were even a hit with my husband! I have several more on my list to try in the coming weeks.The only thing I don't like is that several recipes (frozen desserts, shakes/smoothies) use raw eggs, which is generally considered a no-no these days (at least without a warning in the recipe about the risk - however low it may be - of salmonella poisoning). I may try these recipes using pasteurized egg-substitute in some cases, but the book should probably be revised to say something about that.Besides that one complaint, I'm very pleased with this cookbook and looking forward to making more healthy snacks for my son!"
1,Disappointing,"As a mom committed to a low/no sugar way of life for my family, I was excited to try the recipes in this book. For the most part, I was largely disappointed. The textures were strange and the food was quite bland. I would not recommend this book."
1,"Fruit Concentrate, Still Sugar!","I was really dissapointed with this book. I own hundreds of cookbooks and have never actually hated one until now. First, the majority of these recipes are made with fruit concentrate. In my book, that is still sugar, just under a different name. Fruit concentrate isn't even good for you. In the process of concetrating this fruit they strip it of everything before adding things back, so it is quite processed, even though it says 100% juice. Also, fruit concentrate still has all the same effects on your body that sugar does. I prefer using Agave Nectar in recipes for a sweetner if I have to use one because it doesn't give my 2 year old a sugar rush. I wasn't impressed with this book at all, don't recommend it, and am just sorry I bought it."
4,The most intelligent book I've read on the Future,"This is a real dark horse of a book. It seemed kind of slim and I wasn't expecting much, but, wow! Not only is it extremely well-researched, but it's beautifully written, and has real wisdom. I can't agree with the reviewer who criticized it as rambling. On the contrary, it's taut and focused, quite brilliant at times, especially (and I also disagree with the previous critic here) when Margolis deals with environmental matters. I work in this field, and I think Margolis's is one of the fairest, most balanced and wisest assessments I've come across. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a serious book about the future that's not a geeky bore."
3,More For Larger Scale Upgrades,"I purchased this book with the hope of finding a few capes similar in layout to mine, and with ideas on how people have renovated certain rooms or how they may use them differently than me. This book, while very nice, pretty much made me depressed - almost all of the renovations were too large scale for what I was looking to do and seems to focus more on dramatic upgrades such as whole additions, entire floor plan changes, and overall high-budget changes. If you are seeking design ideas for larger-scale cape upgrades, then this book would no doubt be a great resource, but if you are seeking smaller scale ideas for how others have redesigned certain cape-sized rooms, you may want to look elsewhere."
5,Great Book for Cape Owners,"This is a great book for owners of Cape homes looking for ideas on updates. The text explains in layman's terms what makes a house a ""Cape"" and the essential architectural elements to consider when making changes. The photos and text cover a couple of dozen Cape homes that have been updated. The possibilities for renovations are endless, yet the book presents these in a manner that allows the reader to visualize projects ranging from small to large. Both indoor and outdoor updates are addressed. While not an architectural guide, this book is a good starting point for a Cape owner with expansion or renovation plans in mind."
3,where is middle america?,"If my cape was on the ocean this would be a good source of ideas. However, it offers little for the typical solid, somewhat plain capes that populate middle America. I love mine and could use some practical advice - this book doesn't help much."
3,Results vary...,"Results of this product vary depending on how severe your condition is. If you are really constipated, prepared to be in pain with cramping. I took this product when I was experiencing bloating and the full feeling and the next morning I was miserable. I kept feeling like I was going to faint and I had moderate pain and cramping in my gut. It relieved the constipation, but at what price? Other times, I have taken it and only experienced runny stools, but anytime you take it, it does cause cramping. I prefer milk of magnesia instead."
3,"Dulcolax Stool Softener ""WARNING!!""",BE CAREFUL WITH THIS STUFF...Please fully read the FULL directions and FULL precautions... I didn't and I ended up in the worst pain of my life! My husband had me drink a pretty large amount of water. My stomach felt like it was on fire on the inside. I had AWFUL cramping. The water helped alot. Please be careful with this stuff!I gave it three stars to be neutral because i know it was my fault i didn't take it correctly. I ate one (1) single pill with a bowl of raisin brand and did not drink water right after taking the pill... worst night of my life.
2,Everyone different!,"I used the generic CVS brand the first time with absolutely no problems. Purchased Dulcolax and had the same intense pain as earlier reviewers. I thought I was going to faint the first time and had cold sweats. I attributed the pain to possibility of food poisoning as we had been out for dinner that evening. Took the pill a second time and pain not as intense but severe cramps. Definitely not a mild laxative. I tried one more time, took it last night, had same severe cramps at 3 in the morning and still have ""runs"" to the bathroom and it is 11 am.Everyone is different and I believe the reviewer that recommended taking it early in the day as a trial has a valid point. It is an effective laxative for some but for others it is to be avoided."
2,Not gentle and not overnight,"I was looking for a mild stool softener to help me through my high protein diet. Hhmm, however decided to write on the label that it's gentle and ""predictable"" should take a few pills himself. I was on the toilet for an hour just 2 hours after taking this, and a full day later, and I am not venturing far from home. I have been cramping and miserable for about 24 hours now."
3,Could be better...,"Some of my meds cause constipation...I've been taking these every day (2 per day). They help a little, but I'm searching for something better. Trying the Pearl Probiotics, so I can replace these."
1,The worse pain of my life,"I've had 4 wisdom teeth removed, gave birth to three children, had two fillings and one root canal. The pain I experienced from this product beat all of the above by a long shot. It works, but if you're on death's door does it really matter? Stay away!!!!"
3,its alright but its not real roots that is,First let me say i m somewhat of a new roots fan the 1st disc i got was the 02 offering but since then i ve seen em twice and coped afew more of ther older works but this was the 1st fresh roots disc i got and was let down badly black's flows ok but but the bands seems flate and anybody seen questlove cause he's missing here iknow evey roots cd is defferent but this one is but not in a good sense its a bit of a step down but a three star roots cd still better then 90% of what passes for hip hop.P.S. they are touring go see them i am
3,average,"This CD was just anthoer release from the Roots I not a huge dissapointment but just average...if they want to make this kind of record they have to step up the production, it was a bit lazy..lead single is dope but the albums best cut is the one with black thought doing his kane and kool g. rap impression...that was fire baby. PEACE"
1,It's Tired. The Roots are Tired. They need a new formula.,"I started out with The Roots nine years ago with the ""Do You Want More Album"" which I believe along with Iladelph Halflife is their best work. Since Iladelph, I believe The Roots desire for both commerical and monetary success has corrupted the roughness and the realness displayed in the two prior mentioned albums. I thought Phrenology was garbage. There was only one track that I liked. I give The Roots the benefit of the doubt and bought this album despite being unimpressed with the tracks that I heard on Windows Media player because I wanted to believe that The Roots still have it. Unfortunately, they don't. This is probably my last album purchase from this group because I believe that since Iladelph, The Roots are not only different they have completely changed their formula. There is a lot of garbage on the radio waves and a lot of mediocrity in the racks of record stores and you can add this album to that mediocre record rack."
2,DOES THIS HELP?,"Dance to it: 5Weirdness: 3Catchiness: 3Originality: 2Abrasiveness: 1Self Indulgence: 10Experimentation: 1Desperation: 10Believability: 2Darkness: 2Hardcore-ness: 1Cover Art: 5Genre Purity: 5Offensiveness: 4Accessibility: 6Notes: arguably ranking among their less dynamic material partly due to the absence of Rahzel, or Scratch, and the guitarist's ever-widening role"
5,Dont Sleep On This Album!!!!!,"It took 4 years but I finally gave this album a listen with unbiased ears after pre-judging it, I was surprised to realize this is some of the Roots best music. After Things Fall Apart, I wrote off Phrenology, Tipping Point, and Game Theory...come to find out all 3 albums are great.The music on here is some of the Roots most soulful, groove based music. Its not an attempt at pop as the Amazon editor suggests, it's just more easier to digest on the surface because of the melodies and grooves but the depth is still there. It's a short and sweet album that feels like a complete thought by the end of it. Every track is meaningful. It sucks I waited this long but better late than never...plus Dave Chapelle is on one of the bonus tracks, good stuff!"
3,Its okay...,"This is a pretty good album with the exception of the number of tracks. My best advice would be not to go into this album with extremely high expectations, and you won't be disappointed. Some of the stand-out tracks are Star ( my fav track ), Stay Cool, and Why. Not their best work by any means, but an album worth buying. This coming from a true Roots fan....peace"
4,Crazy Rhymes and Live Beats,"I neva really listened to The Roots that much. Then my homeboy told me I should listen to it. I thought it was pretty tight. Black Thought can rhyme like crazy and the live beats is good. This is another one of them rap groups that's different. I'm starting to get sick of the same old beats and rhymes about ice and cars and money. That's why I like Kanye West and Common and rappers like that. Don't get me wrong, I still listen to my G-Unit and all that, but occasionally I like to here sumthin a little different. This album gets 4 stars for rhymes and good original beats. The two beats that Scott Storch produced was off the chain. I will definately be looking forward to some more music by The Roots in the future."
4,Solid but not classic,Being a young hip-hop fan I am not familar with the majority of The Roots earlier works so in my perspective is not comparing this to other records but instead judging it purely based on what is heard. This is definetely a decent record. The production is bass driven and laid back and lyrically it sounds pretty raw to me. If I were to point out any weak points on the album I would say that The Roots struggle to be able to put together an adequate hook (with the exception of 'Somebody's Gotta Do It'). Also the beat backing 'Boom!' is downright lackluster and really does not tempt you to listen even though Black Thought drops some gems. I would definetely recommend this record to anyone who is strictly about beats and lyrics like me. Certainly enjoyable and one of the top five hip-hop albums of 2004.
4,It's Like Water-A Neccessity to Have,"I have followed these cats since Organix and their Imported EP, From the Ground Up. The Tipping Point...Hmmm, Man, Damn. This album definitely reflects the essence of all six albums. However, I do miss the substance of Malik B., Ursula Rucker, hell even, Dice Raw and Rahzel. As a true fan, I find this album like aged refined wine-worth indulgence and mental consumption. Nonetheless, I give em 4.5 stars. Damn, I can't do anything but only imagine what their Box Set would sound like-and that's real.Star/Pointro-10/10I Don't Care-8/10Don't Say Nuthin'-10/10Guns are Drawn-8.5/10Stay Cool-8/10Web-10/10Boom-9/10Somebody's Gotta Do It- 7/10Duck Down-8/10Why (What's Goin On?)- I feel the message, but as Cube says,"" Straight R&B, Straight R&B.- Could have been presented much better. 7/10(Sorry)"
4,Buy The Tipping Point now!!,"If you love The Roots, you will definitely become attached to this album. The lyrical genious is just as strong as other albums, but- like always- the beats and thoughts are so different they add a new funk to hip hop. Once I heard the new singles Stay Cool and Don't Say Nuthin I wasn't satisfied til I heard the whole album. This CD is bumpin in my house, computer, and car...I can't get enough of it! You have to buy The Tipping Point if you are a true Roots fan, and if you're not a die hard fan it's one of those essential CD's to any hip hop collection."
5,"This CD is very, very cool. If you're a fan, just get it.","Listen, I've always been irritated by Amazon customer reviews that basically say, ""Hey, this isn't what I want [insert artist] to do! I want another [insert earlier recording by this artist]!"" Reading this sentiment over and over in reviews of this album has been particularly annoying. The Roots are great, and this is an great CD. That's it. Nothing whack here. Great rhymes. Great beats. Great lyrics. Great production.Arguably every release by every artist has some tracks that are stronger than others, and the Tipping Point is no exception in this regard. Still, overall, it's a very strong release from one of the greatest hip hop acts of all time. In my opinion, the negative reviews here do not seem to address the quality of this recording on its own merit, and that's a shame."
4,The Tipping Point,"I like the Roots, especially their third album ""Illadelph Halflife"", since the lyrics on this album were harder and production was totally different than on other roots albums. ""The Tipping Point"" is a flawless and well rounded cd as well. It kicks off with the classic ""Star"" and continues its high quality until the end. Best tracks besides ""Star"" are ""Guns are Drawn"" and ""Why (What's Goin' On?)"". The only thing I don't like about this cd are are the rather annoying hidden tracks (which leave a bad taste after finishing the album). Also, the ""hook-free"" web (which has A+ lyrics) can get a bit annoying after a while... still, this album is great (ranked about 3rd in the roots' discography), so feel free to purchase, no regrets."
4,4.5 stars,hott album. If you're a Roots fan then this is a must buy. Black Thought stays on point. No disappointments.
3,its ok. barely worth the $1.26 i paid on allofmp3,"except for ""dont say nothin"" there are no other stand out tracks. the album is okay overall but nothing memorable or exciting or something to talk about. just get that song and you'll be satisfied, unless u are a roots fan"
3,Good but not Great!,"The cd Is good but there Is a lot missing.Sampling has seemed to replace the band mostly, and It Is not as exploritory as previous roots works.I hope that the roots get back to what they do best on their next outing."
2,Hit&Miss,"The Roots are truly a frustrating Band on so many levels. on One there attitude is do as they please,but on the Other as Industry Vets you still wonder what is gonna happen if they ever get it all together at once. they can't seem to get Words&Music together. this Set like alot of there previous work has some instrumental work&Grooves but the Production&Overall vibe falls off after starting off strong. you expect more from them by now&you feel they are missing something&can't quite get it all together as one."
3,they jamb,roots jamb but check out afroman and his doubleneck guitar and the 2 zigzags and mr. mixx. afroholic even better times. join the streetteam.fro
4,Coming Back With More Hits,"This CD is really tight! While it is not as creative as Phernology, it holdS its own for what it was trying to achieve lyrically. Black Thought came off with his lyrical gymnastics especially on Star and Stay Cool, which happens to be my favorite tracks. The only requirement for this album is you must be a die-hard member of the Roots crew! The length of the album did not bother me too much because all the tracks are tight with the exception of Duck Down which is OK. Do You Want More??????!!!!!"
3,Over Produced,"Let me start by saying I love The Roots. So maybe my disappointment is based in the fact I keep wanting them to take their music to the next level on each disc. I didn't feel they really went there on TTP. This album is alot more ""polished"" than their previous efforts, complete with samples and handclaps. I was hoping that the talent that made them not only the best live show in hip-hop, but also one of the best live acts in music would continue to be showcased. I just didn't feel it was. The song they included on their Okayplayer compilation ""Y'all Know Who"" is straight fire and would have been a welcome addition to TTP. But always realize an average effort from the Roots still puts them at the top of the hip hop genre."
1,What The Hell...,"Two out of ten songs were actually good. This is a poorly done album. It was too short. The Roots were too lazy. This is mostly garbage. I wasn't feelings the beats, lyrics are tight though, Black Thought is one of the best lyricist of all time, but the songs won't be good with poor production.2/10 = 1/5"
2,WTF,"What is this. C'mon. Lousy, meaningless tracks. Theres only 12 is mos def not worth buyingat all."
3,okay,"a few months ago, the roots relesed a 10 track album called the tipping point. so i heard it was good and downloaded it and burned it. after listening to it a few times i noticed that i was listening to the same songs every time. so, i threw it on my desk and only listened to the good songs when i could. now, the good songs arent just good. THey're AMAZINg. they have so much skill. but, the not so good songs are just plain boring or not worth listening to. so i suggest you download these songs:""STAR""- THE MAJOR HIGH PINT ON THE ALBUM. YOU LOVE IT OR HATE IT BUT 90% OF THE PEOPLE THAT LISTEN TO IT WILL LOVE IT.""DON'T SAY NUTHIN'""- FIRST SINGLE AND GREAT SONG. NOT AS GOOD AS STAR BUT STILL AMAZING.""WHY (WHATS GOIN' ON)""- HAVENT LISTENED TO IT THAT MUCH BUT STILL PRETTY GOOD.ALL THE REST ARE OKAY OR JUST PLAIN TERRIBLEI THINK THE ROOTS CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS."
4,great album,"I've been listening to this cd for the past couple weeks and I can't understand why anyone would rate this cd anything less than 4 stars. I listen to underground hip hop because it's original. This cd is everything a true hip hop fan loves. The beats are simple and real catchy. The song with devin the dude is amazing. Some cd's have to grow on you before you give them a thumbs up, I loved this one the first time I heard it."
3,Good but outdated,Not much to say...this was written in the 90's and that world barely exists anymore. Nonetheless the info is valuable and many of the old tricks of the trade are still being foisted on unsuspecting musicians...worth reading but there must be something more up-to-date
3,Confessions of a Record Producer,"This book provides some useful information, but contains quite a few errors. It seems Mr. Avalon (who for some unexplained reason is apparently afraid to use his real name) has a bone to pick with the music industry. Maybe he's one of those guys who just couldn't make it and is resentful. For a more accurate take on the music biz, check out Don Passman's ""All You Need To Know About The Music Business"" and ""The Musicians Business and Legal Guide (by various authors). Also, there's a really good, easy to understand book on copyright law called ""Music Copyright For The New Millennium"" which is worth a read as well."
4,Excellent source of info that very few ever speak about,"If you are considering entering the music industry or are in it, but would like to know the real deal on how things work, this book is an excellent source of information. The information is a very straight forward account of the good and not so good practises of the industry."
5,Will make you less of a sucker,A very good book with excellent information to avoid getting caught in scams. And fun to read. Will successfully destroy all your ideals about this business.
5,Outstanding,"If you any interested in self preservation in the music industry, then this book is a must! So far, I haven't read a book that breaks down the crude realities of the music industry, like he has."
4,Inside look,A hands-on experience is always better than a theory and this book presents a hands-on experience of one of the people that escaped the jungle of music and lived to tell the tale. This rogue businessman has his eyes set on novices; more exactly he wants people to know the secrets of the trade he's betrayed. Inside information never heard before is what lurks between the covers of this book. With an easy structure and accessible style Moses Avalon's book is a revelation in which facts talk and theory has been all but eliminated
4,great deal,its much cheaper than bookstore. Thanks.its much cheaper than bookstore. Thanks.its much cheaper than bookstore. Thanks.its much cheaper than bookstore. Thanks.
2,Buy it only if you have to,"What can I say? It was the required text for my daughter's art class for school. She is not into art (the class is required for El. Ed. majors) so already she wasn't thrilled with it. On top of it is very technical. Perhaps a great book for an art lover, but very daunting for the non-artist who must use the book."
4,Design and History,"Popular with the Art Classes on college campuses nationwide, this book meets all expectations for an introductory art class. Covering Black and White design and history, the book covers styles and jargon used to describe the popular works. The Colour section does equally well, with vivid pictures of art work. Each era is discussed and the fundamentals of colour are provided. This is the book to get to get your feet wet in the world of Art."
1,Real Estate Hype by a third generation millionaire,This book didn't live up to its reviews. It just restates things I already know. There was nothing new to learn and very little about getting in the Student Housing Market. I don't need a book to get growth statistics on student populations.The author is a wealthy investor. So was his father and grandfather. Third generation wealth. He can't tell you how to get wealthy from personal experience. All the book talks about is how rich he is and how rich his partners are.I'm very disappointed and requested a refund.
4,I am a Sugar Artist,"I love this book for the wonderful information, the photos are not very clear but that is because it is an old book but I love the skill of piping and this is a good book for beginners.The Lambeth Method is tops but you can see where the Wilton's got their inspiration."
5,Great for 4th of july,This album is great for kids who like Mickey Mouse. The allegience to the US is really emphasized and it is just great to have so many songs about it.The voices used make the songs interesting for kids. Everyone will enjoy such an album.
4,Excellent,"I found this story by Mercedes Lackey gripping and fun to read. All of the characters are likeable, though Firesong was pretty annoying at times. I loved it."
2,That's it???,"After reading trilogies such as the Mage Winds and the Last Herald Mage, this latest one sunk. The characters are too familiar, and the action is almost predictable. There is a moral lesson for those involved such as Firesong and Karal, but the ending stunk. I've read better Lackey novels then this."
2,i'm sorry to say i found it boring.,Yes i did say boring. I say this for one reason only; i've read the other books. Compared to the other books this one is really slow and i found myself just wishing the book was over. But all in all it is a very well written book.
3,A Serious Letdown,"I'm sorry to say I have to agree with those reviewers who didn't like this book. I'm a fan of Valdemar and especially the ""Arrows"" Trilogy and ""By the Sword,"" but this book was a disappointment. I was bored by the effort of trying to keep track of (and care about) a dozen or more ""main"" characters, and I found much of the plot to be predictable and lacking suspense. Sadly, it's a letdown, given how much I enjoyed some of the other books in this series."
3,Mercedes has written better,"I loved the winds, magic, and arrows trilogys, but I was very dissaponted by this one. Karal was not a very interesting character and niether was An'desha. The only part of this book I really enjoyed was the parts about Darkwind, Elspeth and Treman. Treman was a great character and the book would have been better if it was all about him. The romance between Karal and Naomi was silly. They were so shy around each other and it was very boring. This trilogy probably could have been condenced into one book and been much better."
2,I definately did not think this was worth it,"WO!!! How did she manage to ruin the characters from previous books? I thought that this would be another thrilling book like the rest of her books, but I was shocked at the fact that I did not enjoy this series.Darkwind and Elspeth, for example, were completely different, as were many of her other previously enjoyed characters. I also didn't like the characters. They were flawless and totally unrelatable. So overall, Iwas utterly dissappointed at this particular series. Read the other series' before this one. It doesn't get good untill the very end."
2,could have been better? Damn straight.,"I just had to throw my two cents in when I saw this book had four stars. I got it when it first came out in hard cover, because I couldn't stand the wait. Absolute waste of money and time. The whole storm series was not very good, but this one did it. This one stopped me buying her books."
5,"An Excellent Read! Developed plot, Great Storyline","I loved this book. Many people said there were too many characters and plots that didn't tie in together. Were they reading the same book? Every single part of this story, the history of the first cataclism, to the tower, Grand Duke/King Tremane's ascension to the Hardornean throne which brings Iftel into the open and gives our heroes ideas of how to protect the land, even the Emperor of the East and his plot to destroy everything plays a part. I don't want to give it away but if you know the books...this one ties it all together!! We find out history and learn the why's of things. Without all the plotlines and character development we wouldn't understand how our heroes succeed at their near impossible task! Loved it!"
3,Storm breaking,"I have to say that this trilogy is one of my favorites, however I am truly dissapointed by the number of typos in the kindle edition. I don't mind the illustrations being so blurry although I am a great admirer of Larry Dixon's drawings but there was a sentence that ended with suck instead of such that truly changed the meaning of the text. Since I had read the book before I was able to figure out what everything meant but newcomers may have a more troublesome time and we shouldn't have to! Kindle users are paying just as much for the book and it should be properly edited! Please forgive my own typos as I am not an editor or a writer and am a very poor typist, however I am not being paid to do this."
3,Not as good as the first in the series.,"I am a Misty Lackey fan and have been since the first book came out back in the day. I have to say, though, I liked the first book in this series, the second was passable, but slogging through the third is quite tedious. Somehow the characters aren't engaging me like in the first two. The third book seems overly concerned with the political structure and court manipulations of all the factions involved. Firesong's eternal griping about having to do dishes and cooking makes me want to bi#ch slap him. All the characters have lost their luster. I think some people will like this book because of all the intricacies but a lot of us looking for character development won't care for it."
5,The Mage Storms,"Three books that are total adventure, not just for young adults.The stories are rich, full of color with wonderfuly well formed charactersso well developed that you can live the story with them as if you were in their shoes.I can only think of The Mages Storms as one book however all three are great in themselves, very enjoyable adventure.Excellent author."
3,"Satisfying, but tedious at times","I became a Lackey fan with Magic's Pawn, and have just finished my 18th Valdemar novel. When it was all over I was feeling satisfied, a little sad, and hopeful--that Karal's story would continue. I found the resolution of the storms ultimately satisfying, as well as Tremane's transformation. The passages--the REALLY LONG passages--detailing Imperial politics and Melles' intricate plotting were so tedious; I was tempted to skip past them. However, you know in a Lackey novel, you really can't skip it, no matter how painful the going is, because it might be important later. Great read for a fan, but she's not going to win any converts with this one"
4,Not a winner but very good nevertheless.,"Like all her books about Valdemar this one held my interest as Ms. Lackey developed the story by going back and forth between the various characters involved. She tied all the different ends together well.However, I feel that the ending could have been less violent. Did Ms. Lackey really have to blind Karal and disfigure Firesong.. Surely she could have achieved her objective in a less violent way"
1,"Lackey began with a good idea, then crashed and burned it.","I have been a fan of Lackey's since I first read Arrow's of the Queen, but I have to admitt that I was disappointed when I read Storm Breaking and the other two books in the trilogy. The underlying story of the mage storms was interesting but the developement was weak. In each of the books Karal is used a a mage channel to prevent desaster. I could see it happening once, possibly even twice, but not all three times. Lackey even brought back Vanyel and Stephen for this book and basicly did nothing with them in the end. Overall I can say I will probibly never read Lackey's new books with any regularity. She keeps recycling characters by putting new names on them and using them again and again. Sorry Lackey I used to love you but not any more."
3,"Good, Not as Strong as ""Brilliant in Chrome""","This is the third collection of short science-fiction stories from Phobos, and they have a good eye for emerging talent, but this collection underscores the need for more writers producing more good ideas. They essentially admit as much in the afterword.The stories in this collection are mostly strong, but none of them really light up the place like some in the earlier collection, ""Absolutely Brilliant in Chrome"".I recommend this to anyone who wants to invest in supporting new voices in SF, but if you just want a quick thrill, read the first two books instead."
1,12 Chapters of Boredom,"Bela Lugosi fans will have difficulty sitting through this amateurish Mascot serial. ""The Whispering Shadow"" (1933) is not even good for laughs. Since Mascot spent most of its budget on Lugosi's salary, the production values are nonexistent. Poor Bela is wasted in a typical red herring role. Cheap, cheap, cheap!"
1,"bad sound, if it works!!!","very bad electronics,horn sounds like a buzzing alarm clock!! not recomended!!!Look on you tube you'll see!!!"
1,Horrible choices for sounds,This unit sounds like a buzzer that you buy for a door bell; none of the options resemble a train sound.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED NOR WHAT WAS DEPICTED ON AMAZON IMAGE!!!!,"This tank did NOT have the Shell decal neither shell logo nor name on it. Not even a decal was provided in the flimsy box. Furthermore, the top half is separage from the bottom half and the activation button as well as the wiring for a power source (not included either) had not exit from inside the tank.....you'd have to drill a hole on the bottom edge for pass-thru x 2!!!! Extremely awkward, non-functional and worst of all, the horn sounds and the adjustment range do NOT even come close to the real sounds of either diesel nor steam engines....a simple train whistle functions a thousand time more realistically as well as a thousand times cheaper!!!! Total rip off......DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,Don't buy,"This is supposed to be HO Scale but it appears way too small - seems like it would be appropriate for N Scale. All of the pictures show a Shell logo and the words Shell, but mine arrived with no logo or words. The supposed diesel horn sound is a joke. Don't buy this. I'm sending it back."
5,Do they give us something to talk about?,"For the true Eddie and Gerald Levert fans, this is a culmination of the best work of two of the world's ""soul singers."" I was skeptical that they would be able to do justice to Something to Talk About, as I'm a big Bonnie Rait fan, but she would be proud of their cover. My personal favorite on this disc is the cover of Bread's ""Make It With You."" I realize how much I am going to miss Gerald's voice.If you are a fan, this is one you definitely must add to your collection."
1,Sadly Disappointed,"I was sadly disappointed with this CD. Unfortunately, it sounded like it was not completed prior to Gerald's untimely passing and Eddie's voice was digitally added to the tracks."
2,Hmmm,"The book was for sure not ""like new."" That was a lie. There was a ton of writing in it and the book is actually breaking apart."
2,No to an Mercedes E320,Does not fit my Mercedes E320. I dont know why it came up on the search for the door locks.
3,Okay for the right car,These do not work for an E55 AMG Mercedes. They are too short. Other then that they should work for some other vehicles.
5,Praise for the seller (and product),Thank you! I discovered to my dismay while getting ready for Hurricane Sandy that my maglite flash light was not working (I had thought it just needed new batteries). I ordered this Saturday and they got it to me Monday! I'm a bit more prepared for the impending power outage because the flashlight now works perfectly. This is the first product review I have every written.
4,Work as promised - could use tighter QC in manufacturing,"Not much to say about these except that they work. One of them had a small burr on the little flange around the bulb that I had to scrape down with a pocket knife before it would work properly. For this reason, I knocked off one star from the review. If you want to upgrade the brightness (and battery life) of your mag-lite, you might want to consider one of the ""LED Upgrade"" kits also available on Amazon."
4,Could not locate these bulbs at local hardware stores.,Have been satisfied with the original MAGLITE flashlights (especially the extra bulb located in the base cap). Found out (trial & error) that not all flashlight bulbs (despite appearance and fit) will work in these high end utility lamps. Letting someone borrow these excellant lites became a chore to have them returned.Haven't purchased the newer version MAGLITE & don't anticipate having to because of quality failure.
5,Forbidden Lusts and Ecstasies!,"CRYPTX is an amazing journey through the darkest passages of the human mind with side trips to issues as diverse as cannibalism, murder, immortality and spiritual fulfillment. Just when the reader is feeling adjusted to the weird world of criminal grave robbing, a new shock bursts from the pages. Again and again, as the reader's heart slows and adjusts from the rapid pounding pressure of the last experience, Mr. Knight thrusts you once again into an even more shocking twist. And when you finally put down the book ONLY BECAUSE YOU FINISHED READING THE LAST PAGE you are left with the feeling that maybe this isn't fiction at all. Scarey. Suspenseful. Shocking. A masterpiece."
4,Cryptx,"Cryptx is a fast moving, well written thriller with a good plot. The story revolves around a pair of star crossed lovers who are into robbing graves. Unfortunately, along the way they run afoul of a disgruntled spirit and the mob. From beginning to end, Ken Knight unloads with some real fascinating characters. Be sure to check out the mob hit-woman who seduces while poisoning her victims. It is wild stuff from start to finish. Buyers should be aware it comes crammed with graphic violence and wild sex. Buy It, If you like action, horror, and the occult. You won't be disappointed."
4,great band/cd,"I admit I bought this by accident thinking it was the band Air and the cd title ""All Along Air."" That being said I was not regretting my mistake once I listened in.I have listened to this one CD many times more than all of the Air cd's I have combined. It's more interesting, more aggressive, and diverse. It's also nothing like the band Air and should not be compared to them . . .even by me."
2,Poor quality product,"This was a Xmas gift for my daughter when she was 5 years old. We were all looking forward to playing with it, and it was on her wish list. You can imagine how very disappointed we were when we found the product does not work as expected. The parts are very colorful but when you set up the Oogly Googly monster, either his arms would continuously fall off or some other part of his body. It was a HUGE disappointment and especially for my daughter when we told her we would have to return it since it does not work as advertised. Simply put, another piece of overpriced junk."
1,The Cover is Better than the Contents,"I couldn't really find a lot of books on Industrial Style that seemed to emphasis the ideas/DIY style I was looking for. This book came up during one of my Amazon searches so I decided to order it. A bit more expensive than I wanted, but I thought the inspiration would be worth it. A total disappointment. Contents are pokey, old-fashioned and ugly. It looks like an old collection of government space-planning projects promoting ""the future of design."" It might be subtitled ""Industrial Style"" but there's nothing stylish about this one."
4,totally fine,book was exactly what i'd expected. no problems with condition or shipping. the item was sold for a fair price and this was a totally fine experience.
2,"A great cast, but poor plot","With all the big name actors in ""Shade"" I was expecting to see a good film, since I am a big fan of poker. However, this was not the case. ""Shade"" has some good acting, but the plot takes so many twists and turns, it's hard to keep track on what's going on.""Shade"" is about a group of con men who make a living coning people out of their money. For example, Jamie Foxx plays a character that joins the conn men and gets conned himself.The overall plot of ""Shade"" is for the conn men to get into a poker game with ""The Dean"" (Stallone).Overall, ""Shade"" had great potential, but there was too much conning going on. There should have been more straight up poker."
4,"Good film, lots of fun,.","I am a semi pro poker player and I had a lot of fun watching this nonsense. The cheating stuff was a great to see but, as usual the poker was ""movie poker"" not real world stuff. The guy who found it unwatchable probably hated every poker game in almost every movie ever made (I said ""almost""). The poker in this film was minimal and was obviously designed for a non poker audience.All that said, I liked the film, had a lot of fun and look forward to seeing more of these movies as Poker gets more and more popular."
4,"Not a cinemaphile, but hey...","Well I'm not great connesuier (however you spell that) of movies, but I am an fan of Byrne. I've at least noticed that when I follow his films, he usually picks the ones that are a bit a typical and have some kind of interesting element to the plot that will actually keep me in front of the tv for the whole movie instead of wandering off. And sometimes it isn't even the plot structure, sometimes it's just little nuances of the cast. Usually, when you go for one of his movies, I would say not to expect something like a huge blockbuster thriller or anything profoundly soul sucking. Compare the effect of these scripts as you would a miniature Monet to a huge canvas (early to late, like the waterlilies, for those familiar). Is the movie enjoyable and entertaining? Yes. Is it archetypal,...what isn't? Do all the actors polish off their portrayals, most definitely. And heck, for the price here, sacrifice your daily latte and check out a good flick for kicks, eh?"
5,Shade,"I had never heard or seen any previews of the movie. Talk about a great film on grifters. The cast was outstanding, especially Gabriel Byrne & Jamie Foxx. This movies grabs you from the beginning and the ending just blew my mind"" I had to back up to make sure I saw what I saw"" Whew!Does anyone know why this was never at the theaters or a leasy advertised?In closing I recommend Four Dogs Playing PokerMarsha Mays, San Diego, CA"
5,In Loving Memory @ Motown Gospel 2,"This is a very special positive gospel. I provide it for Christmas for friends and family. I also give it to people who are having a difficult problem, whether they have lost a loved one, have a health issue or any other challenge. This is one way to help focus on the love from God."
3,Lacking in odd ways,"This was an interesting story, but really not one of King's best. (I'd vote for ""Insomnia"" there.) There were two flaws, I felt. One was that I would have liked to have been given a bit more information, hints at least, about the nature of the society that would create such a contest, especially in the first fifty or so pages. The second flaw may bloom from the first; I simply could not achieve ""suspension of disbelief"", because I simply couldn't imagine that many kids volunteering for something with a 99% chance of certain death, and a 100% chance of extreme pain, suffering, humiliation, and horror."
3,"Seems only half researched, and unfinished","I read once that Jack Kerouac wrote On the Road without edits, with one single roll of taped-together paper scrolling through his typewriter. The Long Walk has that feel. It tells a story where the primary component is the interaction of participants in a contest that will spell the death of all but one of them. The reason behind the contest itself, and how it came to be, are left rather nebulous. Additionally, the story ends abruptly, and seems unfinished. I wonder if Stephen King got tired of writing it, and just tied if off suddenly. Among the other King novels I have read are Pet Semetary, The Stand, 11/22/63 and Bag of Bones. I like The Long Walk least, but still I found it interesting as a character study, and easily finished the book. 11/22/63 is a new King novel, and I recommend that one best of the King novels I have mentioned."
3,Didn't like the ending,Good story that kept my interest. End was anticlimactic after all that. Just kind of stopped and left me wanting more.
2,Too long for what it is,"I originally read this story as part of a series of short stories and it was extremely compelling. When I saw this book ten years later I had to read it. Unfortunately, the 300 page book is no different from the 30 page story. Really; I couldn't tell you what was added. The story is so basic and the true ""horror"" is in imagining yourself as part of this and what you would do, so it loses its appeal quickly. Maybe I had too high of expectations.I''m a huge Stephen King fan, but this belongs as a short, not as a novel. Imagine singing ""99 bottles of beer on the wall"" to the end and you get the point."
2,Wasted time reading this book,"The book itself is not a typical Stephen King horror book. It is more like a bad 80s slasher movie, which deals with a bunch of kids on some kind of a road race where losers are killed. I must admit that though I did not quite find it thrilling, once I had started reading it I wanted to know what it was really all about and how it would all end. Needless to say, I was angrily disappointed with the ending. There are much better Stephen King's novels out there, and this is certainly not one of the best. I do not find it to be even a good novel."
3,"Good book, Great story, Bad ending!",This was a really great story that pulled me in and had me cheering the characters but the ending totally sucked. King obviously didn't know how to end it. The book could have also been cut by close to a hundred pages and still have the same effect.
1,"The ""Long Walk"" is an exhausting read","Every year, 100 teenage boys are selected for the Long Walk. Everyone gets a canteen, processed food belts and 3 warnings. After 3, your simply shot. You must not walk under 4 mph, speed walk, or come to a complete stop. You must not harm or help the other walkers. An interesting premise, of course. But, how Stephen King, (Bachman) can write 370 pages of this psyche, it's very tiresome. It's very effective material, because as Ray Garraty, our protagonist, gets weaker and weaker throughout the walk, mentally and physically. YOU get weaker and weaker during the LONG read. I found myself staggering, tired, rushing to complete this book.And they walk on..and they walk on..and they walk on. A conversation...and they walk on. A 2 page flashback...and they walk on. New terrain...rain...and they walk on.This book is as excruciating to read, as this very review I'm sure."
2,Dont waste your time,"I have read 1000s of books and have rarely been disappointed. This story was a major disappointment. I will admit that it was an original idea for the time it was written but to be so invested in the characters and to simply end the story the way it ended was stupid. DO NOT waste your time. Go for a real walk and enjoy life! Hey King, you owe me $6.95 and 2 wasted evenings."
2,Tired legs,"Richard Bachman's OK, I guess, but he's no Stephen King. At least, not here. I was actually quite shocked at how shallow this book was -- King's tales are usually multi-layed wonders with unexpected twists and turns, but ""The Long Walk"" is so one-dimensional and underdeveloped that I had to keep glancing at the cover to make sure I hadn't picked up the wrong book by mistake. And don't even get me started on the ending, which is so graceless and sudden that it left me feeling like an amputee. Skip this one, kids...."
3,And the suspense is where?,"Disappointing. I love King, but this one drags on and on. The message he is trying to convey is subtle... really, like a sledgehammer on crystal. There is one storyline, and you keep reading on and on for a ""twist"", or something, anything OTHER than the long road. That's all you get. A long, boring road with one very straight-on conclusion."
2,Surprised by the high ratings,"I've read nearly all of Stephen King's/Richard Bachman's books. As much as I usually love his stories, the endings usually fall flat. This book, however, was boring the whole time. It dragged on. Then it just stopped. There's not even an attempt at a proper ending. Perhaps that's the point. Either way, was disappointed. It only earned the two stars I gave it for a couple of interesting scenes in the later chapters. I thought the book was finally getting good, but it didn't last. Oh well...on to my next read."
4,Did I miss something in the end???,"The Long Walk was a very good book where you really feel like you are walking along with the characters every step of the way. This was an unbelievably quick read for me because I was so eager to find out who would die next. However, the ending (don't worry, I won't give anything away) left me very upset. It didn't make much sense. It was the kind of ending where it just ends with no explanation whatsoever. Aside from this absolutely terrible ending, though, the other 369 pages were extremely well written and kept my attention throughout the whole journey."
3,Not the best,"I liked the book, but the ending was really wierd. Read the book. Oh, and the ending......if you reread it a few times you'll finally get it! (This also one of S.K.'s more gory books). In my opinion."
5,Ray Garraty: Maine's Own,"I have read many of Stephen King's books and I believe that Richard Bachman brings out the best in him. The Long Walk is the best book ever written in the entire world. I loved it. It's written in the eyes of a 16 year old boy so you get a feel of a 16 year old guy's wants and needs. Ray Garraty is in the contest where you have to ""walk out"" 99 other guys before you can get your prize. If you get three warnings, you get your ticket: death. I've finished reading it for the third time and every time I read something that I missed the time before. This is the only book you'll ever need cuz after you read it, you won't want to read any other book."
4,Like watching a car wreck in slow motion.,"Reading this book was like watching a car crash, you want to but you can't look away! This book was disturbing on a number of levels. You begin to feel the futility and exaustion of the boys as the book drags on, but you just can't stop reading until you reach the end, if you reach the end, but then what...?"
3,"Interesting, but ends up pointless","This book is about some young people who engage on a ""death march"" in a race that promises big rewards. It is a very different from many of King's other books. Is is quite an interesting read and keeps the reader aksing ""what happens next."" However, by the end of it the reader is left horriblt disapointed and asking himself, ""what is the point of it all?"" But this is only my opinion. I do not recommend this book."
3,Humanity at Its Worst,"It's almost comical. The way a parent would let their childjoin in with 99 other boys just to let them die. Life is precious andthey threw it all away at the hope of gaining everything. I was entrigued at how vulnerable we all were at that age and how the very thought of our dreams coming true would drive us to fight for our lives. King created a novel that stripped the mask from humanity and revealed the underbelly of society. To sacrifice your own child to a cause that wasn't worth his life. Like many others,I felt that the ending was disappointing. But I actually felt something for the characters that many other novels lack; emotion. Conratulations to King on a book that will anger even the calmest of people and humble the most offensive. This is life in its raw form. Bravo."
3,The Long Walk,It was a good book and kept me interested. Just a little disappointed in the ending. I would recommend it.
4,"mesmerizing , thought provoking. One of King's best stories.","I have read this story twice over the past month and find myself still troubled about the prospect of living in a twisted society that would condone The Long Walk. The story effectively made me feel the emotional and physical anguish of what it would be like to compete in such a walk. As far as the ending is concerned, I at first felt as if I was slapped in the face after page after page of building up to the ending. After careful thought, though, I understood the authors intent and I thinnkI would also, like Garrarty, keep on walkng..........."
5,Great,"""The Long Walk"" is very emotional and thought provoking. After reading it (it only took 2 days), my legs were sore. The characters are great, the plot may seem uninteresting but I couldn't put the book down. Some people disliked the ending, not me. It's classic Bachman. If you read the other Bachman books, particularly ""the Running Man"" (which is very similar to the walk) you won't dislike the ending. If the ending were different the book would suck. It had to end the way it did."
3,Thank Goodness for the Treadmill,"This book is creepy version of the future. To think that anyone would volunteer to walk for days without rest at four miles per hour is almost unbelievable. But Stephen King makes it believable. I probably would have enjoyed the book more if I had been born when the book was written and I had a vague idea of what the walkers were talking about. I don't know of any teenagers that talk like that.Every King fan should check this out. In my opinion, it doesn't compare to some of his better works, but is still worth a read."
5,How long would you make it?,"I started this book early one night and just kept reading. The chapter ends are so Strategically placed that you cant stop. Each character is described in depth, so you feel bad when each one dies. Each area of the race has a new problem,(my favorite was the 21 tounge salute). The objective in this was great. It reminds me of school. If you fall below a 65 3 times, they are just a warning. But if you fall below a 65 a fourth time, it's over. If you outlast everyone else you are set for life, but don't be the first to buy your ticket..."
5,My first Stephen King book,"This was the first Stephen King that I read. I didn't really know what to expect but the premise sounded interesting so I gave it a shot. I found that I was very attached to the characters and when bad things starting happening, I was surprised how much I was affected. Very good book. Highly recommended."
4,Go Pick It Up,"This was my first Stephen King book I've read, the whole idea of the plot itself is scary enough, to think if this was a actual situation you wonder how it would play outMy favorite part of this story is you actually care about the characters, I've read countless books where you get to the point you really don't... I could not stop reading this book and its very interesting seeing the relationships built with people they are competing agaisntThe very end left a bit something to be desired, I'm not sure what I was hoping for but overall was very pleased with the book, high recommend it to others"
5,hail,"i would have to say this is maybe Stephen King's best normal novel(meaning don't include The Stand or the Dark Tower). in my opinion, this is the scariest of all of his books, hands down. it delves deep into the human psyche and really makes you care about a few of the characters, and when they leave the story, it's a sad day indeed. anyway, it's short, so if you're one of the rare few that don't get into it, you won't be in for too much suffering. i recommend it to anyone that's ever read a book."
5,Unreal!,"It's the Future of reality TV. One Hundered boys start walking down the road. They have to go faster than four miles an hour and cannot slow down below that rate more than three times. If they do they are shot in the head. That's it. That's all there is to this masterpiece. One boy wins the prize, the rest pay the price. This is more of a psychological terror book than anything else. We are in the mind of sixteen year old Ray Garraty as he walks down the road. We learn the why people would walk, and what keeps them going, and what happens when death is less painful than the next step. As I read this book I could not help but wonder how long I could last. As Ray learns it is not about the fittest or the strongest or even who has the best shoes. To be champion of the long walk takes something more. Of all of Bachman's book this is the one that is most in need of being read. It truly is a great journey and one that every reader of terror must go on.Relic113"
4,The Long Walk,"I am an avid reader of Stephen King. This was the first book that made me wonder about the society these boys live that would allow them to take this walk. I loved the characters, friendships formed, and alliances that were forged and help among the boys to shield another. The only part that tore my heart out was the ending. After all that such heart break. I had to read the ending several times and then to my husband to get the whole meaning. Bravo Mr. King!"
2,Because It Kept Me Reading,"I really did not like this book at all. I typically enjoy King's books, however, the story is true to the title, The Loooooooooooooong Walk, felt like a longer read. I gave it two stars because I wanted to know what was going to happen and I was disappointed! I read the ending a couple of times and I am not sure how I am supposed to interpret it exactly. It just suddenly stopped. I don't want to spoil the ending, but can somebody help me with this?"
3,"good story, but left hanging","Stephen King is always a masterful storyteller, and it would be unfair to say that I didnt enjoy this story. It drew me in, and kept my interest. However, the ending left me wanting to know more...I know we are supposed to fill in the ""blank"" ourselves, and its fairly obvious what the outcome is, but it just didnt feel very satisfying to me...wanted a little more from the author. Having said that. I would still recommend it as a good read."
3,good story,They said the book was in good condition and I thought it didn't reach that classification. Got to remember when ordering a paperback book.
3,Book Review,I thought the. Idea for this book was pretty cool. I thought it was well written and easy to follow. I would like to see this adapted to a movie.The only negative point I see about this is the ending. I know the writer could have done so much better to end the story.
2,King's The Long Walk,Steven King is known for his suspense filled stories and edge of your seat tension. This story however failed to meet the expectations I have come to expect from King. This lacked the suspense of the dome and the creeps of Bag of Bones. If you are looking for a story of human suffering and tough choiches this is an acceptable read but if you want a true fright look for another King title cause this one does not deliver!
2,suspense yes horror no,This was an amazing suspenseful read but was there horror? no. the end is a nasty letdown.
3,Mobid and unsettling and terribly one tracked,"It's a long walk, no finish line and the last one walking wins. If you think that sounds like it might be a better short story than a novel over 300 pages, it probably would have. It's a very dark novel and most of the real content occurs within the minds of the main characters. They're just walking. For three hundred pages. Walking. I enjoyed it, but when I read it I had too much time on my hands. I wouldn't exactly call it a great book."
2,King pulls you in only to disappoint.,"The book begins slowly but soon, as with most King stories, you're hooked. You need to know why and how the boys came to walk the Long Walk. You're waiting for King to tell what really happens to the winner. But he doesn't. The book, like the walk, just ends. I've never been so disappointed in King's (or Bachman's) work."
4,A dark figure?,the end of the book i really dont understand what the dark figure is about. the rest of the book made for an exciting journey. you should of know by the tone of the book that it was intresting. its easy to figure out whos going to win.
1,The ONLY bad Stephen King novel I have ever read.,Awful. Absolutely and completely horrible. That is all that I can say about this novel.The End.
1,Complaint against title of book,"My complaint against Stephen King, whom I normally like his work is that he could not be original enough to come up with a title for this book that was not already used by another author (Rawicz) in 1956 on a subject that had nothing to do with this book. My message for any author of books, movies, or even song writers, Never create a piece of work and use a title for it that was already used by somebody else previously.King could have chosen ""A Long Walk"" or ""The Deadly Long Walk"" but dont be so unoriginal as to copy somebody else's title that has already been copyrighted. The penalty for doing so in this case, is that the average rating for the above book has now been decreased by my rating. This may actually cost King some money."
5,The way to go with King,"Out of all the King books I've read, this one ranks up there with the greats. It's not as long and enduring as The Stand, or It, but that's hardly a problem. This is one of those books you can read in a weekend. As soon as you start, it's hard to put down.The book offers a simply unique presence, 100 boys walk, until the last one stands. King's known for his imagination, and this book definitely stands out. It's not necessarily scary, but it's intense, and purely enthralling.You won't regret picking up The Long Walk. If I had to introduce Stephen King to anyone, this would be my book of choice."
5,"""The Long Walk"" by Stephen King","If you love Stephen King you will enjoy this book. It was very similar to the ""Hunger Games"" in as much as the world in it's current altered state has towns sponsor a walk of young boys in which if participants slow down, faint, get sick, or any number of other issues that interferes with their walking before they get to the finish line they are shot dead. I am always ambivilent about King's books but have come to love them."
4,Yes Yes Yes,"This was a great book, i belive I finished it in a day, the idea is crazy, a walk where if you stop you die! I mean, when you first hear it, you think, hmm, i can do that, but if you really start thinking about it, you find it sort of frightening. That's what the teens in this Stephen King book faced, and Im telling you, i loved it. The books keeps you entertained, there is not a page that lags. The reason I gave it four instead of five, is for the ending, which left me wanting more."
5,Stephen King,"I am a big fan of Stephen King. I have not read one of his books in awhile, so this was a pleasure getting back to his works. The man's mind is stimulating to say the least."
3,"A good read, but not immortal stuff.","King is a master plot-spinner. His pacing, with the possible exception of the last couple of chapters, is superb, and he's great at keeping the tension high. This is not, however, a novel for the ages. It's got engaging characters, several of whom you come to feel for, but they all too often speak with a kind of erudition that belies their years. There's a kind of commentary on the human condition, here, and a critique of contemporary society's obsession with the public display of pain & humiliation (think ""Fear Factor"" & ""Jerry Springer"") that, in a 1979 novel, seems pretty prophetic. But, when all is said and done, this is basically a beach book, and not the kind of work that repays the ""only-novel-you'd-take-to-a-desert-isle"" treatment."
4,"Good, but not his best","When I first read this book, I thought this would be one of King's worst works due to the rumors he had lost his touch, but I learned i was very wrong.As soon as I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. The concept of the walk is defiently an amazing idea the King has come up with, and puts out a very powerful message to the reader about... nah, just figure it out for yourself. BE SURE TO READ IT, OR YOU DEFIENTLY WILL MISS OUT ON A GREAT BOOK."
3,The long walk ends short,"I thought the book was very good, very true to Stephen King, but after a few chapters it got really repetitive and I started to lose interest but kept with it only to have it end so abruptly. Not bad, but not my favorite."
2,Oh come on...,I powered through this one expecting at least something for a payoff. But nothing really happened to make it seem worthwhile. My first King and likely my last...not sure what the hype for this guy is about. Must be a generational thing. Reminds me of watching a B movie from the eighties.
5,A brilliant novel,This is a book eveyone should read. It presents a horrifying picture of what the future can hold. Definetly one of Stephen Kings best novels.
4,This book is one of the greastest books I have ever read,The Long Walk is a book that will engulf you and your soul. Reading this book will give anyone a new look on life. To do as much as you can do in one day of your life.
3,Walking and walking.....,"There's no doubt that the premise of Stephen King's The Long Walk is interesting. 100 boys are in a contest to see who can walk the longest, if you go under four miles per hour three times, than you are killed. The last one standing gets whatever they want for the rest of their life. It certainly sounds promising enough, but the problem here is the whole book is walking. I guess that's the point, but the story must rely on the dialogue to keep interesting. The story follows Ray Garraty, who joins the Long Walk because.....he wants to die? The other characters are the ones that keep the story going, as they constantly talk, mess around, and eventually die. It's a grueling tale, but does it stay interesting? Not really. I felt no urge to read it again once I had finished it, but that's not to say I wasn't interested to see who dies when. The ending is not really clear and can be discussed for hours. The Long Walk isn't bad, but there are better Stephen King books."
3,TYOICAL KING TALE,"Although I do like reading King's work, this one was too depressing for me; but I still could not put it down!"
4,"Enjoyed it, but...","Stephen King is one of my favorite authors and most of his books are excellent. ""The Long Walk"" was no exception, but I didn't like how it ended."
4,Great character development.,"It speaks volumes of the human spirit. The people were real, as we're the emotions. It makes me think of the trail of tears and many other death marches. I am tired and I'm going to sleep. Isn't that what death is like. I wonder where we go when we sleep. Our brain is actually more active when we are asleep....I wonder where I will go tonight after I close my eyes. It's 1:32AM time to....sleep."
2,what happened,I thought I ordered a book and it came to me in a mini book. I am going to keep it. but I wish you would put somewhere that it is not the actual size book.
3,Interesting but incomplete.,"Although I did enjoy this book, I think that some parts were a little sick. The ending was incomplete in a sense that I wanted to know more. I wanted to har the major say that he was the winner just to confirm it. This book was the first Steven King book I've ever read and I liked it so its my third favorite book. It does make me want to read all of his other books."
2,Not What I Expected,I was so disappointed. The Long Walk was a Long Walk that I could not wait to end. :(
3,Considering the plot...,"""The Long Walk"" was a decent read when you consider that the only thing happening in the novel is the Long Walk. King does a good job in describing the physical and psychological effects the Walk has on the boys. It's not every author that can take something as mundane as walking and turn it into a horror novel.I wish King had gone into more detail as to why the boys signed up to do the walk in the first place. They weren't forced nor was there some law forcing the boys to participate. More information about the government that created the Walk would have added to the horror of the novel. I also agree with the other reviewers about how aburpt the novel seemed to end. The story didn't feel finished.Overall, ""The Long Walk"" was a enjoyable read, but one that won't stand out as a personal favorite."
4,Good but not great,"On the whole, this book was really good but the ending was kinda 'incomplete'. I don't really know how to describe it but I had this feeling like it wasn't totally finished yet... I knew right from the start that Garraty was going to out-walk them all. Another thing is that once more than one fourth of them had died, the rest of them just started dying too quickly. Apart from those few pointers, this book was very nice to read."
3,Human suffering and sacrifice ( with no purpose ),"Stephen dropped the ball here. If you are a King fan, you could skip this one and never miss anything."
2,"Horrible ending, not one of his best","Was a bit of a disturbing book that isn't for everyone. He left alot of things unexplained, which was annoying. The ending sucked, in my opinion. Far from one of his best novels."
3,Do you Dare To Walk?,"Before you even read this book, you'd never guess what it was about. The first time it happened, I had to read it again just to be sure I read it correctly. It's not a horror by any means and it's not even a thriller. The book is very repetitive but for some reason, not boring.Once again though, I'm confused with the ending. This is the third Stephen King book I've read where the ending doesn't make sense and I feel cheated.Overall, it was a decent book although I don't know I'd recommend it to many people."
5,Dead Men Walking,"Very simple storyline: Young men walking to death. If what is important is how a story is told, that is a wonderful story. It is pity that it is written by a popular writer who calls his books as ""fast-food""."
2,transparent,"I'm writing this as a counter-point to other reviews of ""The long walk"". In many ways, this is typical King; if you like this author, you will probably like this book. In other ways, King has written a truly transparent metaphor for the human condition. The story about a long walk in which you die if you stop walking suggests trite comparisons to our collective journey through life. The ending of the book also conjures up a parallel with the inevitability of death; the winner of the Long Walk doesn't truly win, he dies like the rest of the contestants, much as all of us will ultimately die regardless of our walk through life. Overall, this is the ""pulpy"" King at his pulpy best, and the ""philosophical"" King at his philosophical worst."
2,Are you kidding me?,"Despite this being a ""Richard Bachman"" novel, the book is a complete loss. You become easily lost from the beginning of the story and become entrapped into this vicious cycle of losing random characters back and forth. If you cannot keep up with the characters and what conversations that they have held with Ray Garraty, then you will be completely lost.I do not see how Stephen King came up with such a lame idea for a story! It's absolutely horrible and I would not recommend reading this one."
1,Who are these other readers?!,"This is was honestly one of the worst books I've ever read. I recently got on a Stephen King kick, and read (and enjoyed) The Stand (complete and uncut) followed by 11/22/63. I chose this one to read next since it seemed to have some pretty good reviews.BAD.IDEA. There is no better way to describe the plot than ""a long walk."" It was as dull as watching paint dry.100 kids go on a walk. They walked 5 miles. One died. They walked 5 more miles. Another dies. That's essentially how it reads. Just repeat that for 400 pages.I don't know who in their right mind is recommending this garbage, but save your sanity. Avoid it at all costs. Read one of the two mentioned previously, or Insomnia or Dreamcatcher - books by King I've read and loved (although I was greatly disappointed in the ending for The Stand, I'd still recommend it).This book is an embarassment to Stephen King's collection."
5,terrifying experience,"99 guys walk towards death.One walks towards glory.But he doesn't know.A great book about loss of innocence, about the border between life and death, about friendship. After reading this, you won't be afraid of any other horror story."
4,Almost got it Stephen,"Awesome book, minus one star for the ending. Even if Garraty died, it would have been more clear or satisfying than the ending given. i love the comradery that develops among the boys and i felt that i was one of them, just trying to stay alive. this book gripped me, as all of King's work does."
4,"Vintage, Classic King. A Great summer afternoon read...","I read this novella last year, this time in the collection, ""The Bachman Books"". It is similar in plot to King's, ""The Running Man"". This novel should wet the appetites of King's more discriminating fans. It's definately more Kingly than some of his recent novels, save, ""Bag of Bones"" which rocked!!!"
5,The best from the master of the genre.,"In my opinion, this is one of the King's best. It grabs you and doesn't let go until the very end. When I finished it, I was exhausted from all the walking I felt I had been doing while reading it. Although the subject matter is gruesome, you find that you can't put the book down."
4,Pretty good book,"not stephen kings greatest book. but it does a good job at keeping your attention.. very atmospheric, and had a memorable storyline.. with a surprising ending."
1,The Long Walk,"Normally, I love King's books. But The Long Walk is not one of them. When I was about 30, I realized that I did NOT have to finish every book I started. It is the author's job to keep me interested enough to keep on reading. Sadly, Mr. King did not keep me interested enough in this book to keep on reading."
2,item never received,"I received timely notification that my item was shipped, but I never received the item. After two inquiries, my purchase price was refunded."
1,The long story!,"By the time I finally got to the finish line, I felt like I just took the long walk myself. The story was drawn out and bland. I know this is obviously not the popular opinion here, but this was not one of my favorites. I couldn't wait to just be done with it."
1,Just awful! Really disturbing.,"I am a huge Stephen King fan, but I only got about one third of the way into this book. Once I realized the kids were all going to get shot dead (one by one, in the road, like dogs), the book kind of lost all appeal for me. I just couldn't get past the premise, knowing they were pretty much all going to die. The whole thing seemed ludicrous, that mothers would let their kids basically commit suicide or play some kind of slim-chances Russian Roulette. This book is really disturbing, even for SK (Bachman). There are only a few of SK's books I haven't been able to finish, this probably tops them all."
1,A young and inexperienced King,"I consider myself one of King's Constant Readers, but, I had no time for the likes of The Long Walk. The premise alone was ridiculous so maybe that is why this whole story did not appeal to me. This story is not worthy of King's name. ( He wrote this novel under the pseudonym Richard Bachman.) I read about one half of the book then simply skipped pages to the end. This is what I do when one of my favorite authors writes what I consider a ""dud"". Of course it will remain as part of my collection but he has written many, many better novels."
1,Not worth the money,This book was terrible. It was hard to follow and was never fully explained. Save your money and get something else.
1,The Long Walk,"I typically enjoy Stephen King novels, but this was pathetic. A painful read. Slow, tedious, boring. About half way through I only read one or two lines per page and that was sufficient. I would not buy this book."
2,No pay off for trudging through it.,"The book would have been much better with a bit more character development and a better ending. I never felt vested in any of the characters, and I wasn't sad to see them shot. The whole book was a long walk for me - just there and reading it for the sake of it. I had hoped for a great twist in the ending, but like my walks around the block, it just ended. There as nothing clever or scary about this book. For a King book, it was a big disappointment, and I'm sorry I payed almost 8 bucks for the Kindle version."
4,Best King book I have read....but....,"The best King book I have read. Actually it's the only good one I have read. As usual he ruins another book by a terrible ending. A great read though. Would have been a five star book except he quit when it came to the ending. Make up your own ending and enjoy this read. Another problem I have is, why couldn't we have some politicians on this walk...lol...."
3,Different,"I have long been a fan of Stephen King, and because of that I have been able to gather the energy to get through the Bachman books. This was a decent tale filled with different motivations. I felt the concept was a bit lame, so it was difficult to keep it interesting. Although the character building was not what we are used to from King, he manages to do what he does best and keeps us in suspense, right till the very end."
3,ehh its 'alright...',"I am a big stephen king fan because I love horror stories and anything that can give me a scare, and nothing does that more than my own imagination. This book is well written, but doesnt have all the adjectives and fear that King usually incorporates in his work. It reads well and is interesting but he has other books that are definately better."
2,Boring story that dragged for me,"I am sorry that I bought this book. As I read it, I looked forward to the end. The story dragged like the plot."
2,If you want a believable plot go elsewhere,"This is one of those books you look at and you say to yourself, this might be good. Then you realize within the first few pages that you've made a lot of mistakes in your life and if you were honest with yourself, you would never listen to your own advice.The problem with this book, other than the fact that it was written by Steven King, is that the plot is so implausible that you laugh at the absurdity. I was waiting to see what mental asylum these teens broke out of to join a competition in which there is a 99 percent chance you die. Perhaps this was Steven Kings way of saying ""I can put my name on anything and it will sell because my name is Steven F-ing King."" He then proves how gullible the public is by writing a book about walking. Wow. It made me want to crawl for a week in protest."
3,A bit disapointed,"After seeing the rating I was really excited about the book, It's one of the first novels of my favorite author, and sadly it shows. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great novel, but SK went a long way in developing his narrative thru his career. The characters are very cleverly tough, but lack the usual deepness of characters in other books, also I didn't get the usual imagery of other SK books. Probably it's a book that will communicate more with teens.Still it gives you a different perspective on SK, actually this was originally published using a pseudonym"
3,Predictable,"I love Stephen King Books. I have most of them in CD audio version. The Long Walk, was a journey where the main theme was how many possible stumbling blocks can you throw at a story that should have taken much less time to tell. With a predictable ending, I could see the ending coming from a mile off. In my view a good book but not worth a purchase, a loan from the library would be much better."
1,Very LONG,Longest book ever!!! Should have known by the title. After the first 100 pages I skipped to the end and still didn't miss anything.
1,TERRIBLE!!,"Not one thing in this book goes right. From the beginning to the end, it is slow, boring, and uninspired, NOT recommended!!!"
1,The Best Ending Ever!,"The only notable quality of this whole novella was the excellent, captivating and gripping ending. The rest of the book was simple, predictable and frustrating. I gave it a star for the ending alone. Just read the last 4 pages and all will be clear!"
1,the long walk,"The worst book I ever read, so boring!! The boy's walk, they slow down, they get shot!! End of story, so sorry I spent money on this book."
5,Richard Bachman Turned Into Stephen King And They Finally Sold A Few Copies Of This Book!!!,"This is a very tedious and stupid story about a bunch of losers who go on a long walk. If they don't walk fast enough then they get shot!!! Isn't that a wonderful story idea and that is about all there is to say about this highly overrated ""one note song"". I give this book 5 stars because when it was published under the Bachman name nobody bought it and when it was published under King's name it almost became a bestseller. King would have made an excellent ""Marketing Executive""."
4,"I loved it, but give us an ending!","I loved this book. I couldn't stop thinking about it when I wasn't reading it, and when I was reading, I couldn't stop! The characters were so well developed and so human that I wanted to see several of them win the walk, not just one. I hated to see some of my favorite characters get their ticket. The only complaint I had with this story, like many others, was the ending. I wanted a more complete conclusion. I may just be the kind of person that requires closure, but I really wanted a more detailed description of the end of the walk, since I had invested so much time and emotions in reading about walk itself.Definitely a great book though. Emotionally draining and very addictive!"
4,It's simply great...yeah...*BUT*...,"It was a wonderfully captivating story, scary in its idea, and frightfully haunting. I remember reading this story feverishly day and night, totally enchanted, thinking about it every moment. I was even subconsciously ""walking"" and ""talking"" to Ray and them in my sleep (well, not outloud, but thinking it). It's simply great...yeah...*BUT* I totally detested the ending. That's why I gave it a four-star. I don't know if it's my problem or not, but I just hated that kinda ending, ever since when dinos roamed the earth. However, it's still a highly recommanded read."
4,Highly entertaining,"I think King's greatest gift as a writer is that he often comes across as a good buddy telling you a wild story. The Long Walk is a perfect example of this. He excels at the detail level of character carmaraderie which pulls you into the story regardless of where it is headed. Here, it seems pretty clear, but we still don't want to stop listening."
5,One Of My All Time Stephen King Favs!!,I have read this short story over and over again! Whenever I find out a friend has never read Stephen King I always tell them to check out this story to get a taste of what he has to offer. So far they have all become big fans of his books.
3,Looking to Die - Then Come Walk With Us,"The setting is all American, New England with cheering spectators and hormone heavy competitors. The scene looks normal yet the game is a suicide ride with a winner takes all and losers are shot. Instead of a background of desperation or self-destructive depression, the boys carry on with conersations of everyday life. Their coversations gradually merge with similar vulger wit (smart kids talking dirty) that seems far from character of willing participants locked in an irrational game. Parental intervention is mysteriously passive as the kids are dropped off to their likely deaths like a scene of suburban summercamp. This is clearly the product of a young writer who casually suspends disbelief perhaps morbidly thinking that assisted suicide for teenagers would serve as a simple convenience."
4,"Enjoyable Read, but Different King than Usual","I read reviews on this book and they described the horror of the story, etc. However, it's certainly not horror on the level of IT or some of King's other works. I did enjoy it, as I believe any King fan would. However, don't expect one of his true horror stories.Steve"
4,Surprising,"This was the first Stephen king book I've read that wasn't horror and prior to reading I had the notion that Stephen king only wrote horror stories. After reading I was astounded at the diversity of his skills at writing. The character progression and development is quick paced and keeps you reading, the description of the scenes in the book color a vivid picture in your mind. This has become one of my favorite books, a very exciting read from front to back."
4,"Great, strange book","This is sort of science fiction, but not really. It is really psycho-horror. Its about an alternate socialist or communist or fascist america, where people march to their deaths in a contest. Very strange book, the horror is they are all young boys and they walk until they can't then they are shot or whatever. They walk to death, in a race of endurance. But there is not SF reason for this, or supernatural reason. Just a political one.The characters are all generally good. There are some things I had trouble getting over, such as the idea they didn't all start off terrified. I mean, if you know it is a march to the death, you should be terrified, they all start off too happy. Also, the whole point of the thing was somewhat shaky.This was one of his very first novels he wrote, I've heard his very first. So, from that angle, its quite good."
3,Enjoyed it . . . didn't love it,"Don't think there is more to this story than what is mentioned in the title. The whole book focuses on the long walk a group of 100 teenagers take in New England. During this walk, there are plenty of character moments and insight into who these people are. I would have loved to have read more about the society where this walk would happen. This book is not as strong, in my opinion, as the other Bachman book I read (THE RUNNING MAN). There are plenty of good moments in this novel, but there are also more areas where I felt the story dragged. I will say that the Bachman persona is surely a dark writer. Both of these books have featured very bleak outlooks on our society. I know that King often writes about dark topics (PET SEMETARY being a perfect example), but these two books are very dark."
3,"Perhaps meaningful, but tedious","Despite the importance and timelessness of Hesse's theme, I found the work tedious, mostly on the basis of his protagonist: essentially a bloodless eunich (or lacking virility, as a kinder mind put it). His answer to Nietzsche: a kindler, gentler Ubermensch is unfortunately just not very interesting. Nevertheless, I finished the work, perhaps because I was awaiting the legendary repudiation of Hesse's essential philosophy, which occurs, albeit rather weakly. The most moving concept in the novel, namely the Glass Bead Game itself, is disappointingly underdeveloped. Sure, accuse me of philistinism, but I have a sneaking suspicion that many other readers are similarly affected by Hesse's tedious style and milquetoast protagonist."
3,"Great, but not his best","A wonderful experience, but the themes have been explored many times over in Hesse's more lyrical works. At time I felt as though I was reading a more complex version of other Hesse novels. The construction is impeccable and lucid. Nevertheless, the style is less poetic than Siddhartha and more emotionally distant than Demian."
5,"Hesse's best...deep, thought-provoking, complex.","This is by far Hesse's best work. A book to be read againand again. A wonderful story revolving around the life of ayoung boy who finds his own way, in a deeply structuredsociety, and reaches the unwanted pinnacle of his ""career"".Hesse manages to create a character in Magister Ludi whomwe can love, admire and sympathize with and still causes usto examine our own priorities and lifestyles. There issomething new to be discovered with each re-reading of thistreasure."
1,A painful and unpleasant reading experience,"A respected friend of mine recommended I read this book and I tried so hard to like it, but in the end (and the beginning and middle) I just didn't. I agree with several other reviews who admit the first 50-100 pages are difficult to get past. My problem with the rest is NOTHING HAPPENS! At least nothing important or relevant. After turning each page I kept asking myself, ""What's the point? What's the plot?"" For me-and probably a lot of others out there-there isn't enough dialogue or action to keep me interested. And in the beginning it was much too confusing and complicated (vague?) to consume my interest."
3,"some good stuff, but too long","past 100 pages of the book, i was happy. it was an ok story line but i was still amused and taken by the beauty of such a game. then, i was drained after every chapter i finished. i got to something like page 270, and it seems like despite a few cool points here and there, that make you see things from anoter perspective, it's all long, drawn out, predictable, and unmoving. after all, what kind of real character would you expect to have such a perfect, easy, and fair life?"
2,I FEEL CHEATED!!!,"SPOILER WARNING!!! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!So Magister Ludi drowns at the end of the story, in a cold mountain lake in Switzerland. A whole incomprehensible story about Abraxas and the Glass Bead Game FOR THAT????I FEEL CHEATED!!!And now, a weather forecast..."
5,one of Hesse's best and that's saying a lot,"A college roommate recommended this to me in the late 60's. It led me to read a number of Hesse's books, but this remains one of my favorites. I was totally engrossed in the world of the novel and sorry when I came to the end of the book. Give it a try if you have never read it."
5,The greatest,"I have read all of Hesse's books, and grown from each. I tried to read The Glass Bead Game when I was 17 and couldn't make it past page 100 or so. I tried again when I was 20 and have not seen life the same since. In Siddhartha, Hesse told the meandering story of life as a river, but in The Glass Bead Game life is expressed as the unfolding of a perfect and precious blossom: sprouting, reaching, blossoming, and falling to the ground to enrich the flowers that come after. I have since read the book three more times, and am wealthier after each experience. This is, to me, the greatest novel of all time."
4,it's all thought,"Alright, I just finished reading this mammoth novel a few moments ago, except for the short stories at the end. The AP english class at my school had to read it last year and this year there were extra copies so I grabbed one thinking alright this might be fun. Well, I'll admit, I struggled with it. And I'm a pretty avid reader but I had to put it down and read other things in between. In the end though, it's remarkable. When Mann said this was a ""treasure of purest thought"" he hit the mark. The next to last chapter ""The Circular Letter"" changed my whole way of looking at this book. Yes, it's dry. And Yes, parts of it may seem boring and too drawn out. But for the reader that toils through it, it's an amazing novel and very deeply thought out. There are times I wanted to burn this book, but now I'm honestly very glad I read it. It's beautiful and more relevant to today's day and age than one might think. In that sense I suppose it's timeless."
1,Paris Shopping,I didn't use this book at all. I found it disappointing. Instead of grouped by district it was grouped by category so if you were in a certain area it was hard to tell which stores were in that district.
1,a total waste of both money and time,"As a frequent visitor to Paris and a dedicated schlepper I had high hopes when I read about some places that I didn't already know about in this book. Little did I know that 10 out of 12 places no longer existed and the 2 that did exist were extremely disappointing. I wasted many metro tickets, precious time in Paris not to mention the exhaustion/frustration factor. The author doesn't do her homework and the poor reader is the victim. I rate this book a minus 5 stars!"
2,others are better,"Good for a first-time visitor. If you've been to Paris before, you'll already know most of the information."
4,Memories,Hearing this music for the first time in 30 years brought tears to my eyes. I used to listen to this with my Daddy when i was a little girl. My Dad has been gone 10 years and this truely brought back wonderful memories. :)
1,"I wish I could rate it a ""0.""","I despised this printer. Set-up was easy, but it was a pain to keep the paper compartment completely dust free. If any dust settles on the paper at all, it results in white specks on the final print and you have to re-do it. Print time was about the same as a inkjet. It was also pretty noisy, but that wasn't a big issue for me. The real deal-breaker was that the colors were not at all realistic. They were completely oversaturated and inaccurate. I exchanged it for a Canon I-9900 Photo Printer and couldn't be happier with the new one."
3,A word of caution:,"I have not (yet) purchased this printer but the specs seem fine,BUT,for Windows users the ONLY driver provided by Kodak is for XP.If you use Win98 or WinME, you may wish to wait for Kodak to provide drivers for these still-popular Operating Systems."
1,Works good for a short time,"This printer was good for two months, then the paper started to mis-align in the printer. If you search the net, you will find this is a common problem with this model. The prints are excellent - professional quality, but be aware that it has a known issue that there doesn't seem to be a fix for. With the price for each paper replacement near $90, the price per print is now prohibitive compared to what you can get with inkjet.Unfortunately, if you're looking for an inexpensive dye sub printer, this just isn't reliable enough to justify the purchase."
1,A $10 rip off,"Slim ,is not the word for this small 190 page ""pocket book"".Totaly lacking in any comparative information about companies or there offerings.Did not help this ,first time traveler to Africa, at all, in deciding where or how to go on safari.Got more information in a hour ""Googling"" Safari.Took about an hour to read.Wish I had just ""skimmed""it at a book store.Buyer beware. First grade level.EG ""Drink lots of water when it is hot"" or ""best way to avoid malaria is do not get bitten"".Written for a person who has never travled anywhere.Amazon has always imposed some ""quality control"" and this is the first time I have felt totaly ""ripped off"" after buying one of their books."
2,Skimpy Look at African Wildlife Sites,The book is thin and the information included is even thinner. Hardly worth the purchase price.
1,Fodor's Hire an Editor!,"Advice from the author: ""take pets to the kennel...buy snacks and gum...check the weather"". This ""book"" is full of the obvious with little help for those planning a safari. To be fair the information on photography (they suggest that you bring lots of film) and their information about self drive safaris (they tell you that this is a safari where you drive yourself) is humorous. A section on ""Kahki Fever"" where the author warns unsuspecting safari tourists about the dangers of AIDS when having an expected sexual encounter with your ranger on safari is simply over the top. Fodor's Hire and Editor...Amazon Hire a Reader!"
5,HOT!! Waiting for a sequel...,"I usually do not read urban lit, I'm getting tired of the genre, but I have to admit, this book was good. It draws you in, because you cannot believe that the characters are going to go as far as they do. You find yourself turning the pages shaking your head in disbelief.Quick read and great book to read on during a lazy weekend."
4,Swing low!!,They were just a little bit crazy in this book!! It was good but they were CRAZZZZZZY!!! The sex scenes in this book were Fire Whewwwwwwww.
4,swingers,"this book was really interesting, it's a case of what goes around comes around, revenge is not always the answer."
2,"""HOT STUFF""",This book should be read by every man who would like to share their partner for their own selfish reasons. You may not like what you see. I enjoyed the details of every XXX encounter.
5,AMAZING!,This book was off the chain...I could wait to see what would happen next. People always say watch who you bring into your bedroom and this book has proven that some people are straight crazy....Mr. Ferguson you are on your way to the top......
4,Freaks,This book was a good read but kind of unbelievable. It made me look at my child's pediatrician funny lol.
3,Ok but predictable,"Wasn't exactly enthused with the plot while it had plenty of steamy scenes, just seemed like the characters never really evolved. If it hadn't been cheap would have wanted a refund."
2,"Old, but plentiful information","Well researched, but rests on its laurels. Many descriptions in this 1997 publication are unchanged from the previous edition, which I believe was 1992. If you publish twice a decade, at least update the research you did 5 years ago."
3,Didn't Make it,I did not make it to the Galapagos Islands however my brother was able to use it on his trip!
2,OK! could have been better,"I didn't like the look of the shoe - it was more appealing in the website than seeing it live - guess, that what's you get if you are web buyer."
1,What a joke!,"I could have purchased a better, fresher selection at my local liquor store for $20. About 1/3 of items listed were not included. Emphasis on cheap taffy. Weight made up by a giant box of Leaf Malted Milk balls. Ugh! I threw most of it out."
4,Very Satisfied Customer,I have to say this is an excellent surviellence software and is very useful. It does an excellent job of tracking all activities on my computer and it gives a fairly detailed report of all websites and chat rooms visited. It definately logs everything. Very good product.
5,it just makes me want to dance all night long,this song is full of energy. when i'm feeling down all i do is pop in the CD and i'm as good as i could ever be. keep it coming!
5,A landmark of 20th c. fiction,"Ivy Compton-Burnett may not be a household name, and may even be obscure among dedicated readers of literary fiction, but that shouldn't be the case. Writing almost entirely in dialogue, Compton-Burnett uses the frame of polite conversation in Victorian England in this novel to expose deeply flawed characters willing both to commit things like adultery, murder and a whole host of other acts leading up to a casually stunning final few chapters. The delightfully slithering way Compton-Burnett's characters behave in A House and Its Head make for feverish reading if you're willing to have a little patience at the start to get to know the many characters. Compton-Burnett's work is also interesting as a precursor to William Gaddis in its brilliant use of dialogue, but you should read A House and Its Head on its own merits and you'll absolutely be rewarded for your effort."
5,Easy and Delicious,"This machine is not only the easiest to use but there is no mess involved. The coffee discs come in different coffee strengths and are available on line with no charges for shipping. When you first place your order, a taster's display box is given for free. Decaf is also available in two different flavors. We have bought several other machines. This is the BEST! No need to go to those fancy restaurants anymore to get good espresso. The milk frother is also a great and easy feature on this machine."
5,Next Best Thing to Your Favorite Franchise Coffee Drinks,"I first tried this product at a family member's house and thought it was great! I found it simple to use; difficult to mess it up. It is much more cost effective than stopping for coffee in the morning, and is conveniently located in your kitchen so that you can have espresso any time. I encourage anyone that is a frequent espresso or actually any kind coffee drinker to purchase this item. May I also ad that it is extremely easy to clean. So, if you are not into a high maintenance item this is a dream come true. You just put in a capsule of whatever flavor espresso you want and then throw away the empty capsule. Enjoy!"
1,Not a good idea,I was very disappointed to learn that you have to use Nestle cannisters with this machine. This raises the cost and limits the selection of coffee for this machine. It should be stated more clearly in the on-line catalog.I am returning this product for a refund.Scott
3,Columbia Sportswear Kvichak Hat for Adults - L/XL - BARK,The hat design etc. is OK. However L/XL is more like Medium/Medium!!Had to off-load it to a kid.
3,Warmth for your Noggin,"A nice , lightweight cold weather hat for keeping your head warm.Little too tight on the ears, but other than that a well made and very warm fleece Kvichak.A good value and warm without weight."
3,Can't find the right size,"This beanie is warm, but the sizing is awful. I ordered a small/medium and returned it because it was way too small. I can't really imagine the small/medium fitting anyone but kids.After I got my refund, I ordered a large/X-large. I knew it was going to be way too big, since I have a normal sized head. I have to fold it once around the ears, and then shape it in at the top.As another reviewer mentioned, this beanie looks ridiculous on your head. The way it's shaped makes your head look like something's growing out of it.I would recommend this beanie if you want something warm and don't care about the way it looks. You might be better off getting a cheap one-size-fits-all beanie."
5,GREAT FIT,"This is a very good beanie. Fits mostly bigger heads and is very spacious. Easy to wash. The material is very comfortable, doesn't cause any itching feeling for me. Keeps in the heat very well. All in all this is a great beanie to have. Worth the price."
5,"finally, a clean copy!","I came to really enjoy this song on YouTube, but it wasn't available anywhere else. I wish this track would be added to a future ""best of"" compilation."
5,Good value,End nippers work good and a definite good value for the cost. I bought several and they work equally well. I highly recommend.
3,"Great lighter, not-so-great service","It's a Zippo. It's orange. The primary reason for getting this model was for camping and hiking. You drop it, it's easy to find. If you know what a Zippo is that you already know all about the quality and performance of this lighter. Keep it filled and it will not fail you. Period.The folks I ordered it from...not so much.I ordered from Burn Wholesale via Amazon. There was an initial delay that I inquired about that was never addressed or responded to. The second question was also ignored. It was the third request that was finally answered. Turned out that the postal service admitted to losing the package. This isn't anything I hold BURN responseble for, but it would have been nice if they would have given m some sort of heads up to so I knew what was going on. Reading other reviews leads me to believe that this was not an isolated problem with these guys.Don't ever worry about ordering a Zippo, just be warned when dealing with Burn."
5,Old School lighter,Just what I wanted. Built to last and it is hunter orange so you can't lose it in the woods.
5,Spectacular,"I wanted this Zippo for its color and matte finish. I was not dissapointed. The color and the matte finish are like a Miami sunset. For the price and its beauty, buy it. You will be glad you did. My sadness is that I will not use it because I don't have a life. I collect Zippos to fill my day. I'm glad that Amazon didn't wrap tape around the box."
5,Zippo,It's just the usual common zippo lighter didn't expect more or less got what I wanted. It shipped fast and got to my house sooner than expected awesome job love it.
5,This is an excellent book.,"The quality of this work is evident, from the high quality paper used in the book itself and the excellent photos, to the most important part of the book, the poker information contained within. This book seems to be geared towards those new to poker, however, even advanced players will be able to pick up useful concepts from this book. I personally found Chan's thoughts on recognizing and minimizing tilt to be extremely well layed out.Another area this book excels in is laying out how to examine the texture of the flop. This is similar to the ""flops you want"" section of Sklansky's work, but I believe this book does a better job of it.This book attempts to be many things, and suprisingly pulls it off, being both informative and entertaining. This book is well worth rereading and I am looking forward to the next volume in the series."
3,If you've read the rest......,"Dont use this book as your BREAD AND BUTTER book. It doesnt show you the intricute parts to playing poker. It goes over specific chunks of playing and theory, this book leaves a lof of gaps in terms of poker instruction. If you have read all of Sklansky's books, then this one might just be an interesting read. But it wont help improve your game much."
3,Good Beginner's Poker Book,"This book cover the basic rules and strategies of different poker games. Personally, I did not find this book very useful partially due to my participation in many tournaments and cash games weekly.All in all this book is nice to read, great for beginners, and printed on nice material, but I would not recommend for intermediate poker players. However, if you are often beat in cash games or tournaments then this book may be useful."
5,Classics!,"I am not as big a fan of the Blaze books as my kids are, but both of my kids really love them. Billy is a boy that loves his horse and he is very relatable. My son treasures every Blaze book he owns."
5,A New way to Communicate with your child,"What an adorable book. I first bought it because of the fun colors and charming looking characters. I started reading it to my son and he really latched on to the simple words and sounds. It was actually the first book he has taken an interest in, so I have been reading it to him pretty often.He points to the characters and while he started out with rasberries....Now ( in his own way ) he seems to be reading along with me. The good news is my 1 year old finally said his first word...the funny thing is, his first word happen to be Bleep!I think he actually thinks I am finally speaking his language!Thanks ""Minnie and Daddy"" You have 2 fans!AliLos Angeles, CA"
3,Where's the workout?,"I bought both the Kaplan Verbal book along with this one to study together. One, to be able to compare the strategies from the 2 companies; second, to get a really good ""workout"" to improve my score on the verbal section. What I found was that while the strategies between the two are similar, the Kaplan book gave more questions to practice with than the PR book did. However, the PR book definitely gives a more comprehensive grammar lesson than Kaplan does, and it also gives examples of ""ETS tendencies"" which is very helpful. All in all, if you're looking for a good english lesson review, this is a great book. But if you're looking for a ""workout"", go with the Official Guide or the Kaplan book."
3,Cracking the Gmat 2001 has what this book has and more~!,"Don't waste your money on this book thinking that this is an in depth verbal guide compared to the more comprehensive princeton review GMAt book. When buying this book, I thought that this book covered the verbal section in more depth than the comprehensive princeton review GMAT book since I struggle on the verbal section of the GMAT not the math. It doesn't. So pretty much I didnt get anything new out of this book. I applaud the Princeton review GMAT compreshensive book called ""Cracking the Gmat 2001 "". Buy the comprehensive book (the on that covers the math and verbal sections) even though you feel your verbal skills are much lower than your math skills. It does wonders and pretty much goes over everything this book does too."
2,kinda waste of money.,"I haven't worked out very much because there are not many exercises in this book at all and most of the tips are only common sense. It's fun to read, but not very useful or helpful. My verbal score was 65%. After i have read this book and finished all the exercises, it's still 65%."
4,Very good orchestral arrangements of classic Porter Songs.,"I have the LP version and am getting worried about it wearing out. Rich orchestral arrangements without a hint of ""Montovanti"" or ""101 Strings"". Lots of brass and instramental solos with string accompaniment."
5,home for the holidays,i loved it . thought it was one of his best. it was injoyable to listen too.its the best iloved it
5,Great Christmas Music!,"This is actually the only album of Glen Campbell's I've ever listened to. My dad got it on tape from some music club when I was a kid and gave it to me, and absolutely loved it! The only problem I have now is that I don't have it on CD and don't have a tape player available at the moment."
3,Just Ok.,"The serial itself is typical of this type of entertainment and its a fun watch. The sound and print quality was good for the most part but did have a few flawed places. My main complaint other than the annoying ""child star"" is the over the top advertising of Platinum. Before each chapter they made sure to let you know who produced it as well as a blurb appearing in the bottom right corner of the screen from time to time proclaiming it a Platinum production. The pros to this attempt are the price and the fact that Lon Chaney Jr. was included in the cast,although in a minor role. For the low price its worth a look for those enjoying this type of entertainment, just dont expect Flash Gordon quality."
4,Buy this one!!!,"I pay $1.97+s&h, and is better than any $10 or more, ""Crash"" Corrigan is great like the rest of the cast.Clear picture and great sound."
3,groom still waiting at the altar,"as of april 3rd still have not received this undersea kingdom , i look forward to it's arrival though"
5,This translation is excellent!,"This is an excellent translation of an amazing book.Not only does Greenberg's translation rhyme (as opposed to the free-verse versions of lesser translators), but it's a great deal more intelligible to modern American readers than the other translations I've read. Nothing has been dumbed down, this book radiates the same brilliance and wit as the German original.I highly recommend it."
4,Book description,"Enduring legend of the old philosopher who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power.Translated in a performing version by Robert David MacDonaldCover painting by Peter FarmerThe story of the philosopher-scientist who, in order to pierce the only mysteries unknown to him, sells his soul to the devil for a period of total knowledge and absolute power, is one of the most potent myths of our civilisation.Goethe's gigantic epic poem, the greatest dramatic work in German literature, has not attained the same degree of acceptance outside of Germany that such a masterpiece deserves.Now, at last, in a brilliant new translation, specifically made for, and already successfully produced in the theatre, the narrative sweep, shorn of metaphysical digressions and diversions is made accessible to both the reader and the playgoer..."
2,"Great Artist, Bad choice","What a horrible choice of songs passing for a so-called""Greatest Hits"" package...Since when has Laura Branigan been famous for singing Show Me Heaven, Dim All The Lights and The Power of Love...? What a fan like me wants is her own hits, thank you. Oh wait there they are, stuck at the end, like an afterthought...Ok, ok, so I'm exaggerating, the important hits are all here, and they sound great, but what makes people decide that a Laura Branigan Fan (which I am) is going to be interested in an album padded out with [poor] filler. There are loads of other excellent tracks that could have been included (Satisfaction, Close Enough, Hold Me, I'm Not The Only One, etc etc).A wasted opportunity."
2,The queen of trash,"This is one of the worst cds I've ever heard. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because Laura has an EXCEPTIONALLY good voice. But my praise for this cd ends there. I can't think of one song Laura sang that I like. All of them are boring and don't interest me at all. Laura Branigan is proof that not everything from the 80s is worth revisiting. Some of it is downright forgetable.The only cds I can think of that is worse than this one is Nirvana's 1991 ""classic"" Nevermind, and anything by Avril Lavigne."
3,The most underrated pop star of the 80s,"""Gloria"" is the official last song of disco. The disco era was pretty much dead when it came out, but this song revived it for a final encore.""Self Control"" will give you severe 80s nostalgia. It's perfect 80s pop.It's good that Celine Dion didn't mess much with the original ""The Power of Love"". Put to this song next to Chris DeBurgh's ""Lady in Red"" and Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"" and you'll get the class of '87 trilogy of pop ballads of doom. If you had any doubts Benigan could sing, you just had to listen to this song."
4,Graceful Vocal Queen of Yester years,"Who wouldn't luv to hear Laura Branigan? She's got the Vocals and is blessed with the voice thats oh so powerful and obsolutly clear n cool. Her Power of Love has ever been a hit. Also I like the voice of Jennifer Rush when she sings the same number but Laura Branigan has her flasy style and grace. The Lucky one is a very originally sung song esp. when Laura sings ...The lucky one and the music rolls by. Self Control is all time hits and my fav. Laura Branigan's Gloria is another of my very fav song and I luv the way she sings Calling gloria....I guess thats the best part of her vocals that the music vibrates loud behind her bold n loud clear voice! A cool collection and a must buy pick - Laura Branigans can't be a miss out especially listening this Christmas when its Music Time, Prime Time. Good Pick."
3,Talent poorly served by this set,"There is no doubt that Laura Branigan was a great vocal talent. This album is frustrating in that it misses so many opportunities to make it a really great compilation. Key tracks seem to be missing (for instance ""I Found Someone"", ""Maybe Tonight"", ""Imagination,"" ""Shattered Glass"", ""Moonlight On Water"" - there are so many) and this is silly, given the running time available on CD. ""The Essentials"" and - better yet - the import ""Very Best Of"" both provide more effective tracklistings than this album (IMO) This album is a basic starting point but really does not live up to its title.The time has come for a definitive Branigan compilation - to include the posthumously released tracks too and place them in context. I hope the label pays the late, lamented Ms Branigan a fitting tribute."
1,the best of laura branigan,i bought this cd because i used to love this girl her song gloria was my favorite. i was very disappointed in this cd... i learned my lesson never get it again....
4,Give me some Self Control!!!,"I bought this CD simply for three songs,,,Dim All The Lights,,Self Control,,Gloria,,,No matter how many remixes of LB songs there are ,,I feel the original versions of SC and Gloria are simply the best and her version of Donna Summer's DATL isn't too bad either,,,"
4,Fun and Annoying,The game is fun at the beginning as long as you pick a fighter and a healer otherwise you'll get beat constantly. If your healer runs out of mp then you are screwed. The game is fun overall but it can be really annoying when you get wiped out and lose half your money so save it constantly so you can just quit before you die and reload. The enemy magic casters do a lot of damage and if you are fighting three of them then you will die.
3,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","The game itself is unique and fun. It offers a play style that I have not ever experienced before. I'm not a gaming officionado, so another, similar style probably exists, but I don't know of it. It's addictive, though, and I'm into it. However it's got glitches. Make sure you save often, as it is prone to freezing up on you so that you lose your progress. If it were made better, it would be a really good game, but due to the bugs...kinda dampers gameplay."
3,Could be better,"I love RPGs but I'm not much of a dungeon crawler. The battle system is fun but it gets old fast. Everything else is just for show. Other than hiring other characters, gold is pretty much pointless. You get most of your armor from drops. Quests only reward you with gold and add nothing to the story or the world. You don't gain anything from talking to the towns people. You have a shop to sell unwanted items, a guild to take quests and change party, and Inn where you end up every time you die, a church to revive k.o. members, a pub that shows your rank.In each area you are tasked with unlocking the path to the next area and sometimes fight bosses. You'll spend more time walking from one place to another. You can't warp to the later levels so you'll have to walk all the way back from town if you want to grind your levels (and thats all you do in this game)The graphics are nice.I hear you have more character customization options in Valhalla Knights 2."
5,Caves and Caverns,Great book for younger kids! We read it before we visited the nearby caverns - think it helped them understand more - and appreciate it more!
2,Don't expect to learn much!,"Given that this is an informational book, I expected to find lots of info about caves and caverns, clearly described and detailed. The text is often confusing and raises more questions than it actually answers. This confusion is compounded by the artwork. The illustrations are appealing to the eye and well suited for children, but they do not work particularly well with this topic. The pictures that accompany the text are often confusing and do not interact well with the written word. (Not to mention the fact that all people represented in the art are white.) Actual photos might have been a better choice, esp. considering the age level. If you know a child who is interested in this topic and really wants to learn something about caves and caverns, this is not the book."
1,Inferior product,I bought this pot at Christmas. I bought it after much searching for products made in the USA. I used it twice and the nonstick surface bubbled and peeled off. I was very careful and followed the instructions on not using high heat. I also bought a Nordicware cookware set that is working awesome. The problem is obviously with the aluminum pans and not the black rangeware set.
2,Basic,"This book covers Budgie basics,and just the basics. I was left feeling like I only had about half of the information that I needed to know.The good news is that it is very easy to read, however if you're only buying one budgie book, I suggest picking one with a bit more substance."
3,"sorry, JB","now, obviously, my rating for this collection has little to do with the artist or even the songs on this disc. it's the collection itself that's subpar. some of the great ones are here, but the sound quality is poor and the whole thing is low on rhyme & reason. james is a genius, but this doesn't do his genius justice. there are oodles of better comps."
4,start sweatin now,"i saw james brown in minneapolis in 1981 and again in vegas in 1995. with or without a girdle, this man is smokin. this funky cd is all bad, horns, and just generally music that makes you want to get real hot and lathered. he was clearly workin on the razor's edge of funk sainthood. check it out. you will believe."
4,Time well spent,"This is a small movie, still very unknown but, in my opinion, definitely worth your time. It's quite a good effort and should be seen more widely. I happened to get to to see it awhile ago, really enjoyed it. Now that it's released on DVD, hope it won't stay obscure for long.If you like discovering little treasures that nobody else knows about, here you go!"
3,whey protein,Needed to try a different flavor. It's okay but I have to drink it fast or can't get it down. I think I'm just getting tired of having to drink protein.
4,Make a fantastic looking dinner table,I have white plates and they look wonderful on these chargers. I bought two sets. Really love them at Christmas.
