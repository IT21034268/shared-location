5,"Invisible Life, I have the Screenplay","I Recently read this novel for the second time. This time I read it for a diffrent reason. It is a good book and will make a wonderful independent movie. I will be finished writing the screenplay adaptation Xmas week of 2001. The author does not know that I have written the screenplay. I am going to try with great vigor to see if I can get the part of Kyle in the movie, if the movie gets made. This part was meant for me to do."
5,Pulls you in reading!,This was my first E. Lynn Harris novel. It was good. I think I'll read the other series as time permits.
4,invisible life: a novel,The book revealed to me a better understanding of the life and issues that confront the gay community in our American society
2,Get your Coffee while you read this book!,"This book was extremely boring, it was definately not a page turning. I expected more because of the rumors of the plot and from the Amazon reviews. If someone asked me what the book was about, all I can say is ""I don't know, it was a little bit of a love story and an attempt to explain homosexuality."" I doubt I will read the continuation. Get your coffee while reading."
3,Mixed reviews,"Ok. I have very mixed feelings about this book. I thought the book started out great. Then I think it just went downhill. Although I do think his writing is simple (a little to simple at some points) the story was intriguing. But then I just thought he rushed everything. Everything that happened with Candace and her disease, his relationship with Nicole. Simply rushed! There were times I didn't even feel he and Nicole were even together. I do think that his relationship with quinn had more depth. Also I did like the character of Kyle but to make him a hustler? UGH!! I hated that part!!.....Anywho I both loved and hated this book..."
4,Oh My,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I was very leary at first but I thought I'd take a chance. I enjoyed the book, although I found it to be very graphic. I like the fact that it was somewhat open-ended. It left reader wanting more. I have continued to read all of Mr. Harris' novels and I enjoyed all of them. Some are better than others. But one thing that is a sure bet-Basil Henderson is the central figure with many issues that leave this reader, at least, wanting to know more. My hats off to Mr. Harris because I was truly reluctant."
3,"PREACHING, PREACHING, PREACHING","I HAVE READ SEVERAL OF MR. HARRIS BOOKS, THIS WAS THE LEAST AMUSING. AT TIMES I FELT AS THOUGHT I WERE READING A LECTURE. THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH DEBTH TO THE CHARACTERS AND SEVERAL IMPORTANT ISSUES WERE RUSHED THROUGH. THE AIDS EPIDEMIC HAS BEEN BEAT TO DEATH. THE BOOK WAS RUSHED AND THE ENDING WAS ABRUPT."
3,Distorted View,"Before reading Invisible Life I considered myself to be a open-minded person, now I'm not too sure. I wanted to drown myself in the pages of the book and become one with the characters. Unfortunately, I found myself having to put it away at times so that I continue to stomach the pages to come. The homosexual nature of the novel distorted my judgement of the book and E. Lynn Harris. I could not appreciate the true genius behind the work because of my discomfort with homosexuality. As Raymond struggles to decide what or who is more important, I found it hard to be sympathetic. If you have a problem with homosexuality I suggest leaving this one on the shelf so that Harris can be appreciated by those who are more receptive to the lifestyle. I know he is a good writer and I would hate for anyone to give damaging criticism based on their own uneasiness. E. Lynn Harris, I appreciate your literary contribution but it just isn't for me."
1,"Sadly, Poor Writing.","E. Lynn Harris has one thing to his credit with this sorry attempt at a novel- that is he is probably the first to openly explore gay and 'down low' sexuality in the Black American context. But that is all this and his other books offer. His characters are undeveloped, as is the novel's plot. Making what could have been a rather interesting novel, quite boring. His writing is completely void of any kind of intrigue, vivid description, or even distinct style. One wonders how such poor writing, could have ever been published. Thankfully, I have not bought any of his books- and I will never borrow or read another!"
1,What am I missing?,I heard such good things about Mr. Harris' books and this novel in particular. I read the first paragraph and was a little disappointed. The writing is very simple. But whatever. I knew what the book was about and I really wanted to read it so I kept going. I made it to chapter 3 or 4 and gave up. The writing style is too simple and the characters are very one dimensional. Eric J. Dickey writes so much better than E. Lynn Harris. You can see everything Mr. Dickey writes and feel every emotion. I really tried to like Invisible Life but I just could'nt.
3,Okay Plot with sub-par descriptive prose,"I liked the story. It was my first experience with reading a book about bisexuality. Dialogue was the best part. Characters were not well-developed - I felt like I hardly knew his female love interest. Description was horrendous. Complete lack of colorful prose. I think this book derives its popularity from the fact that it is about bisexuality. If you like soap operas, you'll probably like this book. Though it is my first, it is definitely my last read of his work. Not worth the money I spent for it."
5,Best Book I ever read,This is the first book I ever read by E. Lynn Harris and have been hooked every since. It also changed my views on homosexuality I understand it alot better now.
5,Enlightment,"This book was excellent. I am just now discovering E. Lynn Harris, only because he recently came to my city and everyone was raving about him. I had to find out why. I read this book in two days, really 1 1/2 days. I have already moved to the next book and in the process of purchasing more. This book gave me a deeper understanding of bisexuality and the similar feelings they have with hetetosexuals. It was a page turner. I recommend this to anyone who believes our minds can be open."
2,"Ill-written, but revelatory of an intriguing demi-monde.","I read this book on the recommendation of a black co-worker who found it eye-opening. I thought it very sad. The main character seems to have no understanding of the forces driving his life and only seems to awaken from his self-centered focus at the end, when another character dies, a victim of the thoughtlessness all around them. Even then, there is little thought for where his life is leading the main character. Instead, the novel is just a series of unimportant events over the years, mostly described in terms that are materialistic and on the surface, of interest only because so different from the lives of most people. A disappointing experience."
2,Seems like it was written in a week...,"Mr. Harris should get at least two stars for effort. He tried. But he sacrificed the plot and important details for his descriptions. Some of them are very nice, some cliche. I think what needed attention was the fact that Raymond, after years of liking women, suddenly is attracted to men. More insight and more of his feelings were needed to make this 'transition' feel more real. It felt glossed over, as though Harris was in a hurry to finish the book. And his relationship with Nicole felt rushed--I think there needed to be more to it, so that I could actually feel something when it breaks down.If you want a better read of a confused homosexual boy, try Shyam Selvduari's Funny Boy. (Note to the reviewer from Georgia--God is LOVE. And it isn't up to you to judge. We ALL sin.)"
3,Invisible Life,"In order to enjoy this book I think that you clearly have to be ready accept the fact that Harris' main character, Raymond, actually believes he's ""bisexual"" and not fully gay. I consider myself open-minded but I honestly believe this book lacks originality."
2,Trite Trash,"The story may have been interesting, but is amateurish at best. It is certainly not enhanced by the terrible junior high school prose: insipid dialogue, cliches, hackneyed characters-- hardly an effort! The plot itself is short of atrocious. I hardly felt any sympathy for the main character, who is a male equivalent of ""the other woman"" and is selfish and an alcoholic. What's so annoying is that E. Lynn Harris tries his hardest to extract sympathy for him. Then to top it all off, he gives no resolution, leaving an unsatisfyed feeling in the end. Yibbish!"
5,An insightful look in the mind of the gay and bi community.,"This book was on of the most self revealing pieces of literiture I've ever read. It looks into the mind of the hetersexual, bisexual, and gay communities. The primary character find himself as a priciple player in world very different from the one he has been use to. As a result, he explores the life, love, ups and downs of being involved in a lifestyle that due to his bisexualiy must remain his ""Invisible Life""."
2,A Good Storyline Does Not Make A Good Book,"Let me start by saying that I have read several of Harris's books. They are easy reads and somewhat amusing. The storylines are really good (gay African-American men are not what we usually thing about when we think of homosexuality), the characters have their moments, but the writing needs work. I will admitt that after reading the book I did go through a moment of thought and I looked at relationships a little differently. Maybe that is what Harris wanted and if that is the case he did it.I can't rate the book any higher because there are so many books that can make you look at life differently with a beautiful writing style."
4,"Simple, yet Wonderful","The story line was wonderful. The writing could have been more complex, I think it would have made the book better. The sentences were very basic. I do like how he explored the topic by asking rhetorical questions, this technique made the reader think."
4,addictive,"I found this book for a buck at the Goodwill store. I've already read a few of the other books the author has written, and I enjoyed this book also.The prose, and story, left me wanting more and it was difficult to put this down. Good books always make for an easy read, which I seldom am able to focus long enough to read in the first place.I wish I could find more authors like this.Loved it."
4,A Must Read for Women,"Invisible Life was a true page-turner. I couldn't put the book down. I read this book in 2 days. The story although it was fiction opened my eyes to the possibility that there are alot of bi-sexual men. As I read I kept saying to myself, I don't want to know these things, however I couln't stop reading. Curiosity kept me turning the pages. Invisible Life delves into a world that most of us merely wonder about. It tells the story of one man coming to terms with his sexuality. He has always been attracted to women, however one night while in college, he has a sexual encounter with a man. He seems surprised that he actually did and liked such an encounter. I would recommend this book as a good read."
1,"Oh, Come On!","I just don't get it -- or maybe I do. Harris writes about confused black bisexual men and that makes some straight sisters and white folks comfortable. I could not relate to this book at all. Someone had the gall to call it ""afrocentric""? There ain't a thing about it that is -- unless one views portraying African-American men as sexually schizophrenic, emotionally empty, and spiritually bankrupt as ""afrocentric."" The only real character in this book is Kyle, the Brother who has it together -- and, what do you know, he turns out to be a hustler! I know self-hate when I read it and I think Mr. harris just doesn't like being gay. A sad tale -- on more than one level. Where's James Earl Hardy when ya need him"
2,Disappointed,"My goal for this summer was to get to know E. Lynn Harris' work. Well perhaps I should've started with a later work of his because ""Invisible Life"", his first novel (if I'm not mistaken) was a total disappointment. Besides the fact that there were grammatical errors in the book (mispunctuations and misspellings), the characters were also underdeveloped and boring to say the least. This book is supposed to be the first of a trilogy, but it did a poor job with making me anticipate the second one."
5,Cherish precious life,I'm a computer nerd often out of touch with real life. Brook's music brings me back in touch and energizes me. So much that I will end with one of my few poems:Cherish precious lifeMelodious rhythmic brookYou move me to act
5,A Must-Own,"Hardly anything to quibble with here. Chaplin is a genius to us adults, and hilarious to the ten-year old in my household. The major films are beautifully restored. I love watching them.Two quibbles: why weren't the excellent shorts given the same restoration quality?Also -- the two disks in my copy of ""The Chaplin Revue"" are mislabled. #1 is actually #2 and vice versa. I returned the set twice to try and correct this problem, but each time it was the same. Asleep at the wheel, Amazon. I decided to just live with it, which bothers me.Still I love watching these films and you will too."
5,WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS!,"This great and very diverse collection deserves to be in your collection if you are a chaplin fan!! It includes 6 movies, a collection of shorts ('the chaplin revue', which has seven shorts that amazon's description forgot to mention) and one documentary on chaplin only available through this set, and while not all the films are masterpieces, this is $100 retail for 6 films, 7 shorts and the documentary (12 discs) while buying them separately would cost $175 retail minus the documentary! And although I know that not every film in the set will have mass appeal, if you are planning to buy 'city lights' separately from this collection with one other from here, go for the set instead. The value screams for itself: all these films are unique and what has been done to restore them is fabulous. Dont pass it up!!"
1,Not the original films,"Despite the availability of the original versions of these films, they opted to use versions edited later in Chaplin's career to make them more palatable for modern audiences of the resurgence crowd. While not as noticeable on some of the films, The Kid and Woman of Paris suffer greatly from editing and deleted scenes. To add insult to injury, it's not indicated on the packaging that you aren't getting the real versions.The plus side is, the restoration is really great. The films that aren't too hacked up are great to see this sharp. Again, I just wish the real versions could have gotten this treatment. Sadly, I assume this will be the definitive DVD release of these titles, and we won't be seeing the original films turn up anytime soon.Should you prefer the edited versions, this set would definitely be right up your alley, because as I said, the restoration is great."
2,"""PLATINUM""? MMMM . . . NO, NOT SO MUCH!!","Nope, nope, nope . . . I've been a Chris Rea fan for three decades now, and although this collection has some of his best, its far from what I or others would typically call ""Platinum"". Where's Candles, Windy Town, Espresso Logic, All Summer Long, Shamrock Diaries, Working On It, King of the Beach, Nothing's Happening By The Sea, Love Turns To Lies, Driving Home For Christmas . . . etc?Sorry, but this collection is missing far too many of his sonic 'jewels' to be considered ""Platinum"". If it were me, I'd stick with New Light Through Old Windows, Shamrock Diaries, Water Sign and Wired To The Moon, and you'll have his ""platinum"" works. Or, better yet, if you're serious about Chris and his music, then I'd highly recommend his 3-CD collection ""The Works""."
5,A must own for serious metal fans,"If you loved the first album, prepare to experience your new addiction. Ever since being introduced to ""The Trees..."" I've been a fan of the technical insanity that is Sikth. With ""Death of a Dead Day"" they not only refined their sound with excellent production, but take the songwriting to a whole new level. Blazing riffs, catchy harmonized choruses, and an overall original sound that will have you craving more. This album was everything I hoped for and then some. Anyone describing this genius as ""horrible"" might want to pull up a seat with Eddie Trunk and listen to 1978 Judas Priest for awhile, because this definitely isn't your grandpappy's metal."
5,Best Karaoke I bought in years,"I love the karaoke machine,But I was surprize I didn't get a cd with it. Other than that it's a great gift.Thank you bonnie murray"
2,A guilty pleasure,"This is kind of an embarassment to Jay Ferguson. Why? It is a total sell out to just make money.Jay was in Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne. These were cool groups. He is far from cool on this album (what a fruity looking picture on the cover. Nice hair do Jay!).Setting that aside, Thunder Island was big in its time and totally reminiscent of the early 80's. Babylon is a re working of a far grittier Jo Jo Gunne tune. SOulin is okThis is trying to cash in on the Jimmy Buffet vibe. But Jay was a legit rocker so it is hard to take seriously. Its like if Richie Blackmore sang in a barbershop quartet or Keith Moon sang Brill Building songs.It is unnatural but definetly a guilty pleasure. Going from Run, run, run to Thunder Island...please!"
5,Awesome Tea!,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother, who has a terrible time finding good assortments of decaf tea. She called me just the other day and asked me where I found it, because she had already tried 3 or 4 different varieties and loves them all. I highly recommend Davidson's tea, and will definitely be making future purchases from them."
3,Good price but slow,It was a good price for the book. I sent it as a gift for my sister's birthday and ordered a week before the day. She received it about a week or so after her birthday which means it took a little over two weeks to get there. Not that great and it was hard for me to track online if it had been shipped or what was going on. It is strange because the reviews for this seller were really good especially on speed. but i think it was in good shape and she says she liked it so that is all the counts.
5,Surprisingly useful,"The strength of this guide is definitely its breadth, not its depth. This is an asset for curious people who don't want to lug around 10 separate identification books for plants, insects, snakes, etc. It also makes it more readable than your average single-subject field guide; my husband has read it cover-to-cover!We discovered this book on a friend's bookshelf and after we gave it back we kept finding ourselves wishing we had it along on hikes. Although we are fairly knowledgeable, outdoorsy people, but there's always something new we want to look up. Now that we have our own copy, we pack this book when we want to travel light, and it has been surprising how many times we could find what we were looking for, or come close enough to greatly speed further research when we got home."
5,Just as promised,"This is a nice little reference book to stick in the backpack or into the storage ottoman (where I keep it). We have birdfeeders outside the den windows and I have been able to identify some migratory birds I have never seen before. It is does not give in depth information, but you can identify most things you might be looking for while you are ""in the field"" and consult the internet later."
5,Kevin Yost's remix is the Tea,While Club 69 (Peter Rauhoffer) does a great job the real mix is by Kevin Yost!
4,strong single with unimpressive remixes,"""Five Fathoms"" is a brilliant track. Tracy's vocals are wonderful (as per usual) and the production work is way above par. So what the heck happened with the remixes? The Kevin Yost mixes do nothing to bring the track to another level, and the DJ Sneak dub is pretty uneventful. Peter Rauhofer (aka Club 69) does alright, but it doesn't compare to the original mix. They should have just extended the original and left it at that."
2,Only for Tarzan-History-Fans,"If you've seen the MGM Tarzans with Johnny Weissmuller, you can forget this DVD. It can serve best for History purposes. But you won't have another look at it again."
5,Symphonic Pop,"This album was the ultimate expression of the 1960's Bee Gees sound which Robin Gibb called ""Symphonic Pop"". Don't overpay for a used copy of this now-deleted disc, because I've got some great news for you fans: on January 12,2009, Reprise Records will release a Deluxe ""40th Anniversary"" 3-CD edition of the album, including the original album in both its' stereo and (unreleased in America) mono mixes, plus a 3rd disc containing 23 previously unreleased selections, including demos, alternate takes,alternate mixes,two unreleased songs(""Nobody's Someone"" & ""Pity"") and a promotional radio spot. The new set will reproduce the original ""flocked""(I.E. velvet-textured) album cover of the original 1969 L.P."
1,odessa,I been busy and want to tell you that there is a defect in the cd 3 songs do not play how can i return for a new cd? this is the first time i ordered and will be my last. very disappointed
1,"Aaaah, the Brother Gibb...","I loved them as disco-players, when I was young... I was ""too young"" when they were ""love-song players"", but they were ""great"" by same two ways..."
4,I miss that fake velvet gatefold sleeve...,"Maybe the most ambitious Bee Gees album? There is certainly some wonderful late 60s pop here. Originally released in 1969 as a double LP with luxurious gold lettering on faux red velvet foldout cover. The seven and a half minute title track is a mini-suite that's almost worth the price of admission in itself. There are also well integrated country influences (like everyone else they were listening to The Band), heartbreaking melodies worthy of Abba at their best, Spectoresque layer cakes of melody and grandeur, trippy Beach Boys influenced harmonies, and much much more. Does it all hold together as a cohesive whole? No, not really but there are so many fine things here that any self respecting explorer of '60s pop at it's most imaginative, owes it to themselves to delve within."
5,Odessa & Oracle,"Absolutely beautiful music is one way to describe this masterpeice that i'm sure few people have heard (Let me fathom a guess Hmmm...maybe because it's by the bee gees!)I read that jay fergueson from local has beens sloan (double live Phew!!)enjoyed this record and i had always been interested in the early bee gees so i promptly picked up.Didn't care for it much first time around,but then heard ""melody fair"" again on some best of compilation.And then it hit me like a ton o'bricks.Unadulterated power pop masterpeice!So please follow suit and get it!And when u put it in your machine press the program button and program it the following way.""never see my face"",""marley purt..""edison"",""melody.."",""suddenly"",""whisper.."",""lamplight"",""first of may"",2nd time round play the whole thing & be swept away by this record of absolute beauty"
2,The great lost Spinal Tap album,"How can there be a Sgt. Pepper-like 60s concept album from a famous band, that you've never heard of? The answer is simple... because it's mostly godawful. The same inadvertently hilarious attempt at seeming serious that made the Gibbs' acting in Sgt. Pepper a worldwide joke is on display here in galumphingly hamhanded and far too clearly enunciated lyrics on subjects like the circus and being lost at sea, set to lushly overblown orchestrations that would make an easy-listening station seem unplugged. All that could be forgiven as 60s naivete if the album were actually tuneful, but even the best-known song, Melody Fair, doesn't quite rise to the catchiness of Bee Gees hits like New York Mining Disaster 1941 or Massachusetts. All in all, Odessa suggests what the Beatles would have been like with three Pauls and no John or George, or maybe a Paul, an Art Garfunkel and a Dennis Wilson."
1,This album was originally melted down . . .,"Except for the red velvet cover and ""Edison,"" this album does not have anything to redeem it. It IS technically advanced for its era, and many of the advancements were put to good use by other artists. However, the brothers themselves didn't seem to grasp the possibilities in front of them. Keep in mind, this album sold so poorly that many hundreds of original pressings were melted down in order to reuse the vinyl for other albums. There is good reason."
5,Forgotten Vilcabamba,"It is hard to imagine any serious exploration into the Vilcabamba without first reading Vincent Lee's seminal book on the region. His extensive forays into this amazing corner of Peru are documented here in hugely readable style. Important historical breakthroughs, such as the discovery of the exact site of the final and decisive battle between the Incas and the Spanish, are intermixed with fascinating anecdotes about the difficulties of travelling in an area that, in the 1980's, was a hotbed of `Shining Path' terrorist activity. The post-conquest history of the Incas is well dealt with, but it is the maps that make this book so indispensable. As a trained architect Lee's plans of ruins such as Vitcos and Espiritu Pampa are so accurate and easy to follow that they have become the favoured guides used by both archaeologists and amateur visitors alike. Undoubtedly one of the most important books ever written about the Incas."
5,Great Book of Fairy Patterns,"If you want a Great book, get anything from Lora S. Irish, you will not be disappointed. Awesome."
4,Fair fairy drawing,This book is easy to use and to read with some amusing and interesting fairy facts the sketched and line drawings are worth a good look at and the part about the different types of wings is acurate and interesting.I love the book and the ideas for changing the types of fairy's eg attitude and style.
2,Not what I expected,"The art was not as refined or advanced as I expected it to be. I bought this for my daughter, who is an artist and enjoys creating 'fantasy-style' art through various media. I hoped this might inspire her and give her ideas to advance her skills, but her own work is already much more advanced than the patterns in this book. She is interested in patterns for clay sculpture and wood-carving, as well as sketches and oil media, but the 2 dimensional sketches in this book don't really support more than a beginner's guide to sketching fairies. If you are a beginner in the art of drawing fairies, this is probably a good choice. If you are intermediate or advanced as an artist, I suggest you look for something else."
2,Not High Caliber Art Work,"I agree with a couple of other reviewers that the art work in this book is not inspired, not is it particularly good. There are a lot of patterns in it, unfortunately they appear as though they came from a coloring book for children, only a very few are of a caliber that I would want to duplicate. It was disappointing, and I don't think it should be advertised as the ""ultimate"" anything. It's not for fine artists. It might perhaps be of use for inspiring small children to draw and paint fairies."
2,hard to understand,this was a text book for my class and it is hard to get but its very useful and i am happy i kept it after that class because like i said it is useful
1,i can't believe sony put this out,"unfortuately, i saw the review on these sonyheadphones after i had already ordered them. the otherreview which says how useless these are is making anunderstatement. the little plastic earclips won't evenhold the headphones on. a great concept but justa plain terrible design!! sound??? who knows, theywon't stay on your ears. i can't believe sony letthis out. further i can't believe sharper image didn'tcheck this product out before selling it"
1,Great Sound,"I bought this Sony Walkman to use while mowing the yard. My ears must be the wrong size or shape....I can't get them to stay on! The sound is great and they would be perfect if I could get them to hold. One small bump and they are falling off. Using them to walk is out of the question too. I wish they had different ear ""hooks."" I was very disappointed!"
2,Sony Walkman,"The sound quality is very good. The reception is average. The ear attachment is fine for walking, but will not stay put while jogging."
2,headphones,"MQ11 Walkman Digital FM Ear Clip Headphone Radio works great! I work in a big factory and they work good inside, you hear the music really great."
4,works great for in house seminar simulcast,It's been great for hearing a seminar where the speakers are placed about the room.The events are simulcast on a local radio frequency and ta da! I hear like I'm on stage.It's a little sore on the ears when wearing for hours at a time.Recommend it come with a protective box to protect the headphones when packed in luggage or in a purse.ThanksR in Texas
4,Eh...,"I've only read about the first 5 chapters but this what I gather from the book as a whole. While very informative and attention grabbing and different it to me should have (1) a different title. When I picked up the book I thought it would have more on the practices of the craft anf how the ideaology and practitioners have changed. I was wrong (from what I have read). It foucuses more on the events and people surrounding witches rather than the witch themselves.secondly I thought it seemed like a research paper. Actually, several. Each chapter begins with the idea and after a few pages the ideas seem to repeat and are represented by quotes or poems or any other work that is then cited at the end of the chapter.However despite these complaints the book is - as I said - a good read and while not addressing the witch persay it does present views I never would have thought of.A really good book to read. I would not suggest buying it...but then again I don't read history books multiple times."
3,Bewildered,"I haven't seen the show, but just by seeing the main photo for the series with the two leads sitting in the diner booth I can't expect the quality is great. I say this because the male lead some how has two hands, one on her thigh, and one around her arm. Check your photoshop, marketing directors!"
4,God forbid listening to the lyrics,"I love this album, Bob plays all the classics in acoustic form and nails each one. For those who tell you his voice is not up to par, well hear this, I don't listen to Bob Dylan for his voice. Though I love it (all the raspiness and inflection), god forbid you actually listen to the words in the song. That's not what he's famous for or anything.Another thing, to those who say the Byrds of Peter, Paul and Mary's versions of Dylan's songs are better. You are shallow and have no soul. The only reason those songs made it was due to the way they were written not the damn pretty voices and harmony those sell outs used. By the way, are those groups still around? Didn't think so.I saw Dylan in concert two years ago and though his voice is ultra-haggard, the inflection and passion is still there. End of Story. Buy this album if you like lyrics and songs not pretty voices."
4,One of his best,"Definitely one of his best ever. 'Shooting Star' is one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard, Dylan brings 'All Along the Watchtower' with all the energy needed, and you can hear he still believes that 'The Times They Are A-Changing'. 'John Brown', like 'With God On Our Side', is a song against war, written in full Vietnam-period, but still aplicable today, and sung with sadness and anger. The only other song that truly stands out is 'Desolation Row', a beautiful ballad of nonsense that still makes sense."
2,"...and uninspired, too","The critics showered Bob Dylan with praise after his appearance on MTV's Unplugged program, but this set demonstates that there was a lot of ""un"" from Dylan that night. In addition to being unplugged, he was also uninspired, unintelligible, underwhelmed, and unexciting. Dylan's rather high-pitched vocals did not do justice to his songs, and those songs--classic but tired warhorses like ""All Along the Watchtower"" and ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door""--needed more commitment from the singer than they received to offset the fact that they have appeared all too frequently on other live albums (including the dreary ""Dylan and the Dead""). A lot of lesser performers racked up huge sales and launched comebacks through this venue, but Dylan fared less well. A more adventurous song selection might have helped (the seldom heard ""Shooting Star"" is the best cut here), but more inspired vocals would have helped even more."
3,Misleading,"Even though this is very pretty, it looks more like a pie plate than a serving bowl. Its quite shallow, perfect to serve crepe's in."
2,Very dissapionted,My three year old loved this truck. But after only two weeks the entire back end broke off. Cheap plastic hinges! I would not recommend this truck if your child wants to play with it.
3,Disappointment,"My 4 year old son had been asking for this garbage truck for months. He got it for Christmas. He was so excited when he saw it, however, his smile quickly turned to a scream. He could not get it to stay together. All the parts kept falling off and he got very aggrivated. Everytime he tries to play with the garbage cans the whole back falls off. My husband and I have put this toy back together so many times that I could do it in my sleep. This garbage truck will not operate correctly and is not worth the 60.00 I paid for it. It is now sitting in the corner, where he occasionally pushes it around his playroom. I am just upset that he was so built up about what it could do, and we can't even get the thing to stay together."
1,Don't buy it,"I bought this garbage truck for my 3 year old son. He was thrilled when he saw it and for the first time he played with a toy by himself for more than an hour! HOWEVER after an hour the back end was broken as well as the mirrors and he got very upset. This truck looks great, but it is not durable. If it was $10 that wouldn't be a problem but for $60 it should have lasted for more than an hour!"
3,Middle of the Road,"My 4 year old nephew wanted this truck, and this truck only, for Christmas. A friend of his had it and he thought it was the coolest thing ever. He's having fun with it and it seems pretty sturdy (he rides it around the kitchen sometimes) but I find that the mechanism they use for releasing the back end garbage lift is very difficult for a 4 year old to operate. You kind of have to pinch it in from both sides simultaneously. I swear, it was difficult for ME to do the first couple of times and now I find he's always asking me to close it for him. That's the only set back though."
4,great toy for my 5 year old!,"my son just turned 5 in september and is obsessed with garbage trucks. he wanted a big truck for his birthday that didn't look cartoonish and had a ""smasher"". i was a little hesitant spending this much money, however, this truck so far has not been a disappointment. it holds up very well and we like how there is no need for batteries or flashy sounds or lights. he loves turning the knobs and watching the trash get smashed. well built toy, realistic and entertains my son. overall good product. i'll buy more from bruder in the future."
1,Nicole,My boys (ages 3 and 5) were so excited for this garbage truck but now it just makes them cry. When they lift the back to dump the garbage it always gets stuck up and I have to come and struggle with it to put it back down. Very dissapointed. I would definately not recommend this toy.
4,Garbage Truck Fun,"Bought this truck as a gift for my 4 year old. He loved it. It's not my first Bruder and these things can be a little fragile so need some amount of carefulness when handling. Having said that the realistic look and feel of the toy is great!! It provided hours of fun poking around putting things into the little bins provided, turning the knobs etc...unfortunately the attention it continues to receive compared to trucks that have more ""carrying"" capabilty has dropped. Kids love to put other toys soldeirs etc and transport them.One letdown with this toy was that it came without a windscreen unlike the MAN and SCANIA versions of other trucks i own.Overall a nice toy, and great shopping experience with amazon"
1,durability,after a week of playing with the bruder garbage truck it broke i dont know if it is the toy or my grandson and i dont know if i can and where to send it to be repaired. my grandson really like the toy very much.
4,Great truck,"My 3 year old loves this truck, but is too young to understand how to properly use its garbage pick-up feature."
5,"Great. Looks really good,",Better than OEM. Fit perfectly and has the room I was needing. I would recommend it for anyone with a gl1500.
2,Dissapointing,"I bought it 60% off of $3 so really didn't lose that much. It's a good thing too. Although the music is good and the girl has a good voice, her voice does not work with the music that they play. She'd be much better off doing a solo project with the music that can play alongside her. It's starts sounding like a rock band and then comes in her voice, which doesn't work for rock at all. I'm not saying that ""nobody in their right mind would like this cd"", I just didn't really like the combination they had."
4,Almost as good as the first,"Lacking a song as gorgeous as ""Paths of Desire,"" as stirring as ""Ariel,"" or ""Bury My Lovely,"" the 2nd October Project album falls just short of the debut album's glory. But with songs like ""Something More Than This,"" ""Deep As You Go"" and ""Johnny"" this is somewhat of a minor quibble. I'd give this 4 and a half stars if Amazon would let me. The first one gets five."
5,NOVEMBER PROJECT: NEW BAND NAME,"For all OP fans. November project (Emil Adler, and Julie Flanders (the amazing OP writers and musicians) are now joined by Maryanne Marina (new lead singer) on a pretty good CD-5. The new band name didn't impress me, but the musical sound and the vocals did. Mary Fahl and Maryanne have different voices. Both very beautiful, but Mary's carrying more uniqueness. I am pleased that we'll now have two bands to enjoy...the new November Project and the new Mary Fahl (not sure of the band name) songs. Both are presently touring."
5,One of my all-time favorites,"The two October Project albums (October Project and FFI) contain some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard. I wish the group had been able to stay together, because nothing the separate membrs have done since comes close. Multilayered lyrics, compelling instrumental work ... I can listen to these two albums for hours and never get tired of them."
5,An instrumental and vocal masterpiece! Masterful!,"A clockwork release like this one comes along rarely. 'FFI' is a sonic and musical MASTERPIECE! The songs are hauntingly beautiful with the tightest arrangements you will hear from any band. Mary Fahl's vocals are absolutely HAUNTING and incredible, rivaling and even surpassing Tori Amos' in another masterpiece called 'Little Earthquakes'! How their recording company managed to dismiss this band is an example of one of the biggest injustices and sheer dumb mistakes in the music industry, period! You MUST own this CD at any cost! Hunt it down today! You won't regret it!!!"
5,"Haunting, Chilling, Amazing!!!",I really can't describe how much I love this CD! Mary's voice is mesmorizing. These songs conjure dreams and memories in me like no others I've ever heard. I wish The October Project was still together as I have not heard a more amazing marriage of words and melodies in years. Mary's voice...God it makes me cry.
2,"2 absolutely great songs, then...","The debut October Project album (not ""Falling Farther In"") is among the very best pop/folk albums I've ever heard.Unfortunately, this sequel only has 2 songs that hit as hard (""Deep as you Go"" and ""Sunday Morning..."")."
2,Great music... but Mary Fahl needs to not sing!,"Yeah... I know they broke up, but this band would be truly amazing if they could have found a better singer. I was duped in to believing that OP had a similar sound to Grey Eye Glances. Now musically I can see the similarity, but Mary Fahl is NO Jennifer Nobel. Lucky for me I bought FFI as a used cd!!! Mary Fahl's vocal range is just too low to do justice to Julie Flander's lyrics and Emil Adler's music. This band is the total package. I can imagine the music being played on a soft rock or cool jazz station somewhere in the US, but the vocals just ruin what would otherwise be an easy four star cd. Let's hope the band reunites... with a different singer."
2,Poor quality,"Now I don't know about the music itself, as this was a gift, but the cover of the book was stained and dirty, and the pages inside also had dirty edges throughout."
1,no point,"the book starts with the death of a highly renowned pastry chef. then it goes to describe other characters, not even mentioning the death pf of the pastry chef. the description of the characters are very good, but they should be after most than 3/4 of the book are spent describing them. the murder isn't even discussed until the last 50 pages. and to me, the murder scenario, seemed like a let down."
4,I love it!,"this fitting sheet is soft and in high quality. the color is little different. after washed 3 times, it was still my favorite sheet. the size is big enough. the price is amazing."
4,one of the best records all year,"Here's another band that have not really tripped up over the past years. They always seem to release consistent records even though they are ignored by the press for the most part. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys quirky music with a great melodic sense. Start here or with Clairvoyance and you can't go wrong, but go with Clairvoyance if you like a more musically even record."
5,I Don't Know What You Don't Know,We love this show and having all episodes - with no adverts!! - is great. This boxed set is a great addition to your TV / Movie collection
5,Great Show! Tons of laughs!!,"We first watched the first season a few years ago, when some Canadian friends got it for us as a gift. We have since become huge fans and purchased the complete series. It is a show that can be watched over and over. It simply never gets old. It combines a sort of British-style humor with American influences. It is the best of both worlds.Canada got this one right. I am sad that the show ended after 6 seasons, but at least we don't have to worry about it lasting past its shelf life.Watch this show. Once you start, you can't stop."
4,Corner Gas,Great show @ a great price.If all people are like in the show it must be a great place to live.I love the their inside jokes.
5,Fantastic Show,"Just as Fawlty Towers is considered the greatest show in Great Britain ever, not just best comedy, the same can be said for Corner Gas in Canada. Started out by accidentally watching this thing at 3 a.m. after work one night on WGN. Almost immediately became one of my favorite comedies.It's kind of a combination of Seinfeld and Dick Van Dyke, if that makes any sense. It's something the entire family can enjoy without being boring. It's simply about a gas station in the country. That's it. Like any good comedy the writing has to be good of course, but the actors have to be good as well and they deliver...big time. I'll put this show up there with Seinfeld, Cheers, Dick Van Dyke, Community and News Radio. Once you watch a couple of episodes, there's a good chance you'll be hooked."
5,Best sitcom ever,"Corner Gas isn't a guilty pleasure - it's pure enjoyment. The cast of characters from a fictional small town in Saskatchewan may well represent folks from Anytown, USA. In fact, six of the actors hail from the Canadian province. No laugh track - you are the laugh track. Deadpan comedy, zingers, and making fun of everyday life are what this show is about. I guarantee viewers will recognize a character they relate to in real life."
5,Bigscream Tv : Crystal ball 3,"For any Halloween Freak like myself this adds great atmosphere to any display and takes over anamatronic props, Everyones attention seems to go to the crystal ball! This is a great addition to any Halloween display!"
3,At least the simulated exam software was good,"To be fair, the author describes this book to be a supplement to more comprehensive material. However, I don't feel the author did well with organizing the material. Even though it's supposed to contain only the essential 20% of the material you need to know, there is still a lot of material. The problems arise when you feel your memory is vague in a particular area. It's nearly imposible to go back and find the section of the book that focuses on that area in a reasonable amount of time. The simulated exams are excellent, but it might be helpful to know that there are questions on them that you will not find the answers to in the book. Another item to note is that the exam software that comes with the book is not on a supplemental CD, but is online. The book just gives you the URL a password. This means that if you can find a copy of the book to obtain the URL and password, you'll have the most valuable part of the book."
1,WASTE OF MONEY..........,"GIANT WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!Great glossy paper!Sharp clear photos of all kinds of show-winning car stereos!Don't look for the TECH on installs -IT AIN'T IN HERE!!!Don't look for the wiring diagrams or schematics-IT AIN'T IN HERE!!!Don't look for any material lists-IT AIN'T IN HERE!!!So-called ""tech"" covers less than the basic install info-you could LEARN MORE from the instructions THAT CAME WITH THE COMPONENTS!!!!Save your money, read your instructions that came with your gear!"
3,more trance,"Not the best I've heard, but then again far from the worst trance CD I have heard. Some ok tracks."
4,Not the best!,"This track isnt one of the best albums, and theres not alot of tracks on it, I think Ferry should of pushed it to 10 tracks a disc. The tracks arent upbeat or loud or anything like that, I think its one of those albums meant for a lazy saturday afternoon."
2,OMG this is DULL!,"I must say I was looking forward to Ferry releasing a new cd after hearing his ""Mixed Live"",and ""Right of Way"" discs,but this is NOT my style at all.This lacks energy,there are hardly any build-up's,and this is just plain boring!The 2nd cd is a little more uplifting,but still doesnt fall into my favorite 05'release category.In the future I will probably steer clear of any new releases...which is sad,because that's what direction most dj's are going in with the exception of a very few like Acosta,Micro,and Armin.Dance lovers,avoid this at all costs,and go get his best album ""Mixed Live""instead you'll thank me later!!!!if you love trance be sure to check out the three best releases of 2005 so far ....George Acosta-""Lost World"",Micro-""Tech Mix 5"" and Paul Van Dyk-""Politics of Dancing 2."""
5,FERRY! FERRY! FERRY!,This cd is what makes Ferry Corsten a mainstay in dance music. Ferry knows exactly what people want to hear and he takes you opn an incredible journey through his music. I have to admit CD2 is more to my liking with hit after hit. A must buy if you love trance!!
4,sent into a solid state,"Ferry defenitely delivers here. I`d say it`s an album that would speak deeply to any trance addict out there. There are some defenite ""floor pusher"" tracks, especially on the first disc, but not what I`d call filler. Some defenite key kuts include track 3 on the second disc, the dogzilla remix, as well as the remix of ""force of gravity"", a track I`ve always felt was to damn slow to be good for much of anything besides mix fodder, which Ferry defenitly puts to some good use. Defenitely worth having in your collection, not a party punk album: solid, buy it."
3,Not very impressed,"So, Ferry comes out with a cd just to make extra money is how I felt about this one. He is my favorite Dj, but I think this is not the Ferry that we know. I would not recommend purchasing this one and I would wait for 'Loud, Electronic, Ferocious' to come out."
3,"Get Creamfields, it's much better.","I can't believe all the 5 star ratings here. I guess it's all die hard Ferry fans who will give him 5 stars no matter what he puts out. This 2 disc set has some good tracks, but only here and there, and too many tracks are boring. His newer Creamfields trance mix on disc 2 blows either disc from this set out of the water. He opts for house on disc 1, and it's still good stuff. I highly recommend purchasing Creamfields over this one. Get it, then come back and tell me which one really deserves the 5 stars.You want the ultimate 2 disc trance set, get Cosmic Gate's Back to Back Volume 2."
4,Gap filler engineering book.,This book will fill the gaps that others left out. It has just the right amount of math and theory to cover what I could not find in other books. This is a great companion book and can stand on its own.
4,Sound Track: Devil In A Blue Dress,"The music from the movie was a very good rendition of the music from the period of time. However, the music quality on the CD was less than expected. While some recordings were clear and crisp, others ranged from Ok to poor (hissing, uneven sound levels, etc). I would have thought that all of the music used would have been re-mastered to the same level of quality. If you enjoy the music from that era, this is a good selection. However, if you enjoy quality sound along with your recordings, you may be disappointed."
5,Best Book On The Marx Brothers,"This book is the most delightful, most fun book about the Marx Brothers that I have ever read. It's a series of interviews with Groucho and his friends--friends like George Burns, Bill Cosby, Woody Allen. And the book is written in such a style that by the time you've read the whole book, you really feel like you've spent a lot of wonderful hours chatting with Groucho."
2,"Hello , Groucho KNOWS he's going","Unlike anything I have seen or read about the Marx Brothers, this book was,overall depressing. Constant focus on Groucho's mortality, especially his personal observation of it, were the main cause of this doom and gloom. Additionally, many stories of ""the good ol' days"" were repeated througout the book.Although I concur this is new material, the material is not uplifting - the impending fall of an icon"
5,HELLO I MUST BE GOING,"a wonderful bio of groucho, with wonderful stories by groucho's friends. a very warm book.HELLO, I MUST BE GOINGALAN"
1,Microsoft PR Phlegm Wastes Fallen Trees,"After starting out by saying that the products every business makes will be obsolete in three years because Bill Gates says his will be, the book continues as such a large Microsoft PR release that one wonders if its publisher has become a vanity press. Written on company time, with each word approved by the Flacks of Redmond, it offer little insight. And when the book flap boasts the author speaks with ""candor of a Microsoft VP"" one can bet he didn't testify at the antitrust trial -- or maybe he did. Buy PRIDE BEFORE THE FALL or WORLD WAR 3.0 if you want to find out how Microsoft does business, not this waste of felled trees."
5,Season 2 Episode Guide,Season 2 includes 13 episodes of nature education and adventures on 3 DVDs. The DVDs are packaged in a shiny paperboard foldable slipcase that can be inserted into a slim paperboard box.Disc 1:1. Florida: Exploring Pascua de Florida2. Guyana: Land of the Giants3.

3,Runs hot,The battery works just fine but it seems to run hotter than the original. A little bit scary but okay so far.
5,Great replacement battery,This has been a great replacement battery. The charge seems to last a good amount of time. Glad I made the purchase.
1,Latin Made Confusing!,"With scores of editorial oversights (tense mismatching, singular nouns translated as plural, etc.) this book is not only very confusing to the first-time Latin student, but also not worth spending your money on. A thorough editorial review would probably fix most of the problems, but since the last edition was published in 1992, it doesn't look like the publishing company cares too much.Publishing the book in this state is nothing short of a disservice to the public. I wasted my money on it. Don't you do the same."
1,Latin Made Wrong,"This text is loaded with typographical errors, mistranslations, and inconsistencies. It does not explain important points accurately, so that if you depend on it alone for instruction in Latin, you will learn the language incorrectly. For instance, the authors never mark long vowels, which, in some cases, changes the meaning of a text. Translations are inconsistent; sometimes third person is translated ""he"" and sometimes it is ""he, she or it"". One exercise translates all present tense verbs in the past tense.Using this book is not merely frustrating; it's counterproductive. Don't buy it."
2,"Latin Made Simple, Student Made Confused","This being my first Latin text, I cannot vouch for its correctness in Latin context--although it seems by the other reviews that this book has some consistent shortcomings in that area. However, as a student of other foreign languages(Spanish, French, and Japanese previously), I can decidedly say that the presentation in this book is confusing at best. The beginning chapters are filled with ""this is one way to do it"" explanations that are later contradicted with the correct (?) method. Teaching someone how to do something incorrectly for the mere purpose of simplification is an absolutely useless practice which should be stopped immediately. I would NOT recommend using this book as a learning aid without a Latin-fluent companion to help ""fix"" the book."
1,Auctor stultus est.,"Errata multa in libro sunt.Miserabile dictu, mihi necesse est reprobare librum istum.There are many errors in the book.Sad to say, I must repudiate the book."
1,What a waste. There are much better books out there!,"This book was not Latin Made Simple, but Latin Made by Simpletons. Wrong information, and a terrible learning technique as well. Instead of this, go get yourself a copy of Lingua Latina: Pars I: Familia Romana, by Hans Orberg, and then move to Wheelock's Latin. Together, these two books will get you off the ground.Stop buying this dry, emotionless, ridiculous book regurgitated from the 60's."
3,Ballads dominate this album,"The jewels of this album are held solely by the ballads. The rest of this album kinda fizzles, however...""How Does It Feel to Be Free"" is worth ten dollars all on its own. This song is a preview of music yet to come from this blossoming diva. Also notable is the single ""Today All Over Again,"" and ""Small Two Bedroom Starter."" The latter song is kind of corny, but Reba's delivery is believable and filled with emotion."
5,An early classic,"This 1981 album provided Reba with her first top five country hit, Today all over again, and included many other fine songs, including a stunning recording of Only you (and you alone), the old Platters hit from the fifties. Other great songs here include Gonna love you till the cows come home (also recorded by Janie Fricke) and How does it feel to be free.My favorite of all the songs here is Small two-bedroom starter, a song that tells the sad story of a house that is owned by a succession of couples each of whom has to sell and move on. It is a classic country song of the type you either love or hate.Reba recorded many fine albums in the eighties that are well worth seeking out and this is one of them, but if you are unfamiliar with Reba's Mercury recordings, I suggest you begin with Oklahoma girl, a double CD that contains many of her classic songs from this period, which I've already reviewed."
1,Content wont load,"I purchased this book to read on Kindle for iPad. When I first purchased the book, none of the pictures would load. I worked with Kindle/Amazon support to delete and redownload the book, get a new instance of the book and finally delete the app and reload content all of which didn't resolve the issue. The issue was to be escalated with support but so far to no avail."
4,I love the first picture,"The one that says ""I see you"". My 6-year-old found it kind of creepy, though. But I think he liked it too. Cute book."
2,Disappointed,"I found the book disappointing in that it ignores the five recognized species of native irises of the southeastern coastal states, some extending up the MississippiRiver valley as far as IL and OH. I. nelsonii may not be a true species and perhaps one or two in FL are entitled to species status. They are all, with their hybrids developed since the 1940's, generally included in the designation ""Louisiana Irises"", with an international society of several hundred members and are included in honors and awards of the American Iris Society. See the website ""SLI"". While the book may be the best available, what else is missing? We need something much better."
5,"As always, a super complete guide",So nice to have just enough info on plants and animals in a book small enough to carry on hikes. Well done. Fast shipping also.
3,SE US Audubon Guide,"Very nice, needed this info to supplement my knowledge of Kentucky. I livd in VA for 10 years and looking forward to the using the guide to plans trips during my retirement."
3,Great info if you can find it.,The book contains a lot of information. It has a lot of good pictures of plants and animals found in the Southeastern States. The info is difficult to access because not all entries a listed in the index. If you are willing to read the entire book you will gain much. But if you want to use it to identify animals and plants you have seen you have to go through each section page by page. A little intelligent thought about providing a proper index would have helped greatly.
4,Handy Resource!,"This is a great little book to keep in the car or carry with you on nature walks. I find that we refer to it almost weekly - either while we are out or just in the yard. We have identified many birds and trees we otherwise would not have known, as well as become familiar with the constellations.The pictures a nice, plus the descriptions give just enough that we know what we are looking at. Later, if we are so inclined, we can learn more about it online or at the library.It covers pretty much everything you would be interested in outdoors in the Southeast - Topography & Geology; Habitats; Conservation & Ecology; Weather; Night Sky; Plants; Animals; Parks & Preserves."
5,TOP NOTCH AS ALWAYS,"When I saw this offering I was second guessing as to what it was, figuring I had just about everything Joni James every recorded. Wow! Was I ever wrong. I had a couple, sure, but the bulk of the album was all new to me. As always her melodic little girl voice sounded great. If you like listening JJ, don' miss this one."
3,Unleash the power,"Ok I bought this Jensen sub a few months back now, but as it is only an 8inch it wasnt quite enough bass for me. I needed to fix this problem. I though gee this is a power amp right, if i want more bass i need a bigger sub but could not afford these. So in order to fix this problem I had a 10inch Pyramid car subwoofer that i had picked up at london drugs for 30 bucks canadian and I had a sealed box laying around for that as well. I installed the 10 in the new box, I then removed the 8 inch from the jensen box took the wires off of the sub and then added more wire onto the lead to reach the 10 inch box and plugged it in bass had been doubled and then some. That still was not enough. I proceeded to go out and buy a 12inch bandpass car subwoofer box($100cdn)and then a Clarion SRW1243 12"" SINGLE VOICE COIL SUBWOOFER($89cdn) WOW I can not beleive the sound from this!!!!!!!!!!!!! It performs the equivelent of any 800 to 1000 dollar powered woofer."
2,Kentridge himself more than animation,"This DVD features more of the artist talking than his animations. I was hoping for more of his artwork to show my class. It is an interesting sort of documentary, but left me wanting more."
4,Very good & practical ideas of how to leverage the Internet,"I have recommended, and bought, this book for many of my friends. It has very practical and useful ideas of how to leverage the Internet to produce incremental sales and reduce operational costs. Must read if you have, or don't have, an Internet business strategy."
3,Good points but platitude-laden,"This is a good book to skim through, to make sure you have your bases covered. Void of any major new insights."
5,Judson and Kelly understand e-Marketing!,"In HyperWars, Judson and Kelly describe a rapidly changing landscape of doing business online with compelling examples of how the day to day trenches operate. Further, they penetrate some of the critical issues which will reshape the retailer- consumer supply chain in the future."
5,A great book to explore the effects of the net on business,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It shows many of the ways that the Internet changes the business world. A must read for everyone that is interested in the future of commerce.
4,Never gets old or boring,"I purchsed this CD about a month after it was released. To this day, I still listen to the whole or ceratin songs at least monthly. I don't know how anyone could listen to this and not be moved. The Title Track will be part of my funeral services when I die. It's already in my Will"
3,A dose of Valium,"I have been a fan since the beginning. This somnolent offering has potential. I loved the stripped down passion of ""Dirt Floor"" a whole lot more. Hotel Vast Horizon is stripped down, but passion is what this Disc lacks. The tempo of every track is the same and slow. Faster tempo and spark would do many of these tunes justice. Either they were asleep during the recording sessions or they wanted us to fall asleep after listening."
4,Go to a Chris Whitley show,"and you'll understand what all these great reviews are all about. You either get it or you don't. Whatever he does, he's true to himself, and that inspires enormous respect. Get the CD at the show and skip the middleman...you'll get a great CD and you'll more directly help support his work."
3,What you must know before you buy this!,"If you are using this book in a class then your teacher will guide you through it, BUT--if you are using this book to review music theory you must know a few things. 1) ALL the exercises in this book come out of the Burkhart Anthology, so you must purchase that as well. 2)There are no answers supplied for ANYof the exercises. 3) This book covers the analytical form of music (types of phrases, binary and ternary forms), it is assumed you are skilled in complex chord and harmonic analysis already. Overall, the book is fairly clear and well-organized and uses plenty of musical examples."
4,used this text in undergrad GREAT!,I used this text in my undergradaute study of music and find it to be useful even today. Greens' explanations along with exerpts and examples makes form in music an interesting facet. It is for those who are ready to dive into form and analysis head first. I would not recommend it to a beginner with little or no hard-core theory knowledge.
2,Book bought for a class in school,"This book, Form in Tonal Music, isn't the best of books for use in classes. I have found from using it that it give great examples, however, it doesn't explain definitions of words very well at all. If you are looking for a good book for examples to go with another book that you might be using on the same subject, then I would recomend it. However, if this book is going to be used without another guide, I don't recomend it."
4,This is no toy,"This is an excellent product for the model builder who has to ""put it up"" every night. It is a good way to have everything set up so you can work at the kitchen table and not get glue or paint on your wife's prize. The light works well but is not as good as a permanently installed, brighter one with a circular magnifier. This one runs on D batteries which give it a long life time before replacement. Overall it works well but a dedicated work bench would be better."
2,tamiya work station with lens,"Over all the product was very good, how ever I find the lens hard to use and at times the magnifying part is not enough for the detailed work that I need to do. The light also has issues at times it will not turn on after switching on the switch and will not come on till I either move the arm or tap it. The item is well built and durable, but for the price I might have been better served buying a large cutting matt and a large stand magnifyer with light."
5,Emilie Richards Shines!,"Julia Warwick's lost her eyesight and the doctors say there's no physical reason for it. Hysterical blindness they call it. Her life is falling to pieces and she's desperately trying to put them back together. A husband she doesn't love, a daughter she adores, secrets that she keeps even from herself, and the man she loves but will never be able to have because he's in jail for killing her best friend. Christian Carver is serving a life sentence for murder until another man confesses to the murder. After nine long years, Christian is free to pick up the pieces of his life. He returns home to look for answers, to look for himself.What he and Julia both find as they take their journeys of discovery, will lead them to face their greatest obstacles, and maybe, just maybe find the greatest reward...love. Emilie Richards shines in Fox River!"
2,Teeny Tiny Tools,"My son truly enjoys gardening and the work that goes into it. We ordered this for him to actually use in the garden. Let's say that items in picture are not actual size. The tools are too small for a 5 year old to use. They are good quality and would stand the abuse, but they are small..in the 4 inch or less range. I would qualify this as a novelty item not a set of useful tools. I would simply buy tools and use the bag, but it wouldn't hold anything larger than the included items. This will become a gift to a 2 year old instead of what it was intended for.Be forewarned, these are too small for small hands and an adult wouldn't stand a chance of using them."
4,Interesting,This was a very interesting book! I read it on the flight to New York to go see the Rockettes. I have been to the city many times but I still found lots of new information in it. I thought the first chapter was the most interesting but the others were good as well.
3,the photos are black and white.,"it was ok. interesting reading, but no color photos except for the jacket. That was disappointing."
5,Well Made Basic Radio,"Here is a good basic AM/FM radio, that includes Short Wave Frequencies.You can use it on batteries (battery life is very good compared to other portable radios I've used, Two D Cell batteries are not included), or plug it in (adapter included).Reception for AM/FM is very good. However the short wave is not the greatest, but this could be due to my house not being in a good area for reception.It's very easy to use. Straight forward commands are in the instruction book (included). It has a nice handle to carry it, and it's a nice size. Naturally there is a telescopic antenna that rotates.All in all it's a nice radio!"
3,many many spelling errors,I'm a great Agatha Christie fan. So this was one of the first books I bought for my kindle. I love the book. 5 stars for that. But the spelling errors were horrific!! Especially words running into each other (are those considered spelling errors?) Anyway; it's very irritating and distracting. It seems like no one proof read the kindle version. The e-book is cheaper but we do pay money for it. I wish they would put just a bit more effort into it.
3,Bad formatting on a great story,"Let me start by saying that I love this novel. A mystery fan, I am just now reading my first Agatha Christie. The novel itself is wonderful. The characters are vivid, the plot moves fluently, and I am completely engaged in it. As an English teacher, however, I am very disappointed in the number of typographical errors. By chapter 12, I have noticed at least a dozen. My score of 3 stars is an average of 5 for the story, and 1 for quality of text. Hopefully not all Kindle books are this poorly prepared."
5,Love Poirot,This is one of my favorite Agatha Christie books. It is a lot of fun to read. I plan to read it several times!
3,"Good plot, but slow pacing","This was my first Hercule Poirot mystery, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The first half of the book was setup and seemed to drag a bit, but once the murder actually occurred the investigation and piecing together the evidence was very well-written and had enough twists and turns to keep me guessing until the end. I probably would have given this 4 stars if the setup hadn't taken so long...I much preferred Christie's ""And Then there Were None.""As far as genius detectives go, Hercule Poirot was okay, but I much prefer Sherlock Holmes or Dupin at this point. Poirot is much more kind and personable than either of them, but I find their arrogance or lack of social skills more entertaining. Poirot also frequently uses French phrases which are never translated (I could figure out about 3/4 of them without resorting to a French-English dictionary) and I found this obnoxious rather than endearing.Overall: Great plot, mildly interesting main character, overly slow pacing"
2,27 Typos in the Harper Collins eReader Version,"I have recently started reading A.C.'s books on my Kindle. I'm used to seeing some typos in the eReader versions of books, but I was appalled at seeing 27 in Death on the Nile! Mostly they were OCR typos, a space was needed between words or the space was misplaced. I tried to write to the publisher: Harper Collins, but found that their website was diabled as of 12/19/10. I really like reading these books on my Kindle, but so far, I've only found the Harper Collins versions. Are there others with less typos? Is there perhaps the complete works of Agatha Christie?"
1,This Review Refers to the Audio Version,"Though I think that David Suchet does well in his portrayal of Hercule Poirot in the TV show, he does an abominable job as the narrator of Death on the Nile. The voices with which he chose to endow some of the characters were ridiculous and ill-fitting. In particular, Colonel Race comes off sounding like a doofus with a speech impediment, which does not describe him at all. You'd think that Suchet or at least one other person had read The Man in the Brown Suit or Cards on the Table and gotten some idea of Race's character--and therefore what he might sound like when he spoke. Yeesh."
2,Like a Clue game,This book was predictable and reminded me of the game clue. I may not be an Agatha Christie fan. This was not the book for me.
5,GREAT BOOK!,I'm hooked to AC now b/c of this book. I am going to get her other 79 books to add to my collection!
4,Holds your interest,Interesting book. I had seen the movie and tried to tie up the characters in the book with the faces in the movie.Could not remember the outcome of the movie so the book held my interest until the finish.
3,Not for the outdoors,I purchased this to put up in my garage. Good thing. It is made with very thin fabric and the over all construction is cheap. You get what you pay for on this item.
4,Cleopatra- lived up to its name,"This is the kind of movie that should be made available more to different countries. Its funny, insightful and careful not to be presumptuous. It portrays friendship and life's second chances beautifully. Wish I could find more like this from around the world!Una pelicula que hace pensar y no presume ser mas de lo que es- una buena historia de amistad y oportunidades en la vida. Me gustaria encontrar mas peliculas como esta en el mercado mundial."
5,WOW!,"I can't say enough about this movie. So I won't. Buy it, rent it, borrow it from your library-but see it (unless you can't deal with subtitles!)."
3,Greta music,Nice picture but worth to see just to hear the incredible music> Hear: Me voy a Morir de AMor . Great
1,A stinker.,"This is a basic-level book for beginners without ANY programming experience according to its introduction. However, its section on introducing programming contains examples in Perl and C++. These languages are casually referred to and used as examples, which is unhelpful and confusing to the beginner just starting with VBScript as their first programming language. Also, the actual VBScript code presented does not work -- a major flaw. If you're a beginner, get VBScript for Dummies or Active Server Pages for Dummies and start with something that will actually make sense."
3,The information is wrong,"This is an 8-casette all-audio version, there are no CD's. I am in the middle (well, on chapter 5) of this book, and I have to say, it is not the way to learn. They say no reading required -- and it is an all audio course. But how would you like to hear the conjugation of a very without ever seeing it written??? I am returning this set."
2,Audio is too fast!,"I had no trouble following the first three lessons, but after that point, I found the audio to go much too fast to follow. One, the speakers talk too fast. Two, in some exercises, the pause between the prompt and the correct response is too short to let the learner formulate the appropriate response and say it.The content of this course seems pretty good, I just wish it were read more slowly."
2,Fast talkin' Italian,"This is the first time I have ever tried to use audio tapes to learn a language, so I really didn't know what to expect. I think before you buy this tape set, you may want to know that it's designed for long-term study, not as a last minute course in Italian. There are 35 lessons, and it's suggested that each lesson should be studied for 4-7 days. Also, the tape goes very fast and the Italian is spoken quickly, so it's difficult to match pronunciations. I tried to learn by listening in my car on the way to work, but it's difficult to do, unless I keep rewinding every few minutes and listen again. Although a little booklet is included, it's very small, but it helps to see how a word is spelled in italian. If I could do it over again, I would get something else, since I am trying to learn Italian QUICKLY."
1,How can this have a 4 star rating?,"...if the previous reviews bash the product and give it 3 and 5 stars, respectively?"
2,Not among her better effort,"Jane has written some wonderful books. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. There are too many ideas, most of them scattered and not well developed. There may be a good idea in there but its going to be hard to find. She has written some great books in the past and I prefer to remember those."
4,Cultural Anthropology,"This textbook is enriching and it introduces cross cultural studies, which I believe everybody should be familiar with. Cultural anthropology is both interesting and informative, therefore I recommend this textbook"
2,Biased articles,I've observed at least one grotesquely biased and unwarranted article within this book that creates an insulting and ethnocentric argument towards a subculture that goes against the entire purpose of anthropological objectivity. A book that preaches about evaluating and truly understanding cultures of all kinds should not allow for blindly opinionated segments in any instance. It is both derogatory and uneducated for such a thing to be allowed in this book. Because there is one instance of it there could very well be others. Teachers should read this text carefully before supplying it to unwitting students trying for form proper opinions of the world around them. Although the information is presented in a very clear and easy to understand manner is should not be taken at face value.
3,Cheaper Than Most Recent Edition Offered Thru Email.,"I have to admit the content of this book may be good, but I took a good look when it arrived and the old drawings and pictures did not grab my attention. Text is small too. I put it down and just picked it up for this review. Buy this book here as it is expensive if purchased in its latest edition. A hard core collectors reference no doubt most guns in this book are unobtainable unless bought from a collection for alot of money."
3,Wasn't the right nut.,"I suppose this would work on anothere application. Perhaps some American Racing wheels requiring a longer reach. But they don't fit a Dodge Charger 20"" wheel. Which is what I bought them for. Had to return them and go with an alternate source."
1,Socket provided is not compatible with stock lug wrench,"The website states that these are compatible with a 2006 Chevy Silverado PU. While the lugnut lock itself will fit on the wheels studs correctly the socket provided is larger than the stock OEM lug wrench that comes with the truck (the stock size is 22 mm while their socket looks like it is 1"" (does not even state on the packaging)). The problem with this is you will need to then pack another lug wrench or socket and breaker bar in your truck in case you get a flat. For this reason I returned the product as I did not want this additional hassle and expense. I went with Gorilla locks which provide a socket to remove them that is the same size as the stock OEM lug wrench that comes with the truck."
4,Here is a playwright with something to say,"And Pinter says it brilliantly by having his characters communicate so little. These are truly menacing portraits of ordinary people in ordinary situations. I felt very uneasy reading these plays, as if language in Pinter's world is steadily losing its ability to signify. I imagine acting in a Pinter play must be incredibly difficult. ""THE BIRTHDAY PARTY"" was fantastic. What exactly is a Pinter play? I wish I could say, definitively, but I'm at a loss. Mostly these people are terrified by people on the fringes of their lives(outside their windows, in the basement of an apartment, in the same inn) who don't reveal their intentions but seem to want to do harm to the main characters. Sometimes, I think that Pinter's characters recognize the menace within themselves and project it onto other people. Part of the greatness of Pinter's work is that I'm at a loss to explain it."
3,Saying Everything With Very Little,"Alas this isn't the best of his works - Death etc. was most impressive. But The Room and The Black and White make for fascinating reads, and should be even more exciting when staged. This should come before Beckett in anyone's reading."
5,Bad Boys Soundtrack Review!,"Yo, Wassup? This is THE best soundtrack available to buy right now, it's got great mix of dance and R&B etc You should also buy the video, thats even better than the soundtrack!"
3,Bad Boys Score,"This is a great CD. Though I'm not really into Hip Hop Rap & R&B;, the song goes well with the movie. I'm just disappointed that only one Mark Mancina score is included in this CD.I've downloaded some Mark Mancina Bad Boys Score from an anonymous user on the internet. The album title is ""Bad Boys Score Promo"" which includes tracks like :Car Jack 5:52Heroin Robbery 5:48JoJo Doesn't Know-Hello We're Negroes 6:01A Favor for Mike Lowrey 0:55Rich Cop, Poor Cop 1:08Somebody's Upstairs 4:18The Madam 1:10A Mixed Conversation 2:00Explosive Truck Chase 4:11Thanks For Everything (Mike) 0:51Lobby Shoot-Out & Foot Pursuit 4:17Do You Remember Club Hell 1:37Hangar 3, Bad Boys Arrive 8:02High Speed Chase, Finale 4:40The scores are really good! I hope an official Bad Boys Score CD will be released since a promo disc is made."
1,What the....??????????,"This CD is full of Rap stuff. I just want to ask - Where the hell is Mark Mancina's score???!!! It was great, where is it?Where are other his scores(Fair Game, Bait, Money Train, Speed 2)? There is only one Mancina's cue - ""Theme from BAD BOYS"" its brilliant, but 4 minutes is little to short to buy this album."
4,Great opportunity to appreciate celtic music in a fresh way,I love this CD and never tire of it. I hear new nuances with every listen.I'm eagerly awaiting their next release!
4,The Godz,"Hard Driving 70's rock and roll. This band opened for Blue Oyster Cult at the first concert I ever attended in 1976. I was an instant fan. This album is the Godz first, and I believe best album. Hard rockers can't go wrong having this album in their collection."
5,AHS Fan,"While I preferred season 1 over 2, I am continually surprised by the directions this show takes me. Both the writing and the acting are superb."
3,I had a hard time with it,"I loved season one and when I got Season two, first episode..I was totally lost and I it wasn't catching me like the first season.."
3,me no likey,"i really liked the first season but this one just didnt do it for me. first of all i think they tried to do too many things in one season. there was the serial killer, the aliens, the nazi doctor still doing experiments, the fear of lesbians, demonic possesion and many other freaks. every time the doctor would feed the things in the woods i kept expecting big foot and the yeti to pop out and maybe the loch ness would show up in one of the therapy tubs! lots of great actors and individual episodes would work but overall it was just ok. to end the season the episodes just started abruptly ending things, like the demonic nun that just dies and the devil doesnt pass to anyone else, and the last episode was just trying to tie everything up. the first season you knew there was no easy answer to everything and you were left thinking that there was still more to come with that house and i liked that, no pretty happy ending, it was messy like life."
4,American Horror Story Season Two,Season one was better. It was Scarier with a love story. Season two had too many story lines going at the same time.
3,Mediocre,I watched season 1 and season 2 based on some good reviews I had heard. The show tends to get a bit corny in parts but overall a decent show. I think most people would agree Lange steals the show and makes it worth the watch. I wonder if season 3 will be any good.
5,Jessica Lange - GENIUS,"It pushes more envelops than Season I, but it's incredible. Highly recommended viewing: Jessica Lange outdoes herself and the ensemble cast is superb!"
5,Didnt think I'd like,I didnt think i'd like the first season since i heard it wasnt going to be a continuation of the first season but i totally got in to it. I kinda wish that the same story would continue into another season since i get way into it. But i guess its okay since some of the same actors are in diff episodes ;)
4,Better than season 1,I kept seeing fairly good reviews on this and so I pushed myself to complete season 1. It was okay. But this Asylum Season 2 was much better with a talented star-studded cast. I would say it is on the campy side of fun/entertaining.
3,eh,"American Horror Story season 2 is a bit of a disappointment. I gave Season 1 five stars, and I do still anticipate each episode of 2. It is, however, really choppy, almost to the point of incoherence. Too many characters with little resolution, even too many characters on screen sometimes.. The alien, zombie, demon and psychopath elements of the story leave me, at the end of the day, with the feeling that whoever is telling this story,, isn't telling it very well. Jessica Lang is incomparable, Kit seems to be wondering about in a daze, and although there are some elements of the story line that are interesting, and well played; ultimately I just don't care"
5,American Horror Story Season 2,"We weren't sure about season 2, as season 1 was excellent and unique. The makers of the series have delivered, though, and it's the only series we make sure to tune into live, as opposed to waiting for the downloadable version. Great entertainment!"
4,The horror so far,"The season drops you into a new location, new story, familiar actors playing entirely different characters. The scares are still a mix of quick shocks and slower, more psychological hits that linger. It's got everything that made the first season a success and more. It starts a little quirky, though, a little more supernatural than I prefer, but as the story elements come together around the characters the first few episodes gather explanations from later episodes - the intrigue hits you and you can't stop watching despite it's ugly, terrifying nature."
3,Not as good as Season 1,"My husband and I really got into season 1. Once we started watching the second season we were a bit disapointed. It's ok. I would watch it for free, but def not going to pay to watch this."
3,Spooky shark,"Still spooky, but it was on the verge of jumping the shark. It had vastly different genres of scary going on in the same story line which seemed a bit disjointed and over stretched.Still appreciated the actors high quality performances and creepiness."
3,just gross in many ways,"This season is rather graphic and gross. Very different from season one. I expected it to be a similar feel as the first season, very disappointed. With the first season I could hardly wait until the next week, and I was trying to figure out what was going to happen all week. This one is more about butchering people, none of that in the first season. I preferred the haunted, thriller feel of the first season. Very much a let down this time!"
5,Sick and stylish.,Lurid fun. Love the period. Love the actors. The story is ridiculous. It is worth a viewing if you are a horror fan.
5,Great story,Looking for something to watch without having the bu-geezus scared out of me I found season one of AHS and was hooked. I fully expect season two will be just as captivating and it is off to a good start. If you want drama and suspense watch AHS.
5,great show,"love this show, scary, good cast and great plot. why am i required to write a certain amount of words.. thats stupid."
4,aliens?,Its a little weird since they throw aliens into it and it makes it not as scary as the first season...its mostly just weird. But you should still watch it!
3,But where's the kitchen sink?,"Actually, I like the series. The cast is wonderful, the setting in a lunatic asylum is great. But the writers just went all over the place with the plot this season. Is it a ghost story? A serial killer tale? Science fiction? I'm confused."
2,It was okay,"It us very disappointing after watching the first season of AHS. It is as if the writers are just trying too hard to make it violent, gory and disturbing."
4,AHS: Asylum,"In my opinion, ""Asylum"" isn't as good as the first season of AHS, but I still watch faithfully every week. Good Actors and nice plots"
4,Fine Episode,Good Quality. No issues streaming. The episode was very good. I am looking forward to the rest of the season.
4,Love it!,Interesting show. Twists and turns are enjoyable! Not predictive so it is a welcomed change to mundaine TV. Watch It!!!
5,Love it!,"This show is mysterious, dark, and compelling. I love the way they tie everything in together. So far, I am have only made it to episode 10, but I can't wait for a third season. Great show!"
4,Cool show,"The item is great and works as described. I would purchase this again if asked. Dont worry, Buy with confidence!"
5,American horror story season 2 ashlum,"American horror story season 2 ashlum: great, eeri, edge of your seat. Record 4 weeks at a time because I don;t want to wait."
4,love it,the horrific scenery that the show produced made this a nightmare of a television series. It is great for those horror nights with a group of friends.
3,AHS Season 2,"The second season for me was sort of a disappointment. There were a few surprises but overall I enjoyed Season 1 a lot better. What was up with the whole alien theme? It didn't seem to fit and it seemed pointless. This season was all over the place. It didn't seem to know where it was going or have one central theme. Aliens, demonically possessed nuns, Nazi scientists, serial killers, the horrible beginnings of mental health treatments (labotomy/ECT/conversion or re-assignment therapy (gay/lesbian). It was all over the map...and what was up with the whole ""Name Game"" musical number. It seemed to not fit."
4,Good season!,Watched this season with my Girlfriend over a period of months. We liked the first season better overall but this was entertaining nonetheless. I'd recommend watching that first though it is not required because this is a completely new integration of the cast members.Season 2 does not build on Season 1.
5,Great show,Tv show that keeps you thinking what might happen on the next episode.this shows has pretty good twists and turns
1,Worst ever,It was nothing like the first season. I guess that was the point but I did not enjoy it whatsoever.
1,Disgustingly Anti-Catholic Bigotry,"The portrayal of the Catholic Church in American Horror Story : Asylum is insulting, slanted, and twist. The priests are nun running the asylum are portrayed as perverts, hypocrites, and evildoers. And it tries to hide this bigotry under the guise of a horror genre set in the past. Moreover, the twisted imagery of Catholic symbols, contorting them into icons of evil, turned my stomach. This is just another example of the hypocrisy of Hollywood writers that bigotry is wrong unless it aimed at a majority group such as Christians. Portrayal of other religious or groups in this manner would never be permitted to be aired, so why should this form of anti-Catholic bigotry be tolerated. Do not waste your money on this trash. And if it costs you nothing to watch an episode, don't watch an episode out of protest. Do not tolerate bigotry of any form in any medium."
1,Over the top Gross,"I liked last years series, spooky and kept it interesting. This year they went wacko with the writing. It is disgusting and downright gross. Glad I didn't purchase the whole season! I love suspense, but not the sadistic torture, it lost the story line & focuses on cutting people up for fun. Really sad that this show has 5 star comments. I cant watch people abusing, torturing & cutting their limbs off people. It's sick & very disturbing!"
1,Not as good as first season,Really dissappointed - waste of money - story line is weak and photography is poor. I'd pass if I were you.
1,Awful,Violent and heartless. No storyline that I can tell except how brutel can people be to each other. Don't buy.
4,Great setting,"I think setting this show in an asylum gives it an opportunity for much more interesting stories and characters. It was hard to stay with one family in one house last season. By the end of season one I was exhausted and not willing to take so many leaps of faith. This season is already a huge improvement because the weirdness is spread around. Like all Ryan Murphy series, this one is very stylish with great music and a great cast"
2,What a disappointment,"I was so impress and delighted with season one. I was sure season two was going to be hit. To my dismay the second season is rather weak and the episodes at times are boring and not well connected. I must say the acting is superb, Jessica Lange and the rest of the cast deserve an A+. The script deserve an F in my opinion."
2,Felt Like I Needed a Shower After Each Episode,"**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT**Though I kept watching until the end, after about three episodes, I got tired of Season 2: it's too dark--literally--I had trouble seeing the action; too much gore (a self-inflicted, coat-hanger abortion, REALLY??); too much weird sci-fi; too much sadism (mommy rape? Yuck.); no real depth to the characters; and it lacked the sense of humor/quirkiness of the first season. I felt like I needed a shower after each episode.The more I think about Season 2 of AHS, the more I think I'll be skipping Season 3. Life is too short, and it's grim enough already."
4,Good but slow,"This show is great, but painfully slow. 1st season absolutely best. Second season was too unbelievable. Will continue to watch."
4,Best TV Horror,"This was a great show with many twist and turns. It was nice to see old faces (such as the gorgeous, Jessica Lange) and see new faces.I love how AHS kept A LOT of the actors from season 1 and carried them into season 2 but as drastically different types of characters. The evil minded Tate is now a sweet and mild mannered Kit!There were a few holes in the stories and few stories that ended abruptly as if the writers were bored with that storyline or simply didn't know how to wrap it up. But it was still a great show!"
5,Seriously Amazing Show,"I can not understand why anyone would complain about this show it is awesome. Unlike every other show that makes you watch 12 episodes of a show before something happens, AHS1 and 2 constantly has something to keep your attention. Yes the 1st season was the best but season 2 is still amazing. As for people complaining about the horror, goriness, scariness, or darkness of the show, its called American HORROR Story."
2,Not as good as Season 1,Very disappointed in this season. I loved season 1 though but season 2 was confusing as there was just so much going on. I was hoping for a continuation of season 1.
3,poor tie-in among the plot,"the first season of AHS had a really nice tie-in between the history of the house and the present tenants, but s2 AHS has a next to nothing historic tie-in relation. s2 AHS: story 5/5.... tie-in to present 1/5. show has great potential, they need not get complacent."
5,AWESOME!,This show is great the actors are perfect! I thought the first season was good but the second continues to impress.
5,Fantastic series!,"We had gotten rid of our dish, so we were extremely pleased to find that we could purchase this series from Amazon!! This series will leave you wanting more after every show! Definitely for a mature audience!"
4,Consistently disquieting,"I bought the first few episodes to catch up and am enjoying the series. I was skeptical that they could keep the story going for an entire series, but have been happily surprised with the evolving script. Excellent cast."
2,too scattered,I really enjoyed American Horror Story 1. I was hooked from the beginning.I found American 2 very disjointed. It was too horrific.
2,Constant shock value ... tiring.,"Loved the first season ... worthy of re-watching.While I enjoyed the start of the Second Season, I feel they are taking what appears to be a rich storytelling and devolving it into a gross-out fest.I don't mind startling scenarios. But there is not one heroic or sympathetic characters in the cast. They are each just selfish 'agenda driven' characters. And without a character aspiring for better, to defeat the horror, its just shock.Watch the first Season, watch the Walking Dead.As of now, I'm leaving the senseless disgust and mutilation of American Horror Story Season Two behind me."
5,Can't get enough,"Can't get enough- this show is so creepy and alluring and the acting is incredible , Zachary Quinto might be the creepiest actor of 2012"
5,Fantastic Show,Serial show that keeps the suspense and horror going. Great characters and acting. Great evolving story line. I love it!
1,Nothing like season 1 this was awful,I did not like this episode. It was nothing like season 1. I expected the second season would be more like the first one but it was not.
1,though it would be better,I loved season one from the first episode to the last. However I can't get into this season. I really hope they do another season of the horror house!
3,Went too far,"At least season 1 had some ""charm"". I love scary shows and films, but this one's just way too creepy and gory. I still watch it, and I will finish the season, but I will probably skip the episode Coat Hanger because I'm pregnant and the title alone makes me queasy."
4,Needed escape,"A really good, scary show that doesn't include gun violence, thank God. These folks know how to spin a tale that's oddly in tune with our times. I""m a little put-off by all the time shifting of the plot lines. I'm never quite sure which century I'm in. Nonetheless, great cast, lots of plot twisting. Well worth your time."
5,Awesome,We loved it. The cast and storylines are both great. I liked it much more than season 1. I can't wait til season 3.
3,Entertaining show - problem with HD,"We are having difficulty with the HD. Parts of the show blink green for a few seconds every minute or so. Anyone else having this problem? If we watch it in standard, the problem does way. hmm..."
5,Loved it!,"Once you have watched the first season, this second season is a must. Different situation & characters but the same type of action, edge of your seat action. Great Show!"
5,Look forward to every week,I have to join a Ryan Murphy fan club so I can read all of the books he has on institutions. I find them to be fascinating.
5,Twisted!,"Love it, sad the season is almost over! I really hope there will be another season coming soon! Jessica Lange deserves an award for her performance."
2,horrible ending to a good season,After such a great season with so many twists ending it with an hour long interview was aweful. I was so dissaponted. I expected more out of the season finale.
2,Whereass the first season was GREAT this one is grueling,"It's all about blood and gore, boring and not very smart. So far very dissapointed. Really liked the mystery and characters of the first season and find hating everyone in the second. It is ridiculous."
2,What A Mess,I loved the first season of AHS so I was excited to see a second season.I'm not exactly sure what they were smoking or shooting up when they wrote this but it is a complete mess.So many story lines that you can't keep up with them. It's like they took 4 or 5 different ideas for this season and crammed them all into one big (and sorry to say this again) MESS.
4,Loved Season 1,And looking forward to Season 2 - One drawback - do not like the OPENing credits - all the flashing of gross pictures - It takes away from the great series. I fast forward as I do like flashing-jittery pictures - they are not in the stories. Love that the same actors are playing different roles in this season. Great acting and story-line - Alfred Hitchcock would agree.
4,Fantastically inappropriate.... great character depth....,"I loved this show. The only reason why it did not get 5 stars is because in comparison to the beginning, the end felt rushed... I could sense the writers thinking, ""hey, we need to wrap this up!"" Beautifully shot, superb acting, really shocking at first... they pushed the envelope here and succeeded. Definitely watching season 1 now...."
3,it was ok but.....,LOVED season 1 but season 2 was a little to out there for me and the ending was very anti climactic.
5,The creepiest show on T.V.,"Wow, I am blown away by this show. It's like a 16 hour horror movie. Definitely worth watching. I wouldn't recommend watching it with your teen. A bit too adult for that."
5,AHS 2,"AWESOME!!!! look forward to season 3 and season 2 is not finished yet! thank God for amazon instant video, I no longer have cable so I can order these on my roku!"
5,american horror story season 2,this show is awsome. I haven't seen anything this good in a very long time since the fourth kind. i love it the actors are awsome thats why i gave it 5 stars!
5,Shows you must see,"I loved,loved,loved this show. I got a Kindle Fire for Christmas and this show was one that I downloaded to it. I had never heard of it. Well, was I hooked after the first episode. Can't wait for the next season to come out."
4,Nearly as good as season 1!,We'll see what the finale has to bring but my husband and I love this season nearly as much as we loved season 1. Looking forward to season 3 already!
5,super good,This is a great show with solid acting and story line. I count the days till it's on. You will love it
3,I want murder house back.,The show has completely changed. I'm trying to get in to it but I liked the first session. I find it weird that we have the same actors playing different character and a completely different story line. I do hope this new twist isn't the death of AHS.
5,Best Horror series ever,"First off let me say Jessica Lang is superb. She is brilliant and what a pleasure it is to see first class acting - a rare thing these days.This series is very creative, dark, twisted, intelligent and fantastically done.Thank you to all who are involved in the creation!"
5,Creepy...indeed,"I purchased the first episode with some Amazon Credit that they were giving out for Tweeting Amazon. Anyhow, I really enjoyed this episode and I am watching the 2nd one as I type this. I hope I do not get any nightmares but it is rather creepy. I like the fact that they are not predictable as to what is going to happen and they catch the audience by surprise. I highly recommend it."
5,If you enjoy horror this good stuff,"my fiance and I love to watch this show. we recommend this to any that likes horror, can't wait for the next episode."
5,Every episode like a movie,My son and I love American Horror Story. We especially loved season 1. Season 2 a little less although the story line is gripping and the acting is insane (no pun intended). I would watch the show just to see Jessica Lange alone - her acting seems effortless. She is priceless.
4,Scarier than the first season!,"Jessica Lange is in season 2 also, but the storyline is a completely different one.Do NOT watch this right before going to bed is all I have to say! ha ha"
4,Suzi Barney,So far I'm not that impressed. Season 1 had a much better storyline until the last episode which was a bomb and major disappointment. I love Jessica Lange and she is excellent in both Seasons which is mostly why I continue watching.
4,Good show.,"I think I like the first season a little better than the 2nd season here, but perhaps I only got used to the characters. I wasn't expecting a different plot, and characters for the 2nd season. This season takes place in an asylum, which seems like it could be creepier - however the first season seemed like they had a better edge on the creepy factor. Season 2 offers some of the actors to take on new characters and really show a range. It's hard to say much without spoilers.Zachary Quinto's new character for this season is better than his role in the first season. I'm looking forward to see what they do for season 3."
4,So far so good.,"I am enjoying this series so far. However, I think it's more spread out than season 1. There's a lot going on and I'm waiting for it all to come together. I must admit, Season 1 seemed a bit scarier though. More tension building vs shock value and gore. One of the things I am having major problems with though is the direction. At times I feel as if I am watching a music video with all the choppy editing and weird camera filters. This doesn't build tension in the story, just get's annoying and feels disjointed."
5,Creepy awesome!,"I love this series even though it sometimes goes a little too far, but James Cromwell and Jessica Lang are wonderful in it! You love to be disgusted to them."
5,Awesome Show,We love this show. the quality of the show on Amazon is also amazing. I gave up cable and do not regret it one bit! this show keeps you wondering what could possibly happen next!
2,Season two is not as thrilling,"Season One was more thrilling and less gory. This season is more slasher-esque, though some of it is still intriguing. It is interesting to see how the same cast has changed roles."
3,Not Season One!!,"This would have been an amazing first season. Since the 1st Season was so good, with so many twists, it is just second rate at this point. Very dissappointed that it is suppossedly not connected to the 1st season. We will see if there is a twist to make a connection since most of the actors are the same.Once again, good Horror and would have been great if the writers hadn't already set the bar so high with an exceptional first season. Still looking forward to what is going to happen and the true connection for the ending!"
5,Love it!,"Not as good as 1st season,but still very good! I am always at the edge of my seat!! The characters seem to have made it into the Asylum!"
3,Season 2,"I like this series, the second season was good but not as good as the first season. Just my opinion."
5,AWESOME!!!!,I LOVE this show!! I hope that they keep the American horror story series going.. Each year it gets better and the actors and actresses are awesome! This show is unlike any other and I am a horror movie freak!! Seeing it is worth every penny!!!
4,Entertaining - Good plots,A little disturbing at times but overall very good. Would recommend it and would would watch another series if there is one........
5,Not a disappointment,I watched American Horror Story season 1 and loved it. I have personal experience with religious life and nuns and although there are some moral issues for me because nuns are a significant part of the story line I have to say that Sister Jude became my favorite hero nun a few episodes back.
3,Stupid...unorganized story is nothing short of a stew of all things scary.,"Season finale of American Horror Story Season 2...so disappointing. They took a great haunting story (season 1) and abandoned it for nonsense aliens, nazis, zombies, insanity, the devil, sociopaths, etc. the only thing they left out...WAS HAUNTING!"
3,Not comparable to first season,"While the acting was good, it was difficult to identify with or like any of the characters. Some scenes seemed to be simply for shock value. Unlike season one, it felt disjointed. After following the Harmon's in season one, I as really looking forward to second season. Pretty disappointing."
2,Uncomfortable and Disturbing,"I watched the entire first season, but found it difficult to watch as it is basically a soft porn made for Prime Time with disturbing sexual situations. That just isn't ""entertainment"" in my book. Now zombies, on the other hand...."
2,No comparision to season 1,"I am on the 4th episode of Season 2, and so far I have been terribly disappointed. The storyline seems to be going nowhere, and I hate the demonic exorcist spin. Season 1 was interesting and full of surprises; it was bloody, yet very watchable. Season 2 is disgusting and stupid. You would think a show about an insane asylum would be interesting, but all season 2 consists of is sex and gore. That would be okay too if the show had a good plot. I can't believe the writers created such a terrible story line for an actress as amazing as Jessica Lange. She and Evan Peters are the only reason I am going to keep watching and pray it gets better."
1,Gratuitous imagery and absence of story line,"I really enjoyed the first season of AHS and eagerly anticipated American Horror Story Asylum. The first episode - good - compelling characters and a sinister atmosphere at the asylum. The second episode - ok - I didn't like it as much as Episode One, but I chalked that up to character and story development. That takes time. The following episode(s) - horrible. Gratuitous images, torture porn, storyline that is offensive to almost every religion, race and sexual preference. I can't watch anymore, I'm sorry to report."
1,Waste of time.,"I didn't see the episode. I had to ask for a credit. This I thought was a prime series, however, it seems only season 1 is."
1,ahs,"The show is awful. Couldn't figure out the plot, or jumped around to much. Last season was much better! I won't be watching the rest of season 2"
1,Lame,Lame. Lacks thought. Sorry I wasted the money and most of all my time watching! My six year old daughter could think of a better story line. I want my money back!!
2,This got too weird...,"Ha... Okay, someone complained about my review... so, I'll be less specific. It's a crappy show. SAVE YOUR MONEY...Happy now?~~~~~Edited Original Review~~~~~We were wondering what they were going to do for Season 2 after so many odd things happened in Season 1Season 2 has an odd spanking / sadistic streaking that just isn't our bag... Might be yours (no judgement!)... We didn't get past episode 4 or so...Love Jessica Lang, but a little too much sadism overall..."
5,Great series,"My husband, son and I all enjoy this show, the second season was more iinteresting than the first season was."
4,American Horror Story 2 Awesome!!,"I love this TV show! The acting is just outstanding,and i love that every year the actors get to play different characters. I really loved that they did not just focus on supernatural as horror but even the horror of what its like to lose your mind,or think that your losing your mind,and the horrors of how so many people are treated just for their differences."
5,Good and Creepy,"I have to admit, after the October 31st episode aired, I was afraid they were throwing yet another horror story cliche at me (zombies) to go with demonic possession, aliens, psychotic killer, creepy mad scientist/doctor, creepy nun, etc. and I threw my hands up and decided zombies were the last straw (I have no interest in the zombie genre). But friends told me to come back into the fold, that the poor creatures in the woods surrounding the asylum were not, in fact, zombies, but something... different. So, I got on Amazon last week and watched all the episodes I had missed since October 31st. What can I say... I am enjoying the craziness, the eeriness, the edge-of-my-seat, sitting-and-watching-through-my-fingers nervousness, and I am sympathizing with characters and cringing at others, and hoping some get their comeuppance - I'm in for the long haul. I am enjoying it as much as I did the first season. Bring it on, AHS, I'll be watching. Scared and squirmy, but watching."
5,American Horror Story - Season 2,This series ROCKS! I like it even better than the first season.. (The first season rocks too)Brilliant performances by all. (Isn't Ian McShane the best Santa ever?)
3,"Ok, but not as good as season 1","I liked this season, but didn't get excited over it like I did season one. It's worth the watch, but maybe wait to see if it comes out on Netflix or Prime first."
3,NOT so good,This season is a bit slower. Having hard time with what the story plot is. It just doesn't have the mystery like the first one.
1,didn't work,"The ""watch"" button just sent me to a dead page, then expired before it ever worked. $1.99 and I got absolutely nothing for it"
2,Less is More,"Well, it cleared up the questions I had about the episode I missed...but the whole show is getting TOO WEIRD and TOO GORY. Way too much gratuitous bloodshed and mayhem...particularly the Santa episode. Just hope some NUT JOB doesn't try to copycat..."
2,american horror story 2,"Lacks a story line, not as catchy or as creepy as season one. Jumps around to much to follow, don't like the idea of using the same actors from the first season if the story line isn't the same. It just reminds me of the first season to much by using the same actors."
2,Slow moving series. Not as good as season 1,"The series is frustrating and drags along the foundation storyline while introducing new stories each episode. That's fine, but questions are answered too slowly and character development takes forever and then turns out to be a let down/predictable."
2,"Great Art Direction, Horrible Storyline",This show is ridiculous. The plot is weak and has a number of holes. The acting is poor. The only reason I continue to watch is because I bought the whole season on Amazon. Don't waste your time or your money.
3,James Cromwell is terrifying.,"He is seriously scaring the sh!t out of me. Jessica Lange's performance in this episode is flat out amazing. Watching her play this character is probably the only reason I'll stick around for the rest of the season. I just can't get in to the bloody face, aliens, mutants-in-the-woods, exorcist stuff. Somebody just kill Adam Levine, already. Also, I GET IT RYAN MURPHY, Catholics are bad and you are scared of vaginas."
4,Great Show,This is a very well written and well acted program. Jessica Lange really shines and the show wouldn't work without her.
3,Not as Good as season 1,I do not think this season is as good as the the first season. I hope there will be a third season with more substance to it.
3,Not as good as season1,"Very disappointed that season 2 was not a continuation of season 1. I just liked that story and the characters much better. I haven't finished season 2 yet... 2 episodes to go. However, I don't think it will change how I feel. Great acting in both."
3,Season 1 was better,I really thought there was a lot more character development in season one. I will continue to watch season 2 and I hope the episodes get better. I did see some improvement from the first few episodes.
4,Season 2,Not as good as season one but still pretty good. Jessica Lange is always very good. All the acting is rock solid.
5,The reason I signed up for amazon instant video,This show is the reason I signed up for instant video. I love how I can watch the episodes I got over and over again too. It's great because Netflix only has the first season and Hulu doesn't have it at all so I was able to catch up on the second season on amazon instant video so that I could start watching it live on tv when it airs.
3,Very different from Season 1,"Not what I expected. It is not a continuation of Season 1. Very different story line and takes a few shows to really get in to the plot. Its depressing and hard grit, but the final episode (13) pulls it all together. Great acting, suspencefull for sure. Hope season 3 is better!"
4,Not as good as season 1,American Horror Story Season 2 was good and kept you wanting to see more... I was happy to be able to watch it on Amazon Instant Video. I did not feel this season was as good as the first season.
3,Not as good as season 1,"Still entertaining though, but characters weren't as compelling or sympathetic. Not really scary and often just silly. The devil wasn't very formidable."
4,Just scary enough to keep you guessing...,"After the horrors and suspense of AHS Season 1 I didn't know how they would follow up with season 2. The ghosts of the murder house was an amazing idea....nothing could top that. Except, perhaps an insane asylum....Some of it is cliche (mad doctor doing horrible experiments on the forgotten crazy person, the pious, judgmental nun, etc.), some of it just plain weird (an alien abduction?). There are some familiar faces but the characters are completely different.It's definitely entertaining but not perfect and often times confusing but once a week I can count on shuddering after the one hour creep fest and thank my stars that it's just pretend."
5,Horror 2,"Great, like I'm watching it on tv,great to see those actors from other movies in this venue. Recommend to everyone"
5,Great Show!,"Just finished the first season and moved on to the 2nd. It has nothing to do with the first, but some of the actors/actress's have returned from the first season. This series is refreshing to watch, and i'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys thrillers/horror movies/tv shows."
5,In love,U fell in love with the first season and this second season did not disappoint. Kept you guessing till the end and you really get attached to the characters. Also if you are a huge Evan Peters fan like me his role is this one is amazing and he looks amazing.
4,Ho ho ho,Thats just wrong! You know the difference between that Santa and me? He only comes once a year! Seeing Al Swearinton (sp) in this episode made my day. I knew it was gonna be rough when he showed up.
1,Ridiculous storyline Gory and sick,"I loved season 1 but I sure feel stupid for buying the season pass for season 2. I can't watch it. Big disappointment. They just made it as nasty and gruesome as possible. They didn't take any real time to develop the characters, to build a story with suspense. Just blood and gore. This is just too much. Hate it."
1,"First season was amazing, this one fizzled","The first season was really good. The second season the writers lost their way and went beyond the normal balance between horror, reality and good taste. After seven episodes turned it off and cancelled my subscription."
2,Disgusting,"I was a huge fan of season 1.I Loved all the creepy characters and how they interacted with eachother. It was actually scary.Season 2. I watched 3 episodes and never went back. Unthinkable Rape, and severe torture, along with discusting characters. There is no way that many evil demented people would all work in one place without a caring sole in sight. It is not scary its discusting. I was severely disappointed. While Jessica Lang does a fantastic job of acting. I still could not watch this crap. I will not watch this season. . I love a good horror story but this is just filth. Bring back the creepy scary wonderful characters in season 1."
1,Horrid,"I really enjoyed the first season, it was certainly a bit over the top but the story was creative and the characters interesting. I have barely made it through 1.5 episodes of season 2 and am giving up. This one seems as though it was done by a 12 year old. In your face violence just for violence sake, no character development and a story line that jumps all over the place before it is even established.I don't care for reusing the same actors from the last series in different roles, it is distracting. Over all this season looks to be a juvenile gore fest, a huge disappointment."
4,Not as good a season 1,There was way too may things they tried to cram into a single season that won't continue. That being said I'm excited to see what the next installment will bring
4,Great Show,I like how this show treats each season like a mini-series of different ghost stories. I can't wait for the new episodes and hopefully more seasons to come.
4,first one is better but this is still great!,not as good as the first one..but still awesome and SCARY!! Its like the first one in that its a not really a season ...more of a miniseries..
5,Keeps getting better,"Going into this season I was a skeptic. I loved last season and wondered how a new story line could possibly top it. Whoa! I was definately surprised! This season is every bit as horrorific as last season. I wont spill any secrets but all I keep asking is ""who comes up with this stuff?"" Definately graphic (not for the kidlets)and always shocking, I am left wanting more after each episode. American Horror season 2 has not let me down."
5,Much better than the first season,"I started watching this season just so I could have something playing while I was painting my nails because the first season really didn't impress me much but now I actually look forward to watching this every week. It's still one of those shows you watch but don't tell people you watch because it's a little silly, like Glee or Skins or something but it's still very entertaining, at least for me. If you're into dark thrillers like Dexter or Breaking Bad I definitely recommend you check this out."
5,Excellent! Can't wait to watch more.,"After watching the first series, I am excited to watch series 2. The acting is superb! I love that some of the same actors from the first series are in this series 2. Never expected a totally different story line."
5,Not for everyone,"This is not a show for people who are easily offended or have moral issues with controversial subjects. If that is you I would avoid it. If you aren't then this is a great, well-acted, always engaging hour of adult drama. There is so much crap out there on TV that this stands out. I can't wait to see the rest of the season."
3,Not as good as season 1,"Not as good as season 1, season 1 was addictive from the first chapter, this one seems to be a little slower; and watching some of the same actors from S1 playing different characters it kind of throw you off."
5,"Season 2, American Horror Story online","Enjoy the show and this is a great way to catch up if I miss an episode, go back and re-watch a scene or full episode if I have questions. Like it."
3,A bit of a let down.,"A bit of a letdown. ABSOLUTELY loved the first season. Bummed we can't see full episodes for free through the network. This first episode was all over the place. I suppose it was meant to be teasers of a full story...but it really wasn't that interesting. The actual filming did a lot of the flash scenes that actually detracted from the film, in my opinion. I may purchase episode 2 in hopes of getting hooked ...again. But if not significantly improved, I'm moving on."
5,Top notch show I've never heard of,This show is genuinely scary with a excellent plot and great actor's. Very well written and thought provoking. Every episode slaps you in the face with a viewpoint you have never considered.
3,Not fun to watch anymore,"Last season was creepy, but also a lot of fun to watch and there was always an interest in what would happen next. This season is just kind of full of things that make you very uncomfortable (torture, evil Santa, rape, Nazis). Every week, I'm half excited/half disturbed about watching the next episode.In fact, I was just kind of bothered by the fact that there are probably 5 more episodes to watch this season (13 total).I hope next season returns to more ghostly fun."
3,meh,The irst season was much better. This one was ok. Too gorey & more shock value than a good story.
4,Scary,"Great show, but last season was much more suspenseful. Would recommend to others for viewing. A must see! Jessica Lang is awesome"
3,Very different from Season 1,"I found this season a lot different from season 1, more graphic and gruesome. I really enjoyed season 1 because it wasn't overly graphic."
4,It's Okay,I like it but the first season was way better. There have been so many times that I've lost interest.
5,best show,"This is my favorite show on right now and I cant always watch it during the scheduled tv time, so the tv pass works perfectly for me. I can download and watch the episodes when I have time! Highly recommend!"
5,Horror that isn't horrible!,American Horror Story Season 2 is worth watching and getting it on Amazon Prime at my convenience makes it even better!
5,Outstanding!,"I didn't think anything could top Season 1 or Jessica's portrayal of Constance but I'm enjoying Season 2 even more and Jessica, well what can I say, RULES as Sister Jude."
3,Not bad,Season 1 blew me away... I had high standards and Season 2 was unable to deliver. I enjoyed it but it didn't completely captivate me the way the first season did.
3,Disappointment,You spoiled us with season 1 because it was so good. It had lots of interesting characters and side stories with exciting twists and turns. .I expected more of the same from season 2 but it was a disappointment and more sad than scary. Love that Evan Peters though!
3,Well ...,"Season One had me hooked. Season Two had me creeped out: extremely disturbing storyline. I'm still watching, but hoping for the quality of Season One versus the gruesome violence of Season Two. How much perversion does one tv series need? Jessica Lange still rocks as well as all the other excellent actors. Let's work on the story. PS: Still singing ""The Name Game!"""
2,American horror 2,I really wish the directors would of kept up with the characters and theme of the first house. I was kind of disappointed with season 2 but I'm a sucker for horror and overall the show is entertaining to watch.
3,AHS second season,American Horror Story second season is creepy good. can' t look away but have to keep checking under the bed!
2,Not as good as Series One,Big let down from season one. This year's show is much too over the top with the writers throwing in every horror cliche and then even more cliches. Back to the drawing board for season 3.
5,So good!,"Really liked both season 1 & 2 of American Horror Story. It's like watching a horror movie, but through a TV show. Really like the quirky actors, too. Prefer watching on Amazon because there are no commercials. Enjoy!"
4,OMG!! What a difference a year makes.,"I thought last season started out pretty raw, but was blown away by this season's openers! I like this season, but am equally disturbed by it. Instead of last season's ghost story format, this season is twisted, bizarre, sadistic, and thoroughly enjoyable. But, that's only my opinion. I'm a horror fan from waaaaaay back, and AHS Asylum reminds me of horror novels more than movies. Your imagination plays a huge part in reading a scary story; AHS is imagining for me... and maybe beyond me..."
2,Disappointing but still watching,"The storyline is weak and convoluted but there is enough to keep me watching (barely). Where the first seasons creepy or sexual or creepy sexual imagery felt like it had purpose, this season feels like it just throws them in to fill some gore/sex scene per episode quota."
2,Not as enjoyable as season 1,"This season is leaning too far into the ""torture porn"" category that I had hoped had died out. Not interested in finishing the season as I'm not emotionally invested in a single character. It's just gore for gore's sake, no mystery or suspense."
3,Over the top sex and gore for TV,"Season 1 of this show was really scary and it had ""some"" gore, but it was more a ghost story. Season 2 is over the top with a lot of gore, sex themes, very disturbing. Does it do it's job and scare, Yes... but is it way too much for kids who may be tuning in, Yes. I can't beleive, even on cable, that they can get away with showing this. Back in the day they wouldn't even allow this material to be seen in theatres, it would have been slapped with an X. Now I'm not some old lady with school children writing this review, I've seen almost every horror film out there. It's just too much. More scares, less sex and extreme gore and you may have something even scarier and BETTER. My opinion."
2,Season 2 very different from season 1.,"If you loved the first season of American Horror Story, this may be a disppointment. Season 1 was simple, a great haunted house story. Season 2 is chaotic, has too many story lines (alien abduction, serial killer, nazi style experimentation, satanic possession, catholic nun and priest crimes) and sometimes pushes the limit of good taste. It seems as though the writers gave up quality for quantity and it just didn't hold my attention the way the first season did."
3,Just not my thing,"I LOVED season 1, ghost stories are right up my alley. Season 2 still had all the amazing acting with an unbeatable cast and superb directing. BUT, I don't like alien stuff or zombie stuff. I know the zombie thing wasn't a big part but, I just didn't find this season scary at all. I do like serial killer stuff and watched the whole season because it was entertaining and very well done. But story wise, not my thing. I can't wait until the next season though!!"
3,Unnecessarily weird.,"I am not sure I will be watching next season at this rate. I found some of the storylines and characters to be engaging, but they tended not to work well together. I was hoping for a more moody, gothic horror story, but the sci-fi elements seemed really out of place. I cannot say that I did not enjoy watching it, but it certainly did not have much of a pay-off."
5,Right up my alley!,"I started watching AHS late in the first season and had to play catch up. It completely blew my mind and I thought for sure there's no way they can top season one. Boy was I wrong! Season two is as equally jaw dropping, creepy, weird and awesome as the first season! Completely different story line but the acting is spot on! I love this show and can not wait to see what they come up with for season 3!!"
5,SISYLANATPYRC,"Serious stuff, not for the week!Basic (and classic) stuff is covered throughly and systematically. Book is tough to read and if you are not really interested you will put it back after the 5th page. But if you are a geek like me and like puzzles or if you are into cryptography, this is ""book one"" in your arsenal.Warning for black hatters... this is not useful to break modern, computer based codes. It is a ""fundamentals"" book"
4,An Excellent Start,"A great way to get started in classical cryptology. If you want to go further and learn something about cryptology today, I'd suggest Applied Cryptology by Bruce Schneier, rather than the Konheim book, which is really heavy duty mathematics."
3,A good but dated review,"A good book that reviews methods for pen-and-paper solution of simple substitution and transposition ciphers. Dating from before World War II, the main interest here is historical. Nevertheless, it is quite well written and enjoyable, with many examples to solve (most solutions included, but there are a few unsolved ciphertexts)."
2,Needs a storyline,"This film is competently shot, and although I enjoy surreal, philosophical movies (and I love pinball), I wasn't expecting the entire film to consist of voice-over monologue. There's no narrative here, only the filmmaker's stream of consciousness musings. Perhaps my taste for the avant-garde has atrophied since college, but these days I really need some dialogue and a storyline from what I watch."
1,13-year old schoolboy drivel,"Do you like a movie with no plot, no script and nothing to say?Do you like to watch a metal ball roll around a blue sheet and a beige carpet for an hour?Would you like a brain lobotomy?If so...this is your movie!Everyone else avoid this formless, puerile drivel."
2,Same 'ol same 'ol,"You know, I always support Tyler Perry works, but the House of Payne is just a repeat every season. It's the same stuff, different people (at times). I only buy them now because my kids like watching it. Great entertainment for kids, besides the smart-mouthed Jazmyn. But boring for adults."
3,Tyler Perrys House of Payne3,"First few episodes were brilliant but then it started to wain, but loved the series and I am addicted to all Tyler Perry's work!"
1,A few words from a white man(you black people didnt know we knew what this was huh),"Ok this guy has one movie that grosses 50million dollars(which 45 million of it probably was from atlanta)and he gets 6 more movies and 2 tv shows.WHAT!!!!!.1st that movie sucked.2nd why does every main character in his tv shows look fake, the girl looks like a man before you comment on that, i am not talking about madea the wife on H.O.P and are the 2 fat guys in fat suits.3rd Does he think fat black people are funny?4th why isnt this show on UPN or bet?5th What the hell? but seriously i dont get it ,someone try to explain this to me."
5,Excellent for Preparation and for Reference,"These books are great for preparing for the CCNP exams. They are dense books, a lot of information, they are not written just for passing the exams. I have read them and I passed the exams, but I also use them in my everyday work . I have checked some CCIE books also, and most of the information is in these books, so I think I might use them in the future if I decide to prepare for the CCIE. Highly recommended."
2,A big failure to explain well,"Some reviewers claimed it's a good book (in fact 4 books in a set). However, while its technical contents are accurate and in-depth, it fails to help readers to understand the topics so that people can one day pass the CCNP exam.The wording, organization are just odd. They're hard to read, and boring. If you can only last for merely 10 min. on these books, what is the purpose of buying them ?Those authors must be good engineers/instructors, but the editors failed big time to make these books good enough to justify the price tag.My 2 cents, buy some other CCNP books. They're better ones."
4,Soap Opera on a Boat,"I call this a soap opera on a boat....but I love it ( and don't like soap operas)! The cast is wonderful...the intrigue unending...the characters are colorful...and the story is a mind bender. All in all...the ""over the top"" performances actually work very well ( they are all Hollywood people after all). It's a fun movie that you can watch numerous times and still get a kick out of it!"
3,Bad Disc Scenario,"The only problem I'm having with this disc, is that my DVD player when I first put it in says Bad Disc, and I have to open and close the disc drawer to get it to play. It takes about 3-4 times of opening and closing before it plays. I don't have this problem with any other DVDs, that I have, so this leads me to believe that there is something wrong with the disc."
4,Tjhe Last of Sheila,"The movie was of excellent quality, had a good storyline and was riveting. I've alreadt watched it three times. No complaints."
4,Maybe someone can explain this to me,Possible spoiler--Why was James Mason under the S and Richard Benjamin under the A in the photo?
2,Poor Man's Agatha Christie,"Boy, am I ever out of step with the majority of your reviewers on this one. I would agree that the basic premise is a good one, similar to Ten Little Indians and such game-playing, cat-and-mouse type mysteries. However, this one is badly miscast and rather idiotic in parts. Richard Benjamin is a very appealing comedian and even can do a serious part now and then but he's really not the man for this role. Raquel Welsh is totally out of her league, Joan Hackett is wasted and I hardly know what Ian McShane (one of my current favorites) is even doing in this dog. Coburn and Mason are the only semi-bright lights in this, as befits their position as long-time pros. I found the elaborate plot so convoluted as to end up being silly and boring--and very talky. My advice: leave this to admirers of the 70's and watch Evil Under the Sun or some other well-done Christie mystery."
2,I've had considerable problems,"i purchased this item for use with an ipod 4G and my 2000 Nissan Xterra. when the ipod was on full volume, i had considerable static and degradation in sound quality. the bass was barely coming through.i got rid of the static and managed to improve quality by placing the ipod volume at half. even so, it did a far inferior job than my panasonic cassette adapter, which i got with a CD player in the 1980s!the cord of my panasonic is somewhat damaged, but i decided to stick with it and return the jensen."
5,Excellent product,"Excellent product, very good sound quality. Now I can listen to my iPod in my car with a cassette player. Definitely recommended."
3,"Good sound, ok price, lasted about 1.5 years",Bought this adapter in July 2008 and it lasted until November 2009. I think the sound was fine and I didn't have any issues with it at all until recently. I think some of the wires broke down because it just doesn't connect to my ipod anymore.I'm buying a new one now.
2,Nothing special,"Would anyone pay attention to this record if she didn't play violin for Springsteen? I don't think so. There is just nothing special about her music. The supporting musicians make it worthwhile, but after you get past the first two songs (the two that feature Springsteen), it all blurs together."
4,Great voice - great performances!,"I heard part of this album and an interview with Angela on a syndicated radio show called ""Blues Deluxe"". I was impressed with her musical background and the lovely sounds I heard on this new CD. I finally got my own copy and love every song! Thanks, Angela."
3,Sweet but slow with heavy strings.,"To me the strings are not accompanying the voice of Joni James as much as they are competing with it. She has a beautiful voice but for my taste the strings over power it at times. Secondly, the tempo is much too slow, again for my taste. This hides the spirit or joy that so many of these songs possess. The one exception is Ave Maria which is beautifully done.I'm sure that others might rate this collection higher for the reasons that I rated it lower, but I've heard each of these songs many times over and the tempo is not in the manner that I've become accustomed to. I bought this CD primaily for the It Is No Secret tune, and the vitality of the original is really missing."
1,Horribly boring!!!!!,"I am stunned by all of the wonderful reviews for this book. I thought it was by far, the worst book I have read since high school. It could not have moved any slower. The thing I did like about it was the ending and things turn around to get you. Just so much of it was completely out of left field. Boring! Boring! Boring!"
5,"Tense, harsh, twisted, powerful","This is an incredibly well crafted novel. A brilliant, complex tale of complicated, twisted but plausible characters, fraught with tension. Savage masterfully employs foreshadowing and understatement throughout the novel; it clearly requires a re-reading to appreciate them all, as well as its many metaphors. This tale is so powerful that in the first read you are compelled to proceed reading rather than to slowly savor it. After having finished it, I found myself repeatedly rereading the impeccable last 15 pages -- the perfection of the novel's end literally takes your breath away.It is rare that one comes across a novel as well written as this: impressive, satisfying, masterful."
5,The Power of Tom Savage,"I read this novel when it first appeared and thought it was a work of art then. Some thirty-four years worth of reading and teaching literature since has not changed my opinion: This is a beautifully wrought study of the effects that unregenerate evil can have on passive, powerless good. Told from the perspective of most of its major characters, the novel doesn't lecture, but lets events play out in the cattle-ranching west of the 20's to their shocking, wickedly satisfying, conclusion. As I did thirty-four years ago, I'll be pressing this copy of Savage's powerful novel on everyone I know who loves a finely crafted story by a masterful writer."
5,A lost treasure rediscovered,"Thomas Savage's ""Power of the Dog"" is a re-discovered treasure of a novel. Like Beryl Markham's ""West With the Night,"" this book slipped into oblivion shortly after publication and never received literary accolades it deserved. When Annie Proulx wrote a new afterward for the book, contemporary readers took notice and Thomas Savage receives renewed recognition as an important American writer.""The Power of the Dog,"" first published in 1967, contains seeds of a writing style that bears fruit in writers like Thomas McGuane, Annie Proulx, Jim Harrison and Mark Spragg.While the book is a ""western"" in setting, it broaches misogyny, misogamy and homosexuality, subjects seldom touched in writings about the west.Fascinating, darkly suspenseful and wholly satisfying."
5,Outstanding,"Brings back A lot of Memories , for me personally , and regarding the Actors of the Movie this Song, Video played A part in."
1,Jackass Jimmy exposed,"This book exposes Carter for the man he is--a naive, idiotic moron. Instead of writing books and commenting on foreign policy on TV, Carter should be shucking goobers and guzzling Billy Beer down in Georgia. We ALL would be better off!"
1,0 stars were not an option,"Jimmy Carter was his own President. He practices what he preaches, even if its not to my or other folks liking. He is not a Christian-when-it's-convenient false prophet like Bush, and we was not a corporate puppet like reagan, and not a corporate whore like Bush. The middle east crises beagan in the 1940's, as any student with a 2.0 grade average can tell you. The gas crisis may have come to its fruition under Carter, but US foreign policies that began much earlier had the most to do with it. I do applaud the publication of this book as it is yet another example of how the ""Right"" is attempting to re-write history. Maybe Lynne Cheney was the ghost-writer,"
1,this is ridiculous.,"Alright, this is completely ridiculous. Calling Jimmy Carter our ""worst ex-president"" is so far off base, I don't even know where to start. How can you say Carter was the worst when there were people like Reagan, running up our national debt hugely to build unrealistic ""star wars"" defense initiatives? Not to mention Reagan cruelly cut back funding for environmental causes, while Carter worked to protect our earth, as anybody with half a brain should (do you know anything about what a dire state our planet is in?). But this isn't about the environment. It's about the fact that this book should never have even been published. Do not buy it."
1,methinks I smell a personal agenda here ...,"This type of unproductive political diatribe fits in well with the current Rovian political climate .... I don't think that the prestigious Nobel Committee is going to waste their award on someone as inept as described in this book ... the positions put forth in this book are indicative of the challenges we face as a society ... are we going to let the haters take the reins or are we going to move forward as a nation of leaders in positive thought and action? ... in the words of Edward R. Murrow: ""Good Night and Good Luck"" ..."
1,Glaring errors and lies,"I will not waste my energy not one moment more than needed. As a request to a friend, I read his copy.There are so many factual errors and misrepresentations, you could almost laugh out loud except that this is the nature of the lazy writer today.A cheap, empty shot written by an ignorant fool. Even referenced materials are taken out of context. If you have access to a copy. check for yourself. It proves me right."
1,Right-wing hate mongering.,"More junk from the radical right wing. Not worth the paper it's printed on. Try researching the man's life on your own instead of reading from a biased and untrustworthy source. While you're at it, turn off Fox News and start using your brain for the betterment of humanity."
1,Great fiction,"This book is a work of fiction and slander, now available for just $2.95. If you truly wish to see what this great ex-president is about, go to cartercenter.org. Don't forget to read his new book available on Amazon: Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis. Where have all the honest people gone ? It's time to vote them back into office."
1,Disgusting,"This is one of the most blatant pack of slanderous lies I have ever seen turned out by the right-wing propaganda machine. The ""Pharisees"" are back and gunning for everyone that doesn't agree with their elitist agendas. Don't waste your time or effort reading this filth. If you want to truly understand our country's current state of affairs, spend your time reading Jimmy Carter's new book. The truth will set you free."
1,Go Away!,Puke. Go Away!!! THE Worst EX-president (doesn't deserve a capital P.) in our history. Have the class to shut up and go away...take bubba with you!
1,misrepresentation of facts,This book does not give any type of balance to the topic. It gives facts out of context and some complete misrepresentations. If one does not want to think critically yet find someone to blame for world issues (although checking the facts does make one question the validity of placing the blame on Carter) this might be the book for you.
1,Speaking of awful and inaccurate,This book is in one word biased. I personally do not like to often talk about politics and agenda's but when someone speaks so boldly about a good Christian man in such a ignorant and uninformed way I find it appaling. This book is an account of an inaccurate view of a good man. I found this book misleading and with unsupported allegations. NOT WORTH YOUR TIME!!!
1,"A good case for a ""0 stars"" option","Total crap. This is nothing more than an unjust, unwarranted, mean-spirited and factually inaccurate attack on one of the most decent men ever to serve as President. Hayward is a reactionary hack and errand boy for the ultra right wing of American politics. He twists and rewrites history, especially that of the middle east, to suit his ends and completely ignores facts that disprove his thesis. Jimmy Carter wasn't a perfect President but his post presidency has been a model of service to our country and the world. This is a shameful book, unworthy of even the most hard core conservative."
1,Hatchet Job On A Great and HONEST President,"This book is so sad. The reason historians continue to list Carter higher and higher on lists is unlike recent Republican presidents he was both courageous and honest. This is such a smear job simply look at the honesty and integrity of President Carter and compare it to the presidency of Ronnie Reagan and the Bushies. Carter and America win hands down for his four years of service. Also, fact check this book it is Ann Coulter like filth!"
4,Too much emphasis on his failed presidency...,"The book is a review of Carter's entire political career. It offers good info on pre & post presidency, but the emphasis is on what Carter did as President - which is like shooting fish in a barrel. Although Brinkley's 'The Unfinished Presidency' swoons with admiration for Carter, its detail on Carter's post-presidency unwittingly offers far greater weight to the arrogance and stupidity which characterize Carter. The sheer quantity of detail in Brinkley's book combines with its unabashed admiration of Carter to make it more authoritative in documenting the trouble Carter has caused for Clinton and Bush alike.Hayward's book is preferable only in its documentation of Carter's pre-president record...and, of course, his time as President. However, Hayward's bias against Carter makes one wonder if he is presenting a picture that is worse than it seems - a tough chore with Carter!"
1,"SAD, Very sad","Hateful, Right-Wing nonsense! This book is written with so much venom that it is ALMOST laughable! Very Sad."
1,Shameful,"I'm not a kid, for the recordAll these ""allegations"" are based on a worldview common to the ignorant trash who make me ashamed to be a Republican. Only in the minds of belligerent and hateful beings do Carter's works of kindness towards others constitute undermining foreign policy - if Bush was actually Christian as he claims to be, he would follow Carter's policy of charity and love himself.Carter is merely trying to fight the machine that thrives on the idiots reading this book, that takes YOUR support and uses it to pitch America against the world. Coddling dictators? Our allies China has the worst human rights record on the planet! Saudi Arabia have a more archaic justice system than just about any country in the developed world (including Hussein's Iraq)[...], I pray for us all"
1,Christians should see how evil enters our land,"This is a readable book - if you look past the political hatred, misrepresentation of history and lack of any real analysis. When arguably the most Christian president of the last century, who has done so much for human rights and human compassion, is so maligned, one needs to ask - how can right wing ""Christians"" cling to the kind of radical political slag this book provides?I would recommend this book for university students studying ethics, hate crimes or propaganda in the modern world. I won't be giving a copy to my grandchildren - or anyone else I love."
1,Right Wing Propaganda and Spin,Jimmy Carter was the only creative President who took bold steps to correct America's foreign policy. This book is nothing but silly propaganda.
1,Don't Even Bother,"I picked up this book the other day prior to a weekend gateaway. I haven't read such an uninformed, unabashadely partial, and I must admit, rather irreverent book. Don't waste your money."
1,Propoganda is supposed to be free,"This is not history, it is just rhetoric ranting. These right wingers think if they can convince themselves of lies then the lies become true. We all know about the liberal bias of reality. I didn't read the whole book, I didn't even read the whole title. Is it long enough?"
1,"If only left-wingers had ""enemies lists""","If you voted for Reagan or either of the 2 Bushes you will like this book. And if you voted for any of those 3 men please leave my country, never to return."
1,Great Spelling.,"Is all you can say for this. Spell check worked. Other than that? Save your money. No original thinking went into this book. No new information about President Carter is brought forward. Read a thinking conservative's book- if you can find one these days, as publishers seem to be wedded to polemics.This book is preaching to an already converted audience, so nothing you haven't already heard on talk-radio appears here. Come to think of it, read the inside flap, and you have 99% of the book. Whatever happened to reasonable, readable conservatives? Must we all bow at Reagan's Alter? Where are my *thinking* Republicans I am so proud of?"
1,Written for flying monkeys everywhere,"After enduring 8 years of the corrupt Reagan, (The Great Sonambulator), administration, four years of the failed Poppy Bush (well, yes, he's my kid and we had to find something for him to do) regime, after nearly four years of Mr. Bunnypant's pretending to be president, (Saddam tried ta' kill mah Daddy)...after all the screw ups, foul ups, corruption and general lack of ethics on the part of the Repubican party, this is the best the right wing can do? Geez, Hayward, you're looking in the wrong spot...the mess is over there...on the right."
1,Totally misrepresents itself,"The title of this book doesn't tell it's real focus: it's essentially about the Carter administration. If I'd wanted a book about that, I'd have purchased one that was fair and more balanced than this ideologically slanted piece. The title suggests that the book covers Carter as an ex-president, which is poorly covered and very uncovincingly argued."
1,The Real Worst Ex President Can Claim Title in 2008,"I always find diatribes against Jimmy Carter to be especially amusing, since a)no president is perfect, and anyone who expects one to be is deluded and b)Jimmy Carter has achieved far more good in his lifetime than any of his howling partisan critics ever will. This book is useful in that it illustrates just how preposterous Neo-Cons can be in trying to smear someone who disagrees with them. I look forward to reading Hayward's book about how the Real W was the best president ever... that should be a real side splitter!"
1,Far too biased,"Here is a book with a Republican agenda. As such, while there are many interesting stories about Carter the overall tone is one of extreme bias."
1,Please...,"You've got to be kidding me. I'm supposed to believe that all appearances are upside down, and that Carter has malevolent intentions towards democracy and the United States? I don't think Carter was a great President; he was too indecisive. But the arguments in this book are highly dubious. Give me something I can take seriously. If you are interested in a fantasy-land polemical, dig in, for those of you interested in the truth, do your research somewhere else."
3,"The author's heart is in the right place, it is that this book doesn't stick so well","I hate Jimmy Carter. I despise him for helping the Iranian Mullahs overthrow the western government of the Shah in 1979. I want President Carter to be tried in a fair court for his crimes against humanity. For his ties with bad people and awful things he has done since 1978. BUT I've to say this book is not factual, at least when it comes to Iran. Names are pronounced/written mistakenly. Dates and locations of events are wrong and there were errors I couldn't ignore so I decided to write this review. I am pretty sure the author's heart is in the right place and like him and other sane Conservatives, I don't like Carter and likes of him in the DemoNRatic party. This book is not what I really imagined it to be. I wish I could only give it 2.5 stars out of 5 but what the heck, there is no option like that. So I give it 3 stars."
1,Anything for a Buck,"Anything for a buck. Like one of those ""unauthorized biographies"" written by some anonymous Enquirer writer, this book uses a hateful slant to paint an ugly portrait of a good man. Not worth the paper it's printed on."
1,More hate and lies,"This book is so full of lies and hate, Jimmy Carter has done more for people of this country and planet than the last 5 republican presidents combined. Yes this book will be bought by the growing hate mongers of the conservative republican party( those that buy Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly's trash) and it was written just for them so that the author could continue making money from that hatred. But its just more recycled nonsense trying to tear down another person who actually cares about people, something the Bush administration knows nothing about."
4,jimmy in a whole new light,"My parents were devout democrats. But when Jimmy Carter's four years were finally up even they were releived. The traditional view of Carter is that he was/is a good man who was in over his head but meant well. This book puts an entirely different spin on Jimmy. Steven Hayward alleges and pretty much wins his argument that Jimmy is less of a fool than we thought. His decision to meddle in the affairs of every president to come after him shows a man who has a pretty good idea of what he's doing and has a petty sourness that will surprise a lot of people.It's an entertaining, shocking and convincing book."
5,Beautiful,"Funny, how we love to critize the great ones, and God, was Mstislav Rostropovich a great one! His passing has left me depressed and listening to all my recordings of his work. This particular CD has become one of my repeatedly, played favorites. The Prokofiev ""Sinfonia Concertante"" is pure magic, the Miaskovky ""Cello Concerto"" is beautifully enchanting and the Rachmaninov ""Vocalise"" bonus is sublime. A steal for the price."
3,Not bad,"These vitamins have a great smell, but I hated the taste. I drank lots of water to keep from having a bad aftertaste while taking them. I also hated having to take 4 tablets a day...However, they were very easy on the stomach (as promised). All around, not a bad product for the price."
5,"If you need energy during your pregnancy, buy these!","These prenatal vitamins are a must. I cannot get through the day without them. Not only are they a rich source of vitamins and minerals, but they also have some herbs that are helpful for your pregnancy."
2,"Horrible smell, require taking 4 big pills a day","I do not like these vitamins at all and will never buy them again.1) The smell/taste is horrible. I have taken different prenatals in 6 different pregnancies, as well as other supplements over the years. These have the worst smell of any pill I've ever taken, hands down.2) You have to take 4 a day. So, the bottle is more expensive than you think, and you have to take 2 monster pills twice a day. This is because the manufacturers are trying to jam in a whole range of nutrients, beyond the big key ones. In comparing these to my new prenatal vitamins, the new ones require taking only one a day and have as much or more of most of the key nutrients of 4 of the Completia pills.Pesonally, I wouldn't recommend this vitamin to anyone. Even if you want all the miscellaneous nutrients or supplements, I can't imagine that there isn't another one somewhere that's more pleasant to take"
1,horrid smell,"These smell like plastic and leave an AWFUL taste in your mouth! As soon as you open the bottle, you start gagging from the stench. I thought there was something wrong with them but I see everyone else is complaining about the smell as well. Don't buy these! Ugh!"
2,Really?,These...are...disgusting. The smell is horrid and the taste gags me no matter what I take them with. I'm not even pregnant and can't imagine trying to get them down once I get pregnant. Yuck. Add to that the fact that you have to take 4 of these monster pills a day? You'd be better off finding something else. I thought these were a bargain until I realized I was paying 15 dollars for a 60 day supply. No thanks.
4,Great product and very quick shipping,These vitamins are easy to digest and are made of products that I feel comfortable taking for me and my baby. There was a period of time that I ran out of these vitamins and noticed a difference when I began taking them again. I'll be using these vitamins for all my pregnancies and while I breastfeed.
5,A Great Read,This is one of the best books on theology and the disabled that I have ever read. As a student preparing for the ordained ministry I would recommend this book to all seminarians and pastors. It is time that the church rethink it's response to the disabled. Nancy Eisland does this wonderfully when she reminds us of the wounds of Christ.
2,Over Rated,"Emmett Miller's music is quite over rated these days. Miller's ""yodelled"" vocals where a big influence on Hank Williams but so what? Excellent jazz musicians play these records but you can find these same musicians on hundreds records of artists worthier of renewed attention such as Cliff Edwards and Annette Hanshaw."
3,Live at Billy Bob's,"I liked this because I very much like Willie Nelson. However, at times some of the songs seemed to 'drag'."
1,Worthless software,"How does swill like this ever find its way onto the store shelves? I couldn't even figure out a way to save the name-address-tel# data that gets written onto each card. There are no templates for Avery stock, just an inscrutable tool to adjust the printed edges in fifty mind-bending steps that were not explained. All other GUI features are just as poorly thought out, assuming the word ""thought"" even applies here. I bought the product because it was just $10, but it would have been a very poor value even for $2. Office Max wouldn't take it back, so I guess I'm stuck with it."
1,Not a great program,"We started a small business and I thought this program would save us some money by allowing us to print our own business cards. However, there is no instruction book with the program and this program is very difficult to navigate even for an advanced user. Would not recommend."
4,So Cuddly!,"This book is how I fell in love with Animal Ark. ""Bunnies in the Bathroom"" was the first one I ever read and I've continued reading the series throughout the years. I recently re-read the book... still love it just as much."
2,Game Boy Advance Starter Kit,"Package was not like the picture, there is no clear holder for the gameboy advance as in the advert. Everything else was as advertised except the package had been opened previously. By the way this package was not a game so how am I supposed to answer the misworded question?"
4,poirot loses a client,"Hercole Poirot's wit is in fine form in this well plotted and over looked mystery that not many of Agatha Christie's fans may know about. All the characters are well drawn and even a fox terrier is given a supporting role. In fact, the book is dedicated to a dog. One of Christie's longer stories, I really think this one deserves to be back in circulation. Nicely structured and the typical surprise ending is here... one that is sadly moving, too."
4,"Um, wow?","An old maid finds herself thinking that one of her relatives are trying to murder her after she takes a fall down the stairs. Her family says she tripped on her dog's ball, but she knows better. She contacts Poirot,too late. By the time the letter reaches him, she is dead. People says she dided of natural causes, but Poirot wont hear of it. A very great book!"
3,Small physical book and font sizes,"Although this book arrived well packaged and on time, I was disappointed with the smaller physical book size and subsquently, its font size. Despite the posted used price (~ $3,75 plus shipping), I was not anticipating less than the full book size and associated larger font. I will cautious in using this supplier in the future."
3,I never read her books,I liked her father! I don't care for her books but my daughter-in-law does and I bought it as a gift for her.
4,A good mystery with reservations,"I've a fairly large collection of Margaret Truman's Capital Crimes series and I always enjoy them for the insights she gives to the trappings of Washington. Mac and Annabel Smith are my favorites among her characters. I found Murder at the Opera to be an entertaining novel and encouraged me to actually go to a performance of Tosca which I thoroughly enjoyed!That being said... the one criticism that I would have for ALL of Ms. Truman's books is her annoying insistence on using them to further her liberal propaganda. All of her books, and this one especially, frequently go out of their way to include snide remarks about Republicans. Frankly, if conservatives were nearly as thin-skinned as many Liberals, she would've been far less successful as an author!"
3,Average story nothing spectacular!!!!,I have had so many friends rave about Margaret Truman as an author so looked forward to listening to this book on audio. I felt it was very average. It picked up pace about 3/4 of the way through. I don't mind knowing who one of the bad guys is from nearly the beginning that didn't bother me.I since then have listened to MURDER AT THE WASHINGTON TRIBUNE by Margaret Truman and it is far superior. If I were you skip this one and go for the other one. It is fast pace and fascinating. I'd love to give that book a 4 and 1/2 star compared to a 3 star with this one.
1,horrible customer service,"Although, the stereo was nice when working, it broke down after about 7 months. It has been sitting in the service center for five months with no action taken. I have called the service center five times and have called panasonic three times with no other action being taken. So not only am I out the stereo, but I also lost the five CD's that were loaded in the stereo as well. This qualifies as the worst customer service I have ever experienced!"
5,Cute decor piece,"Thin metal floppy type sign but super cute design. The old or distressed look is all in the painting. There's no lifting of paint when you run your fingers over the edges. All smooth look, brand new feel."
5,A great game,"I am tired of hearing about how hard it is to pass on NCAA 2005, it's not supposed to be easy to pass. I average about 200-250 passing yards a game and i don't even have that good of a quarter back. so stop complaining because this is a great football game"
3,Realistically,"If my reciever drops another pass I'm going to break this CD in two. On average your recievers will simply drop about 5 to 7 passes a game, even at home, where supposively your players are not as likely to get rattled. Don't get me wrong I like the new features but theres still no excuse for anyone to drop that many passes, especially a senior reciever. I like the running alot more on this game, it seems like you're able to *see* the holes better, and an offense with speed really does dominate on this game. It seems a little too easy to be dominate on defense though, if you play the run heavy with an extra linebacker in zone coverage, basically a 4-3 against 3 wide out sets, and then going dime on 3rd and long, it'll be easy to have the 1st rated defense in the country in both pass and run. Also recruiting is just as easy as last year, on my first year I got 6 bluechippers, while no one else even had 3. A good game, but not a great game."
1,DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!,The graphics are horrible.Sound effects stink.Recievers always drop passes.Controls dont work half the time.A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!
1,Won't work must be used,This game won't work I was really disappointed because that was my sons big surprise for Christmas and it was a bust
4,Fun game!!! Very cool...,"I personally love NCAA 2005 for the X-box game console. This game is fun, and has very simple controlls.We all hate a game that you don't know the controlls to. This game basically gives you the controlls while your playing...Snap the ball, and then it brings up the button you want to press to throw to each reciever.Personally, I think this game is about the same thing as madder 2004 (which is a good thing)buy this game, its a must have party or just time passer game."
2,Bad game,"This is one of the worst football games i ever played. I am so glad this game came with the Xbox. For one thing if you want to start a season on it, it is very confusing. It also takes forever to find the team that you want. It is very confusing to see wear your passing the ball. It is also very hard to to see who has possesion of the ball during the running plays. If you can't read football plays, you'll have a hard time playing this game. It took me a while to get used to reading the plays. My advice is, when you get the Xbox, sell the game on ebay. Remember the title of this review, Bad Game."
3,I CANT PASS THE BLEEPING BALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this game, online play is great. My only complaint is I cannot pass the stinking ball. Which does not bother me too much, since I tend to run a ton of option. But boy does it make me mad when a 94 rated reciever drops a 10 yd slant w/ no one on him. This happens a lot, too much, almost unplayable if I'm online and the other dude can stop the option. But other than that its a great game. Of course, this can be a huge problem and has cost me one controller already (got so po'ed I jumped up and down on one)"
4,Awesome Violin Jazz,"To my initial disappointment Live in New York did not have the same feel to it that In Full Swing had--partly because In Full Swing was recorded in a studio, and partly because the song selections have a different underlying feel. But it is still a great cd.One of the songs, Anniversary, runs on and on and I usually just skip it when I listen.The coolest--and hottest--song in the album is Gypsy Fantastic. I listen to this one enough times to make up for the skipped Anniversary.The rest of the songs are good, though at least two of them are repeats from previous albums.If this is your first time trying O'Connor's Hot Swing Trio, I'd get In Full Swing first; if you have listened to the other cd and like it, you will probably like this one too. Just don't expect a lot more of exactly the same stuff."
4,"Fun, but kind of cheaply made","My boys are 3.5 years and 18 months. They love these puzzles and never get tired of them. My only complaint is that they are rather cheaply made. The paper peels up and I've had to glue it down on the actual puzzle board as well as the puzzle pieces themselves. Other than that, they take a lot of wear and tear and have held up OK so far."
3,Basic puzzle,Puzzle pieces are basic and a little on the thin side. We had to repair one piece within a few weeks becasue the ply-board had separated (easy fix with a little glue). The names of the items are printed under the puzzle piece which lends this toy to a slighly older baby.
4,very happy with this purchase,"I purchased these puzzles for my grandson's 2nd birthday. While its true there's no picture under the pieces I am still very happy with this purchase. They're good size puzzles, very sturdy and simple enough for even a small child to do. They even have little knobs to to hold while putting the pieces in. At $5 each for wood puzzles you just can't go wrong."
5,Puzzles,My son enjoyed this toy he learned most of the animal& vehicles. This is great for re-enforcing what your teaching them at a young age to identify object to the real world items.
3,Nice-looking puzzles but a bit disappointing,"I was excited to find puzzles with a good number of pieces since my daughter can put most puzzles together without a problem. I was disappointed that some of the words used under the puzzle pieces were British (lorry instead of truck), some words were hyphenated when they shouldn't be (ice-cream), or two words instead of one (water melon). This isn't a big deal for my daughter but unacceptable for her mother the teacher. Also, one of the knobs was missing upon its arrival. Be careful of this with young children-recommended age is 3+."
5,Must have for Pokemon Fan,"My daughter loves this movie. As she says ""It is a must have for any Pokemon fan."""
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!,"OMG!!!!!! Pokemon movies just keep getting better every year!!!! I mean this one the graphics,the characters,and the story line it was just amazing all around and you people have to watch it and buy it because it is the best Pokemon movie up to date by about only 1/10 of a percent!!!!!!!!but still AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Why do I keep buying these?,"I love Pokemon! I have every single movie released on DVD. But I was way too old when Pokemon first came out (1998, I think?), and I'm definitely way too old now. But I can't help myself from buying these DVDs whenever they are released in the US. And it's not like the stories are any good, and I haven't played the games in years. But something about them makes me buy them every time they come out. Maybe it's because I already have them all and I just want to keep the collection going. It certainly can't be the story line. ""Pokemon is distressed. Ash saves the world. Pika pika!"" But as the Pokemon keep getting more and more ridiculous and more powerful and uglier, the characters keep getting more blah. I know this is a children's movie, but still, there can be a better storyline.By the way, anyone know when the next one comes out?"
2,Cute but cheap,"This is a cute charm but the body snapped off after two days of wearing it. Works without the body (wow, that sounds weird) but it was a bummer that it broke."
5,We miss you Randy,"What a great collection of rare material from the archives of Randy California!!! This is a treasure trove of material from Randy's solo career, as well as some live Spirit recordings from the same time frame. Randy was a very talented individual, and these recordings prove it! This collection was lovingly assembled, and preserved for us fans by Mick Skidmore. The packaging may seem a bit sparse, but the liner notes are good, and the music is recorded surprisingly well. I am very glad I picked up this collection from Amazon. This is an amazing 4+ hour collection for very little money!"
2,Disappointing,"I came to Edwyn Collins via ""Girl Like You"", but I really liked the rest ofGorgeous George. I was less enthralled with the followupI'm Not Following You, but still hopeful.Collins has a good voice, intelligent lyrics, and an interesting singing style. Unfortunately, Doctor Syntax mostly doesn't make use of those strengths. The first half of the album is forgettable, meandering, and somewhat pointless. It's only in the last few songs (starting with Johnny Teardrop) that the album begins to pick up. 20 Years Too Late and It's a Funny Thing might have been good middle of the road songs on a stronger album, but here they're just too weak to hold up the entire album on their own."
4,blows Bose out of the water!,"Very competent sound for the size and low power output (35wpc on paper but probably closer to 20-25w in reality). Each speaker weighs in at about 10 lbs which would normally be a very respectable weight until you figure in that they have built=in amps. The independent bass and treble controls are a great feature.I'd compare listening to these to be like listening to a high quality boombox, except that with the ability to place the speakers a lot farther apart you'll enjoy better stereo separation and also less distortion at high volumes.However for two hundred fifty dollars you could also pick up a cheap Sherwood receiver and a cheap pair of small speakers like the Polk R15 which would still sound better, just look at the jr dot com website.The main plus of these Advents though is that they are compact and portable (AC/DC operation)...otherwise for home PC listening I'd still recommend the Logitech Z-2300 2.1 system with subwoofer for just above a hundred bucks."
5,Advent AV570 Still Going Stong,"I love these speakers. After 15 years of use, these Advent AV570 are still going strong.These speakers blows Bose out of the water. It is amazing how much bass can come out of these small speakers."
4,Vizsla Knowledge,"Vizslas are great dogs, but they have some unique characteristics, that you need to know about before owning one. I would highly recommend this to anyone considering buying a Vizsla or a new owner. I have made notes and noted page numbers and have referred to them often."
5,The Versatile Vizsla,This book was highly recommended to me by a Vizsla dog breeder as the authority on raising and training your Vizsla. After reading the book I have to agree that this is an excellent book. It covers all aspects of the breed from birth to death. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in buying this lovely breed of dog or to anyone who is currently the owner of a Vizsla.
3,Review,"Decent book on the Vizsla breed. Nothing too detailed, but a good overview of the breed and general care. If you're planning on getting a Vizsla, it's probably worth the investment to read this book."
5,Total book on the breed,I am fortunate enough to have a puppy from the author. What a wonderful person and breederThis book is my Vizsla bible
4,Very informative,"This book was right on target with my new Vizsla puppy. It has tons of information, including breed history, AKC standard, growth guidelines, etc. I gave this book 4 stars because it included pictures, but they weren't in color. I feel that for the price, they could've included a few color pictures. This book really sums up the breed very well. I would recommend it to any new Vizsla owner!"
5,Versatile Vizsla,"Love the book, since I own and have owned a versatile Vizsla - the best dog in the world!"
1,Product Description wrong,This item came up when I searched for WIRELESS speakers. They are not. I have to pay to have them shipped back now.....
4,"Jensen J052W Indoor / Outdoor 2-Way Speakers, White",good outdoor speakers for the money. can be mounted vertically or horizontally. sound quality is good. yet to see how the hold up to south florida weather
4,jensen speakers,These speakers are just right for the application I'm using them for. They sound good and were easy to install.
4,Big Things Come in Small Packages,These speakers are pretty good. I was plesantly surprised when I cranked up the volume and they performed well. They produce tons of bass and the high frequecies are clear. Also they are really durable.
1,NOT WIRELESS,The speakers come up when you browse for wireless speakers. We bought them thinking they were wireless and they are not. We plan to return them. The info regarding these needs to be much clearer.
3,"OK, but go look for something else...","These are nice speakers if you can get them cheap. However, they do not sound very good; they do not even have a crossover! The sound is a bit metallic, and not very clear. They are rated to produce 35Hz-25KHz but the lower limit is probably more like 55Hz. Don't expect their power handling to be the rated 300W, 70-90W will probably fry them. I would suggest to get Sony SSM-F300H, these can be found cheaper , yet the sound is a bit better."
3,Jensen J052W Indoor / Outdoor 2-Way Speakers,"I chose these speakers for the decent reviews and the good price. The included mounting brackets are nice,easy to install and very adjustable, and don't seem to come with all of the outdoor speakers. That made a big difference in my choice. Unfortunately, these speakers have a hollow, deep sound that provides enough bass, but doesn't balance to make audio audible outdoors. If it weren't too much effort to dismount these and return them, I certainly would."
3,si! its ok.,"Its an ok dictionary, but it does not have a lot of Central American words in it which is a little sad, because that is what I was looking for."
3,Latin-American Spanish Dictionary,"I was disappointed that the book was so old - 1996. It was in good condition, but 15 years old is stretching it a bit, especially a reference book such as a dictionary."
3,Average Product,"Not enough detail for me, possibly could be useful for high school or junior high, but not for college use. Insufficient exploration of idioms for word entries."
4,Good stories,"It's got lighthouses and it's got ghosts, what's not to like about this fun book? Some neat tales of lighthouses, many of which I have visited around the country."
4,Good manual for a beginning Website designer/creator,"The book is well layed-out, and descriptions are clear and concise. The first 95 pages or so are relatively basic. I have used a crusty version of Homesite to create a few basic Websites in-the-past, so those first 95 pages didn't teach me anything that I didn't already know. Except perhaps for the design and paper and pencil preparation.After page 95 (or so), you jump right into Dreamweaver and are instructed as to its' functions. The Webpage you're building is a basic HTML page, and does not use any server-side technology like ASP, or PHP, or CGI/Perl.It too is well layed-out, and step-by-step. I only wished that a deeper discussion of CSS integration was employed.So, for the beginner, or for someone who likes to paper & pencil prep, I'd have to say that this is a worthwhile buy.For the more advanced user, I'd have to say that you may be better off with more of a reference-style tome.All said, I do not regret the purchase."
3,I just want to know what is POD testifying about?,"I thought they were ""Testifying"" about Jesus...LOL...I bought the cd cause after listing ""Strength of my Life"" on Christian radio, I thought they had switched. Only can listen to 2 songs in the cd really which is cool. giving heads up though.POD has gone and has been mainstream always I guess... This is something that is getting very common to see in christian radio, mainstream bands trying to attract other communities by releasing all types of music with christian lyrics.Oh well."
4,About Time for a new P.O.D. Albulm!,"P.O.D. does not disappoint w/ their new album. If you liked Satellite and Payable on Death you will like this one as well. I'm so thankful these guys did not break up.Altho, I do not feel it is as good as Payable on Death (my fav. P.O.D. cd) it's almost up there with it.You will not be disappointed!"
4,Very good but no Satellite,"This album has a little something for everyone. You have the hard rock feel the reggae feel and the strong messages in every song. Best message coming from ""Strength of My Life"". Thats what makes POD great they can rock out hard and deliver a positive message and this album definitely rocks out hard. My top three on this album are: ""Strength of My Life"", ""Mark My Words"" and ""Roots in Stereo"". A definite buy for any POD fan."
3,"POD's sound, worn out with age","POD had earned its place high on the hip-hop/rock charts after the release of their album ""Satellite"" with a high amount of hit singles. Two years after Satellite they released a self-titled album that went no where. Why? Because their sound had been worn out by a slew of other bands trying to get to the top by mooching off of POD's sound. This curse is written all over ""Testify"". A cd- that had its sound not been worn out- could have been excellent. The sad thing is that the guys in POD realize this. The fact that they do is made obvious by the backing raggae vocals that just dont work. They tried to make it something new with those vocals but it only comes out annoying and old. In reality thats the only problem I have with this album, but time has worn their sound out. Their time is gone."
2,What Happened To POD?!?!,"I read a while back that Sonny said the next POD album would be their best. They failed big time.First the good: ""Mistakes & Glories"" and ""Say Hello"" are great songs with an agressive POD sound.Now the bad: The rest of the CD blows. The sound is weak and lame and the reggae music only add to the annoyance of this really bad effort.After their self titled album, they should have just left the music scene. This is just a horrible effort. To me, they sound like they are trying to reach into the pop music scene.I will end with this question: What's the next step in music for them? Probably an acoustic praise and worship CD. Goodbye For Now POD."
3,Not Horrible Not Great,"It's nice to hear Payable On Death back in the music scene, but i really find this album lacking. I gave it a few listens to see if it would grow on me but nothing. It's rather boring and i honestly can't stand the vocals of the backup reggae singer for some reason. However it does have some solid tracks and thus i suggest it to any P.O.D. lover. However, for those who don't know alot about P.O.D. i suggest you get one of their other works my personal favourites being Snuff The Punk & Satellite. All in all though I'm dissapointed that it took P.O.D as long as it did to release a subpar album."
2,A little weak.,"P.O.D. definitely was thinking a bit more ""mainstream."" Not a whole lot of ""heavy"" on this one. I am a big P.O.D fan but this one is probably their worst CD."
3,"Sometimes, I just don't get it","Ok, I like this album, I was getting tired of the same old BS this guys have been feeding their fans for a few years.This one is different, but please, Jedd Beaudoin, you should stick with your progressive rock reviews, because if you know what you're talking about, you wouldn't be reviewing this album.POD looks refreshed, yes, Marcos Curiel was a better guitarist, but the sound they acomplished here, rivals the tight musicianship Curiel showed back in the day. It's a shame they don't get the credit they deserve, but if you're interested in hearing a new P.O.D. sound get this... And you thought you would never see a ""nu metal"" band evolve... But P.O.D. fans know they're beyond labels and genres right?"
5,P.O.D. is back!!!,Long time fans should like this album although it's not as heavy as their earlier stuff. There are some smokin' metal tunes on here (Mistakes and Glories) as well as the rap and reggae elements that they've always done. Sonny's singing is as good as ever. It's an amazing overall album. I just wish the new songs from the Warriors EP were on here too!
3,Stephen's Review,Well I was a little disapointed in this CD. it sounds all the same! the only good song i think is Goodbye for now.
5,Warrior Fan Since 1996,"I first Heard P.O.D. Play in a small club in Little Rock, Arkansas. They were opening up for a band (Living Sacrifice) that played at a local club (Vino's). I had heard this band ""P.O.D."" was opening up for Living Sacrifice. I met Sonny and the band before the show in a freind's apartment.P.O.D. Still one of my favorite bands! Although I miss seeing them play locally since they have become so popular, it has been great seeing their music be heard and enjoyed by so many world wide! Testify is a musical masterpiece. I highly reccomend this album!"
4,It's a thing of beauty...,"But absolutely worthless in a fight.As for being a filter, it's great, air goes in, dirt comes off, no problem."
4,Good Value,"The for price, this was a good value, and fit perfect in my furnace. I plan on purchasing again when I need to replace them."
3,Blank computer...,"Fitment Notes: New Electronic Control Unit, PWRT CONT(w/o CALN)w/o CALN means Powertrain Control Module Without Calibration. Sure it will fit but there is nothing on it."
3,"Love the CD, but...","I love this CD so I'm glad I bought it, but it took foooorrreevveerrr to receive it (>month). Wish I would have known how long it was going to take to get it :("
4,Used for decoration for theme Birthday party,Ordered this to add to decorations for a theme party. Item arrived in time and good condition. Didn't rate the playing with stars due to not used for that purpose.
3,Hamburglar,I bought this as a gift for a coworker. Her nickname is the Hamburglar. She thought it was funny. A kid would probably like it if they knew about the McDonald characters...but they aren't really advertised anymore.
4,Damn near the best album of the year,"This was, without a doubt, my main ""go to"" album of 2006. When I was scrounging for something to listen to and just didn't know what to turn to, when I needed a lift, when I was in a good mood, when I was in a bad mood, whatever the occasion, this album was IT. Rockford delivered every time. Full of exactly what you always hope for in a Cheap Trick outing - incredible hooks, great, catchy songwriting, and Robin Zander's incredible voice. There isn't a flaw on the damned thing. I had a hard time not calling this album of the year, actually."
3,Welcome to Rockford,"Now for a review from someone who isn't a Cheap Trick fanatic.Ever since they've bounced around from label to label, Cheap Trick has not put out the best records, but they make a good recovery with Rockford. The band plays with more conviction in years, even if the material isn't always worthy of it. Robin, Rick, and Bun E. capture the classic sound that made them back in the late 70's with a blend sounds that are Beatle-esque. Some of the songs are memorable like Perfect Stranger and If It Takes A Lifetime even if it sounds strangely close to Tonight It's You. C'mon C'mon is a headbanger that gets to your head. And while CT has been known to write a good ballad, Oh Claire comes up short and oddly forgettable. Still worth giving the CD a listen to. Lord knows with all these hard rock wannabees coming out today, they all should listen to Cheap Trick as the masters still know how to get it (mostly) right."
3,"Cheap Trick`s newest CD - "" Rockford ""","Pleasantly surprised by the cd. Don`t always know what to expect from Cheap Trick.I personally would not have led the cd off with ""welcome to my world"". Didn`t really care for that song. The song ""One more"" would have been a good start to kick off the cd. Overall the cd has some good up beat songs like ""Give it away "" - ""If it takes a lifetime"" - ""Perfect stranger"" - ""Every night and every day"" and the song "" Come on come come"" which I really liked. Overall - the cd was pretty good and worth a listen. Cheap Trick fans will like this cd and probably others who haven`t heard Cheap Trick."
5,Totally underrated,I admit to having a bias in favor of the boys from Rockford but this is really a tremendous effort. Better accolades were deserved.
5,I Love Rockford,"Like with Cheap Trick's self-titled 1997 release, I can not stop listening to this CD!!! There is so much confidence within Rockford and a certain whimsy that comes off as ""Yes this is great and we're not even trying,"" much like the way Heaven Tonight seemed. A few tracks that I especially love are: ""O Claire,"" (very Beatles sounding) ""This Time You Got It,"" (so energetic) ""All Those Years,"" (again, very Beatles-like) and ""Give It Away"" (classic Cheap Trick).I strongly recommend this CD."
3,"Good music, Ok recording quality","Having been a fan of Art, Benny and Chico for many years, I was excited to hear such albums existed and loved that they were put on one CD under Blue Note's Connoisseur series. After carefully hearing the tunes, I was not surprised that I enjoyed all of them and was expecting to hear great arrangements from both arrangers and orchestras. However, I would have enjoyed hearing Benny Golson's recordings cleaned up, there was too much hiss and crackling to the point where it was annoying. The Chico O'Farrill material was good (Fair, luckily my favorite tunes were on the second half. Over all I give it a 3 star."
5,"ONE FAMILY, MANY STYLES!","Yes, I adored The Osmonds when I was a kid and I snapped up every record by the band, and by Marie, Donny and Little Jimmy. The Osmonds (as a band) made snappy pop or even power-pop like Crazy Horses with its great neighing guitars and also had huge hits with One Bad Apple, Yo Yo, Love Me For A Reason and Down By The Lazy River. Marie's country song Paper Roses is a great interpretation while the duets I'm Leaving It All Up To You and It Takes Two aren't bad either. Little Jimmy's contributions include the huge UK hit Long Haired Lover From Liverpool and Tweedle Dee. I swooned over his squeaky voice back then and that was long before Michael Jackson's yelping. But to be serious, this music isn't bad at all (and probably better than today's equivalent) and this album offers great variety. If you grew up in the 1970s you'll enjoy this trip down memory lane."
4,Funny Show... even 30 years later,"Despite the fact the DVD's are two-sided and no extra features, I am pleased to have the first season on DVD. Salute to Bob!"
2,Fox just refuses to give good shows any respect,"Fox continues to disrespect great shows such as ""The Bob Newhart Show"". They will treat ""King of the Hill"" or ""The Simpsons"" akin to ""Gone with the Wind""...but a real quality show such as this is given shabby treatment.The packaging is poor (two slimline cases, with double sided DVD's????), the extras are non-existent (none, nada, nyet!), and the transfers are equal to VHS quality, full of grain and poor focus.But, of course, this show will probably only see one release, so those who appreciate quality entertainment are stuck with what they give us.I can only hope future releases of this show (and MTM) will be treated with greater respect....but I'm not holding my breath."
5,At Last!,"The Bob Newhart Show has been my most eagerly anticipated release since Charmed. I won't comment on the packaging or two-sided disks since others have and I (mostly) agree with them. My 5 stars are for the show--not the packaging.The Bob Newhart Show has been a favorite of mine since it originally aired. This show is as funny today as it was then. I watched all 3 disks this weekend and, once more, laughed out loud. I rarely do that with today's television shows.My favorite episode of all time of any show is Howard holding up the wall--no thanks to Bob and Emily! Puleeeeze, puleeeze release the remaining seasons."
2,"Great episodes, garbage bag package","I love the show and the episodes, but the double-sided discs are absolutely ridiculous! If the m*a*s*h releases can contain 8 episodes on 1 side per disc, why not Bob Newhart? What's with the 2 discs in 1 slim case and 1 in the other? They know we will buy the set anyway, because we want the episodes, but this cheap crappy packaging is really an insult to us consumers. How much are they really saving per set with this cheapness???"
4,Clean and funny,This show has one of my favorite actors (Bob Newhart) and I like the fact that its not dry humor but good clean humor.
3,"okay, not great","They should have tried to digitally remaster these old shows. Some are very ""grainy"" and difficult to see clearly. Enjoyed it but with some reservations about the picture quality."
3,Definitely worth following for a while but this fine sitcom is best taken in small doses,"The reason is because all this neurotic humor between Dr. Bob Newhart could get a little scarey to watch. On other points. Its already been pointed out on here that this show is dated. But that is a plus. Great characters like Bob's attractive housewife neighbor, Margaret, are nice characters we don't see much of anymore."
5,Excellent Show and Smart Packaging,"It's about time that the original Bob Newhart Show arrives on DVD. Bob Newhart and Suzanne Pleshette brighten up the television screen with this classic series. I can only hope all the seasons of this excellent series are produced on DVD.What I like especially about this release is it's affordability. No-nonsense packaging enhanced me to puchase it. Continue producing series similar like the the first and they will be a hit.Fox made a mistake producing the Mary Tyler Show Season One with its elaborate packaging, and expensive price. I've been waiting for season two, three and the rest. C'mon, Fox, get it out!!!!!I can only hope that the original Bob Newhart Show, Mary Tyler Show & Rhoda Series will be made available to the fans of classic television of the 1970's at an affordable price.Make it and we will buy!!"
4,Cast away brotherhood.,"A good companion book to the 20,000 leagues under the sea. Just to show what teamwork and each team's knowledge can do as a group."
2,Review!,"This book starts off pretty good and sucks you in, but about halfway through it feels like it's dragging on and on. I kept waiting for the mysterious part, but all I got was island. I read a summary and it turns out there isn't much mystery after all. Don't bother."
3,interesting,it was interesting to see how they made everything on the island comfortable for themselves. but the ending was not that good
5,a great adventure,"first digital book i've tried and is going well, would love a glossary at times, but is a fun adventure, would love to be able to read it to an entire classroom - imagination and Ingenuity at it's finest. What an imagination Jules Verrne was blessed with!"
5,50 + years ago...,"This book was the very first bookmobile book I bought when I was in the school book club. I loved the story then and I bet a dollar to a donut I will love it again. If my memory serves, I bought this book in 5th grade. That would have been about 1961. I am looking forward to reliving the memories."
2,The Mysterious Island,"It is interesting, but not my choice of reading. It was one of my first books on my Kindle & I was just trying out how to get books."
3,A deserted island survival manual,This novel read more like a short story. Its saving grace was that it was written in 1870. Verne spins a fanciful tale of 5 survivors of a balloon trip of a few thousand miles during the Civil War. They are marooned on a deserted island after traversing half the Pacific ocean. They proceed to overcome every possible obstacle thrust in their way using scientific ingenuity and create a utopia. Outside forces help them along the way which we discover are manufactured by none other than an aged Captain Nemo. Verne's knowledge is very impressive for the time. However the book reads more like a summary of every clever idea Verne conjured up in his mind tied together by a predictable plot.
2,Great to Put you to Sleep,"Maybe I just don't appreciate the classics but it was a struggle to get through this book and I found many parts where I was asking myself ""Really? You want me to believe stranded people with no tools can do that?""I tried it because it was free through the Kindle eBook. I would have been upset if I had paid money for it."
4,"""The Mysterious Island"" is not so mysterious","Mysterious Island by Jules Verne is a classic from a bygone era. The writing style is dated and most consumers of modern literature will say ""huh?"" to themselves as they read it. Be that as it may, the book still stands the test of time, and is entertaining for those who wish to delve into that era. Jules Verne was a master of ""Science Fiction"" in his time, and had a large part in the popular adoption of the genre in literature. I would recommend it just to experience writing from that time period."
3,Interesting,"Not what i expected. yet a very interesting book. i usually don‘t read books from this era, just goes to show they can be of interest."
4,Do NOT use this book as a survival manual...,"Right, now that we have that straightened out...what a book! I write this review with tongue in cheek, just as the author must have written this book. Why? well...Five Union prisoners of war escape Richmond, VA in a Rebel spy balloon, and a mere five days later end up on a remote island in the Pacific. Being very resourceful (not to mention absolute geniuses) they do what anyone stranded on a deserted island would do: they forge their own iron and steel tools, make glass, an elevator, nitroglicerin, and even a telegraph using 100% natural materials (think the professor from Gilligan's Island). But in the course of their struggle against nature, strange incidents convince them that this island may not be as deserted as they thought...(insert ominous music)...Be prepared for a kicker ending that will leave you chocking on your lithodomus!"
5,Mysterious Island,"An excellent read, extremely descriptive. You almost feel as though you are one of the characters. This is the first Novel that I have read by Jules Verne and will not hesitate to read further stories by him,no matter how far fetched they may have seemed when he first penned them.If you enjoy a bit of fantasizing I would have no problems in recommending that you purchase ,sit back and enjoy."
4,Mysterious Island,Quite apart from a cracking good read Mr Verne's extrapolation of the southern hemisphere its flora an fauna gives a vivid insight into how the late 18th century must have viewed the vast unknown. typical Verne a few small leaps of faith and its all very plausible entertaining and capturing for the reader. Highly recommended.
4,Youngatheart,"Vern,s knowledge of chemistry,farming,astrology was unbelievanble and an absolute delight but may be tiring to some readers. This book can be enjoyed by the young and old alike."
1,Are you kidding Amazon??!,"Why would you put the ending of the book in the ""Book Description"" section of the book page?!?! I've wanted to read this book for forever, but what's the point after you tell me the twist at the end of the book!?"
2,Not that great,"Dull and boring from the beginning. Too little talking, and no real entertainment. I was immediately bored with this book."
4,You see nature in all its beauty...,"Interesting reading....Narration is very intimate...More of describing the nature, the plains, hillocks.......You have to read focussed...no speed reading if you want to enjoy..."
3,A bit far-fetched,"I found this book to be a bit boring in that it seemed to take forever for a series of small events to lead up to the final resolution of a larger issue and was disappointed by the largest ""mystery"" that existed on the island. For all the small events and mysterious happenings that took such a long time to describe, the resolution was rather sudden. I also found it to be unlikely that a bunch of ""castaways"" would be able to create explosives, glass plate, a forge, and a variety of other ""modern"" comforts from nothing. I realize these things are theoretically possible to do, but who exactly would have such a range of specific knowledge and the ability to turn it all into actual, working systems? It was not as artfully told as it could have been and I found myself either rolling my eyes or thinking, ""yea,... riiight"" a lot as they created one ""modern"" item after another in short order."
2,TC in Texas,"I was more than a little disappointed in the quality of the book. The jacket was not as shown on Amazon. The hard back cover, paper and printing were very below par. The book looked as if it was made with a zerox machine in need of repair. Some printing on pages has transfered to the other page over writing printing on opposing page, giving the impression that the book was home made on a printer.TC"
4,Mysterious whisper,"This is a fine Victorian era fantasy novel by Jules Verne. Five Civil War era Americans get stranded on a mysterious island. They manage to survive, and even thrive, thanks to their ingenuity (and from some other means that I won't reveal because that would give away the secret behind the mystery). That's all I am going to say about this book, read it yourself and discover what happens. Recommended to fans of 19th Century fiction."
4,A great read.,"Although I certainly enjoyed other, better known works by Verne (Around the World in 80 days, Voyage to the Center of the Earth), this turned out to be my favorite. I appreciate the character detail, the sense of suspense and the detail of the progress our heroes make on the Mysterious Island.I recommend it for any Verne fan."
5,Wow!!!,"What a GREAT READ!!! I have taken time to ingest what I am reading, Jules Vern, is one of the greatest writers ever, now looking for more of his works. Anyone that enjoyed Swiss Family Robinson or other adventure books will truly enjoy this book."
3,find a right version,"This translation version is not very good (perhaps due to the translator who seems lack of knowledge of science). A very good version is translated by Sidney Kravitz, the book includes more original illustrations than this one (simply wonderful), really great, but very expensive. I just got one from Amazon for $25! It looks like it has not been reprinted. The Kindle version is the original old translation version, perhaps done in 1880s."
5,"excellent ""how to survive with nothing but your wits"" book",An incredible story of a group of men who took what their situation gave and stuck it out. An excellent example of Defoeism.
3,Jules Verne,"I love the learning in this book. Jules Verne is very educated and imparts a lot of knowledge in a palatable way. It is also a page turner adventure-wise! It's hard to stop reading. But when I do it's because it does get a bit dry. His literary style is very good, but his characters are dry, there is no ""naturalness about the characters"" in the book for all the nature there is in the story. No one is less than perfect in their character. They are all supermen. They have no relationship issues, no human moments. However, I will likely finish this saga in time."
5,Good,great book and great storyline. Decent book for free. Just a good one for the ages to read and remember
3,"Bad science, good story","After our children saw the latest movie based on Jules Verne's books, we decided to let them read the original. The story moves a little slowly (normal for the time-frame and writing style), and there are some funny ideas about natural science, but the storyline is good adventure."
3,Lots of physics type detail.,It seemed to drag on in the endless detail of how to construct stuff.The ending was anti climatic almost as if the writer had run out of thing to say.
1,DRAGS on and on and on and on,This book is boring I can't read but 20 or 30 pages of it before I start falling asleep on it. i would recommend a pass on this one.
1,Mysterious Island,"Price great - shipping astronomical! I ordered it June 6 and didn't get it until July 5!!! Yes, you stated it could take that long but seriously that is just ridiculous! I won't be buying any more books through Amazon..."
5,I look forward to reading more Jules Verne,I never before read the classics as I did not have the money/opportunity so these offerings are fantastic. Stayed up far to late in the night reading this - it's that good!
5,Jules Verne,"Jules Verne is the ""Father of Science Fiction"" because of works like this one. He remains one of my favorite authors!"
4,Mysterious Island,Great Read! A little too detailed at times but the action never stops. A few amazing predictions were made long before their time! This should be required reading for college!
3,Good read,"Even though it was written a long time ago, it's still interesting enough to keep you entertained. I was intrigued by the movie ""Journey 2."""
5,Great book!,One of the better fiction books I've read in a long time. Jules Verne is a master at subtly building suspense!
3,Interesting but I haven't finished it yet.,"It is unusual reading for me, so far I am curious to keep going. Many scientific facts which keep me interested. Long way to go."
5,It's a really good read,"I liked this book a lot. I bought it for there wasn't 20,000 Leagues at that time at the bookstore, but after reading both, I'd say that both are good, but Mysterious Island is more enjoyable to read. I was really impressed by the brains shown, and got me wondering if I could think stuff like that if I ever got stranded."
1,Fails the test of good Science Fiction -- and boring to boot.,"In my opinion, good science fiction must do two things: it must address ultimate questions about the human condition and it must be absolutely honest about the reality of those questions. It can be as far-fetched as the imagination of the author wants to go -- but it can't fudge on this criteria.Mysterious Island presents technology and education as the ultimate answers to the mess this world is in -- but the 20th century blows that theory to Kingdom come."
4,"Mellow, Thoughtful and Good",This album reminds me of Reba's For My Broken Heart. I think that it has a lot of feeling and emotion on it-but that's good. I would have liked to hear a few more upbeat numbers but I understand what he was going for. Give it a few listens!
4,"Good news, bad news","Good news: I smiled thru all the honky tonk songs.Bad news: I cried thru all the sad songs, especially ""Good news, bad news"". Lee Ann Womack broke his heart and mine.But hey, that's what a good country songs are supposed to make you do."
4,Just George,This album is exactly what you'd expect from George. If you liked any of his previous 32 albums then you'll like this one too.
5,"Relaxing, old-fashioned country","George Strait's latest collection of songs may not be as catchy as most of the stuff on the radio today, but there's something to be said for sitting back and enjoying your music rather than bobbing your head along to it. There's only one fast song on the CD (""High Tone Woman""), so those who enjoy more of a country/pop feel may want to look elsewhere. However, Strait's smooth voice, along with some well-written lyrics and music, have a way of transporting you to a lazy day in a hammock down in the south, without feeling boring or repetitive. They're perfect for singing along, relaxing at home, or whatever mood you're in, since there's a good mix of sad and happy. The only knock I have against this is the duet ""Good News, Bad News""; George still sings beautifully on it, but Womack sounds like a dying animal when she holds a note. But that doesn't matter; skip over that track and enjoy the sweet country vibes."
2,Disappointing effort by a great country legend,"George Strait albums have never disappointed me in the past, so I eagerly awaited the release of his latest, ""Somewhere Down In Texas"". In comparison with previous releases by Strait, this album suffers greatly. It lacks the mixture of strong ballads and straight honky-tonk music that make Strait albums great. Usually I can wear a Strait album out (as my threadbare cassette tapes can attest), but after just a couple of listens, I put this one away."
2,Poor Effort,"This is yet another lack lustre effort from George.The lyrics in some of these songs are very odd.I live in the UK and i am a huge fan of great country music,this is very poor.George has lost his mantel of being the best in the USA.Please could songwriters send George some decent songs with proper lyrics.What more can i say....."
2,It's Okay . . .It'll get the job done . . .Like the Spurs. . .yawn,"Well, there's nothing on there like ""Ace in the Hole,"" ""The Chair,"" ""Amarillo By Morning"" You know, something danceable, along with ""heartfelt"" songs. (Or like Clint Black's first album. Now that was fanastic!) It's doable. It's okay. Yawn.People from Texas that will not acknowledge that there are 49 other states, they will love it. People from Texas and from other places who feel he has become the Sinatra of country (is his version of ""My Way"" coming? And I love Sinatra, usually) will think ""Come on, get a little edge on!""Whatever . . ."
4,"great lug nuts, could use a stronger key","The McGard lug nuts are very good looking, and the black chrome finish seems hard and durable. They look great on the car. My only complaint would be that the key is a thin aluminum, and seems like it could fail with frequent use. Then again, if you're taking your wheels off frequently, it might be best to go with regular lug nuts or racing lugs."
4,"Steve Nugent for Fab Magazine, Toronto, April 1998","The writing here is graceful and stylish which is in keeping with the theme of the novel - the fashion industry. Who can resist the visual impact of those beauties prancing down the catwalk, trying to make us believe that the clothes mean something to them while we know that they just want us to look at them?The unsophisticated Warden Fields, from Toronto, is one such, having been pressured to model in Europe by a model agency. He had earlier been spotted in a group of volleyball players at Hanlan's Point for a jean commercial as the all-Canadian boy. So off he goes, in his naive way, to be absorbed into that volatile atmosphere, and to fall for Joshua who puts political activism before commitment, thereby drawing him into illegal activity, and eventually, jail.The story is fluid and clearly based in the author's experiences in the fashion trade, he is only unconvincing when he assures us, for legal purposes, that it is a work of fiction."
4,"Sebastian Beaumont for Gay Times, London, U.K., February 199","A Cage of Bones is a story set largely in the modelling world. Warden is Canadian and unaware of the commercial potential of his looks until he is whisked away to fame and fortune by an Italian modelling agency. Jeffrey Round clearly knows the business he is writing about, and gives the story a pleasing twist when he injects his narrative with high drama in the form of Warden's affair with Joshua Behrens, a radical pop star with political ideals, who will drag Warden into deeper trouble than he can possibly imagine.A good read."
2,Wrong Track Listing,"I was disappointed when I received this CD. The Amazon site lists five other tracks besides Born To Be Alive. I bought the CD for the song You Turn Me On. This song does not exist on the CD. It only contains three versions of the song Born To Be Alive. If this is the only song you want, then this is a good CD. If, however, you are hoping to hear any of the other five songs, steer clear. They don't exist. Whatever happened to truth in advertising?"
5,"Thank you, Patrick","I just had the lyrics of this song tattooed on my back. My wife is a soldier overseas and when she gets back and sees this....(I'll make sure to have the song playing in the meanwhile) she'll either be my eternal love slave or she will divorce me. Regardless, this is the best song ever created."
5,I think about you Collin Raye,"Older CD by Collin, but another one of my favorites. Nice mix of some of his signature songs and beautiful vocals. If you are a fan, consider adding this CD to your collection."
5,The singing and the writing in this c.d. are really great.,"This c.d. is fantastic! I was very impressed with the song writing, and I don't think the singing could have been any better. This c.d. reminds me of Collin Raye's earlier c.d. ""Extremes"" because it contains several great songs that never became singles. ""The Time Machine"" sticks out in particular to me. This is one c.d. I can listen to over and over again and actually like more every time I hear it. I highly reccomend it!"
2,Made Cheap,"Not durable, broke off clip in a short time. I have had other cases that lasted for over a year, this one only several weeks."
1,Watch the THAI ORIGINAL FILM Instead of This Garbage,"What was wrong with the Thai original of ""Bangkok Dangerous""? Not flashy, superficial, and soul-less enough for Hollywood execs? Do yourself a favor, dear viewer--skip this awful Cage corruption and get your hands/eyes on the original Thai version of ""Bangkok Dangerous,"" still widely available on DVD and really only a few years old. Sheesh--Hollywood: quit taking real art and turning it into vapid trash! Why is it in America that we can't leave well enough alone and have so much trouble appreciating and respecting other cultures and perspectives? Blech--pure dreck."
1,Nicholas Cage has a way of putting me to sleep,"Cage has this tiring, sleep-inducing, monotone when he speaks. Especially when he narrates the film he's in. I don't know what his continued appeal is but Hollywood still sees a means of investment in him.This story seems familiar, like I've seen it before with different actors. It might have even been a Thai film. I can't remember. But, I do believe that the one I saw earlier entertained me more than this Nicholas Cage version did, which is unusual because Thai films aren't really all that great at all."
1,wast of time,"should have taken a nap instead. I think this is probably Nicolas Cage worst moves, it seamed like it he really didn't care about his role. The story and ending was pretty poor, I just could not believe it, it didn't make any sense."
1,WARNING!!,"Contrary to what this site says, THIS title IS REGION ONE encoded, and will not work on Australian players. Annoyingly I have wasted my money again :("
1,Bangkok Dangerous DVD (Single-Disc Edition),"Directed by: Oxide Pang ChunStarring: Nicolas CageRunning time: 99 min. R - 2008Someone needs to tell Nicolas Cage that it is alright for him to say ""No"" to an acting gig. In this film, which is a remake of a 2000 Thailand movie of the same name, Cage plays the roll of Joe the hitman. Joe is sent to Bangkok to do his last job but things go south and the wrong people start dying. Cage's character falls in love with a deaf girl so it feels like 20 minutes go by without any dialogue. There are some cool action scenes but not enough to save this film. This movie is bad, it's Bangkok Dangerous to your health.Run away!"
3,Good movie but awful Blu-ray,"The movie itself is good but the Bluray is the worst I've ever seen. To think that I paid $24 for it, what a waste. I should have bought the standard DVD."

2,"Boring Drama, not Dangerous at all","Great acting, great locations, great production, not very good story. I might be mistaken, but I thought the trailers for this film made it look like it was packed full of action, and tons of shooting. It was not. There was shooting in it, but few and far between. Like one of the other reviewers said, then the story gets very strange. Maybe it was that same reviewer who said you've also seen this movie before and I agree. Hitman kills for a living and stays alive by following 3 rules. Then for whatever reason, midlife crisis maybe, violates those three rules and then everything goes to he** in a hurry. I was expecting more like shoot 'em up or desperado (1995 with Banderas and Hayek), or Smokin' Aces. But instead of ""Bangkok Dangerous"" it was more like ""Boring Drama""."
4,Pretty Cool movie.,"This movie is an Americanized version of a Thai film that actually stunk pretty bad. Nicolas Cage plays a hit man that is sent to Thailand to complete a series of political hits. There he meets a deaf girl that he develops feelings for. He also takes on an apprentice. After seeing the normal side of life he decides to stop his murderous ways and do the right thing. This decision may cost him his life though.This movie is pretty cool. It has action and drama. The video quality is pretty good as well. Like all of his movies Nicolas Cage is the same. His personality doesn't ever seem to differ no matter what role he's playing. Even so this is an entertaining watch, and it's well worth the money."
2,A really tough movie to watch....,"I bought this movie because I've been to Thailand 10 times, and I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage, that is, I used to be. This movie was just as bad as the critics said it was, and does not leave a good impression of Bangkok or Thailand either. Liked getting the digital copy. It will give me something to watch next trip to Thailand. Nick, you can make better films than this. Try harder next time."
3,Nice Travelogue of Bangkok,"At the beginning of the movie, I was disappointed to hear Nick cage's character start narrating the film and spoon feeding the plot to the audience. Follow that up with a focus on the venue (Bangkok) rather than the characters, and what could have been a great action movie turned rather mediocre and failed to emotionally invest the audience. Even the finale doesn't really leave an emotional impression - it was just kind of an oh well moment with a quick transition to the Blu-Ray extra features. Speaking of the extra features, they included an alternate ending that was typical Hollywood happy ending - glad to see they didn't use it."
2,A miss for Nicolas Cage,"This hitman Joe, (Nicolas Cage) spends a lot of his time training a street-wise con artist named Kong (Shakrit Yamnarm), to be his ""understudy"" only for his student to get kidnapped and spill the beans of Joe's location in a......never mind. Joe falls in love with a deaf, pretty drugstore clerk named Fon (Charlie Young), only for her to see him kill two street thugs....never mind. Nicolas Cage sported some ratty long hair with his receding hairline that made him look really slimy. The ending was extremely bad. And what a stinking, lousy ending it was. Terrible editing."
5,Bangkok Dangerous,"The movie was as I expected it to be, excellent. I will take great joy in adding it to my collection."
3,"Cage rules, but movie was crap.","I gave this three stars rather than one because Nicolas Cage is a good actor and has made multiple great movies. This one however, is not one of them. The effects, the cast, and the music were all pretty good, but the overall way the movie played out was dull and predictable. I actually fast forwarded through parts of it because it was so boring. (The boat chase for example) This is the kind of movie that when its over, you'll likely be pretty ticked off that you sat all the way through it. Also, I dont want to spoil it for anyone, but the ending was total crap. Cage is the man, but this movie was a dud."
1,move on,"I fast forward through chunks of this movie - too many stupid things happen - including him saying never get involved with others, but then he goes way out of his way to get involved with others (not like it happened naturally) and then the ending - lame."
4,Action Packed,"Starts with a bang and gets better from there! If you love action, suspense, and an awesome 7.1surround soundtrack, then this movie is for you!"
3,Middle-of-the-road performance,"Nicholas Cage delivers a not bad performance and the action is fairly good, but over all, this is a dark, ugly movie."
5,Bangkok Dangerous,"This is one of Nick Cage's movies that's a remake of an older film.....I've seen both of them and both have merit, but this version in my mind is better...the action is intense....the story is riveting and the acting is powerful....."
3,wrong ending,"fairly decent movies,good action with a love store woven inbut the ending ruined the movie for me"
2,"Leaving Las Vegas with guns, Zzzzzzzzzzzzz......","The director took a good idea and turned it into Bankok Dangerous, a snoozy action film about a cliche of a hitman who takes on one last job before retiring. Anybody who has seen a few action flicks could've written this screenplay. Nick Cage stars as the bored,boring hitman.There are some decent action scenes to break up the tedium and Cage does a decent job in this disjointed film.Stay awake long enough and you will be rewarded with a big gunfight scene at the end. Don't expect much throughout however."
2,Not all that great,"I expected more from this movie. I'm not sure if it was more violence or martial arts but as a whole it didn't it for me. And i know they were sticking with the concept of the end in the original movie, but i thought the putting the two heads together thing was stupid. There was no sexual tension between Cage and the girl. Some of the scenes in this movie were alright (like the hot asian chicks). Overall I'd say this movie was a little less than OK."
3,Something to add,"Some movies try to say to much. Some movies spend too much time blowing stuff up and showing people killed in excruciating detail. The Hong Kong style of film making, at times, tries to bridge that gap. Joe, portrayed by Nicholas Cage, is a killer aware that time in his trade is growing short and its time for one big score and get out intact. As in the real world, life takes mysterious turns. This is not a happy film. It is dark, moody and brooding. I recommend you watch this film entirely and then make a judgement."
3,Who cut your hair man?,"I kept hearing the old Cheech & Chong joke in my head throughout this movie. ""Any questions? Yeh, Who cut your hair man?""Bangkok Dangerous was action packed, but still came across to me as lackluster. The story of a world weary hit man and a budding student has been done before, and I still think that a much better film was the Charles Bronson movieThe Mechanicwhich had parts that I still remember after 30 some years since I saw it the first time.Here's the deal,Bangkok dangerous is an action packed film, a pretty hackneyed plot, and a very bad hair do. There are certainly worse movies out there, but there are lots of better ones to watch as well. However, if you are a big Cage fan, you should like it just fine.2 *"
2,Bangkok Meh,"Nicolas Cage as a hitman who grows a conscious in Thailand. The directors (The Pang Brothers) desperately want to be the next Jon Woo, and the film's action sequences are entertaining enough in the first half of the film. However, instead of the action and drama increasing throughout the course of the movie they instead lessen and the film finishes with a seriously weak ending."
1,Bad Quality blueray to grainy,The movie itself isnt to good but most of all the picture is way way to grainy. This movie is the worst of the bluerays as far as picture quality. All the bluerays I bought when they first came out and they were converting non blueray movies in to blueray were all very grainy to the point I stopped getting them untill recently. I have to say this is the worst of the bunch. I even returned it for a replacement and it was the same. Dont waste your money on the blueray version.
1,Bangkok Monotonous,"Banal and pedestrian hit man story. Nic Cage is completely unbelievable as a super assassin who is tasked to carry out four kills in Bangkok. Along the way, he befriends a young Thai, and teaches him the secrets of his dark art (for example, ""squeeze the trigger, don't pull it"", he says, in one scene, duh... or ""use reflective surfaces to look behind you"", duh...). He also hooks up with a Thai girl (who, predictably, is mute) and eats really spicy food. If you like thrills, suspense and action, then AVOID this movie. If you want to fall asleep, then watch this.Nic's deadliest weapon is his awful hair, which completely fails to conceal his repetitive, painful acting. His star really has fallen very far, and rubbish like Bangkok Dangerous will not revive his career."
1,Not an action movie,"Cage supposedly a great killer, the likes of Bourne, all of the sudden does a 180, the scenes in Bangkok are slow, you don't know his motivation for taking a liking to his hired help, which previously we had seen that he kills without remorse, or why he falls for a mute girl. Also the supposed martial arts training was dumb, he should have at least taken some martial arts training. Couldn't finish watching the movie, the characters are so unlikable."
2,"Serves purpose, but thats it...","It does hold the ironing board, but the part that goes over the door is thick. I wish I had gone with a flat metal hanger instead. Also, if you have a tall door or your short, this literally holds it at the top of the door."
3,DOES ITS JOB--SOMEWHAT,"This item is very lightweight and made of soft flexible plastic. Because the mfg wanted to make it as cheaply as possible, it is made as small as possible. The flexible plastic curls a bit. When you take down your ironing board the hooks are hugging the ironing board bar that hangs on it. UNLESS YOU ARE TALL, GET ON A STEP STOOL, OR YOUR IRONING BOARD FLOOR BRACKET IS A TINY SPINDLE LIKE THIS PICTURE SHOWS, THIS THING IS COMING DOWN EVERY TIME TO YOU REMOVE THE IRONING BOARD. Likewise, EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO HANG YOUR IRONING BOARD, YOU HAVE TO GET A STEP STOOL TO PUT THE HOOK AND IRONING BOARD BACK UP. To understand better, look and the ironing board in the vendor picture. The spindle that goes onto the hooks is very small in circumference."
4,Xscape Never Disappoints,"This is a great album. It is not my favorite Xscape release because their debut album pushed out top notch R&B classics. Off the Hook was very popular at the time, but a lot of these songs have faded in memory. You're more likely to find someone who remembers "" Just Kicking "" and "" Understanding "" from Xscape's first album than songs from Off the Hook. It's a great listen for Xscape fans and lovers of R&B-90's style. But it doesn't compare to their smoking debut release in any way, shape or form."
2,Not powerfull enough,"I bought this because I read on some of the reviews that it had worked well with TV & PS2. I needed it to work with TV & Xbox. It did NOT. I guess it is partly my fault. I did not take the time to make sure it was adequate for the job. It would run the Xbox OK or a 9"" TV OK. But as soon as I would plug Xbox & TV it would turn itself off. At least it did not blow my fuse. That's what kept it from getting one star."
1,Horrible,Worked with my old laptop after having it for 2 years and getting a 10x more powerful truck it started screeching if the truck was just running off battery power. Wouldn't allow me to use my laptop anymore. I am looking for something that would work a lot better than this piece of junk. Very disapointed that it worked with a laptop. The laptop I use now is older than the one that it was being used for and is giving me problems. Will never buy from this company again.
1,Poor Reliability,Used this inverter once to power up a 32 inch LCD TV during a power failure. Worked fine. Tried 8 months latter and unit was dead (only the fan worked). Past the warranty so I got 3 hours of service out of this junk. Read the warranty on these inverters. The only manufacturer that gives you a decent warranty is Whistler...2 years.
5,Jensen JP30 Inverter,This thing works great. No problems with it what so ever. I read some others complain of the fan noise but it wasn't loud enough to bother me at all. I strongly recommend it!
1,Did not work for us at all,"Been a while so don't recall all the specifics, but returned this one after would not keep our laptop powered up at all. I read instructions, was very, very careful to do everything right but found myself so disappointed on that first road trip."
3,blows fuse in large dodge truck just going down the road,We haven't actually plugged anything into it yet we just drove about an hour out of town and plugged it in to see what would happen. After about 30 minutes it blew the fuse in the truck and haven't used it since. Will let you know what happens.Phillip
5,great product.,this inverter works great. it has not once over heated. this powers my laptop with planty of power to spare. this inverter is highly recommended by me.
5,GREAT,"this inverter does wonders. On a road trip this past summer, we drove from colorado all the way out to new york city, with many stops in between. The whole time, we had the tv and ps2 hooked up thru the inverter, and never did we have any problems. played constantly, it was great. DEFINITELY BUY IT if you are looking for a way for your kids to have fun in the car, or wherever. WORTH EVERY LAST PENNY!"
4,AC power in my car?,"This unit is perfect for my mobile ac power needs. Recharging my laptop while I drive is a snap. This is the answer for running my sons electronic video games that don't have the typical car charger. Unfortunatly, I do need to report that the cooling fan is a bit noisy. In most vehicles road noise drowns out the fan. But if you have a quite vehicle or you are stopped you can hear the fan clearly and it can be a bit irritating. Overall a great unit."
1,Good specs/poor quality,"Product appeared to be exactly what was ordered, however when hooked up to the auto power supply it did not work. Unfortunately not used immediately returned after 30 days. Not a satisfied customer."
3,not bad..,I bought this to bring with me on the road because i drive all day for work and comes in handy. It works well so far. I just wish that it came with an extra fuse in case it burns out. It also came with jumper cables? have not got a chance to try it out. But i does not look like something that i would use.
3,GREAT,WORKED GREAT WITH THEIR COMPUTER AND OTHER ITEMS WHEN THEY ARE IN THE CAR. I RECOMMEND IT OVER MOST I HAVE TRIED.
2,"Works as others have reviewed, including the noisy fan",This would have been a fine inverter if it wasn't for the fact that the fan started buzzing and making an awful racket after just three days on the road. That alone is why I gave this product a two star rating. There's no excuse on the manufactures part for using a cheap fan that goes kaput in just a matter of days. I'd shop around a bit more if I were you.
4,Jensen JP30 300 Watt Power Inverter,"Jensen Dual-Outlet 300-Watt DC to AC Inverter JP-30This works great! Noise is not a problem. But it is much bigger than I expected. I bought it so I would never have to buy another cell phone charger for my car. The last one never fits the new one. But I didn't expect it to be so big. It will work for TVs. No matter, I like it."
4,Good Product,"Good product, the only thing I detected, was a noice of the fan.....I pluged in two devices, and I have not problems."
2,Kind of works,"I bought this unit and made sure it worked as soon as I arrived, unfortunately I did not do a full load test of the unit within 30 days and when I went to use it on a road trip the unit failed when I plugged in two things (less than 100W total). I've used a multimeter to verify the voltage off the car battery and have even done the direct connection to the battery and it still fails which shows that it's not some internal current limiting circuitry of my car."
3,power inverter,"This product works well. Used it on a 10 hour drive to power my laptop and a portable dvd player for my kids. Though, if I had it to do over again I'd get one with 3-4 outlets. This is only due to the size of the plugs on the devices in use. Not because the number of outlets was insufficient."
3,"Works, but noisy","The product works fine, but I find the fan to be too noisy. I can accept some fan noise, but this is too much. I rarely use it because of the noise."
1,Padding at its worst.,"Though it's listed at 208 pages, my copy was only 168 pages long; of which, 50 were devoted to a list of training programs. No effort was made to rank the programs by quality or respect within the industry. If a book is padded at least it should be comprehensive, but the list of computer magazine and their URLs later in the book didn't even include PC Magazine! The section on computer repair in Paul and Sarah Edwards' ""The Best Home Businesses for the 21st Century"" contained at least as much real information as this book and it's only 7 pages long. I suspect this book was written and published for a quick buck and I intend to avoid this author and publisher in the future. If someone knows of a truly useful book on this subject I would be grateful to hear of it."
3,Not on Par with Similar Offerings,"As a casual anime purchaser, I have to say I was expecting more from this collection. I really enjoyed Vexille and the Appleseed movies, which sport the same aesthetic appeal. However, TO has little by way of replay value. Think of something like the Animatrix or Batman: Gotham Knight, but limit the experience to two short stories. The stories are not connected by anything more than time and setting. Everything offered on the discs feels abbreviated, including the extras.While the stories are interesting, I could only recommend this to anime fans looking for something a bit different with expendable cash. This is a better rental than something to add to your collection."
2,Meh,"Picked it up at a big box store before there were any amazon reviews, bit of a mistake there.Animation very dated, looks like it pre-dates Appleseed and the Final Fantasy movies actually. Music track sounds like it was created on someone pc not done by a studio. The idea for the story and voice acting is only reason I give it two stars. You could compress it down to a 20 minute episode and it would still feel too long though."
1,"Move over Snyder, Bruche","I could go on and on with some self-serving pompus review of this movie, but the bottom line is, all the intensity, drama, action, splendor and provocation will be found in the trailer.Anything other than that found in the actual viewing of the movie will leave you short of less than two hours of your precious life.No idea who, what or why this garbage is funded and produced."
4,Why?!?!?!,"I'm afraid to say it but this is just a re-issue with a different name. This is a re-release of Corpse Grinder, which if I remember correctly is now out of print, which if you are a meteors fan at all you will immediately notice. So it's good in the sense that if you weren't able to pick up Corpse Grinder, you can get this album, but at the same time if you have Corpse Grinder this is basically a waste of money, oh well."
5,A Book Review From a Spiritridge Third Grader,"I read this jail breaking book called Detective LaRue. Two cats ran away from their home and a dog named Ike gets blamed. There is a jumbo sized dilemma but I can't tell you. The police are working on another case so Ike takes it into his own hand, I mean paw. You have to read the rest to find out what happens.I like this book because Ike dreams funny things like that he is in jail when he was with a nice police.I recommend this book to anyone because it is funny and good."
3,"Great illustrations & storyline, but for what age?","My children 6,5,and 3 love Pigsty, another Mark Teague story, and I love the illustrations. And the illustrations, and original story line are great in this book also, but as I read it to my children, I wondered: what age group is this written for? Sometimes I wonder if childrens publishers every bother reading these manuscripts to a child? By the time my daughter understands what ""dire,"" ""intrepid,"" and ""apparent"" mean, she will be beyond picture books. And these three words were on just one page. I love when books introduce new vocabulary to children, but I find that often publishers take it too far, and unfortunately, this is the case here."
5,Detective LaRue: Letters from the Investigation =Excellent,Detective LaRue should have won the Caldecott award. It had a excellent storyline and perfect illustrations to match the mood. Why it lost to Kittens First Full Moon is quite a mystery to me. I would recommend it for ages 10-12.
1,The Worst,"This is the worst book I have EVER read. The entire book can be condensed into three or four platitudes, which are all faulty. The logic that valuing diversity is intuitive is ridiculous. History will bear out the fact that this inevitable social revolution never happened, and probably never will, at least the way the authors believe.There is one good chapter however. That is Chapter 5, Decoding Garbled Communication. This is helpful but the rest of the book was dreadful. The only thing more boring was Stephen Ambrose's book about Lewis and Clark."
3,Good Book for Beginners,I purchase this book to use in my beginners computer class and it is ok. It explain the history of computers and about the different hardware. It is more for beginners not for person who have a good knowledge of the Pc and its applications.
3,A bit weaker here.,"Ranma's fight with Ryoga aburptly ends when Akane gets an unexpected ""haircut."" One of the nicer scenes between the Ranma and Akane gets shown afterwards. Also, we learn why Ryoga's so angry at Ranma in the first place... hmm, maybe it has to do with the sudden arrival of a little black piglet named P-chan. However, although the episodes start off strong, with quite a few funny scenes, it falls apart near the end, when P-chan is adopted by a wealthy family and now Ranma has to go look for him. I feel that part was pointless, added on in the last second. If it wasn't for that part of the second episode, I would have scored this higher."
5,This is where I fell in Love,"I was lucky enough to see Acoustic Alchemy perform live one Friday in 1995 and I was blown away. This album was the one I purchased that very night at their concert (by Sunday night I owned every CD they'd released). ""Homecoming"" was the first song of the first set and still makes me smile. I think that ""Lullaby for the first born"" is the finest of all the Webb/Carmichael two handers. There's not a bad track on here."
4,good stuff,"If you like airy jazzy acoustic goodness, then this CD is One you should really have in your CD collection."
3,book review,this book is well illustrated and contains precise repair instructions. however there are many years of this vehicle with slight to major production differences that this book does not cover.
5,Great guide,"Bought this for a friend who will be driving his Landcruiser from Amsterdam to Singapore. He was excited about all the detailed info, diagrams, photos etc. Hope it will come in handy along the trip. Haynes always amazes me, they make such great manuals."
5,As described,The manual was a as described. It arrived on time and in great condition. Would purchase from this vendor again
3,Must have for 4 series landcruiser owners,"Fantastic manual for all FJ40, 43, 45 & 55 cruiser owners and fans. The repairmanual is there for the TOYOTA Landcruiser versions from 1968 thru 1982, so no FJ42's!!Pitty though the manual just subscribes the 6 cylinder petrol engines both 3878cc and 4230cc and not the diesel versions. A lot of the technology other than the engines is simular for all models. It's highly recomendable for those who want exploded views of parts, chassis and body.Theo BIEN (BJ40 cruiser-user)"
5,Very nice just as pictured!,"Large sign, high quality metal and work, really nice if you are a BMW enthusiast!"
3,"good, but....","second book I've read by this author. Was fairly good but not as good as this author's Lady Blue. These 70's Regencies are very ""old school""-high drama, wilting females and machismo males, and nasty villains. 3 stars."
4,Very happy with this item...,"Exactly as described, well built, solid, great look to it. Only complaint is that the clear sealer on the bronze is a bit uneven, but not so much as to make it worth returning. The glass shades look great."
1,Had to Return item,"Connections on transmitter were not for home TV or Receiver.If your Dispay on item specified that it was for auto/car or diderentiated more clearly the dfference between home and auto use, I would ot have wasted my tiem. coe indicated a"
2,Pyle headphones,"This product arrived within the shipping date, but the package looked pretty rough. I would have rated it higher if it was ready to use right out of the box. The transmitter has to be wired to an alternate DC power source which isn't provided. Hopefully after getting it set up, they will be worth the hassle."
3,preformance of headphones,"clarity of audio not as good as expected,loss of signal when hands moved in area of face.but ok for the price."
3,Not item shown!,"These are decent headphones; a little on the dull side for my taste and the transmitter works fine (no, there is no power supply as it's meant for auto installation), but this is not the item shown. The units that are shipping are the old WH5s which have simply been relabeled WH6. I prefer the sound of the old WH6 phones (which are pictured), although they are not as sturdy as WH5s."
1,waste of money,"There is no plug! What a waste! The adapters cost as much as the headset and the people at Radio Shack still couldn""t get it to turn on."
1,Dont waste your money!!!,"the most awful product ive ever bought online. was hard to setup. one of the headphones was not working and the one that was ""working""had static sound. i am returning the package for a refund and hopefully that will be done right."
4,Buenos audífonos,"Estos audífonos funcionan realmente bien. Los uso para oir musica en mi computadora y funcionan bien, el sonido es mas limpio que usando audifonos inalambricos con señal fm. Estos trabajan con señal infraroja y tienen menor alcance pero, sonido mas adecuado. La desventaja de este artículo es que no trae el suplidor de corriente por lo que tienes que comprar un adaptador; trae los dos cables pelados para que le agregues el conector que te permita enchufar el transmisor, ojo, en la caja no viene el adaptador de corriente, asi que al comprarlo no creas que podrás usarlo de una vez si no tienes el adaptador de 12 voltios adquirido previamente. Los audífonos usan dos pilas AAA. Sin embargo este dispositivo está muy bien hecho. Puedes comprarlo con confianza."
3,Hidden Facts,"Althought the specs say that a 12V power source is needed for the transmitter, this fact is not readily apparent in the product description. One easily assumes that all is required is 2 AAA batteries per headset. In reality you need a 12V DC power source before anything will work."
4,VERY GOOD HEADPHONES,"I bought these headphones so that I would not disturb others in adjacent apartments. They work very well. The infrared transimitter is not subject to radio frequency noise and therefore virtually noise free. As with others, my primary complaint is that no transformer comes with the unit. I found a transformer on Ebay for $10.00 shipping included. In addition, I had to buy heat shrink tubing, a soldering iron, solder and male plugs for the audio connection. Also I find the foam on the earpieces a little uncomfortable with extended use, but I'm having a quilter friend fabricate silk covers for them. Everything included, I would definitely buy these again. They are much more than adequate and deliver great clear sound."
3,Not great for kids 5 and under,I bought these separately but for my Pyle mobile DVD player. They work fine but like most I bought them for my kids. Within 2 months they have broken both battery caps and I've had to use tape to keep them together. While my kids are age 5 and 3 they are not overly destructive kids. I have since bought 2 new pairs with different ear pieces since the foam pieces look like they may also begin to go.
4,Nigel's showtime,"This video is a pure Nigel show time for those who enjoy classical music from a different angle. I am sure, as was my case with youngsters, that this type of sincere, althought very particular, aproach to music making of great classical pieces atract strongly younger and not classical fanatics audiences as well.Nigel is a great self interpreter of classical music which atuned to his particular character make for an enjoyable watch. I am a 44 year old violinist and continue to enjoy Kennedy's performances as well.Fausto"
5,"super audio and video, exciting","If you want something new, want excitement, this is for you. sound and video is good and clear. The performance is vigorous and unique. Kennedy is like a rock star. If you are very conservative, you may have problem with this one."
4,Great performance,"What is special on this recording , is the passion and the way Kennedy puts himself into Vivaldi.Excellent musicians playing excellent music :what more do you need...There is also a fine Dolby and DTS score on this disc"
2,I'm reading now,It's a downer..nohing is happening and unless we have a bang up ending it's not so good. I expected more fromPuzo.
4,Good Read,"Mario Puzo instantly became on of my favorite writers after reading the Godfather series. This book doesn't quite compare, but it was a good book - the subject of post WWII Germany is something I found really interesting and little written about."
2,"Sound writing, lackluster story","This is not a great book. Even though it is Puzo, who has done some great work, this story is mediocre at best. I have read every work of fiction by Mario Puzo and I would place this one at the bottom of the pile. It's not a terrible book, but you could do a lot better. The story is about post WWII Germany, and an American soldier named Walter Mosca who is stuck in a daydream of post-war reorganization and exploitation. The story is slow at times, and I found my mind wandering a lot during the middle. It comes together nicely at the end, and is certainly well crafted, but I would recommend this book only to Puzo fans, especially to those interested in reading his complete catalogue. That is basically the only reason I read this book, and it is not one I care to read again. Nor is it a story that will live long in my memory.Mark McGinty is the author of Elvis and the Blue Moon Conspiracy"
4,An old favorite,"My son is now 15 years old, but I still remember the many times that I had to borrow Cowboy Small from the local library so we could read about his adventures. We would act out the things that Cowboy Small would do over and over. I am trying to find an original version for Christmas, but maybe this will do."
2,They've Updated Cowboy Small...,"... and they didn't do a very good job of it!My son and I have read an older (from the 90s) version of the book and loved it. So I purchased the newest board book version- and they've really changed it. The story has been shortened: no bedroll, no fixing the fence, no branding. And the language has been dumbed down, too- no currying, for example. Too bad! I'll be giving away the new version and buying an older, used one instead! I'd recommend any other Mr. Small fans do the same."
3,Board Book version is abridged -- not the full Lenski narrative,"We love Lois Lenski, and the great detail and vocabulary in her books. We bought the board book version of this, and I was very disappointed. The illustrations are the lovely Lenski illustrations, but the text is very much simplified and pretty boring. It's okay for the youngest of kids (e.g., the one and maybe 2 year olds), but for 3 and up, get the hardback version that has the complete text."
5,Must have for young reader's collection,"This is a great book to read aloud to your toddler/preschooler. New vocabulary is introduced in a clear, concrete way. The illustrations are wonderful. A much-loved book in our collection. A classic!"
5,First Grade Love,I read this story aloud to my first grade class and they absolutely loved the story of Cowboy Small. I actually think that there favorite part was the pictures at the beginning of the story of all of the stuff a cowboy needs! We had a great discussion on that!
4,Cute Book,I purchased this book for my almost 4 year old nephew. He is all about cowboys! He had me read the book to him a few times in my visit with him and he asked a lot of questions about it. It was a great learning book and just a lot of fun. Very cute book! I love how it has pages that label the parts of the horse and cowboy's attire.
5,A brilliant performance from a true artist !!!!!!,"I love this CD !!!! The talent of her artistry and the emotional resonance of her gifted voice really shines through on this CD. I have been a huge fan of hers throughout the years and it's great tosee her grow and evolve and change; but all the while, staying true to what she is GREAT at: singing a beautiful song with passion and presense and talent--- so rare these days.I hope she will continue to perform and record. All of her recordings are amazing, and this is no exception. Buy it, appreciate her talent, and wish her continued happiness and success."
4,Well done!,Having seen Ms. Olivor live a few times recently it was great to have this recording to capture those memories. A nice mix of new and old songs. Some nice interaction with the audience.If you are new to Jane Olivor this is an excellent place to start.I still would like to see a new studio album. There are a truckload of songs out there that beg for a Jane Olivor interpretation. I would love to see a Jane Olivor Broadway album. There are some good popular songs that I know Ms. Olivor can make even better. I think there is some top 40 success left in Ms. Olivor if she could just get hooked up with the right songs and right management.She is too talented to be appreciated by only the limited number of people that have had the patience to follow her career.
4,Nice to hear her again,"Love the voice; have been following her since the we heard her duet with Jhonny Mathis (1978 - ""Same Time, Next Year"". Have heard her live, twice. Love the alblum, but wish she would put more new material in each alblum (thta's why it's a 4 and not a 5)."
1,I have given up,"I will admit, I have seen her in concert at least a dozen times, have bought all her albums, cassettes and the cd's. Then her DVD..... And considered her my favorite singer of all time... I have finally given up! She does not even have a website anymore! WTF??? Even John Denver and Cass Elliot have webs and they have been dead for years! She could have at least put out a CD every 3 years or so.... But no!!!!I can NOT listen to her 5 Columbia albums anymore! Please, give us something new! The Safe Return CD was just as it says. A Safe Return!"
4,not just how to punch,"I had expected this to be another book of techniques, which it certainly has. However, there is more, the book also helps develop the proper attitude and understanding of what a brawl/fight/confrontation really is. Additionally, there is also the back stories, told to relate how the author arrived at his conclusions. This is the best combat how-to I've had the pleasure to read."
4,Best Such Book I've Ever Read,"Not that I've read them all, or even a lot of them. However, this tome is a practical, no frills affair that attempts to impart important *principles*. There are plenty of useful tactics, methods, etc., and I suggest you read the other reviews for more details-- but just the description of ""the interview"" and what to expect thereafter is worth the price of the book. The admonishment that ""there are no guarantees in a fight,"" and the warnings about medical and legal consequences are very refreshing, and the author would rather flee than fight. Shouting ""Get away from me -- I don't need your macho b.s."" and leaving the scene of potential conflict is something that everyone should take to heart. The only drawback here, IMHO, is a shortage of photos and diagrams."
5,It is 1:30 am so I must be serious,"Why am I reviewing a book at 1:30am?I owe it to the author and to you . . . this is a very good book. Apart from great information it is a good read, interesting, entertaining but above all useful.Is it worth the price? if it can save you from a single punch in the head . . . or worse.There is no space to write much more and I am tired, but get it, read it, return it if you hate it, but I think you'll like it - if you are even remotely interested in it, give it a go.It is very good."
3,Too much text,"Too much text. Great information, but text exceeds by far the amount of pictures, so it will take a long time to get a real idea of the instruction."
3,! ! Beware ! !,"The title 18 ESSENTIAL SONGS is misleading for say? Some one who hasn't heard Janis in years, or is wanting to catch up with her. The fine print will tell you the truth. A consolidation from her box set. So this is for the fan who has all her stuff and want's to expaned on her gift's. Because there are some treasure's included here. But for our hard earned money, get ""Kozmic Blues"" and ""Pearl"". Both are avalible from Amazon.com. With add'd track's. You will have every thing great from Janis. ""In Concert"" would be a nice find }:-) Don't forget ""Cheap Thrills"" by Big Brother and the holding company."
3,Aaarrgghh. Somebody turn it off!!!,"There are some people that absolutley love Janis Joplin, I'm not one of them. The reason I bought this album, some years ago, was because I had heard Piece Of My Heart on one of those vietnam war era CD's (Tour Of Duty I think). If you think you might be into Janis, find the cheapest CD you can find. If you can listen to it all in one hit and enjoy it, play it a couple more times. If you still enjoy it, then get more. I just find her throaty shrieking voice too much to take after more than two or three songs. Still, the version of Mercedes Benz that appears on here (vocals only) is rather touching as it was recorded not long before she died."
3,Great for two tracks,"I bought this because it has the better version of ""Down On Me"" as recorded on Mainstream Records . Also of exception and making this collection worth the $$ spent is the acoustic version of ""Me and Bobby McGee""...it's a nice alternative to the original full band version...revealing the best qualities of Janis's voice."
2,Beautiful but empty,"I love Helen Merrin but she was miscast in this version of Tennessee William's story. Although she looks fabulous for her age, she was too old to make us believe in the relationship. Vivian Leigh was just 41 or 42 when she starred with Warren Beatty in the original (which despite being dated is a better film) and while I agree that it is true that the character of the widowed Mrs Stone could be older, almost everything about this film feels false, flat and unimpressive. However, Anne Bancroft is FANTASTIC as the Italian Contessa and her performance alone is worth a viewing. The locations of the film are gorgeous and I am glad I watched it, but overall I found it a terribly missed opportunity to tell a very compelling, sexy, dark, mysterious story without the restraints and limitations that constrained the original version."
5,PRIMAVERA 2000 .....,"RODRIGO SANTORO encapsulates it all by urinating in public in front of Karen Stone, played with appropriate angst by HELEN MIRREN -[come a long way from ""Caligula"" and ""Savage Messiah""]. The rest? Typical decaying Rome - but then again, being the eternal or infernal city - it always seems to discard the excrement and bloom forth anew.Fun moments with the ravenous Anna Bankcroft - paracitically living off everything within reach - reminded me strongly of the 'mother son' con artists [Sante something??]Even Brian Dennehy shines through the moments allowed, gowns and glam abound, but there's always that slight erotic stench left behind ....as someone enters or leaves a scene .......Forget Paolo Karen - the unwashed waif is far more interesting - and can be moulded .....[Would be fun to see a future version with Karen played by George Clooney ....... ""When In Rome"" ......"
3,The Roman Spring Of Mrs Stone,"The storyline is very boring and monotonus, but the scenes with Olivier Martinez are pretty hot. If you like Olivier Martinez, you will probably find more than one reason to watch it. This movie is along the lines of Unfaithful, which Olivier Martinez was in too. You might as well fast forward or skip the scenes without Olivier Martinez in them--he's what makes this movie watchable. If you liked the movie Unfaithful, I have a hard time believing you wouldn't be able to muddle through this movie. I gave three stars simply because Olivier is so sexy in this movie."
5,Great Movie!,"Helen Mirren is an outstanding actress, and Oliver Martinez just sizzles....go Halle :DGreat script, exellent acting...not overly dramatic, but hits you with just enought to leave you in awe...great movie."
2,Gift....?,"I ordered this book as a gift for my fiance. He added it to his wish list, so I blame him lol! He didn't like it much at all."
3,It is not about Josephus..,but about the edition itself. I found it a little bit difficult to read due to the size and style of the fonts. but otherwise Josephus is Josephus - you cannot beat that.
4,Great source of information,"Josephus is a great source for information about Biblical times. The format is similar to the Bible, but the language is not quite as clear as most of the common translations. I would recommend it as a historical companion to Biblical study."
5,Excelent,"I really like this book and i think the translator is really skilled but the thing that kinda bothers me is that...i think i would probably understand the book better if it was in its orginal language. But for what it is, its excellent!"
3,"Dry read, but informative","I use it more as a reference book to look up specific events. I don't have the fortitude to read it end to end. Interesting, nonetheless."
2,"Unless you are not a serious student, this is too much and too serious.","If you are looking for a book in relation to the New Testament, it is not for you."
2,You'll Need 20/20 Vision For This One,If the typeset on this book were any smaller you could have sold it as a novelty item: (e.g. - Works of Josephus On the Head of a Pin). Great idea to package the complete unabridged works - bad idea for making it extremely difficult for a lot of people to read!
2,Not for Serious Students,"For a better English translation and the Greek text on the facing page, see the appropriate volumes of the Loeb Classical Library."
3,The Works Of Josephus,A good reference source but Whiston neglected to say which version of the 'Wars of the Jews' he translated. Its obviously the Roumanian version parts of which are suspect since it differs markedly from other versions.
5,Intriguing book.,Intriguing book for any avid history buff. History relating to or very near the life of Christ.Chuck
3,Theology at its best,"If you like your Jewish history shaken not stirred, then Check this book out. I have been looking for a book on this note worthy hostorian. There are many like this, so I'm not sure how it compares."
4,Just what it was supposed to be,This product does what it is expected to do and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone at all.
4,Josephus- The Complete Works,A very good historical book for christians and jews and all other people who want a better understanding of the history during the time of Yeshua/Jesus.
2,You decide,I was wanting to read some biblical history from Josephusbut lost interest when seeing such small printin this book. It is kind of intimidating upon openingthe book to see all the fine print. Hope to get intoit someday.
5,a must have historical book,"One of the very few literary works of the very early years of our era that has survived in its entirety. A true, two thousand years old literary treasure. A must have."
4,Great Translation,This reads pretty well for someone who is interested in actually reading what Josephus wrote which was my goal. I highly suggest it.
3,Very complete but really tough to read.,"The positive on this book is the pricing and the fact that it includes everything. I've used this book as a handy reference, but the language is too King Jamesy to read for pleasure. Contemporary English it is not."
5,he loves it,I got this for my husband since he had given the copy he had to his son who is a pastor. He loves it and was thrilled that it was a hard back and unabridged!
5,loved it,I believe a very accurate portrayal of the life and times of the first century ad. A good book of comparison for religious research.
5,Well Known,It is an old classic. Those of us who are interested in Israel at the timeof the Roman destruction of the Temple and related issues cannot do without this book.
4,Helpful Bible tool,I didn't realize upon ordering this book that it is basically the Bible re-written in Josephus' words. It's helpful in Bible study and gives a deeper meaning to some of the Scriptures.
5,Enjoying it.,Great research work. I like having it on Kindle. Great price too. I've always wanted to read this but didn't want to invest a lot in it.
4,This history around the Bible,This text helps to put in perspective the religious and historical events of the Bible and the effects on each.
5,Great album,I love Eydie Gorme's voice and I think she is terrific on this album. I enjoy playing it often and the selection of songs is excellent!
5,Pure Music Enjoyment!!,"I get exctatic every time I hear this goddess's voice. Here you get her GREATEST HITS on 1 cd! You will melt,sway,rock,fall in love with her when you here this cd! Edyie is a GOD! Love to listen to this real late at night with the lights turned down low! and a bottle of red in hand!"
5,A KEEPER,"IF YOU'RE 50-65 YOU WHERE THERE, YOUR VIEWS CHANGED ALSO.BOB DARIN FOUND HIS FREEDOM WE ALL QUEST.ADD THIS TO THE SAME STACK, WITH DYLAN,COHEN,CLARK ,TOWNES AND SO ON. THIS WAS NOT , AS TOWNES SAID ""ZIPDY-DO DA...I THINK I'VE TRIED FOR 25 ARE MORE YEARS TO FIND THIS.WE STILL HAVE THE OLD LP SOMEWHERE..."
1,Not your usual Bobby Darin album,"If you're into Bobby Darin's ""hippie stage"", then this one is for you. Otherwise, you won't like it. As a 50's fan, I was really turned off by this album."
1,nearly $90.00 for the CD?This is Highway Robbery!,"I imagine this CD is fantastic in every way except the price.Is this a trend in the offing>Will we now see CD sellers scalping potential customers with outrageous prices?I might pay up to thirty bucks and I would also need to preview the tunes.I know,(a shrug of shoulders) and the reply,""Whatever the market will bear...""Is Amazon also selling it?I wonder?"
3,1st review,"does not show the regular family coat of arms such as williams, jones, elliott etc, this book is more for historians.If you are into genealogy of the well known welsh families from long ago, this book is for you, otherwise forget it"
5,Best in a can,"This is the only green chili enchilada sauce I will use. I just moved from Texas to Ohio, and I can't find it in any of the grocery stores in town."
4,Excellent Spice blends,"I am not a vegetarian and wouldn't normally buy a book dedicated to vegetarian dishes but I love Indian cuisine and the spicing techniques in this little book are excellent. The first section provides typical mixtures for seven common spice blends in southern India and then illustrates how they may be used in some interesting and easy to follow recipes. In truth, I probably won't make a lot of the dishes but perusing the book is a great starting point for all sorts of experiments."
1,Bad Plug,"I can't rate this item well, as it broke the first time I used it. The plastic on the plug that goes into the car outlet is very thin and it broke as I tried to remove it. The broken plug was then stuck in the outlet and it became very difficult to remove because the plastic shattered into many, tiny pieces. I would reccomend another inverter."
1,Blew my Camry's Fuses,"I got this inverter after reading all the reviews. I used it just once with my 65W laptop (for my Microsoft Streets and Trips) on an hour's trip and blew off a bunch of my car's fuses. Headlight, sideview mirrors, clock,... everything went off. Luckily, the fog lights were working, otherwise I would not have made it back home."
1,Not 110 to 120 volts output,"Purchased this item to take on a trip to charge cameras and cell phones, but did not check it out prior to leaving - Will not charge anything. It only puts out 88 volts - bad product"
1,nice while it lasted...,"I own(ed) two of these (now 1). They are quiet, and while 1 is still working, the other worked for only about 1 year, and now will consistently blow the accessory plug fuse in both vehicles, and has also apparently permanently damaged the electrical system in one vehicle (even replacing the blown fuse does not restore power the the accessory plug). Even though one of the two still works fine, I would recommend choosing a different inverter."
5,"Reliable, Good Deal, Solidly Built","We purchased this for recharging/running our laptops on a cross-country trip. It's a great size, plenty of power for my 90w Dell AC adapter (our last inverter would shut off... and started doing so at extremely inopportune times).I highly recommend it. Good deal for the price and solidly built."
5,Works Great!,I purchased this item for a long trip so I could charge and/or play my Zen mp3 player in the car without worrying about battery life on the trip. It worked great. I am also planning to use it for my notebook in the car the same way because the car adapter for my notebook costs $100.
5,Works Great!,"Does what it's suppose to do. Recharged several items (GPS, bluetooth, cell phone, etc.) during a recent family trip, and it was quiet and unobtrustive. Only thing to mention is that it should be turned off or unplugged when starting the vehicle; otherwise it will make a high-pitched squeal. But that is a minor issue, and I am very content with this product."
4,Power,I purchased this item for my husband to use when he is away from the house and need to use his computer. He thinks this is an excellent product.
4,Amazing Inverter,I am glad i bought this item.It powered my computer as it gave me directions from Minneapolis to Beaufort SC. Its a great item worth the money.
5,A great alternative,I used to have an AC outlet in my old car; now that I have a new one I thought my days of sitting back driving and letting the kids watch movies was over. Not so with this item. It provides enough power to run my 13 inch tv. I've had it for a month and I haven't had any problems with it. I recommend it to anyone seeking to put an outlet in their car; for just about any device.
2,bland,"Larry, as always, displays fine technical skill, fluency, and articulation, as well as the occasional tasty choice of notes however, there is just too much of that, ""wonder how long I'll be on hold on the phone?"" or ""when's my floor coming in the elevator"" sound about it. Certainly disappointing when you consider some of this artists fine achievements with the likes of Steely Dan etc."
2,Garbage,"I appreciate this album....but only because I respect Larry from his work with Steely Dan and his first two releases. A tremendous guitar player with limited song writing ability, who ought not to pick up an acoustic guitar. Despite the horrific cover to the album, Larry remains one of my favorites. This album is a must for dedicated fans, otherwise, keep your distance. Mullet."
5,Great fun for kids in the kitchen,"This is a great cookbook for parents and kids to do together. There are lots of pictures of each recipe - including pictures of the steps to demonstrate what is supposed to be done, then pictures of the finished food. The demonstration pictures are great for kids so that they can see what they need to do. I've done recipes with my 5-year-old daughter and she loves to pick out which food she wants to make and follow the instructions in the pictures. It also shows a picture of every ingredient needed so she can see the foods that go in and start learning measurements. The recipes are relatively simple and taste good to kids AND adults! I highly recommend this book if you want to cook fun things with young kids."
2,Can we stop the gender role crap?,"I'd probably buy this if not for the gender stereotypes. It's not always women in the kitchen. And before you ask, I wouldn't buy a ""Dad and me"" book either.There's plenty of cookbooks for kids out there, buy one instead that isn't reinforcing outdated gender roles."
4,Good Kitchen Fun,"I bought this book for myself and my dd. We made the chicken stir fry recipe and it was a huge hit. It had ketchup in the sauce (my dd normally won't even look at the stuff) but because she made the sauce she ate it without even complaining. The thing she liked best about the recipe (besides helping out) was the fact that it had baby corn in it, something she had never had before. She LOVED it! An excellent book to get kids involved in cooking and stop being picky!"
3,Quality Time Between Mom And Child,"Bought this for my 3 year old neice. She liked it. Her mom thanked me and I myself wrote a recipe for myself. This book is 48 pages of the most common recipes and also has ideas to make decorations. There is a recipe called ""Potato Mice"" which is essentially potatos shaped like mice. CUTE.It's a great big colerful book that your kids will love but more so the parents as they will get quality time with their son or daughter. Not only that, the book can be passed down for years to come."
3,An Okay Cookbook for Kids,It's okay but not quite as good as the Betty Crocker cookbook I bought with this. There aren't many recipes and they're really note too appealing. My granddaughter liked it though and that's all that matters.
4,Mom and Me Cookbook,"The book is a great book with good recipes for children, but it would be nice to know what the target age range is. My daughter is 10 years old and our family's thought is that we need a slightly more advanced children's recipe book."
5,Best children's cookbook I've seen,"This book has everything I'm looking for in a children's cookbook, and more. The key words are big and simple for kids who are just learning how to read. Each step and each item needed is illustrated with beautiful, fun and clear photographs. Even the table of contents is illustrated, making it easy for my daughter to pick a recipe. The recipes are simple and tasty. And my daughter and I both love the ""Mom and me"" aspect, because really, why else would I get a children's cookbook? (My daughter is much too young to be cooking on her own.) The edition at our local library is from England, so I had to look up some of the terminology; I don't know if the one Amazon is selling has been Americanized."
4,"Great gift for the little ""chef""!!","I bought this as a gift for my family members with children. Loved the photos and is very easy to follow. The kids LOVE it!! I added a chef hat and apron with the book for a personalized gift. I only wish the title wasn't ""Mom and Me"" but something that incorporates dad/partners for a more family friendly book."
3,Kind of disappointed.,I got this book based on some of the reviews but overall I was kind of disappointed. None of the recipes really stood out as terribly special.
1,Does she have an Editor?,"Like others who reviewed this book, I was looking for something like Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series or Donati's Wilderness series. I bought this hoping for a new series to read. Was I ever disappointed. Ms. Givens seriously needs a good editor. If she has one, they should be fired. The glaring errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation in this book distracted me from any enjoyment of the story. The story line is weak, the charaters shallow, and there is so much repetitious dialogue that seems intent upon just filling the page saying the same thing over and over and over... If you want an absorbing, enjoyable read - move on to something else and pass this one up."
3,Good story once you get past the typo distractions,"I have come to expect a fair amount of typos in free books. Sad but true, it is often the case. However, this is the first book I have paid more then a couple bucks for that had so many typos. It is not just a few, but rather, it is significant. Some are minor enough to barely notice. Others are major, such as the first word of a new paragraph just missing, or what should read as ""Alex"" being typed as NlXT. There were a few that were messed up enough that I was unable to even determine what the word was suppose to be. There were words missing, extra words and two words joined together rpeatedly. The sad thing is that it is a good read and an entertaining story. But I am very dissapointed to pay $8 for a book that cleary has not been edited at all. I would have purchased more of this author based on the story itself, but due to all the typos and mistakes, I most likely will not."
2,Misses the mark set by gabaldon/outlander series,"I read the kindle version. ridiculous amount of typos/editing errors. WOW. Even on the blurb @end where the title of next volume is misspelled. So, the book. Reads like someone who read outlander series when they were in high school, and now that they are in college, have been given assignment to write their own historical romance. Sure, she mentions the attraction between the main characters, but this woman is so shallow, it's hard to see how they fell in love. It seems like it's a paint by numbers version of outlander series to me. She endures three miscarriages, yet spends little time thinking about it. When Alex commits to join the uprising, we read her pleadings for him to stay for page after page. Not all that likeable, IMO. Her motivations are not explored, all Alex gets to say is ""I love you, lass"", sorry, won't be reading the next volume...."
2,Not what I'd hoped for...,"As a Gabaldon and Donati reader, I looked forward to reading this historical novel. There was no history. There was too much monotonous romance. The characters were flat and uninteresting after about 100 pages. I wish I hadn't bought the next book in the Kilgannon series when I bought this book. It read like a dime store romance novel."
5,A must read book,"Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. I am so excited and cannot wait for the sequel to come out. Everyone who enjoys reading about the Scottish people and their ways will love this book. I recommend it to everyone! Way to go Kathleen!!! Keep them coming. I will be looking for more."
2,Scottish Flirtation,"This is a historical romance, plain and simple, with below average dialog between the characters. There is good description of setting and the historical context of the times, but the plot is uninteresting. The main characters lack complexity and depth. I had enough interest to finish it, curious about one story line with a villainous brother, but there was no resolution. There was a set-up to read the next book in the series, which I have little interest to do."
1,cheap ripoff,"This book just seemed like a bad ripoff from the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon. It was boring and I had a hard time finishing it. I don't care about the characters because they are so one dimensional. Read the Outlander series if you want good writing, good stories and outstanding characters!!!"
3,So many typos...so little time,This book was clearly not edited. The typo's alone will make you go insane trying to figure out what is being said. The first 30% of the book is great and then it goes downhill. The author just repeats and repeats and repeats (see how annoying it is) the same lines and drama over and over again. She even repeats the heroine's miscarriages! I think she's on #4 miscarriage. I don't even know if I can finish it. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,A thoroughly good read.,"I picked this book up on a whim and am so glad I did. The characters are real and I never found myself questioning their thoughts or actions. You appreciate Mary's struggle to come to terms with life in the Highlands which is so different from her easy & boring life in London (before Alex came along). Alex is charming, funny and romantic. It's easy to see why Mary fell for him, he respects her mind and heart and never treats her terribly, as I've seen a lot in romance novels, man treats the woman horribly yet because he's attractive she puts up with it and falls in love. Mary is an intelligent woman with a good heart, she is very likable. It's a good book to curl up with on a rainy day."
3,A fair book,"For summertime reading, I searched for any Scottish historical romance to tide me over while I wait for the fifth installment of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. This seemed like one of the better ones. (I don't like your normal ""romance"" novels.) While this book was good, all along I felt it was a poor imitation of Diana's books. Although I liked the characters, I did not fall in love with them. I do suggest that you read this book, if only to be able to compare Kathleen's hamburger to Diana's filet mignon. (And we all have a taste for hamburger now and then, don't we?)"
3,Review from another Gabaldon fan,After completing this book and rereading the reviews they do relay the strengths that parallel this story to the Outlander series. Givens does a fine job writing about Scotland and London while moving the story quickly. The interaction in the society is believable and character development is good. A character map would help a little along with a sketch of the land for those of us who like to see it laid out. Where this book falls short is in the exchanges between Alex and Mary. She comes off as a emotionally immature London society girl after we've seen her embark on a new life in the Scottish highlands that in itself suggest bravery and growth of the character. Her emotion as the war approaches is understandable but the behavior by the character is the behavior of a child. Knowing this I think Gabaldon fans can enjoy this story since its sequel does sound worth reading.
2,"Ok story, full of typos","The story and plot are ok. The heroine is a bit self-centered and whiney. But the typos are an endless distraction. I expect better from a Kindle book. Really, they could have bothered to have a human edit it for grammar and spelling given the high price of online books."
1,two many typos..,the storyline was good and probably well written however the typographical errors were very distracting and made reading difficult
2,distracted by typos,"Although the story is interesting enough, there are so many typos that it has become frustrating to read.I can understand a misplaced hyphen once in awhile but there are quite a few here. I've noticed incorrect punctuation, too.If you don't mind reading lots of 'Tour' for 'Your' and 'I'D' and 'Pd' and 'I' d' then it's ok.It's too much money to risk ordering the second one. If it weren't for the fact that I'm reading it on an iphone (maybe that is the problem) I'd get out my red pen."
5,Kilgannon,"Kathleen Givens is an excellent author. I have enjoyed every one of her books. I had a hard time putting this book down and couldn't wait to read the sequel. She transports you back in time. It is a beautiful, well written romance."
5,A Page Turner,"Although this book was more romance than historical I enjoyed reading it very much. Kept me at the edge of my seat at times and was emotionally involving. I just bought the follow up book and am looking forward to continuing the story. I have also read the other series by the author and enjoyed those as well. I'm sad that she is gone and we will have no more of her books. My sympathy to her family and friends.I don't understand why there are so many errors in the book as far as spelling, spacing, punctuation etc. Surely the book was not printed with all these errors? It's not a big deal but can be very distracting as it takes away from the reader's enjoyment of the story."
2,What's with all the typos?,"Kindle versions often seem to have a lot of typos. What is the reason for that? Is a pre-final edit electronic version used? At any rate, this book has way more than the usual number of typos, so much so that some sentences make no sense at all. As far as content is concerned, I am disappointed. I have learned that there is a big difference between a historical novel (that features actual historical events) and a historical romance."
3,just not quite as good as it could be,"i loved diana gabaldon's outlander series. i was hoping to find another book/series that could match that one. not even close. this book is all sizzle and no steak. decent story, but not enough character development. the end was enough to send me off the deep end, all that whining by mary.......i did order the second book, hoping(since the reviews were better for that one), to like this series more.btw, the typos on the kindle are atrocious."
1,Technically flawed,"The performances on this CD were no doubt great, but the sound quality is terrible. I was totally disappointed. You are better off with Otis Spann's Live the Life if you want to hear him in top form along with some great Muddy Waters. Stay away from Collaboration unless you are a completist."
2,let down,"The book is beautiful. But I was looking for recipes that used mostly honey, maple syrup, or molasses. She loves using maple sugar and uses it in tons of recipes. I think maple sugar is too much like sugar and don't want to use it. I haven't made one thing yet because I don't have any of the things on hand to use."
1,Not really what I expected,The first thing it lists on the book is honey.... No there is very few recipes made with honey most of them call for other sugars that aren't refined and maple syrup. very disappointed.
4,"'If It Feels Good, Do It!","As the creator of this record,of course I am very proud of it. Asia Maya Zen is named after my Weimeraner who is now three. It was recorded in four weeks in Atlanta,Ga. and even features special guest Grammy-nominated Shawn Mullins on two songs,""Ride My Bike"" and Baby, Please Roll Down Your Window'. This music was inspired by a lifestyle dominated by making music and having a good time and is best described as high-spirited folk-rock. I hope you all enjoy it!"
3,Alright,For some reason I expected more from this CD. It doesn't particuarly stand out to me when I play it.
2,Heehee,"Listening to Cassandra butcher simple songs like ""Polkadots and Moonbeams"" makes me appreciate Stacey Kent all the more. If you can get through the quick sample of that song here ... without laughing, than her haphazard vocal style apparently more to your liking."
1,Be Great If It Worked,"Let's see. The first one arrived with a missing piece. Sent that back and replaced it. The second one went back because the hour hand was broken. Because it was completely loose, the clock wasn't even accurate twice a day. Howard Miller, you've got to do better."
2,"Dont buy, Crank 2 doestnot play","I bought this set. Crank 1 (Disc 1) was good, but Crank 2 (Disc 2). It had the same issue like other reviews (showing 2 inches square box)Thanks for Amazon's Customer Service Return policy."
2,Great but....,"It arrived in good condition and we enjoyed Crank until we put in Crank 2 and it seemed to default to play on TV screen within a 2inch by 2inch...after all the reset, checks etc., it still can't play properly. A little disappointed!"
2,"Movie's Entertaining, but Crank 2 Won't Play!","This may be a quirk of my new Sony BlyRay, but the Crank 2 disk hangs and won't play! I returned it to Amazon for a new set and same thing."
5,Crank/Crank2,"The funniest and most action packed series in Jason Statham's career so far, Very entertaining. I am looking forward to a possible Crank 3."
4,Pretty Good but...,"Movies were in perfect condition, but I had some problems getting Crank 2 to work. I read the reviews saying Crank 2 wouldn't work in the older blu ray players. But I just bought a new blu ray player a couple months ago, so I didn't think it would affect me. I was wrong, all I saw was a little 6x6"" picture on my screen, exactly how the other reviewers had described. Even though the comments suggested a firmware update, that was not the solution. I put it in my PS3 I bought in 07', which I havent updated since 09'. It worked perfectly in my PS3, It still pisses me off it wont work in my brand new blu ray player. But it works in my PS3 so it's not a problem for me. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The movie itself was pretty unbelieveable to the point it was dumb. But the violence and nudity more than made up for the bad story."
2,"Great Movie, But BD-Live Problems Galore","As far as the movies, these are two of the most fun movies you can possibly watch.As far as this product, it is a huge pain. If you google crank 2 bluray problems, you will come up with a slew of forum posts about it not working, because it has some sort of new java something or something with bd-live, I don't really know. However, it seems like to get it to actually play you need internet, a sd card or usb flashdrive and to accept some sort of eula agreement. Pretty ridiculous. I still can't get it to work. Crank 1 plays fine though.Hopefully a future update will help fix this."
1,Garbage BluRay Disc,"Got the 2 pack from Best Buy...Crank 2 - I don't even use BD-Live; yet they produced this so 2.0 version players require a minimum memory for this feature, and if you don't have it then you can't play this disc at all. Yet older players, that aren't BD-Live compatible, can play this no problem. I suggest getting the DVD if you really want this movie and just deal with the up conversion."
5,A nice tool!,"This is a nice, compact tool that I can carry with me on my bike tours. I tried it once to see how it works, and it feels sturdy and will probably last my lifetime. It is well made. Make sure you lubricate the threads to insure it works properly and lasts a long time."
3,overpriced,"Allen key constantly falls out of place! Also the tool only came with one pin, which I'm concerned will eventually break."
3,Too far.,"It works pretty well, and is fairly easy to use... but the first time I used this I pushed the pin out too far and gave up on trying to put it back in. It should have been engineered better to prevent this, as the design of the product suggested it would ""stop"" when the pin has reached it's furthest point. Just be aware of this when using it and it should be fine."
5,Topeak Super Bicycle Chain Tool,"Looks like a cheap piece of junk but works great. It get's the job done without any trouble. IT has little grooves for the chain to go in to make the process easier. Seems durable and works great, will update if there are complications."
2,Broke on First Use,"Rather than push out the pin in the chain link, the tool's pushpin sheared in half.I suspect that part may have been defective, though, and this review isn't a blanket condemnation of the Super tool or Topeak.The reason why is, I was able to complete the chain repair using the chain tool included in my Topeak Alien II multitool. No problem with that one. So Topeak can make a chain tool that works. I might have just gotten a bum pushpin in my Super.I bought the Super in the first place because I figured the chain tool in the Alien II would be flimsy. The Alien II chain tool was to be a backup, and it performed well.I'll probably replace this with the more expensive Park CT-3, though."
4,Works well for a travel model,"When I ordered this tool I thought it was more of a shop sized device. Nope. It's more like a tourist tool kit addition. Nothing against the tool, good value for the money, just not what I expected. It works much better than those bottom of the barrel, blocky silver colored things. I'll include a photo so you can judge the size complaint for yourself."
1,Warning! Formula Changed.,"I have been a devoted Clearly Natural unscented glycerin liquid soap user for the past 6+ years because I have severe sensitive skin and severe eczema. I can't use Dove, Ivory, Aveeno, any other soaps that I know of even if they are labelled as ""for sensitive skin""In Dec 2011, I ordered my yearly $60+ worth of Clearly Natural unscented glycerin liquid soap refills directly from Clearly Natural online and I broke out in hives and itches after one use of the new product.Old Formula: Water, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarconsinate, Potassium Oleate, Glycine.New Formula: Water, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, (OLEIC ACID), Glycerin, (ALKYL POLYGLUCOSIDE), (POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE), Sodium Chloride, glycine, (ALOE BARBADENSIS), (TOCHOPEROL ACETATE).Most people would most likely not react like I do to the new ingredients, but people should be aware that the formula has changed."
4,Well worth the money,"I purchased this cooler a few weeks ago. Since then I've used it 4 times and I've been pleased every time. The first time we used it was on our vacation. The cooler was filled with ice when we left and the ice lasted for a 9 hour drive on an extremely hot day with minimal melting. Upon arrival, the beverages were still nice and cold.I also used this for a family party. I filled the cooler with ice and three cases of water with room to spare. The cooler sat on the deck all afternoon and everything was still cold at the end of the day.The only downside to the cooler is the fact that it does get pretty heavy when it's full and there are no wheels. Something to consider if it needs to be moved alot. But, if it's used outside, there is a nice drainage spout so that would lighten the load a bit at the end of the day.All in all, I highly recommend the cooler."
5,Great Cooler,This is the best inexpensive cooler I ever purchased. I use it for fishing and it keeps the ice forever.
5,Chiller,"Not heavy or too expensive. Took it to the beach on a 90 degree day with a bag of ice, some sodas, some food. After three hours the stuff was still cold and the ice wasn't melted."
2,Note: no tray included,"Admittedly, the product description does not mention a tray. However, it was my (erroneous) assumption that coolers of this type included trays because they used to.The fact that it does not is a major deficiency in my view: a tray is extremely handy for separating smaller items; for keeping delicate items from being crushed by heavier items; and for keeping dry items high and dry.Surprisingly, Coleman's website does not indicate that a tray is even available as an extra cost accessory -- one I would purchase in a heartbeat.Equally surprising, my research indicates that other manufacturers don't include trays with their coolers any longer either. In the end, I returned this cooler and bought an Igloo at Costco and used the old tray I already had."
2,The worst of the series,This was the last and worst of the 3 releases. I have the 2nd one which is much better. You can tell they were really on a budget and out of great ideas on this one. I would pass.
4,Nice size. Overall good. You get what you pay for basically.,I thought the leather was a little cheap looking...the stitching kinda cheap too. Cheezy logo printed on lining and on outside silver lock. Made in China. It doesn't look like a $500 bag. It looks like the price you pay. I think it's durable and I like the feature where it can stay open. The opening is large and makes getting thingsin and out very easy. Good layout of compartments inside. Bottom line its more practical than good looking.
1,Take the information in this book with a grain of salt,TERRIBLE!!!Too many mistakes.Mr Hurd don't know the first thing about a correct Chevelle restoration.Too bad its the only Chevelle restoration book available.Stick to assembly manuals and original dealer books for your best source of information.This book don't cut it!!
3,What a mess!,The book is a bunch of notes without comprehensive organization. Models like '69 are insuficiently covered (but nice if you have a '71). This book can give you a hand but is very very limited.
1,Lots of misinformation,"Having restored a number of Chevrolets to showroom condition, I found Paul's book a sea of misinformation. Pictures with wrong dialog, incorrect and invalid part numbers and hard to decypher copy. Too bad this is the only book available for the Chevelle fan. You can actually get better info from the well-documented Camaro boys and probably be more accurate than what Paul is advising. If you use this book in your resto, take it with a grain of salt and double check your part numbers with the abundance of Chevelle web site info.This book sorely needs re-written... more carefully!!!"
2,The book tries to be too difinitive.,"The book is a broad and detailed manual covering the entire list of restoration steps and processes, but what the book fails to account for are manufacturing differences created by the various GM assembly plants. An example is that a 65 Chevelle model from the Kansas City plant will have more undercarriage parts painted than the car assembled at the Fremont, California plant. The book tends to state ""the part appears this way and this way only"" on a properly restored car and makes no accounting of mid-year changes or manufacturing location difference. I certainly hope this book is never used to judge concours Chevelle restorations.For the restorer wishing to learn great deals of general information about restoring a Chevelle, this can be a good reference tool, it just needs to be taken with a grain of salt not not used as the sole source of restoration information."
1,Look elsewhere for good info.,This book provided very little quality information. In several cases the information was either missing or incorrect.
1,There is not an original thought in this book.,The author of this book has accomplished nothing more than gathering a lot of GM service manuals photo copying the pages as they relate to all years of Chevelle and bound them up into a book. Where are the facory colors for various body componets and a good aftermarket match? For that matter how about some color photos in the book? Forget the book and go to the many on line Chevelle clubs for useful information. web pages and get the information.
1,Not Interesting,"Book is written in a blah fashion.A lot of pages but no color photos.If I had to do over,I wouldnt buy this book...Dennis"
5,wrong holster.,"I got this for my Rossi .38 special, but it was the wrong one, I spoke with the customer service and shipped it back for a refund, sadly they did not have the right holster for my six shooter."
1,Item never delievered,"My holster was never delievered nor were my E-Mails answered, this company is a rip off."
4,A close-up on the masterpieces,"For those who love works by the Peredvizhniki, or the ""Itinerants"", or the ""Wanderers"", or whatever they might have been called, THIS IS THE BOOK YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!Vasily Surikov has been an inspiration and the icon of Russian Realism, and through this wonderful publication one may understand how his works and his life intertwined with each other, through detailed studies of his masterworks like ""Morning of the Execution of the Streltsys"" and even ""Yermak's conquest of Siberia"". In fact, if i hadn't read this book i wouldn't have realised Surikov is a descendant of the Cossacks!If your thirst for Russian art doesn't stop here, check out Parkstone Press Great Painter's series for other Russian Masters, like Repin, Shishkin, Larionov and even the seascape master himself, Aivazovsky."
3,Great Russian Painter Surikov,"This book introduced main works by V. Surikov but reproduction on paper hardly reflect the main features of the painter's art. Surikov's paintings featured with large size, rough canvas, brave brush and strange and strong color, all of these are not reproduced in this book. But this book discussed his life in detail which will help those who needed the basic understanding of his life."
2,Movie that reads like a book,"I thought the movie was going to be higher octane. Really, it just meanders through two hours of Bah, Meh and boredom. Im not too familiar with serial killer Bunting, although Ive heard of him. The movie really tries to dig deep into the home lives and minds of the characters. How true it is to actual events who knows and who cares I just wanted to see the killings and that was lacking.I wish they had ended the film with the guys being caught and maybe showing some actual news reel footage of them being handcuffed and incarcerated for closure and authenticity, but instead they ended with subitltes. What a Jip. In the end, white trash families in Australia just dont do it for me."
5,Stranger,"I feel this was a very good book as it started with action, as most western books should to get the reader in the book. Than it just kept you in suspense and guessing what was to come next. Never sure what was going to take place."
3,"Alicia, but not quite Aretha.","As you know, Alicia Keys is a good singer/songwriter with many talents, but she is just not ready to try and pull of powerful soulful ballads, especially not remakes. Her voice sounds shrill, sparse and sometimes painful in this remake of Prince's 'How come you don't call me'. I think she should stick to the more modern sound at which she does best. Don't get me wrong, the combination of her & the Neptunes does spice this track up into a hot modern remake, but that's the way it should stay: a remake. Overall a good track that Alicia shouldn't try and reproduce, but should come out successfully because of the Neptunes version."
3,This book changed my life.,"Before reading this masterpiece, if it's indeed the book I'm thinking of, I viewed hammocks as a playful contraption for swinging and naps. Since reading, and making hammocks, I've comfortably joined the millions of humans who sleep primarily in hammocks. What better way could there be to sleep?"
3,It's just not good,"Very little information. Covers 5 methods of hammock styles. Gives 5 instructions, 1 for each style, on how to build the hammock. No fluff, but no detail either."
2,trial and error,"Admittedly, the problems I've had making a hammock with the aid of this book may be attributable human error (i.e. my own ineptitude); yet once I began ""following"" the instructions, I became increasingly frustrated by the vagueness of the book. I found myself making many errors and asking many specific questions which go unaddressed by the author. Expect to make many mistakes, prepare yourself to start over from scratch at least once, and pay no attention to the prices for which these hammock can supposedly be made - be prepared to spend a bit more."
3,Take caution before buying...,"I will also chime in having only read the excerpt.As a professional stage combatant, actor and fight choreographer, I cannot recommend this book. Based on the author's words, he seems to have learned the bulk of his skills by watching movies and then practicing what he saw with his friends. While there is nothing wrong with that, it's a great starting point (it's how I started). But by itself, it in no way qualifies you to teach!I also disagree with one of the author's premises. A professionally performed fight is choreographed from start to finish. A professional NEVER improvises a fight during a performance. This is how people get injured (I've seen it happen, it's not pretty).Now, I'm not saying there's nothing to learn from this book. Just don't expect to learn all you need to from it. No book, no matter how complete or easy-to-learn the subject matter, can ever replace a qualified instructor. Especially not in 56 pages."
3,"Um, excuse me?","Ok, I have never read this book, so please disreguard the star rating- it wouldn't let me post a comment without one- but I just want to counter the last review- anybody who thinks that learning stage combat from ANY book is just as safe and effective as studying from an experienced, learned instructor is somebody I would never want to do a show with!Useful or not, no book is going to make an unexperienced reader a qualified and safe stage combatant, any more than it can make someone an expert martial artist, licensed airline pilot, or a surgeon.Books can be great resources, but they're no substitute for training. That's all I've got to say about this right now."
4,Fuel Line clamps,"Clamps OK. I think cost was OK. Have not used yet. Quality is good, think clamps willl work fine OK."
5,How bad can they be,"They are good, did not bind, and have great staying power. I would not hesitate to buy these again. And for that price I doubt you would find better ones."
5,Exactly as ordered,"Seems to be a genuine toner, and not a knock off / refill. Great price. So far so good.Will update review if it gives any issues or runs out ahead of schedule."
4,John Wesley's Bullseye,"As with any collection of this type, there are gems, OK stuff, and less than stellar performances; the gems far outweigh the other here. Harding's deserved folk reputation shines through. If you like the imaginary compatriots on his dream song (Phil Ochs, Steve Goodman, Bob Dylan, David Blue) you will love this. If you don't you may very well love it anyway. There are some brilliant topical and love/love over songs. Like the gunfighter he almost shares his name with, there are many more hits than misses. And a bit of blood is shed."
4,An eclectic trip through many musical neighborhoods.,"Having lived with, and listened to, Hombres Calientes, Volume 2, for several months, I have come to the conclusion that the disc is like a subway car ride through many musical neighborhoods. After each cut, it is as though the listener re-enters the darkness, each time emerging to a different beat, style or rhythm. While not all of the tracks work, enough should catch your attention in a first listening to prompt you to go back and re-visit and experience. Soon, you may find yourself enjoying every stop on the route."
5,Absolutely Outstanding!,"This CD is definitely one of my absolute favorites. It is always one of the 5 cd's in my cd player and I have another copy for the car. This is truly inspired and ORIGINAL music. I'm lucky enough to live in New Orleans, so I can sometimes catch LHC live! Bill Summers (of HeadHunters fame) is a musical genius. LHC have a great international sound mixed with some true new orleans flavour! Irvin Mayfield has got to be the most talented young artist around. His style is really his own, and his compositions are original and moving. You don't have to think twice about this purchase. This CD is a MUST HAVE."
1,A big disappointment,"I went to see this group live in Houston last night and bought this CD before the concert started. Unfortunately, I should have waited till intermission and saved the $15 instead. Not knowing anything about Los Hombres Calientes I expected a true Latin Jazz group as advertised in their billing. Unfortunately this group does not have one ounce of Latin blood or spirit among them and it shows in this CD and their performance. One of the pieces they attempted last night was Mandinga, a great Cuban guaracha/son which they simply botched. Los Hombres Calientes must be trying to capitalize on the current popularity of Latin music, given their name and billing, however they should call themselves The Hot Men and play New Orleans jazz instead, a genre better suited for their style. If you want to listen to a real Mandinga, buy the Ruben Gonzales version on World Circuit."
4,Very Interesting Book,"Very interesting book. The stories are outrageously intense. The editors closing statement must be kept in mind when reading. These stories come from submissions to a male bondage magazine. Nonetheless, it is still super interesting."
1,"Too expensive, Buy 42-count instead","For 64 count, cost/diaper= 14.99/64=$0.23If you buy 42 count, thencost/diaper=$0.18So, I would not buy this MEGA size, because it's moreexpensive."
5,"LOVE THEM, much better then huggies",Using these w/ my son the delivery always stays in the diaper. Can't say the same for HUGGIES!!
5,"A classic album of rage, wit, pain, and pleasure","Sometimes I hate rock critics but without them, I never would have heard of this masterpiece. This album has so much heart, it puts most rock music to shame. There aren't many artists who can switch from raging at God one minute to sadly longing for a lost love the next, and then throw in how great it is to put on some cool shoes. How could you not love an album with lines like, ""I feel like I've been livin' to die, but when that rhythm plays, I don't know how to cry""?"
5,Graham Parker at his splenetic best,"Poor Graham Parker! His angry brand of pub-rock got overtaken by the punks, who made him seem not angry enough and suspiciously attached to Motown, r&b, and the blues. He also paid a dear price for his faint vocal resemblance to Elvis Costello, whom he actually preceded. Anyway, this record is a killer: great songs, passionate singing, and some sublime, beer-soaked support from the Rumor. Check out Brinsley Schwartz's lead guitar on ""Don't Ask Me Questions,"" or the endearing horn charts on ""Silly Thing,"" or Graham's cantankerous vocalizing on the dobro-driven ""Not If It Pleases Me."" This one will still sound fresh in the year 2525--if man is still alive and sporting those aviator sunglasses Graham always wears. What color are his eyes, anyway?"
5,my 8 year old gets it,Howlin' Wind is just about as good as a rock album gets. No serious collection should be without this album. You don't have it? You've got to be kiding!
2,...Blowin' away autumn leaves,"This CD sounds like a bunch of leftover demos, ultimately rejected by artists like Van Morrison (""White Honey""), Randy Newman (""Lady Doctor""), Bob Dylan (""You've Got To Be Kidding""), and Elvis Costello (""Nothin's Gonna Pull Us Apart"").Super Producer Nick Lowe does what he can with depressing material; he even enlists buddy Dave Edmunds to play some Scotty Moore-type licks on the bright ""Back To Schooldays"", which should have closed the album.My edition does not have the Bonus Cut, but the sample available did not cause me to add a half-star.Parker certainly is a pioneer in New Wave/ Progressive Punk, but lyrics are paramount for the uninitiated, as his singing voice is just serviceable to the words; here they are not going to break any new ground."
5,Howlin Wind,"I have to agree with the only other person who took the time to review this album. The over hyped and over produced bands seemed to get the ink while bands like Graham Parker and the Runour just produced great music and were great live. Elvis Costello was receiving great reviews and deservedly so, but Graham Parker was right there with him. Howlin Wind covers the full spectrum from rockabilly to the blues and this was definitely one of the best albums of 1976. Heat Treatment was the follow up and it wasn't far behind Howlin Wind. People from the Capital District in upstate New York are extremely lucky. Graham Parker resides close by and we're fortunate that he plays locally with some of the areas talenteed musicians and whether solo or with others he never disappoints.Kevin Burns"
5,One of the greatest debut albums ever,"Many people consider Parker's 1979 gem ""Squeezing Out Sparks"" to be his finest work. While I agree that SOS is an excellent album, I find it a bit too mechanical and forced, especially when compared to Parker's stunning ""Howlin' Wind."" This album is pure Parker, combining the snarl of Elvis Costello with the blue-eyed soul of Van Morrison. There are so many great classic GP songs here. The opener, ""White Honey,"" is a classic...then there's the aching beauty of ""Gypsy Blood,"" the Stones-inspired ""Soul Shoes,"" the haunting title track...it's just a wonderful album all around. If you love flawless, inspired rock and roll, it doesn't get much better than this."
4,good video,"this is a good video if you like this kind of shows. it may not be for everyone. I like it, but I know it will offend some people. it is of X rated material. this is due to nudity in it."
5,Like a cross between Crocodile Hunter and Walking with Dinosaurs,"We've got the entire Walking With collection, and this has the same high standards. In most films or TV shows that have humans interacting with dinosaurs, the dinosaurs seem as obsessed with eating humans as the coyote was with eating the roadrunner. This dvd is more realistic- the predators want to eat whatever will give them the most food for the least risk, so while there is an element of danger, it's not as likely to induce nightmares as Jurassic Park."
4,A Safari set millions of years ago,"Nigel Marven has a time machine? Well, for this series he does! He travels back to the time of the dinosaurs for the safari of a lifetime!My Son is a HUGE Dinosaur nut, and he loved this series. Nigel travles to many different time periods to see many different kinds of dinosaurs. The show is split into 6 segments, that run about 30 minutes a piece, so you can take your time and watch a few at time if need be, or you can kick back and watch em all in one shot.If you liked Walking with Dinosaurs, but wished there had been a crazy wildlife adventurer pointing things out, then this is the dvd for you!"
3,My whole family loved this,"This is one of those DVDs you can enjoy time and time again. We bought this for our two children but we enjoy it as much as they do. My four year old absolutely loves it and has learned so much from the program. He can now name most of the dinosaurs and reptiles featured in the show on sight and will politely correct his playmates when they mistakenly refer to a Diplodocus as a Brontosaurus! The host, Nigel Marvin, has that charming british style that definitely makes this DVD a top shelf addition to anyone's collection."
4,Fun & Educational!,"The animatronics and CGI look really good on this show! I was very surprised at their quality! It is a little cheesy at times, but overall it's very fun and educational! Although I might add that the dinos do eat each other and get hurt, so it might be a little too much for the younger kids!"
4,Entertaining dino film,"The film is interesting and we love how we get to see the size of these beasts when he drives his jeep all around them. What I kind of get tired of is that it goes back and forth, regarding footage of the dinos and him. I guess I prefer the ""Walking With..."" series. Nevertheless, this film is very good. My 5 year old and I enjoy it!"
4,Entertaining and informative,"After the success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park movies, there has been an explosion of documentaries on dinosaurs and prehistoric life in general. BBC was one of the studios that really capitalized on this, especially wit their Walking With Dinosaurs series. Part of this is the Chased by Dinosaurs episodes, which is 2.5 hours long, 1.5 hours of which is the Chased by Sea Monsters miniseries. Starring in all of them is Nigel Marven, who adds a touch of British humor to the science and action of the show. A nice feature on this DVD is the special features, which shows how paleontologists discovered that the big carnosaurs were pack hunters. The show does deliver on entertainment value, with great CGI, lots of scenes of predators eating prey, and minimal screentime of humans narrating. Overall, great fun for the whole family."
5,Kept My Kids Happy for Many Hours!,"OK, I""ll be right upfront! I only ordered this because I wanted free shipping & it took me over the amount I needed and my son loves dinosaurs so I figured that it might be worth the money. Instead, it has become one of the most-watched DVD's in our collection. The action is exciting & realistic, the dinosaurs are unbelievably real (my son thought they were real & wanted to know where Nigel had gone to film them!) and the entire family enjoyed watching it. It's fascinating to see how scientists make interpretations about the dinosaur's lifestyles based on tiny clues in the fossils & by comparing them to modern animals. I can't recommend this one enough! I would not let little kids watch it (3 & under--some of the action sequences are very scary & would probably cause nightmares)."
2,Nigel ruined this DVD and I was hoping he would get chomped,"Nigel Marven might be a nice guy but to try to play off that he's actually there in real time as the dinosaurs really destroyed the DVD.I loved Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Prehistoric Beasts. Walking with Cavemen was still watchable and this one could have been cool had they removed Marven.Why change something that worked so well? We want to watch the dinosaurs, not Nigel. Trying to play off that Nigel and his film crew were there with the dinosaurs in real time was nothing more than an Ego trip for Nigel or a way to get by having any kind of entertaining story that the other aforementioned series.I got so bored with listening to Nigel talk that after a while I fast forwarded to when they finally introduced the dinosaurs and sea monsters.Worst of the 4, I recommend either skipping it or have your remote ready to fast forward when Nigel starts to ramble."
2,Chased By Dinosaurs,"I find the episodes Land of Giants and The Giant Claw with having Nigel Marvin in these two series dull and a real disappointent, I give them two thumbs down.I even find the chased by Sea Monsters dull I also give it two thumbs down.I've noticed there is a pterosaur called Ornithocheirus in Land of the Giants and a Liopleurodon in Chased By Sea Monsters, and I perfer those two in Walking With Dinosaurs.TO THE BBC CREATORS OF THESE SERIES WHEN YOU READ MY REVIEW I RECOMEND IN THE FUTURE IF YOU PLAN TO MAKE MORE WALKING WITH DINOSAURS AND BEFORE THE DINOSAURS WALKING WITH MONSTERS SERIES PLEASE HAVE ALL OF THEM BE NARRATED BY KENNETH BRANAGH BECAUSE I FIND THESE SERIES BEING NARRATED BY KENNETH BRANAGH IS TEN TIMES MORE BETTER."
5,Awesome,"My six year old son can't get enough of this DVD. We don't have cable so we don't get to watch these great shows on TV when they actually debut.This is fun, exciting, and sparks the imagination of not only the little one in our family. Nigel Marvin is great and the special effects are wonderful. After watching this DVD when we rented it, we went to the BBC website and played games that had to do with this program. It was lots of fun and we got to catch sea monters of our own.If you or your little ones love dinosaurs and creative shows, this is the one for you. Money well spent. A good investment for both entertainment value and educational value as well."
5,Great!,"This thrilling DVD was a joy to watch. Nigel Marvin is great, and his filmed ""adventures"" in time seem extremely real. I had to sometimes tell myself that this was all scripted and not real. Amazing effects and good ""acting"" on Nigel's part really made you feel that way. I highly recommend this DVD, and would like to see more made. Let's hope if this happens, Nigel will return, and not be replaced by someone extremely irritating and dim-witted like Steve Irwin, a.k.a the ""crocodile hunter""."
5,Kindergarteners can't get enough of this video!,"This is another outstanding DVD in the Walking With Dinosaurs series. Nigel Marvin, the host and time traveler, is instantly likeable and the graphics are amazing as in all the Walking With videos. There are creatures in this video that I had never heard of before, especially in the feature on Most Dangerous seas. My 5 yr old twin boys and their friends watched this video over and over and over again. Even after owning it for 10 months, they still want to watch it."
5,Belongs in Every Dino DVD Collection,"Man, this stuff is so great. My kids really like these 'chased by' DVD's and the critters are so realistic you almost forget that they're not. All I can say is that if you like wildlife shows hosted by biologists, and you like dinosaurs, you will love this. I'll get every one they come out with."
5,Interesting mix of prehistory and adventure,"Use this DVD to complete your Dino-dinasty database. Although at first this movie sounded too fantasious, it ended up being a very rich resource material! Some dinos have not been previously depicted in the other series, there's fresh material here. Very accurate and with excellent effects."
3,Entertaining and fairly interesting...,"I wasn't disappointed. Ever since The ""Crocodile Hunter"" made the scene, there have been others that have chosen this tack in order to present their material. I do find it amusing, but sometimes annoying to see it done with extinct creatures as though they were alive and under study. Still,showing animals in that light has proven to create more of an interest in them. On the plus side, the choice of creatures is unusual in the fact that the best known make way to showcase others that were equally spectacular, but not so well known, broadening the range of extinct species.The effects are from the ""Walking With"" Series and so are well displayed and fairly real looking.So, if one can stick a tongue firmly in cheek and suspend disbelief, this Ancient safari may be worth a look.."
1,Dual Discs are horrible,"Talking Heads are great, but the Dual Disc format is really really lame. The Dual Disc is to thick to work on every CD player/CD drive. I tried it on my PC and it works some of the time and never on my laptop. It does work all the time in my dvd player and normal cd player. It works in my car but has trouble being ejected all the way (because of the thickness). If you are going to buy a dual disc I would suggest trying to make a copy to a normal disc ASAP, if you can. I don't understand the use for this format. If they want to include DVD audio/ video extras just put it on an extra disc. Also one side of the disc is always exposed so scratches can pile up real quick. The Dual Disc format is just not worth the hassle. 0 for dual disc format, 5 for Talking Heads."
5,Fantastic,"My favourite Talking Heads album. This is a real gem that deserves more adoration than it gets.Thank You For Sending Me An Angel, The Girls Want To Be With The Girls, The Good Thing, Take Me To The River and With Our Love are my favourite tracks."
3,"Great material, flawed packaging","I HATE DIGIPAKS! If I had known that this disc would come in a digipak, I would never have purchased it.5 stars for the material, zero stars for the cursed digipak."
4,"Rethink this album, try 5.1 mix!","I didn't know how different the 5.1 mix for this album would be, but Harrison has done an able job. ""Thank You for Sending Me an Angel"" just leaps out of the speakers, more exciting than it's ever been. Other highlights are ""Found a Job"" and the angular ""Artists Only"". Snatch up these 5.1 mixes while they're still available."
1,Not anxious to own another Mark Bittman book...,"Frankly, I'd hesitate to order any new book by Mark Bittman after owning ""How to Cook Everything."" ""How...Everything"" should be titled, ""How To Cook Everything If You Already Know How To Cook Everything."" I am classically trained and a professional pastry chef. I can't name a recipe from this book that worked without major tweaking. After the first two recipe failures, I began to look at each subsequent recipe I considered with a trained eye and if it didn't make sense to me, I abandoned it. The inexperienced home cook would not be able to recognize these inconsistencies. I'd go with ""The Joy Of Cooking"" especially if experience is limited. It covers everything, has a wealth of additional cooking information, and the recipe yields are manageable."
2,Nothing Special,"This cookbook just doesn't do it for me. One of the most important things about a cookbook, to me, is how ""reader-friendly"" it is. Are the recipes easy to read and follow? Will I be able to keep my place as I whip around the kitchen? I just don't like the feel of this cookbook. The font is too small and is not conducive to my method of cooking with a book. I read through it all and tried the coconut chicken which was okay - nothing great. I just can't get into this book. Does anyone want to buy my copy?"
4,Please help a non-cook,"This isn't a review as much as a plea to people who own this book for honest help. I've bought enough cookbooks that are supposed to have easy recipes only to discover pages of ingredients and instructions plus ingredients I've never heard of and will probably never use again. Additionally, I suffer from rosacea, so standing in a hot kitchen which, incidentally, faces west, does me in rather quickly. I'm tired of frozen dinners no matter how good (if that's possible) and would appreciate e-mail heading me to a good cookbook that isn't exotic (like the microwave book I bought teaching me how to cook brains and tongue). I'm just squeamish, but I do appreciate fruits and vegetables. I'm not a vegetarian. Sorry. I like a good steak, tacos, etc. Thanks. P.S. I couldn't write this review without rating the book."
4,Wonderful book for people with little time to spare,"This cookbook has provided me with a few extra oompfs of inspiration in the kitchen when I'm making dinner after a very tiring day at the office. Sometimes I'm exhausted and I want to cook, but I don't want to get into a recipe whose ingredient list is a page and a half long (let alone have to do the cleanup for one afterwards!) Most of Mark's recipes are sweet, simple and to the point. I've enjoyed some of the suggestions for add-ins at the end of the recipes. They've worked out quite well and have even inspired other add-ins of their own."
4,"Fast, easy & delicious","For any 9 to 5 person, how can you beat a cookbook with easy, fast, minimal easy ingredients? I collect these kind of recipes and am delighted to find a collection in a cookbook by a well respected author."
4,the most useful cookbook I've bought in 10 years,"I've picked up a lot of cookbooks over the years and put them down when I realize the authors think I'm interested in committing HOURS to making dinner, or that I have a two page list of ingredients ready and waiting in the pantry.All culinary excellence aside (see below) these recipes give a clear idea of prep time, cooking time, and interesting substitutions. In the year that I've owned this book I've made at least 30 recipes from it. None have been too tricky for my low-to-middling skills, and none have given me an ugly surprise. That is commendation enough!However, lest I leave this book with that pale recommendation, let me say that Bittman is endlessly interesting; I've learned a lot from him, especially from the suggested substitutions after each recipe. If you like a recipe one way, he offers ingredients to toy with - other meats to try the same spices on and other spices to substitute."
3,I Misunderstood the Title,"This book disappointed me a bit, so I'd offer a dissenting view from the others who enjoyed it.From the title, I took this book to be a ""quick, easy, tasty meals that you can whip up after work"" book -- for me, however the ingredients were not always those that I usually keep and the techniques required some attention to detail (not a tremendous amount, but some) and not somthing that you can make up when you're tired and hungry. If you buy this book, you may want to keep this in mind."
2,Small.........,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this is small and hard to stretch over the toilet seat, but I did get it to fit. It also doesn't really match the ivory rugs I bought."
2,Just doesn't fit!!!,"Bought this to match two bathmats that I'd bought. But no matter what I do, the darn thing won't fit! So while it matches, the darn cover spends all it's time halfway down the seat. REALLY IRRITATING!!!!!!"
1,Don't waste Your Money,"Had the machine for 1 week, left pedal bolt sheared. This machine is a counterfeit ""Orbitrek"", same design with same flaws. No numbers included for parts and warranties."
2,You get what you pay for!,I ordered this flag with high hopes after reading the reviews. I was mildly upset with the amount of time it took to receive the product (8 days). The overall sewing of the flag is ok. However the flag is super thin. DO NOT EXPECT FLAG TO LAST LONG OUTDOORS. I personally bought the item to hang in my bar area but after Recieving the flag and seeing the quality ill let the item sit unopened in my closet.
3,The rising sun,"I got this as a gift for my 7 yr old who loves anything related to WW2. The flag was ok for what I paid but there was a red stain on the flag about a half inch wide and 6 inches long, it looks like the colors ran when the flag was made. My son didnt mind and wanted to keep it. Overall I was happy and he was too."
1,Worst brand of bakeware on the market,AirBake products are horrible! I have used the cookie sheets multiple times and I have had nothing but problems. There products over-brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans. I have better luck using my old cheap non-stick bakeware than AirBake. Buyer beware! If you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature.
2,Bake Quickly but HOT,"I've made 2 batches of Alton Brown's Choc Chip recipe on these since I bought them several weeks ago. I use parchment paper and wipe the pans off with soapy water between uses; I don't plan on trying them in the dishwasher, though it says you can.PRO: I love the 12x14-inch size. I do 2 pans at a time, rotating halfway through, and this size is easy to manuever and probably fits any oven.CON: These get so hot I can hardly handle them w/ regular oven mits. Cookies bake quickly, but you have to get used to how quickly and even adjust time for subsequent batches as the pans get hotter.I am not an experienced baker, but I assume being able to control baking time would be better. I plan to keep these, but I wouldn't buy insulated cookie sheets again."
3,Cookie sheet,"Cookie sheet arrived dented in two places. I didn't return it because I can still use it, and didn't want the hassle. However, when packing the sheet with other items, perhaps more care needs to be taken to protect the sheet."
2,Used to be better,"I've owned several of these pans over the years, and always loved them. I recently purchased two more of this size, and they are awful. Both of them warp when they are in the oven, to the extent my cookies turn into ovals. Worst of all, the bottoms of anything I put on the pans is always raw! And yes I know it's the pans because I still have an old one of the same type and size that does not warp, or bake unevenly. I have no idea what's causing the problems with the new pans, but it's bad enough I've decided against purchasing anymore airbake pans."
5,Washing,My husband drilled a very small hole in the underside corner of my cookie sheets. That way I could submerge the sheets in water and then just let them drip dry with the corner down. Sometimes I squeeze it a little bit to get out the majority of the water.
5,The cover of the book reached out to me!,"The grace and power of a horse and rider performing in an equestrian event is a pleasure to see. This story combines a love story between two unlikely people who come together,not without a big push from some friends, with their main goal,to showcase a specially bred horse with a rider than can help him reach his potential on the circuit.Caleb is a vet and part owner of Orion, and Cassie is the young,but very experienced rider who encounter roadblocks in their quest for success. This is a well written story, with wonderful characters and dialogue, a book you won't want to put down. If you love horses and romance, this will not disappoint you!!"
2,yikes,"i was really enjoying this book, but some of the romantic scenes were far too much for me. i wish they had content rating with books like they do with movies! i'm offended by such graphic romantic explanations. if you don't mind that, then you'll like this novel with lots of pretty horse scenes involved as well."
3,A nice read.,"This is a light romance with some good elements. The characters are fairly strong and believable. The plot was a mildly interesting tale of a girl and her new-boyfriend's ex-wife's horse. You follow? No? Well, the lovely horse that seems to be the lynchpin for the whole story actually belongs to the hero's vindictive ex-wife. The best part of the story, however, was the brother. I hope that Ms. Moore has plans to write his story, because I would very much like to read that one.All in all, if you can find it used here on Amazon, buy it. If not, well, you're missing a mildly fun way to pass a little time. If you want some good books of the type, however, you might want to try Michelle Martin's ""The Long Shot"" or if you like a little suspense, ""Hunter's Moon"" by Karen Robards is absolutely wonderful."
2,"Disappointing, Mediocre","Poor Jeff - he has to live in the shadow of his father, Michael Shaara, who wrote the excellent novel Killer Angels. I thought Jeff did a good job with his civil war novels, and ok with the WWI novel.This book is not exciting. The author gives the reader a long (over 100 pages) background of WWII. I do not think that is needed - who but WWII buffs are going to read this? That makes all of the background history unnessary. When you finally do get into the dialogue between the characters, it is two dimensional and reveals nothing new. I think the author should challenge himself and the reader providing something unique.As other reviewers have pointed out, there are technical errors in the book as well, which means you have to take that aspect of the book with a grain of salt - so why bother?Don't believe me - take it from the author himself - he says in his own introduction, what can he possibly add to all that has already been written about WWII? Indeed, Jeff, good question."
1,Gets old REAL fast,"Okay Jeff Shaara, we get it. Your opinion is that everyone in WWII spent most of their time bitching about one thing or another. That's fine. But it's just plain boring when your ""characters"" begin sounding exactly the same over the course of a book(except Patton who says ""Damn it!"" more often)."
2,As much fun as reading an outline.,"I was disappointed in this book. The cover art is inviting, but the prose is dull and predictable. I am a WWII buff, but I started looking forward to the next book on my to-read list a dozen pages into this tome. Historical figures like George Patton, Churchill, Eisenhower and Irwin Rommel deserve better than they received at the hands of Jeff Sharra."
2,Rising Tide -- Falls,"Shallow. Definitely lacking in any sort of history: political, military, sociological or human. Page after page of insidip dialog and ruminations, often by characters only obliquely related to anything having to do with WWII, Torch or the basic nature of armed conflict.A great idea to create an inside look at Torch and the early history of WWII, but it didnt happen in this book."
2,"No Warts, Please",This book was disappointing to me. I have never read a more sanitized novel about WWII.
2,Not as good as his others,"I'm a big fan of all of Jeff's other books. I think he has gotten better with each book that he's written. That trend ended here. Unfortunately, I believe the reason was a tactical error. What made his other books so good where the portrayal of the war and hardship that the protaganists had to experience. By choosing to spend so much time on Eisenhower and other generals, there just wasn't anything exciting or riveting happening. He spent too much time dealing with planning and not enough time on the experiences of the men."
5,The Rising Tide,"I've read all of Mr. Shaara's books and found them enjoyable, but, being a WWII buff I found The Rising Tide to be my favorite. It is well written and historically accurate with some interesting characters that are not historically based. The main point I would like to stress is to be certain to read the introduction, for it is the most concise and clear explanation as to the causes of the war that I have ever read. I believe this book should be required reading in American History classes, for the introduction if for no other reason."
3,"Good History, Marginal Fiction","I enjoyed learning, for the first time, this part of WWII history, particularly the often painful development of US combat capability and experience in the face of hardened Wermacht veterans. But the fictional narrative didn't pull me into the story too well. I enjoyed the tactical level stories from the fighting man's point of view much more than I did the various strategic or operational level stories from the general's or politician's point of view. Bottom line is that it took me a long time to read this book and was tempted at a few points just stop reading it all together."
4,The Americans enter Africa,"'The Rising Tide' is the first book in a trilogy covering World War II. This first book covers the American entrance into the Europena theater with the invasion of North Africa. The book covers the Africa compaigns and ends with the invasion of Sicily.I am a big reader of history, fiction and non-fiction. I like Jeff Shaara's style, which is similar to his father's. I do think that Michael Shaara's 'The Killer Angels' was the best of the group of these books. I have read Jeff's books on the Civil War and WWI. I found the two Civil War books to be a let down after 'The Killer Angels'. However, I enjoyed 'To The Last Man' and 'The Rising Tide' very much.'The Rising Tide' offers some insight to the hurdles placed in front of Rommel, which hinder him from invading Eygpt. We also see the difficult political dance the Eisenhower had to deal with to satisfy all of the Allies. I am looking forward to the next installment."
3,Shaara Fan,"This may not be Shaara's best work, but it's still very good. Rising tide does a decent job of telling the story of the North Africa campaign. The book culminates with the invasion of Sicily and the Italian mainland. As usual Sahara's characters are authentic and interesting. Definitely worthwhile. I'm looking forward to the future volumes in the WWII series."
5,Good read,I'm in the middle of this book and am really enjoying it. It's a vivid and riveting story. He seems very sympathetic to poor Rommel not getting the support he needs from the sycophants around Hitler.
4,The Rising Tide,Excellent insight as to how General Eisenhower was able to conduct the WW11 North African Camaign during the very beginning of the war in the African/European theaters. His handling of political and military matters conerning the French of North Africa are unmatched by any of our great leaders. JEFF SHAARA was able to point this out from beginning to end.
3,"Rommel, the great, the only","Rommel, Rommel, Rommel, Rommel, Ike, Rommel, Rommel, private someone, Rommel,Rommel, Patton, Rommel, Rommel.And it's not just that we get never-ending coverage of Rommel, it's that he was so put upon! No air support, not enough supplies, no reinforcements, not enough gas, no new tanks, no support from his superiors (who are all idiots because, well, they are not Rommel), dealing with a crazy Hitler, suffering fools all day, not having free reign to do whatever he wants whenever he wants.C'mon!Also, I have little confidence in the historical accuracy of this historical novel. I have read three or four books about Patton, including Carlo D'este's comprehensive biography.Patton: a Genius for War. Shaara seems to base his presentation of Patton solely on the movie-which is not that historical."
2,A big step backwards,"I've enjoyed every Shaara novel until this one. In his Civil War novels, Lee, Jackson, and others were real three dimensional characters with unique voices, and the pace of the writing changed in tense battle scenes.Now he's adopted a breathless writing style using compound sentences continuously, regardless of the tension. He even uses them in the dialog which makes every character and the narrarative all sound alike.It feels like the work of a research team, not a novelist."
4,Shaara Brings WWII Alive,"Shaara's account of the war in Northern Africa and the invasion of Italy revolves around several key historical characters (Eisenhower, Patton, Rommel) and one or two grunts, and gives the reader an up-close and personal experience of actually being there. He deftly weaves fact with fiction and in so doing, presents a clear and compelling picture of warfare. Like W.E.B. Griffen he takes us inside the minds of generals and sergeants trying to conquer their fears as they seek to defeat their adversaries. Shaara, like his father, is an outstanding writer about war and this novel is head and shoulders above most others of its kind. The reader will come away richly entertained and much much smarter about what went on in the early days of America's involvement in WWII."
4,Historical accurate novel,I feel that Shaara did an excellent job interweaving historical accuracy with fiction. The story takes place during the North African Campaign and the invasion of Sicily during WWII. The author takes WWII history and uses fictional dialogue and some fictional characters to bring history to life. I very good read for those who are WWII history buffs.
3,An Entertaining Book,"This is the first book of a trilogy about WWII. The book explores the lesser known African campaign(s) which began in late1942. Mr. Shaara goes into the minds of such military greats as Eisenhower, Montgomery and Rommel as well as other generals and even the men in the field. The story moves chronologically to the shores of Italy and beyond following the day-to-day events through different eyes, as is the Shaara style.Even though not of Mr. Shaara's best work, I still enjoyed this book keeping in mind that it is ""historical fiction"" (and so should you). This is an entertaining book but certainly not a historical one and I think Mr. Shaara did not do justice to some of the character development as he did in several of his previous novels.You don't have to be a history buff to love it because..it's not history but ""historical fiction"". If you're buying this book hoping for a history lesson you are better off buying the engaging WWII books by Stephen Ambrose et al."
3,Entertaining but not fully satisfying,"Jeff Shaara does a fine job entertaining us with details of the Allied WW II Africa campaign and all. Patton, Romell, Eisenhower... these and other famous names come to life and added much to my knowledge. Shaara's research appears thorough. But somehow this book just wasn't quite the ""page-turner"" (the kind of book you can't put down) as some of his other books--or other WW II books by other authors. I failed to be fully drawn in. There were good descriptions of men caught in smokey battlefields, but not of their fears; good explanations of each leader's responsibility, but not of the bravery that enabled him to fulfill it (though Shaara comes closest with Rommel). I'm enough of a Shaara fan to await the next in the trilogy. Again, the book greatly added to my factual knowledge of this part of the European campaign. But it wasn't a five-star read."
2,"Good, but not great","(review by her husband)The Rising Tide is Jeff Shaara's first part of a WW II Trilogy. Having enjoyed both his Civil War and Revolutionary War histories, I looked forward to his approach to this conflict. Unfortunately, the book lacked the spark that Shaara imparted to his earlier writings. Herman Wouk did it better in his set."
3,Not his best,"This is at the lower end of the table for Shaara, who can be pretty good and pretty bad.His problem is trying to get into the heads of historical figures who still are pretty contemporary _ Eisenhower in particular, but also Rommel and the other Germans. Shaara's WWI novel was successful because most of those characters are pretty far removed from contemporary life. His Civil War novels the same, although he has never reached the level his father did in ""The Killer Angels,'' perhaps the best novel ever written on that conflict (no, ""Gone with the Wind'' isn't close.)In fact, for a better take on the same subject, look to Rick Atkinson's ""The Rising Tide,'' a nonfiction account of the war in North Africa by a Washington Post reporter/West Point grad. It's supposed to be the first of a three-part series, although I heard it was delayed by Atkinson's work in Iraq."
3,Rising tide,As in the succeeding book the introduction - which should be historically accurate - contains numerous mistakes the least one being where the author calls Rommel a Bavarian (I do hope that no Swabian reads the book because he surely would blow his top). The novel itself is impressive as it seems to describe the combat situations very realistically. The characters descriptions sometimes seem to be overdrawn and exaggerated.
3,Good but there is better out there,"Shaara's Rising Tide is best when the characters are ones that actually lived rather than the ones he makes up. The dialogue between the historical figures is Shaara at his best. It is however unfortunate that he has chosen to write a fictional account of the war in north Africa when there is better to be had. Rick Atkinson's true - not fictional - account beginning with ""An Army at War "" and then ""Day of Battle"" is much much better. Here truth is better than fiction. If you like Shaara you will love Atkinson."
5,The Tradition Continues,"Jeff Shaara is masterful in his writng and this book was hard to put down.It offered insights into Eisenhower, Patton, and Rommel that many historical books miss or expound too much. Mr. Shaara did not leave out the fighting men, focusing also on a member of a tank crew and and infantryman. Well done...can't wait for the next installment"
3,Moves with the speed of heat,"It took me five months to read this book. Although I truly did enjoy learning about Rommel, Eisenhower, Patton and other notable figures, I found the going slow and very tedius. In contrast, with less than 100 pages to go in Shaara's book, I picked up Steven Pressfield's latest offering, ""Killing Rommel,"" and finished it in a single night. While Pressfield's book moves at the speed of light, Shaara's moves at the speed of heat; if you live in Alaska, you know that's not very fast, particularly on a frigid winter's night."
3,The cats are better but these are good for little kids,These kittens are okay. They don't do hardly anything but their good for little kids. I'm so SHOCKED that they would be selling these for $119. I go mine for $13 which I thought was too much. These are like $5-7 if you rate them but $10 won't be horrible either. Oh well. These are okay but there is better if you're older.
2,"2.5, maybe. Bland Brazilian pop","Yeesh. Tepid, dispiriting rerecordings of some old ""brega"" (""tacky"") pop songs. Diniz sounds very old and tired on these recordings; the musical accompaniment is fairly uninspired. You should avoid this recording and look for the original 1960s/'70s versions instead (if you must...)"
5,Perfect for moms.,"This is a great bag for mom's, I got it for my daughters birthday and she absolutely loves it. Instead of using the yoga straps for a yoga mat she carries around my granddaughters favorite blankee. It was a wonderful purchase."
5,Perfect for a Train Enthusiast,"I bought this book (the hardcover version) for my 4-year-old grandson who is infatuated by trains. He's been reading since age three and he loves the illustrations as well as the stories as told by a young boy. The illustrations are charming and realistic, the history is fascinating. A great book for young people, pre-school to grade three."
3,It's Okay,"We bought this book after enjoying other books by this author. I was pretty disappointed. It takes you through a family of train people and insists on talking about my great-great-great-great grandpa. If he had used the phrase great-great-great-grandpa Joe once, then just called him Joe it would have been okay, but with each successive generation back he kept referring to great-great-great grandpa more than once. My seven year old got a little sick of saying all of those ""greats"" and I got pretty sick of hearing them."
4,Perfect for Clinicians,"Dr. Cermak presents the subject of Co-Dependence in an intriguing manner. From his introduction with a recap of the Narcissus and Echo tale to his treatment regimen, and especially including his diagnostic criteria, his work is well thought out and presented. I highly recommend this book for anyone who works with chemically dependent clients or their families."
5,Buff Puff Believer,"I love my buff puffs! Every since I started using them to exfoliate I stopped getting the notorious zits around that time of, well, you know that woman thing! I am very, very pleased...thank you!!"
5,Works for me,"I can't find this product anywhere in the stores anymore which is very sad, but at least it's available on line! They last forever and work really well to exfoliate. Gentle is best, but the regular is a bit too harsh."
3,The Big Fisherman,"This book started out interesting. It's the story of Fara, or Esther, and how she doesn't fit in anywhere. Her mother's people, whom she is raised with, don't like her because she is half Jewish. She hasn't been with her father, Herod, since she was a baby.It then starts to go into the story of Simon Peter, or The Big Fisherman. The author has the two meet and they don't like each other at all. Then, they both start following Jesus, and become dear friends. The story sort-of lagged in the middle/end. It also is not Bibically accurate, which bothered me. Still, it helped me see more of what it might have been like to be Peter. Taking this all together, I'd say it's an OK book. (one small note: I bought this book because I thought it was the second part to Dougless' more famous book ""The Robe"". It's not. Although there are slight mentions of some of the charaters in ""The Robe"", the two books don't really have anything to do with each other.)"
4,a new outlook,this was excellent religion fiction. it really puts you in that day and time and gives anyone a new outlook on what Jesus did for us!
1,the big fisherman,I would really like to write a review but cannot because I have not received this book to date 5-11-2009. It was ordered and paid for on 4-8-2009. If anything I am very disappointed and feel I have been taken advantage of and lost my money and I will not order from amazon again.
5,The Big Fisherman,"This is a great book. It has it all- romance, history, religion, intrigue, human drama and suspense. Lloyd C. Douglas has written many good books, but ""The Robe"" and this one reign supreme. Don't miss it!"
2,"Not as well written as ""The Robe""","Having read and enjoyed ""The Robe"" I purchased a used copy of ""The Big Fisherman"". Not worth it. This book was obviously not crafted with the same care as the other book. I found the writing to be shoddy. Much of the action takes place ""off stage"", to be described in third person terms as an event already past. I found most of the speculative or fictional part of the story to not ring true -- only when he speaks in the words of the Gospel does Douglas manage to resonate."
1,Hopelessly boring,"I first read The Robe (multiple times) beginning when I was about 7 or 8, saw the movie when it came out. Then I saw that The Robe was on Kindle, got it to see if it was still worth reading after 50 years or so, and I enjoyed it. (Douglas does tend to overwork the verb ""drawled"" for ""said"").I'd never seen the movie ""Demetrius & the Gladiators"" or read Douglas' ""Big Fisherman"", so I tried both. ""Gladiators"" was rather fun, a good old Hollywood costume flick (sword fights, dancing girls), but the book ""Big Fisherman"" is a hopeless bore, full of anachronistic nonsense.I slogged through several chapters of this Arabian Princess & Palestinian Greek Prince romance (with no hint of a biblical/Christian connection yet) that wouldn't have entertained me when I was age 8, and gave up. I deleted it from my Kindle and if it had been a paper copy I would have recycled it."
2,"Good Fiction Read, Not Accurate Biblically","Others have outlined the story in their reviews accurately. Only one so far has pointed out that it is biblically inaccurate. It is an interesting story, although I thought the ending was disappointing (as far as the story of Fara goes). If you hope to gain insights into Christianity by reading this book, go to the Bible instead. This book explains away many of Christ's miracles, and the account of the Loaves and Fishes is sincerely warped. I'm not sure how religiously trained Mr. Douglas was, but he didn't seem to have much biblical knowledge. If he did, then he was trying outright to cast doubts upon the faith of those who read his book. His interpretation of Christ's teachings was sometimes very flawed, although at times he quoted him accurately, and there were powerful teachings."
4,The Big Fisherman by Lloyd Douglas,I am pleased with my purchase. The book arrived soon and in good but old condition as expected. I lost my original copy and was glad to find this one listed.
3,Wonderful But hard to Find,"When these were clearanced at my local store I stocked up. I use the on myDove SkinVitalizer Facial Cleansing Massager with 1 Massager and 6 Exfoliating Pillowsin place of the pillows which are hard to find. These are part of my daily night time routine. I take care of my face and neck with 1/2 of the disc and my decolletage/boobies and back of my hands with the other. Actually, with the Skinvitalizer I get more use out of the discs than I DID the usual way and pamper myself more :)"
2,not good and not very bad,The choclate come very quickly. But there only 4 differnet kinds of chocklate in it and also only a little box..the chcolate taste like it standed before a long long time in the closet.. Not very nice when I would give it to other peolpel and they think I give them old choclate..:(
1,Tired and Dated,"They can say its a new edition or its been updated, but the fact is that this particular outsourcing book is best borrowed.We researched many books on the subject and this one has been around for awhile. Its basically one chapter reproduced several times for different departments but the insight is far from ground breaking. I advise you look at the current leaders in outsourcing book sales and get some newer information and innovative ideas.On a positive note, if you have never had any exposure to outsourcing before, this book may meet your needs."
3,The Good and the Bad,"This should have been Joni James' greatest peformances, not greatest hits. I was pleasantly surprised when this was released. The 1st 12 tracks, [which made up Joni's AWARD WINNING ALBUM] are beyond desription. They are actually an oxymoron: intelligent, sophisticated pop hits. Joni was lucky to have the songwriters & arrangers she did to work on those forgotten treaures; but as time went on, her voice & song quality faltered. I wish just the excellant & the good were put on the cd. Actually I Need You Now should have been included. Ditto for Anyone But Her, an exception to her late releases. It's very listenable. Dinah Washington once said of Joni James. ""I sound better when I have a cold"" That maybe very true but when Joni had the right material & back up in her early years, she was almost Eydie Gorme or Judy Garland. She was THAT GREAT!"
4,Very fine Dusty,"Dusty's last album is well worth looking out for, if you haven't already. It features some really nice songs. Dusty recorded the album in Nashville. Some of the songs are a little weaker, and the production isn't always great, but the cd is still pretty good. Her voice is very warm and strong as usual. ""Roll Away"" is an excellent album opener. ""You are The Storm"" and ""Go Easy On Me"" are great ballads. ""Wherever Would I Be"" is a great duet with Daryl Hall, although I like the solo version better (found on her HEART AND SOUL compilation of rarities and live tracks). The album closer ""Where Is A Woman To Go"" is a great bluesy track and a good way to close off the album. A few tracks I don't care for much are ""Old Habits Die Hard"", the Diane Warren song ""Lovin Proof"". Otherwise it's a fairly good album of songs from Dusty, which would be her last album of new material."
5,a very fine album of covers,this is such a timeless classic. the ablum is by and large a covers album 3 tracks were new here is what was new and what were covers1 roll away new song2 very fine love originally by pam tillis3 wherever would i be originally by cheap trick4 go easy on me new song5 you are the storm originally by matraca berg6 i cant help the way that i dont feel originally by waylon jennings7 all i have to offer you is love new song later covered by tanya tucker8 lovin proof originally by celine dion9 old habits die hard originally by crystal gayle10 where is a woman to go originally by kt oslinone of my favourite dusty albums buy this gem and dont be disappointed
1,Not What It Sems,"This item, which I mistakenly purchased, is not what it says. It is a computerized instrumental version of some of the themes used by early congalese rumba composers. IT IS NOT the original music composed and played by these bands!!"
1,Ridiculous,Another work of paranoia making the work of God look evil through lies and false witness. This kind of erroneous and deceptive material is why Pagans are the hardest group in America to witness to.
3,Are you a satanist?,According to this book anyone who celebrates their birthdays could very well be a satanist. Oh and also anyone who doesnt clean their room.:-) YeahhhSatan!
4,"A bit off-color, but solid and entertaining","Welcome to the land of Arir! In this rare adventure, your PCs (levels 8-10) will find themselves seeking the Talisman of Al'Akbar - a wondrous artifact capable of saving their realm from the plague that besets it. Along the way, they'll discover blue dragons, mummies, and in the Sultan's palace, Dispater himself! (Heheh...) A grand adventure in true ""pulp"" style, time for a little tomb raiding..."
3,Better to get it from the Roosterteeth.com,"I purchased this from Amazon because I have prime with free shipping. This was a mistake. In this version of the Blu-ray, you get the movie, outtakes and commentary. If you get it from the store at Roosterteeth.com, you get a second disk packed with special features. Don't get me wrong, this season is fantastic, but if you are like me and like to watch the behind the scenes and other special features, get it from Roosterteeth.com You might have to spend a little more, but it is worth it, and all the proceeds go to supporting Roosterteeth."
5,Great!,"Rooster Teeth (The group that created this series, look it up, its great) always creates fantastic movies and comedy series and this is just another in their long line of that quality."
5,Love it,Love it its so funny And got here quick wonderful gift the whole family can enjoy even my husband like it!
5,Best Yet,Love the series. A lot of action to keep you glued to the show. The storyline is very good. Best yet.
5,Enjoy it and buy it.,"To describe JI's sound and technically perfect music no words are allowed or needed, this is a must for all you Mozar-piano-player-lovers, and also, for all those that love good music and a player with a heart.Some of the pieces will just make you shiver out of enjoyment."
5,Great Introduction,"I had never read Feluda before, and this book made me a great fan of Bengali literature itself. It has been translated very well, and you can find the genius of Satyajit Ray in the book. A beautiful read!"
4,2 year old loves it!,"I had to do a review when I only saw one that wasn't so great. This has been my daughter's favorite cd for at least 6 months. She always wants to listen. There are 4 songs that she wants to hear over and over. The rest are good, but not as catchy. She is always singing her favorite songs from the cd to us. I say it's worth it just for those songs. Especially because I like them too and don't mind listening to them over and over."
3,Okay,"This CD is ""okay"" but my kids do not like it nearly as much as the ""Most Amazing Dinosaur Songs"""
2,Adequate but not great,"The basic life story of Valentino is told, but it is the telling that is off-putting. A curious style of unscholarly writing together with the misuse of terms (e.g., ""hoi polloi"" is used to refer to the ""elite"" when in fact it means the ""common"") detracts from the narrative. And, as to one of the persisting questions regarding Valentino's sexual orientation, her descriptions of his relationships is at odds with her conclusions. Not the definitive text this subject needs."
5,Special Book,"This is a well researched and beautifully written biography. Emily Leider has lovingly painted a portrait of a man/star whose life has been clouded in mystery. Because of her, Rudolph Valentino's complex personality, warmth, generosity, talent, and sense of humor has become known for the first time. Beautiful photographs, including his last formal portrait before his untimely death, are included. I prefer this biography to others of Valentino I have read."
1,"Not New, caliper was rebuilt but sold as a NEW item","The description lists this as being NEW, not rebuilt. The item that was sent to me was REMANUFACTURED, and not NEW.Me copy of the order clearly lists the item as NEW. Pretty disappointing from Amazon Prime."
2,Very little depth to this article,"For $6 I was expecting a much longer article, but now I have some idea of how to translate the word count. This is a very basic article with very little information that can't be had by perusing any Grand Banks forum. If you are looking for info on what to watch out for when buying a used GB 42, pros and cons of various engines offered, construction details, etc. you will be dissappointed as these points are only lightly touched upon. If you are trying to get a feel for the GB 42 as compared to other brands of trawlers, or trawlers vs. express cruisers and other types of boats, then this might satisfy your apetite."
1,Don't Be Fooled.,"This isn't really Dokken. Not the ""real"" Dokken. Without Pilsen and Lynch this is just ""Don Dokken"". As far as I'm concerned ""Back for the Attack"" was the last real Dokken album and it hasn't been the same or as good since. Why can't Don get all the players back? Well, if you do some research online you'll find that there is a lot of bad blood between them. What a shame. I saw Lynch play a show last year (2001) and he still rocked the house and even played a good medley of old Dokken tunes! It was AWESOME! I look forward to his forthcoming studio effort with Pilsen."
1,"Really bad, don't waste your money","Next to Shadow Life, this is the second worst CD Dokken has put out. I don't understand why they choose to write this stuff when their fan base is from the 80's. I've waited for their writing skills to warm up, but I can't wait any longer, this is the last Dokken CD I buy.For starters, it has no energy. The guitar sounds like a gas powered chain saw. It doesn't evoke a mood or feeling. The production is terrible, I can't even say that any of it sounds good.This doesn't even come close to Tooth and Nail or Under Lock and Key. It's sad to see a great band fall apart and go down in flames."
3,What happened here?,"I was hoping this cd would be alot more rocking than it actually is. I was very bothered with the fact that it is a little too mellow. The opening track is a hit on internet channel ""KNAC.COM"" but the rest of the album is just a little too weak. I thought that bringing John Norum aboard would create that spark, I guess it created a spark, a spark of balladesque feel. I am a huge fan of DOKKEN, that is why I purchased this album. The only reason I would recommend the purchase to anyone else is because that there is a few good songs but to keep the rock alive. Maybe the boys in DOKKEN will see that there is a need to get to their roots and bring back the rock."
1,Pass on this one,"It's no wonder that you can buy this CD used already, it just came out! This is the last of dokken CD that I'll be buying.They are still playing 60's style rock with poor quality song writing, and when the whole band starts singing together, it sounds like the muppets induced on alcohol. The production quality is terrible, mixing is ok, the overall sound is terrible, gives me a headache. What happened to the full sounding guitars? Did someone forget their effects rack? I use to be a major fan, but with all the disapointments since their re-union, this is the last one. I might just sell my copy and I just got it. Don't waste you money, pass on this one.I think Don should just give it up completely, now with more line-up changes. Norum is out/replaced, Mick is out now. This isn't the old Dokken that we grew up with and loved in the 80's."
2,"Come on Don, Kick it up","Basically I liked this music, but it just didn't move me. It makes me want to kick back and relax..."
4,Not 80's Dokken - but still rockin'...,"I think I'm in the majority in saying that this album took some time to grow on me, but this is a very solid release. Let's get one thing out of the way - John Norum isn't George Lynch, nobody is. Norum realy isn't going to drop your jaw to the floor but he handles the guitars very well. If you are a fan of Dokken, this album has solid songs throughout - with some definite gems and Don's typical strong vocals.Some of the highlights include: Sunless Days(classic Dokken), Everybody Needs(has kind of a trippy 60's/70's vibe to it), Goodbye My Friend(a good simple piano based ballad), Magic Road(straight ahead driving rocker) and Heart Full Of Soul(cover of the Yardbirds classic).If your looking for 80's style Dokken this isn't it, but the songs are still solid and Don Dokken's vocals are some of the best to come from that era. If you are new to Dokken start with their earlier albums, but this is also worth a listen."
3,This is a good cd/album.......,"but it is not the Dokken that I remember listening to. It is slow rock but yet still good to listen to. Let us just say that this is a mature rock sound from a very decent 80's band. The more I listen to it, the better I like it. Its cool, just slow."
5,dokken continues to Rock,"This is a great CD, Guitar wise John Norum doesn't rip it up as Reb Beach did on Dokkens previous ""Erase the Slate"", but He does a great job of carrying on that Dokken sound. I have no doubt John will hold his own once Dokken starts touring, I have some other CDs with his work on them and he is incredible. This CD shows kind of a different side of Dokken, a few songs sound kind of beatles like if I may use that label. Bottom line this is another excellent effort from Dokken, Don is carrying on the Word, This version of Dokken only has two original members but the sound is still very much Dokken and very Metal. I recommend this CD to any hard rock or Dokken fan."
1,Save your money!...,"First, let me start by saying I have all of Dokkens' cds and Don's solo stuff. I love Dokken, they are one of my favorite bands. Let's cut through all the B.S., to say this CD stinks is being too nice. John Norum is boring,unimaginative and couldn't fill George Lynch's shoes if he could play 2 guitars at once. This isn't a Dokken CD, it's a solo Don Dokken CD. Dokken used to make you want to bang your head, this CD makes you want to throw yourself off a bridge. I gave the CD to another big Dokken friend of mine and he gave it to another and another, ect. You get the picture. I imagine at some point and time it will end up ... where it belongs. Lastly, some of you ... that review music use the term 80's hair bands as if it were a bad word. The 80's hair bands put out some of the best tunes in Rock History. It beats the junk that's been out the last 20 years."
1,Terrible...,Anyone with such bad taste as to give this album 4 stars needs to have their ears checked.
2,Thank god for music downloads!,"I have to say this CD is a little better than Shadow Life, but not much better. I have been a Dokken fan from early 80's and I still jam to them to this day. I wish the love songs were not there, the rest of the songs are good. DOWNLOAD AND BURN don't BUY!"
4,More Don.......MORE!,"Huge long time Dokken fan; all of it. Each album has its own flavor; some rockin' with anthems and pyrotechnics, some more somber and emotional. Don has one of the sweetest metal voices ever, I just LOVE his wail. I have seem him twice, once with Reb Beach, and once with John Norum, and both times Don was the show! This album is a great collection of straight ahead rockers that tell a story, and dare I say smooth, soulful ballads. No, this is not a George Lynch style of music, but I am not certain Don's voice really fits that shredding type of mentality and music. And a clue to those who have not heard George live, he is much better as a studio musician. Let Pilson/Lynch have their thing...Don is just fine without them! This album grows on you...the first listen I was disappointed; but by the 5th or 6th I was HOOKED!"
2,"Hello Dolly great, Channing root of all evil","While Hello, Dolly is a fabulous musical, I wouldn't recommend this recording on my life, which is unfortunate because of the other talented actors and actresses on it. Carol Channing's voice makes one shudder... She can't sing worth her life: she's breathy, and she has a smoker's voice. Although some believe Barbara Streisand was a terrible choice for Dolly in the 1969 movie (i believe this is the year), I would *strongly* recommend her over Channing- she can at least support her sound and stay on pitch. I honestly can't see how *anyone* can stand to listen to Channing for more than five minutes.~little_daae@phantom.zzn.com"
1,wrong picture/description,"Title and description was for Ellie shoes, drop down menu gave choice of sizes, received some kind of car part."
1,Lousy after two weeks,Beautiful and comfortable for only two weeks. Insides near toes have peeled back and make the slippers very uncomfortable. Odor is terrible (I only put them on after showering/feet were dry). Not worth the money. Huge disappointment. Threw away after less than one month of use.
1,Not worth the headaches...,This computer overheats constantly. Nothing helps - read various computer forums online and you'll see Toshiba has a huge problem on its hands with this. There is also have a class action settlement currently underway on a similar Toshiba model for the same issue.
4,I Am AFRAID.,"Sure, you all remember KTel Records from the 70s? Crappy recordings, lame songs. Guess what? They got better. This is a surprisingly good album from the label that I will always associate with evil bad recordings of crappy disco songs. But these songs are GREAT! I HIGHLY recomend this album."
5,Lumley has mastered the human psyche!,Brian Lumley masterfully spins a web ofspellbinding terror and mystical places inwhich Harry Keogh finds himself in the middle.Keoegh gets caught up in a whirlwind of horrorwhile trying to search for his wife and son. Abrilliant masterpiece!
5,Great seller. VERY Fast shipping. Book in PERFECT condition.,Definitely recommend! The book was in BETTER condition than described. FAST shipping!!! Great seller! Will return when I need more books. A++
5,Barker,A staggering collection of Clive Barker's short fiction. I've read this book at least once a year for over 15 years now. it's that good.
4,A Ghostly Story,"This ghost story starts out so slowly, I almost thought it wasn't going to go anywhere. But that was part of it's charm. It's so peaceful, with the elderly protagonist looking back on one terrible, terrifying week of his life and telling his story for his family, and for himself, to finally lay the past to rest. It is simply one of the most readable, simple, yet disturbing stories of fear and malevolence. A fright that lasts a man's lifetime, continues to haunt him throughout his life, and on many levels. The prose is wonderful in its simplicity and the climax is bone-chilling.A friend read this and it sounded interesting so I decided to check it out. I'm so glad I did. This is a classic hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck-stand-up ghost story. Great stuff!"
4,Entrapped,"Woman in Black is a short, concise story of a young man who unwittingly steps into a tragedy that will change the course of his entire life. Sent to a small remote village as a solicitor, to settle an elderly and mysterious recluse's estate, Arthur Kipp almost immediately can sense that something dangerous and terrifying is at work, but none of the townspeople is willing to clue him in. Why? Who is this unbearably sad yet vengeful spectre? What does she want of Arthur, who is simply a well-meaning lawyer sent to do a routine job? These questions, and more, are not answered until the very last page of this intensely atmospheric tale."
3,Not my favorite,"I very much looked forward to reading this story after having read ""AKind Man"" which I enjoyed greatly. I braced myself for a really scary ghost story but was disappointed. It is an OK short novel but unfortunately it didn't give me a real chill as I expected."
2,Not so scary!,"I purchased this book because it is supposed to be a very scary ghost story and I love ghost stories, but I was sadly disappointed. While there is, indeed, a ghost in the book, she is mean and evil rather than terrifying. When the narrator first encounters supernatural happenings in the bog it is not a heart-thumping moment as I would have liked. All in all, it was a disappointment."
2,where's the scary part?,this is probably a case where reading the reviews caused me to have unreasonable expectations. I thought this book would be really imaginative and scary. it was a good read but then i came to the end and was still waiting for something exciting to happen. I seriously think i could have read it by candlelight sitting in my house alone during a thunder storm and never looked over my shoulder once.
2,This is a short-novel,"Had I known that this was a short novel, I certainly wouldn't have bothered buying it. Way to ride the hype of the movie... if you are into short novels, then I am sure it is a great one."
4,well writern,i loved this book after seeing the origanial movie years ago and having been disapointed with the remake i wanted to read the book to see which movie stayed true to it although i hate watching the movie before reading the book it was still a good read and scary and now i only hope i can find a copy of the origanial movie again
4,The Woman in Black,"The book as object is lovely and the story is Gothic-ly entertaining. The ending felt abrupt, but all in all it is a good read."
3,Not As Good As the Movie.,"If you venture into this book, read it first before you see the movie. Sort of slow going where the movie was engaging pretty much from the start."
3,Predictable,I purchased this book as I had seen reviews about the movie but wanted to read the book first. As mentioned I didn't really know much about it apart from the movie information and thought it would be dark and unsettling but it wasn't. This book although easy to read was very predictable and not at all frightening. Maybe the movie will be better.
3,Could have been better,"Not completely horrible but the end was predicable. Some passages seemed long and unnecessary, you can skip a paragraph here and there and still not lose any of the story. Decent imagery though."
5,The use of language alone makes this a must read,"As my caption says, the usage of language in this book alone makes this a must read. I loved this book. I loved this book and would recommend it to all. To those who might not like ghost stories, you need to read it for the sheer pleasure of experiencing language used to the best advantage. This was a gift for my birthday and what a great gift it turned out to be."
4,Creepy fun,"I really did enjoy this book. I got it only because of the movie and thought it would be a good one to read before seeing it on the screen. It was quick, smart, and a little scary. I don't do horror, not because I don't enjoy it, I just have too much other stuff on my to read list. Oh, and I get really, really freaked out when reading even the slightest scary bit in a book. I loved the writing, enjoyed the vocabulary (had to use a dictionary a few times which I love), and liked the storyline. The scary parts were interspersed throughout the descriptive details of the protagonists surroundings and life. Overall, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would! It was a quick, fun, eerie escape from my usual type of reads."
3,almost great,"I like ghost stories that are more psychological than violent. This one fits the bill, almost. The 1st 3/4s of the book are exactly what I wanted - atmospheric, chilling, some parts actually made me put the book down for a while until my nerves settled. So why 3 stars? Thanks for asking. The ending was an enormous let down. It was telegraphed (I saw it coming before the protganist even begins recounting his story), and although tragic, it is completely missing the terror and dread of the rest of the book. To make matters worse, the logical flow of the ending actually undercuts the rest of the story. Very frustrating. If Ms. Hill had just known when to stop this would have gone on my list of great ghost stories. 4 stars for the 1st 3/4s of the book, 1 star for the ending."
3,OK story - NOT scary - NOTHING like the movie,"I tried to read this book several years ago and found it slow going. But I enjoyed the movie so much that I decided to give it another try. She's a competent writer, but honestly nothing really ever happens in the story. If you're expecting the shocks and terrors of the excellent movie, prepare for disappointment. Except for a couple of characters shared in common, almost everything that happens in the film has been created for the film. The fire with the little girl and the Woman in Black? Nope. The child rising out of the marsh? No. The woman screaming in the window? Sorry.If you like atmosphere, you'll be fine with this book. If you want scary, read M.R. James."
4,Good old fashioned ghost story.,"If you're looking for a book that matches the trailer for the recent movie - don't buy this book. But if you love an atmospheric ghost story you will enjoy this book. I would consider this haunting tale a psychological thriller; one in which the reader is not sure if the protagonist is paranoid, naive or simply imaginative. The suspense is created by hinting and forshadowing. A very enjoyable, quick read - great for an overcast day or stormy evening."
5,A Haunting Tale,"One of the most captivating hauntingly dramatic books. So well told in such a short novel, the author didn't leave in unnecessary wordiness. I ended up lending this book to a friend and they loved it so much I had to buy another book for myself. The Woman in Black is really a moving read!"
5,The very best ghost story --- ever,"I'm happy this book is now available again to Amazon readers. It is quite simply, the most readable, simple, yet disturbing story of dread and malevolence. A fright that lasts a man's lifetime, and blights his life in many ways, and on many levels. The prose is wonderful in its simplicity, and I recommend reading it aloud to share."
4,A gripping suspenceful ghost story,"Tragically sad and painfully horrifying, this book is hauntingly surreal, well plotted and written in an accessible and readable style."
2,Nothing Scary about it,"I keep searching for a scary book, but it just isn't happening for me. Same problem with movies. This book was so boring to me the first 105 pages, it felt like all filler. The book only has 138 pages so that should warn you. I hate that I wasted my money on it. The library didn't have any copies, that should have told me something also. I can only say I wish I could be so easily scared by a book as the readers that gave it 4 & 5 stars. If anyone can tell me a really scary book, please let me know. Thanks"
1,Disappointing,"I must not have read the same book the others did. For me this book was very average. I don't usually do well at guessing what is going to happen, but I was way ahead of this book all the way through. The writing style is appropriately atmospheric, but I certainly wouldn't put this is a league with Shirley Jackson. I'm hoping the live theatrical version of the book will be a much better experience."
1,Wasn't there an editor for this book?! Awful!,"I could not get through a chapter of this book. Try reading it aloud- you will be gasping for breath from the run-on sentences.How did this book get so many favorable reviews? It is a pale and inadequate attempt to the 19th century British Gothic tale.Do yourself a favor,and pass this one by. I have never been so lead in to such a disapointment as I was with thisbook."
2,Reading = Boredom; Visually = Interesting.,"""The Woman in Black: A Ghost Play"" is an adaptation of the novel by Susan Hill and I do not think it transcends to a script well. I saw a production of this play and visually, it's fantastic; reading it will cause confusion and boredom. The stage directions and lack of information will turn people away from this play. I do not recommend."
4,Atmospheric,"A traditional style ghost story which is set around the turn of the 19th/20th century.Like all the best ghost stories it wasn't overly long, and successfully built up the ambience of Eel Marsh House secluded by fog and marshland. The main character, Arthur Kipps a young London solicitor, is easy to relate to with his determination to complete his job balanced with his unease and fear of the malevolence surrounding Eel Marsh and the Woman in Black. Hill pays attention to detail without becoming tedious in order to create an atmospheric and chilling tale.Although I saw the West End theatre version of the story a few years ago it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the book but I did find the stage version just had the edge when it came to the fear factor."
1,terrible,"unless you're the size of King Kong, these gloves are all way too big for any woman's hands."
2,"Bulky, not real useful...","Good idea, but not really practical.. better off using regular rubber gloves and a sponge, especially for scrubbing.."
2,Where is the color?,"I ordered this on Amazon, just received it, and was very excited until I opened the book and saw that all the pages were in a very low quality black and white print(more like a grey and white). My guess is that they didn't want people scanning or photocopying the pages. Maybe they thought this would cut down on people copying the pages, but what a let down! It is also incomplete! I do have some original Sears Christmas Catalogs that I ordered on Ebay and that is a much better way to go. Would have gotten five stars if it had color pages and was more complete! I DO NOT recommend this book. Buy the Totally Tubular 80's Toys book instead!"
2,Wish it was in color!!!!,"I agree with the comments above. Book is decent and somewhat informative but everything being in black and white was a big letdown. Also, they tend to focus just on Star Wars. Maybe the author was a fan? It's an ""ok"" book, it may be worth seeking out old Sears catalogs on Ebay though."
3,NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just saw this book and was freaking out thinking i had found the ultimate time machine to my childhood, then i read the reviews to see the pictures are in black and white and not color as they appeared in the catalog!Why would any company take the time to do such a cool book and print in black and white?Hopefully there is a master copy of the book out there somewhere and another company will purchase the rights and print it in color!"
3,"GREAT SONGS, INCOMPLETE ALBUM","Advice to new fans: It will be much more rewarding to but Springsteen's original studio albums. I am a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, and there really isn't a bad cut on this album...but any Springsteen fan cannot deny that there are many, many ""hits"" missing. The new material recorded for the album is great stuff, but if this is supposed to be a greatest hits album, it should have included the obvious hits ""Cover Me"", ""I'm On Fire"", ""I'm Going Down"", ""Tunnel Of Love"", ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out""...the songs we hear on the radio...and maybe even an earlier cut like ""Growing Up"", just for some pre-Born To Run material. Again, a fun listen, but it's a bit dissapointing considering this is likely to be the only Boss cd that a lot of people from my generation will ever own (I'm 23)."
3,CD is great but not complete,"This CD from Bruce Springsteen is really fun to listen to. It contains some of his greatest hits such as ""Dancing In The Dark"", ""Born In The U.S.A"" and ""Glory Days"" and even ""Secret Garden"" along with some other neat tracks, but unfortunately, I would not call this a greatest hits album...why?...because it is not complete. There are many more greatest hits by Bruce Springsteen that are not on the album. For instance, ""Fade Away"", ""Cover Me"", ""I'm On Fire"", ""I'm Goin Down"", and ""Tunnel Of Love"", were all top hits from Bruce Springsteen according to Billboard. Why these tracks are not on here...I don't know but they should be because most of these songs were some of his most popular ones and they aren't even on here. I do like the CD but it would be much better if there were some other hits on here."
3,It's really Bruce Springsteen-The Singles,"The first two albums are ignored and the rest of the songs are available in a number of other places. So why get this one? The last four cuts are the reunited E-Street band after Bruce's brief and not entirely successful attempt at going on without them. The cuts are a mixed bag with the hard driving, ""Murder Inc."" and his ode to the band, ""Blood Brothers,"" sandwiched between the gentle ""Secret Garden"" and the out of sorts mix of country lyrics and rock beat of ""This Hard Land."" Is it worth the price? Fans (like me) will have to have it, but the casual listener should search for the CD that has the songs they like on this one. That will definitely be a more satisfying listen."
1,"Where's ""Jesse's Girl""?","I can't believe they have the nerve to call this Bruce Springsteen's greatest hits. It doesn't even have ""Jesse's Girl,"" Springsteen's biggest hit ever, much less other great Springsteen songs like ""I've Done Everything For You."" Greatest hits? A bunch of junk is more like it!"
1,"He's not even an American, people!","Greatest hits? How about renaming the title to Bruce Springsteen: Songs Nobody Listens to Anymore. Ever since Bruce changed his name from John Cougar Mellencamp his career has gone down hill fast.Also, what's with the guitar on the album cover? Sure, he's decent at playing piano, but trying to make him into some rocker who plays guitar is a bit of a stretch.While Born In the U.S.A. is a great song, and it's been widely used in political campaigns, the song is ludicrous considering this man is a Canadian citizen. His single claim to fame is a song about being born somewhere that he wasn't.Don't buy new, buy one of the 300,000 used copies for .99 cents if you must."
2,Born To Run Out Of Gas...and new methods of environmental conservation,"I remember this LP in the 70's as one of the most important rock albums since Bob Dylan (not my personal favorite). I do like Bruce and still can't figure out why he would not let fellow Jew Bette Midler record Pink Cadillac, claiming at the time that it was not a song meant to be sung by a woman. He ""changed his tune"" a few years later by allowing Natalie Cole to do a disco version of the song and score a top 10 hit with it.It just seems to put in perspective, a new meaning to the original thought. Is life fair?...No. Are the Democrats and Republicans the same? Yes! It's all about contradiction~It's hard to listen to this CD with the free spirit I once had in my youth. When now I hear how I am mislead to follow the leader. So hard to shake the ashes of the past from my feet!"
1,POINTLESS,I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY PEOPLE LIKE HIM OR HIS MUSIC.EVEN HIS NEWEST SONGS SOUND OLD.HE SHOULD STOP WRITING SONGS.IT WOULD BE GREAT IF HE WOULD DO COVERS OF OTHER BAND'S SONGS.HE SHOULD SING ABBA SONGS.DANCING QUEEN WOULD BE GREAT.
1,Springsteen blows.,"A master of tricking people to think his music is cool. He may just be as great a self promoter as Obama. His band is decent, but I can't get past his complete lack talent. Can he play a guitar? 3 chords badly. Can he sing? Yea....one frigging note. Monotone is his middle name. Clapton has talent. Brucie and Britney.....proof that talent is not mandatory for comercial success in the USA."
3,Not justice,No greatest hits complition will ever do justice to all that Bruce Springsteen has done for rock n roll. Go out and buy the real albums. Start with Born to Run. Work your way through from there.
1,What is the purpose of this CD?,"I always thought of Bruce Springsteen as someone who made albums, and some very good ones at that. His 1975 album BORN TO RUN is one of my 10 favorite albums of all time. Why anybody would want to buy a geatest hits compilation of Bruce Springsteen songs is beyond me. I hate this CD simply because I love Bruce's original albums so much. And if you're only going to have one Bruce Springsteen CD in your collection, then I suggest that you get BORN TO RUN."
2,My Back Would Be Turned Away Also.,"Even Springsteen did not like the song selection for the greatest hits cd, that's why his back is turned away to show his shame at Columbia. 8 good songs I see (1-5,7,8,&10) but how could they leave off fan favorites like ""Rosalita"", ""Cadillac Ranch"", and ""10th Ave. Freeze Out"". or other good songs ""Prove It All Night"", ""Promise Land"", ""Jungle Land"", ""Pink Cadillac"", ""She's the One"", ""Out in the Street"", ""You Can Look (but you better not touch)"" and ""Cover Me"". To cover all these would probably need 2 disc set, but why not, ""The Boss"" deserves it, but leave off the solo stuff he's better with the E Steet Band."
3,Greatest Hits?,"This album includes some (not all) of Bruce Springsteen's greatest hits, i.e. his most popular songs as played on the radio. This is not an album of Bruce Springsteen's best songs. The two should not be confused. Where is Because The Night, Kitty's Back, Blinded By The Light, Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, Rosalita, The E Street Shuffle, or Spirit In The Night? This is a solid album of ""hits"" but falls short of capturing the essence of Bruce. Yes, the songs chronicle his shifting moods and failed relationships from Born To Run to the contemporary fluff pieces (nothing close to ""hits"") from a reunionized E Street Band. For those who appreciated and loved Bruce before he became famous and had hits, this album will deliver but, ultimately, disappoint."
5,My husband loved his Springsteen CD,Product arrived in no time at all. Perfect listening. It was a gift for my husband and he loved every listening minute of the CD. A great seller to deal with!
3,Greatest Hits In Need of Sound Improvements,"Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits has most of the songs you would expect, but several flaws were noticed.The sound quality of the first few cuts, including ""Born to Run"" and ""Thunder Road"" did not jump off the CD like I had hoped. Bruce's early anthems have received no improved production and are a simple rehash of the original studio cuts. I remember getting an electric rush off the LPs I bought back in the 70's. The sound quality seems muted compared to many recent Greatest Hits albums and reissues by other artists.Secondly, I would have eliminated the new cuts off the greatest hits album. They are decent songs, but act as a little false advertising. I know it is a common approach among the record studios when issueing GH albums, but spending the money on going back to the master tracks would have been worth more than the not hit cuts included"
1,no way,"Bruce hits album aint all its up to be. There were many MANY great boss songs that should have made this at least a double disc album. The songs are great on here, dont get me wrong, but i think the record company did a poor job. sorry guys!"
2,This One Disappointed Me!!!,"I have been a fan of Bruce Springsteen long before he became a household name throughout the U.S.A. I primarily like his earlier works, but have listened to a lot of what he has done over the years. Missing from this Greatest Hits collection is Tunnel Of Love and One Step Up. I am sure that their are others but, those two stand out. This may appeal to someone who is just trying to add some of his music to their collection. Perhaps, someone who isn't that familiar with him may enjoy this, but this one disappointed me!"
4,The Boss,I was looking for something like this so I didn't have to buy all the cd's to get the hits. This is a good mix of most of his popular and favorite hits throughout his career.
5,My favorite Springsteen,I am buying this CD to replace my well worn tape and old scratched cd. Hopefully my kids will take better care of this one than my previous copy. This is my favorite Springsteen album - but I have not heard all of Magic.
4,Excellent CD - Captured me as a new Bruce Springsteen fan,"This is one of my favorite CDs. It is my first Springsteen CD and I have fallen in love with his music. Just about every song is excellent, putting me in good spirit and providing great long-distance driving music. I highly recommend it. The star it didn't receive is solely for the 2 songs (of 18) that didn't grab me."
3,The Legend,"I'd never known much about Springsteen so I decided to buy one of his CD's because of all the hype about him doing the Super Bowl. I got a recommendation from my BIL (who has seen Bruce in concert a zillion times) to start with this CD. It was ok, but I would not buy anything else Bruce did. I guess he's just not for me.I couldn't understand all the lyrics and the music seemed somewhat trite at times. He does display enormous energy."
3,Wasted opportunity,"What a waste - probably the shallowest and poorest summary of a wonderful rock career. This should have been a two disc set AT LEAST.All the songs are of course excellent but I feel cheated that this is pretending to be the ""best of/greatest hits of......"" Bruce.Nothing from his first two albums - no Rosalita, Blinded by the Light, Spirit in the Night, Incident on 57th Street, etc., etc. But even worse is the omission of some true classics - mostly ""album tracks"" like Point Blank, Stolen Car, Reason to Believe, Johnny 99, Jungleland - the list goes on.The new tracks, particularly This Hard Land (much desired since his '93 tour) are excellent and greately appreciated but it is now difficult, in the light of Tracks and 18 Tracks, to see their inclusion on this release as little more than a cynical marketing ploy.Sadly, the Bruce album I play the least.Worth buying for those new to Bruce, but will disappoint others."
4,Just a note,"On the one-star review above, the author claims that the song ""Walking in Memphis"" was an E-Street/Springsteen song - that's incorrect. It's actually by Marc Cohn.As for the album, I love it - this pretty much sums up everything I enjoy about Springsteen's work. My one beef (or two beefs?) is that it doesn't contain ""I'm on Fire"" and ""One Step Up."" Apart from that, a great collection."
1,Abysmal collection from a great artist,"That someone actually had the ""cajones"" to put the title ""Greatest Hits"" on this mess is still mind-boggling. It is missing so many ""great hits"" that the title is truly insulting. For example, where is ""Tunnel of Love,"" ""One Step Up,"" ""Rosalita Come Out Tonight,"" ""Pink Cadillac,"" ""I'm On Fire,"" ""Prove It All Night,"" and ""Cover Me""? That's just to name a few of the MIA's from this travesty. So finally the 2-disc ""Essential"" comes out and all is well, right? Guess again. It too is an uneven, incomplete collection. Will someone please help us casual Boss fans with a single or 2-disc set that ""contains all the hits"" career retrospective of this man? There are a variety of ""box sets of B-sides"" and other esoterica from this artist, why not a decent hits collection? Don't buy this, it just isn't worth it."
2,"""Hits"" but not Greatest","Although this is a greatest hits collection, Bruce always poses a problem for compilations of this kind. Namely, his songs are alost universally better live. And his ""Hits"" are not close to his Greatest songs.There are exceptions: Thunder Road, Born to Run The River come to mind immediately. But this leaves out too many of his staple great songs to be worth a purchase. If this is your only Bruce purchase, your understanding of his music and why his fans are who they are will never come to be. Without Rosie, Jungleland, Sandy, Incident, and others, you are missing the Bruce mythos.Spend more money, go buy Live 1975-85, or buy Live in New York City. You will get a better overall picture of The Boss, and those albums are just magical."
3,"Compelling, but incomplete.","I guess when you try to whittle a dozen or so albums down to one disc, there is no way to expect it to be all-conclusive. This package does it's best, though many fans have come away unfufilled. It's not hard to see why, what with missing tracks like ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out"", ""Rosalita"" and ""Cover Me"". The list goes on to be sure, but what's left makes for a pretty damn impressive resume. From early anthems like ""Born To Run"" and ""Badlands"", the four ""U.S.A."" tracks and even his more thoughful later tunes like ""Human Touch"", it's all good to great stuff. With so many style shifts in Springsteen's long career, one can be glad at least that those shifts are captured here. Definately something for everyone, but not everything."
2,Bruce Sold Out,"The hits, are well known by all us fans. I must say I'm shocked ""The Boss"" claims he dropped the ball on the Wal-Mart deal. Are you kidding? He took millions from Wal-Mart and then throws them under the bus, all the while, taking their cash. Most of us shop at Wal-Mart and like shoping there for the great deals during these tough times. Maybe Bruce should donate his profits from the Wal-Mart sales to those millions who are struggling during these tough economic times. I love his music, put your money where your mouth is."
5,Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits,Love listening to The Boss. This album is a must for Springsteen fans. Good selection of great hits to enjoy!
4,Very good for the New Bruce fan,"This was a fairly good sampling of Bruce's career, but the makers of the compilation left nothing from the pre-Born to Run stage, and too much from the post-Born in the USA stage. I've never heard the E-Street Shuffle before, I had wanted to hear Rosalita. I've heard Greetings from Asbury Park, though, and I know that a few songs from that album deserved a place on here. It deserved three-and a-half stars as a compilation, but it easily deserves five stars as a source of good, quality music for all listeners."
4,A hits album but not the greatest,"Although it is a greatest hits album and has some outstanding songs on it, the album does lack the depth and diversity of music that Bruce displayed throughout his career. Isn't that the point of a greatest hits album? A broadstroke of one's career? Overall a solid album."
5,"Too much Born in the USA, but still a great CD!","I realize that Born in the USA was Bruce's biggest commercial success, but the four songs from that album on Greatest Hits do not even compare to Born to Run, Thunderoad, Badlands, The River, and Atlantic City. This CD is worth having for those songs alone; they are phenomenal! I was disappointed to see that Tunnel of Love was not included. Perhaps one of the oft-overplayed Born in the USA songs could be dropped to make room for it (I don't think My Hometown would be missed). Perhaps I'm giving the impression that I don't like the album, but it really is great for the early stuff and later gems like Streets of Philadelphia and Secret Garden (thankfully without ""you had me at hello""). I'm just a little tired of Born in the USA."
2,"5 stars for the diet, 2 stars for the book","I agree with the others that this book should be taken to ""heart"" (as well as the rest of the good- for-your-body food) but the message gets distorted after that. Even for a health-nut like me, the fanatical obsession with food gets boring. There seems to be an attempt to address social issues revolving around dysfunctional families but the thinking reader is left with an uncomfortable feeling that this is just a prelude for a wolf lurking in magicians clothing. The food may be good for you but the story is tasteless!"
1,"Quite possible the worst example of a ""horror"" book...","Three words best describe the book: cliche, trite, and garbage. The story is a pitiful twist on that seen in The Monkey's Paw among other stories. The characters are boring and unrealistic, the story is too fast paced, the ending is the epitome of cliche, and it fits the bill of bargain bin horror all too well: nice unnecessary, gory descriptions and a bit of nudity. Skip it. Maybe even burn it."
2,Ugh..,"I couldn't even finish the first volume of this sophomoric manga. The story develops lightning fast, making it a bit confusing. It feels like the author was in a huge rush with this manga. The story line isn't cohesive at all and doesn't flow very well. Every situation just seems so randomly placed, like a small child wrote it. Worst of all it's really cheesy, especially in the fact that it implicitly STATES that the setting is fictional....I mean how lame is that?The style and art are nice, but nothing exceptional. I prefer mangas with art that sets the mood by showing detailed images of the setting in between story development and dialogue. I didn't really see any of this in D. Gray-Man.D. Gray-Man might be enjoyable by a 10 year old boy with a short attention span, but not by most adult readers."
5,Wonderful,"I'm sure you don't want me to drabble on about what the book is about, so i wont ruin the story for you.The book is beautifully drawn, and although this is technically a horror manga, it has just the right amount of comedy mixed in. About all the characters are based on real people and their personalities are quite interesting.The story is also original, so you don't have to worry about boring yourself with it.Overall, I suggest this book to any manga lover, whether you love horror or not."
4,Almost all good,"I got the wristwatch on time, well-packed and in good order. Can recommed the company. Only thing which didn't match the order was that watch was Mickey Mouse watch, not Minnie, but for me it didn't matter. Hopefully they are more careful next time. I am basically satisfied."
5,A very interesting bit of history,"Pipes does a very fine job of eliciting from scant evidence the details of Degaev's personal story. And he exercises due caution in interpreting that evidence. The young Degaev, Russian ideologue and terrorist, emerges fairly distinctly from the evidence -- though one has the impression that there's more to his story than the available record indicates; the older Degaev, professor of mathematics in the midwestern US, emerges less distinctly. That these two Degaev's should have been one and the same person, is fascinating indeed. What the fact says about terrorism and the rise of terrorists is less clear to me. I think RP does well not to infer too much on this score. He leaves it to the reader to draw his/her own conclusions. TGA is an exemplary piece of historical reconstruction, and a very entertaining read."
5,good charlotte kicks baskets!!,This cd is great beyond all greatness. If you don't buy it you're missing out. BUT! it is NOT the only place you can find the click. Good Charlotte has re-released their cd w/ the click as the number 10 track. But still you need to buy this cd before I have to brainwash you all into purchasing it! While you're at it you can buy every other gc product you can find. It's all worth it
5,more to the story,"if you enjoyed rebbeca of sunnybrooke farm, you will enjoy this. it has some of the main things that atand out in rebbecas life. it also has a good ending that does not leave you hanging as much as the first book. i really liked this though it is jus alittle choppy."
2,"too much scent, sticky","Really wanted to like this product. However, it has some flaws.- The container isn't opaque, which means that the product is exposed to the sun. Retino - the key anti-wrinkle ingredient in this product - is known to break decay with exposure. So it should be kept in an opaque tube that is tightly sealed. That is not this product.- The smell is very strong, and they clearly color it and use tons of perfume. I can't imagine that this helps with anti-wrinkle or healing properties. But it does have the effect of driving my cat away at night because it is so strong.- After applying my hands become sticky. Really sticky. Strange feeling, like they're becoming puckered. I immediately have to wash them. I don't know what this is attributed to, but it's quite unpleasant.Overall, disappointed in this product. I don't think I'll be buying again. After doing some comparisons, I prefer the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream."
1,"Loaded with silica, did not get absorbed at all","This cream felt exactly like a primer, loaded with silica and it had a very strong perfume too. It felt sticy and did not get absorbed into my skin at all. I did not see any difference in the morning. I have been using this for 2 weeks. Will definitely go back to the total effects night cream. That one was a keeper."
2,Disappointed again!,I was anxious to try this product due to all the advertising hype but again felt it was only another moisturizer on the market but not something that made any definite changes in the skin. Hopefully they will find a product that will really make a difference. Probably have to spend more money than what this item costs.
3,"Good product, no miracles","I've been using this product for about 18 mos. The smell is fabulous, and it feels great on my skin. Absorbes quickly and is not greasy. Does not make my face breakout, and is great for very dry skin. As far as any other results, I haven't seen any changes."
3,Nice product,"Olay really has a nice product line. The scent of some of thier products are a bit strong for my taste but overall I am happy with them. Olay leaves my skin feeling more smoothe, and helps keep the dryness away. It also helps fade those annoying little age spots at bay. Two thumbs up Olay! I use Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment regularly."
3,It's just Okay,Disappointed. I am women of 65 and have dry skin. This was just like all the rest of the moisturizers.I could use vaseline and it would feel the same. Not worth the money.
5,Love It!,"This is a great product! It makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.I have seen an improvement in my skin after using this product. The price was very reasonable, too!"
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"There's nothing terribly wrong with this night cream. It moisturizers and keeps my skin soft, but that's all. I was hoping for something a little more radiant or more. This is by no means a ""night recovery""."
4,Recieved in a timely manor,Got this for my wife for Christmas. She didn't toss it so I guess she likes it.Product came in a timely manor concidering it was Christmas.
2,made me break out,"Everyone reacts differently, but this product irritated by skin and made me break out. Test it out on a small patch of skin to see how you react."
4,Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment 1.7 Ounce,"I like it, but find I just will not take the time to apply at night. When I used it I liked it very much."
5,Feels and works great!,"After washing face and applying this treatment, I was very pleased with the way it made my skin feel so smooth."
5,nothing better,"Olay products are the very best and this night cream is wonderful. It makes your skin feel so smooth, is not greasy goes on really well. it is as good as products that cost far more than this one does. Purchasing products in this manner quarantees that you will not run out."
5,Olay Regererist Night Recovery Is Amazing,I really love this product. It leaves my skin looking and feeling better. It does what it says it does and I would definately recommend it for anyone who is looking for an antiaging night time moisturizing product.
5,Night cream,"Now THIS Olay Regenerist I LOVE! This night cream is fluid and light, smells great, and I feel like it works! My face feels more toned, my lines not as ""obvious"" - I love this product."
1,Feels nice but NOT nice for your skin,"I have purchased this item several times before thinking that it made my skin smooth...BUT this product contains Mineral Oil!! I found out Mineral Oil coats the skin like plastic - clogging pores and creating a build-up of toxins. Mineral oil can slow cellular development, creating earlier signs of aging. Mineral oil also was implicated as a suspected CAUSE OF CANCER. Plus mineral oil can disrupt hormonal activity! Just say NO."
3,greese,"I orderthis by mistake,but sence it was olay I decide to try it.It is like olive oil on the skin but not as usefull.Just lays there allnight,nerver sinks in.I now use it in the morning on my hands to protect then during my house work.Gives a good treatment with gloves on. Lyn"
4,Use it every day,"I think is should be a good product. Since I am still young, I did not see good improvement on my face. Hope it works if I continue to use it"
4,"Feels good, but it'll be 10 years before we know if it works","This feels great on my face, doesn't make me breakout or cause any other bad side effects, and is pleasantly scented (and I'm sensitive to scents). But my theory on facial creams -- especially ""recovery"" products -- is that it takes 10 years to see the effects! I'll keep using it because of the way it feels and theoretically it's doing something good for my skin, but I don't expect to see results anytime soon."
2,Smelly,"I hate face products with smells, especially night time products. Hard to sleep with such an odor. Not so sure the product does anything either. I'll try a different brand, hopefully unscented."
2,Disliked the smell,"I saw many great reviews about this product and decided to buy one, only to find out that smell is a very subjective thing - many people found the smell great but I found it unpleasant and too strong. I use other products in the Olay Regenerist line, and found them smell fine. I would recommend others trying out the product before purchasing one."
2,"too much fragrance, gave me a headache","I really like Olay and have used it for years but they have slowly eliminated fragrance free products. I tried this moisturizer, and while my skin looked nice, the fragrance triggered a migraine. I am at the point where I need the Regenerist line but can't tolerate it. I am afraid I'll have to stop using Olay products. Olay, please offer Regenerist products in fragrance free! (Why do they need to put so much fragrance in moisturizer anyway?)"
5,The best working nighttime product out there.,"I only use about 1/4 teaspoon of this product every night applied to your face and I saw results after a week. I am 49 and my extremely dry skin lost all of the superficial, tight wrinkles but not the deeper ones around my mouth. This product disappears into your skin but hydrates it very well without that greasy or mask-like feel. It also smells wonderful."
4,"Absorbs quickly, and doesn't feel greasy","I like this product. It absorbs into the skin easily and quickly and has a light fragrance. Doesn't feel greasy either and doesn't cause redness or breakouts (at least in me). I've been using it for about six months and I can't say I see any difference in the reduction of fine lines or brown spots, but does anything really work for these? But the cream does feel nice. And the subscribe and save program is the best price I have found."
2,Strong perfume smell and too thick for me,"The strong scent was a turn off as soon as I opened it and I wish I had returned it immediately but I thought that I would give it a chance. After having it for 4 months, I can't bring myself to finish the jar. I really like it's sister productOlay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for Face and Neck, 1.7-Fluid Ounce, which is not as thick and is mild in scent. I've purchased MANY Olay products to find the best ones and this Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment wins the medal for strongest perfume smell. Since my nose can't handle it, I am unable to rate it's performance but it is too thick of cream for my normal-to-oily skin. Sorry, Olay, I can't rate it high like the rest of your products."
3,Way too much fragrance,"I'm surprised nobody has mentioned this. The amount of fragrance in this product is overpowering. It's a pretty floral scent, but just wayyyy too much of it. My husband asked me the other night why I put on perfume just to go to bed.I hesitate before putting it on now, though I think it actually does a nice job on my skin."
2,1 month,"Used regularly for one month, no visible result. I feel better about myself, doing something supposedly proactive for my skin. That is about it. Maybe it just takes longer than a month... to that I cannot reply. Only that it is NOT a one month miracle."
1,Ouch!,"I have just applied the cream, after having bathed and am breaking out. It is itchy and irritating my skin to no end. Horrible! I don't understand all the positive reviews...and I'm inclined to go back to only using cosmetics that have ingredients that I can understand!"
2,Bad Luck,I love Olay products but unfortunately this particular night cream made me break out. I used it for about a week before I realized what was going on and stopped immediately afterward. It's unfortunate I broke out because my skin was feeling smoother than normal. :(
4,Basic,"Good basic night cream. I use it every night. But, the light blue color threw me off at first. Not a magical potion, but for my price range, it's the answer. Have been using it consistently for the past month and think the product will last at least another month. For those of us on a fixed income (finally retired) this is very important.Linda from Florida"
2,thin layer of glyerin on my face,"I usually enjoy OLAY's product ok. It doesn't seem to do much for me, but doesn't irritate my sensitive skin either. However, this was absolutely the worse I've ever used. It smells nice, a bit too much fragrant for a face product though. It applies easily. However, this product is just way too waxy and won't absorb into my skin. Will not purchase again."
5,Love it,It's so moisturizing and light...it just feels wonderful applying this cream on a clean face before sleep....it smells awesome too.
3,Okay,"I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and I notice that my face is softer, but I haven't noticed any significant improvements in the texture of my skin. We will see! I love the smell!!"
1,Gave me acne!,"I agree with other reviewers that it feels good and doesn't smell too much, however, I've experimented with it several times to confirm my findings, and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads. I'm 25 with an oily t-zone and very dry facial skin. On mornings after using this cream, I have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin.There are better products out there!"
1,"OLAY VS ""$300"" cream","Well...the only reason for me to write this review- just to make clear to High-end users- THIS CREAM IS NOT! even close to expensive creams..I have been using LaMer (my favorite), Arden, Lancome (Absolute is the best in that line), Chanel, Pevonia( for sensetive skin) and of course as many of you I was attracted to the recent ads, claiming that Regenerist is better than all expensive brands. Oh my...))) trust me, if your skin tried the BEST- it will NOT accept an imitation.I gave Regenerist 3 weeks of try- every...EVERY time I am using it, my skin breaks in bumps, next morning it feel very greasy and definitely not refreshed.Anyway, to make my story short- you can try it ( 20 dollars not such a big loss) but you will come back to your $300 cream-since ITS WORTH IT!)))"
