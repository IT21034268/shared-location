3,"Great story, Not so great Kindle edition","This is a must read book for everyone, but will be enjoyed especially by lawyers and particularly by probate lawyers. This Kindle edition is pretty poor, however. Dashes or elipses have been transformed into obscure symbols. The is no way to jump to chapters. But having cost nearly nothing, I suppose one gets what one pays for."
5,A masterpiece,"I think I learned more about writing from this book than anything else I have read. Sure, Dickens was allowed to create a web of coincidence that editors would scoff at today. But Dickens was also pre-Freud, which means pre-what-we-know-as-psychoanalysis, so we don't get the traditional insights into the characters' heads that more contemporary fiction provides. Dickens won't tell us, ""she was depressed,"" or ""he was a codependent psychopath."" What he does do is accompany one character, always, by the drip, drip, dripping of rain; while another is surrounded by grease, and meets an ugly end via internal combustion. Imagine having to use the environment to show, not tell, a character's internal world! Bleak House is anything but bleak. It is a masterpiece."
1,Almost unusable edition,This book was so large that it is imposssile read without using a large desk. It also smells so bad from another room. Also the illustrations are blurred. I can't imagine why anyone would be happy with any of the Nonesuch Dickens
1,It's Certainly [Something]-House!,"I forced my fugitive eyes onto this book for the duration, just on the strength of 'David Copperfield', but it didn't repay the effort. You have to ask yourself: what possessed Dickens to write such a hack-job, which even shows some contempt for the reader. The answer is: the usual suspect -- the writer in the semi-autobiographical 'Copperfield' says: 'approbation' (fame).The more you look into Dickens, the more you realize -- the world's just not quite as rich as you thought it was."
3,You have the wrong information,I cancelled this book an hour after clicking on it. I was comparing the cost of your book with the cost of 2nd hand books.
5,Please delete my previous review oh any book,"Any book had sent me the wrong book, but they corrected the error and gave me a complete refund. I now have the Norton Ctitical Edition of Bleak House that is required for my class. I would use ""any book"" in the future.This book is very helpful in understanding the text."
5,Bleak House (Kindle Edition),"Bleak House by Charles DickensThis is one of my favorite Dickens works, and will keep you entertained for hours. Written in 1853, when Dickens was at his peak, Bleak House is often considered Dickens's best novel."
4,always love Dickens,he has such a way of describing. one of my favorites authors of all time. great to have access to classics
3,Bleak House,"The story line was very good and there were some very humerous parts as well. I like Dickens, but some of his sentences go on and on."
5,"A magnificent work, not to be missed","My thesis advisor at Birkbeck College, London,--Professor Geoffrey Tillotson--considered ""Bleak House"" the greatest English novel of the 19th century. This is only one of his opinions with which I heartily concur. Now that I am, myself, an older man, with decades of reading behind me, I can think of only two novels of the 19th century which can be mentioned in the same breath with this masterpiece: Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" and Dostoyevsky's ""The Brothers Karamazov."" I would hate to think of going through life without an intimate knowledge of each of them. It would be like never listening to Bach or Mozart, or Brahms. It would be a life of unnecessary deprivation."
5,One of his best,"I found this the best written prose that I have read so far by Dickens, and it ranks amongst the best written books that I've read by anyone. His assassination of the British establishment sometimes almost made me wince, yet I always found it entertaining and not preachy. I didn't find the plot as good, or the characters as sympathetic as A Tale of Two Cities (my favourite), but it beats the melodrama of Great Expectations by a long shot. I actually found this a far more damning indictment of society than Hard Times, contrary to what I'd been led to believe. Highly recommended."
5,My favorite Dickens novel,"It's hard to pick the best Dickens novel. Dickens himself favored David Copperfield and there is a lot to recommend that. But the novel of his that I most admire is Bleak House. It has a great range of characters, a personal mystery at its core, and the first detective in fiction. Dickens alternates the story-telling between the voice of the all-knowing author and that of the naive female lead character. From street sweepers to the lords and everyone in between, the dark theme of an impersonal social order and system grinding people up is remarkably like Kafka."
1,another ego trip,"Paul begins his memoir: ""in February 1996, I celebrated my 65th birthday. This was a landmark event for me.""The celebration of Paul's 65th birthday was not a landmark for me. And my guess is it was not for you either. I had never heard of him before picking up the book.Why Penguin published a book that appears to be one huge ego trip for a wealthy man mystifies me. Does Penguin published books on a subsidy basis? That could explain it"
2,Characters Lost Substance on Time Travel Romance!,Story started out with a bang then the characters fell apart and didn't seem to click to my thinking. I did like the relationship of Lachlan to his family and his country people. I'm not sure if I would read this author again.
4,Good Read,"The story was good, I could not put it down. But towards the ending it kind off looses a little of the magic. The ending needed more a little dissapointed towards the end."
2,Wish they would hold up better,"They sure are cute but have rapidly fallen apart. The soles separated from the shoes, the scuffs seem instant. Very displeased with the shoes."
4,Masterpiece.,"Great instrumentation, and programming that Vangelis is truly great at. Synthesizers, and great drum programming, especially on the track Alpha, in fact you'll have Alpha on repeat for days. Pulstar opens the album, and really sets the tone, amazing!"
5,Probably my favourite Vangelis album,"I know some people prefer his orchestral and choral mush but give me this side of Vangelis any day. This is by far his most free and creative album. No constrictions of compositional niceties cramping his work here. Jazz, rock, electronica. This is for me his most exciting album; it gets your pulse racing rather than merely tickling the intellect. I prefer the short version of Pulstar from the vinyl EP but this version still thrills.I just wish he'd produced more albums of this sort."
5,whoa!,Please do not take the brown acid while listening to this CD.....if you have taken the brown acid pls report to the medical tent.....thank you
3,So So,"This movie is a good old fashioned disney movie, clear cut good guy fighting the bad guy. Though the best film to relate this film to would beWhite Fang. Pretty much the same story, including the heart felt, get out of my life speech to the cheetah. Yet, still a good enough movie to want to own."
5,Very satisfied!,My family saw this film years ago and my daughters wanted to add it to our library. Delivered on time and in good condition. Very happy with service
3,Cheesy flashback,"We had bought a similar movie, Duma, which my family absolutely loved and thought this might be similar. Watching Cheetah was a total 80s flashback--I had no idea this movie was out in the 80s but now that makes total sense given the wardrobe, the tube socks, the hair, etc. I had assumed that it had been shelved way back when and was brought out because of the success of Duma. The movie is enjoyable for a once-through. Duma is MUCH better."
1,Oh...my...gosh...,"Incredibly bad. 90% of the (very brief) animal scenes weren't even filmed on the same film stock as the rest of the movie! Every time they cut to an animal, suddenly the picture gets all grainy. Can you say, ""Stock Footage""? After seeing this turkey you will.Absolutely typical Disney gotta-have-a-villain story, only watered down beyond belief. This thing doesn't play like a made-for-Disney-Channel quickie, it plays like a BAD made-for-Disney-Channel quickie. If you love your children, don't buy this thing.If you want to see how the same basic story can be done better without the need for a Disney villian, have a look at the movie ""Duma"". (Which isn't a great movie, but anything's better than Disney's ""Cheetah"".)"
5,Excellent expansion/supplement to Vol. I,Tries to cover as many (other-than cacti) succulents as possible that weren't covered in 1st book! Would recommend both Volumes!
1,Wrong Region Code,"Before I buy a dvd I make sure that the Region Code is either 1 for Canada U.S. or Region Free/0. This product states in product description as being region 1 U.S. and Canada only which would be perfect for me but when I received it I was disappointed to see that it is Region 2,3,4,5, which will not play on any of my 5 dvd/blu-ray players. What a waste of money and false advertising. Buyer beware."
5,Vintage Ray: The Real Thing,"If you liked Jamie Foxx's performance in RAY, you will love this DVD. It's from 1963, the same timeframe as the movie, with the actual people you see featured in the movie including David ""Fathead"" Newman and Margie Hendrix.The first ""show"" is actually a rehearsal (probably both for the band and the camera operators) and is of stellar quality considering it's 40 year old video. The actual show (the second ""set"") has some annoying video quality and sound buzz, but who really cares? The DVD is very watchable, especially considering most of the songs in the actual show were also captured in high quality during the rehearsal.While later Ray concert DVDs are of perhaps better video quality (e.g. color), they miss the magic of Ray performing at the very peak of his career (he had already released ""Modern Sounds"" by the time of this performance).If you are a Ray Charles fan, just buy this. You won't be disappointed."
2,This Device is a nightmare WPA,"Version 4.92 seems to be unstable in reguards to WPA security, makeing this device almost useless. To help ensure stablity do not use SSID with spaces or symbols, but even that doesnt work at times. WEP and unsecure this device runs like a champ. WPA seems like Linksys put the lazy developer in charge of that area of programming,, ***FAIL****"
1,Buy the WETG54G Bridge and switch seperately,"When my WET54G bridge died on me, I thought I'd get this version of the product...Very disappointing. This version of the product was unreliable, as compared to the bridge-only version. It was unable to keep connections, and seemed slow to initiate connections. I rebooted it frequently in order to get connections...The WETG54 product never had a problem -- until the day it died. It served me very well.The moral of the story -- sometimes seperate components are better than combinations. Stick to the components.The WETG54S5 is not worth the trouble."
1,Doesn't work out of the box.,"I had high hopes for this product, the Linksys WET54GS5, ethernet bridge with a 5-port switch. I use a Linksys wireless router, and have used their products before, with great success. It seems my luck has run out.I wasted an hour trying to get this thing to connect. I have a secure wireless network, using 64bit WEP. I know the network works, because I've using this network to write this review.However, after several hours of configuring, rebooting, toggling the bridge's power, toggling my pc's power, and even the router, nothing works. I configured the device using the web app, but it still wouldn't work.I have to give this one a big thumbs down. It doesn't work."
5,Bleeding Blue and Gray: Civil War Surgery and the Evolution of American Medicine,"Excellent! What a research project that Dr. Rutkow undertook with this book and then gave it back to us in an interesting, informative read! Thought I might get bored with all the history details and names, but I did not. Funny how much of the major movements in healthcare came with our experiences with war. Thought Vietnam was primarily the determinate change, but the Doc shows us how medicine evolved during the Civil War, but stayed stagnant at the same time. Read the book!"
5,' Behold ' -Ian Dury and the Blockheads,"The combination of Ian Durys' funny , tragic ,witty lyrics , delivered in his very own' droll' and unique style , along with the brilliant ,as usuall, artistry of the ' Blockheads , makes this album for me an absolute ' gem ' . So many great tracks .Ian dury passed away in recent years . He should be considered a National Bloomin' Treasure ! ( A pommy geezer of course )"
5,Lifetime Running on New Balance,"I have been running on top of the line New Balance for over 15 years. I'm overweight and pronated. As a 50+ year-old runner, I'm more interested in running tomorrow than if I got a personal best today. New Balance minimizes my injuries better than the other four top shoes I've tried from four other brands."
4,excelent shoes for running,"This is an excelent shoe for running in and, being in the military I do quite a bit of running. I have found this shoe to have great shock absobtion like most new balance shoes but, this one is better than most. I would recomend this shoe to any avid runners out there I only wish it cam in more colors."
3,didn't get exactly what I wanted,They didn't have the color I wanted so I settled for a different color shoe.
5,A tiny if very complete history,"The History Of Japan by R. H. P. Mason and J. G. Caiger is a very small yet very complete book of Japanese history and culture, from 10,000 BC up to the 1950s. Maps, photos, quotes and a small bibliography add delight and swift understanding to a very complex subject. Perfect gift for a person just showing interest in Japanese or Asian history. Deals with the major points, the changing twists and turns, in Japan during its history. It also deals with the culture, the religions, the development of city life, the arts, the political and industrial changes with just the right amount of information."
3,Meh... Decent.,"This book is really dense, but I suppose that's because it's a book on the history of a very ancient country. It reads like a very boring old-fashioned book, but it is very rich in detail, going back thousands of years all the way to nearly the present. I suppose it's good if you have a lot of spare time and are REALLY interested in the subject."
5,A very interesting exciting animated story for young children.,My 4 year old grandson enjoyed watching and discussing the many exciting adventures that was going on with Tiny and his little rabbit friends.
2,NOT THE BOUNTY WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE,"Whereas Bounty 2-ply is exalted by both Procter & Gamble and everyone that uses it, this product is basically not up to the same par. If you want an excellent 1-ply product buy ""Viva"". If you are simply looking to pay as little as possible, try something like the ""KROGER PREMIUM BRAND"", Winn-Dixie's ""Deep-South"" or the ""SHOP-RITE BRAND"".To their credit, however, Bounty makes NO GRAND performance claims about this ""Basic Bounty"" 1-ply product.[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]"
4,Fun Little Toy,"I bought this for my girlfriend but she never really wears it on her keys like its meant to, it would be a little obvious if someone were to actually see it on her keys. We have had our share of fun with this toy. It is loud and has a pretty strong vibration, but fun to use. Downside is that there really isn't much control over the speed. And unless you're having fun with it at a park or empty feild in the middle of the night, it will probably be heard as it's pretty loud, unless you have your own place, which then you might just want to invest in something a little better. But, it's conveniently small and easily fits insde small pockets. Great for those occasions were you can't bring an actual full size vibrator or need a little more concealment. Also great for those longer trips in the car!"
3,"Wow, They Weren't Kidding!","Looks great. Yes, it should be fine for a couple of teenagers horsing around. BUT, it could do some serious damage (not the fun kind). It is incredibly hard and could break fingers. I believe the age-old adage, ""you'll poke your eye out"" applies perfectly to this sword. It is far too dangerous for the Nerf crowd."
3,Looks nice but way too hard for most LARPS,"First off the sword looks great and is well designed. But the foam they use is very hard, almost plastic like. Very few if any LARP organizations will approve this sword as being safe. Hopefully the ones they make in the future will use a softer foam."
4,Beck is back on top of the heap of guitarists,"Jeff Beck may be in his mid-50's, but he's still the best living guitarist. In fact, I believe he's the best guitar player who's ever lived. He's not the complete musician that John Lennon or Jimi Hendrix were, but when it comes to just playing, there's no one who can touch him....never was, never will be. Oh yeah, this album kicks major a** and the show was fantastic!!! Let's just hope that it's not another 9 or 10 years between this and his next release."
4,New Music?,"Hey, Jeff Beck never ceases to innovate, re-create and demonstrate his prowess on the guitar. This batch of tracks will take a few listenings for some, others will like it immediately but always discover nuances. Tone, Taste, Tenacity... this guy either loves his work or he's just banging out product to keep his cars running and rice in the bowl. It's difficult to imagine having his talent. He probably doesn't appreciate his gift as much as his audience does, too bad... indulge us next time will you Jeff."
2,disapointed,not my tastea mistake for metoo hardlack of melodiesi'll get no emotions with that musicbad purchase
4,A classic I had lost track of,"I somehow never managed to collect any Jeff Beck when he was at the height of his popularity. But after hearing ""THX138"" on one of my favorite internet radio stations, I felt I had to have it. Better late than never."
3,A Hypothesis,"Imagine.... if this release had a money back guarantee, Jeff Beck would have lost a sizable amount of working capital. Sorry... there are sparks onboard, but... overall, it doesn't rate a hyper 5-stars. Hopefully Mr. Beck will hire a bassist and a real drummer... for some future recording dates. L8tr"
3,J.B. Toad was just experimenting......,"Hey everybody, I'm a J.B. nut, but i was left a bit dissapointed. Many of the tunes were simply riffs played again and again while Jeff would tease us with some fill-ins. Declan is my favorite, very haunting indeed. Still he is without a doubt my all time favorite. Im happy I got to see him play and of course, he blew the audience away.... P.S. check out CRAZY-LEGS, now there is some incredible playing real mind blowing blistering BECK!!!!!!!!!"
2,Too much techno,"This CD was different from what I had expected. I like Jeff Beck, especially his 80s albums. But herein is too much techno and too less Jeff Beck. I'd rather be listening to ""Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop"" with the great Terry Bozzio on drums and Beck really rocking on the rocky tunes and really sensitive on the soft ones."
2,There is not any classic Beck tracks,"I was kind of disappointed after I heard ""Who Else?"" I didn't seem to find it appealing musically. There isn't, in my opinion any tracks that I would deem classic Beck. I don't hear anything that equals a ""Jeff's Boogie"", ""Beck's Bolero"", ""Freeway Jam"", ""Blue Wind"" ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"" or ""Where Were You."" I love Jeff Beck but this album just does not do it for me. He took too long to release an album of new material, and with this happening, my interest in Beck is declining."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Jeff Beck has as unique and interesting a guitar sound as anyone I have ever heard play the instrument. His playing on ""Who Else?"" is quite good, and, in spots, outstanding. I never seem to get tired of that sound.However, the digital percussion electronics and sequencing are overdone, and simply do not add anything to the overall quality, and frequently detract from the overall effect of the music, in my view. And I am frankly quite surprised that Jeff used the digitals to this extent. It was an effect used sparingly, and wisely so, on ""There and Back."" It was used too much in ""Guitar Shop."" And now we have even more in ""Who Else?""I'm not terribly fond of the trend Beck appears to be setting.But I love his guitar playing."
5,"It may be 90's, but it's still magnificent...","Jeff proves with this album that he's definitely not ""washed-up"" by any stretch of the imagination. ""Brush With The Blues"" proves it. Listen to the ear-piercing howl of his guitar at 3:02 into the song. Unbelievable. And ""Angel (Footsteps)"" contains the most BEAUTIFUL notes to ever emanate from a guitar. It's just as simple as that."
2,Who Else? Who Cares?,"I love Jeff Beck's music, and he has been influential to me in the 35 years I've played rock. But this album is just a collection of noodling, nothing more. I've listened to it several times trying to read between the lines but now put it away for good. Turn it all the way up and play it at a party, but this sounds like someone hid a microphone in his practice room on a rainy day when he'd really rather have been playing soccer outside."
3,Not one of Beck's Best,"Jeff Beck has redefined his playing more than once since the 1960s, but so have all of the great fusion players from the 1960s/1970s. There is no arguement that Beck made his biggest mark with the classic ""Blow By Blow"".On this album, Beck's playing is good; it's the music that suffers. There is not a lot to grab on to and the synth makes the thing sound muddy. It has taken Beck too long to release an album like this. If Beck could have teamed up with a group of talented jazz players, I think things might have been different.For my money, ""Vital Tech Tones"" by Henderson/Smith/Wooton, or ""Cause and Effect"" by Coryell/Coster/Smith are much more satisfying - those guys really burn."
2,I fail to see the creativity jamming along with a sequencer.,"I found this CD to be rather disappointing. As a bass player of over 20 years and a Beck fan from many years back (especially blow by blow and wired) this CD came accross to me as thrown together without much thought put into arranging real tunes.(A friend suggested to me that maybe he's stuck in some kind of contract and had to put something out) Seems like Beck's just jamming along with a sequencer. Great to come up with ideas, but why put it out on disc? Of course he is one of the greatest and most original guitar players ever and I'm going to see him in concert this Friday in Detroit."
1,What is this?,"I was expecting blues or classic rock. I figured he was in the Yardbirds, so this must be similar to it. MAN, was I wrong. This is......BAD!"
5,It is perfect!!,What can we expect from Jeff Beck? The most brilliant guitar album in the world! You have to listen to that! It's perfect as well as everything he does! That's it! Buy it now!
5,A brilliant piece of work from the GREATEST guitarist around,"I have been a Jeff Beck fan since 65 and the days of the Yardbirds. He has never failed to surprise and amaze me with his guitar pyrotechnics and brilliance, and this new CD (Who Else) is no exception. This is highly recommended and a must for any serious music fan and collector. His new band is simply wonderful. I saw him in concert in Cincinnatti at the Taft Theatre and he simply shell shocked the audience with a thundering wall of sound. If you ever have a chance to catch him in concert by all means do it. My hat is off to you Jeff. Just keep on doing it man."
4,fun album w/a different concept,"I bought it because of the incorporation of techno beats/synths with southern blues/rock style guitar (never heard that combo before).When I first got the CD, however, I didn't like it. I felt the playing was, overall, sloppy and I couldn't stand ""Brush with the Blues"" (too long and doesn't quite fit in w/the rest of the album). Fortunately, it's grown on me. I now think every song is really cool...even BWTB. Word is, Beck's style has always been sorta sloppy, yet way advanced - it's his trademark technique.Don't know why it annoys me so, but ""Angel"" is an exact replica of ""Behind the Veil"" from his Guitar Shop album...he just changed the name.This is the first Beck album I've ever heard/bought and, being a technical guitar freak (DiMeola, G.Howe, Morse, etc.) I find this type of guitar music very grounding and pure. (Would buy some of Jeff's older stuff, but it sounds horribly dated)"
3,You Get What You Pay For,"The sizing is materially off. These run a half size large in length and two sizes large in width. The laces are way too long and began to fray and unravel after a dozen wearings; you should replace the laces right out of the box. The leather is very soft; it scuffs and cuts easily. The rubber soles are likewise thin and very soft. These are not shoes that are going last long with daily wear, so plan accordingly. Having said that, the price is right. Buy a new pair when these wear out."
4,"ummmm, very good but a bit decieving","i just recieved this watch about 1 hour ago,, i have no plans to return it. first of all, it is a man's watch. by that, i mean a big and musculine watch ,, i like the color integration, its heavy, but good heavy. its a quality watch u can be sure. the manual is so easy to read. the only thing i didnt like about the watch , was that it looked brighter in the pic, the colors are a bit pale , i dont know if thats amazon's fault or the company's fault though,, i definately like the watch , no regret.. especially for 99 bucks, such a bargin"
5,Pleased,Ordered for my husband and son. Very pleased of quality of product for the price. Would reccommend it to others.
2,cheap construction,Notice there's no towing strength . .There's a reason. Used my Jeep to tow a tree limb to the back yard. It almost broke while doing it. 2 strains broke. Also the hook retainers are very cheap. I had had it for a few years and shouldn't have dry rotted if that was the problem.Ordered another brand today.
3,Not as well done as the others....,"I'm a big fan of the Creatures Fantastic video series. But I really felt disappointed in Creatures Fantastic: Dragon. In fact, the fist half seemed to be not about dragons AT ALL but crocodiles. If I wanted a documentary on crocodiles, I would watch the Nature Channel. (Sigh). What I've always liked about the Creatures Fantastic series is that it focuses upon the mythic legends surrounding each creature. Apparently the researcher had some trouble finding enough to take up a half hour, which is too bad, because there are plenty of dragon myths out there.This video has only one short about St. George and the Dragon, and a few screenshots of China. I guess its frustrating, because I expected so MUCH more. While I didn't care for CF: Dragon, I can highly recommend Creatures Fantastic: Bird and HORSE. They were much better filmed and researched."
5,If you hold an FAA certificate -- you need this book!,"Several years ago, while attending Emery-Riddle Aeronautical University, this book was used as our textbook for Aviation Law. To this day, anytime I get on the subject of Aviation Law, I recommend this book to anyone who holds an FAA certificate. I'm a Maintenance Supervisor for a major airline and have suggested it to my employees who have found themselves in less than desirable situations involving enforcement actions. They always come back to me with the same comment; ""I wish I had read this book before I got into trouble."" Learn from their mistakes - read the book before you NEED the book. It's short and to the point, you won't be sorry!"
5,Is This A Great Moment ?,"Can you imagine being dropped off in Anarctica with a video camera and trying to find interesting things going on, and enough of them to where you could somehow produce a decent 100-minutes-long documentary? I don't think I would fare so well with such a project, but somehow this documentary completey succeeds on all levels. There might be a boring moment there, a boring moment here, but overall the film is very interesting from beginning to end. While interviewing people this guy doesn't hold back at all, he goes right to the meat of whatever the matter could be, regardless of whether while doing so he sounds insane or not. I have a great amount of respect for that. And Anarctica is a beautiful place, one that definetely attracts its fair share of interesting folks as well. I'll definetely be buying this one, fully recommended."
3,"Decent, but not great!","As a fellow traveler of the world, I felt the movie did little justice for the sense of adventure I normally receive while seeing something new. However, the movie did show how interesting the people are in such an austere location and the movie contained some beautiful scenes.Unfortunately, many of the peoples stories were cut short and the interviews were poor. The movie seemed to attempt showing both the beauty of Antarctica and the interesting people who visit there, but it did not excel at either in my opinion."
2,"Quite good; my problems were with some of the researchers, not the filmmaker","I endured watching that Waddell seal being bagged because I told myself it was for some greater good; that something about that milk would prevent the extinction of a species or cure cancer in humans. Imagine my disgust to find out that the research being done was in ""human weight loss."" Now, please tell me the ""weight loss"" being talked about is the unintentional cachexia experienced by people or animals with disease and is not going to form the basis for the next big Phen-fen, from which some pharma company will make billions of dollars catering to a lot of obese humans, all on the back of that harmless seal who was minding her own business and could, as I do, give a scheit about human weight loss. Someone, please."
5,A Nature Film About People,"As director Herzog says early on in the voice-over narration, this is not a film about ""fuzzy penguins."" This is a beautiful, stunning film about Antarctica but especially about the people and creatures Herzog encounters in his explorations of the continent, from philosophers driving heavy machinery to a journeyman plumber who claims to be descended from Aztec royalty to penguins who seem to be wandering off into the unknown and to certain death. Herzog seeks out and finds the unexpected and the amazing, and he does so with his usual deadpan style. He focusses on the big picture as well as the small details, and if it doesn't all add up to a unified whole, at least it makes you think and leaves room for mystery. If you enjoy nature films, you will enjoy this film; if you enjoy films about unusual people, you will enjoy this film; if you enjoy films that surprise you, you will enjoy this film. I found it fascinating on many levels, and I highly recommend it."
1,"region 2, therefore won't play on my machine","i don't recall this being mentioned, but it was used and is no longer listed on the Amazon site, so i don't know if it was my oversight (i've bought hundreds of dvd's online, so i probably didn't overlook a detail like that). be careful, guys!"
3,All those Circles in a Box = a Big Zero,"Disappointed. The only variety is color. Only 2 pieces of wood were not round or a different size. Something's changed. I've owned large parrots for over 20 yrs. I purchased this product, in a much larger box, many times & thought it was great. Lots of shapes & the value was better. These round discs take up so much space In the box, you don't get many. No value here, & certainly less enrichment for really smart parrots. Wonder why they stopped making the cool shapes...which would allow the box to have more pieces. I'm going to keep looking. Not doing this again...."
5,An acknowledged masterpiece,"This is the brilliant book that made Richard Southern's reputation as one of the finest medieval historians. Everything that the two earlier reviewers have said is true and needn't be repeated. The bottom line is this: if you are very interested in the subject, and have already read about it to some extent, then you must read this book. It is astonishly rich in ideas -- almost too much so; and many of the observations that Southern makes in a seemingly casual way can give such blinding insight that you may find yourself stopping for several minutes at a time just to marvel at what you've read.One the other hand, this book is for serious students of history (it was originally devised for a college course). Those casually interested in finding out ""what happened"" in the middle ages will find it boring and useless."
3,Good combination,"This album is pretty straight-forward metal-- thrash with a melodic twist to it. The cover art is by Pushead, and the producer is Glenn Danzig, so you know that some heavyweights were involved in this creation."
3,Pretty Bland,"I have their brown sugar product and it is very good. I thought that the strawberry would be just as good. Boy was I wrong. First of all, they are very sweet but there is very little strawberry flavor unless you are really are paying attention, which in the final stages of swallowing, you get a slight hint of strawberries. The color of the filling looks like apples not strawberries."
2,Not Fresh - Made me think twice about buying bulk.,I purchased this item after my children enjoyed this exact favor + blueberry purchased from Costco. But they said this item sent from Amazon tasted different - not fresh. Now I have four more boxed that I have no idea what to do with.
2,NO FLAVOR Not as good as Pop Tarts,"I am surprised by all the positive reviews for these. We try to buy a lot of organic food so I thought these would be perfect. First off, it's hard to tell what flavor they are. They certainly dont taste like strawberry, maybe more like apple. And they are much harder than pop tarts. My kids wont eat them at all so now I have a huge case just sitting here."
1,contains MSG!,"whey protein isolate... rice extract... two sources of MSG. skip this and all of 'natures path' products. theyre tainted.if you think that organic means safe, think again. monosodium glutamate can be considered ""organic"" or ""natural"".watch these trickster ingredients, friends. if youve made the leap to organic, you have to dump the MSG from your diet too. get researching if you dont know about monosodium glutamate."
5,Mmmmmmm delicious!!,"I liked pop tarts okay, but hated that they were so processed and probably full of a lot of junk. I was shopping at Costco and saw this little slice of heaven and put it in the cart. I went through 3 boxes of these suckers in 2 weeks. Now, that probably wasn't the healthiest thing to do (they're a lot healthier than pop tarts mind you) but I literally had these sometimes for lunch and dinner but most definitely for breakfast! I had to take a break from getting these because I was in a word, addicted LOL. I recommend these to all!"
5,Great item,"Solid, sweet, attractive and practical for photos/jewelry/trinkets. There's also a similar box with a photo-frame top, but that has just two compartments while this one has three. And the solid, plain top makes it more versatile. I'll likely buy a several more of these in the future."
1,save your time and money,"I finally got fed up and skipped to the end only to find a self serving cliff hanger, meant to induce you to buy the next book. A good editing would have made it a little easier to read since the grammar would have been improved but the plot and characters are irritatingly thin."
5,Possibilities The Book,When I started this book was on a Sunday morning.. I finally finshed it sometime Sunday night.. I could not put if down. It was spell binding and I really enjoyed it. I look forward to the next book in the series. If you enjoy a good romance than I highly recomend this book.
1,Junior-high -- the writer and her readers,"Worst-written (and evidently not edited, or edited by a neighbor) piece of anti-heroine crap I've read in a long time. Stiff and stilted dialog, stereotypical characters, 1950s era racism and sexism -- I read the first few pages, glanced through the rest of it, and threw it in the trash. Nora isn't a heroine, she's a spoiled-brat victim, orphan or not. If you liked the women in ""Father Knows Best,"" and if you can imagine a woman who would leave her husband and consider filing for divorce WITHOUT confronting her husband with her suspicions and actually communicating her unhappiness -- then you'll love Janet Sue Terry's stuff. Straight out of 1950. If you'd rather read about real women who overcome real problems (instead of the kind you make for yourself), pick up Deborah Smith's Blue Willow, or order a couple of Nora Roberts' trilogies."
5,Excellent album,"This album has 15 songs + 1 bonus Mega Mix. It has 8 remixes of their best songs, which are just great + 7 new solid songs such as I Will B By your side. If you like that type of music this is a definite buy."
4,The redone music was satisfactory.,"After listening to the CD, I though they did a better job at remixing, compared to Mondern Talking and CC Catch. The back ground music was set for the 1990's, but their stlye of singing was 1980ish. I would have given 5 stars if they would have sung at a faster beat. Next time they do resings Bad Boys Blue needs to sing faster, then they would be set for the modern music industry."
4,My Great Grand Father,I am William Minto (wminto@talk21.com) the great grandson of Professor William Minto and I am undertaking some research into the family and if anyone can profer an extract of this or can give me furthet information I would love to hear from them
2,Okay Quality,These are a very thin and shiny microfiber --in the 70's we called them polyester. Not at all what I expected.
5,"Excellent resource, great teaching tool","After checking this book out of our library three times, I bought it and loaned it to our Watercolor class teacher. We used it in several sessions, the budding artists had fun and with the step by step instructions, created some very nice work. Four or five of the students purchased their own copy of this book. It is helpful for any level of watercolor skill."
5,Makes a bad unit work again,"These sensors are prone to permanent damage if they are splashed with hydrocarbons, which was the case with mine. The mounting location should be carefully considered and the directions followed to prevent needing a replacement sensor. In most applications the sensor can be mounted considerably above the hull bottom (at starter level) which gives a cushion to avoid sensor contamination. Mine was mounted too low and dead center in the bilge, rather than along the side, which made it very susceptible to contamination."
3,Size?,"The shirt is good quality, however the size of the shirt is not standard. The medium fits more like a small. Sizing should be more clear."
4,Good tutorial of basic control system,"This is a really good book that simplified control system for the real world. Most text spend too much time on theory and analysis and end the discussion with a bunch of equations and graphs without explaining how to implement the design. This book covers both analog and digital control, and lets you download a software from the author's web site. This software, ModelQ, lets you play with various parameters so you can see how the system behaves when it is not optimized.One drawback with the book is it only covers PID control and its variants, but doesn't cover state-space control. While state-space control may be considered ""overkill"" by many control engineers, state-space is used in industry. The decision to use state-space is often not in the hands of individual engineers, so it may not be an option to ignore state-space. It would be nice if Mr. Ellis could cover state-space in his next edition of the book."
1,reader from New York City,I've bought a couple of the other books in this series and I have to say that this one was a total diappointment. The crafts in this book were just so ordinary. I was hoping for some unique crafting ideas but only got some projects that I probably did as a Brownie or Girl Scout. Not worth the money.
4,So good I searched for it after reading it years ago,Another good ghost story. I remember reading this book years ago and I finally found it again on Amazon of course. A nurse with psychic abilities and a loving family though dead that still make their love felt. I enjoyed it!
3,Tracklist,"Tracks:--1: MAGGIE'S FARM--2: IDIOT WIND--3: IF DOGS RUN FREE--4: I THREW IT ALL AWAY--5: SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK BLUES--6: LIKE A ROLLING STONE--7: ONE TOO MANY MORNINGS--8: TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN', The--9: BALLAD OF FRANKIE LEE & JUDAS PRIEST, The--10: SHELTER FROM THE STORM--11: IT AIN'T ME BABE--12: MOST LIKELY YOU GO YOUR WAY--13: BUCKETS OF RAIN--14: FOOT OF PRIDE--15: TOMORROW IS A LONG TIME--16: IT'S ALL OVER NOW, BABY BLUE--17: SONG TO WOODY--18: I THREW IT ALL AWAY"
3,Somewhat disappointing overall,"I was really quite disappointed by this DVD overall. There are some real highlight dances (and they luckily make up for the rest) which is why I've given it 3 stars. The performances which held my attention and had more variety of pace were Ariellah, Sashi, Shakra, Sera & Solstice. I also liked the Mata Hari Dance by Sarah Skinner which was interesting and told a story, and Elsa Leandros dance was mesmerising if only to see if the spiked balls would hit anything. The rest felt very much that they were 'posing' and 'posing with props' and with little real skill or substance in the dances, or they lacked pace and variety. I would have liked to have seen more of a story and links between the dances - The Dark Masquerade with the Venetian masks hinted at a mystery which never materialised..."
2,Not what I expected,"This video is basically just a really, really long dance show. Some of the dances are interesting, but a lot of them are boring. Blanca is an amazing dancer, and I bought this dvd when I saw that she was in it. But, she is not featured dominantly as the cover might suggest. I was hoping that there would be drills or a choreography to learn, but there are not. This dvd does not seem to be put together in a professional manner, some of the dances are even interrupted by strange video sequences. This video could be much better. This is not to say that the dancers are not talented beautiful dancers, they just could have been showcased in a more professional way."
2,Total Letdown,"After watching a myriad of gothic bellydance videos on youtube, I was severely disappointed by this DVD. Ariellah's routines were great, as were Shakra's, but that was about it.Neon's, in particular, will make you wonder what the hell you bought. Her first 'number', set to an incredibly obnoxious track of talking and rhythm, has an interlude of what looks like MSPaint comics. Yeah, seriously.And then there's the ""Feminine""...things. Which are, at best, ridiculous and at worst, obnoxious and boring as hell. Unless you're interested in watching some sparkle-clad chick run around and fondle herself in a bodysuit, two badly painted ladies wiggle around a bedsheet for five minutes, or whatever that last one was (I skipped it, I couldn't take it anymore), either avoid this DVD entirely, or be ready to punch the ""Skip"" button frequently. Very frequently."
3,good show!,"This DVD is more of a show to appreciate every aspect, including music, costuming and scenery with belly dance than to really focus on the dancing.Most of the DVD is quite good and you can really appreciate every movement and the dancers really get you into the goth vibe, but is also a piece that is not even closely related to dance, they are just standing still looking from one direction to another for the whole piece."
3,"Overall, fun to watch","This DVD has a few great performances. Several good performances. And a couple that made me wonder what in it is considered belly dance. Camera angles don't get too weird, lighting is creative, choreography is fun to watch, the songs are interesting and varied to say the least. I have had the great privilege to take a seminar with Ariellah and she is my favorite. I was happy to have purchased this used, however, paying full price would have been disappointing. All in all, I enjoy it for the price I paid and have watched it twice in the 2 weeks I've had it. I totally plan on using a few steps in my own choreography. I would certainly recommend this DVD."
3,2 Awesome Performances - the rest just so-so,"This DVD is worth buying if you can get it cheap/used. I wouldn't pay full price. I treasure it for the Shakra performance and one other exceptional dancer (Blanca?). If you like Shakra as much as I do ... their piece makes the DVD worth owning.After those 2 pieces, I found the other material a bit pretentious or boring. Your mileage may vary - especially if you are more into goth culture than I am. I judge only the Dance and Choreography."
1,Big disappointment,"I was really looking forward to getting this DVD and am now regretting it. Wearing black doesn't make a 'gothic' belly dancer. There are some good performances on the disk but they're few and far between. I ended up skipping through all of the interpretive dances, isis wings and standard cabaret routines trying to find something remotely 'gothic' or even something unique. Of the 23 performances, only 4 I would watch a second time."
4,Wierd. random metal,"(4-1/2 stars) This beast has a most peculiar construction. I have never been fully able to embrace any of the three Mind Over Four records I own completely - but at the same time I love everything that they do. Part of it is lead singer Spike Xavier's ""boldness"" is definitely an acquired taste ( but in a good way, like Peter Hammill or Fish). Mike Jensen's Iommi-meets-Fripp guitar work is very unorthodox. This is definitely the boldest plate of their catalog - its possible to get completely lost in the dense, beautifully bizarre arrangements in both ""The Goddess"" and the ultra-heavy ""Gemini."" And you just KNOW that any metal album with ""Hell's Bravest Song"" has gotta rock silly."
4,none,"Captivating and daring, original and alien. McMullen's 'GreatWinter Trilogy' is destined to be regarded as one of the most powerful and provocative SF trilogies of the new millennium... Gary S. Potter Author/Poet"
3,A disappointing conclusion to the trilogy,"I was very disappointed by this book. Souls in the Great Machine is a wonder of invention, characterization and cleverness. A highly recommend book. And the second book is also a pretty good read. So I was disappointed by this conclusion to the epic. I wanted to learn a lot more about the Mirrorsun and Great Winter and human calculators, but things get all muddled. Even the war isn't too clear. I guess my disappointed is so big because the first two books set such a high standard, so this third effort doesn't measure up."
5,Great replacement + keyboard,"This keyboard is, by far, my absolute favorite of the ones made by Apple. It has a bouncy feel which on everything after the G3 was lost. As for this keyboard specifically, it snapped in easily, and also arrived in great condition. The keys are quiet and fluid, and are very responsive.As a sidenote, I would strongly recommend to very carefully pry the aluminum back off the keyboard, and use (sparingly, as not to destroy the keyboard) rubbing alcohol to remove the adhesive as it will prevent the famous scent from coming up from the keyboard later on."
3,Is Pretty good for beginners!,"Final Cut is a very fun program for somebody who is new to the world of editing... It doesn't have a good explination on how to use the program on its books... If the books were more detailed about how to do something, it'll be easier to learn how to edit...I spent a lot of time on the phone asking other people where do i do something because the books doesn't provide all the info you need...At the end you get the job done somehow!"
3,Great for PROS,"Nice program- does what it says- and edits DV or HD DV fine with 8, 10, 16, 22, or 24 bit sound.... but wait- you might be saying, what about the most common form of sound recorded on earth- 12 bit sound.... nope- no way- no means to make it work.... now- if you are a serious home movie type- and you have a project you want pro editing for- DO NOT BUY FC STUDIO as it will not handle 12 bit sound at all!!!!!! Why would apple do that? It seems criminally obvious to me that they want lots of useless ""prosumer"" sales.... apple made less of a friend with me... I bailed to use the free programs that handle 12 bit without a blink- too bad I had ambition for our Tibetan children's films... its my mistake for filming in 12 bit sound... theirs for not clearly stating that the product does not support the most common format... it does not upset me though... as i always enjoy my revenge ice cold :-)"
3,Seems to be sized for a man,"I like the way this pack unzips like a suit case on the inner portion, it would be nice if the outer portion did the same. The small pocket on the outer bottom is convenient for easy access, but my size 8 ladies merrels wouldn't both fit in the compartment. I adjusted the shoulder straps to the small & xs position but it never felt very comfortable for my 5'4"" frame. The bottom of the pack pushed into my butt. Also, the strap across the chest pushed my boobs down, it needs to be higher for me (or perhaps any woman). It just seems built for a man. It was too big for my two week asia trip, I filled it, and it got pretty heavy. Nothing broke, thank goodness. The zippers are annoying because they are hidden behind a fabric fold, making them hard to straighten & zip. Again, at least they didn't break. Good quality fabric. I did like the way you can completely stow the shoulder & waist straps for air travel bag check."
3,Great design on everything but the zippers,"I like the way these bags are designed, with the side entry making it very easy to access your items, but the zippers are cheap. My husband and I purchased 2 of these packs for our recent trip to Europe and on both bags, the zippers failed. If they would put heavy grade zippers on this product, I would give it 5 stars."
3,Good but with drawbacks,"I just received this pack, it is of good quality and the features are good for its price. BUT BE WARNED that the zippers are pretty much unlockable- the zipper tags are material, so anyone with scissors could cut off the locks attached to them, and there are no lock housings or such, this renders this bag useless for my needs, i'm not sure what to do with it now."
4,Really good but not GREAT,"The brutally fast hardcore drumming on the the punk tracks is less refined than on ""I Against I,"" but the bass is good and Dr Know is a great guitarist when he slows down a bit...but HR's VOICE! Agggh! It's unnervingly shrill and whiney (sounds like Cartman from South Park), and the only time it isn't really abrasive and counter-productive (in lyrical delivery and as hardcore vocals) is on ""Riot Squad"" and ""I."" But the reggae numbers are excellent, and the band's intelligence is on constant display in the album. BTW, can anyone recommend similar artists -- not necessarily hardcore/reggae but just punk/reggae? The blend is a good one."
2,"Hit and miss, mostly miss.","Acknowledging Bad Brains as the fountainhead of hardcore is simple. Deciding which albums of theirs made them who they are is quite another. This is one to let pass by. All the songs are there but the production is horrible (Rick O'Caisek from the Cars???). Go but The Youth Are Getting Restless or their self titled debut, but save your money on this one."
3,Invented Hardcore??I think not,"Bad brains did not invent hardcore,that is a Politically-correct inspired myth.hardcore began in California with bands like The germs,FEAR,Black Flag and others who started to play punk in a harder and faster style then the ramones or sex pistols.The first band to really take it up a notch and play in that jaw-dropping ultrafast style was a band called the Middle class,whose first single 'out of vogue'came out in 1978,more then two years before 'pay to cum'.as an old school punk I can assure you this Bad brains- created- hardcore crap didnt begin till the early 90s,and is more then likely influenced by the color of their skin then anything else.anyway I against I is far better then rock for light,so get that CD instead.Bnadso"
5,AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF YOUR HARDCORE COLLECTION...,"This is a great album, but get the PVC Records release which is available on CD, the reason being that the Caroline re-issue has been sped up making HR sound like a chipmunk and the bass guitar and floor tom seem non-existent. I don't know what the reviewer down below is thinking--with Rock for Light you get blazing furious hardcore assault with some reggae tunes where the extremely overhyped I Against I doesn't come close...If you like 80's rock mixed with hardcore than get I Against I...If your full of testosterone and you just wanna go nuts, then get Rock For Light!!!!!!!"
1,"Beware - not the ""original"" beer nuts",Very disappointed. Did not know these were not the peanuts with the red skins. How can they be beer nuts - without the skins?????
5,Carhartt Artic Coat,"I had to give this product the highest score possible. Carhartt is probably the best work clothing available. I do have issues with them, but it has nothing to do with their warmth or fit. It has to do with their advertising across the front of the product, a label about 1 and a half inch square. It is easy to remove, but would be better if it wasn't there."
4,nice but...,"Keeps me warm--even on chopper rides here in Afghanistan, but I should have gotten the tan on--it shows all the dust."
1,Terrible Product all around. . .,"This mixer should be renamed to Black & Decker jet engine. On the lowest speed, it is as fast as any normal mixer. Settings 2-5 (as well as the extremely useless ""power boost"") are worthless. Save yourself the time and trouble and buy one that has a full range of useable speeds. As far as build quality, it does have decent construction. That doesn't make it useable, though."
1,Too Much Speed,"I took the mixer out of the box, inserted the beaters and turned it on just to try it out. I was shocked at the ""lowest"" speed. It was like the highest speed on my old mixer. Upon first use I learned was right. I placed the beaters in the bowl to cream butter/sugar. I had butter flying all over the kitchen. Then I tried adding the dry ingredients. Flourstorm!! I had to mix it in by hand until it was wet before I could use the mixer again. I wondered if, at that speed, I was completely overworking the flour and my banana bread would be too tough. Definitely returning. I imagine it would be great for the hard to mix things like doughs, but there's no useable low speed."
1,Useless,Worst mixer I have ever used. It spatters everything everywhere. I tried to whip cream with it today and ended up with cream all over me and the walls. Complete waste of money.
1,Useless Junk,"If you want to use the dough hooks that are shown with the product, then Do not buy this product!!! I was interested in this product after seeing the dough hook attachments in a local Walmart. What was delivered had such flimsy beaters that they were damaged by bread dough!!! The product was advertised to have special bread dough attachments that are not part of what is delivered. I spent over an hour to find the attachments that were advertised to be part of the product. Buyer Beware!!!"
1,Designed by Tim the Toolman Taylor,"This item is severely overpowered. I thought at first that I had bought a lemon, but I see from other reviews that it was designed this way. The lowest speed is way too fast, and it has a Turbo button. Use it for a bass fishing motor--it can't be used for mixing."
4,Get Your Drone,"""Flux + Mutability"" is the second of two companion albums, that would be the only output by these artists under the banner of Sylvian/Czukay. ""F+M"" picks up where ""P&P;"" left off by continuing an ongoing experiment in dubbing, ambient-drone stylings and civil tape implementations.Flux is perhaps this duo's most accessible piece, as it is their only piece to contain something of a rhythm section. Throughout the piece ambient guitar drones are punctuated by various guitar riffs and flughorne meanderings, all to a soundtrack of personal recordings made by Czukay.Mutability differs from Flux more than Premonition did for Plight as Mutability simply stated, is a series of guitar drones in a styling reminiscent of whale soundtracks. I have a hard time seeing where on this track Czukay contributed, but the listening experience is enjoyable all the same.Best Quote (From Previous Reviews):""a gently susurrating helix of sounds"" [B. J. C. White]"
3,"Great Pillow, horrible pump","This makes a really nice pillow, and packs up pretty small, however it does not work as a pump for therm-a-rest mats which makes it half way worthless"
5,Excellent Pictures,"FIrst book I read on Wright Brothers. Excellent pictures and good bood. Wish I could get some of these pictures in 5x7 glossy for the walls in my house, even ""first flight"". After reading the book, I went back looking at the pictures several times."
4,"Good product, not perfect, but good","I don't get all the complaints about this mouse. I have one and I game with it a lot. I agree that the button placement is less than ideal, but it's not an impediment. That's about the only gripe I can find with it.I like that I can magnify things on the desktop, it makes low-contrast webpages easy to read, and I like that you can assign functions to every button based on what application you are running. For instance, I assign the ""gaming toggle"" to the pinky button, which allows me to set whatever tracking speed reduction I choose to toggle on/off with that button. Perfect when looking through a sniper scope.There are definitely going to be better ""serious gaming"" mice out there, but for ~$30-40, I haven't seen one."
4,Good MOuse,"Great Mouse, Best mouse for long CAD or 3D development. NO batteries required or lost RF signals jump across the screen. Great Precision Buying more!Be sure to customize mouse settings via control panel for maximum enjoyment"
3,not bad,when it was working it was fine... the two buttons on the sides that are customizable were kinda fun but often got in the way. It started giving me skipping trouble about 3 months ago and now has completely lost connectivity with the USB port. I just got another mouse and it works great so it was the mouse not my laptop. Was good when I first bought it about 1.5 years ago... now it has totally died.
1,Terrible. Go for the MS Comfort Mouse 3000 instead,"Terrible ergonomics ... thumb button that's too far forward, and a ""pinky"" button (or thumb for a leftie) that is unusable. NO tilt-scrolling! That's right, no 4-way scroll wheel. It has the same shape as the Comfort Mouse 3000, which I like ... so for $20 or more less, get the Comfort Mouse 3000.Microsoft missed the mark with this loser. Don't even bother with it. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would - simply because Microsoft offers better wired mouses for less, and better wireless mouses for the same price."
2,Not as good as you'd expect from Microsoft.,"I have diabetic vision problems and thought the Laser 6000's capacity to magnify small areas of the screen would be useful for maps, data sheets, etc. I've decided to return it and get a larger monitor instead. This mouse moves eccentricly and you move over the page or screen in fits and starts. Once you turn the magnifying function on, it can be quite difficult to turn it back off. In one case I had to reboot. Lastly, it screws up some other functions like delete and highlight. It's a great concept and I'll try subsequent versions when they come out but this one ain't ready for prime time."
1,"WOW, what a lemon!","It's amazing how one product can totally turn away a die-hard Apple fan, and this is the product. Before this, I had been a loyal Apple buyer since 1998, but no more. The first one I got had battery problems from the get-go, so I had it exchanged after about 6 weeks. After about 5 months, the exchanged unit started having the same problem. I went to request service, but Apple would not support it and insisted on charging me $30 for shipping back to Apple to repair. As this was still under warranty, I balked at the idea for having to pay to ship back an obviously defective product, so I requested a return/refund. No one at Apple or Mac Mall, whom I had purchased the unit from, would assist me, shuffling me back and forth without resolution. Today I finally got my fill and challenged the purchase w/my credit card company (American Express). I'm getting my money back, and I'll never buy anything from Apple again!"
3,IPOD MINI,"Great product once the files are loaded. We had problem getting the music files to download to the ipod The online help and tiny manual that came with the ipod did not cover our particular problem, and we could not find a phone # for help anywhere.Ended up reinstalling the software several times and finally it worked."
5,MAZIN',I have had the Ipod for a for about a month now and I cannot stop listening to it! The sound quality is perfect and it is so small and light. The I-Tunes software is great and easy to use once you get use to it. The software is great for burning CD's and can also be used to play CD's. The software also has its own music store which gives you a free song each week. I would reccomend this to any one who is looking to buy an MP3 player.
2,It's a standard mp3 player that costs too much,"this iPod craze is stupid. the ipod is no better in any way than any other mp3 player.I borrowed one from a friend for a week, this ""intuitive scroll wheel"" sucks big time. what were they thinking, it takes forever to get anything done with it. Do yourself a favor, don't be Steve Job's love monkey, check out the other mp3 players for half the price."
2,Great Fun till it Breaks,"IPod mini is the must have gadget of the 21st century. Apple really has no competition because there's no other player that's as good. Sound quality is excellent and the size is compact. Completely intuitive interface. iTunes is a great music software and the mini's screen is beautiful, but all that is defeated by the fact that the quality isn't great. The mini has a major defect in it's click wheel, it breaks. I'm a adult user who uses it about 1/2 hour a day when I walk my dog and it didn't last a year. That's a short time considering I paid hundreds of dollar for the item. Almost every ipod owner I know had issues after about a year and the repair service is almost non existent. The ipod is great if your rich enough to buy a new one every year but for someone thinking that this will be the last player they buy for awhile is mistaken."
1,Works great for a few months,"My iPod mini worked great for the first few months, then the battery started having problems. The battery only lasted for a few hours, then 10 or 15 minutes at most. Also, the screen cracked when not even touched! When i went to get it fixed or replaced, Apple said they don't fix screens, and the warrenty doesn't cover accidents! Overall, i was very dissapointed with this iPod and with apple."
1,Buy Your i-Pod Somewhere Else,"While the i-Pod mini is a great product, Amazon is a terrible place to buy it. They subcontract with little known etailer Wholesalersclub.com, who is insufferably slow and unreliable. Although Amazon advertises shipment within 24 hours and Wholesalersclub.com only sells i-Pods and minis, they hadn't shipped my mini after more than 10 days - and continued to stretch out the potential delivery date. They are woefully undersupplied or understaffed or simply incompetent - whatever the problem, it means that you will not get a mini ordered from Amazon any time soon."
4,Overall B+ Rating,Problem with original unit locking up which created a minor hassle. Replacement unit works fine so far.Friendly seller and Amazon Customer Service rep. Fast shipping and overnight replacement service was appreciated.
2,mind of its own,I have had to replace my iPod mini three times?! I have not so much as dropped it. Sometimes the battery appears to be fully charged but the iPod will cease playing in the middle of a workout. Sometimes the display light will come on by itself in the middle of the night?! Plugging the iPod in will sometimes rectify the problem... sometimes not. I've been told it is a battery issue. In addition to the iPod being possessed I've found that I have too much music to store on this little guy. Perhaps its larger brethren are more hearty.
4,Great sound...need more in depth instructions!,"I bought this I-Pod mini a few weeks ago. I cannot believe the sound this little machine generates. It's fantastic. Very light weight. I only have two issues with it. It doesnt come with any real directions so I've had to ask my nephew for help or just figure things out for myself. Also the battery life is not good. I believe it says in the description that it can be used for up to 18 hours of play. I haven't experienced anything like that at all. I'm charging with my computer so I need to find out from apple if that's why my palyback time isn't good. And then of course, I'll have to buy the dock! Oh Well!"
2,iPod Earphones,"The one disappointment I have with this product is that the earphones have already started to come apart. This product is being used by someone who is generally very careful about caring for her things, so I can't even blame it on her! Replacement earphones cost approximately $39--a very high price for something that was not manufactured to last very long."
3,apple ipod,"The ipod was great, but the charger was missing and I haven't been able to get amazon or the apple co. to take resposibilty and ship me the charger. This is the second one I purchase and the first one was complete."
5,The latest news about the iPod line-up,"**** LATEST update to iPod family ****- iPod & iPod photo lines merged; no more iPod photo 30 GB- iPod comes in two capacities - 20 GB ($299), 60 GB ($399) with color screen & photo support- U2 iPod (20 GB) down to $329 from $349 - with color screen & photo support- iPod shuffle 1 GB down to $129 from $149- iPod 60 GB down to $399 from $449- new version of iTunes (4.9) that support podcasts***************************************"
2,Stopped working after 2 days,"The only songs I put on the IPOD were from retail CDs. I didn't download anything from any websites, yet the IPOD became irrepairable and non restorable. Thank goodness Amazon took it back. Now I am just waiting for my refund."
3,Ipod Mini Bashing!,"I own a Zen Mirco, I'd say the Mini is worse than the Zen. The Zen Micro has way better sound quailty than the Mini. The mini has a cooler controls than the Zen though. I also own an Iriver which I'll say sucks. I love my Zen alot more than my stupid mini. The Zen holds more songs, better sound, and alot smaller and lighter. Itunes sucks! I'd rate the mini as a 3."
5,A must have for everyone,"I think the Ipod mini is great! Who needs more than 1,000 songs? I love mine because it is so easy to use and control. For example downloading music is simple and fast. It is great for everyone because you can put any music you want even if it is oldies or barney. My only complaint is that my new green one only gets 3 hours of battery life and the box said 18! Anyways buy a case for protection!"
3,Mini Ipod Truthful Review No BS,"When i first decided to get an ipod, i was very excited about how they are able to store music. one thing that apple failed to mention is it is impossible to share music with other people unless you have a ripping program that rips your songs from ipod back to PC, which is very inconvienient if the other party doesnt have interent access to download a program. Otherwise, i like how it looks, and the buttons are easy to use. I wish it could be better. A LOT BETTER. I recommend the NEW SONY WALKMAN, or DELL DJ, i think they even include an FM radio also."
2,Battery Lasts ONE Hour,"I have had and enjoyed this ipod mini for about 2 years. EXCEPT: The battery is ridiculous, yet advertised as ""up to 18 hours"". This is a bad joke on the consumer. Apple should add ""for 6-12 months of average usage, then will drop to about one hour"". I have enjoyed this ipod but now have to basically tether it to a power supply. I exercise for 60 minutes on a treadmill and have to recharge it EVERY DAY. If I forget to put it on the charger when I get home it have zero battery life the next day."
2,NO POT OF GOLD AT THIS RAINBOWS' END.,"HMMMM....LET'S SEE. WHY DON'T WE RECORD FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ENTIRE ENCHANTING SCORE TO 'FINIANS' RAINBOW' THAT SATIRICAL 1947 SWIPE AT RACIAL INTOLERANCE AND GREED AND CONSUMERISM. OKAY, SO FAR SO GOOD. NOW, LET'S HIRE A CRACKERJACK CAST OF PERFORMERS TO INTERPRET THIS LIGHT-HEARTED AND DELIGHTFUL SCORE. OH DARN! WE RAN OVER-BUDGET, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HIRE A ORCHESTRA-LET'S NOT WASTE STUDIO TIME-LET'S TINKLE THE ENTIRE SCORE ON A CUPPLA PIANOS.(MAYBE NO ONE WILL NOTICE THAT THIS FIRST COMPLETE RECORDING OF 'FINIANS RAINBOW' SCORE HAS BEEN ROBBED OF ITS' SOUL AND REPLACED BY TINKLE, TINKLE, PLUNK, PLUNK.) THE TWO STAR RATING IS FOR THE PERFORMERS WHO ARE LEFT STRANDED BY PENNY-PINCHING PRODUCERS."
3,"Nice shoe, but they keep putting the wrong size in the box!","I ordered a half size larger than I normally wear and the shoe was gigantic. I returned it to get another pair, this time a half time smaller than what I normally wear (they didn't have my exact size each time, in stock). The shoe was marked a size and half larger than what the box said. Now I know why Amazon can sell them for such a low price. The shoes are in the wrong boxes, so you may not get the size you ordered."
4,Christmas Gift,This was purchased for a child for Christmas so it has not been opened yet but it seems to be everything I thought it would be.
3,Okay but could be better,"I also have a Florida Gators uniform set I am very pleased with. The Ole Miss one, however is lacking something. The white pants are fine but you can't tell what color the striping is. The almost look blue and orange instead of red. The shirt was the biggest disappointment. It's a faded our red instead of a bright fresh looking red. The helmet is fine. Of course it would all have been better if Colonel Reb had been the logo. Other than the faded looking color shirt the suit is fine. Judging by the FL Gators one Franklin does make good looking ones for some teams."
4,Collector's Book of the American Locomotive,"More to do with models than with actual locomotives, the book is not what I expected. Interesting, but not enthralling."
3,"Not really what I expected, but its ok.",This product is not really what I expected. I was at the 2010 Essence Music Festival was hoping this DVD would capture some of the major highlight from the performers. Im a little disappointed in what it delivers but at least its a keepsake from last years event. I would recommend this product for those who want to get a taste of what the actual festival is like.
5,Very Good Lightsaber,"This Lightsaber is fantastic and greatly made. With the long blade and light-up and humming features you can re- create the long duel of Anakin Skywalker vs. Count Dooku. The lightsaber lets you feel like Darth Tyranus. Red blade, lights up, humming features, what more to ask for. Count Dooku is a well known character and is a Sith for quite a while. This lightsaber also went well with my other lightsabers. It will keep you fighting with for a decade. The lightsaber is so well made and quite durable."
5,as you can see my jedi powers are far beyond yours dooku swe2,"i just bought this it is so cool. i love the the ""woosh"" sounds and just the model is great. so i strongly suggest this toy it's flippin' sweet"
1,"Not described well enough, returned...","This is the same piece you can get for half the price... The pricing is high, and the description, though not false, leaves out just enough. Both of these reasons make you think it is the metal version.. it is not. This is the plastic toy. They are sold elsewhere for less than half the price I paid for it. If you are looking for a decent Plastic TOY, then it is worth the $40 to $50... Not $150 like the Force FX version."
1,Broken right out of the box,I ordered this for my son and the light worked but the sound did not work right out of the box. There appears to be something loose rolling around inside of the handle. Toy's R us was perfectly willing to replace or refund the defective toy.
1,WTF!,this thing sucks so friken bad i returnend it because the sound was very low quolity.I sent it back so i could get mace windo's lightsaber his is muce better.
4,Best headphones ever owned,After owning these for approximately five year and having owned several mores expensive and several cheaper models in can honestly say these are the bet I this price range. Of course if you spend hundred more for say top Bose with noise canelling headphones you could do better. But for around $120 these cannot be beat. Base is rich while hi frequencies are crispExtended wearing is not a problem. Most comfortable over the ears headphone I own. Only pair that beats it ib comfort is my bluetooth wrap around the back senseenbrenner.I recommend these Bang and Olufsen Form 2 headphone.
2,Form 2: B&O,"As I expected from B&O, these look the part, they sound the part too. Trouble is they feel like a cheap piece of junk on your head. Two stars for the sound and look. 0 for the comfort level, after 10 minutes I wanted to tear them off and resell them on Amazon. I wouldn't do that to someone else. There's alot of good earphones in the marketplace. Unfortunately, these aren't them."
3,the plight of an audiophile...,"without a doubt these are the best sounding headphones i've ever purchased although i'm greatly disappointed in the durability. i use these headphones at my desk at work and ONLY while sitting and working on the computer. within six months of purchasing them the plastic on the inside of the headphones broke next to the screws that hold the metal ""slides"" in place. i was very impressed with b&o; when i brought them back to the store and they replaced them with no questions asked. but here i am, a year after that incident and my headphones are broken in the same spot and just two minutes ago they snapped completely in half when i was simply putting them on to my head.so my review is mixed: the sound quality, as expected from b&o; is phenomenal, although now that my second pair has broken in the same spot(s) with sedentary movement i'm not sure i'll get these again. it's a shame though, i really loved these headphones..."
5,Great Sound for not so much money,"I've own them for 5 years now, they still sound excellent, very good for listening music at home, but not very recomendable for going out with them (must handle with care). They will improve A LOT the sound out of your mp3 player, cd player and you can enjoy the full potential of a nice home stereo system.My ears do tend to hurt a bit after 2 hours with them, but that's enought time for me. Bass is incredible for the size they have, mid's are perfectly clear and hi tones are crispy, well defined and not ear piercing. Give them a try, you wont regret it. By the way, please excuse my english, I'm not a native speaker."
3,The movie is better,"I saw the film before reading the book. I think I like the film better. The first part of the book is good. The subsequent parts, however, I think are a bit out of control especially the parts when Karen worked as a double agent and when she confronted with Kagan."
2,Tedious,"One of the most boring and unattractive books I have ever read. What an unfortunate idea to give a running commentary on the events rather than let the reader enjoy the events themselves. I often wondered whether I was reading a badly written essay rather than a novel. Instead of a good story about the racial and political complexities of a colonial (and post-colonial) society you get an exercise in style. Self-indulgent sophistication makes this a tedious read. No more Naipaul for me, thankyou."
3,Not off to a very good start,"First of all, the light is about what I expected as far as design quality. The flexible arm would be fine while connected to a relatively stationary laptop, but I bought it to connect to a vehicle mounted computer, which bounces around a bit. Within the first few weeks, I started to notice that the arm was not holding its position as well as when it was brand new. Also, one of the LEDs went out after just a few hours, but the remaining two are more than enough to satisfactorily illuminate my keyboard. The light is bright enough to see the keyboard, but not too bright to be annoying. The most perplexing thing about the purchase was that this light is packaged in a box that is about 4"" x 2"" x 1/2"", but it is shipped in a box so big that it could easily hold 50 of these lights."
2,"great idea, poor executiion","The lights worked well for a week; then one led failed. Now will use this as a two led lamp. Recommend a 5 led set so if one goes, still have 4 to give enough light. Also if anyone is listening, an off/on switch would help."
1,Junk,Out of the box didn't work. Would not have givin it a 1 Star review if there was a zero. Now its time to play the refund game.
5,Great expansion,"This is really refreshing for this game that is great but after a few rounds you start feeling like there are too little destination tickets. Great expansion. Some people praise the change to regular size card deck but I have to say that one of the things that first lure me about the game was the nice little euro-style deck. My eyes, though, really appreciate the regular sized ones."
4,A nice addition to the Train Game,"We love Ticket to Ride, and this expansion set was a great addition. The bigger cards are nice to have and the new destinations throw a twist into the ""same old, same old."" Still, we love the game with or without the new cards."
5,A must-own expansion pack,"If you have, or are thinking about buying Ticket to Ride USA, this is a must! The full-size cards (tickets and train cards) are so much easier to shuffle than the half-size cards that came with the TTR USA game. The graphics are high quality, and the tickets are marked with ""1910"" or ""Big Cities"" to help you play four different options (original TTR USA cards only, 1910 cards only, Big Cities only, or ""Mega"" game in which you use all the destination cards which is good for 4 or 5 players). I store two baggies of trains in each compartment and use the extra compartments to store my 1910 deck in the TTR USA game box."
5,Gagawolala Review on Ticket To Ride 1910 Expansion,"I lost finally...to a group of people I play weekly game to.I like the feeling of losing, you know, winning all the time makes a game no fun anymore. I now know why some players only play certain games with people at their level.This game is classic. I really forgot how the original is played since every time I play, I play the 1910 Expansion. Perhaps there is no as much fighting for the routes and more harmony in the game. But where is the fun if there is not much competition.You with me ?"
3,Given as gift,"This was an item purchased as a gift for one of our sons, and he seems to be pleased with it."
5,A must have for Ticket fans,"If you enjoy Ticket to Ride this expansion pack is a must. It provides some additional routes, and ways to play the game, so that variety is good. But the best thing is the cards are BIG and you can see them easily and handle them easily. The bigger sized cards makes this worth purchasing alone!"
5,A great expansion!,A great expansion with odd routes that add to the difficulty of the game and make things more interesting becomes they are not the same routes that I've been playing for years. The new cards force the players into different areas of the board that were often underutilized.
3,Expensive add-on but rejunvenates the game,"Greatly improves the gameplay because in the original version of TTR whoever builds one of those long, northern routes with 5 and 6 car links always wins the game. The expansion set creates many smaller routes which can be doubled-up with existing routes and it makes it more worthwhile to pickup more destination tickets. Also, the bonus for most routes completed finally breaks the dominance of the long routes (near the Canadian border).On the minus side, I just paid 20 bucks for a pack of cards. Hello???? Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars. Also, there is no way to ""dock"" the expansion set with the original box so now I have two boxes to carry around. Thanks alot WOW.There are three full variants included which require different strategeies."
5,A must have upgrade for Ticket to Ride,"If you own Ticket to Ride USA, this is a must have upgrade.The original cards in Ticket to ride are small and tough to shuffle, this upgrade replaces ALL of those cards, plus it adds new destination cards, Big city Cards, and a new bonus card.Having full size cards makes this great game even better, and more enjoyable to play. I would buy this upgrade even if there were no additions to the game, just the replacment full size deck of cards. You can use a card shuffler with the full sized cards, you can see them easier, it is just so much nicer with the full sized cards.Having all the new destination cards, Big city Cards, and new Bonus card gives you several new ways to play the game if you are beginning to want more variety in your Ticket To Ride games. It is definatley a ""Must have"" upgrade in my opinion!"
1,"All Style, No Substance","This book is shallow and pretentious, the literary equivalent of a wine-and-cheese eater at a Soho gallery who cares more about being seen with the art crowd than exploring art. Caveney is the wine sipper, Burroughs the unfortunate artwork buried beneath Caveney's oh-so avant garde style. Rather than providing insight or information about his fascinating subject, Caveney pastes together a collage of hackneyed Burroughs images, and a few airy snippets of idolatrous prose. I got more pleasure from imagining how exciting a decent biography of Burroughs would be, than from reading this awful book."
3,So-So Book,"The only reason I read this book was because it was in Amazon's under $5 bargain bin. The fact that it is on sale should have been a red flag that it is not that good...However, this book makes a very nice coaster. It prevents my beautiful furniture from getting water stains from the beverages I set on it. This book is less then $5...Would it really hurt you that much to buy it??"
2,Head Sizes-distance btw tiles - return costly,Doesn't fit all tile surfaces as depends upon tile size and distance between tiles. Heads are large for small tile size and if you get head to fit on one tile the second head lands on grout surface and it can't attach. Cost to return was $20 UPS - for a $30 product - I donated it to an elder facility rather than waste any more money. Product description should be very specific re: how to measure for this rail before purchase.
1,Poor product,I could not even get this to stick to the BR tile. Very unsafe for someone unsteady on their feet. This product should help not hinder. SCARY.
1,Not for Heavy weights...,"The suction cups will not hold unless on very clean, or smooth surfaces. Even on smooth surfaces, one should be careful putting too much weight or pull on the handle because the suction cups could loosen from being attached. It happened to me. Luckily the other end was still attached and I regained balance before it got completely detached. Have to throw it away before any untoward accident happens."
4,Good All Around,"Ann's book does a nice job of touching on a full range of emotions and feelings. The book wasn't heavy on specific advice, just all around good ideas that everyone should acknowledge when receiving an inheritance. It is a pretty light read with good examples and stories for anyone reading the book. I purchased copies for other members of my family to help them with our recent situation."
4,Unraveling Famous Myths!,"Quick true-or-false quiz: Johnny Cash served hard time in the slammer; Ulysses S. Grant was last in his West Point class; The phrase 'Under God' has always been part of the Pledge of Allegiance. If you answered false to all three, congratulations! If you didn't, you should pick up a copy of this book to learn the truth about Johhny C. and lots of other history and pop culture myths.In 246 pages, author Brian Thomsen debunks over 60 popular myths ranging from St. Patrick to the Bush Administration. Along the way the reader discovers that the Alamo wasn't necessarily a heroic last stand, that Abner Doubleday didn't invent baseball, that the 'Great Escape' wasn't so great, who Mario Puzo's real-life model for Don Corleone was and so on.Light fare but fun reading."
3,"The Awful Truths: Famous Myths, Hilariously Debunked","Some of it is ""old hat"" facts an educated person should have already known, some of it is ""interesting gossip"", and a small portion is new knowledge. It is a real ""bathroom book"". I have enjoyed it but probably would not give it as a gift."
5,Harrowing account of the evils of nazism.,"This book cannot fail to provoke overwhelming compassion from the reader.Primo,s account of being a victim of some of the worst evils ever inflicted on man will grab you from the first page and not let you put it down.The author speaks in factual detail of the wickedness inflicted upon himself and the thousands like him during his incarceration in Auschwitz.Another perspective is also written about, The demise of the human spirit and personality when faced with such gross evils. This book should be read by everyone, everywhere and never forgotten."
3,Classic Goth Sound,"For those unfamiliar with the band, Star Industry plays classic goth music in the vein of Sisters of Mercy, particularly the catchier, upbeat material from 'vision thing'. The similarity is especially strong in the vocal department. This newest album (their third I think) is enjoyable, though the songs take awhile to distinguish themselves from one another and run together if you're not paying attention. Thus, they fit the mold nicely but certainly don't break it. Perfect if you want a shot of Sisters-fueled nostalgia, but probably not one to play nonstop for days on end"
4,SPARKLE PLENTY!,"Yes, this book is a beautiful book! How can it not be with such magnificent jewels to show? I liked the way in which Prince Michael grouped the pieces by reigns. It makes it easier to follow in this manner.The quality of the photographs is better than in most jewelry books - except for the ones on the British royals.My one disatisfaction with the work is that it did not include jewels owened by other Romanoffs. It would be great if some author compiled the history of the beautiful pieces owned by other members of that dynasty which survived the revolution and are now in other royal and private collections. The saga of jewels smuggled out during the Bolshevik years and their journey through Europe and America would be very interesting and exciting reading ."
4,"If you are really into jewelry, buy Bulgari (a book)","I have not read the texts yet. but one of the readers comment is correct. The author is not a jewelry expert.I am not particularly interested in the history. If you are like me, just want to see their jewelry, then Bulgari is a better book."
5,"Ahh , The Romanov Jewels","Wow,upon receiving this book, i couldn't put it down! Each page has beautifully photoed pics of endless diadems and emeralds! In fact, i got so worked up with the pictures that i didn't bother to read most of the small intros for each piece of jewelry. I would have to say, my most favorite part of the Romanov dynasty is Nicky and Alexandra ! Alexandra and her mother in law (DAGMAR, the dowager Empress Maria Alexandrovna) have the most stunning jewels i can imagine! Each picture has a small bio of where the jewels are or whether they survived the revolution as most of them have disappeared which puts me in a bad mood. But being on the positive side! I would recommend this to anybody who is in-love with the stunning mountains of jewelry the Romanovs once owned which of course would out do any other dynasty including the British empire.This book is wonderful and addictive . LOLVery Special thanks to Prince Michael of Greece who made this book come alive!"
4,Nice Finish,"I have tried several other brands of caps. Stickers came off, finish was junk or they just did not fit properly. These caps are well made. Finish is bright and sturdy."
3,Good Overview of Persuation,"James Borg offers an overview of the art of persuasion in this good book. The book offers a good balance of important ideas and straightforward presentation.In a more general sense, this book serves as a good starting point for more thorough reading on topics addressed in this book.I recommend this as a primer for those interested in the art of persuasion. It should serve as a good reference base for learning about this important topic."
3,3 out of 5,"This was a good old skool thriller, kinda predictable but good, a young Matt Dillon still looks the same. I would watch it again, good ironic ending. Greed is not GOOD!"
3,YOUNG AND FOOLISH,"Sean Young is the main reason this adaptation of the classic novel and 1956 film doesn't come up to snuff. She's a lovely lady, but her performance in this one is so uninspired and apathetic, one cannot feel for her or cheer her on in her quest to find out who murdered her twin sister. The audience knows early on that Matt Dillon is the nasty culprit, a true sociopath who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. A contrived and convoluted script doesn't help either. For instance, after Young finds out who her husband really is, what makes her sure that he killed her sister? And how does Dillon know that Young is at his mother's house? The supporting cast gamely tries, even Diane Ladd as Dillon's mother, and James Russo as a cop turned security guard. But it's all laid out so methodically lame, it just doesn't work out. By the time Dillon gets his just desert, who really cares?"
3,A great thriller.,"This movie is a great thriller, in the style of Fatal Atracttion and Single, White, Female. But, it could be a little more like Ira Levin's novel. But Sean Young's death ( In the beggining ) is one of the bests in the genre."
2,"INTERESTING THRILLER, BUT.............!","I had seen this film many years ago and saw it was coming on one of my HD channel, so I thought I would give it another look. I like Matt Dillon and he does an adequate job in this so-so thriller. The story is interesting enough, but too many plot holes, a quick resolution and mediocre acting do this one in. It's not a bad watch, if you have nothing else to do though."
4,A good suspence story.,"I don't really see, what some people have against this movie. So what, that they deviated a bit from Ira Levin. It makes the movie nicely compact. Longer and the suspence would go away. Now it's just the right length. Kiss before Dying has a good plot with a nice build-up of the tension and it is well played by the cast. Particularly Matt Dillon as the muderer. I cann't remember a movie where I was more relieved when the villain finally got his come-upance."
4,If only...,If only they have maximized each cd to its fullest time of 80 minutes then this is well worth it. All cds are just in the 60 min. range. The booklet is excellent like a day to day journal or documentation of KC's history. Starless was cut short missing the explosive part. I bought this because my essential KC albums from In the court to Construction were all in the Philippines. The remastering is an A+ but the only downer is the length of each cd. Nevertheless a good accompaniment to the album collection.
3,Too technical to rock... too rock to ecstasy,"Les oeuvres du Père Fripp ne sont :- nécessaires que si elles sont chantées par Greg Lake- audibles que si John Wetton est à la basse- crédibles qu'avec un trio (Bruford-Wetton & Fripp)Pour le reste, écoutez ""Red"" et ""Lark's tongue in aspic""..."
4,Fun toy!,"When my son first received this at 8 months, he was a little scared of it when it would move. He quickly got over that though. He likes to take all 4 rattle shapes out and play with them. He's 9 months now and still won't make it roll across the floor (he knows how and is fine if we do it) but I'm sure when he gets older he will like that part of it.I took a star away because it doesn't shut off without taking the batteries out and it is a pain to have to pull out a screwdriver every time I want to turn it off. The only other thing I don't like is that the wheels will keep spinning even when it runs into something. But when my son is older, that will probably be something he likes. Right now, he loves to spin the wheels manually and gets upset when the rubber on the big wheels spins against his fingers.All-in-all though, he enjoys this toy and probably will for some time."
1,too basic,This book is definitely for the beginner; it's too basic and doesn't include enough detail. Also lacks organization.
2,Great Shoes For Travel and Business,"These shoes are comfortable and well-made. The leather is soft but durable, and you will not have to worry about setting off any airport or courthouse alarms as they do not have a metal shank. They are elegant and stylish enough you can wear with just about any suit, but not feel as though you are wearing uncomfortable, stiff dress shoes. They are quiet, don't squeak on floors or make clicking sounds, and they have good traction. The shoes have maintained their shape well these past four months I've worn them, about two to three times a week, without creasing over the toes. A bit pricey compared to other shoes, but you get your money's worth.Update: After a few more months use, the upper area of shoes above the toes began to pop out, perhaps due to not having any metal support. So while still good for travel, I would not use them day-to-day."
2,A book based on Hubbard's psychological dogma,"This book contains several methods of self-administered psychotherapy invented by pulp fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. Some of the methods may assist some people, however Hubbard pretends to know what ails the human race and rants about that in most chapters of this book. Hubbard fails to grasp that people are individuals with individual issues and using this or that method will ""fix"" everybody up has never proved itself in reality.If I had to choose between doing the exercises in this book and joining the scientology cult, I would choose this book. But, the more sensible people will avoid doing either."
1,Junk Junk Junk!,I got these and like some of the other reviews thought it was really nice and soft. After only a couple of weeks on the bed the bottom of the bed sheet has gotten all frayed and torn. It now looks like cheese cloth on the bottom. I got what I paid for......something cheap.
5,a steal,"I like the pattern. It has a calming effect. Also, the material is 100% cotton which makes it soft and breathable. The color does fade a little after a few washes but it doesn't form fur balls or shed off upon contact. The fitted sheet can accommodate a thick mattress. It was only $5.99 for a set so I bought six. I'm glad I did because I haven't seen any deals like it thereafter."
2,Good one for this price,I bought three of them few months ago. This ia not a very good quality flannel sheet but for the price this Ok to buy.
2,flannel sheets,these were disappointing.. the corner on the fitted cheets tore after the first washing and the flannel pilled up into alot of rough little balls.. i wouldnt buy these again
2,"Pike Street Flannel King Sheet Set, Snowflake Squares",The Prodcut is not good. At the first place the item was not clean and after a sigle wash it even worst. I am not using it any more and will not recommend to other for buying even if you get for good deal.
3,Fuzz and More Fuss,"Pretty on one side sheets are adequate for someone looking at a CHEAP flannel sheet set. At such a great price who can complain about the fact they will overload your dryer lint trap with fuzz, (no exageration, check it halfway thru drying to avoid fire hazard).Despite this and their fabric pilling, I still appreciate I was finally able to get flannel on my bed in the winter so for the price I am happy."
2,Same as everyone else,I didn't wash mine before using them. I didn't have problems with the dye on us using them but I was disappointed with how thin they are. They are already ripping at the corners. I am afraid to wash them from what everyone is saying. They might totally fall apart. I really like the feel of them. They are comfortable to use. But I won't buy anymore just for the fact they won't last long.
1,Don't waist your money on this,"I bought 2 sets, one for me , one as a Xmas gift. I washed mine and it couldn;t fit in a queen bed again. I washed in cold water and dry in low, and it is so small that it could fit a twin bed, but this doesn't finish here. It faded, shred and has pilling everywhere. Please, keep your money and don't buy this set.I sent it back to Amazon, both sets, im still waiting for the refund."
4,Nice.,"Sheet set is nice and comfortable. I like the woodland print. They pile a bit when washed as mentioned, but that is usual. They are a bit thiner than pricey sheets, but softer than many other cheap sets around."
5,a deal at $5.99,"Bought on sale - very pretty. Soft, comfortable, fits well, did not shrink when washed."
3,okay for the price,The sheets are pretty nice. They tend to shrink alot everytime I wash them. For the price they are good enough. I like them but don't love them. The pattern is really pretty. The material is soft.
2,Pike Street Flannel Sheet Set,"Fast delivery. Sheets were wonderful, until I washed them. After washing them they were no longer soft. Rough to the feel. Will not purchase this item again."
4,Flannel Sheets,I just love these flannel sheets. The more they are washed the softer they become. I would recommend these for those cold winter nights.
1,Very Very Poor Quality,"Amazon should give options for 0 star too.I bought these sheets expecting it not to be very good, but atleaset little useable. But this is far away from my expectation. The sheets look horrible (very poor in quality) and once you wash it you will not like to put it again on your bed, as there will be small threads will get into shape of balls.The worst part is that I bough 2 sets. Now I cannot even return it as the return shipping charges are almost $15 for both. I am repenting now, with that money i would have bough one good bed sheet. So dont waste your money here look somewhere else."
1,Worthless,"I bought the red king sized sheets for $15, which I thought was a good deal. It was not. They are still linty after 5 washings, they pill badly, and every time I wash them they get thinner and thinner--I think they are going to disolve compltely at about 7 washings.When we did try to use them on the bed, dh would wake up every morning with sinus problems due to breathing all the lint. When you sit on the bed you see a cloud of red lint come flying up. I can't believe that Amazon even sells a product like this."
1,I didn't know you could make flannel this thin...,"This is truly the thinnest flannel I have ever seen. The fabric tears at the slightest stress, and after two weeks it is pilling. If you want soft sheets these are the sheets for you, just realize that they are truly only to be used as disposable as they are too thin to use as rags and too fragile to wash more than once. Even my rags are thicker than these sheets were new! You truly do get what you pay for!"
2,Gud for the price not gud enough!,Its warm and cozy...but really looks dull after wash! But it didn't lint so much as written here but looked way less attractive after the first wash. Though i don't recommend this...its ok to have an extra sheet set if its available in a low price as 9 or 10 bucks!
3,Warm and Cozy,Very reasonable price of $5.99 each. I purchased two sets. One set was to be a gift but not now. The sheets are cozy but the top sheet seems thin. One set had to be altered because there were five small holes about 2 inches down from the heam on the top sheet. I give only a 3 because the quailty is O.K and the price very reasonable.
4,Sheets,They are pretty nice sheets for the price. They are a little thin compared to other flannel sheets I own but they are supper soft and have made it nice to crawl into bed. For the price it was a GREAT Deal!
3,fine sheet set,"These sheets overall are good. They fit the larger, deeper mattresses just fine. They are soft and warm. The only negative comment is that they are not very thick, like the sets I have purchased at Target."
1,Poor quality,After only 1 wash these sheets were stringing and coming apart at the edges. They also are not very soft!
4,Cozy sheets for Michigan winters,"I've always thought flannel sheets would be a good investment for Michigan winters. Price usually held me back. The price at Amazon made it worth taking a chance. So far, GOOD DEAL! Nice and cozy. Cold water, delicate cycle wash, Lowest cycle dry, Wrinkles, very little, Hey, I'm a guy! Wrinkles! For the price, it's nice!"
5,Great sheets for a great price!,"I love these sheets. They are so soft and cozy. And with the price I paid, you can't beat it. I'd definitely recommend them!"
1,Its Not SOFT .. Its not so good .. I returned it,"By reading all those reviews i too ordered it .. But it looks very much as a used product, ""In the Woods"" had lots of rusty stains on it ..I had to return it.."
3,OK for the price,"Considering the price, these sheets are acceptable. Not the best flannel sheets I've had, but you get what you pay for. After being washed, they leave a lot of little fuzz balls."
2,Watch the sizing,"Purchased this and another set of pink flannels for a queen-size bed. Both sets were labeled for queen, by the way. The pink set fit great, felt great. The floral scroll would not fit my queen bed without a huge struggle, then popped off the corners the minute I got into bed. Ended up giving them to my fiance for his double bed in the UK, and they fit his bed perfectly. Also, the fabric of the floral scroll sheets was scratchy and not warm and fuzzy, even after several washings. The price was super cheap, but I still wouldn't buy again if given the chance."
4,Flannel is Better,"This is my first set of flannel sheets, and I am so glad that I bought them. I don't have to go to bed with socks anymore! The only drawback that I have found, is that they generally fill up the lint filter when I dry them. I would buy them again though."
1,Love Christine...hated this album,"Has none of the passion and vocal quality of her performance in Grey Gardens. And Billy Strich didn't help. Poor choice of songs, arrangements, etc. Listened to it once."
5,"""timo livro","Realmente adorei o livro. Tem todas as melhores verses de Siloti, que sempre ouvi em CDs e nunca pude estudar. O papel é da melhor qualidade, as impresses e distribuio das partituras so muito boas também.Gosto das verses de Siloti, acho simples de executar, rápidas de aprender, sem que se perca a qualidade musical da obra original.A parte inicial apresenta ainda interessantes dados biográficos e belas fotos."
1,The Alexander Siloti Collection,"When this package arrived home, a notation was attached by the Japanese post office saying that the package had been wet so left for certain days to dry it up. Luckily, no permenance in the book. Also the front page was folded down at the right upper place. I regret having to say a bit rough shipment.Kiichiro MUROOKA"
2,"Easy to read, but hard to believe","In the begining, the historical information was interesting and quite believable, but by the end accuracy and credibility were suspect. Perhaps an update to include studies released since the book's publication (i.e. the 2006 Surgeon General's Report on Secondhand Smoke) would correct the book's biased slant towards tobacco."
5,Best narrative ever on Tobacco history,This was a great book that I couln't stop reading. It has all the facts and anecdotes about Tobacco around the world. Every page is full with them.
2,Underwhelming,"I checked out the book recently, thinking that it would be an interesting topic. I became a little wary when the author claimed that no European had any frame of reference for the act of smoking in 1492. It's possible, but it seemed unlikely to me. People in the Middle East and Asia would have experience with smoking opium and cannabis, unless I'm mistaken. I don't know if it was present in Europe at the time, but these were explorers who presumably had some knowledge of Asia. I was also less than thrilled to hear the author's assertion that athletes die earlier than sedentary individuals because their hearts beat so much faster (he goes on to explain that the human heart has only so many beats). The author is very enthusiastic about smoking, and it perhaps colors his writing on secondhand smoke. He spends a great deal of time explaining why he thinks that secondhand smoke has no discernible health effects.To sum up, I think it's a poorly written book on an interesting topic."
2,One Minute to Zero,"Movie had a great story, but filming methods of that time was not that great. I enjoyed the movie mostly because I had met the stars when they were in Colorado Springs during the filming of some of the movie.I purchased this movie from Amazon."
4,Old Fashioned war movie with surprises,"One Minute to Zero has been one of my favorites always. This story covers the earliest days of the Korean War until the breakout from Pusan and the landings at Inchon (only referred too). For me what makes this story so good is the reality given to each of the main characters. Real people in real situations. The producers courage to show an attack against civilian refugees being used to infiltrate our lines by the North Koreans to kill our soldiers was so totally out of line with the usual white wash given to any subject which would make our troops look bad. Howard Hughes stood his ground to the DOD and left it in to show the horror of war but also how because of war, good men must make terrible decisions that kill the innocent along with the enemy in order to save their mens lives. As Robert Mitchum's character pointed out ""Decisions that should be left alone to God"". A pulsating and action packed but thoughtful picture."
4,One Minute To Zero,I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to war movie fans. It is a classic war film set in the Korean War.
3,One Minute to Zero,Disappointed in the movie. Remembered it a bit differently. Ann Blyth and Robert Mitchen not up to their usual standards.
4,Good Blanket,I used this blanket on a trip to Hawaii and it was very comfortable. The only con is that I wish it was jsut a little bit larger. I still would recommend it to friends.
5,Nice blanket for frequent travelers or for camping!,"If you need a blanket for those long flights or for camping out in the woods, I would recommend this one. It is quite compact and warm. Samsonite brand means that you are getting a quality product. Highly Recommended!"
3,Can't get it.,"It looked good, but was unavailable. It sat on my Wish List for a few years and I gave up."
4,Fits the 6133,I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. It seems to fit his 6133 just fine.
3,Not too bad,"Mrazek has written a fairly entertaining book but it lacks a soul. It seems to be written for kids and not for adults - the plot is thin, the romance, the romance of children and the historical facts glossed over. On the cover of this book, DeMille compares it to ""Cold Mountain"". Goodness, it is nowhere the fine book Frazier wrote.So, not a bad book and an enjoyable but lightweight read."
2,Definitely not a Cold Mountain or Dickensian!,"Historically accurate, but very low-level reading. After Gods and Generals, Killer Angels, and The Last Full Measure, a big disappointment."
1,Surprised by all the positive reviews,"I ordered this based on the rave reviews. Stereotypical characters, plot threads that run off into nothing. . . at best, the novel is for young adults, but it is in no way for adults. I've been reading Howard Bahr's novels of the war, and they are excellent. I live in the area depicted in the novel, so I was doubly disappointed by the book. For example, I doubt the author has ever crossed the New Market gap at Massanutten, based on his descriptions in the novel. His ideas and characters were full of promise, but the book doesn't deliver."
3,a very entertaining quick-read of a Civil War adventure,"I picked up this book because of a quote on the cover that likened it to Cold Mountain, which is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. While I do not believe the comparison is justified, it was very engrossing and I'm not sorry I finished it. The story is exciting and, I believe, would appeal to a wide age-range. The author did a good job with his descriptions of the utter devastation of the land of the Shanandoah Valley. However, the novel pales before the evocative prose of Cold Mountain.The characters were not deeply drawn. Stonewall's Gold is a good story, but not great literature."
4,Well crafted; well written,"The characters and setting are pretty believable. However, I did find that the middle of the book really came to a screeching halt around the time that the female lead shows up. But it is eventually over with, and the story moves on briskly.But the whole ""is the book real, or fiction!"" aspect really got annoying. I would still recommend it, though."
4,Pretty good story,"I started reading this novel to compare it with mine, ""Chase The Wild Pigeons."" They both have teenagers as the main characters. This story is great. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give anything away. It moves along nicely, and the relationship with the main characters is nice and believable. It takes place in the Shenandoah Valley--I've been there to research my own novel, so I could see it in my mind's eye.If you want to read a Civil War novel where the war is the background, get this. It is well worth the time. Also, be sure you read the postscript."
3,Entertaining for parents and children,"Set in the Shennandoah Valley in the final winter of the war, this novel plays both necessary storytelling chords: plausible mystery/adventure and accurracy in historical setting/period detail. The characters are believable within their contexts and take actions commensurate with their abilities. A reader may quibble with the young adult's adventures but their motivations are made clear and their journey is in the realm of the possible. I initially avoided this novel because of the title and Jackson does not, as I recollect, make any appearance in the book, though one of his Valley battles do. The front cover blurb about Cold Mountain is undeserved; I dismissed the comment when I saw the name of the who author made the comparison. But when McPherson and Krick gave it a nod, I bought it, enjoyed it passed it along to my children as well as my wife."
3,A decent suspense Civil War adventure tale,"I found the novel both intertaining and compelling, since the main character was a teen aged boy caught amid the horrors of war. The story was a bit compressed (perhaps from too much editing), but a good one. The villians were not fleshed out enough, but the follow up characters were first rate. Since I share the same last name as the main character of the band of Confederates, I was curious to find out about his background and fate. I think another one hundred pages would have made this little tale that much better. The setting was good, the details of the weather and terrain was colorful and realistic. Don't expect to read about massive columns of infantry assaulting a fortified ridgeline or rows of thundering artillery. Rather, it is a more personal journey written with a unique style. A good read on a chilly weekend with a good cigar and glass of Burgandy. Check it out."
5,Great Story,I picked this book up because I remembered former Congressman Mrazek's successful efforts to save the Manassas Battlefield from becoming a shopping mall. It was clear he had a deep appreciation for the history of the Civil War and it shines through in this very entertaining book. It's a terrific story -- I couldn't put it down until I finished -- and seems to have the historical and geographical details on the mark. A great book for all ages!
5,A book for all ages,"I had heard great things about this book from members of the Civil War Roundtable. But it is so much more than a Civil War novel. It is about the testing of two young people to the limits of their courage. As such, it would be a valuable and enthralling book for young adults too. I wish there were more than five stars."
2,Good potential but falls short.,"This is an interesting and easy read. The story had potential, but the author erred by adding a female character who does things that a girl of that day and social standing would never have done. Minor historical errors appear here and there, and the author includes some modernisms that detract slightly from the story (like making snow angels)."
1,Considerations,"This book has a lot of valuable information, but this book is not for everyone. The book serves to remind therapists that we are human, but focuses on all the possible negative aspects of a therapists life and practice. I feel this book turns people away from seeking therapy or going into the profession. The book is written with an over-whelming negativity and a hint of arrogance. If you are looking for something to normalize your negative experiences as a therapist, then this is possibly the best book out there for you. If you are romantically involved with a therapist that you are concerned about, then this may be a good thing to read to better understand what may be going on. If you are new to the field, then read the book on and off as needed (if you must). If you are not a therapist or involved with one, then this book has nothing for you. Therapy, like every field, is a mixed bag. This book fails to acknowledge the goodness in the lives of those being a therapist."
3,On being a therapist,I read this for a book review. it was an easy read and for anyone in the field of psychology and counseling it had some insight on how to keep from getting burned out and discouraged. Alot of the stories are of his own experiences so it made it personal. He seemed genuine and wanted to help out others in his field to avoid the mistakes that he had made.
1,Get a job!,"The least this book does is point out the reality that many who falsely pride themselves in the profession of psychotherapy would do better in other career fields: welding, sewing, fruit picking, VCR repair. Seriously, if you fancy yourself a therapist yet the thought of actually getting your hands dirty and dealing with depression repulses you then please snap out of your Hollywood illusions and accept a normal job with the rest of us... before you go and further ruin someone else's life."
3,WoW,"I really liked the cd.. But some of the lyrics shocked me. The group is as good, or if possible, better than 'N SYNC, BSB, and 98 degrees. The fact that they are more rap, hip-hop, than the other groups really sets them apart"
5,FIVE IS COOL!!!!!!,"The first time, I heard their song ""Got The Feelin"" on MTV, it cheered me up and I thought 'Man, I must buy the CD! It was so cool! I like Five because they are cool. They are a Pop and rock group. I like their songs called ""Everybody get up"" and ""Got the feelin."" Not only do I like their songs but I like the guys. They are so cute, I like the way they dance and they have good voices. When you got the feeling you must buy it!!!!!! They should be #1 here!!!"
5,Rippin' up the charts!!,"These guys are chart breakers and money makers!! J and Abs can lyrically flow and with vocals by Scott, Rich, and especially Sean they combined to form a mezmorizing sound. Buy the US CD. Buy the UK CD <with hidden track #55!!> and buy all the singles. Especially ""Got The Feeling"" so you can hear Sweet Sugar J in ""Coming Back For More!!"""
5,"Best CD i've ever heard in my entire life, the best lyrics",This CD has the best type of music. I listen to it all day long and know all the songs. Thanks to Five I now have a CD that I can enjoy.
3,Five is Okay...,"This CD is pretty good, but some of the songs don't make sense, or aren't that good. I would recommend this CD to people that like the Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, or 98*."
5,I LUV THIS CD!,they r soooooooo hot and they sing so good! i luv them i heard them in germany when they first came out and i was hooked! it makes me feel so good when i hear it!! i always play it! i luv if u got the feelin! and i luv all the songs
5,5ive Bad Boys With The Power To Rock You !!!,"I'm from London, and I think 5ive are excellent, especially the songs - When The Lights go out, It's The Things You Do & Switch. I have noticed some differences from my album ( The UK version ) and the US version. The UK one has 6ix extra songs : ""Cold Sweat"", ""Shake"", ""Human"", ""That's What You Told Me"", ""Don't You Want It"" & ""Straight Up Funk"". but the US version has a different song from the UK one : ""When I Remember When"". Also, on the UK version there is a cool song on track 55 called ""Switch"", but I don't know if this is on the US one."
5,It is worth listening to,"Five is a great band, and you should give it a chance, some of the lyrics are a little perverted but it doesn't matter, their not the only band with that, 98 degrees first CD was even worse with perverted lyrics, but not all of Five's songs are bad and if they were, the disney channel wouldn't have done a special on it, and books and posters of them wouldn't be in schoolastic flyers that are handed out in school. Five is the best boy band ever. Anyone who gives them anything less than 5 stars is crazy, and if it's because of some of the lyrics, they should lighten up, and get a life. Because Fife is a great band and so are their songs and their voices, plus they have 1 thing that not all boy bands have.... Talent and they are all cute, especialy SCOTT, SCOTT rules, and so does Five. So ""Everybody Get Up"" and by their CD ""Untill The Time Through"" You will be Satisfied. You will see why most people like them."
1,wannabe's,"These guy's are not only ugly but they sing worse than any of the other boy bands.It seems that all these boys can think of is having sex with about any girl that comes along, not only that, but they take the general themes from other songs and warp them into crud , for example spice girls has a song that goes ""when two become one""they took the same theme and made a song that goes ""when five become one, talk about dumb.Don't waste your money on this crud."
3,They're Alright....,"When I first saw them on their Disney special i was expecting alittle bit more. I'm not saying their bad or anything though. But I still like *Nsync better. The songs have great melodies and stuff but the lyrics on most of the songs are terrible. I have to say the first time I saw Abs I totally fell in love with him but if I had a choice between Abs and Justin from *N Sync, I'd have to say Justin! Don't get me wrong though...I still love Abs. I really like his hair and his eyes are so dreamy! But Justin blue eyes are still cutter. And so is his curlly hair!"
1,Five: The Scum of the Boy Bands,"This music is horrible (if you can call it music). There is only one thing these guys want from girls and it is easy to figure out if you listen to the lyrics at all. The funny thing is how all their songs complain about girls leaving them and they wonder why they cant get a girlfriend. If you like this perverted, idiotic music then you deserve to have wasted your money."
1,"Close your eye, girls","If you want to fall in love on CD or MUSIC, just close your eye and REALLY listen. You may find Steve Wonder is more attractive than them. Of course I am man."
5,great songs from a great band,"A good album with different types of tunes. A fab selection of groovy dance songs and also cool ones to chill out to. When the lights go out is brilliant and everybody get up, just makes me want to dance! A must for any pop fan!"
5,If you were to tell me rate this cd from 1-10 i'll give a 10,"WOW!!!! This is the frist thing i said when i heard FIVE'S cd. These five talented good looking guys have it all with there mixture of POP, R&B, HIP-HOP,AND ROCK. Their sure to be number one this year and years to come. So check them out. SEAN, ABS,J, SCOTT, AND RICH. ( MY FAV IS SEAN)"
4,Interesting debut . . .,"In this CD either the song is a great song that is definately a potential highlight, or it's horrible and shouldn't have been recorded. Thankfully the good songs overpower the bad. When The Lights Go Out is surprisingly sensual for a boy band, but is laced with undeniably catchy funk and hip-hop grooves. Slam Dunk (Da Funk) is even more hip hop flavored and includes rap verses. The hip-hop/funk styled songs are where Five really shines, but of course like most of the other boy bands they felt the need for sugar poppy songs and ballads. Until The Time Is Through and Satisfied are horribly cliched and are hard to listen to. But this is still a very fun album. Picture Backstreet Boys, Usher and Spice Girls meshed into one CD. You'll get the same results. If you collect boy band CDs this one must be in your collection. Hopefully on their next recordings they will stick to more R&B styled songs."
2,An A for effort,"The only reason I gave this band 2 stars is 'cos they did write a lot of the tracks on their cd... I do think that's pretty admirable. A couple of the songs on here are neat, but listening to the rest of the music on their debut album really turned me off. If they could cut out all crap on the CD, such as the sexual etc. etc. then perhaps I would have more respect for them. Personally I prefer music more upbeat and clean- if that's what ya perfer then DO try *Nsync, BSB, or 98 degrees... Not that I'm comparing, but there are better alternatives out there people!"
1,They suck!,"This cd is terrible.I would never buy it.They wanna be like Backstreet,N'SYNC,and 98 degrees.I hate this peice of crap.personally i think they all wanna be like New Kids on the Block,so therefore they all suck."
1,Five what? Definitely not Stars.,These people are awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't buy their CD!!! It'll encourage the to make more and that is what we don't want!!
2,We've heard it again and again. It's time for some change.,"FIVE is what I call an average CD. Since there are so many other boy groups that sound exactly like them, they're no different. Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, Kai.. We've heard them and personally, I'm sick of them. It's the same, sappy lyrics and the melody is like one of those annoying ones which you can't get out of your head."
4,5ive rocks,"Although they're not really that talented, i really luv 5ive's cd. They don't write their own stuff or play any instruments, but then again, neither do bsb, *nsync, or 98 degrees. I guess u'd call em a boy band, but with a harder sound since there's a lot of rapping on most of the trax. So u have an idea of what to expect, these guys were put together by the same agency that formed the spice girls...it's just really fun music. :)"
1,5ive you stand accused of.......,"1. Song cliche #1 : to whit ""moving to the left and shaking to the right"" 2. Song cliche #2 : to whit ""getting up, getting down"" 3. Song cliche #3 : counting in a song, to whit ""7-6-5-4-3-2-1"" 4. Rap cliche #1 : to whit, requesting the audience to ""check it out"" Really gentlemen, need we go on ? These examples are just from one song ! Namely the abysmal ""Everybody Get Up"". You are clearly guilty of plagiarising the ""Bumper Book of Cliched Lyrics"" and therefore I sentence you to ""Death by Spice Girls"". It seems only fitting. May God have mercy on your souls and equal mercy on our ears."
5,"This is a great CD, no one should rate it before they buy it","This is not a boy band, they maybe cute and their song ""When the lights go out"" sounds alittle like a usual boy band, but they're deffinatly not! There CD is fantastic! They have all different types of music, shawn raps in practicly every song! One of my favorite songs on the CD is #10, ""Everybody Get Up"". All in all this CD is recomended."
1,On the music,My review is on the music and i would like to say it stunk and still stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!! Iff i didn't have to put a star i woudn't. signed lost fan...
5,"this band has great rhythm, voices, and looks.","I think that 5ive are the best band in the world and they are all good looking. they have fantastic voices and lyrics. J's a good rapper, Ab's is soooo funny, Rich is sweet, Sean is independent (in a good way), and scott is a good dancer and singer.They rock the world."
4,power pop,"Five's album is the only cheesy top ten pop that i like . It has somehow something about it that makes it less sad than many other albums like it. My favourite song is 'Everybody get up'. And the worst songs are songs 4-8, the slow ones.If you want a laff or want some good party music, five is 4 u. (especially for girls-nice pictures of the boys-umm J)"
5,Words can't describe the..........,"When I fist heard of them I thuoght ""Oh no, not another boy band. Just look at what New Kids on The Block started"". But then I got into it and now am a crazed N Sync, BSB, and Five fan. I recorded their concert on Disney and the tape is now messing up because my VCR was messed up, but I tried to watch it anyways. Pretty stupid,huh. But then if you got that CD and listened, not heard, but listened to it once,you would know why. And I would also like to give a little extra LOVE to Scott out there with his ""three plain burgers, a chocolate shake, a large fries, and eight tomato ketchups"" at McDonalds"
5,this is TALENT,"this album offers a great variety of CATCHY songs. i love it!! you might find yourself singing their songs everywhere you go. i love how they blend in a little of everything: you got a little slow song here, you got some rap over there, you got some r&b, and you got some pop. it is a great mix of music to satisfy your different moods. i encourage you to checkout the album cuz it is so great, your mum will love it!!"
4,"its a good one,i like until the time is through song..",the first song is very good.why...?i like the music and the lyrics.but the album arranging must be check.so near and fulll.but i like the album.
4,One of the best bands around,I think that besides Five being really hot ( say Abs and Scott =) ) they really know how to pump out the party music. Since we have a lot of them we play them a BSB constantly
1,now i now why they called the band 5ive.,"'cause its 5ive guys singing songs that deserve nothing more than a -5 review. OK, all i have to say is that these boys should find a new hobby. Or at least find something better to sing about. I cannot stand the song 'When the Lights go out.' Sure, its catchy, but did anybody listen to the words? C'mon, all these dudes are interested in is something that I'm not going to say online."
4,Pretty good,"This is a good CD, i like the sample clips. I also like them not just because they're trendy but because they seriously are good.They have a nice beat and rhythm. They may be in the category of boy band but they have their own style which makes it cool."
5,It's an awesome cd every song is excellent.,"I love the cd every song is unique. You can't get bored with the cd, like you do with many others. You never get tired of the songs either:)"
1,"Puh-leese, this isn't music. . .","All pop songs sound the same. All pop bands sound the same. This sound is the kind that get stuck in your head and make you want to shoot someone, preferably the artist. If you want music get some rock, but then they aren't as hot as these people right? And then(gasp!) you wouldn't be trendy! I found a way to deal so i'm sure you can."
5,this is the best!,"I am absolutely the BIGGEST Five fan ever i know everything of scott ""spider"" or ""curtains"" robinson! he is so hot the music is like nothing i have ever heard im so glad they are not like bsb nsync or 98* i hate those 3 i only listen to five cuz they are the hottest bestest lad band ever!! i uaed to be really shy and then i heard them and they just inspired me to get up out of the house and go into the world and live alittle i say hi to everyone because they have just made me so incredibly happy = ) I LOVE FIVE 4 LYFE-ALWAYS"
4,Heart Warming Tale- Color Relationships,"The Wedding by Dorothy West was quite interesting. In the beginning I didn't really get the idea of the story. The setting seemed to be in the past and the present, switching back and forth. It also had many characters that I wasn't able to comprehend. There seemed to be many different plots, and not just one main one. I really like the idea how Dorothy West spindled the characters all together. I like how everyone was tied together at the end - all related to ancestry. The story is really on a nice track about racism and romance. I really like how the marriages turned out to be peaceful at the end. The book wasn't really about a wedding, but about the past relationships. I recommend this book to people who can sit through a long, heart- warming story. You may need to use weird vocabulary but you'll get through it! It's great how West partly includes you in her stories. Totally recommend it to ages 13 and up!"
3,Not what I expected,"I did not enjoy this book. It kept jumping back and forth. I thought it dealt too much with the past. It was written well, but the title should have been The Coleses."
5,"Now, this is a great book!!","Don't let the title decieve you, this book is about what happens surrrounding a wedding. The wedding of Shelby Cole, a pale skin, blonde hair, blue eyed African-American woman (yes, they really do exist) and her impending marriage to a white jazz musician in the late 50s. The book tells the story of her family. Going back as far as her great, great grand parents, both paternal and maternal. It is a feat that is accomplished in a small 240 page book. Rich with details. Told in a fashion that is so lyrical, so sweet that you are bound to become utterly enthralled in it. Dorothy West is an author for the ages. A masterpiece just waiting to be recognized."
2,Slow read,This was a book selected for our book club I found it a slow read. I was amazed with the ending.
3,A Hard Read for A Teenanger,"I thought that it had a great lesson in the end but, it had a lot of things that could be let out. I thought that in a lot of instances it became boring. I don't recommend it to anyone under the age of 17."
1,80% failure rate,"These are the worst DVD's ever purchased. I bought 2 50 packs and the first had 80% failure rate, I returned the other package. I called Memorex and they replaced the defective ones with Imation brand which worked perfectly, but it was a hassle & time to get them replaced. I'll never buy Memorex branded DVD's again."
2,"Great Nostalgia, yeah yeah yeah!","In my mind's memory, they were clever stories, good animation, full of Liverpudlian accents, and zany/campy madcap adventures, a la the Monkees.In reality, they are goofy, campy, irreverent, and show evidence of being dashed off to cash in on Beatlemania. That's part of the charm. The ""plots"" are developed to frame the music, which of course is superb. Ringo sports an authentic sounding Liverpudlian accent. Some songs are used, like a music video, to illustrate a simple story. Others are played as a singalong, while the lyrics are displayed over the screen.These really take me back to a simpler time in our culture. The caricatures of the Beatles' faces are cute, too."
5,a contemplative gem....,"....written about solitude and the spiritual life in the form of a series of meditations. Like all his work, written with wisdom, humility, and grace."
2,Disappointed,"Clips of Lady Gaga repeated continiously throughout the video. there were no videos of any popular songs.There was no one on one interview with Lady Gaga. The video was random stylists & analysts offering opinions of Lady Gaga's wardrobe, meanings of songs ,etc. and some British stylists & analysts comments were difficult to understand. The product discription was misleading. My wife is a Gaga fan & I bought this as a Christmas gift for her & we were both very disappointed."
1,Not worth even $1,"I had low expectations for this item to begin with, but it even fell below those. I needed a fast replacement for my well-worn latte frother that I had been using multiple times a day to mix my infant's formula. This product was the only one offered by Prime and I figured fast delivery was key. My mistake...as within 2 days, the thing doesn't work except if you simultaneously press the ""on"" button and the cover over where the batteries are located. Even then, the power is so poor that it's debatable as to whether it's worth the trouble."
1,Piece of junk!,"This thing was a complete waste of $$! The power switch does not work AT ALL. up or down, it just runs I have to bang it on the counter to get it to stop. And the power level is not consistent, sometimes it's slow, sometimes it's fast. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand. I like my frothy coffee but I hate the frustration! Who knew something so simple could be so difficult."
3,not for everyone !,This story is set way in the past and does go a little too much. The characters are memorable but the storyline is rather quirky. Very odd events occur throughout. The question of paternity in the tale remains unknown until the bitter end yet kept me reading until the bitter end.
5,A pearl,"This beautiful little book has continued to haunt me. It took me away from my daily existence to a shimmering island peopled by characters who were not of this world, but somehow still as familiar as my neighbors, my cousins, my mailman. Delicious."
4,A dark medieval sitcom,"The novel, even though it is sat in Medieval Europe, is structured very much like a sitcom. There are stereotypical characters that one may expect from a sitcom: the town stud (Gianluca), the town geek (Albertino), the fat girl (Ermenegilda), the myterious hottie (Miriam), the mandatory abusive single mom (Valentina) and the freaky child (Piarina). The interaction between the characters is very generic and stylicized. You can predict right away who will fall in love with whom. What you can not predict is the horrible outcome of the novel. The plot takes a sudden turn, and the small town idyll falls apart.I have no idea why the book critics called it ""delightful"". ""Delightful"" is not the word that comes to mind when you think about plague wiping out a whole village. There is nothing life-affirming in this book. If the reader expects a happy ending, he/she will feel deceived in the end. The book does not end with a wedding. It ends with a mass funeral."
3,"Definitely, not his best job.","Beto Guedes is a great artist, but this record is not the best one he has ever recorded. Most live versions of his musics are boring, like this CD shows. That's the opposite of his music's studio versions, that are great."
3,Not what we expected,"Don't get me wrong, it is a fun toy. However, when reading the previous reviews I was expecting something different. The biggest disappointment is that the light saber will not lock close and does not have a hook to attach to ones belt or waistband. This means that you can't carry it around between battles. Also, from some of the descriptions I thought that the light saber would actually change colour. It does not. It just lights up but the light is very poor and is only really effective in a dark environment. The sound effects are great though."
3,Mace Windu's eletronic lightsaber,"This is the lightsaber that I would buy my child.However,it does have a few problems.The lightsaber is a little large for the tikes.Plus,the lightsaber doesn't have a clip to stay on a person's clothing.Nor does the lightsaber go all the way in to the handle.The lightsaber requires four AA battries and it quite difficult to put them in.The lightsaber does have benefits.The lightsaber has pretty cool sound FX and moving it actully makes it sound like a real lightsaber moving.Hitting something makes it clash.The light that it gives of is bright and very enjoyable.This toy is also longer than most other lightsabers and one of the only to give off sound FX and light.Its pretty strong,but a few hard hits and it will get pretty messed up.All and all this lightsaber is good but not great."
2,"Came in the mail 5 days ago, already busted!!!","This toy was a lot of fun at first, and I had lots of great battles with my younger brother. It has great sound effects, but the light is really weird! First of all, when it does work, the light is very weak and you can hardly tell it's on. When it doesn't work, which is most of the time, the sound turns off as well as the light! We have another hasbro lightsaber, a clear one that's lights can be either red or blue, and we've had that for a long time and it has never had this problem. We don't have the box, so now we're stuck with a broken lightsaber!!! Do NOT buy this- look for a better one!!!"
4,Sorry you guys are all wrong....yep...,"I have no problems with saying that I am a geek, but yes, this is not mace windu's hilt, it is actually his from episode 1 when he never drew his lightsaber...it also had a blue blade. Mace actually makes the new electron (gold) hilt after becoming a senior council member. And this is not half of darth maul's lightsaber (the hilt that is), but now Plo Koon's lightsaber (dies in jedi starfighter, weird mask lookin dude). You can look up all this information in the DK Star Wars Visual Dictionaries. They are a great read! Pick them up also! I'm down with the purple also."
5,Old New York,The people that Joseph Mitchell introduces the reader to in these character sketches are representative of a New York that no longer exists and their stories are nostalgic and sentimental. But there is more here than that. Mitchell writes with a respect for his subjects regardless of their circumstances that reveals a true observer of life at work. Without a hint of judgementalism he takes the time to understand and the reader is rewarded and enriched as a result.This collection is particulary good and Up In The Old Hotel contains more of the same style. The latter book is more readily available although I found a copy of this at the Strand bookstore off Union Square.
1,Copy-Cat Plans,What a waste of everyone's time! Just the same old boiler-plate track houses with a few luxury upgrades and too much square footage. I don't see a significant difference from one house to the other. Wish I had saved my money!
5,Best Architectural magazine book,"This is a great Architectural magazine book for builders, designers and future home owners.The floor plans are exceptionally thought out, no big drywall or stucco boxes, no dead spaces, just real life experience design.Beautiful floor plans for sun shine state such as Cal and Fl.Truly recommended, I have two copies."
2,Uninspiring mass production homes,"I live in California and have been throughout the state admiring authentic ""Pure California"" homes. The homes represented in this book are not much different in design from a number of uninspiring tract homes I've seen from North to South. I was hoping to find some authentic Early California design when Pasadena was mentioned. I didn't realize these were all new subdivisions. I was disappointed. The addition of floor plans is always a great idea; these just didn't offer the architectural elements I was looking for."
5,It worked for me for 10 years,"I read this book and used it's method of weitht loss over ten years ago, and I kept the weight off. It works."
1,I thought I liked this band...,"I seem to remember that I liked this band. Now I don't know why. My God, they are terrible! The feedback SCREAMS all the time, and judging from what little I can make of the lyrics or the voice behind them, that might be a blessing. Call me, I will send this CD to you absolutely free just to get it out of my house. I'm sure they have fans, but so does Charles Manson. My ears are still bleeding and no, I don't think that's ""cool"". Ugh."
5,Circular Evidence,Very well written. First time that I've ever seen a scientific approach to this subject.I had never heard of ongoing circles at a given location over a 28 year period. Also thought that it was interesting that they used a small plane to find the circles. Bill R.
5,Great Book!,"I loved this book. Anyone who wants to see great pix of crop circles, this is as far as you need to go."
5,THEY'RE BAAAACK!!!!!,"Simply put, Unbreakable is the best Scorpion album since Face The Heat in '93.Frankly for years now I've been wondering if the Scorpions had lost it, after Pure Instinct, Eye to Eye and especially with Moment of Glory and their unplugged live album. Well not anymore!Unbreakable takes the Scorpions back to their hard and kick ass music of the '80s where the Scorpions made their mark in the first place.Love 'em or Leave 'em, Deep and Dark, Someday is now are just incredible hard rock songs. Accompanying the incredible see it from my eyes ballad ""a second coming of No one Like You.""The bottom line, Unbreakable simply ROCKS!"
4,Back to Basics!,"For the Scorpions, this release was a back to what got us where we are now release. Their was no more screwing around with their sound here.This my friends was the band returning to what they do best.What we have here is a good, solid, hard rock release. The trade mark Scorpions sound is back in all it's glory here. Every song is well structured and the result is a welcome return to past glory.They may never be as big as they were in their heyday in the 80's, but they have managed to progress nicely without losing what they are about. Eye to Eye was a bit off the beaten track, but they realised that and fixed it with this release.Check it out!"
5,Deadly venom!,"I got this CD as a gift from a friend and just had the opportunity to hear it today. There have been many bands who have enjoyed success, tried new and different approaches to their music and then returned to their roots. Fortunately, the Scorpions is one of those bands. I distinctly remember this band from the 1980s with their songs ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" and ""No One Like You"" and much of the songs on this album match the style of their 80s sound that defined the Scorpions and their style of music. Unfortunately, this album got scant radio play and coverage when it was released. However, do not let the minimal coverage keep you from getting this. Despite 3 songs on this CD I didn't like, this is an excellent album and should be noted as a little-known CD that has good quality rock songs. Kudos to the Scorpions for returning to the heavy metal sound that made them great!"
4,SCORPIONS,"How any one can call this a stinking pile IS NOT and I repeat IS NOT a true Scorpions fan.The Scorpions for years have put out great rock and roll music,music that is better than half the crap that is played on a radio.So when you listen to this album sit back and enjoy now,then go back and listen to their other albums and enjoy that too.The Scorpions are who they are and that is the GREATEST band that has ever played."
5,THE BEST ALBUM OF THE MILLENIUM,SCORPIONS Have Been The BEST In Their Career&I Got All Of Their Albums.I Love Them Cause They're Not Like Any Other Band&Have Their Own KICK_ASS Style.This Album Represents Their Actual Power As The BEST HARD ROCK BAND Ever.UNBREAKABLE Is The Symbol Of The True Rock Album Of All Time.SCORPIONS Are Back To Their Root(70's&80's Style) While Have Used New Rhythms&Tunes.I Give 5 STARS To All Of The Songs On This Album Cause All Of Them Are Unique.Once Again SCORPIONS Are Running Wild&NoOne Can Stop Them.BEST WISHES FOR SCORPIONS...
5,Scorpions still got it...and they give it!!!,"A new Scorpions album for the 21st century. Returning to their tried and true sound, with a mixture of hard rockers and power ballads. ""She Said"" will stand alongside of ""Wind of Change"" ""Still Loving You"" and ""Holiday"" in their canon of slow numbers. There are several blow your socks off rockers, and the riffing by Rudolph Schenker is simply out of hand! Many folks don't like the Scorps but as far as metal goes they are singular in their approach and in their sound. Metal will have to raise its ugly head to save music once again and Scorpions have struck the first blow in the new war against mediocrity and corporate crap in the music industry."
5,"cobias, you are a retard...","FACE THE HEAT WAS THE SCORPIONS WORST ALBUM, AND IT CAME OUT TEN YEARS AGO. This on the other hand is a true masterpiece. It may not have the hype or zing of an album like Judas Priest's Angel of Retribution, but it is very much in the vein of that album: a modernized sound, but very similar to the classic Scorpions, driven by power chords and reasonably simple basslines. Klaus has his trademark vocal stylings here too, which is a huge break for fans, because for a while Klaus wasn't himself at all. The bottom line: I think that the album sounds great, and I would get it just for the song ""Love 'Em Or Leave 'Em."""
4,Best Scorpions album in 20 years,"I'm a big fan of the earlier Scorpions material and therefore I have been quite dissappointed with the albums of the last decade or two. None of the music was memorable, and I only listened to the albums once or twice before they got burried deep in my record and cd collection. Unbreakable is the best album they have come out in a long time. They are back to their roots in playing those catchy hard rock driven tunes that bear the Scorpions signature. In fact this new album is the most played CD in my car now. It's been a while since they had some great songs. I just give it a 4 star rating because their earlier materials from ""Fly to the Rainbow"" to ""Tokyo Tapes"" really deserves a 5 star rating. However, this is the best hard rock album I heard this summer. I hope they'll continue in this line, because this is what all the Scorpions fans want to hear."
5,Awesome Album back to Classic Roots!,"Eye II Eye (1999) was a creative album with the radio hit ""Mysterious"" but still lacked the hardcore rock roots and I think the band was forgotten afterwords. My all time favorite album so far is the Crazy World (1990) ablum which had the major one hit ""Wind of Change"" which was played on MTV a lot. Pure Instinct (1996) was decent album with a few riffs that I liked which kept me loyal to the band. Another note on Eye to Eye II was its minor setback to where I didn't know where the band was headed. Its tracks in the album were trying to be too hip hop or something but lost. I was disapointed on this album where I thought the band was gone. However, I had a gut feeling when I heard about this latest album that I knew that the band resurrected to its old 80's rock riffs, and so far I am happy with its results and my money well spent. I like the new album now and it rocks!"
4,Scorpions are Back with New Generation!,"This album is the best in years...the song ""New Generation"" is currently among my favorite Scorpion songs ever...right up there with ""In Your Park, ""The Zoo"", and ""Winds of Change"". While this is an anthem song, it rocks more true to the Scorpions regular music. It is an anthem for a New Generation! This one song is enough to buy this CD for...Many of the other songs are good, but my other favorite song from this CD is ""Through My Eyes"" which is closer in style to some of the ballad rock hits mentioned above...If you like the Scorpions, you will love this CD!If you love metal or rock, you will love New Generation!If you love ballad rock, you will like Through My Eyes!"
3,Not the best,"Well, well. This album is good, but not that good. Actually, only one song that really rocks it's a ""New Generation"". Rest of it just OK. I've been waiting for something little bit better. I have all of Scorps albums, and, in my opinion, nothing can beat the ""Blackout"", ""Wind of Change"", ""Pure Instinct"" etc. Well, for real Scorpions fans this album must complete the collection, but nothing really special. Hopefully, Scorpions will come up in the future with better stuff."
3,Maybe better then Eye to Eye but...,"Nowhere close to ""Crazy World"" or any other of their releases. The song writing and production is disappointing. There are some flashes of the trademark twin guitar rhythm section but not enough in my opinion. Mostly weak tunes. Some of the songs sound like terrible anthems. I guess this is why they are not on a major label.I red these reviews before I purchased the CD. I thought I was buying a hard rock, back to basics CD. Not the case. Just because something is new does'nt mean it's good."
1,Are you all on crack??!,"I've been a long time Scorpions fan too, and I don't know what you all heard from this album.... but to my ears, this was a stinking pile.Klaus's voice was great, but the lyrics were horrendously bad (when you can understand his German accent... but as a long time fan I've gotten used to it).The performances from the band were mediocre at best. The riffs were lifted from a lot of sources, most notably their own songs. No real hair-raising guitar solos or fantastic drumming or bass playing. It's just boring corporate crap.I'll try to forget this album exists, but it will be hard to remove the poop stain that is this CD."
2,What are yall talkin' about?,This is an awful cd...The songs are boring.The lyrics are weak.Terrible..Just Terrible..
1,aweful piece,eye to eye and unbreakable are the worse ever recording for the scorpions. what went wrong with this legendary band? they should go back to their masterpieces and try to link it up to theur future projects. their last 2 releases are only deceptions.
3,POP ROCK 101...,"I did not care for this disc at all on the first listen. Then I played it again and again, and it is actually not that bad. I would have to label it mediocore though. I really like most of the rythem guitar work, but the majority of the solos are weak which to me is very disappointing since Rudolf, and Matthias are both great guitarists. Klaus Meine's voice sounds great as ever. The bass and drums are decent. The song writing lacks depth and creativity, and that and the lack of some blistering guitars riffs warrants 3 stars only, but if you like the scorpions or melodic rock buy this disc you will surely enjoy it..."
4,The Scorpion Lives,"I've been a Scorps fan for 20 years, but haven't had much interest in them lately. That changed when I sampled this at the local music shop and had to buy it. This is simply a fun rock album. Are any of the songs a megahit? No. Are there any ripping guitar solos that I'll still be talking about in 20 years? No. But the CD is solid. I've had it for 6 months and still listen to it regularly. That makes it a winner in my book."
2,Dont be fooled,I liked Scorpions in their first albums and especially In trance. Then they had some very good hits in some tracks and they now have their last 3 with this album be really bad. Forget about the really rock songs or the ballads thet made them famous. Its a total boring ususal album. Only for blindly huge fans of Scorpions and collectors
5,Scorpions Unbreakable,"I think the Scorpions CD Unbreakable is an excellent album all the songs sound great there really cool also,I have been a fan of the Scorpions music for a long time,this CD is excellent it's also in a plastic jewel case format too,If your a fan of there music you should add this CD to you collection then."
1,City of Angels/Michael,"I was very disappointed with this product. It is supposed to be a double feature City of Angels and Michael, my two very favorite movies. However, when I played the DVD only City of Angels was on the DVD. Michael was not.I'm very upset over this and will never buy from this seller again!Thanks for one movie when I should have received two!KD"
4,Applegator43,Double movie pack - both are excellent movies. Price is right also so you can't beat this offer. Amazon ships great also.
4,A great Two for One price!,"I have ordered this product from Amazon.com which I consider a great buy. It has two movies, City of Angels & Michael on one dvd. The price is great and if you are a fan of John Travolta & Nicolas Cage these are two movies that are a little different for both actors.The subject matter is Angels for both movies, and both actors made these movies before they started making action/drama movies with lots of violence. I guess it was a kinder & more gentle time."
3,Deal sounds better than it is,"I bought this because I mostly wanted City of Angels in widescreen, and this was actually cheaper than buying the DVD with only City of Angels.First of all you would expect both movies to be in widescreen format from the description on the Amazon product page, but only City of Angels is.Second, there is this big textual description on the back of the DVD about all the amazing extras about City of Angels. However, when you try to watch them, it says they are on the B side of the DVD. The only thing on the B side of the DVD is Michael. I suspect they took the A side from the regular wide screen edition of City of Angels, and instead of that B side just threw on Michael.I like both movies, and for both movies the price is pretty good. But it doesn't excuse the incorrect marketing. It only misleads the buyer."
2,MICHAEL IS FULL SCREEN NOT WIDESCREEN!,"I HATE full screen. I wanted WIDESCREEN. The advertisement product details clearly stated WIDESCREEN. I feel duped, betrayed and done out of, oh, less than 10 bucks. No big deal. But I still want Michael in wide so I wasted my money. Yes I'm a fan of City of Angels and yes, it's in widescreen, but I would not have purchased this DVD had I known Michael was full screen."
5,A Great Book For All Ages!,"In this new book of the monthly comic, Van is sent to find a lost zoid, but finds that zoid is cared for and safe. Returning to Lulu, the leader of Mule, Van discovers he was being tested of his ability to care for zoids! He sent to meet the mysterious Mr. Chen, who has taken in interest in him...Or is this Mr. Chen interested in one of his friends?! Black and White, with a short summary in the beginning, also includes a cast of characters. 38 pages, in a readable text. A wonderfully written book!"
5,Aaagh! Enjoyment overload!,"This is it, really, the Holy Grail for Crimheads, four discs of live mayhem from Ramblin' Bob Fripp and his Merrie Men of 73-74. Unless you're an obsessive bootleg collector, in which case you probably have these already, you can hardly fail to marvel at the fact that people actually played this stuff live and people paid to listen to them. It's a party pack of fun'n'laffs as the boys from Crim rip into some of the darkest and grimmest rock music ever created. It also has the pleasant bonus of some of Fripp's hilariously tongue-in-cheek stage announcements, plus a detailed booklet including extracts from Fripp's 1974 tour diary, many embarrassing photographs and some amusingly negative reviews. Improvs galore, which is a joy for those of us who like them and probably something of a pain for those who don't - but then, who really wants to hear yet another live version of 21st Century Schizoid Man?"
4,Best midprice gas grill,"I've had a few grills before this, and now had my Silver-B about 5 years. I recently rebuilt it and replaced burners and Flavorizers ($100), although the burners probably could have simply been cleaned with oven cleaner. This grill is not cheap and the parts are expensive, however everyone with one agrees they are great. They should last over 25 years with occasional parts replacement. The $600 grill at Sam's looks better and in many ways is better, but the Weber durability and design is the best in the industry unless you spane $1000 or more. Beware no gas grill under $1000 will truly sear steaks and for that you need charcoal. That said, I also have a Weber Smokey Mountain smoker that works as a charcoal grill with an easy modification. The Silver-B has made me a Weber man for life, the things are simply built like tanks with very intelligent design. I usually don't review products but I truly believe in Webers."
5,Weber,"We have used this grill for four years and it still works just as new. If you wish quality at a decent price, look no further. This is the greatest."
1,Global Logistics? Dont think I'd reccomed this....,"Zero stars so far.We bought the grill expecting it to be effortlessly shipped to our door. No luck. A full week after paying for the grill (and of course being charged) we got a call from ""Global Logistics"" whatever that is - some type of middleman delivery service I assume.Regardless one of us has to work from home to take delivery of the grill that we ordered. A whole day home to get the grill, as if it were the cable installation people or something. I will never order another big-ticket item from Amazon again - and recommend highly against buying this particular item if you live in the greater Boston area. We should have just gone to a store and grabbed the grill. Very unsatisfied with this experience on Amazon.com/Global Logistics."
4,Excellent Archer,"As with most of his books, complicated plot full of suprises, characters and Archer's tough but understanding view points and observations on people and life. Best to let the reader discover the story just want to say it is one of the best ones."
5,"Excellent book, but beware","This book is amazing, and really gives you a great comprehensive look into the theory of fiber bundles and K-theory. My only recommendation is that you have a very strong background in topology, including hoomotopies, homology and cohomology theory. I recommend at least 2 (graduate) courses in topology and possibly Hatcher's book as a precursor."
5,Scathing Fun,"This is a superb satire by the great director Marco Bellocchio. Brilliantly made and performed, the film is a scathing denunciation of the dreary opportunism that passes for ""spirituality"" in the age of John Paul 2 and Silvio Berlusconi."
3,God Bless the atheist,"Was there repentance? Was there canonization? Was there a mistress? (And, if so, was she a prostitute, a co-conspirator, or--more, simply--just a liar?)Perhaps one must be religious or Italian or intelligent (I am neither.) to understand this film. Yet I gave it time; I gave it thought. . .At the end of viewing, my popcorn was finished but the story wasn't."
5,Kamelot strikes hard with Siege Perilous,"The third release by PowerMetal group Kamelot. Full of emotion and classical elements, this record serve notice of the Knights best CD to date. All songs are arranged in a perfect blend of musicianship and song quality.The recent lineup change has only made them stronger. Incredible record from the Floridians."
2,"Good album, terrible production","This album doesn't suck. It has a lot of good songs, but the production is so terrible that I can't stand to listen to it. There is no dynamic range and it sounds like it was being played at a low volume; the guitars sound muddy and the drums sound over compressed. The vocals are reverbed to make them sound like you are in a big room with really bad accoustics.If you aren't a fan of Kamelot skip this and get Karma or The Fourth Legacy instead."
4,Siege Perilous,"Off the bat, it's a great CD, no two ways about it. However, there weren't any songs in particular that wow'd me or caught my ears. I wasn't expecting anything as awesome as ""New Allegiance + The Fourth Legacy"", ""Across the Highlands"", or ""Center of the Universe"" seeing as how most bands' early works aren't as good due to lack of development, but it would have been nice to have at least 1 song to catch my ear with a little bit of move to it or a powerful chorus. However, I would sooner listen to this CD as a whole, versus some other albums where I would only listen to a handful of songs only. I don't recommend this unless you're a serious Kamelot fan. If you're not, I recommend you start with some of their newer albums and work backwards, haha."
3,That title track!,"I wasn't big on Fourth Legacy, but I really wanted to give Kamelot another chance, because I hated to be hard on a band that obviously has a lot of talent (and their vocalist is really cool). This is mostly on par with Fourth Legacy - in other words, for the most part it lacks intensity and the production sucks. But the outstanding title track makes me give this one a higher rating. Siege Perilous is a long (but not long-winded) instrumental that completely rocks. I almost think the band would be better off taking the purely instrumental route...they have talent, and they don't seem to want their vocalist to have much presence (you can't hear him very well in the mix...get ready to tinker with your CD player's setup). In the end, it's no better than Fourth Legacy except for the title track."
2,Nightmare inducing,I guess I'm alone on this one but the graphic descriptions and cruelty of the villain in Montana Sky were too much for me. I love the well-developed relationships of Nora Roberts' characters and this one was no exception. I finished the story but I had to skip the parts about the villain. Way too vicious and detailed for me. True Betrayals was a 3 star for me. I won't be reading Sanctuary after doing a brief preview of it; I don't need the nightmares. This one won't be added to my Nora Roberts collection; it's going to the used book store.
5,Great books!,"I own all three of these books, but not in one big volume. But, if I didn't, I would buy this book. All three are great stories, and worth buying! I love Nora Roberts and Montana Sky, Sanctuary, and True Betrayals are great romances with plenty of other things for readers."
1,This just in... This book stinks,"This book proves that individuals in the gay community can write junk books with the worst of mainstream publishing-It is lightweight at the very best, sappy and sophmoric at its worst-I cant believe a publisher would pony up the dough for not one not two but three books which don't have anything funny or enlightening to say about the gay community or the human condition?"
3,Not the full set!,"I received my book quickly. I bought this book under the 24 vol. set listing and it was only one book of the 24. The listing was very misleading. Double check before you buy that you are getting a set, not a book."
2,"Entertaining, but","What was the purpose of the story? It kept me entertained on a flight to the UK, but if the in flight entertainment system had been working, I'm not sure if I would have finished it.The version I read had questions for discussion which I found interesting, unfortunately, my book club was unable to find any meaningful answers to the questions raised.Throughout the book he wrote little blurbs about characters living in the town or near by. You expect them to have some relevance to the story, but they are never heard from again. It's almost as if these blurbs were put in to meet a page quota.I'm not usually a book snob, but I would turn my nose up at this one."
4,Dialogue doesn't get any better than this,"This is not Edgerton's funniest book. That would be In Memory of Junior. But it's still full of wonderful insight into the life and especially the dialogue of rural and small town people. Edgerton is so dead-on with the way these folks talk and act and think, it's scary. Anyone from this neck of the woods will immediately recognize friends and family members. I think Edgerton's more than just a regional writer, though, and he deserves wider recognition."
2,Great Idea and beginning botched to the extreme!,"This book starts off like a classic adventure in the desert - `Raiders of The Lost Ark' or `King Solomon's Mines'. But Higgins phones this one in; that is, what starts as a geo-political romp with Nazis chasing lost treasures is quickly turned he-man superman heroics. Charcaters (i.e. Muller) are inconsistent and unrecognizable; the dialogue pulp and stilted as a B action movie; the action unbelievable and the ending a yawner. I wanted a Good adventure, which Higgins has provided me over many novels, but I got junk. Very disappointing!"
3,"A ""fair"" Higgins book, but not on par with the best.","Definitely a slow starter, and once the action begins, it's pretty tame anyhow. Perhaps my least favorite Higgins book, and that largely due to it's predictablity and similarity to Indy stuff...worth a read, I suppose."
3,A pretty good adventure novel.,"This is another Jack Higgins adventure novel. Well written, good plot, likeable characters. A little slow in some parts, such as the beginning, but when the adventure comes it is fun to read. A person looking for a book somewhat similiar to The Indiana Jones movies, look to Sheba. But don't get to hyped up out about it. It isn't near as good as Indy, but it is still fun. I think most adventure lovers, will find this book fair enough"
2,Disappointing,"The short summary of the story that appears on the back of the book leads one to believe that the book is about a German attempt to destroy the Suez canal just prior to the invasion of Poland in September 1939. However, this is really only a minor part of the story and seems grafted onto the main story - the discovery of the temple of Sheba and the search for a missing archelogist. As pointed out by other reviewers the story is a bit Indiana Jones-ish but the book does pre-date those movies.The book is a quick read and well written but it was predictable and unbelievable."
2,Disappointed,"I bought these phones Feb. 7, 2010, after my third Clarity phone stopped working. These two are still working, but the display is shot on both of them (as of July 2010). It doesn't show the phone number of who's calling or the number I'm punching in. I might also warn anyone who is hard of hearing away from these phones as the ringer is so soft that I can only hear it if I'm within a few feet of the phone."
3,"A Pro-Christian, Anti-drug slasher movie","yes...who would have thought that would exist and that it would involve a nod to ""The Fly"". Basically the story is that the character Hershal, a Vietnam veteran is traveling the highway when he meets a girl who takes him to a drug party where he takes a series of drugs, then gets a job testing some scientific breed of turkey which causes his head to turn into a turkey head. He then goes around killing drug dealers, till he prays and repents to god to take away is affliction....for a novelty, its pretty fun, but not something you'd really wana see on your shelf. $15 is a bit much for this movie."
2,some of the best CHEESE ever!!!!,"This is a hideous movie and worth it for the cheese alone. This has EVERYTHING!!!!! Sex,drugs,and poultry. THANKSGIVING WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. Nothing like has ever been seen before!!!!"
2,This author is not a good researcher at all.,"All I have to say, is that if a guy who lives in New York doesn't know that ""Dr. J"", Julius Erving played for the 76er's not the Knicks(page 23)I can't trust anything else he writes. How did the editor and the publisher, based in New York miss this small detail. If they missed this you can't trust anything this guy writes. I grew-up a stones throw from Compton in Long Beach and this author should have went out and talked to the real OG's if he wanted to be creditable. Mr. Ro needs to really be careful when writing about peoples lives ,this is no joke. It has grown to organized crime and no one is untouchable. END"
1,He almost fooled me,The book started off good for the first 150 pages and just went downhill. This book should be called Rap for Dummies. The author of this book needs to stick to magazines.
2,Major disappointment,"What should have been a fascinating book, at the very least as a voyeuristic experience, fails to deliver largely due to its poorly written pages. The text stumbles along from incomprehensible link to allusive derailment, making the mistake of huge chunks of repetitive material which inevitably detract from the fascinating subject matter. Perhaps more of an editng disaster than an author's failure.....at the heart of which lies a story deserving a more coherent telling."
4,Good look into Death Row/Not enough 1st hand evidence,"Ronin Ro does an adequate job of detailing Death Row Records, though the book lacks new information. I rate this book so highly primarily because of the quality of information about the history of Death Row, its artists, and its business. As a reader that is interested in the makings of ""gangsta rap"" and the motives behind this artform, I couldn't put the book down. Ro does a good job of presenting a wealth of information in the book, though was weak in organizing the book. A Must Read for any Death Row fan or anyone that is curious about the label and its artists."
2,It could've been great,"I was so hyped to read this book. The subject matter is fascinating, scandalous, timely and emotional. The writing, however, is abysmal. Apparently the publisher's fact-checkers were snoring on the job [the Ballage Hotel (Bel Age)in Los Angeles! ]. The text is very choppy, repetitive, disorganized, and awkward. I was shocked to learn that Ronin Ro is a journalist for national magazines. He's got a lot to learn about the art of writing. His editor is especially to blame."
2,Just OK.,"I disagree with the reviewers who found this novel stunning, exquisitely written, brutal, and caring. It's true that the author is nonjudgmental, but I'm going with the reviewer who called it minimally effecting -- I didn't even bother to finish it"
5,Raw Real Life Devoured in Two Days,"I wasn't expecting to be impressed by the so-already-told story of a junky in the 80's, thus it struck me fully by surprise when I found myself so immersed into Yablonsky's words that life around me seemed to pause during the mere two days it took me to finish it. She succeds at getting the reader in the skin of every one of her characters."
4,the straight dope,"Devoid of the stream-of-consciousness rambling that accompanies many stories in which drugs are at the forefront, Yablonsky's narrator gives us the straight dope (pun intended) about how a regular girl might come to use heroin, begin dealing, become a junkie, and get busted. The book is fascinating and realistic, which leads me to believe Yablonsky might either be very close to her story or be extremely skilled at research. The writing is very matter-of-fact, and our unnamed narrator could be anyone. The reader identifies and empathizes with her. The consequences of her use are neither minimized or exaggerated. Very well-written and engaging."
1,THEY SENT ME THE WRONG PRODUCT!,I thoguht i was ordering the Eye Bryten and they sent me the UNDER Eye Bryten! The product in the picture is what i thought i was getting but they double crossed me! Do not order from this company as they are scamming us!
3,Eye Bryten,I received the product hoping it would work really well. I am about 50% convinced it will work for me. I have not used all the 1oz bottle yet.
1,No effect whatsoever,"I've not had much luck with under-eye creams. I have very stubborn dark under-eye circles and bags that just will not go away. I've tried almost everything under the sun, and my most recent one was this product.Of all of the products, this is the worst I've tried. At least other products reduced the circles a little, if not completely. But even after using this stuff twice a day (morning and evening) for 3 months, it's had absolutely no effect. I even have co-workers who constantly say I look more and more tired and tell me to get more sleep!Don't waste your money on this stuff."
4,Good product,"The product is good I'm starting to see some results after four weeks, I believe over all the product is good."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,I returned the product and I have never received the refund. I tried to contact the seller but I have not received any response.
4,Pretty good,"The Bargain is the romance of Alexander, and Thorne. Alex is a tomboy who is use to doing what she want. Thorne is use to women acting like women and not questioning everything he say. I throught Francis Ray did a great job writing a historical novel."
2,Nice try Ms. Ray but no cigar...,"I bought this book because it was written by Ms. Ray. All her books in the past have been great, however, this book fell way short. I do respect Ms. Ray with her attempt to write about other cultures set in different time periods. That is very tough and she made a good attemp. However this book was horrible and too predictable. Also, the main characters were all just a bit over the top. Stick with what you know Ms. Ray thats what your good at...."
3,Richard Hell+Don Fleming+1/2 of Sonic Youth,"equals mucho noise.A violent, spasmodic offering that alternately fascinates and bores, and this EP is too short to have holes in it. But their cover of ""Christian Rat Attack"" contains, and this is not hyperbole by a long shot, some of the most chilling, out of control guitar molestation this side of The Velvet Underground's ""I Heard Her Call My Name"". If you understand what I mean by that, this EP is worth a pickup."
2,Not Complete,This atlas does NOT contain all the counties in Michigan - It's lacking all of the southern counties in the U.P.
1,Page issues,"There are missing pages, there are duplicate pageS... Disaster. Don't waste your money. We were relying on this map to travel around Michigan....sadly it left us hanging many times."
2,Michigan County Atlas,"The book is very large, but the print and maps are very small. Some of the maps take up two pages, but part of the map is unreadable because it's lost in the binding. I have an older Michigan County Guide, by a different company, and it has more details and is easier to read. This book is missing many roads, if you need to find a major place you'd probably find it with a magnifying-glass, but for those small areas and streets - forget it they are not on these maps."
3,"Great, except for counties not included!","Great map, there arent too many with the township and range. However, it doesn't include all of Michigan's counties, not good for my line if work."
4,Good but.....,"Everything I was looking for as far and the details for roads and parks, but it is missing some UP counties. I would have liked that info for snowmobiling and will have to buy another map."
1,Missing counties,"I purchased and then returned this map. I wanted a Michigan county map as we were going camping in the Upper Peninsula. Imagine my surprise when I received the map and found it did not have all the counties in Michigan, especially in the U.P. Very disappointing, doubt if I buy from this map maker again."
1,Non functioning Doorbell Intercom,"The Westinghouse Whole-House Wireless Doorbell and Intercom does not work. Customer service explained that unit must be powered directly from a clean wall plug and not plugged into a power stip. While the building is new and the wiring is very clean power, the unit only worked when tested two times. We never managed to get the system to function with the main unit being indoors and the bell unit outdoors.With luck the money will be refunded. The unit will not hold up in an outdoor environment. If we could have made it work, a protective housing would have to have been built."
4,"Frederick Franck, editor of R. H.Blyth's Great Works","Franck's ""Zen and Zen Classics"" is his editing of the writings of R. H. Blyth on Ch'an/Zen, which are otherwise out of print. It is a great book, specially since it contains the only in-print works of Blyth, who, Franck says, is the indispensible interpreter of Zen for the western mind, and that Blyth is the ever-open eye. This is a great book, and can lead to even greater ones by Blyth---if onlt they would print more."
4,Just what the (Net) doctor ordered,I'm amazed at how many times I've used this tool and I've only had it a week. Everything works as prescribed and it appears to made of very high quality metal. The only tool element that is disappointing is the UTP stripper. Mine does not look like the one in the flash and it will not strip UTP without mangling the wire.
4,almost there,"I purchased the PT-525 because I saw an add for it and it had the tools used by most telcomm techs. The tool is assembled very well and the initial quality seems to be above average. I say almost there because it seems that everyone out there that manufactures these multitools seems to forget one very important thing. (1) the most used tool should be the easiest to get out and use. The knife/blade on almost every brand including this one requires the tool to be opened etc. fold this etc. etc. etc. The knife should be the easiest to get out and use. The Leatherman Wave is close, but lacks the telcomm tools. The leather pouch for the PowerPlay seems very flimzy. I know already that the tool will probably outlast 3-4 pouches. For now I guess I'll still use a separate pocket knife for those quick cut and stow jobs."
4,Great Multitool,"This knife is really nice. Its extremely durable, yet all the tools move smoothly. The leather pouch that comes with it is made extremely durably as well unlike a lot of belt-type pouches. The only thing I wish this knife had was sissors, as this is something I use a lot on my Swiss Army knife.So far, this knife has helped me out on a lot of different projects and has yet to fail me."
3,"Great on paper, not so great in real life","I used this (I actually had the 540, but it's pretty much the same)for 3 years as a cabling tech. I was all excited to have a multi-tool that had 110 and 66 blades in it. It just wasn't that sturdy. Several things bent or broke within 6 months of use. I wasn't that upset when I forgot it on the roof of my truck when I drove home one day.The knife was good, the drywall saw was nice to have in a pinch. The jaws really did provide an hell of a grip. This one doesn't have scissors like the 540, which is good cuz they were crap. However the 525 doesn't have the butt splice crimper in the head, which was great to have at hand all the time.It had several functions that where nice when you were doing a job 40 feet up on a ladder, in a factory, with a 15 minute round trip to the truck.It was HUGE and HEAVY. It wasn't worth the price IMHO."
3,Great tool with a serious flaw,"I have used this tool steadily for over 2 years. I has been very useful and is made of quality materials. Obviously it is not designed for extended punchdown/cut-over type work, but comes in very handy when you are in some distant data closet, or crosswire cubbyhole and don't have all your tools with you. The flaw is in the design of the plier hinges. There are two bushings which form the core of the hinges, the bushings are internally threaded on each end and retained in the handle by screws. These screws perpetually back themselves out as the tool opens and closes. I perpetually tighten them. Occasionally one gets lost. I replace it (get ready for this) with a common computer case screw. Fits perfectly. Great you say, how convenient. It is convenient except that now I have lost a bushing. The tool is largely useless without it. I am writing this review pending information from Paladin on parts availability and/or a solution to the problem."
2,OK but the connection doesn't stay in well,"Does what it's supposed to do, plain and simple. However, it seems the cable easily comes loose from the computer pretty often. I've lost scheduled recordings (DVR) because of this and it's super annoying. If you wiggle it just a little, that could mean the difference between a disconnected drive/connected drive. So if I am plugging another device into the computer, I always have to remember to check if the drive gets disconnected because the machine may have budged a little. I may have to pay more and invest in a better cable later down the road."
1,Poorly made,"I used the cable for 3 months and it worked as it should. But it ultimately came apart at the ends, exposing the wires. It isn't worth the cost to return, but i suppose that is what they count on?I wouldn't buy it unless it was going to be plugged in on a permanent basis."
1,"Awful, leaves ragged nails behind","I bought these at superpetz, I figure at 6.99 they would be decent clippers, not a chance. Now I have to return them and that is why I am here :) Looking at the reveiws to get a good pair."
5,Words from THE names in movie sound.,"If you're intersted in movie sound, this one is a gem. LoBrutto interviews the people who made some of the greatest impacts in film sound in the last 25 years. We're not just talking about legends like Ben Burtt and Walter Murch (Star Wars & Apocalypse Now, respectively) but the whole gauntlet of roles that make up what we hear at the movies. Production sound mixers, ADR (looping) editors, Foley artists, supervision sound editors, sound designer, boom mikers, music editors. You get conversations with top names in every field. I learned a great deal about what goes into making the overlooked half of what makes a great movie."
5,Favorite,We bought this as a back up for my son's current favorite baby(the same penguin). It's so cuddly and sweet. Glad to have it.
4,Ten Little Indians on steroids,"This movie of course is reminiscent of the ""Saw"" franchise, but manages to put it's own spin on things. The thrills and chills here are based on good writing, acting, and a plot that works, not some big budget explosion fest. When I am still thinking about the movie a day later, I know it worked for me."
3,"Yeah, I've been to this party","I found this an effective little horror/suspense thriller about a group of friends who get together for innocent fun and find themselves in a Saw-like situation. Who's hosting the fun and games? Is it the cameraman obsessively videoing every moment, to the annoyance of all? Or is it someone else? The minister maybe? Shades of Bunuel, with a nifty script and skilled ensemble acting."
4,SOC 298: Modern Social Problems,This was the assigned text for my sophomore social science seminar and I really enjoyed the book (as well as the class!) The author expresses himself extremely well and I hope more people are reading this book than just those in my SOC class.
1,Like a lullaby it will put you to sleep,"This is an awful movie.The story line is non-existent, the characters are empty, and the editing/directing are childish. The movie was built around the special effects (and those are not special at all) of zombies eating flesh. Garbage, not only should you not buy this, don't even watch it. Thankfully I borrowed it from my library so it only cost me 90 minutes of my life."
2,Not what I expected. Mostly an ad for his business.,"This book was not what I expected. ( I have not read his other books, but did read several articles and saw him on TV before hand). Although I agree with the ideas expressed, I found myself drowning in statistics, and felt it was all a big ad for his business. I even found a coupon for his frozen health food in the book! All I really got out of it was that talking about your problems with your loved ones will help the healing process. I did not need hundreds of pages of stats and quotes from seemingly hundreds of researchers to figure this out. However, the narratives of actual interaction with couples who acted out angry scenes and changed their words was outstanding. it reminded me of Tony Robbins. Overall it could have been condensed and if you want it, wait for the paper copy!"
2,Just wasn't what I was looking for,"Lot of medical stuff in this book. Not an easy read. Directed mainly at that ""A"" type personality. The jest of it was that you absolutely can not go around uptight, high strung, and silent. You need to let down the walls and let people into your life."
4,Jack London's South Sea Tales is a good read.,"Jack London stories are classics, and give a different viewpoint on the world before the current culture. They were written at that time by someone who experienced it, so they are very different than stories written by modern writers who have to sort of guess at what it was really like."
2,Eh,Nice watch but VERY large and heavy. Weighs a couple pounds. Band has broken a couple times on me because of the wight and now it is out of warranty.
4,Unreleased B.S.,"So I think the cool thing about these box sets is that you don't have tto go out and buy both import CD's to get all the remixes and b-sides from the CD singles. But you also don't get the 12"" mixes. Whats up with that???? There's a Deep Dish remix of ""I Feel Loved"" that was completely left out of this set. There are other songs as well. I can only assume that DM ran out of room for that stuff. Overall it's a worthy Box Set. I only hope they take a cue from the fans and release a 7th Box Set maybe full of rarities, unreleased tracks, semi-unofficial remixes (like all the Razormaid mixes!) And maybe even studio outtakes. I mean if the Beatles can do it...why can't DM?"
5,Depeche Mode Singles box 6,"Wow WOW WOW most stuff made by Depeche Mode is wonderful, but if you add some super good mix boost like it was done on this set by great DJ's we have a good final effect."
5,Love it!!,"I have used Dana's Monsieur Musk for years and continually get complimented about it. Am told that it smells like I just got out of the shower, very clean. Am always asked what is it."
3,Ipod Mini,"I have recently bought my Ipod Mini about two months ago. All in all I think it's great, I take it everywhere I go. But it there are a few problems that irratate me frequently:+The bateries run out in about 6 hours when they should last a lot longer.+To turn it off you have to hold down the ""Play arrow"" and usually when I attempt this my Ipod goes crazy and starts playing random songs and refuses to turn off."
5,Incredibly Fast Shipping!,"Cheers to Amazon! I bought this IPod as a gift for my fiancée's burf-day, so I haven't even taken it out of the box yet, but I had to write a quick note singing their praises. Amazon's logistics and delivery network is unbelievable.I opted for the free shipping offer (Super Saver Discount), which Amazon claims will ship in two to three days. I placed the order around 2:00 PM CST, yesterday (3/21/05), only to have it show-up on my desk at work at 10:30 AM CST, today (3/22/05). That's a total of 20.5 hours for Super Saver Delivery.I will say that my home in St. Louis, MO isn't extremely far from Amazon's distribution center in Lexington, KY, where this package was shipped from - about 350 miles. But still, I've ordered pizza's that have taken longer to get here.Way to go Amazon!"
3,Good Starter MP3 Player,"This is another generation of a long line of Apples Ipods.This is a good starter mp3 player,but eventually you'll see its flaws and want better.It is nice for a casual music listener,but some of us like me think 1,000 is nothing.The price though more then makes up for it.Ipods are the most familiar MP3 player out.Their price is upsetting for anything 20GB and up.So this as said is cheap.The spin wheel is wicked.It makes it alot easier to pick a song and no individual button clicking wich takes hours on large libraries.The color is girlish or preppish.I got it at a reduced price as it was a open store model and pink didn't sell too well at the Best Buy i went to.If you can get this at a cheaper price then it's list go out and buy it.If not,well don't save alittle more and get the cream of the crop.(The screen lights up,but no color battery life is decent)"
2,Not impressed,"Our iPod failed twice within the first week of purchase. Apple said the first call for assistance to their tech support line was free. But the second time we called, they said that a fee would be charged. They ultimately agreed to help us for free. We sent the iPod back after the second failure and are now waiting for a replacement. We cannot recommend an iPod."
1,"iPod works fine, STAY AWAY FROM APPLE AND ITUNES!!!!","When I first got my mini, I was extremely excited. I put some CD's on iTunes, then tried to put the songs on my mini. It didn't work and I went through a very irritating and frustrating process. I finally got it to work, but I had another problem later. I am very good with computers, yet I have had soooo many problems. Apple ""Support"" doesn't give you any help and just confuses you more. I suggest you try another brand, or at least do more research first. I hope that you listen to me because I know what I'm talking about and I'm not the only person with these problems."
2,"I Love It, But....","When I first bought it I was SO excited b/c I bought it in Pink (my favorite color). My interest soon faded. The battery is VERY weak. I get about 6 hours of battery life instead of the advertised 18. Since it's internal, it's a little hard to replace. And sometimes the click-wheel freezes so I'm stuck listening to the same playlist until it decides to work again."
1,Bad Ipod. Good Customer Support.,"Worked well for 5 months and stopped working. Trying to update software gives ""Firmware update fail. Disk write error"".This seems to happen for many people. Just search web for ipod ""Firmware update fail"". You will find many people struggling with this error.It is a real piece of junk."
4,Cool,This is the coolest little MP3 player theres only one thing that i dont liike about it is that the battery duznt last as long as it says it duz.
1,Where is my charger to go with this ipod???,"There is nothing to be said about ipod minis and how fantastic they are. But where is the charger to go along with the ipod from this particular vendor!!! It's like selling someone a car without a steering wheel. This is the 3rd ipod I bought from Amazon and the first two came with a charger as you would expect! But this one, which I bought a s a mother's day gift came without one and makes it completely ungiftable. Yes yes the description does not include one, but come-on, it is only common sense that a charger should be included, when you pay the same price as one that would have it!!!"
3,VERY DELICATE SCREEN BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!,Apple will not repair this item if your screen is broken in any way. One day my ipod screen went all liney and I sent it in. Mac said there is nothing they can do and I would have to just buy a new one. I see people jogging dancing doing whatever and I just had it in my pack with a protective cover. THEY SAID!! Oh the screen is sooooo very delicate it could break very easily. Yet they will not cover the replacement. I have only had my Ipod Mini for a few months. I am completely utterly upset right now!!!!! There was no misuse of my Ipod. Be very aware!!!!!!!!!!!
2,overrated,"Like others have reported, the hard drive in the Mini is very delicate. My wife's died within about 10 months. It can't be fixed, you have to get a new one.So that's why the new Nano, which came out only about 1-2 years later doesn't used a hard drive.Don't buy the Mini used, get a Nano."
1,Don't buy the mini ipod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought an ipod mini about a year and a half ago. This was the worst purchase of my life! Never buy this ipod. The menu button stopped working(this is the most used button- ipod mini is not functional without it!) and the play/pause button stopped working. I took it into an apple store to the genius bar(where they ""fix"" products) and all they told me was that i could get a new ipod with a 10% discount if i give them my mini to recycle. I'm not sure what new mp3 i'll get, but it won't be an apple."
1,"Just say ""No"" to Mini's","Screen is small and you can't see very well. Color on mine chipped. iTunes would delete my songs, leaving me from 105 songs to 5 songs. Not a good product. Ended up returning it after a long struggle of trying to fit the USB cord in it. Restless of trying to fiddle with it, I brought it back and relized there was no refund. Actually, they wanted me to pay THEM for me returning it! Ha, yeah right.As the iPod Video came out, I thought it would be junk, seeing as how unhappy I was with my iPod Mini. My husband wanted one, though, so I purchased one (this time making sure there was a good return policy). That thing is 10x better! I actually envy it and hope to get one of my own. Look for a Nano or a Video if you're going to spend 200 - 400 dollars on an mp3 player you want to last."
2,Do not waste your money...,"Buy a regular iPod instead. I bought mine around a year ago and sometimes it is unresponsive the rest of the time the screen freezes up and you have to wait for it to be responsive again...My friend also had the same problem. And supposedly there was a recall on the mini iPods? The ""regular"" iPods might be more expensive but, it's better than the mini."
3,DON'T BUY THE MINI!!! IT WILL HURT YOU IN THE LONG RUN!!!,"this is the second ipod mini ive owned (the first one being a lemon) and ive had this one for about 10 months. although the sound quality is excellent and the materials are of superb quality, the battery isnt functioning properly, and i think the thing has a life of its own! sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. ive taken it to many apple stores explaining my situation and no one has really offered much help. they did a battery test and said it was fine when it really wasnt. its also waaaaaaaaay overpriced (i have a 1st gen with 4GB, and at the time, it was $250; its come down to $199, but thats still way to much compared with other mp3 players). NO WONDER THIS THING WAS DROPPED!!! in conclusion, dont buy it, but get a regular 20GB ipod cuz it supposively works much better, has a longer battery life, and you get 16 or 14 more GB (depending on the model) for only $50-100 more!!!!"
1,Wrong purchase,I bought a pair of these gloves and it was not until I opened the package that I realized they are for the same hand. They were supposed to protect my hands from the food slicer but they are both for the left hand. Hmmmm. I don't know what to say.
2,Don't like the smell of the glove,"This glove smell very bad when it is new. I guess maybe all glove made of this Kevlar material all smell bad.Beside the smell, I don't feel the glove comfortable to wear. I will try to buy other glove to see if they are better.However, this glove is inexpensive, compare with other glove."
2,Eh,Sturdy work gloves but difficult to work in as they are really thick and not very form fitting. I send them back.
5,Don't worry about large being TOO LARGE,"Don't worry about large being TOO LARGEIn fact as of today, they no longer sell the medium size.I have both large and medium.If you have large hands, then these may be too small.If you want to see how they will fit, they are a hair smaller than a large golf glove.So if you wear an extra large golf glove, then I would look around some more.I still gave it 5 stars and will be getting another pair when I need $7.00 for shipping"
2,Weed Thorns Came Through,This glove was similar to the kevlar glove I had before (8 yrs ago) and worked perfectly. I used the glove for pulling thorny weeds by hand ( I can't remember the name of the weed). The old one never had thorns go through gloves. This new one did. I got surprised that the thorn went through. I guess I can't use it for this purpose. I did not try it with a knife as other reviewers had done it.
3,Not good with mandolin use,"I have the correct size fitting ones for my hands. After a few uses with these, the mandolin cut into the glove, finger didn't get cut but still the Kevlar didn't hold up.I now use these glovesBladeX5 57100 Classic Cut & Slash Resistant Gloves Cut Resistant Level 5 EN388 CE Approved, grey, Mediumfor mandolin uses which is said to hold up better to mandolin use than the blue ones. What's a few dollars more to keep your finger tips?"
5,CUT RESISTANT GLOVES,"I HAVE CUT MY SELF SO MANY TIMES WITHOUT USING A PROTECTIVE GLOVE. THESE GLOVES HAVE SAVED MY FINGERS MANY TIMES. I HAVE ANOTHER VERY UNUSUAL USE FOR THEM. WE HAVE 3 KITTENS THAT ARE ALWAYS NEEDING THEIR NAILS CLIPPED. NO MORE POKE INJURIES FROM THEIR VERY SHARP LITTLE NAILS! I NEED ANOTHER PAIR FOR MY HUSBAND, HE IS THE PERSON THAT HAS TO HOLD THEM DOWN. AFTER WE ARE DONE I KEEP THEM ON MY HANDS AND USE DISH SOAP AND WATER TO CLEAN THEM, HANG ON A RACK TO DRY AND THEY ARE READY FOR THE NEXT JOB!"
5,good gloves,"these gloves fit well and are not slippery when holding stuff. i like em for work, and what not, to wear on my hands."
5,true to its purpose.,"I actually goofed when ordering these gloves as I totally forgot about sizing. I wear size x-large gloves and luckily, these came in size large as the default size. To return to Amazon, I would have to incur shipping cost, there and back, and lost the perk of free shipping on my initial order. I decided to simply wait and try on the gloves to see if they would work, and they do. I'm not sure if I'll use them for their original purpose which was to wear when using a mandoline food slicer. They seem perfect for yard work around thorny trees, bushes, roses, etc. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase and the gloves are certainly of high quality."
4,oyster gloves,"Flexible, strong- perfect for shucking oysters. 4 stars only because wrist cuff could be a bit higher. Husband loved it."
2,Type of cut resistance should be specified,Bought these gloves to prevent cuts from my mandoline slicer. My first time using them and the tip of the glove got caught between the potato and the blade and was effortlessly cut through. It would seem these gloves are more resistant to slicing than shearing.
3,not very impressed by the quality of the gloves.,"these are a must have gloves if you are not a pro in the kitchen. they can save your fingers. I perhaps should have invested in a higher quality pair, because these seems very cheap. the stitching is starting to peal after only 2 weeks of use =("
4,Great for use with sharp instruments,Great to use it you don't want to slice the tips of your fingers off when using a mandoline. I learned the hard way. Best 8 bucks I've spent.
3,Better than nothing...,"I had already read the reviews, so my expectations were low, and appropriately so. These are as reliable as other gloves of similar thickness, but no more so. They give you an extra split-second to stop a sharp knife before it cuts through the glove and into your skin if cutting straight on, and fully defect a blade coming at a flat angle."
4,"G & F 1607XL Cut Resistant 100-Percent Kevlar Gloves, Heavy Weight...",Using this product with mandoline.The rubber layer is not cut resistant and the glowe will soak water.Much safer then using mandolin without protection.
1,I never used them.,I never used them as I purchased them to go with the Benriner Vegetable Slicer that I returned as well.
2,False sense of security,"When I purchased a mandolin slicing device, Amazon helpfully suggested slash-resistant gloves. Be warned: They don't stop blades. I tried pushing into the edge of a mandolin, a carrot in the glove instead of my finger. It cut quite easily a 1cm hole in the tip of the glove, into the carrot 5mm. The gloves are ill-fitting and it is very hard to hold most food, making a slip more likely. It seems likely the gloves will create a false sense of security.They are easily cut with scissors or a knife. There is considerable disclaimer that these are ""slash resistant"" and not ""cut proof"". One would be well advised to take this seriously and understand the difference between ""cut"" and ""slash"", ""resistant"" and ""proof"". It isn't just a disclaimer to help avoid liability, but a necessary warning."
5,Cut Resistant 100% Kevlar Gloves,"This is the rating that these gloves deserve. The first time we used them was to grate cheese for a hot dip and guess what!?... no scraped knuckles or nicked fingernails! These gloves are a ""goldfind""!!"
3,Gloves,"I thought they for cutting as well as oven gloves, not too great for ovens, .They will be great for garden work.Had similiar gloves and they worked great out doors and for cutting."
3,Gloves,I purchased thes gloves for shucking oysters. The medium size gloves I received are a bit small and make for a tight fit.It was difficult to put them on because the interior was full of threads that had to be broken to put the glove on
1,Vietnam Adventures,Vietnam Adventures - this video is BAD - REAL BAD. Rick Hunt does not even know how to hold the camera straight - Do NOT get suckered in by the DVD packaging - DO NOT BUY THIS BAD HOME MADE VIDEO - give your money to a Vietnam charity -
3,Homemade video but good nonetheless,This is a handheld homemade video with little narration and editting. However saying that I did enjoy it as it provided a really authentic experience.
5,"""A Word From The Angels""","""A Word From The Angels"" has deeply transformed my life. At an extremely low point in my life, I read this miracle book. It gives full and beautiful accounts of actual angel experiences by everyday normal people. All of the stories each person has to tell, showers one with great chills, knowing they are true. To read this book, truely changes one's life. It has had this same effect on my friends who have read it.If you are ready, it will indeed transform your life. Thank you, Carmen for sharing these wonderfully inspiring stories."
4,Donna has done it again!,"Love this CD, one of the best dance singles Donna has put on the market! The new CD has 6 remixes with a more European, almost techno kind of sound. Giorgio Moroder did a great job going back to the studio and re-remixing this single. More dance-oriented than the first single, my favorite is #4: 12"" Defenitive Mix, where melody, beat and vocals come together in a ""get on the dance floor and shake your thing"" kind of mix. If you like Donna Summer, you'll love this single!"
5,Thoghrough and Lively,"Not challenging to read at all. Full of very informative and enlightening historical information in a lively context. Complete with references, accurate datings, the stories and challenges of the very first anabaptists and through the 20th century, how the church(es) have grown, political situations and MORE!You can appreciate the work put into this."
4,"Shares others' stories, makes you feel like you're not alone","Informative, helped me understand what the touretter is feeling. (I am the parent). I understood that my son was not alone in some of the ways he feels on and off the medications."
5,This book haunted me long after I finished the last chapter!,"This book almost got me in trouble at my job when I read it because I could not put it down! The intensity of this tale really sticks with the reader. Imagine my surprise when I read the author's biography to find that it was written by none other than my favorite college English professor, the man who taught me that the written word can take one's imagination anywhere it wants to go! Way to go, Dr. Strickland! Do it again!"
4,"whiskey and wine, I'm serving my time",Pleasant to see it rereleased. The Ball bros. deserved more airtime than they got (0). Heavy metal. Ball also played with Procol Harum. Whiskey and Wine is my fav cut.
2,The Natural History of a Wimp,"Uncas Metcalfe, professor of botany, lives in the shelter of his mind's hot house, not the real world. He wilts in the face of every challenge. Nothing much in his life comes to bloom, much less fruition. He even wimps out at the book's very end. His unnatural history isn't worth reading."
3,It's a OK book,"I bought this book because I needed a book of Christmas design, and I thought it would be perfect companion book to go with Sam Hawkins' ""501 Cross Stitch Designs,"" a book that I love. And while this book has a lot of good designs, the patterns are done in color, not black & white symbols, which makes it harder to copy and enlarge for stitch work--I'm one of those who use a copy and a highlighter to mark off what I've done. I also wish that the book were divided into sections for easy reference."
3,I give it 3.5 stars,"Unlike most books, ""Brief Gaudy Hour"" actually improves as it goes along, instead of the other way around. I am sort of obsessed with all things Anne Boleyn, and have read many books about her and about the Tudors. This book starts off kind of slow. For me, I thought the characters were all written a bit one-dimensional and flat, especially Anne, until about two-thirds through the book. However, by the time Anne agrees to be Henry VIII's unofficial mistress at court, things start to pick up. I enjoyed this take on the famous true story, which does a good job of portraying Anne as an innocent young woman who becomes more vindictive as time goes on. I recommend this book to people who enjoy historical fiction, but assure you that there are better Boleyn novels out there."
5,Anne Boleyn's finest,Anne Boleyn is supposedly in my family tree and I was very much interested in yet another take on her life story. Can't wait to dig a little deeper.
4,This is a page turner..I finished it so quick I was mad!,I loved this book so much I can't wait to read it again in a year or two LOL I read both fiction and researched books on Anne Bolelyn..all interesting and entertaining!
4,fabulous,great read by a great author - wish that Campbell-Barnes wrote more during her short writing career!- book in great condition
5,Great stout!,"This is so good, Surprisingly good, and it gets even better with age. I added the whole package of sugar into the brew with the dry malt ""Oops,I didn't read all instructions"", The instruction recommended 300g and I used 1kg, But it turned out awesome, just more alcohol.So far this is my 4th brew, and I have been very happy with all Coopers products."
3,A decent book but not Asimov quality,"The story was very interesting and the author shows a great deal of promise. However, I don't feel that the story fit the Foundation series well."
2,mountain out of a molehill,"In and of itself, the book was enjoyable. As an entry in the Foundation saga however, it was a let down. I suppose Asimov didn't leave Benford a lot to work with. Confined as Benford was to this chapter in the life of Hari Seldon, the contribution was mostly filler, not to mention eerily autobiographical. It was hard to become involved with the story because it seemed as if Benford was drawing from his own personal experiences at some points and then mixing in some Indiana Jones at other points. Interrupt this regularly with background info (Joan and Voltaire), end result: soap opera. Once again, apart from the striking incongruity, this was a good book. For Benford to turn this tiny part of the story into page-turning entertainment is a testament to his ability."
2,"Well, it's different...","I think that Benford has actually done a good job with this novel - it is well written, if not in the style of the other Foundation books. I was rather surprised to find some important aspects of the Foundation universe and its inhabitants changed - the replacement of the hyperspace Jump with wormholes, Trantor's social structure, and the character of Seldon. One thing that particularly annoyed me was Seldon's psychohistorical conclusions about societies and governments: Benford is using Seldon to push his own political views. And why on earth call Seldon a ""mathist"" rather than a ""mathematician"", especially given that Asimov always used the normal word? In general, the book is readable, but it is clearly a Benford book in the Asimov universe."
2,This is not Foundation,"As an avid Asimov and Foundation reader, one thing I can say is that this book only pays a passing tribute to the Foundation universe of Asimov. Apart from some of the characters having the same names, such as Seldon, Dors etc., they are ""different"" characters in that they do not act or behave the same way as in Asimov's novels.The story is uninteresting and the new ""concepts"" introduced into the universe, such as worm holes, TikTocs etc., seem very much out of place.Readers of the Foundation series will still want to finish this book to continue exploring the remaining two novels but be prepared for a hard slog through a relatively uninteresting novel."
2,Boring!,"I'm sure glad I got this book at the library instead of paying money for it. The characters are one-dimentional, and too much time is wasted on pointless dialogue and lenthy descriptions, as well as pointless details. The end gets confusing. The worst part are the 'sims' of Voltairre and Joan of Arc, they just stand around debating philosophy which is not even interesting. No, wait, actually the worst part is that this book has the word Foundation in it, I bet Asimov would be rolling in his grave."
2,"Not bad, but not great","I never really expected this to be that in similar style to Asimov, and wasn't disapointed when it wasn't. My main qualm is that the plot simply wasn't put together in a concise way, it nearly seemed as if the writer was being paid per word that he wrote in the book that i am reviewing right now."
1,Boring and not thought through,"I would suggest avoiding this book unlesss you can borrow it from a library. It's certainly not worth the cover price. It spends far too much time on incidental events such as simulated personalities which have little relevance to the rest of the plot. I can only assume GB was being paid by the word. It's also full of inconsistencies from Asimov's originals, eg wormholes. Also inconsistencies within the story, for instance Asimov had Daneel ""adjust"" Hari so he couldn't reveal his nature. GB has Daneel say he can't adjust Hari because he didn't have a particular brain disease as a child. But then he as Hari mull over the fact that he couldn't tell anyone about Daneel and Dors even if he wanted to because he had been adjusted. OopsAll in all one to avoid Neill"
1,Can't think of much good to say about this book...,"Asimov must be rolling in his grave. Unlike Asimov's creations, this book barely has a plot and drones on forever. I'm not sure why the author thinks devoting a third of the book to some simulations of Voltaire and Joan of Arc having a discourse would be worth reading, but the whole novel falls flat. Skip this one, or better yet, run away...."
5,A MATURE NOVEL--AND IT SET UP THE WHOLE TRILOGY,"It's now obvious from reading the Bear & Brin that Benford designed the arc of the series, and the surprises that come later he planned--particularly the dark past of the mon-robot problem. That's foresight! I recommend all 3 novels--but they require thought! Benford's the best novelist of them, and he thinks more deeply, too."
2,Sigh - was this prequel needed?,"Just having Foundation in the title can send chills down my spine in anticipation. Unfortunately, Benford seems constrained when writing in Asimov's universe. His strengths are when he moves away from the Trantor created universe. His weaknesses are trying to work with The Empire. Sometimes I enjoy Benford's hard science -- but in a Foundation novel? It just doesn't work, and isn't comfortable to read. Thank goodness the reviews for the next 2 prequels are much stronger -- its the only thing motivating me to continue this series..."
1,Boring Boring Boring,"I read close to a book a day and read many good book and many bad books. In my estimation, Benford is a fine author with many fine books written. However, this is not one of them. As a fan of Asimov, I am quite familiar with the Foundation universe. Sadly, this book takes that universe and rips it to shreds. Benford's Voltaire and Joan subplots were contrived and did not fit into the story. One thinks that Benford, in his bid to stretch literary boundaries, crossed a line that should never have been crossed. In all, I was totally disappointed with this novel."
1,A waste of paper. An excuse for cyber-babble at its worst.,"What a complete disappointment. Instead of a true expansion of Asimov's Foundation universe, Benford gives us a token amount of Hari Seldon while going off the deep end into Imperial yuppies playing sex, drug and power games. Even worse, the yuppies are only a mechanism to introduce us to 20,000 year old cyber recreations of Voltair and Joan of Arc, who seem to be in some kind of menage a trois with a robot waiter that has a crush on a blonde cook. And somewhere in this mess he drags in giant worms ala Dune. I had to give up after wading through the first third, which is almos unheard of for me."
2,Highly NOT recomended,"Even though Mr. Benford tried to shred a new light to birth of Foundation, his efforts are useless. Boring dialogs, a lot of fantasy, a lot of empty words... The plot is ""watered"" with unecessary descriptions, long dialogs that lead nowhere (the begining is not to bad but it gets worse reading to the end).Good highlight is Eto Demerzel's character - his comeback. The writing style is quite acceptable."
2,Just read so you can say you did,"Before reading this entry into the foundation universe, i had just finished reading ""Forward the Foundation"" and ""Prelude to the Foundation"" and found the very different writing styles to be a shock. It was hard for me to plod through the unnecessary converstaion and flat characters of the story.It is also possible that the story was that much worse because it described a piece of the foundation story I had just finished reading, eventhough it was more in depth. Whatever the reason I finished reading it because I had already bought the other two installments and I did not want to miss anything. The book did contain a couple of parts that were very interesting save for tedious description and dialogue."
2,I was disappointed...,"Benford is a good author but sadly his addition to the Foundation Saga did not fit at all. First, the personalities are way too different than in the original series. Secondly, the story contradicts way too many of the things set forth by Asimov such as the non-existance of aliens. Finally, some events are unbelievable such as Superhero Seldon performing feats even James Bond wouldn't attempt.Benford took his previous writings (Immersion, etc.) and simply 'meshed' them into the book, put in the characters, and called it ""Foundation"". Had he written outside of Asimov's universe, the book would have been much better."
2,Storyline unrelated to foundation series,"I've read the original series over several times, both in timeline and published sequence and I found myself asking the question 'What has this story got to do with the whole thing?'. For large portions of the book, it seemed like the author had a completely different story for a completely different book and was trying to shoehorn it into the foundation series - particularly the large part dedicated to Joan of Arc and Voltaire and also the alien intelligences. I found I was reading it not because I liked what was going on, but because I felt compelled to finish something I had started. I had a similar feeling about much of the 'Foundations Friends' book some time ago."
2,A very tedious book to read. Asimov fans beware!,"This novel was very tedious to read. Being a fan of clearly written fiction, especially Asimov, I found Benford's storytelling very plodding. I could only read it in small, single-chapter snippets, unlike any Asimov book, which I could easily read in one sitting. The introduction of ""sims"" defied logic. Having a sim act as first minister dumbfounded me. The scenes and references to Panucopia were very distracting. Seldon kept seeing parallels between the Pans and Humans, yet it was unclear whether this formed some basis for Psychohistory. Also the use of the word ""mathist"" and other non-Asimov language was very distracting. I wish Benford had included his afterword as a warning to Asimov fans contemplating the reading of this book."
2,"After 100 pages , I had to put it down. Sorry!",I've never read Gregory Benford's books. I expected this book to be written in the style that Asimov would have written it. Asimov's writing style is what appealed to me I guess and I hoped to just have it continue.
2,Not Asimov.,"This is a really nice book. But it's not Asimov! Benford's writing is nice, and some idea's are revolutionary (like the reason why humans are the only intelligent race in the galaxy). But on the other hand, there are some ideas that just don't fit for Asimov's universe (like wormholes). True, even Asimov had some contradictions, like said in Benford's Afterward. But they still fit. In conclution, This book is nice and you should read it, and even only to understand ""F&Chaos"", which should be great. But you mustn't think of it as an Asimov story. Read it, but beware."
2,Disappointing - skip to the 2nd book of the trilogy.,"Foundation's Fear is very disappointing. Gregory Benford takes it upon himself to change the physics of Asimov's universe. The book would have been much better if the middle 300 pages had been left out. On a happier note, Foundation and Chaos by Greg Bear is much better."
1,"If you loved Asimov's series, skip this one.","I read the numerous reviews and almost didn't purchase this one because of the many negative comments. Being a HUGE fan of Asimov's series, though, I felt I had to give it a try. I regret that decision. This book was nothing like the original series and added nothing to it. If you read Asimov's last book, Forward the Foundation, this one is just a copy with a lot of unnecessary detail included (over 500 pages). You won't miss anything by skipping this one.If you are a fan of Benford and thought Asimov omitted a lot, then maybe you'll like this one. Maybe it was just over my head, but I loved Asmimov's books and this one wasn't necessary."
1,"...Not a ""Foundation Book""","I found this book qiute tedious to read. It lacks the fluidity that makes Asimov a literary great. Also, I don't like the way that Benford changed the ""Foundation"" universe, the worst examples being ""worm-holes"" and alien intelligences. Asimov explains this lack of alien civilizations in ""The End Of Eternity"". Overall, I found this to be one of the worst books I ever read!"
1,Didn't Asimov already write this one?,"Just from reading the reviews, I can see what is in the book that is ""Foundational"" simply rehashes, storyline-wise, the two pre-foundation books Asimov wrote. No. Hari is dead, both of them. Let them rest in peace."
1,Major letdown,"Normally I check out other Amazon.com reader's comments on novels that I intend to buy, before I actually buy. I bought this book without doing so because it was ""approved by the Asimov Trust"". What a major mistake! A ""Voltaire & Joan D'Arc"" tangent filled half the book, and contributed nothing to the main storyline. I think the author found sudden fascination with the concept of bodyless simulated ""souls"" and just happened to be writing this book at the time. So he went ahead and ""core dumped"". The book does, however, in the tradition of the other Foundation books, make comments on *current* social mores and on the ""decline"" of the physical science research (in conjunction with the ascendancy of the engineering disciplines)."
5,Expertly written addition to Foundation lore,"I was worried as I started this book, having read all of the Foundation and Robot novels in the past. As I began this journey into Seldon's Trantor, I reveled in the marvelous manner that Benford described the moods and the feel of this world and time. I loved the Joan and Voltaire sections and the dialogue that ensued, as well as the Pan adventure and conclusions drawn from this. I can't wait to start the next book and wait (hopefully not long) for the third !!"
2,"OK, but not great",I expected the 2nd foundation series to pickup where the foundation series left off not backtrack & cover stuff not written about in the past. There is a large section is regarding the SIMs could have been shortened down considerably. I skimmed a lot of the information. A lot of the technology in the book is not mentioned in any of the org books and seems out of place for the timeframe. It seems more star trekish than foundation series.
1,BORING!!!,"This is easily one of the most boring SF books I've read. Don't expect an Asimov-like story. It is not. Benford doesn't come close to the clear, understandable and entertaining way Asimov wrote. Even if you judge it on it's own, it is still boring. Read it only if you are a true fan of foundation and would like to read the other 2 books in this series."
1,The only interesting part is it's title - Foundation,"This book could be interesting only to those who read other Foundation novels - without Asimov's original series, this one would be complete waste of time. It is full of pointless explanations and dialogues which make you skip chapters, not pages. Really uncomparable to Asimov's books, this doesn't deserve to be part of the Foundation series..."
1,Just Plain Bad,"Other reviewers have more than amply pointed out that this book utterly lacks Asimov's style, and the familiar characters have changed (brief examples: despite numerous attacks, not one mention of Seldon's twisting; only one line regarding Seldon's adopted son Ryach; and most upsetting, the utter lack of connection and sympathy we feel for Daneel, who has become a weary -- and wearying -- collection of stock phrases and contradictions).Most awful is that this book suffers from lack of a good editor. Hundreds of pages of the dialog between the computer simulated characters Joan of Arc and Voltair should have been cut, and that's just a start. The book is filled with future techno babble which is neither engaging or germain to the story.In short, don't read this expecting to be re-engaged in Seldon's world. And if your time is limited, don't bother reading it at all."
1,Why is Benford an author?,"After mangling the sequel to Arthur C. Clarke's great novel ""Against the Fall of Night"" Benford is back to ruin yet another great science fiction classic, this time by writing what is supposed to be a sequel to Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy. As is usual for Benford, this is a nearly unreadable mess.In the two sequels to this Benford novel, Greg Bear and David Brin do a respectable job trying to repair the damage that Benford does to the ""Foundation"" universe, while still maintaining some semblance of continuity with Benford's nonsensical mishmash. But it plainly would have been better if Benford had simply not participated in this project at all.Not recommended."
1,The other two books are much better,"I completely agree with the other reviewers. This book was awful (and I'm a diehard Asimov universe fan - I read all 6 of those mediocre Robot City books). Its important for anyone reading these reviews to be aware that the two books that follow this one in the series (by Bear and Brin) are much much better. Unfortunately they had to start where Benford left off, but given that handicap, I think they did a really good job, particularly the second book."
1,I stopped at the mid-point,"I began the book primarily because of the Foundation aspect (as did most other readers). I was hoping for a story picking up where ""Foundation & Earth"" left off. No such luck. I was very disappointed to find that the new trilogy was going to ""fill in the gaps"" of a time period already covered by Asimov in the last two official Foundation novels (""Prelude"" and ""Forward"").The first hundred pages kept me pretty interested but eventually my eyes started to glaze. I slogged on till the mid-point, but after a few days I realized I had no desire to return to the book. That's when I decided to quit.I would have forced myself if I weren't already disappointed with the premise, but I read nothing here to indicate that this particular experiment will provide any indispensible lore to the Foundation universe.I have not read any other Benford novels, so I can't comment on whether this novel was a reflection of his usual work."
2,tedious at best,"Like most other reviewers, I found this book to be quite tedious and difficult to get through. The Joan/Voltaire stuff seemed out of place and distracting (and long!) while the various assassination attempts, Seldon's dislike of the premiereship and other political events seemed to lack all logic. All that aside however, I have to wonder mainly about the editor(s) of this series. Right off the bat, you are treated to a mis-spelling of Dors Venabili as ""Vanabili"" - not once, but several times. I have to wonder if the author himself has read the original Foundation novels...! It would explain a lot."
1,"Big Science, Small Conflict","Maybe if the first half of this treatise had been lopped off, the story could have been salvaged. As it is, one slogs through 600 agonizing pages of pseudo-science with little conflict and no suspense. Benford should have written a concordance to Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, then he wouldn't have had this weak story getting in the way of his speculation."
2,A tough read and Asimov wouldn't have written it.,"Isaac Asimov would not have had to explain Hari Seldon or Dors Venabali, his text would have done that for him. This was not an easy read. I have enjoyed Isaac Asimov's writings for many years having been initiated by my father who took up reading Asimov's works from the 1940'S. My first book was ""Foundation and Earth"" and from there was addicted. These books made sense as Isaac Asimov wrote with easy prose, not he said, she said, they did. Books that were written, using Asimov's name after his death, are mere stories by amateurish wannabes. Regretfully, no one can imitate his style and description."
2,Foundation's Fear is this Asimov fan's biggest fear!,"One of the things that I have always enjoyed about the Foundation series is Mr. Asimov's easy writing style. Unfortunately, I found that reading Foundation's Fear was a laborious exercise. The author seems to struggle reconciling the scientific concepts initialized by Isaac Asimov with his own concepts of physics. The entire dialogue between Voltaire and Joan was particularly difficult to wade through, only to discover that this part of the story line had very little to do with the development of the rest of the book. I understand that some ideas had to be set up for the next two books, but I was frustrated by the sense that this book just didn't have a reason for being other than the commercial success guaranteed by the ""Foundation"" title. Given a choice between buying this book or rereading any of the original Foundation titles, this reviewer would recommend revisiting Mr. Asimov's authentic classics."
2,"Not Asimov, nor Foundation, nor good Benford, not good atall","I don't like trashing honest efforts, and I guess this was an honest effort by Gregory Benford, but it fails inexorably.It's supposed to take off from PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION, and does include the two principals from that book, Hari & Dors, also Yugo who's much less interesting than he was in the first book. I especially wonder what happened to Raich who Hari & Dors seemed to be taking in as a son.It is much too heavily laden down with technical talk. There's precious little action on any level for much of the book. Therefore, reading it does become a bit of a chore, not the fun it was reading Asimov's stories.You'll probably want to read it as preparation for the other two books, so just be prepared not to be very excited by it."
2,Tedious...,"This book kicks off the Second Foundation trilogy--and makes rather a mess of things. Oh, some parts have virtues. The early history of Hari and Dors, for instance. But it is overlong, badly in need of editing, and thoroughly tedious in parts. The Voltaire/Jeanne d'Arc subplots are both overdone and underdone---too much focus is given to them, and the details are not interesting. THe next book in the series, Foundation and Chaos, is far better."
1,Rehashed Material,"I am very disappointed in Gregory Benford. If he wasn't up to the task of writing a Foundation Novel, then he should have passed the opportunity to do so.Instead, more than half of this novel is previously published material. The Joan and Voltaire material is lifted from a novella he wrote for Robert Silverberg's Time Gate shared world, and the Chimpanzee Immersion material is lifted from a short story he wrote in 1996 called ""Immersion.""The rest of the novel is, in my opinion, mainly poor characterization of Asimov's characters, acting in ways that would cause the Good Doctor to spin in his grave.I really like Benford's work...but this is certainly the worst effort he has ever put to paper. The fact that much of the book is lifted material (even if it is fairly good material) is inexcusable. The material does not even mesh well with the rest of the book, much less the Foundation Universe."
1,Benford just uses his ideas and puts them on Asimov's Found.,"I just couldn't finish the book, it's really boring. Many of the ideas Benford writes about (IE: The ""sims"", the ""mesh"") were already used in other novels he did.Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the characters aren't themselves anymore! Particulary astonishing is Yugo's change. In this book he is some kind of patriotic Dahlite. Asimov's Yugo never cared about politics.My advice is skip this book, it's not worth it."
2,Fear of Foundation's Fear,"I feel it my duty to discredit this installment of Asimov's wonderful Foundation series. To me, this book wandered way too far into an abstract type of Science fiction that I feel Asimov never delved into. I also feel that Asimov's characters (Seldon, Amarov, etc.) were fundamentally changed. Yugo Amarov was made into a eclectic people-person, when Asimov portrayed him as a reclusive, obsessive psychohistorian. I did not enjoy this book. But Bear's Foundation and Chaos redeems the series."
1,I should have read the reviews,"I was very disappointed in this book, as it turns out, for all of the reasons mentioned in existing reviews. I got bogged down in the whole Voltaire/Joan of Arc thing and ran out of interest. I've read some other reviews that suggest just paging past that part. I may try that when I have time, since my money is already sunk. Asimov this ain't."
3,The weakest in the series,"I recently finished the series. This was certainly the weakest of the three books. While the story line was interesting, the author was far to explanatory and the long and frequent musings of Voltaire and Joan were work to finish. Nothing that a better editor wouldn't have corrected. If you are not a huge Asimov fan, consider starting with the last book in the series Foundations Triumph."
2,Not Asimov. but A good Modern SF story,"I can't beleive Mrs. Asimov approved this story. It's not at all connected to Asimov's stories, themes, or style of writing. Once accepted it's not related to Asimov, and taken as something seperate then it's a good story. It's a good modern SF novel."
2,Old Model is Better,"I bought this griddle after borrowing my friend's Cuisinart double burner griddle in April. I liked that griddle so much that I tried to get one for myself. Unfortunately, I could not find the older model anywhere so I bought this one. This current model just doesn't seem as sturdy as the original nor of the same quality. I'm disappointed."
1,Be aware!!!!!,"After three days of ligth use, following the instructions given, it distort!!! Don?t buy this thing!!!!"
4,Awesome Cookware!,"If you want the best, get this. It's durable and great for large families.It has even heating and the non-stick surface is great."
5,"Expensive, but well worth the price!!","As source material for the bioethics student, this anthology is a joy to read and refer back to. After a laconic introduction by Helga Kuhse, the book begins to situate bioethics as a discipline with articles contrasting it to law, ethics, and religion. The diverse approaches are next examined, each by an expert (Arras on the case approach, Childress on the prnciple approach, etc). Especially informative and provocative are the articles on personhood by Michael Tooley and brain death by Jeff McMahan. A sanity check is provided for bioethics teachers who wonder if they are approaching the discipline correctly in the critical review on how bioethics is taught by Catherine Myser. The book is a gold mine by experts who dispassionately present their topics cogently and clearly."
2,bioethics,"decent read for class. almost too much material, but efficient in explaining details of bioethics"
4,Chatback Interviews (Import),"It all started when I went to a media place in Appleton where they sell imports and other cds of all different artists. My favorite artist being Marilyn Manson I automatically went to this section and found numerous titles by him. Out of all of them, most of which I had, I noticed the Chatback Interviews CD and decided to buy it. When I got home I ripped open the packaging and put it into my cd player.This cd is a very good oppertunity to find out what is underneath the music and get inside what Marilyn Manson stands for and what he has done, and doing, with his life. It is very informative and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the man and his music. This is not just for the die hard fan, it is also for the critics who do not understand and judge the man for his look and not his inner being. I would recommend this cd to anyone who wants to know a little bit more or those who want to learn something new about this extroidinary artist and person."
1,CHEAT,"The people who sells this product are cheaters, because i bought this product and they sent me another cd from marilyn manson that i didn't orther, this interview of marilyn manson, they don't own it, they just cheat you about it. If this product doesn't exist, they should not put it for sale, i don`t know how amazon borrow his name for those people that try to sell something that they dont have."
4,Surprisingly nice,"I bought this ottoman because I needed one, and I'm desperately short of storage space in my studio apartment. First of all, the unit looks nice (which wasn't really important since I'm using it under my desk). If people come over, I have no problem with pulling it out to give someone another place to sit. It's at the right height to put my feet on. The storage itself is nice; one really great feature is that the lid stays open by itself, even if you only open it part way. This was an unexpected bonus for me because there isn't enough room under my desk to open it all the way.If I was going to complain, I'd say that because it doesn't have any compartments, it's harder to store things in there; you can just throw stuff in, but you won't be able to organize anything. It's also large to be used under a desk, but I knew that before buying it. I've been able to make that part work.In short, I like it, and recommend it."
1,just awful,"very little of this book is devoted to a factual review of the disaster the author believes occurred 12,000 years ago..what he goes over is almost entirely myth - and his own musings..don't waste your money on this book!!"
3,The Very Berst of The Southerland Brothers and Quiver,"Not the best of their work, but no one should be without ""Arms of Mary"", one of the great post Beatles tunes."
5,Absolutely one of the finest prog records ever made.,If you like fine progressive rock. Try VDGG. Hammill is one of the most expressive voices around. not to mention the rest of the group's instrumental brilliance.
3,Worthy Progressive rock suffers from mild operatic delusions,"3 1/2With shades of epic-ness, this lyrically heavy-handed, pretentiously sung work often feels a little more sluggish then it ought. There remains enough melodic assertion however, (in better moments reminiscent of the compositional keyboardist complexities found in Gentle Giant, but usually ending up sounding more like the rustic rust of Jethro Tull) to elevate a few of these older and aggressive progressive rock slugouts into a memorable light."
2,"Close, but no cigar...","I'm kind of torn on this album. It has moments of sheer brillance and greatness, but in large part epitomizes why progressive rock faded from favor. It forgets that music ultimately needs to be musical - a simple rule, but one that this album frequently forgets then remembers which makes this album a somewhat frustrating listening experience (this is a rule that the mighty Yes frequently breaks as well). Flighty lyrics thrown over multi-instrument riffs doesn't necessarily make music. If you want to hear a more ""musical"" progressive rock album, try Transatlantic's SMPTe. Also, if you want to hear what a Hammond organ is capable of, buy an ELP album, or better yet, see Keith Emerson live in concert. This album will stay in the collection to see if it improves with continued listening, but it doesn't get any more stars."
5,A good Low cost cell phone service - we used for many years,A good low cost cell phone service plan.I have not see anyone else can offer better deal than STI. If you fond others please share.Yes there is a daily charge but if you read their website it is clearly listed. And looking it from a monthly base. It is about 3 ~ 4 dollar per month you cannot get better deal than this.If you are not a heavy user but still need a cell phone with you. This is very good choice.A happy customer for 5 years+
4,Enjoyable Read,"A sad ending to Mary Stuart's tales of Arthur and Camelot. This book back-tracks a bit from where the trilogy ends, starting with Mordred as a young boy first being introduced into Morgause's palace and web of intrigue.A very pleasant book to read, the author has a very nice way of setting a scene and bringing the reader into it. I would have enjoyed this more if I hadn't so recently read another tale on Arthur,Queen of Camelot. I came across many instances where the books were telling the same story and found myself skipping through those sections."
3,A Depressing Sequal to the Trilogy,"I enjoyed Mary Stewart's Arthur trilogy and naturally purchased The Wicked Day. The book builds on a few of the key characters from the Trilogy (excluding Merlin) and is as well written; however, the plot will leave those who enjoyed the optimism and sense of purpose of the first books wanting.Unlike the previous works in which Merlin guides the young Arthur to his destiny of becoming King of a unified Britain, the Wicked Day follows the life of Mordred, the ill-conceived son of Arthur. The divinely inspired guidance of Merlin in the Trilogy is replaced by the evil plotting of Morgause, and the hopefulness of the earlier works, as Arthur rises to power, is replaced by an impending sense of doom for the hapless Mordred. Readers who enjoy an escape into a world of progress, in which good triumphs over evil should pass over the Wicked Day."
4,Imaginative biography of King Arthur's nemesis,"Mary Stewart completes her series of books on the King Arthur legend with this life-story of the knight who killed him, his son Mordred. She convincingly creates a redeeming psychological profile of the killer, rather than letting him be a cardboard villain. The tale also features portraits of Mordred's half-brothers, Gawain, Gareth, Agravaine, and Gaheris. As always, Stewart excels at exposition, with absorbing details of the medieval British countryside and daily life"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The fourth book in Mary Stewart's Arthurian saga, with a difference.This book is not about Merlin, but about Mordred. The boy is lied toand manipulated by an over-ambitious mother.This will end in war and bloodshed, and Merlin is no longer around to try and prevent everything tumbling down."
2,Book review,"I think Mary Steward lost her way with this book, it really fails miserably to wrap things up from the earlier and excellent Merlin books."
4,Mary Stewart Arthurian series,I generally like this author and I am a King Arthur fan. This series is written through Merlin's eyes. I have not yet read this final book in the series. Some of her ideas on the Arthurian legend are a bit different than the traditional ideas and in places she gets a bit long-winded. But overall I liked the series.
5,Jungian Student,"This book was a catalyst in my development as an individual at 17 years of age. To this day many years later, it has provided me with so much insight about myself and humanity. The realizations of self ultimately give an understanding of others and their tribulations.I have purchased another copy (because mine was not returned by friends twice) and a Carl Jung ""action figure"" for my five-year-old son. While I understand he will not be able to read and comprehend it now, I know it will provide a great outline regarding the inner world that so many are lacking in this day and age.For anyone who is cerebral, this book stands the test of time. The concepts and images will make a direct correlation with your personal life."
4,Experience it.,"There are hundreds of images in this book. I appreciate that the author doesnt just talk about the images, but allows you to experience them as he discusses them. While this is a scholarly discussion the images allow you to react emotionally to the content as well as intellectually to the words."
4,Mind opening read,"This is a fascinating book, not just in that it tries to explain the workings of the mind and what seems to be encoded symbolism within it, but also that it was written at a time when the new quantum physics was breaching into the public domain. It was interesting to read some of the authors trying integrate this into their model of the mind.The work is somewhat dated (published in 1964) in that none of the latest findings in neurobiochemistry and structural neurology are discussed. I found the chapter on symbolism in the visual arts by Jaffe stretched its arguments a bit too thin for my liking, but was captivated by Jacobi's chapter which describes an analysis.This is a very good primer to Jung and a worthwile read."
2,"why in depth,when the basics aren't clear","the first part of the book(jung's part)is really nice explained of what psychology actually is(but it's only 72 pages).and then very surprising ,the other authers start explaining in depth fragments of importent parts of psychology with examples!!!I didn't like that approach.I had a feeling their was much more to say about it in general.it's more like ""a built yourself machine"" where every part of the machine is named ,but how you put it together is your problem.Sooo after a while the book became really anoying.Hope this helps"
2,Surprisingly uninteresting.,"I purchased this in a batch of books which I had wanted to read for a while, including Richard Dawkin's The Selfish Gene.To be honest, this book is quite a disappointment to me. As noted in other reviews, Jung actually wrote only 1/5th of this book, serving as editor for the rest of the pieces. And it is exactly Jung's own writing which I find disappointing.Jung's style is sloppy and unfocussed, possibly because this is evidently the first time he writes 'for the layman'. Compared to Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, which I read alternatingly with this book, Man and his Symbols reads like a sloppy collection of personal opinion. It's hard to see from this introduction how Jung is considered to be such an important thinker."
2,How about a quality book?,"The content is classic and deserves better quality presentation. How about a hardcover? The paper is cheap and already turning brown. The print is miniscule and could be a font size or two larger. I want to buy books to continue building a quality library, not a cheap throw-away."
5,Perfectly imperfect,I ordered this used and got exactly what I expected. I'm completely pleased. It's worth the savings to have the txt be highlighted and written in. I'm TOTALLY good with it.
5,A step closer to understanding,"I had purchased Man and His Symbols for a dream analysis class I took last Spring, and without a doubt it was the most helpful piece of reading required for the course. This book was written for the common man to read and understand, and I believe everyone should read this. The insight this book offers is beyond our Western culture; this book stands as a set of guidelines one can take toward a life of enlightenment and meaning."
5,An amazing book,"Jung is one of my favorite authors. I always find his works outstanding. the book talks about mythology and the role symbols play in people's lives. Jung also touches on the topic of the unconsious and how one's unawareness of one's symbolic nature gives power to the shadow within.There is also a section about the symbols in dreams and how the subconsious plays in disguising the themes that are prevailing in our lives in dreams as ordinary or bizarre situations. I definitely recommend this book to everyone who want to learn about symbolism, subconsious and is also fascinated by good style and expression. As non-native speaker I can say that the book is not very easy to read for people whose mother language is not English, but I think it is worth the effort especially if it is not translated in your own language. I defintely recommend this book."
5,Excellent condition that matches the seller's description,This book arrived well within the alloted time frame. I got busy and just checked emails logs to see what I've missed. It arrived as expected and along side it's paperback copy that I own I can now appreciate the hardbound version with a much richer experience.Thanks.- Marc
4,Not as easy a read as promised...,"Jung's concepts interested me so I purchased this book. I am far from educated in psychology, but I am intrigued by it. Although advertised as a book for the layman, I would disagree. Not simple enough to help build the foundation upon which I would like to build. Better as a third or fourth book after a base of knowledge has been laid."
4,A fun game with honest friends,"Kokology intrigued me as a game because I love personality tests and I love to do them in groups. It's very fun to play with a group of honest friends who are willing to admit their flaws and pride, and although sometimes it's deadly accurate, sometimes it's totally off the mark. Unfortunately, Kokology /feels/ like pop psychology -- more than a little off base at times; and you can't count on it for accurate results. Nevertheless, we've had some great laughs with this game, and I think that in the right cultural context (we're a kooky bunch), this could be a most excellent party game. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys being surprised by the results of a self-test."
4,A lot of insightful fun!,"This is such a cool method, whether you do it on your self, with a friend, or with a group. It's psychology game designed to tell you a lot about yourself or the other person. And it's a lot of fun. You basically read a short story, and then answer some simple questions, like what the symbolism in the story means to you, what order you would do the tasks in, what colours you see the things as, who the voices you hear are, etc. Then, you read what your answers represent about yourself. The accuracy is simply amazing, this is obviously very well researched."
2,Wears off pretty fast,"The book has several sets of questions which supposedly elicit your deep thoughts and attitudes, but the sets are all very similar, just different in details. So, after playing three or four sets, it gets repetitive and boring. You learn nothing more new about yourself. If you already have experienced such question games at parties etc, you might find you already know everything you hoped to learn by doing this book's exercises. For a first-timer, the book will hold some attraction for a few pages, but the excitement wears off QUICKLY."
4,excellent !,i havent been able to put this book down since a relative introduced it to me. i even took it to work. im such a big fan of it . its quite possibly one of the most enjoyable books ive ever come across. kudos to the writers !join my online kokology discussion forumhttp://groups.myspace.com/kokology( must be a myspace.com member to participate )
2,??What??,"Confused about this book , not quite sure how to use it still figuring it out this is more of a chinise type practice thought it would just be quizzes, but its ok well learn an hopefully dicover more of myself form it ."
3,Fun-ish,"This is a fairly decent book. It contains lots of little one or two page situational stories and asks the reader(s) a number of questions in response. -- It is mildly entertaining and harmless enough, but not nearly as much fun as any of the quizes in Cosmopolitan magazine. Nothing earth shattering is revealed in the book, but it is almost a solid three stars. -- If you are a real coupon clipper pass on this one, but if you want to give yourself a facial one night and have something lighthearted to do while you wait to rinse it off."
3,Les is more,"3 1/2Cool alternative to their studio debut, this nine song live set highlighted the band's eccentric appeal and notable chemistry (LaLonde and Alexander being one of the few guitar and drum sections able to compliment Claypool's one of a kind technique), apparently only two months into it's current incarnation nonetheless."
3,A curio for the fans of this bass heavy band,"Primus seems to split so many opinions.My own is that this is a weird recording by a bunch of guys who are seriously into what they are doing. How many other bands could put out stuff like John the Fisherman and Groundhog Day. This is great stuff in terms of being challenging listening, it certainly won't ever make an appearance on an easy listening station!Bass heavy as you would expect - though the drums are also prominent and the production is fine, no problems with the fact that this is a live offering. All Primus fans should buy this, the reason I give it only three stars is that it is hard for the newcomer to get into. Perhaps one of the studio albums would be a better intro to this interesting band. Otherwise you may feel like you've wandered into a party where everyone is talking a different language to you!Certainly different."
3,"only primus album I like, I openly admit i'm NOT a primus fan","I'm not a primus fan obviously, or at least a ""true"" fan by any means. But, I do have a liking for this album. John the Fisherman is my favorite Song on this, and I only like the live version of it on this album. Didn't like it on the other album, frizzle fry I think it was, could be wrong. Vocals are so funny, the minute I turn on the album, I can't but laugh at claypool's vocals. They CAN'T be taken seriously, this band has a big joking manner. But a serious note about the band is the bass playing of Claypool which most people know him by. I give the other members credit too of course, they play good music. Overall, 3 stars for me. Not a primus fanatic."
5,This is a first album??,"The craziest thing about this album is that Les Claypoole had only been playing with the other members, ""Herb"" and Ler for three months when this was recorded. You would have never noticed judging by the great songs. The only things this CD offers that ""Frizzle Fry"" doesn't is ""Tommy the Cat"", ""Jellikit"", and ""The Heckler"". The sound isn't as clean, but you do get a live ""ballroom"" sound. This CD is getting tougher and tougher to find these days. If you're a fan, you better buy it right now!!!"
5,One of the year's best....,"I was expecting a lot out of this CD. On the Jihad EP, OTEP showed amazing potential leading me to the conclusion that they could arrive on the top tier of bands with System of a Down, Tool, Marilyn Manson, etc. The re-workings of the Jihad songs (TRIC,Filthee,Possession,Sacrilege) I personally think are slightly weaker than their original versions. Some have acredited this a new guitarist, Im not sure if thats the case, maybe Otep and the band just decided to see the tracks through a different light, if u would. However, those 4 tracks do get better with repeated listens and all the new tracks are incredible (Blood Pigs,My Confession,Battle Ready, Menocide,etc.) Please do not compare this band to Kittie in anyway, they are a billion times better. OTEP has a lot of potential and should make tremendous noise on Ozzfest with some other great new bands such as Flaw,The Apex Theory, and Lost Prophets."
2,What?,"Okay I don't even own this or heard enough of this but from what I heard this recording is quite poor. Otep are basically a death metal band with a female vocalist. But are they the first to do it? Nope! Another death metal band with a female vocalist is Arch Enemy but unlike this band, Arch Enemy are awesome. While Arch Enemy are basically like In Flames or Dark Tranquillity with a female vocalist, Otep are more like a nu-metal band with a female vocalist. However this vocalist is cr a p! She sounds like she's screaming and then suddenly moaning. The guitars are complete garbage as well, just the same old 3 chords with no solos. I'd give this 2 stars to be forgiving but if you want a real chick metal band then listen to Arch Enemy or Nightwish instead of this mediocre group."
5,Otep is most definitely a Poet.,"I first heard of Otep on the Ozzfest 2001 Summer Sampler. The song was ""T.R.I.C."" and I was amazed. Never have I heard a woman rap and growl so good in one song. I had to hear more. Not too long after, I picked up Sevas Tra, and I was completely blown away. Not only is the music powerful and in-your-face heavy, but Otep's growling, screaming, and from-the-soul singing made it all come together in a way not many bands have been able to achieve. The whole CD flows great, with thrashing rapcore tracks, slow yet pounding songs, and even a spoken poem. Otep is a very good poet and had an obviously extensive knowledge of Egyptian gods and goddesses. This CD is a must for any hardcore or metal listener.Standouts: ""Blood Pig,"" ""Sacrilege,"" and ""Menocide"""
4,A nice creative and innovative change to the metal scence,"After hearing a couple of songs of this album I finally decided to buy this album, and I must say it is not too bad. The contrast of the music is interesting, especially how she goes from satanic demon sounding screams to innocent young woman sounding tones, to hardcore and speedy raps. The music is insane. And the slow poetry songs are quite interesting. The music is also very angry and at times disturbing. Jonestown Tea is a very disturbing song but it tells an interesting story and it's definately a cool song to listen to."
2,heavy but uninteresting,"i bought this CD cuz i heard somebody talking about a woman vocalist with a lot of energy. well i didn't know she was going to be screaming and growling. the guitars are heavy and are sometimes cool but the vocals ruin everything. i am sure you will think this is revolutionary material if you ride the bandwagon and love all the cool heavy bands with a ""new"" sound like SLIPKNOT and MUDVAYNE and CRAPWANNABEBAND. check out something from the early '90s like BOLTTHROWER or DEICIDE and you will find where all these ""nu-metal"" bands get their ideas from. actually FEAR FACTORY - SOUL OF A NEW MACHINE would be the best example."
2,One hit wonder,"Ok, i gotta be honest here. I'm a music snob and i'm old enough and heard enough where i've earned that right. ""Blood Pigs"" is a great song and i was stoked when i heard it. *earned a star*Off to the next song with high expections.... wtf?!? she's..she's RAPPING?!? >_< You've gotta be kidding me. No more stars for you! Sounds like 311(and that IS a insult) with heavier music. geez, what a waste.I haven't heard any of Otep's other cds and i won't be eather. Theres too many good bands out there with badass chick vocals for me to bother. Scarling, Jack Off Jill, My Ruin...etc..."
3,Nu-Metal??!!,"I'm not sure about Otep-I don't think 'original' applies here. Korn came around and set the precedence for this particular sound (maybe not creating it...but definately selling it): the emphasis on heavy breathing, agressive vocals-smoothe vocals, heavy bass-driven, etc. Slipknot took up the slack where Korn left off-increasing the intensity and brutality. To be quite frank, Otep sounds EXACTLY like Slipknot. Granted, they've got a female singer and some 'poetic' lyrics (just as aggressive as the rest- aka. everyone is after me, everyone hates me, everyone lies to me, my life is agony....). Nothing new here- it would be nice if they found their OWN sound. They need to evolve - like Neurosis (out of hardcore-punk) or Godflesh (away from Swans). I recommend this album for individuals who LOVE Slipknot and don't mind knock-offs. Additionally, I recommend this album for anyone under the age of 17."
3,hmmmm....,1 star for the brutal drumming1 star for the insane heavy guitar1 star for the lyrics-2 stars for the horrible female vocalist
1,a BAD album,"""Sevas Tra"" has 1 good song song on it which is bloodpigs. But the rest sounds way to much like rap and leave you wondering how anyone could write something that bad. i have seen other reveiws saying that the band can play well, this is completly false the guitars and bass are boring and the drumming is slow and pathetic"
4,Great,"This is a great CD. Otep Shamaya can scream. And the music in the backround is played very well. I don't care for the lyrics much, but they're good. Otep is similar to Kittie, and i love Kittie. The whole rap thing is eh, okay...I don't know what my favorite song is , cause they're all so good! Overall, you should buy this CD, espically if you like Kittie."
5,"If you like Slipknot, you will love this","The cd is structured almost exactly like Slipknots Iowa. However, while Slipknot convey a pure message of anger in their music, Otep goes through almost every level of personal torture concevable.Otep goes through moments of screaming like a banshee to almost breaking down into tears. No matter what the mood the music is still conveyed with the greatest touches of poetry and detail. On of the best cd's of all time."
2,Low on substance,"Otep is a band that I initially enjoyed due to their flavor...very very heavy music with a ""poet"" singer. However, it grows thin VERY quickly.After Blood Pigs, you will be sorta hardpressed to find a solid metal song. Sacrilege and Battle Ready are the closest you will find to a true metal song, but even they stray in ways where they just become tedious. The last track is not anything I want to hear. Is it even music? I don't think so.The less said about this band the better. They are a flavor of the week deal."
2,What do people see in this?,"I don't understand what all of the fuss is about. I suppose that if you're a KoRn kiddie, this CD is commensurate with the second coming of Christ, but it failed to impress me. The riffs get a C, but the vocals get old after about two or three songs. This is just the latest in the woefully stale nu-metal collective...Save your money."
3,poet???,only like 5 1/2 of the songs are good and most of them can get a little old.......it IS really heavy or REALLY boring/mellow/crappy/bad.......and her 'poet' writing is pretty corny i think..and occasionally the vocals get corny...its just ok.....not for the christian gospel group
2,POET?...HA!....right...........,"attempted female metal rapping = BADdefinetly whiny girly 'metal' voice = BADlaughable lyrics = BADalbum artwork = GOOD (i dont know why but its true)blood pigs, T.R.I.C., Sacrelige, Filthee, part of Emptee = GOODThe rest of the songs = BADsorry, but its true (wait, no, im not sorry)by the way im not tryin' to sound sexist to her (im a girl myself,so there!)but if youre going to be the lead singer to a metal band and be a girl at the same time, at least do it right...THE END.... YOU JUST FILLED WITH KNOWLEDGE, NO?"
1,No thanks.,I'll i can say is bad! BAD BAD BAD!! The instermentals are boring and dry and the vocals are RETARTED.
2,Can You Hear Me Now? Not!!,"This device is a very nice size and I can hear every body that I call very clearly but everyone tells me that I sound like I am talking into a coffee can, if I am at home or traveling in my car.I would like to return this for a refund."
2,Charger Unit Fails,"This trimmer works very well but the problem is the charger units keep burning up and they are not cheap to buy. It was actually more cost-effective to buy another trimmer with its included battery and charger. But after my third charger ( I even bought one separately) burned out ,I give up. I will be buying a different brand now."
2,"Good Trimmer, Poor Charger","I purchased the trimmer and charged the battery. I trimmed for about 30 minutes non-stop. Plenty of power to cut through thicker bush branches. When recharging, the recharger burned out in about 3-5 minutes. I haven't priced a new charger, but I know they are expensive. Only 2 stars."
4,"Just read it and then, like also somebody else said, just look around and make your own opinion.","I would agree right away without any problem with all those who say that this is just propaganda if what I see around would be different. Just take a look to http://www.natall.com/who-rules-america for example. This book may be surely just a invention, but the facts that you see around at least tell you that there are some weird coincidences, although, maybe, they are just this, coincidences. Who knows."
1,The Pen Can Be Very Poisonous!,The only reason I can think of for reading this trash is to see how facts can be twisted and distorted to suit the view of the author and said author's personal prejudices.Beware! The pen can be more poisonous that the cobra!
1,This is the first conspiracy theory book.,"While the text is rather boring, I was intrigued by the fact that this was written before conspiracy theories became popular. Of course we now have rumors of people being controlled by mass media, so I found the book interesting.Other than that I don't believe a word of it. If this were written 100 years ago by a Russian, then it's false. They did't have the technology to gather such information if it were genuine. Had this book been written in 1998, I would treat it a little more seriously."
1,A repugnant aid to murderous racists for over a 100 years!,"Get yours today! Buy this wonderful pack of lies and we'll add in these titles at no extra charge: why [insert your ethnic group here] is the supreme race destined to rule the world; how everything bad that happens is because of the accursed jews; why not only the holocaust but the whole Second World War is nothing but Jewish-Zionist propoganda; and more! Buy it now, before we run out!So, enjoy your reading, and may your soul get its just reward."
1,What idiot put this under Judaism?,"Does no one edit your site assignemnts for accuracy? Obviously not. This is not a book of Judaism. but a classic of anti-semitism. The same Jew-haters who deny the holocaust and warn against the Jewish takeover of our banking system and our movie industry, used to piously quote this rabid piece of Tsarist propaganda to justify their hatred. As prior reviews here attest, they are still with us, though now they are propably more occupied with proving that Obama is not a citizen.Nothing will convince these idiots and rational argument is a waste. New readers in search of real Judaica, however, should be warned in advance what this is. I don't notice anti-Catholic rantings offered on Amazon Anti-Black ravings aren't offered under any Amazon tags that I can find. It is hard to believe that this just slipped by unless whoever checks these things is blissfully ignorant. At least warn your readers."
1,not worth the cost or the hype,I purhased this book on a whim to see what all the negative publicity is about and it is well deserved as it is just a plaigirized work transformed into an antisemitism manifesto.
5,"replace Jew with ""global elite"" and then it makes sense","This work is not fiction, despite all the one star reviewers desperately trying to keep you from reading this book. It is also not a work by Jews, rather it became that in order to disguise the real authors: the wealthiest elite of the world who are working for the ultimate age old prize - global domination. Once you get past the obvious smoke screen of Jewish authorship, planted for the ""uninitiated"", and ignorantly believed by all these simpletons who have written the majority of the reviews for this book, you see the air clear, and then it makes sense. Common sense says that if you had tremendous wealth and power, would'nt you take it a step further? If you could not have it all yourself, would you not conspire with your colleagues to have it all together? Come on and wake up, conspiracy is a fact, not ""theory""."
1,Interesting views...,"I, along with the vast majority of fair-minded people, abhor the authors, the claims, the supporters and the motives of this book. It is one of the more disgusting pieces of literature that has ever been written. Unfortunately, it has been translated into innumerable languages and is taken as truth by many in the region where it does the most harm, the Middle East.I am a ""Goyim"" and therefore have no religious, racial or historical link with the Jewish people, but I despise this book nonetheless because it upholds everything that the forces of ignorance and hatred champion.Despite this, I do not support the censorship of this book. It needs to be read in order to shed light on its utterly ridiculous and harmful nature. I usually do not write reviews for books, but after seeing a shocking number of reviewers giving a fair reviewing of it, I felt compelled to write my own opinion."
1,Protocols A Forgery Declare Columbia Univ & Russian Court,"The following is provided as a public service to all who are concerned with the Protocols Affair. ""As early as 1921, the English journalist Philip Graves exposed the similarity between the Protocols and a political satire by Maurice Joly, 'Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu' (1864). Subsequent investigation showed the original document to be a forgery written by members of the Russian secret police."" -The New Columbia Encyclopedia, Columbia University Press, New York and London, 1975, p. 2229. Additionally, in 1994, after an exhaustive year-long investigation, a Russian District Court in Moscow, Judge Ludmilla Belikova presiding, ruled that the Czarist-era 'Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion' was, in fact, a forgery and that its publication constituted an antisemitic act."
2,It is what it is- an antisemitic concoction of last Czar's secret police,"This doesn't really deserve a review: this book has only historic and political interest. Helps to understand political climate of virulent antisemitism which penetrated life in Europe in late 19th-early 20th century and culminated in Holocaust at mid 20th century. Government of Nicholas II - last Russian Czar, and he personally were antisemitic and tried to save increasingly bankrupt regime by inciting extreme nationalistic and antisemitic feelings in the populace. Otherwise book has no merit."
1,"This potent, repugnant forgery requires context","Anyone who has a genuine interest in this book and its history will be better served by Binjamin Segal's A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Segel's work is from 1926, translated and supplemented with an excellent and lengthy introduction by University of Illinois-Chicago professor Richard Levy. An appendix excerpts the Protocols themselves, and this should be enough primary material for anyone who wants to introduce themselves to the ludicrous text itself."
1,If it wasn't so hateful it would be ludicrous,"The biggest proof that this book is false is the ridiculoususe of ""references"" about Judaism that show a total lack ofany familiarity with real Jews or Judaism. It quotes rabbis who never existed and whose names are so silly, they are obviously made up. It uses supposedly Hebrew terms in ways any first-year Hebrew language student can see are wrong... In short, it was either written by an antisemite or a total idiot (or maybe both.) The first time I came across this book many years ago, it was in a mimeographed form that I thought was supposed to be a joke -- like ""Legends of the Ferengi"" and other spoofs on stereotypes. Sadly, it's not intended as a joke at all. Also sadly, there are still people around who are being taken in by what may be the biggest hoax of all time. Sprucing it up in an expensive new edition (talk about hypocrisy!) does nothing improve the idiocy inside the covers. Save your money, folks -- it's just not worth it. END"
1,Way tooooooo much unjustified hype,"I purchased this book coz of the hype!Way tooooooo much unjustified hype!!!Don't recommend - unless u want a lesson on anti-semitism ;-)BTW: if you are still keen, copies is available free online"
5,You cannot argue facts using censorship...,"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, issued by Theodore Herzl to the Zionist Congress held in Basel, Switzerland in 1897. He outlines a plan for world power by gaining control of the media, politicians, governments, etc., to build the ""New World Order."" Written 100 years ago, today we can see it's plans becoming a reality before our very own eyes. Confronting the historical events that took place after the book was written and the plans outlined inside it, provides an iron proof of the book authenticity."
1,Shameful,"""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" is racist and anti-semitic to its black core. Conceived and executed over a hundred years ago by the Czarist secret police, it purports to spell out a secret Jewish plan for world domination. The language is laughably inept. Despite the fact that it has been demonstrated to be fraudulent beyond a reasonable doubt, beyond all doubt, to a moral certainty, this pernicious book has taken on a life of its own even in the face of the condemnation of decent people worldwide. It is a short leap from believing the tripe in ""Protocols"" to believing that the Holocaust never happened."
2,hmmmmmm.....,"This is an extremely hateful and rediculous book full of propoganda clearly aimed at hurting the Jewish populance... HOWEVER, i do fully endorse the idea of freedom of expression (no matter how wrong you are or how ludicrous your ideas are)and i think that you should be able to express them. That is the whole reaon why i emigrated to America... FREEDOMP.S. I am a Russian Jew!!!"
5,Great book!,"Almost everything stated in this book has proven true,its almost scary..kinda funny that a book that was claimed to be a forgery has proven to be true on every account 50 years later,folks Zionism is alive and well Zionism is very real..the Zionist have an agenda detailed in this book of world wide supremacy and will stop at NOTHING to obtain it,absolutely NOTHING is off limits to achieve their goals,..the Zionist lie and label you an anti-Semite when you confront them on this book,they cannot hide from the truth this book details the very evils of Zionism as we see in modern day times,buy this book and arm yourself with the knowledge to uncover the truth..i recommend Jewish Supremacism by David Duke as well!!"
4,Boring but good for researching the NWO,"Debate till your blue in the face if you want to whether its forgery or not or debate whether you can point fingers at and blame all the worlds ills on the Jews, the Masons, the Illuminati, the bankers, the British and other European Royal families, multi-national corporations, blah, blah, blah, etc. I just look at this as fairly accurate depiction of what the social/economic/political engineers have done and are doing since it was published. As far as entertainment value I would liken reading the Protocols to watching paint dry, VERY boring, but you should still probably read this if your researching the globalist/new world order conspiracy."
3,it's okay,"The film was not what I expected, it could have been better. I slept through part of it without missing a beat."
5,Easily one of the best,"The first I ever heard of Primus was 'Wynona's Big Brown Beaver' on the radio, and I didn't pay it much attention. It wasn't until I saw their performance on the Woodstock '94 video that I opened my eyes and went out of my way to hear everything Primus that I could get my hands on.Primus is really ugly music, so if you've never heard it before, you'll probably think 'yerg' when you first hear it. It's only after a few listens that you begin to notice how amazingly talented each member of the band is.In Australia, Frizzle Fry is actually fairly hard to find, so I only very recently added it to my collection, and I have to say that it rates highly among the Primus albums.Frizzle Fry is actually a heavier Primus album, which is a fairly even mix of new songs and studio versions of the songs they played on their first album, the live EP 'Suck on This'.The studion versions of old songs are definately worth a listen, but it is the new tracks that really stand out."
4,caveat emptor,"No quibbles with the other reviews here. It's a good Primus record.However, it is presented in this version as having extra tracks. There is only ONE extra track, a cover of Hello Skinny/Constantinople."
2,WAY overrated.,"I know avant garde music-I dont hate this CD because I think it sounds too weird or different-Ive heard far weirder and different stuff. All Primus are are the Residents with a better bassist. Onto him. Les Claypool. Many misinformed bassists think hes the best bassist ever. Those people havent heard of Victor Wooten or Jaco Pastorius; they can definitely one up Les anyday using only one hand. They both have wonderful solo careers. As for his style, Rob Wright of Nomeansno sounds like him, and he was around before Claypool. And hes a punk bassist for gods sake, and hes more technical than Claypool, and far more funkier, in my opinion. If I put that all past me, this is a pretty nice funky CD. But certainly no classic bass CD."
5,Trust Me!! !!!!!!!!!! I know for sure.....,"Frizzle Fry.... Wow! Not only did this album take me to a place I'd never been before with music. But years ago when I heard the album it got me hooked and it will remain with me forever as the album of only the utmost respect. If you are thinking of getting a Primus album and you could only get one make this your choice. Trust me you won't regrect it!Words can't describe this album, its just more than genius."
4,Frizzle's the shizzle.,"I remember back in 1990-92, ""Primus"" was one of the primo punk/funk bands along side ""Jane's Addiction"", ""Faith No More"", and the ""Chili Peppers"". That was then. Haven't heard much from them since ""Tales from the Punchbowl"". ""Primus"" seems to be one of those bands that started out strong, and then lost it a bit with each release. Meaning that to me, ""Frizzle Fry"" is the best of theirs. ""Sailing the seas of cheese"" is just as good too. After that they seemed to loose their edge. If you enjoy ""Primus"" and don't know the songs ""Too many puppies"", or ""John the fisherman"", that's like a Zeppelin fan not knowing ""Stairway to heaven"". This is simply an awesome funk/punk debut. I'm not sure what Les is doing now, but I think it's time for that ""best of"" to come out."
1,dissapointing,"this isnt the cd you're thinking of. angie hart and her husband jess are nowhere on this album. it's some band from scotland. i was pretty damn dissapointed, and once i had opened it, couldn't return it. so if you're a frente fan, don't buy this cd, you'll be stuck with twelve or so tracks of mediocre british whatnot."
5,Superb second album from Scottish band,'Pull me in' is the second offering from Edinburgh band Splendid. The album has a lot to offer any lover of bands like Crowded House or Semisonic. Lead singer Alan Windrams' writing and vocal talents are supported by an equally talented band of musicians. If you enjoy catchy melodies and classic guitar pop then this one is for you.
4,It may not be Frente but it is SPLENDID,If Nothingman is such a big fan of Frente how come he hadn't checked their website to find out what Aussi Splendid's new album was called? His cutting comments seemed to have more to do with him having bought the wrong album rather than a real review of the music. I bought the UK Splendid's album a few months ago on spec and loved it. British it may be but bland it is not. The catchy melodies and jangly guitars hook you instantly. It's the perfect album to have blaring from your car stereo on a warm summers day. You won't be disappointed!
5,Beautiful and Functional,I love the way this sink looks. It is different because it sits higher than most and has a lovely design. I have gotten many compliments. I highly recommend it!
2,Poor Quality Sink,"I received product quickly and thru some personal issues could not install for quite a while. When I finally got counter installed from Home Depot I was able to install sink. It fit the hole fine, but the underside of the sink was curved from the baking process when manufactured. I had to grind the high spots down and use extra caulking to make it work. Both my contractor and plumber told me I should have just returned it. If I had my project would have been further delayed. I feel like I got a ""Second"" or ""Re-ject"" sink. In the end I was able to make it work, but for the money....poor quality or bad inspection..."
5,Elegant yet old-fashioned,This sink is much more beautiful than the picture depicts. I put it in an antique piece of furniture and used an oil-rubbed bronze faucet for the downstairs guest bathroom.... everyone loves the end result. Great find at a great price!!
4,"Slow, ""heavy"", but worthy...","Hortense, a young black woman, loses her adoptive Mother and commences a search to find her birth mother. She learns that her birth mother is Cynthia, a single parent working in a stamping factory and just making things meet. The story grows when secrets and lies begin to come out - and explode during a birthday barbecue for Cynthia's 21 year old daughter.Reviews describe this movie as ""hysterically funny and profoundly sad"". While there were flashes of humor in the movie, I would agree with the ""profoundly sad"" characterization and there was plenty of gloom to go around here.The first 30-45 minutes of setting the stage were quite slow so hang in there as the storyline starts to become quite engaging. The casting and acting by/for all of the major characters is terrific - the psychological anguish is apparent from the get-go - and the cinematography is wonderful."
1,Secret and Lies - Chinese Import,Movie is superlative. DVD is very poor. It has no DVD menu. It is impossible to turn the Chinese subtitles off.
5,A brilliant piece of realism.,This movie made me laugh and cry. It was so real and so human it was like somebody took a camera and hit it in the walls of the house of a real family going through all this. These are the films that deserve the awards. Pictures like this one rarely come out anymore so catch this one. It's a triumph for Mike Leigh and I simply loved Brenda Blethyn's performance as well as Marianne Jean-Baptiste's. Truly this was the Best Picture of the year.
5,Should have won tons of Oscars,"This movie is amazing and I STILL can't believe Brenda Blethyn didn't win Best Actress! It also should have won Best Picture, and a nomination for Timothy Spall. I can't say enough great things about this movie, but if you want to see an adult drama about real people, ""Secrets & Lies"" is unsurpassed."
2,Warning [IMPORT],"Although ""Secrets & Lies"" by Mike Leigh is a great movie, a five (5) star movie, this version on DVD is not. The [IMPORT] label on the title does not mean it's from England. Instead, it's an Asian import with large Chinese character subtitles on the bottom of the screen. These are not optional subtitles; you can not remove them and they can be very annoying at times. In fact, there are no other subtitles available, even though English subtitles would have been very helpful with the dialogue at times. Sorry to give you the bad news for such a fine movie."
5,very good,"Purchase was flawless--no problems.Movie itself was entertaining.This may be a different version; I remember a line from me seeing it some time ago. The line (dialog) was: ""I should have never come here!""I do not recall hearing it in this version!??"
4,Kitchen-sink comedy/drama with heart,"Mike Leigh's film won Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival. A young black woman decides to find her birth-mother only to discover her mother is white, just one among many of the SECRETS & LIES of this tale. A first-rate cast delivers knock-out performances. A bit on the long side, the film has both drama and comical moments, with a healthy helping of tenderness. The DVD has a good quality transfer of the widescreen original but no bonus features apart from the trailer (and a few other trailers). A first-rate comedy/drama with heart!"
1,AVOID THE DVD (IMPORT) VERSION,"I, too, ordered this DVD from Amazon--only to find that it has Chinese subtitles that you CANNOT turn off. Amazon should absolutely include this information in their technical description. The picture quality was poor, and there is no menu or additional features. I could have overlooked the lack of features, but the subtitles are completely distracting. (Additional note: expect the same problem if you order the DVD (import) version of Beautiful Thing, another fabulous British film from a few years ago.)"
3,Secrets & Lies Import leaves much to be desired,"I'm a big fan of the movie Secrets & Lies, so when I heard that it was finally out on DVD I rushed to get it. When it arrived it was an import from Hong Kong with Chinese subtitles that cannot be shut off. The transfer quality is about equal to (or even less than) the VHS version, and there are no extras. While I'm glad I can jump to a scene, I wouldn't be in a great hurry to purchase this disc. Wait until it's done by another company in a more conscientious and fuller way."
2,Secrets & Lies DVD,"The movie itself is great, one of my favorites. The DVD I purchased is of very poor quality. The video quality is poor, which makes me believe it's a pirated copy. The notes on the DVD case are in an Asian language. In addition, it has subtitles in an Asian language that cannot be disabled, thus the bottom portion of the screen is obscured by the subtitles. I'm very dissatisfied with the product overall, and feel my money was wasted. I should have searched for another seller."
4,awsome details and descriptions,"this is for a study, collection, and reference. well suited for all for for my needs."
4,It's time to get mushy,"This movies is an authentic story of traditional hollywood romanticism. Rob Lowe makes a well deserved performance as the condecending, arogant fashion designer Francesco Salvitore as Jeniffer Grey plays the poor little shy Kelly Carter who is a brilliant fashion designer but is not recognized for her work buy Salvitore(Lowe). This movie makes you mush up all over. With Yes it is a corny, and predictable plot but just looking at Lowe's beautifull blue eyes, is enough to make you want to sit throught the entire movie. With Rob Lowe's handsome and flirtasious good looks, who wouldn't want to sit through 2 hours of corny yet satisfying entertainment."
4,A Good Live Action Modernized Version Of Cinderella!,"Cinderella is one of my favorite fairytales and I absolutely love the animated Disney movie but I saw this live action modernized updated version and I liked it. Jennifer Grey and Rob Lowe are great and made a cute couple! BY THE WAY, I too wonder why they changed the original title, from If The She Fits to Stroke of Midnight?"
2,if the show fits,i would liked to know that i was going to need a multi-region dvd player before i bought the movie... but i guess it was my fault since i didnt read the label cause i was too happy cause i found it on your website. But trust me this is the first and last time that i would buy a movie online....
3,Gong - 'Expesso II' (Blute Plate/Caroline),"Originally released in 1978,as this CD reissue turned out to be a bit better than what I had expected.I mean,with percussionist Pierre Morlen(R.I.P.)acting as band leader,plus the fact that guitarist Allan Holdworth was now in the group makes this a decent Daevid Allen-less Gong album.I've heard numerous long-time Gong fans mention how they really like this,yet more jazzy/Canterbury styled catalog title.Give it a chance."
4,a great disc,"Killer percussive jazz/rock. Outstanding, fat & funky bass lines, cool vibes/marimba and vintage Holdsworth. What more do you want?????"
2,sleepy and boring,"I'm a huge fan of Daevid Allen's Gong, but take away Daevid Allen and you're left with somnambulism like this. Proof that technique will never win over creativity. It's hard to believe that it's the same drummer that's on the great Gong albums. Here's a tip: read the track titles."
5,Works as advertised,Best price i can find for this...shipped fast and works great. It fixes the problem I had with an OLD toy chest that we inherited.
5,The last studio album till recently: very different,"the loss of two of the most important architects in the sound of the band neccesitated a change. A lot more songs than have been on other van der graaf albums. Lots of violin, more pop hooks, strange textures, weird lyrics etc. Definitely a very worthwhile last album. I hope present is as good as this."
2,You can pass it,"VdGG was great in ""Sill life"" and ""A world record"" but that was earlier. The new sound of ""The quiet zone"", with the violin - does'nt do. But this is not all. the album is weaker and boring, and it seems that Hammill worked harder on his solo album ""Over"". ""Cat's eye"" with its gypsy violin is the best. The rest are under the averege of the band."
3,"I own it, but rarely listen to it","Every band has a nadir. This is Van der Graaf Generator's, and I can only agree with Arye and Resun below. Normally, I will allow Hammill an enormous leeway for artistic license, but here, I'm not sufficiently entranced to wonder what he's trying to accomplish. Ironically, though, this might be a favorite for people who don't like normal prog-rock indulgences.I will say, though, that the lamentations for the passing of David Jackson's saxophone are hardly germane. Bands evolve, personnel change. And David Jackson's saxophone has always been the least interesting aspect of Van der Graaf Generator for me. Violin, therefore, is not at all a terrible change, and what Stuart Gordon does with his instrument is hardly without interest. Besides, if you like electric violin, then it's certainly wonderful to be able to find some on disc and so give your old Kansas collection a rest for once."
2,Zone of Little Pleasure,"There's a violin player on here that sounds like a cross between L.Shankar and Stephane Grappelli instead of David Jackson on saax and winds. Hammill's voice has disappeared, when he tries to sing, it's as if he's talking, when he screams nothing comes out. Why he decided to record with his voice in this condition, I have no idea. The drums sound fantastic and overall the songs are more interesting but not necessarily better than on ""Still Life."" The 3 standouts are Lizard Play, Cat's Eye/Yellow Fever, and The Sphinx in the Face, but there's nothing here that even comes close to the level of the pre-'73 Van Der Graaf Generator records. Don't say I didn't warn you."
2,"First one came broken, second one just broke.","So the first one of these Better Living AVIVA dispensers came broken and unusable. Amazon had another one out to me in two days. Nothing bad about that. Then I got my replacement and it lasted for about 36 hours before the adhesive tape that came with it let go from the wall sending the dispenser crashing to the floor and leaving what can only be described as BP sized soap spill all over my bathroom. It looked nice and I really wanted it to work, but its just a cheap piece of plastic. If you do buy this, I highly recommend you mounting it to the wall with screws. It looks nice, but I wont be wasting any more time or money with this product."
2,If it ain't broke don't fix it- Previous model is much better.,"I had this for a short while and it would begin leaking a short while after. Then a friend bought me a new one and the same thing happened. It turns out that the little view window (which you don't need anyway because most of the bottle is clear and you can see how much is inside) makes the mechanism more vulnerable to leaks. Somehow the little view window over the button slowly wears away with certain soaps and leaks occur. I got their previous version which is also sold on Amazon. Not only does it not ever leak even after months and months of use, but it also holds more soap while looking great in the bathroom. In my opinion it even looks better too. Here's the link on amazon. [...]Edit: ok so it seems I'm not allowed to post the link, but if you search for ""Better Living Chrome Clear Choice Dispenser"" it should come up."
3,Space saver,Good quality product. Glues to the shower tile firmly. Easy to fill and easy to see liquid level. The squirting mechanism is reliable and helps alleviate product waste. No leaking.No more bottles on the bathtub rim!
4,Perfect replacement,"Replaced 3 well-worn dispensers in a 3-space rack in use for several years. Did not need the included mounting plate, but otherwise a perfect fit."
2,Caution: This product must be GLUED to your shower wall,I guess it's my fault for not reading the product description more carefully. I just can't believe most people would want a product that has to be (semi-) permanently installed. What if it breaks? What if I want to clean it out? What if I want to clean under the mounting? I guess I *assumed* it was installed via a suction cup like my old dispenser. I was swayed by its good looks... that's my story and I'm sticking to it.So I went ahead and installed it. Sure enough it's an annoying 2-3 degrees off vertical. Too bad - so sad: can't fix it now. But It does look good and it pumps well. Maybe I can just sell the house before I need to replace or remove this dispenser ;-(
2,Pump is tricky,"Purchased this to replace one that broke. I still cant get the pump to work right. When I got the first set they worked great, then one pump stopped working, and now I can not get the new one to work again."
4,Just as advertised,I have 2 of the single units in my homes and a triple unit in our motorhome and the fit the bill just fine
4,A good purchase.,I am glad this single was available. We also purchased the dispenser with three chambers and three was not enough for my husband and I. I would have liked a 4 chamber dispenser in this style but could not find one.
4,Could hold a little more...,"I am quite pleased with the product. Better quality than I had anticipated. I am using it as a mouthwash dispenser. I put it up on a vanity mirror and it is holding quite well. I was a little nervous that I would be left with the sticky stuff on my mirror if it didn't work out, but it is sturdy and has held. It also dispenses just the right amount with one pump. I just may have to consider order a couple more for in the shower afterall."
5,"Stop looking, this is the one!","I can't say enough good things about this dispenser. It is easy to install, even easier to fill, it looks GREAT. It doesn't drip and I got rid of the different kinds of bottled liquid soap that were sitting by the sink before. Love, love, love this! I bought three more to put by all sinks and one for the guest bathroom shower."
3,Pretty good cookies,"When I use this mix, I usually add raisins, nuts, vanilla & rolled oats......... so i may as well make them from scratch."
3,Not bad if you must go organic,"If you have to go organic, this is the best way to make oatmeal cookies. But there is something missing. They are tasty, not that many (18 medium sized ones) for $5 a box, but they are not chewy like real oatmeal cookies. Don't seem to have much oatmeal, mainly flour and sugar. You could try adding oatmeal, but maybe would need more risers or spices. They are pleasant and soft if not overcooked, but not enough oatmeal for me."
5,i could completely understand this!,"Dumped is a great book to read if you have just been dumped or if you are still hurting from a dump in the past....The stories are really sad but they are enjoyable to read....it is nice to read that these characters are going through the same emotions that i am going through right now....one of my favorite stories in the book is ""lamb for a slaughter"" (or something like that)....you will be surprised with the wife's reaction when her husband tells her that he is leaving her."
1,an inspiration,"i just purchased this book and im glad that i got it at a 99 cents store.im amazed that mr palmer makes a living WRITTING.the mechanics used by the author are similar to the ones teenagers use in social network websites.the book seems to be nothing more that a long twiter.i started writting a book a few years ago,in spanish my first language,and i stopped thinking it was not good enough.reading mr palmer WORK has giving me new hope.i mean, if he got published,why not me?"
2,Disappointing,"This ""book"" with large type and few pages can be read in one sitting and does not live up to its billing as a look behind the scenes of an NBA season. All this book actually amounts to is a short synopsis of an NBA season with little interaction between the players the author is supposed to be introducing us to and himself. At points it comes across as ego stroking on Palmer's part dropping names of all the people who know him and how he gets into all the parties at All-Star weekend. The premise of this book has potential, unfortunately Palmer does not deliver what it is billed as."
2,Disappointing,"I found this in a discount book store, and was hoping that it would be an interesting, behind-the-scenes look at how NBA players live when they're not playing a game. Instead, it was basically Palmer's tale of trying (mostly unsuccessfully) to get access to a handful of players, but reaping the benefits of swimming in their wake. I agree with most of the other reviews about this book, and found it a chore just to finish it. Not something I would recommend."
1,Lame Waste of Time,"I got this book at the dollar store, even for $1 I feel ripped off. Most of the narrative is about players avoiding Chris Palmer, Palmer going to the wrong address, Palmer's notes flying out the window or getting stolen, Palmer getting a toothache, Palmer's hard drive crashing. This shoddy book reads like an extended excuse for why he didn't write a decent book."
2,Waste of Time,"I realize the book doesn't portray itself as a hard nose expose or anything like that, but what it amounts to is a writer name-dropping and basically mentioning the perks of being an ESPN writer. There is no in-depth character study of any of the players and the disconnect displayed makes the book very uninteresting. I know nothing more about any of these players than what I have seen already during Sunday Sportcenter pieces. If you're looking for a glimpse into the life of players, this book will keep you waiting, just like the writers are kept waiting by the players. The author definitely left on a miss with this one."
1,Book Sucks,"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. It provided no insight into the players inside the NBA culture. All the author wrote about is how he gets shafted every time he tries to go out with the players after games. It is very clear that the players wanted no part in a writer witnessing their lives outside the court. Instead all we get is an inside look at how a writer travels in the NBA and trust me, it is not exciting!!! Don't waste your money."
5,Swept away in the book,"Men have the porn and we have this book. This was totally different than the types of books I usually read. I was amazed by the detail, heat and contents of the book. I will definitely refer this to other woman (or men) who want to add passion to their lives. I will also home that more of Toni's books are in this nature."
5,Wow...this one hits home..,"I have never read any novels by Toni Blake. I was amazed!!! Kat's character battled internally with questions that are close to everyone's heart..the battle between what you should do and what you want to do, even when what you should do is the most difficult choice. I cried many tears for Kat and Brock while reading this book. And while I kind of agree that the subplot of Kat's mom probably wasn't needed, I think Ms. Blake wanted to reflect in another way what is right and wrong, kind of like mother and daughter were going through the same struggle. Although Kat's mom felt neglected, she recognized true love, and I think that is the point of the story, to bring to life that the heart always knows what it wants. LIGHT SPOILER: The added story of the pendant brought magic, which I think is missing in a lot of novels. What a FANTASTIC book!!!! Bravo Toni Blake!!!!!"
5,Fell in love with it!,"I was swept away! Short review since others have submitted more extensive ones, but I just had to give my opinion. It's a lovely romantic story of love lost and then found. The tension was unbelievable making it all the more sensual. The idea of being stranded on an island with a HOT FBI agent is enough to get my blood flowing! I highly recommend this page turner you will not regret it."
4,A sensual story of love finally conquered,"Katrina Spencer escapes to a deserted island to ponder her life before getting married. Little did she know that the guy she had the hots for in high school, and never got over, would wash up on shore. FBI agent Brock Denton can't believe his eyes when the girl who haunts him in his darkest hours, is sunbathing topless on the beach he happens to escape to. A smoldering seduction begins, mixed with a dangerous criminal pursuit that Brock fears will end more than a visit to paradise. The two spend the short time they have together doing what Brock denied Katrina in high school. She wanted to give him her virginity, and he shut her down. He makes it up to her tenfold, and she walks away more confused than ever. This is a sexy, fun, and enjoyable read."
3,"OK mystery series, terrible dvd case","This series is enjoyed more for the gardening and landscaping than the quality of the mysteries. The gardens are beautiful, but the mystery all too predictable. Most often, the murderer is a woman and the victims are men so the series can be enjoyed by divorcees. The police are always clueless and bumbling to better highlight the clever ladies. The dvd case is a real problem. It is very difficult to remove the dvds because the plastic is hard and stiff. The dvds' bend more easily so we are concerned about breaking the one that we are attempting to remove. This is a must-fix!"
5,rosemary and thyme,"this set is magnificent. the gardens are lovely, the stories very good and the characters excellent, this is my second set, i like it that much. buy it, you will love it."
4,Engaging entertainment. A garden of delights.,"I've watched most of the episodes on PBS in America, where I reside, and have enjoyed them very much, eagerly watching them again when rerun.The series is original, with engaging stars, well written plots, and a variety of beautiful locations. (wish the credits listed the names of locations)Different from Brother Cadfael, of course, yet with similar methods of deducing the crimes.Refreshing. I recommend it."
5,Fantastic bit of Brit mystery and life,"I love British mystery and humor and this series has both in spades. If you like mysteries, gardening, spunky women and all things British, then this is a great show for you. It is just plain enjoyable."
4,A Gift for Mom,"An excellent gift for my mother, whom is both a gardener and a fan of British mysteries."
5,Great CD Series,This is a wonderful set for fans of British TV. The comedy/mystery combination of Rosemary & Thyme is a delight!
2,No Closed Captions,"My wife loves this show, but she is very hard of hearing. We were very disappointed when we started playing the DVDs last night to find out there were no closed captions on them, unlike on the PBS broadcasts of the show.Yes, I should have looked before I ordered them, but it was still a disappointment for her."
4,4:3 aspect ratio,"I've had this boxset for around two years and it's great, however on the back of the box is printed that the set has a 16:9 aspect ratio and this is incorrect. It's a standard television ratio of 4:3. I'm not really sure why the misprint is there, but if you check the back of your box you'll see it too.Overall this is a great collection, there are a total of 23 episodes (if you count the two-parter ""Memory of Water"" as two separate episodes, otherwise it's 22 episodes). And an eight minute interview with Pam and Felicity."
1,What was he thinking?,"I can not believe that this turned out so badly. I was waiting forever for the re-release, and the moment I heard that Froese had ""added"" something to it, I felt sick to my stomach.After listening to this now three times over two weeks, my stomach is empty!DO NOT BUY THIS - this was sacred territory, and the creator of it, has all but ruined it."
3,Edgar Froese - 'Epsilon In Malaysian Pale' (Caroline),"Originally released in 1975, this was the Tangerine Dream main man's second solo effort. You get two lengthy tracks here,the title cut ""Epsilon In Malaysian Pale""(17:00) and ""Maroubra Bay"" (17:15), which both tend to flow together. This piece, overall has a nice flow to it and at times it appears to be semi-hypnotic, but it's STILL pretty much aimed toward the completists and die-hards. Casual Tangerine Dream fans might want to listen to the provided sound bites of this CD you can locate anywhere."
1,A Word of Caution,You should know that this book appears to be written by a 7th day adventist. He quotes from Ellen G. White.
5,Hatch Huevos Rancheros Sauce,This sauce is the best tasting for Huevos Rancheros. It's easy. Goes on top of eggs and it is great. Just hard to find.
4,Western Apache Dictionary,"This dictionary is relatively small (only 2000 entries). However, the entries are very well-done with different verb forms, dialect variations, and sample phrases. There is also a good grammatical overview and pronunciation guide. Please note that this is the Western Apache language, which is significantly different from the Chiricahua Apache language--the two languages are related, but no more so than French and Spanish are, so don't buy this dictionary hoping to read or learn Chiricahua Apache!"
3,western Apatche english dictionary..........,As my partner n I are Native American..........he Lepan Apatche.......of the Panteleon Clan..........n I Tewa n Mescalero Apatche ..........it was a decent dictionary.........yet the title Is somewhat misleading bcuz there r several Apatche tribes n Clans........dialects.........tongues.........in all a decent book
5,Just Right,The style and material is just what I was looking for in swim trunks...not long and baggy.
5,This is the ultimate in comfort and performance.,"I've been wearing these shorts for over 15 years and can't say enough good things about them. I use them as casual wear while at home, to sleep every night, to go jogging, and for swimming. They are quick drying when wet (few hours at most), ultra lightweight and the most comfortable thing to wear. I suggest you order up one full size unless you want a snug fit. After the inside mesh wore out some 10 years after I purchased my first ones, I can still wear them with underpants. Air dry them after washing and they basically last forever."
4,Fascinating!,"I don't know what the members of Gong were smoking when they created this recording...but it worked! There is some deep music here, and it is recorded with a clarity of sound that rivals much of what came outin the early 70's. Fans of the progressive genre will find extraordinary playing (including one of the most amazing drummers you will ever hear), strange use of non-traditional instruments (including the mbira, an african thumb piano), and wildly shifting time signatures. Fans of psychadelic music will find ""space-whispers"" and ""pot-head pixies"" galore. I wouldn't recommend this as the first place to experience Gong -- that would be the ""You"" CD -- but this is as good as any of their recordings for experiencing the Gong sound. Progressive, jazzy, weird, and just plain fun. Recommended."
5,"""It's a hassle you know, to make rocket ships go to infinity","Gong are suprisingly unknown. Their music involved a blending of rock and jazz, with the lyrics involving a blending of psychadelics and philsophy; all underpinned by a delightful sense of humour. They were formed by an Australian in England, had an Irish lead guitarist, but were based in France. Great music! Should be better known."
1,Don't waste your money,"First off, this wide angle converter is NOT made specifically for your digital camera. The only match is the thread size. I bought this for my Olympus 8080 (not sure why it came up with this other designation) and it causes vignettting (cutting off of the corners at it widest angle) and more importantly, produced horrible distortion reminiscent of a fun house mirror.I would only buy this lens if you specifically wanted to take spherically distorted pictures, not if you really want a wide angle. Instead go with the manufacturer's wide angle which is designed specifically for the camera."
3,Useful to some extent,"While this book is full of useful information, it seems better suited to the novice than to someone with experience. I can see how the book may provide insights into how client accounting works, but I found very little that I could apply to my own job as a client accounting/billing coordinator. If you work at a large, established firm, or hope to find employment in one, avoid this book. These firms already have their own entrenched systems with extensive training. This book will be useful if you are with a smaller firm or one just starting out. It will assist with ideas on how to establish your own systems."
5,I Love this Book,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be taken away from you family, friends and the city that you love? Well in the story ""Theras and His Town"" by Caroline Dale Snedeker, that is exactly what happens. Theras is the main character and is a lively and curious boy who loves his hometown of Athens. The story is set in ancient Greece. It is about how Theras' father dies in war and his mother can support him. So he is sent to Sparta a place that Theras doesn't like because of their cruelty. While there he meets a boy named Abas and then he finally makes a decision to make the long, dangerous, journey home to Athens with him. This book is well written and makes you feel like you are in ancient Greece. It also has a good amount of action and adventure to make you want to keep reading. I personally love this book because it is a story that you just want to keep on reading. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,"Excellent, uncompromised beauty","Really great photos of mounatin scapes in and about Yosimite. Waterfalls, forests, mountains and sky. Typical Ansel, most flawless."
2,NOT FOR MOTOROLLA/NEXTEL PHONES,These are made by nokia (what is on the item itself) and does not work with motorolla/Nextel phones.
5,Nothing...,"can explain what I feel at this moment, after having heard it for the first time only moments ago. It's has it's similarities to Ulver's Kveldssanger, but those are very faint, as these are two completely different bands and albums. I don't even know why I'm writing this. There is nothing to say except that this album is...beautiful. Nothing can explain it further."
1,just in it for the money,"If you were a fan of the original series, this book will leave you seriously wanting. It's clear from the wide margins, double spaced type, low page count, and the lack of any kind of character and plot development, that betancourt (and the publisher, too) is just in it for the money. Sadly, a truly original fantasy creation has been commercialized for a quick easy profit. This story in the hands of someone like Feist, or Goodkind, could have been fleshed out into a real three dimensional realm. All we have here is the skeleton of a story, and a 2 dimensional one at that."
3,This book is a shadow of its namesake.,This book is very formulaic as another reviewer mentioned. I am a big enough fan of Amber to want even these books; but everything just seems subtly wrong.Having to get to where Book one of the original series begins must have stretched the author's skill set. And as another reveiwer mentioned there is some contradictions to the original series; this book is a shadow of its namesake.
4,nice lotion,Very nice lotion. Gave with Mrs Meyers hand soap in gift basket for Christmas gifts. I kept one set for myself. I love it.
1,Check the pricing...,"At forty-three eighty-six per case of six (the price as I type this), the product comes to seven thirty one per bottle... you can get a bottle on the Mrs. Meyer's website for four ninety-nine. I'm just saying... do the math before you buy."
4,Why I Loved THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS IN TEXAS BY C. SMITH,"This little book is a great ""take off"" on Clement Moore's original and captures the essence of the Texas spirit. I hadgiven it as a gift to Texas friends, even BEFORE we moved here ourselves a few years ago, and will order several more copies this year. It truly is an annual treat!Steve Egan's illustrations in the book are a beautiful addition to this little holiday story.Buy one y'all."
4,The Clot Thickens.....,"I don't even like prog rock but I love this album. ""Plague of Lighthouse Keepers"" is everything prog rock is supposed to be but very rarely is, alternately scary, ambitious, beautiful, grandiose and plain MAD! The two other tracks are not bad either! With the instrumental brilliance of the band (Guy Evans is an astonishing drummer) and Peter Hammill's distinctive over-wrought vocals it's easy to forget that one of Hammill's greatest strengths as a writer is his melodic sense - it's all over this album. In spite of the ""difficulty"" of the music, this makes this actually one of VDGG's most listenable albums - especially to non-prog rockers like yours truly."
2,Not for every prog fan,"I tried hard but never really enjoyed this CD. If you're looking for anything super melodic and/or heavy this may not be for you. I can understand how some would like this CD though. It is unique, but not my cup of tea."
3,UUHHHMMMMM.........NOT,I've listened to this cd twice and I don't get it. Did this band go out of their way to make the most complex listen for the human ear. I would rather listen to prog jazz. I purchased this cd based on other reviews as I had never heard or heard of Van Der Graaf before and am disapointed. Sorry but in this case majority doesn't rule.
5,Intense English Prog Rock Masterpiece,"I first purchased this album in a university record store in 1979. It has had a profound and haunting impact ever since...How to describe it??? How about the existential angst of the darkest Pink Floyd meets the wildest sonic assault of earliest King Crimson with Peter Hammill trying to be the ""Hendrix of the voice"" on top of it all and singing profound lyrics at that. If that description appeals to you at all, purchase immediately!"
4,pawn hearts,"van der graaf generator are a very unique band. they are considered a progressive rock band, but its unlike any prog you are likely to hear anywhere else.van der graaf generator are not a band that has any standout solo musicians. it all sort of gels together to form a singular vibe. and it is beautiful.hammils vocals are (in my opinion) otherworldly.the music aint bad either.for fans of dark, moody music, check out van der graaf generator."
5,Great toy for infants/toddlers,"We were given the PJ Bear as a gift for our first child. She absolutely loves it. When we had our second child, our first child started role playing with her PJ Bear: putting diapers on it, burping it, giving it a bottle, etc. She also shares it with her little sister (since it has no hard parts - eyes are stitched, etc - it is perfect for sharing and won't hurt the baby like her other dolls/toys).We bought the tiger for our second child and we hope she enjoys it as much as our other daughter has enjoyed her bear. Just a suggestion, buy two so you have a back-up for when it needs to be washed (it is machine washable and can also go in the dryer!)."
4,A concise overview .,This book is as fine an overview of science and technology as one is going to find . A fine book on its own . However it really shines as a reference work when reading other more detailed (confusing !)books on specific subjects in the sciences.
2,Spend your money on Internet Training,"If you already know how to use the many search engines that are out there, don't waste your money. Everything in this book can be found with the use of a search engine. Plus, you will get the correct site address. There are many site addresses listed in the book that are incorrect."
2,i agree with guilurmoj,"i really like the cafe del mar series. i first got hooked up with it accidentally in a music store. since then i have grown to love the downtempo music genre. i always try to find other artist like cafe del mar but i find myself coming back everytime. cafe del mar is so well compiled. however, i never got hookup with volume 1. it never did it for me. many people say if you liek cafe del mar you got to have 1-7. volume 1 was too typical for my taste. nothing original. jose padilla did very good on the other 5 though (2-6). yeah, dont' buy volume 1 unless you have money to waste."
5,Some of the best music I have ever heard!!!!,I have now got the full collection all 6 CD's . I think it is a must for anyone's music collection to have at least one (my favourite being No.5)
2,...I am actually more fond of post-Padilla...,"Cafe Del Mar, volumen Ocho, a post Padilla compilation if I understood correctly is a collection of way better tunes than this first cd. This is my personal opinion. There is nothing wrong with exposing Penguin Cafe Orchestra to a greater audience, but frankly, I am way happier with the later Cafe Del Mar compilations - tunes are better, meld better together, there are more interesting originals... IMHO."
4,RAM WIZARD 460CC TITANIUM ADJUSTABLE DRIVER,Good club for the price. Wish manufacturer had included instructions of how to adjust weights for ball flight.
5,The Voice of an Angel,"Having only recently discovered Patty's music I feel like I have missed out on the greatest female singer/songwriter of the past 20 years. I recently purchased all of here albums and this has proven to be one of the best musical purchases I have made in a long time. Some of these songs on this particular album actually give me goosebumps. Standout tracks include: 'When It Don't Come Easy', 'Kite Song', 'Top of the World', 'Standing'. However, there isn't a bad song on this wonderfully complete album. The voice of an angel. It may have taken me far too long to discover Patty's music. But I will try and make up for lost time."
3,Prepare to be disappointed,"Nothing here stands out like the previous three CDs, except ""Standing"" which I'd already heard on the Silver Bell EP. ""Kite"" and ""Rowing Song"" are good, but only in comparison to the rest of the album. On her other albums they would be throwaways. Still, Patty is Patty - the incredible voice and sensibility make it worth more than a listen."
3,Disappointing,"It would be hard for most artists to live up to the kind of raw talent and brilliance Patty Griffin displayed with 1000 Kisses and some of her prior work. But for me, a big fan, this album just missed the mark. Neither the music or lyrics are that distinctive or remarkable. I found many of the lyrics in particular surprisingly immature and shallow for someone who has demonstrated such a poetic gift in the past, and the music simply fair. I've yet to find a song or two that are really standouts in the country/folk genre. The critics and greater public may have discovered Patty Griffin of late as this album has garnered some great reviews and is clearly selling well, but hopefully that success won't translate into more of the same from this artist. Hopefully, this collection of songs won't rank as anywhere near her peak, but as a smooth bump on her climb towards true musical greatness."
5,Probably the closest to an impulse buy I'll ever get,"So I was at the CD store (buying the new Straylight Run CD, btw, which is excellent), and I had some extra money, so I was trying to remember names from my extensive Amazon browsing of the night before, and all I came up with was the ""Impossible Dream"" title (the cover made quite an impression on me, I loved and still love the art) so I questioned the employees, who were thankfully NOT walmart employees and could, after a minute, tell me who I was looking for; Patty Griffin. And I bought the CD. I'm listening to it for the first time now, and it stirs something deep in me, although I don't know what. It could be nervousness at whether the CD is likeable. Because, you know, I /really/ want to like this CD. I want to be able to tell myself that impulse buys aren't all bad and my instincts are trustable. Nothing I can think of annoys me about what I'm hearing, so I guess it's good. Absence of bad. Okay yeah I'm falling in love with CD."
2,time the cruelest critic,"I don't think time will be kind to this release from one of America's shining new stars. While the force of her singing and some fine pieces of songcrafting come through, the album is adrift in weak songwriting, ill-conceived forays into blues and gospel, and most notably horrible engineering. No one makes you listen to a record with headphones(or just closely) but it usually helps to fully appreciate the music. Not in this case; close scrutiny is not advised. So we are left with some pretty sounding music that doesn't leave you with much to think or feel about."
1,Is the dumpster the origin of life?,"O.K., so I listened to this disk once and most likely won't again. On one of the cuts Patti sings ""standin"" five times in a row. C'mon now. Come up with any poet or songwriter of worth who would repeat the same word five times in a row. I can't help but think that Patti scoops her lyrics out of a dumpster dumpster dumpster dumpster dumpster."
3,Somewhat disappointed...,"Let me start by saying that ""Living With Ghosts"" and ""1000 Kisses"" are my two favorite CDs. Ever. So of course I prepurchased ""Impossible Dream"" expecting to love it equally. But I do not. There isn't anything really objectionable about this CD, it just isn't special enough to be a Patty Griffin CD. Whereas ""1000 Kisses"" in particular had a very eclectic song line-up that kept your ears in suspense from track to track, the songs on this CD just move in a lackluster fashion from one song to the next. It feels lazy. In that vein, her songwriting doesn't seem as tight or insightful as on her earlier CDs, and while the songs showcase the prettiness of her voice, they do not showcase the power. Given that my awe of Patty Griffin involves the fact that she sounds like an angel of both peace and vengeance, often in the same song, her much more subdued voice and delivery on this CD left me feeling somewhat disappointed."
5,Absolutely moving,This is my first Patti Griffin album. I heard it on public radio and bought it. Patti really seems to sing from the heart. She has a wonderful gift for words and great tunes to accompany them. Very listenable all the way through. If you enjoy folk/acoustic music you should really give this a listen. I look forward to listening to more of her music.
3,Solid songwriter,"Patty Griffin is a wonderful songwriter. There are some moments on ""Impossible Dream"" that are almost unbearably emotional. So why only three stars for average? Because while ""Top Of The World,"" ""Kite"" and ""Useless Desires"" are all hits waiting to happen (and in the case of ""Top Of The World,"" The Dixie Chicks already have), but much of the remainder isn't up to the same standard. And why oh why tack the parental duet of ""Impossible Dream"" on the end of ""Top Of The World,"" thus robbing it of its greatest potential impact?There is a great deal of repetition here. I tend to hit the skip button every time ""Standing"" and ""The Rowing Song"" comes up, and only on ""Love Throw A Line"" does the tempo ever kick past dreary. While I am glad the patronage of The Dixie Chicks has given Patty's career a boost, I was hoping for more than down-tempo dirges. You may like this to chill out to, but ""Impossible Dream"" might just put you to sleep."
5,Her music keeps getting better...........,"I am in awe of this woman's talent. With every album she releases I expect I might find a ""recycling"" of what she has produced before, like you get with so many musical artists. I expect to not enjoy the new release as much, but fortunately so far, I have been dead wrong. This album is awesome and I love that she is three dimensional and refuses to yield to producing some tapped out formulated version of her previous releases. The blues/gospel tone to ""Love Throw a Line"" and ""Standing"" is a perfect fit for such a soulful voice. ""When It Doesn't Come Easy"", ""Useless Desires"", and ""Top of the World"" are standouts. Great Album!"
4,Highly recommended,"I have to admit that i've not been a big fan of Patti in the past. Her previous work was a bit ""raw"" for my taste (for example, her voice on ""Moses,"" albeit a fine song, always seemed a bit coarse to me). But ever since a friend gifted me this CD a month ago, it hasn't come out of my player. Her voice is like no other, and she takes it to some stunning places. The songwriting on ""Florida"" offers some lines that are as good as it gets. If there is any weakness to this album, it is perhaps a tad over-produced: ""Don't Come Easy"" would be a truly great song if she lost the back-up horns in favor of fiddle, dobro, harmonica, anything, or even nothing. The horns just don't work. (If you wanna hear a folkie do horns well, check out Michelle Shocked's ""Deep Natural."") But this is only a mild criticism; i'd buy this one in a second if you are even vaguely interested in Patti's work. It's her best yet."
5,One of the best singer song writers,"I think Patty Griffin has incredible talent writing words and music. Of her CDs with which I am acquainted, I would place this one third after Living with Ghosts and 1000 Kisses."
4,repeat 5 times...,"Impossile Dream is Patty's best album yet. As always, the album is lyrically fantastic. Griffin's voice is again stellar, and the production is her most solid yet. Just a fantastic listen. Oh, and in response to Michael E. Chase's review... I can think of at least poet worth his salt that repeats the same word 5 times... Shakespearein King Lear, ""Never. Never. Never. Never. Never."". Now Patty Griffin is no Shakespeare, but she is brilliant. Sometimes one word can say all one needs to say."
2,Ehhhh,"Well, I mean ya its a gundam model kit. If you've ever built one before your well aware of how durable they are. This one looks awesome in the picture, it also has two beam sabers and an assault rifle that come with it. It looks cool when its done, but dont be fooled. It looks way way way better in the picture. The shield has no blue accent on it, and the face has little red like shown.In my opinion it isnt really that bad of a model kit, but thats just it. Its a model kit. Its not for playing with its for show. So if your intentions are to get a model kit to put up on your mantle, splurge a little and get a better one than this."
1,Coleman Self Inflating Pad,Im very disappointed in this product. Its design is to draw air into the chamber as the memory foam expands in the pad. Because of its one air chamber design when you lay on it all the air is forced down to the feet and under your head. No matter how much air is in it the heavy part of the body the torso is always touching the ground below the pad.
4,SingStar Pop Bundle,"The product came quickly, which was great, but the microphones were not packaged as new, but were rather just wrapped up in their cords. Everything has worked fine, so it's all good. My daughter enjoys this immensely!"
4,PRETTY GOOD GLUTEN FREE PASTA,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GLUTEN FREE PASTAS THAT I HAVE TRIED. JUST MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS FOR 10 MINUTES AND TO RINSE WITH COLD WATER.
4,A good book but.....I have a few qualms,"I really hope this wasn't the last one, though I'm sure it is, and I'm sad to see the series go. In some ways, I suppose it was a good way to end off the series, but I really think that Golden could have ended the series better, it leaves you hanging, really, and why do that when the series is OVER??? It nearly drove me insane. The book is one of those FBI books, which I normally do not care much for, but of course, Christopher Golden wrote it and so of course it was good. Brain Trust is slower to start, but it is enticing and an extremely good read. I do have a few qualms with the plot line, or so ""the plague"", seemed almost too far-fetched- no, not far fetched, it was weaker than other Golden books. Even with that, Brain Trust is a good book and you should all read it!"
2,Not a good way to end,"I really liked all the books in this series but this book i didn't like that much. it took a very long time for the book to get into the action, unlike the other books. if this was the end of the series, i think they could have ended it better."
1,The worst book in the world!,This book sucked! It was the worst book in the series. If the series does continue I hope none of them are like this.
3,"Lots of Hype, Some Fun, and Some Dissapointment","Game was way over hyped but isn't every semi-major title these days? I had a lot of fun with the game but once I finished the SHORT story mode I was left with a feeling that I should have waited to rent the game from Hollywood Video. Granted there are things to find, achievments to get all that good stuff on mutiple play throughs, but I could not bring myself to play through more than once. I will be selling the game once I find the time. PLEASE RENT, you won't be dissapointed. It's a fun game but with no multiplayer there is little left after you complete the game."
3,Star Wars: Money Unleashed!,"Besides the few glitches this game is solid, solid waste of money! While the gameplay is easy enough and the graphics were above average, what kills Star Wars: Unleashed is value for your dollar! Seriously, what you are paying for is the graphics and the easier playing action system, if you were paying for the playing value it would be less then a $20.00 game. The story was good, but short and the re-play ability is less then most. I have played KOTOR, KOTOR II and other Lucas Arts games over and over, this really does not have that re-play value, maybe you might play it again in a year. Their is not really too many choices for gamers, making this more of a button smash action game and a short one at that.I saw someone beat the game in 10 hours, I beat it on difficult in less then eight and I am truly dissapointed. This is a renter game, not worth the $60.00 price tag...I would rather re-play KOTOR or KOTOR II!"
3,"Star Wars Epidsode III, 2...","If you've ever played the Star Wars Revenge of The Sith game, you've pretty much played Force Unleased, just another button mashing action game. Its not really bad, but it isn't anything special.Pro'sFun for about 2hours, a pretty solid story, AMAZING Graphics and Sounds, lots of good cameo's with great voice acting, force powers are actually pretty cool. Leveling is kind of cool, but would have like to have seen a more dynamic system. Clothing and saber options that rival Jedi Knight Academy.Con'sFun for about 2hours, Story felt dumbed down and shorted, it feels like an insult, like we don't care about a good solid story we just wanna kill stormtroopers in a thousand different ways. Saber fighting is combo based (yuck, I was hoping for more of a Oblivion or Jedi Knight Academy style) No Multiplayer.Overall I'd say that it is about a 7/10, but it feels like a lot less cause the expectations were soooo high."
3,Not KOTOR by any means,"I'll be honest and say that I only played this game once for a couple of hours or so. I was so completely unimpressed that I didn't want to play any further. I can't comment on the story but I will say that from what I've heard about being Darth Vader's apprentice and so forth, it sounds interesting. However, I couldn't get past the inaccurate aiming and controls. It just felt like I was pressing buttons and aiming with no real ability to choose my target or anything of that nature. You just have to aim in a general direction and hope for the best. I do think that I'm slightly biased since I've played the amazing Knights of the Old Republic, which is, in my opinion, the greatest Star Wars game ever made. This is a good rental, I suppose, but if I could choose again, I definitely wouldn't purchase this game again (the one I did buy has already been traded in)."
4,great graphics and action but...,"wasn't as involved as i thought it would be. the euphoria engine is pretty amazing and how the destructible world is more realistic than other types of destructible environments. anyways, gave it 4 stars because i was expecting more of a kotor gameplay and story line and such. definitely a great game, but less of a rpg than i would've hoped for.great game still.[edit]if i could rewrite this review after i beat it, i would drop this down to a 2 or 3. do not buy the dlc. not worth the money."
1,"Below average rental, for sure.","I don't know how this game has garnered so many positive reviews. It's somewhat fun for an hour or two, but after that the glitches, repetitiveness, and mediocre level design grow too cumbersome for even the Force to save from the bargain bin. Great idea, great marketing, and great franchise, but in the end the game is but a polished turd."
4,Great for my 7year old,Adventures with cool graphicsKeeps my 7year old entertainedHe loves Star Wars and loves this game as well.Recommended
5,Excellent Game,"The game is a classic. The controls do a wide variety of awesome ""force"" actions without becoming incredibly complicated. The game play is challenging, and the story is interesting whether you are fan of the movies or just a casual game-player. I found myself spending hours playing without noticing time passing at all. A must have."
3,Not The Best Star Wars Game,The game has a pretty solid campaign. The only thing that I didn't like about the campaign is that it can become kind of confusing because you can get lost on some of the missions and not know where to go. The graphics are pretty good.
3,Playing Jedi is fun,The opportunity to play out my force fantasies is fun. Game play is interesting enough for a few good sessions but loses luster after a while. Storyline is intriguing for SW fans and provides opportunity to imagine a unique slice of the Lucas Universe.
3,More of a rent if you're hardcore.,A lot of fun. Great story and great leveling. However if you play as much as I do then this game won't last you very long. Might have been better of renting it because once you hit 100% completion there isn't much bringing you back.
3,pretty good but...,it was a pretty decent game and the game finished at a pretty good spot. but i think the story needed a little more imagination. Lucas arts is definitely starting to run out of ideas for the storyline. i've played a lot of star wars games and i don't know how many times i've had to go to kashyyyk to save chewie or something. that being said it was interesting to finally see how this part of the timeline played out. the main part of the game did give a bit of new story.
3,A better offering for Star Wars fans than the last 3 movies.,"Alright I am just getting straight to the point. The graphics and detail are amazing. The presentation and sound are in the traditional flavor of the movies. The voice acting and dialogue are surprisingly good. On the downside, there are some really ugly camera glitches especially when you walk next to a wall. As a game, I'd say it was slightly above average. As a Star Wars experience I would most definitely rank it far superior to the last 3 films.60 bucks is a bit steep. When it comes down to 35 or so grab it immediately."
1,This game is broken,"The game looks great, a Star Wars fan's dream. The story is almost fitting for the Star Wars Universe....BUT you will die alot, I mean alot. This is not for the game being hard...NO it's for the gameplay to be broken. You can tell the developers rushed this one! The glitchy deaths, the uneven platforming and oh and there's a part were the game gives you the wrong instructions! It seems no testing was done during post production. Pass on this one, maybe a rent only if your hard core into Star Wars. You will be mad playing this game. Thumbs way down."
1,Just another dumb hack and slash game.,I got this game because I read that it was a fun game with a great story. There was pretty much no story and very frustrating game play. A slinky is more entertaining than this failure of a game and a slinky doesn't make you throw the controller through the tv screen.
4,Outstanding game for any Star Wars fanboy,"I almost didn't buy this game, opting to wait for a later discount due to the poor reviews this title is getting. Then I had a weak moment on the way home from work when my Star Wars fanboyism took over. Before I had a chance to recover, I was walking away from a cash register with The Force Unleashed in hand.After playing the first few levels, I'm very glad I bought it. The storyline seems like it will live up to the hype (and this is actually the one positive point on which the negative reviews seem to agree), and I'm still not tired of throwing TIE fighters at people.The one problem I see coming is that the gameplay will likely get fairly repetitive. As long as the storyline stays strong, I can handle that and enjoy the overall experience.This isn't going to compete for best game of the year in any category, but it's a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,"I was not going to even bother with this game from the reviews it was getting. Boy was I wrong! The Force Unleashed lives up to every expectation and more. I love Star Wars and love every part of the story that I don't get to see in a movie. This is a whole new chapter in the Star wars story. So you will love it just for that. But, thats not even the half of it. The game is a 5 out of 5 in every category except for the camera angles. Sometimes the camera doesn't let you see your opponent when facing a boss. Other than that this game is flawless. You know what you can do in this game so I won't repeat that. I bought this game at half price but, I would gladly pay the sticker price for this game. Get this game. You won't be sorry!"
3,Not great,It had a story and the cut scenes where beautiful but it it not much more than a repetitive button masher. I was hoping for KOTOR meets Jedi Knight but it did not even come close. If not for the Star Wars name I doubt anyone would have noticed this game. It did add to the story of what happened between Epsiode 3 and 4 but it took several hours of game play to see a story that would have been a very short book. I am an old school LucasArts fan (they made incredible games) and had hoped KOTOR was a revival of sorts but this was not worth $60 to play.
4,"Fun, but a little short","Had fun playing, but it was over way to quickly. Some of the boss or larger battles are reduced to hitting one of the four letter buttons at the correct time, so that can get kinda repetitive. Overall, I had a fun time with it and since I got it as a gold box deal the price was right."
4,Become a Jedi,"A fun game. Only complaints are your character takes forever to recover after being hit and the enemy might be throwing its next attack while you're still getting up and all you can do is watch your health drain. Also, the cut scenes could have been rendered more professionally."
3,alright,"i wanted a 3rd person action game, so i bought this for 10 used at gamestop, and the sequel for 20 new with some trade in credit i had. this game is fun, but the controls are only okay and the gameplay feels a bit clunky at times. i played on easy to warm up for the force unleashed 2.. and beat it in 4 hours.. short and disappointing. at least it was fun.6.5/10"
2,Not Really Much Fun,There is not really much I like about this game. Very repetitive hack and slash. The controls are sloppy. The camera angle is mostly hideous. The story is OK. My son who loves watching me play video games will ask me to turn it off after about ten min or so becuase he gets bored watching me do the same things over and over... I would pass on this one.
1,It's craptastic!,"I agree with many of the other lackluster reviews, in that this game feels very unpolished, and buggy. The graphics are nice (barring the occasional texture flickering) but thats about it. I highly reccomend borrowing this game or renting it before you buy. I haven't played the demo, but I'm guessing if you've played the demo, you've pretty much played the entire game. Total waste of money."
2,Extremely Frustrating !!!,"I only play a couple of hours a week, and enjoy games such as the Halo series, Gears of War and Mass Effect and this is what I have to say about this game. Cool force powers, good graphics and you get to see characters from the movies thats about it. The story is weak, the game play is repetitive and boring,the camera is horrible, fix the damn camera!!!!. I keep getting jumped from behind, I have to run in circles to see who is attacking me. Fix the damn Camera or add a Radar that makes sense. When you get to fight in enclosed spaces the camera gets so close you cant even see yourself, your attackers or what you are doing and then you end up killed or at the bottom of a cliff. Its really hard for me to undestand how can it take years to develop a game and still miss the basics this game in my opinion is garbage. I was looking forward to the release of this game and even pre-order it, so like the previous reviewer I am pissed !!!"
5,Star Wars Money Well Spent!,"While some people may say that this game is glitchy, I don't know what they are talking about. This game works perfectly. The levels never get old and it is always fun to push the stormtroopers around. The only thing I will criticize is the difficulty level you chose. I always pick the lowest one because if you try higher difficulty then the people your fighting don't get harder, your health just goes down faster than with the lower difficulty. But still this the most fun of the Star Wars games. I cant wait to throw the stormtroopers around more so I'm cutting this short. I highly recommend this game. You will not be sorry if you buy this."
4,Star Wars: The Force Unleashed,"This game was fun and had great action and cool powers, but was too short."
4,Good Game,"One of the better Star Wars games out there imo, not a fan of the whole cheat codes thing though."
4,The game,This games meet all of mind expectations and it is a lot of fun tp play by everyone. I bought the game for my grandson and he just loves the game.
3,"It's a good game, but it could have been a lot better","This game is fun. I'll give it that. But I can't give it any more than three stars due to some critical failures on the part of the developers.First of all, the loading times are absolutely ridiculous. If you die, you have to wait 45 seconds for the scene to reload. If you want to check out your character's stats, you have to wait 45 seconds for the menu to load. And then you have to wait 45 more seconds once you want to leave the menu. I felt that these features seriously cut into the playability of the game.But the biggest flaw is the jerky play control. Over half of my deaths were the result of me losing control of my character.But there has to be some saving grace because I made it all the way through the game. Hence, it gets three stars."
4,"Great game, really bad ending.","I wont give away the ending, but it was very disapointing... Play this game for all that's there on the way to the ending. Picking up guys and throwing them while they struggle is SO COOL! But man they should have worked a little longer on the ending. I would strongly recomend this game but plan on being disapointed at the end..."
3,Meh,PROS:1. Good story.2. Beautiful graphics.3. Cool Force moves.CONS:1. Repetitive hack & slash gameplay.2. Awful camera angles.3. Boring level design.4. Short (7-10 hours).5. Easy boss battles.6. Mentally challanged enemy AI.7. Too many bugs.
2,"If you can't figure out camera angle, stop making games...","Oh where to begin.First off, the good. It has a decent storyline. Not bad, not good. Decent. The end.Now for the bad. The camera angle is frustrating. The game tries for these grandiose wide shots where your character is just a wee speck. Many times, you can't even see your character. As you fly around the same couple of levels (they repeat over and over again), if you get too close to anything, you can no longer see your character.Also, the game doesn't have a targeting mechanic. Your moronic apprentice can be getting his bottom handed to him, but he will continue to fire lightning this way and that. The game has a targeting mechanic, but it doesn't work.You have to play through the game once to get the decent skills (or have any skill points put into them).This game is worth about [...]. I wouldn't (and am glad I didn't) pay more than that."
2,"More like ""Star Wars: force LEASHED.""","I have many fond memories of the great star wars titles lucas arts released in the 90s and thought I would give this one a try. As it turns out maybe I should have stayed in that coma for another 10 years. That way I could have not only missed the prequels, but this ill-fated title. This game could be single-handedly ruined by it's poor targeting system, except for the help of other issues that created a multi-faceted ensemble of suck. I love the star wars expanded universe as much as the next guy but jawas that use the force, seriously? It's unclear how to beat the bosses and the game forces you to memorise combos in an unnecessaryly complex fighting system. All in all I paid 10 bucks for the game and it was probably worth it, but it's not worth my time and effort to play to completion."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This game produces mixed feelings for me. I like Star Wars quite a bit, but this game has the Lucas Arts rushing to get to production feeling to it.THE GOOD:Visuals, visuals, visuals. Many of the visuals in the game are outstanding. From the cutscenes to the places in the storyline itself, the player feels like he is in the SW universe. The voice acting is quite good as well. The music is good but can be repetitive at times.THE BAD:Gameplay. I felt like was taken back to the 1990s. Way, way too much jumping from ledges, especially where everything had to be timed so absolutely perfectly. Then, invariably the player falls and has to start all over. That could be incredible frustrating at times. The game also uses many of the same planets twice, and the coolest levels are often the shortest. I'd rather have a longer Cloud City and a much shorter Felucia.Finally, this game is quite fun, don't get me wrong, but it's no KOTOR."
3,Not a bad adventure game,"The game was a decent amount of fun, but I wish it was a tad longer. Standard achievements, killing x amount with y ability and complete z level on medium/hard/superhard. The gameplay got a little repetitive but it was fun using the force powers to kill tons of enemies at once. The boss fights are probably the best part of the game since they are all unique and can become quite challenging. After I beat it, I immediately put it on Goozex for its trade value since I know that I will never play it again. It only has replay value if you want to get all of the achievements. I really would have liked to see some sort of multiplayer, either co-op missions or even deathmatch/ctf.If you are a star wars fan, then it is well worth playing, but after you've gotten the story from it, it's not worth keeping around. My opinion is to rent it instead of buy."
4,Fun adventure filled game.,This was a fun game to play when I didn't feel like concentrating very hard or really being challenged. It's a nice hack and slash. I had a lot of fun with the force powers.
4,Be the Sith!,"Ever want to be Darth Vader? Use the Force to throw Stormtroopers? Now you can!Star Wars: The Force Unleashedlets you play as a Dark Jedi and you kill anyone and anything in your way. I haven't had this much fun with a Star Wars game since Dark Forces.I think some of the other reviewers are right in that the game controls are awkward - particularly those bloody camera angles. I did take a star down for that. However, I haven't found it too difficult so far. It just takes a bit of getting used to. I spent some time in the training room first. There are a lot of force moves (my favorite so far is simply throwing objects at people.However, I don't think the criticism about it being too easy is justified. I think the point of an easier game is to let casual gamers play as well. The game does have different levels, so if Padawan is too easy, you can try Sith Lord difficulty.For the price,Star Wars: The Force Unleashedis a good deal of fun."
3,Great game!11!,"This is one of the greatest games ever made not.. Well i cant say that really. At first when you play it it rocks!!!!!! But after like 2- 3 hours. Blech. Its like the only purpose of you is to pwn storm troopers. Way too easy. It's also easy because i can get like 500 life points from killing one storm trooper. So its pretty hard to die sometimes. Some places are like really easy but some wow... freakin hard! I am also pretty sad when i bought this because i had big expectations for this and wow it kinda sucks i rate 6.5/10. Oh yeah one other thing it is laggy! I was killing darth vader and he was like 1 more hit till he dies. Then boom darth vader becomes invinsible and just stands there and you cant hit him at all!Pros: Great graphics, fun game for a little, GREAT !!! STORY Over all its fine!Cons: Gets really boring. Laggy or glitchy or just has a lot of glitches. Way too easy. No multiplayer. And did i mention it loads SO SLOWLY! It takes like a minute to load!"
4,"Along time ago history, let the Force blow your mind","A good Star wars History, excelent phisycs engine, good cinematics and a intuitive gameplay are the principal mix elements that compouse the new game-chapter of Star Wars saga, I dont'n like the cgi model of Darth Vader, because is like animated action figure. The combat style of the main character is awesome, but the best is the use of force porwers, reaally you can feel the force, I found this game similar in some aspects to Jedi Outcast Video Game, Send some dollars in this game."
1,Worst Plot contrivance since Palpatine Created the Seperatist Movement in the prequels,"Palpatine Creates the Rebellion. This is the worst thing George Lucas has ever done to star wars next to creating Jar Jar, or not releasing the original films restored in anamorphic DVD releases.The hack and Slash is fun for about a single play for a few hours then gets boring. Rip Off of god of war just not as good.Starkiller a throw away cardboard character. The emperor's voice over was bad as was darth vaders. The rest of the cast was good to excellent. The graphics of course are stunning as well as the environments.Leia looks hot in this game and Jimmy Smitts voices Bail still not enough to sell a game. Juno Eclipse also was a hottie in this game, still the game deserves zero stars for its plot."
2,Mediocre @ Best,"Pros:Star Wars gamebeautiful graphicsCons:Horrible, non-adjustable camera angles on every levelrepetitive game playClaim of RPG leveling element is rudimentary and basically stolen from previous Star Wars games from Xbox daysMediocre controls, but requires you to finely manipulate your character and objects-- VERY FRUSTRATING!There is a sequence in-game that gives you faulty instructions and would be very lame and repetitive even without bad instructions.The story is lame"
2,"Buggy, but great story","it is a great story, with fun (though extremely simple) gameplay. The disk I had froze 2/3rd of the play through. I have spoken to a few people and a lot of them had several bugs directly tied to their disks. Having said that, if you do find a ""working"" disk you will enjoy the story."
2,Lame,"Lame. The word to describe this waste of your time and money. The story is lame, and at times will make you cringe. The game play is lame as you seem to do the same thing over and over and over again. There are far better Star Wars video games. There is no creative aspect to this game. Yes, there are some cool force powers, but KOTOR had that. The story confuses several pre-New Hope story lines, and has nothing to offer other than another example of how Lucasarts cares only for sales."
3,buyer beware,"This goes to all you who was just like me. I couldnt wait to get this game. Well I finall got it today, and I was in for a big shock. First the graphics were awesome. The controls were ok. And the story was good, although not very star wars accurate. The two biggest problems I had was the use of the force powers and the length of the game. The powers were very limited, with a very linnear character progression. The length was a big issue. The game is completed in about 8 hours, since it to is a very linear game. Can't go anywhere but straight ahead. All in all it was a decent game, but definately not worth the wait or the hype. Rent it first"
2,"fun starwars, but way too little game for a lot of money.","I think this game is a good buy at 29.00. or less, but not $60. The reason is that the game is nothing really detailed or depth to it. It is running around killing anything that moves and moving on to the next mission. Although you can customize the abilities, they do not seem to make that much of a difference. As you go you unlock more abilities that make for more fun ways of killing the opponents, but even then, it is just more of the same. The game is very linear, and not that imaginative for a star wars game. You really just do not feel your a jedi any more than you feel your the god of war, since they both feel much the same, except this one has a light saber, and only half as good.In short, your money is better spent buying God Of War for less than half the price, and get more game."
1,broken,"i loved the game played it before so i decided to order it.so i did, but when it arrived and i took the disc out to check and see if their was any scratches. what do you know theres a huge scratch on it so i think to myself ""oh well maybe it will work anyways"" and when i put it in the xbox it says this disc is unreadable. so i email the guy and he says ""sorry the game is sold as is"" but when i bought the game it didnt say ""SOLD AS IS"" anywere.so over all i give this duechbag a 0 out of 10 and will never being buying from this seller ever again."
3,M'eh Adequate Game,"This game is OK. The Story was pretty good, the graphics are very good. I like that you can interact with so many things in the environment. Powers could have been better - you'll just end up throwing lightning the whole game because anything else is weak. Ok for $15 - wouldn't pay more than that."
3,"Good, but rent it-- don't buy it","When I first started playing, I liked it. As I continued-- I loved it. The controls were easy to get used to and you got a real sense of power from killing people with force grip.However, it gets boring within a few hours. It's very repetitive and, when it comes down to it, there really aren't that many force powers to 'unleash'. I found myself sticking to Lightening and force grip the entire game. Force push was just about useless and I rarely ever even used force repulse.It's a good game to rent over a weekend, but I really wouldn't recommend it."
1,Unfinished,"The game has the feel of being half done. The refined parts that take it from being good to being great are not there. You fight with the controls more than you do with the enemies. All the fun elements are there, but without the solidity of something developed all the way through. You'll have many hours of frustration trying to get the character to aim at the right thing. The targeting is weak, the character building is awkward, and the save points land oddly.All in all, a good concept with fun aspects that needed another few months to work the bugs out."
2,Overly complicated button masher,"This game is a pretty typical button masher action game. However, as you progress, you have to think quite a bit about how you wish to spend points to specialize your character. For me, this took away from the button mashing fun as the abilities I gained did not feel different enough to be interesting."
3,Force it,It is like most Star Wars games. The problem I have with the game is that it takes forever to load anything. Overall the game is fairly decent but I am glad I bought it used and not full price otherwise I would be mad that I spent so much money.
3,"At first amazing, then good, then boring.","The game starts out fresh and 'unleashed'. But then every level repeats itself. The game is extremely scripted, meaning replayability is not high. Graphics are good. Force powers are good. Storyline is decent. Gameplay is fun, then terrible."
2,DISAPPOINTING,I was really looking forward to this game and the demo was good on live but the overall game play is just bad. The story is good but the game play and level up are bad. There's alot of spots where you just get stuck and can't find where to go or how to shut off laser fields. I'm sick of buying strategy guides so my advice is to wait and buy a used copy and get the guide or save your money there are alot of cool games coming out this fall.
1,The force unfocused and kind of all over the place...,Sloppy Sloppy Sloppy Controls and the absolute worst camera ever absolutely kill any fun that could be had with this one.
1,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Lucasarts and Star Wars for more than a decade. The Jedi Knight series was one of the best video game franchises ever created.If you were hoping for a fun, quality game stay away from this.If you are a fan of bland level design, complicated button mashing combos, pathetic story lines, and stupid enemies - get this game.I found that this game only reminded me of far better games, and ultimately made me wish I had never bought it in the first place."
3,"Fun, but short gameplay saga.","This game is a lot of fun, but there are not enough levels. Also it doesn't have the same feel of being in a large world that you would want from a game like this. The fighting is awesome and wrecking storm troopers is well worth it, but don't dig too deep! You wont find much depth."
4,Loca de Amor,Ola! Don't understand Spanish or the lyrics. But Barbara can shake her maraccas for me anyday. Up tempo songs and good arrangements.
1,How was this published?,"I don't understand how this book/series was published. Weak character development and poorly written. I'm struggling to finish it. The subject matter has great potential, but unfortunately it hasn't reached it here."
2,Seriously silly,"The story is seriously silly and filled with clinches. It's pretty clear the author didn't plan out the plot or the story, and was making it up sloppily as he went."
2,Not all that great.,"In the hands of a James Rollins or a Matthew Reilly, the story could have been fantastic. In the hands of this author, it's just kind of ""eh"". The writing is rather generic and bland, with little feeling behind the action. In fact, it often feels like he's summarizing the action rather than actually showing it! Plus, the female lead character was a totally obnoxious bee-yotch. I hope the sequel is better!"
2,Raising Atlantis - Thomas Greanias,"Greanias' novel started well for me, but stretched a bit too far by the end of the story. I liked the characters, but found the parentage plot twist (no specifics to avoid spoiling the book!) a bit hard to swallow. The descriptions of the city and Antarctic were great, and I would read another of his novels in the future, in hopes that he doesn't jump off the proverbial cliff with the plot! I gave it 2 out of 5 stars, as it isn't bad, but there are better novels out there with this type of plot."
1,Cussler Wannabe,"As a Cussler fan, I was encouraged by his favorable comments of this book, so I plunged in. Having just read one of Cussler's first works, Iceberg, the comparison to this one is absurd. Read one of Cussler's books to see how it should be done. Given this is the author's first work, I will give him a break, since I could never write one. On the other hand, if I had the author's connections and friends, who knows. One dimensional characters, poor writing, etc. are excusable, but getting to the end of a book and going, 'huh?' is the most frustrating. I completely lost the plot and was totally confused by the end. Who were the Atlanteans, what's the deal with the space travel, did the Atlanteans intentionally cause continental drift and why, the connections to Jesus??. It just got confusing and absurd. Add on top, not one likeable or believable character. It was a quick read though. Good to pass time on an airplane. Thank goodness for Dirk Pitt."
3,ICE ESCAPADES,"Following in the footsteps of THE DAVINCI CODE, the Catholic Church takes another hit in this over the top thriller in which the author posits that the continent of Antarctica just might be harboring the lost continent of Atlantis.One cannot deny the innovative theories of author Grenanias as he puts his antiheroes, Dr. Conrad Yeats and former nun Serena Sarengetti into numerous death defying sequences. The narrative moves smoothly and the imperfections of his two protagonists plus the other supporting players makes for an intriguing read. It's all pretty fantastic, but in suspending belief, you can find yourself getting caught up in the impending catastrophic events. A follow up, THE ATLANTIS PROPHECY, is due out this fall featuring Dr. Conrad Yeats."
1,"If you love ""Atlantis"" subject matter don't waste your money on this book.","I am always looking for books about ""Atlantis"". This onehas been really a let-down. I read the first 100 pages looking for a character that I could connect with. Conrad (hero?) is a whiney, ungrateful man who deserves everything he gets. Serena (heroine?) is an undesireable character who is strident, elitist and so full of herself you wonder why she hasn't been appointed ""Qeen of the World"". Oh yeah, she HAS been designated ""Mother Earth"".The book has derogatory comments about the military, big business, and Pharmaceuticals and last but not least ""AMERICA"". I wished that I had read the author's bio which was a warning for the unnecessary political slant that makes the story-tellingunconvincing and frankly, boring."
1,Dreck and Drivel,"There were at least ten sentences in the 1/3 of the book that I managed to gag down that could have been submitted to the Bulwer-Lytton bad writing contest. I don't know from Science Fiction, but good SyFy is well written. Not so this cow pattie."
1,Gimme a break. What trash.,"This thing is so full of holes they may as well have called it Raising Swiss Cheese. I've also read it before, and much better back in February when it was called Decipher by Stel Pavlou. This book reads like someone read that and decided to rush out a bad copy. Shameless!"
4,Hooks You From Page One,"I picked up Raising Atlantis and couldn't put it down. The premise, the characters, the action and the ending were fabulous. I felt like an angel had taken me by the hand and whisked me up a long dark tunnel to the light. A great ride and lots of fun. Like most great rides I felt it was too short. I'm saving my last star for the sequel."
1,Boooorrringgggggg......,"I initially thought this would be a really good book. Right up my alley. I heard the author on Coast to Coast with George Noory and since I am interested in this type of subject anyway I figured I'd read a fiction novel. I usually stick to non-fiction.Big mistake. What a waste of reading time. The first half of the book was mostly a big conversation with nothing much happening. I kept reading, hoping it would get better. It got worse. The second half of the book didn't make any sense. The author tries to describe the surroundings but does such a poor job it just ends up confusing the reader. This book was so bad that I didn't even bother to read the last few pages.That's right. I wasted all that time on reading the whole book only to put it down before finishing the last few pages. What does that tell you?Bad book, bad story, poorly written. Don't waste your money."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"Raising Atlantis was the worst book I've read in a long time. The first half had some interesting ideas, but then things got ridiculous. I enjoy reading action adventure novels by authors like Clive Clusser and James Rollins but Raising Atlantis was a complete waste of time and money and I won't be reading anything by Thomas Greanias again."
2,almost unreadable,"This book is almost unreadable. I remember Mr. Hanania's work in the Southtown Economist and the Chicago Sun-Times; he apparently had some very good editors. The stories are, at times, interesting, as when he talks about his childhood; most of the time, however, they are pretty annoying. The book suffers mostly from a serious lack of proofreading; also, most of the stories could benefit from a decent editor."
5,Jungle Talk toys,Very pleased with overall ease of ordering. Product arrived in original packaging and was as advertised. Received within two days of ordering. Would definitely order from this vendor again.
2,Beware: This book has errors,"I haven't used this book much so I can't speak for it's overall quality. I would like to point out a significant error in the text which calls that quality into question. On page 363 it is stated that ""A custom suppied constructor does not allocate memory"" which is false. It also goes on to give an example which uses a constructor just for initializing an already existing object. An ordinary procedure would sufficed for this. In other words the author missed the point of the constructor keyword: it allows for custom methods which both create and initialize objects."
1,Buy a different book.,"This Book, while covering a lot of ground only touches on each subject. The writing style is very terse, and generally left me more confused about a subject than before I began. In short, I found the delphi manuals more helpful"
5,It was a lifesaver!,"I used this book on a recent vacation trip and found that I kept it with me all the time. For the first time in my life, I not only got to my destination with everything I needed, but I also returned home with everything I was supposed to! Using the book helped me get where I needed to go when I needed to get there. It really kept me on track, which isn't easy!"
5,Thanks for a great product!,Your book continued to be heaven sent throughout our entire vacation! It fit perfectly in the pouch of one of the pieces I carried most places.
5,Perfect fit,"I have problem feet and have tried every brand and have purchased very expensive insoles. These shoes were a perfect fit, no need for the custom insoles and the arch support was perfect. Although expensive, better than buying pair after pair and none of them fitting ."
3,Not as good as the leather ones,"I also own the leather ones in this style, and I love them. But the quality in the ""croc"" leather is just not the same. I would buy the shoes again in the leather, but never in this ""croc""."
4,"Hazards of being Royal, Oh my!","A good read, it kept me interested but I did not care for this book as much as Jeanne Kalogridis', ""I, Mona Lisa"".Dysfunctional is too kind a word for the Borgia family."
2,Don't Know What Went Wrong,"This is the only historical fiction novel I have not been able to finish. As a lover of historical fiction I don't know what went wrong, I just simply didn't like it. Maybe in few years when my memory of it has become very hazy I will try again, only because of the opulent amount of positive reviews."
4,Good read...,"I bought this book a couple weeks before Christmas. I picked it up because 1) I wanted something to read and 2) I wasn't sure if I'd get the 2 Philipa Gregory novels I wanted for Christmas.The Borgia Bride was good, grasped me at first, and then in parts of it I lost interest. But towards the last 100-150 pages I couldn't put it down again. I'd recommend reading it."
2,Not what you think,"My issue is NOT with the people that I purchased this book, but with the book itself. When I initially looked at it, it seemed like an interesting story and though it does have its highlights, over all I would not recommend this book to anyone nor would I read it again."
3,Good Summer Reading,"If you're looking for a good book to read on a plane--one that you can pick up, be engrossed in and then quickly forget about--then this is the book for you. The book may have some historical facts in it, but it's really just a romance novel with some historical facts thrown in for good measure. Is it enjoyable for what it is? Yes. Are you going to forever remember this book as a pinnacle of fiction? No, but it's a nice diversion nonetheless."
4,Good read,I read this book because I wanted to find out more about the Borgias because of their popularity right now with the HBO series. It was very instructing with a good story line and even though this book is fiction now I have a better understanding of the Borgias. I would recommend this book to any one who wants read about deception in the 1400's Europe.
3,meh...,The way she writes is really cheesy and that really messed with how the book flowed. It was entertaining but I only finished it because I had hope it would get better...
3,Good Read - Poor Punctuation,"Very well written and presented. The story is engrossing and captivating, the only problem that I had was the less than standard spelling and punctuation of the product. I found myself distracted from the story by intentionally searching for misspelled and mispunctuations. I found over ninety (90) after I started logging them on my Kindle.This is one of the first works that I have read on my new Kindle. So it is difficult to determine if the errors were from the transmission of the book or the poor proof reading by the publishing firm.I would, however, recommend this book."
1,Boring.,"Sorry folks. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The only interesting thing about it is the dreadful editing of the Kindle edition. How I long for a red marker!! Sancha is wooden and unsympathetic. Unsympathetic would be acceptable if she were only interesting but she's not. This era is a facsinating period of history but you won't get that from this book. It's just dull, dull, dull."
2,Disappointed,"Having recently read The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory and The Birth of Venus by by Sarah Dunant, I was very much disappointed in this novel by Jeanne Kalogridis. It does not match the complexity of plot, character or style found in the other two works of historical fiction about women; its badly written, graphic love scenes diminish it even more."
5,Great Book,"Very entertaining story, a great read for anyone who is into reading about the renaissance era or medieval time period."
1,Back to the Future,"""The show was horrible and may have set MMA back several years. If EliteXC's future was really riding on this show, then they should be going bankrupt soon."" - mushemush"
5,Responding to Jeffery,"I'm glad you like the band and this ablum, but as far as Guy Evans being just moderatly competent your showing very little knowledge of drumming. While he may not be as tight as Bill Bruford, he makes playing in odd meters with multiple changes look effortless in the DVD. Just being able to play this music is worth more than that. Also Jackson plays some of the most creative sax and devices I've ever heard. Your review just seemed like a backhanded compliment to me."
2,He to H Who - waa??,"Alright, something to do with helium. Maybe Peter Hammill was sniffing it when he sang this stuff. I find he's way over the top, chewing the scenery on every song. He ranks with Richard Harris for over-acting. The songs themselves are pretty boring, not much going on. Would be a total waste if not for Fripp's short guitar solo on one song. I listened to this a few times and sold it on eBay. This is not the great missing piece of the progressive rock puzzle. Too melodramatic. There's not much instrumentally, just hammond organ everywhere, like wallpaper, and some adequate woodwinds. Not much in the way of arrangements either. The songs are too long considering their simplicity. Put in some electric guitar - it's all Hammill's acoustic other than Fripp - and maybe this would do more than make you want to shut your eyes - impossible to sleep though due to Hamill's constant emoting. However, if you are depressed or enjoy being depressed, this may be the album for you."
4,VERY GOOD BUT NOT AN IMPROVEMENT,"This is a very good Greek grammar, but it is not better than the second edition. The second edition is visually laid out better. The second edition noun and verb chart layouts at the end of the book are visually easier to read.The third edtion should have followed the second edition layout and outline more closely.The practise exercises and examples are excellent in the third edition.The vocabulary layout in the back of the third edition is better than the second edition.I would say that the third edition may need the help of a teacher more than the second edition.I learned from the second edition and may be prejudiced.Conclusion: The new third edition is better than any other grammar I have read but it is not better than the second edition. They are both excellent.Combine the best features of both editions and you would have a five star book.(...)"
4,Good for breaking the ice,"This book was a good idea for helping the beginning Greek student break the ice and get started in New Testament Greek grammar. I think that in order to get the most out of this book, it would be a good idea to supplement with Mounce's BBG. Together, these books will help the student to learn and retain. I believe that including accents would have helped since you will have to know how they work and operate later on in study, however, the claim of this book is mainly how to begin reading in the NT."
5,"Excellent, well-organized textbook","This book is much more straightforward and easier to use than the more common textbook by Mounce. It is presented in a well-organized fashion, starting with simple sentences, and gradually adding cases, declensions, conjugations and other difficulties. Every new topic is accompanied by practice problems, many of which are simplified (or non-simplified) sentences taken from the New Testament.The CDs are not useful; the book stands on its own without them."
2,Suited for Those Completely Unfamiliar with Queuing,"The information publicly available on MQSeries covers the information as well as this work. It is however, suitable for those considering the appropriateness and construction of MQSerier for their project who are completely unfamiliar with the topic."
3,Good reference book for beginers and intermediate users,you'd get information about the Matlab programming
1,"Cheaply made, small and worthless...","I ordered this ocarina as a gift based on the prior reviews. Unfortunately, I was disappointed, as the ocarina couldn't even play a note. When blowing into the ocarina, all you hear is air. When holding down a hole, more air. The overall feel of the ocarina felt cheap as well. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,"cheap,but really fun",I think its really fun but cheap. I have always have wanted an ocarina. i did not know how cool and fun it would be so i got this one. if you want a really good one get one thats less cheap one. for beginers its fine.
2,Its really not the zelda one *sigh* i wish it sounded good,"its alright but you know, its airy get another one cause its not the one you think it is. it sounds like a fweeeeoooaw when it gets to high notes......but........i cant stand it so im getting a clay er wodden one for christmas if not, well then, ugh i dont like it i wish i could sell it but, it has paint marks inside, anyone wanna buy mine huh? ......please......if not go ask friends ...........cuz yeah..... it needs a good cleaning....well the paint is washable any one want mine! the ocarina of time is better........but yeah.....good luck.......*sigh* ocarina of time..........fairy ocarina........."
1,Complete rip off. not as advertised,My son purchased this one because of the picture. He could have purchased from another vendor and payed less for the same piece of crap.... What a joke. Don't waste your money...
1,GARBAGE,"This is the most biggest piece of garbage i have ever owned, the plastic is cheap and it almost impossible to make one good sounding not on thing. i knew it was cheap but wow, if you are wanting a starter ocarina i recommend getting a clay one, they sonund nice..it may be bulky and u might not be able to carry in your pocket but its worth it"
3,Neat for the kids.,"If you're an adult buying this as a serious instrument, think again. This is a great musical toy for a child, though. You get what you pay for, and you're paying for a whistle made of plastic.Honestly, I do like it, and my son (4 years old) plays around on it all the time. He's not making music, yet, but it is quiet enough that it's not exactly bothersome."
4,Fantastic Zatoichi Films but no Inserts or Cards/Posters,"I bought the first Zatoichi film, ""The Tale of Zatoichi."" I really enjoyed the film and was impressed with the extras-an insert with an essay written by a Zatoichi freak and a set of 4 Collector's Cards. When I saw this set of 4 films I was overjoyed and I bought it. However I was a little disappointed to discover that this set has only the disks with no cards or inserts. Is there any way to get the inserts or collector's cards now? According to reviews I've read of the individual films they all included them.The movies themselves rate 5 stars. But I'll dock the sets one star each for the missing inserts and cards."
3,Not as good as Volumes 1-4,"Volume 1 especially was good. Even through volume 4 was good. I had high hopes for this set. However, the story line/plots just weren't as compelling as the first 4. For an example, volume 1 has a renown samurai who has developed a terminal illness meeting Zatoichi while fishing and get to admire each other and become friends before finding out that they each are staying at opposing lords' homes who are about to go to war with each other. The samurai and Ichi end up dueling at the request of the samurai who knows that his days are numbered and didn't want to end his life at the hands of scoundrels but by someone he admired like Ichi. Ichi was humble while menacing throughout the 4 volumes. However, from volume 4 the movies start out with scenes of Ichi in action killing several men while telling them witty stuff. I felt that the character had changed a bit. Out of volumes 4-7, volume 7 had a compelling storyline. The others were just drawn out TV show in quality."
3,"Zatoichi, the blind Samauri","I spent time in Japan a long time ago and used to watch Zatoichi on the television then. This is a story much like the American western movies. We have our hero, who always comes into town to investigate the bad guys. He works around gathering information on all the bad things happening in this town. Then he challenges the usual gang of evil doers. And finally he does in the leader of the gang and rids the town of evil forever. Everyone loves him, and he leaves.AND, just like our western heros, he does all sorts of wonderful things with his skills. Zatoichi is a Samauri, a swordsman of the upmost skills. Although blind, he had honed his skills and hearing to a point he is nearly invincible. Of course, he is terribly outnumbered in every encounter. BUT, good triumphs over evil, and everyone lives happily every after and the good guy's daughter gets the ryokan back and all is well in the end. Predictable, but fun."
3,Fun to Browse,"What we have here is a typical Time-Life pop-history book. Poorly researched, strewn with errors and superficial commentary but tons of great photos. The picture of the James gang is bogus, however. It's fun to look at but little more."
4,"The Jazz, Fusion, Holdsworth Gong Album","I heard of Gong and although I thought they were o.k., I gave up on them. I then heard that this second or third period of Gong is fusion mixed, I heard it and immediately bought it. Gong up to the mid 70's were spacey, trippy, strange vocals and I enjoyed that but was not crazy over them. The Gazeuse period is fantastic fusiony jazz featuring Holdsworth at his best, all instrumental as well as a focus on the vibes. This album was originally called Expresso in the U.K. and in the States titled Gazeuse. The next album is also killer, titled Expresso II which feautures more of the same but with a heavier emphasis on the glock/vibes. Gazeuse is a classic on par with Bruford's solos. If you have not heard this side of Gong, you better hear this one!!!"
5,HYPNOTIC! ease into it and enjoy.,"if you are reading this review,I am prepared to assume youhave at least a passing interest in high quality,well recordedjazz fusion.If I am correct,this may be one of your new favorite albums.This was my personal first experience with giving GONGa good listen.It will not be my last.This effort is a crisp,cleanmix of heavy guitar leads,mellow vibe-like sounds fromthe keyboard instruments,and top notch jazz percussion.Many of the GONG recordings have vocals on them--this disk is all instrumental.Features Alan Holdsworth on guitar instead of Steve Hillage.He does not miss a beat.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.this is a very worthwhileexpenditure of your entertainment $."
4,Fusiony Instrumentals.,"Well. First off, there's none of that PHP silliness on this record. I really miss that. Fusiony stuff generally takes itself too seriously and without any fun going on even on the periphery it kinda wrecks my tea. It's very good stuff mostly, but they sound a little lashed to the task--just an opinion--don't curse my dead Mother. For a few of these cuts (Holdsworth) I thought I was hearing a Mahavishnu disc and ultimately, you know how much fun those guys had. So even though there were POT-HEADS present they were way cleaned up and ultimately, you know how much fun that can be."
2,Gong - 'Gazeuse' (Caroline) 2 1/2 stars,"First off, this is NOT the Gong that many of us have come to know for the cosmic ensemble that have been at it since about 1970. 'Gazeuse' was originally released in 1976, as it features seven players. But the only two members I recognized right off were Didier Malherbe - sax&flute and Pierre Moerlen (R.I.P.) - drums & vibraphone. The other five, as far as I'm concerned are merely stand-ins. They SHOULD have come up with another name for this project, like Gong Revisted or Sons Of Gong (I know...stupid!). Unless you're an extremely open-minded Gong fan who can really open up to some decently played jazz, then you MIGHT enjoy this CD more than I did. A couple of tunes that I thought were well played are ""Expresso"", ""Night Illusion"" and ""Shadows Of"". See how you like it."
2,Not the Gong you think...,"For those who think that Gong is defined by their wonderful and psychedelic Planet Gong trilogy, ""Gazeuse"" will prove a massive disappointment. Coming after the departure of Daevid Allen, Steve Hillage, and others of the core lineup, the bulk of this album is made up of snore-o-delic jazz fusion with little spark, primarily featuring competent but somewhat uninspired guitar work by Allan Holdsworth and the ever-present remaining percussionist Pierre Moerlin. Moerlin, it should be noted, turns in the saving grace of this album, the percussion workout 'Percolations'. But the lame jazz-fusion that makes up the bulk of this offering is little consolation. Your money for Gong could be better-spent elsewhere..."
5,EDDIE MURPHY IS FUNNY!!,I GOT TWO WORDS FUNNY AND CRAZY! OR IS THAT THREE NO TWO?YOU FIGURE IT OUT LOL!
5,forget the darwinsm pseudo-physcolanalysis.....,"If you want, you can start considering the sociological implications and issues reated to the Darwinism concept (like some of the other reviews here. Theres nothing wrong with that.....), but its a lot better if you just take the film at face value - an amazing plot, excellent acting and funny jokes. This, even to date is the best movie I have ever seen. There are jokes in there for all levels, and everybody will enjoy this one. Traditionally one shown at Christmas and new year, it's bound to be on TV, but they ALWAYS edit out scenes and language - and its the original use of language, and its impact today, that makes this film. TV versions are watered down and lack the original direction and punch that the director had originally intended. (Vote for the DVD release while your here also)."
4,Classic Eddie Murphy,One of his best works eddie murphy was a comic genuis in this film aboubt two rich old men place a bet between them on whether or not heriderity or enviroment makes the man by doing so they swicth places with a yuppie(Ackroyd) and a petty street hustler(murphy) and the end results are hillalours. Original and very outlandish Murphy gives one of his best performences.
3,Pretty Funny 80's movie not Eddie or Dan's best,I enjoyed the movie it was on sale and yes I had seen it years ago not Danny's best or Eddie's best but worth $4.98 in the collection for a few good laughs give it a whirl.
5,give it 6 stars,"Edddie plays a con artist tricked into living in a rich home while a rich man is forced to live the hard life. Very funny on how each man lives change as they live ""the other side of life""."
2,"Great Movie, lousy release --","It appears that Paramount is going to go through the whole tired process of releasing this DVD with no extras only to rerelase it with extras AFTER half the movie going public has purchased the diet version. Hey Paramount, this game is becoming tiresome."
1,Another predicted Paramount rip-off,"A few years ago I wrote a review of the original release of Trading Places...warning buyers that the release was substandard with scenes omitted....and that Paramount releasing at full price was a money grab until they re-re-re release it as a ""special edition""....well...tada!!!! I was right. They have released it again...this time complete with some deleted scenes thrown in. If you've waited THIS long...I suggest you don't buy it right away...I guarantee the price will drop like a rock and will be in the bargain bin for 5.99 ot 6.99. after all this movie is over twenty years old!Still disappointing with this release is that it is that it is NOT anamorphic. This game playing by Paramount really IS tiresome."
1,Utter Garbage,This movie was the bomb before the distributors decided to make only the version laced with the f word available. What a drag! I guess I can get a few bucks for it at the half priced book store. Bummer...
3,this is 1 of eddie's first really funny movies,eddie murphy was da star in this as was other saturday night live star dan akrol was this movie apart da two of them living different lives eddie was a homeless person while dan akrol was a upper class business man two old men who are business brothers who have a network estimated in the film of 394 million dollars ruin dan arkol life while turn needy eddie turn a successful black bill gates but it was all over a bet of 1 dollar but da goes around comes back around 4 these 2 as they both lost all of their money and went broke 2 live on da streets while all da millions and maybe a billion went 2 eddie and dan and toward da end of da movie eddie and dan was in pardise with 2 pretty girls and da was da ending to a very good comedy movie Joe Brown
2,Disgusted,I saw this on TV and it was pretty good. So I bought the DVD and found out that the TV version was different from the DVD. The DVD has unnessarry nudity. Which I did not appreciate. Why do movie directors feel the need to add such garbage to films. There are so many films that are really good and would be OK for family viewing but they put in just a little bit of sex or nudity that ruin it. If they would only realise that the movie is just as good without them and more people can and would watch them if they left them out. By adding them they are excluding not only children but adults who have children in the house and adults who are modest in their beliefs.
5,One Great Movie,"Both Eddie Murphy & Dan Aykroyd give excellent performances! This from the period where Eddie Murphy made funny movies. It is a Prince & Pauper tale updated and with Eddie Murphy given the job, house and buttler of Dan Aykroyd. Try it, you'll like it."
5,No Brainer,"It goes without saying that this is one of the funniest movies ever made. ""The Prince and The Pauper"" that everyone can understand."
4,A Comedy Classic,Anyone familliar with Eddie Murphy knows this was one of his funniest roles ever and a must for one's personal film library.
5,C'mon folks - - release this on DVD!!,"Classic comedy, great movie - - and one of those rare ones worth buying..."
4,Funny 80s movie,"This is a pretty good movie. Not the best, but if you need something to watch on a slow night; this may be the movie for you."
2,Good movie but horrible DVD!,Please do not get the DVD because some of the scenes were cut. They need to make a new edition. The DVD is really bad!
5,All around the world,"I only have one thing to say about this movie. Young Jamie Lee Curtis and Topless Scene!!!! Order your copy Today! Oh yeah, Dan Aykroyde and Eddie Murphey(Probably their best movie ever) are in it too."
4,"funny film, classic actors","With so many disappointing flicks today, sometimes it's best to just watch a old classic if you want to enjoy yourself. Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy play the 'prince' and 'pauper' respectively, only their switch is actually orchestrated by a pair of wealthy old bankers who make a bet.Of course, since the victims of this switch are not aware of this plot, they are completely unprepared to deal with their sudden new life situations and the (hidden) expectations of the two old men who set out to test them. Jamie Lee Curtis is also delightful. Eventually the two men find one another and work together to get to the bottom of this joke that has been played on them - with some humorous consequences. Definitely a fun old classic."
5,Very funny business movie,"This is a good movie for b-school grads, as it combines what you may have seen at school or since with lots of good humor, but I think most others can enjoy this movie as well. Everyone loves money, right?"
4,Trading films between TV and Disc???,"I really love this film: I can add very little to what's already been said....except these. I've always wondered why when I watch the television version, there's an entire scene involving Clarence Beeks' aquisition of the crop reports that *does not* appear on the laser disc version. I've never owned the VHS version, so I don't know if it's also missing this scene. Personally, after seeing this scene on TV, I felt very annoyed that my laser disc lacked this footage. It explained a few things that seemed a bit choppy for their lacking from the disc version. I wonder now if Paramount will add this ""missing scene"" to the DVD as an extra feature. Anyone who loves this movie ought to compare the movie with and without this scene. Nudity is a bit gratuitous at times. Other than that quibble, it's a fine movie. The bookie/stock broker comparison is right on the money! Cheers! :)"
4,Timeless Hilarity,"This movie is timeless and hilarious. It is the original Eddie Murphy before he became more of a caricature of himself. The movie is set in Philadelphia where two evil rich brothers propose a bet, that a local grifter (Murphy) become more successful than Winthrop their golden boy if Murphy is given the world and Winthrop is thrown out in the cold. You follow both of there journeys and Murphy has the last laugh."
4,Good Movie.,"This is a good movie starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd. The movie is about two pwerfull brokers switching the lives of a poor person played by Eddie Murphy and a rich person played by Dan Akroyd. However, seeing this movie so many times that I know every joke and how it ends. The DVD doesn't look impressive. It looks like their is no special features."
5,All time favorite,"This is a classic! We watch it several times a year, naturally for Thanksgiving & Christmas. So many of the lines are classic and it's such fun to see the short apparences by many favorites such as Jim Belushi & Franken & Davis. Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding, and Aykroyd & Murphy are at their best. We also loved the subtle connection to this movie seen in Murphy's ""Coming to America"". We've often thought they should make a sequel, but then there is no point, this movie is untouchable. We really look forward to the release of this movie on DVD. We just purchased our 1st DVD player, and wanted this to be our first DVD movie. Two thumbs up."
3,BareBones DVD with MISSING SCENE!,"As others have mentioned this DVD is a ""bare bones"" one with no extra features. For those used to seeing it on TV, though, seeing the original R rated version will let you in on how much was edited for TV.The shocking part is that this DVD is MISSING a scene always shown on television. When Winthorp (Akroyd) walks into the Duke & Duke offices, everyone tells him good morning, greeting him by name, and he barely manages a response. That's in there. Then later, when Valentine (Murphy) walks into the Duke & Duke offices, everyone ALSO greets him by name, and he enthusiastically greets them in return, (before getting into the elevator). In the DVD, THIS SCENE IS MISSING!So, this isn't just a bare bones DVD, in one instance you actually end up getting LESS than you normally see on TV! I'm baffled by this...But, obviously, this is a classic comedy, worth owning. Too bad they don't offer a beefier DVD."
4,Looks Good On Blu-Ray,"I was pleasantly surprissed how good this looked on Blu-Ray. Sometimes the ""older"" movies don't measure up, but this looks sharp and is impressive.The story is still very entertaining, even if it has the stereotypical characters Hollywood likes to present, such as (1) the hooker who is beautiful and has a kind loving heart; (2) the black guy who, despite no training, all of a sudden is smarter than all the white guys in the financial world; (3) all rich people are snooty while the lower class are nice and good-hearted and, (4) several cheap shots at Christianity.Despite all the baloney above, this was an extremely entertaining and funny movie, start to finish. All the actors in here are fun to watch and there are a number of laugh-out-loud scenes. Of course, with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, that's not surprising. Murphy gets the bulk of the laughs. It's really his movie. For the guys, however, Jamie Lee Curtis is one to remember here."
3,Waited in vein for this DVD. Not one extra! Disappointed!,FANTASTIC movie. Since DVD was born this was one of those movies I waited and craved for. Then when the 2 disc spectacular dvds starting appearing I had my fingers crossed that this would be one. BUT of course not its Paramount. There are extras for this DVD. Memories of a Making of on TV. It wouldn't hurt to get a trailer on now would it! We know John Landis aint doing much nowadays so he could've done a commentary.I'll bite my lip and buy this bog-standard vesion and then hope in a few more years a proper special edition comes out it's only what the film deserves!
2,Excellent movie -- Amazon streaming is not reliable.,"I love the movie -- but even when free with Amazon Prime, the streaming experience was poor -- frequent pauses and interruptions. Streaming from Netflix and Xfinity to the same Samsung smart TV is far superior."
5,Murphy and Ackroyd at their best!,"Classic movie must own, looks amazing, being remastered n all! This was obviously made when Eddie Murphy was still funny, Jamie Lee curtis looks amazing (as usuall), and Dan Ackroyd is great!!!"
5,Classic film,"I don't care how many times I see this, I stil enjoy it. It is even more awesome now that my children can watch as well and enjoy the same humor as I did."
5,everything as expected,"nice dvd, as described, packaged well and shipped quickly. no disappointments. i would buy from again."
3,Not his best work,"I'm a fan of Andy Kessler. I've read Grumby and Eat People, and I loved both of them. This book seemed a bit disjointed. I feel there were some gaps with the story he was presenting. I plan on reading his other books, but I doubt if I would recommend How We Got Here."
3,"Fun, light reading for a sunday long bus ride....",Nothing more than entretaining fare for a long tedious bus ride. Would not dissapoint the casual reader. No more no less.
5,How we got here,"This is book is priceless. That is the only term I have for this book, nothing else. It is the book that any college student would want to own in his first year. With Kessler's amazing narration, one can understand the story of the modern civilization through the industrial revolution."
3,Ecotourism by David fennell,"This book is pretty alright, but there's so many references that it's hard to read just the text.It's one of those books that unfortunately you feel like you have to skip and try to search through words to learn something"
1,Limited Audience,"Unlike the others who have reviewed this book, I cannot agree that you will find this book useful if you are not a member of the LDS church. The primary reason is the LDS ""understanding"" of Christ. Any Protestant or Catholic will have an extremely difficult time dealing with the discussion of Christ's supposed pre-mortal existence and His journeys through the spiritual realm. If you are a biblical scholar, this book will be of little use to you since the author, consistent with his faith, had a view of Christ that definitely falls outside the accepted norm."
4,"Simple, Straightforward and Profound",This heart warming book has profound spiritual messages while its delivery is simple and straightforward. I found myself easily sharing the author's woe's of everyday living and sharing the gradual unfolding of peace in response to our human troubles as we realize We Do Not Walk Alone. Do yourself the favor of reading this lovely book and watch it deeply touch your life.
3,Good Overview,"For those who know little or nothing about the historical realities of the Crusades, this brief book lays out the territory in an economical and authoritative way. The author's iconoclastic approach is refreshing and he veers neither to the left nor the right in his efforts to set the record straight. The opening chapters are the most helpful in giving a fairly strict chronologic narrative while the latter chapters expand on certain themes previously touched on. Unfortunately much of the writing is rather dry and occasionally bogs down into lists of names and dates. The author peppers his text with ironic comments that could have enlivened it if used more liberally. The last chapter, that brings the political uses of the legacy of the Crusades up to the present, is actually the best in the book. As mentioned in my title, a good overview."
3,Cliff Notes to the Crusades?,"This was my first book on the crusades and I chose it based on a favorable New York Times review. I give it a lukewarm recommendation because it is so brief that it will not help the novice understand the visceral reaction Muslims have against even a mention of the crusades. You will also not learn enough about key characters, including Saladin.This well-written book is shorter even than the book description suggests. With numerous images and generous spacing this book is really a dash through the key events and theories. While it gives a good overview of the crusades I think that someone new to this extraordinary period in history needs more."
3,Popularity isn't everything...,"An unlikely, but ultimately rewarding friendship develops between popular, smarmy Margaux and uber-geek Danny, who each have some dark secrets. Margaux is beautiful, stylish--the boys want to have her and the girls want to be her. She is even smart, but she hides it from everyone. Danny, on the other end of the social spectrum, intrigues Margaux. He's smart, polite, and doesn't treat her like a trophy.Not much actually happens as far as plot, but the character development is excellent."
3,"Not Koertge's best, but still worth reading","Margaux is pretty, popular and deeply unhappy. The reader doesn't know why until she starts hanging out with not handsome, not rich and not popular Andy, who is happy. Andy works at the local animal shelter, and for fun, first alone and then with Margaux, looks to see what kind of homes the adopted animals have. Andy and Margaux are both academically adept and with each other can be honest, real friends.It's not as good as the author's _Shakespeare Bats Cleanup,_ and its similarities to _Stoner and Spaz_ are there, but I liked it more than _Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright._"
2,Resonably okay.....,"Margaux with an x is about a young lady who seems to have it all. Beauty,Popularity and can do about anything without getting into trouble at home. Yet she is not happy she holds a dark secret that happened to her when she was young.She is tired of every boy drooling over her and wanting to date her and most having no content to them. She has a gambler as a father and a mother who just watches television all day. Her life takes a different turn when she meets Danny. He is the total opposite of all the guys she has dated. He is a year behind her in high school he is thin and is not shapely, yet they both start a bond with each other. The book was interesting but after awhile I got tired and could not keep up with the constant bantering and sarcasm of the main characters."
5,Good book,This is a good book to aid in the study of the gospels. well worth the money spent for this book.
2,"Functional, but deeply flawed","Despite the description in the owner's manual and a long session with tech support, it cannot be configured for DHCP through the web interface. Difficult to impossible to re-configure without resetting with a paper clip AND use of the Windows utility. Don't be misled by the ""no drivers"" claim. If you don't have access to a Windows PC with an Ethernet card, you'll be disappointed. The Linksys WGA11B is smaller, cheaper, and easier to configure."
5,Great kitchen and bath cleaner.,"This product cleans better than other similar cleaning products on the market I've used, and the awesome fresh smell (lemon verbena) remains for a period of time after you're done cleaning. No scrubbing is required - just rinse thoroughly. I was able to easily clean the built-up grease on my kitchen cabinets with no problem. I wish I had known about this product a long time ago."
3,Didn't work well for me...,"I love Mrs. Meyer's products. The scrub, unfortunately, didn't quite work for me. Every time I tried it it didn't lather well and the powder had formed hard little balls that wouldn't break down for me. Also, my sink simply didn't look as good as when I clean it with Barkeeper's Friend. The scent and eco-friendliness of the product deserve 3 stars though."
2,not so green,"I always thought these products looked the part of clean and natural, until they showed up in my house.They are very fragrance heavy, and being a person slightly sensitive to fragrance I started to notice it would make me a bit flushed and headachy. The countertop cleaner really bothered me most of all, because it would be on my food eating and prepping surfaces.The more I was around it the more it bothered me. I would even say it was overwhelming on my table while I ate and the fragrance got into the food when I used it on my butcher block.My wife also got the hand soap and having just used it I found that it too caused me some flushed feeling. So I decided I should share my experience. I have never written a product review before, but I've decided I find the claim of natural and ""green"" to be a bit misleading. These products truly bother me where most other average products do not, be they green or conventional."
1,Smell is overpowering,Smell is way too strong. I have to cover my face with my shirt when I use it or run out of the room. It's not a natural smell. I don't like this product at all.
5,Cleans as Well as it Smells,"Not only does this cleaner work well, it smells terrific. I also use the same brand of liquid cleaner which also cleans very well.When I use the two for cleaning the complete house smells so fresh and clean."
5,My son is thrilled,"My 9 year old son is very happy with this product, which calls for logical thinking. The number score counters are hard to push along, but otherwise it's very good quality."
1,Product failure,I wanted to like this product based on cost vs Ipod. I did but experienced occasional lockups which were corrected by reseting the unit. After 14 months product failed - dead. Simply unacceptable for a mass produced consumer product. Don't waste your money as I believe I have. I will be contacting Creative to try and get a partial credit/refund.
1,Three week lifespan,"I had some concerns proir to purchasing this after reading reviews on the Amazon, NewEgg and other websites. It appears you've got a 50-50 chance of getting a good one. I took a chance and got the lemon. I lost all confidence when I finally got though to the RCA techies, and their response was ""yeah, these have issues, not really sure why"".Having to carry around a toothpick to reboot this everytime it freezes is not my idea of a quality product. Not that I use this often, maybe an hour a day, if that but when the backlight gave out, it was time to send back. Kudos to Amazon's return policy and I'll take the refund to purchase something else."
2,Doesn't work well with Audible,I bought this as an IPOD alternative for Audible books . It takes a long time to start and stop and does not return to where you left off in a book accurately. Maddening. I'd avoid this if you listen to audiobooks.
5,Buy this today!,"The Creative Zen V is just that, Zen. First off, it's the most adored electronic device I own; adored by all who see it. The picture on-line does nothing for how cute it really is, and how compact it is as well. It really can hold 500 songs and the quality is awesome. The interface is SO much better than any other mp3 player I own and it is simply zen to use. All in all, it's very worth the small amount of money it costs! Buy one today, you won't regret it!"
1,No FM,"No Fm is built in. Furthermore, in order to change the battery you have to send the product to service, which binds you to the company with additional battery change costs. I also found the menus complicated. You can check CNET for a detailed review. If you stil want to purchase, purchase the Zen V plus which includes radio."
4,none,"dont waste your money on an ipod. the zen is really easy to use and i use limewire to download music so i didnt spend any extra money on buying music. The battery lasts a long time too which is nice, once you charge it completely the first time you only have to charge it about once every week and a half, depending on how often you use it. Its also really small and light it almost disappears in your hand, but the screen looks awesome for such a small device. Also, fyi creative actually sued apple in 2006 for infringement of the zen patent, the case was settled for $612 million"
2,creative zen v,Had good luck in the past with Creative Labs. Love the software. But had last Zen V plus for 6 months and died on me. Had this one one month and screen got corrupted and eventually couldn't see at all. Very disappointed.
2,Two of these died on me,"I don't recommend. I've had two, using them with Napster. Both froze on me and the reset pin didn't revive them. They were fine for awhile and then... electronic graveyard."
3,Creative ZEn MP3,"i love the size of these and the small gb is perfect for my needs. They were very difficult to sync, it took us a while to figure it out. But now that everything is on the ZEN it is working fine."
5,"A dramatic, moving collection; each poem has a gripping personal story to tell","Becoming the Villainess is the debut collection of free-verse poetry by journalist Jeannine Hall Gailey. Addressing the archtypes of myth, from modern pop culture to Ovid to Grimm's fairy tales, Gailey weaves words expressing the hearts of shunned, reviled, justly and unjustly treated villainesses and female victims of fable. A dramatic, moving collection; each poem has a gripping personal story to tell. ""Daphne, Older"": Peel back my skin: / reveal hard fibers, bite marks, // scars from wind and rain. / Life is pain - I won't tell you // any different. Just that sometimes, / avoiding what you fear // isn't the answer. See? All these years / my branches sang with birds // and my leaves drank sunlight- / I haven't missed much. // My heartwood hardens slowly / over time - first, to the music, then, to the light."
2,"All of the songs have been re-recorded, not as good as orig.","If you like the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, I suggest you buy some of their original stuff. This is all re-recorded and it is not nearly as good."
4,Hey! A+M!,"Like the other reviewer I am puzzled as to why A+M has not put "" It'll Shines When It Shines "" onto CD. I recently bought a copy of 'Shines' on an LP from GEMM, not a bad copy but not great either. Nevertheless, it was 13 bucks well spent. I listened to the 8-track of 'Shines' until I wore it out. It was 1975, I was in college and having a great time. I would get home from classes, slap the 'Shines' 8 track home and get royally roasted. Two 'hidden' gems from 'Shines' are "" Look Away "" and "" Lowlands "". The latter song is one of the most saddest songs I have ever heard. One of the most beautiful too. I highly recommend to every Ozark Mountain DD fan to get the "" It'll Shine When It Shines "" album, someway somehow."
2,Not the recordings from the 1970s.,"If you are considering ordering this CD thinking it is a greatest hits package of the songs you remember from the 1970s, you'd only be partially correct. It seems that the band RERECORDED the old classics. This is particularly evident when you hear the title track, ""Jackie Blue"". To the band's credit, however, this fact is listed on back of the CD. But it would not be evident, of course, for Internet orders...be forewarned."
3,Why did they record this instead of releasing the originals?,"Having this album is better than having no Ozark Mountain Daredevils. But I found the quality of the recordings lack an edge that the originals had. For instance, in ""Walking Down The Road"", the orginal had an acoustic guitar solo that was one of my favorites. They replaced that with an unimaginative electric solo on this album.That being said, I am listening to it again right now because the Daredevils had an original sound that I still love, and this album captures it close enough to enjoy.I am confused about what happened to this band. Why did they record this album? Why haven't they released ""It'll Shine When It Shines"" and ""Car Over the Lake"" on CD? I would much rather have had those albums than this."
4,of course these songs are great...but...,"i'll have to agree with most of the other reviews. where the heck is a c.d. of ""it'll shine when it shines""????? most prefered "" don't look down"" which is lost forever. you can't buy any more ozark ""greatest hits"" without pure repeat of the last one you bought. hopefully this could change?! i love these guys, i grew up on this sound, and i miss them."
2,jackie blue and the ozarks,"i am a die hard fan of OMD,since about 1980,i have had the chance to see them live twice since and own most of thier stuff. this album is'nt as good as some of thier original albums on A+M records.the sound quality is less and the songs sound rerecorded, but all in all it's not a bad collection. as far as everybody else complaining about not getting it'll shine when it shines, try ozarkdaredevils.com you can get all thier original albums except the little red record."
4,Great Review & Short Version of Major Principles,"This book is a great review for all CWG readers/followers/believers. It simplifies some of the major principles/theories and may help you understand what you may not have before. Also, other people's questions are often your own!"
1,Morality is relative ?,"I enjoyed most of Walsch's first book, but I don't think he needed to write the same book over and over after that, with slight changes about what, 6 or 7 times? But this book shows a rather disturbing side of Walsch. When asked about the holocaust, he said it was extremely hard for him to deal with that subject, being sensitive to the victim's surviving relatives. And yet when a woman asks about his opinion of rape, he has no problem callously trivializing THIS issue at all! Well, according to Neale, it used to be legal to rape your wife a long time ago, so since society's idea of morality changes all the time, it's all relative, who's to say it's right or wrong? WOW!I think the one thing that one can do that goes against the harmony of Love and God is to abuse another human being, especially when it violates their free will. All the great philosophers of spirituality agree on this, but I guess Neale's god doesn't believe in the Golden Rule."
2,shabby from the start,"I washed these towels in cold water when I got them (plum colored), one had pulled threads, all had loose threads at the seams and the plum color ran into the white on the striped towel. My search for replacement towels continues."
5,Nice towels,These are nice thick towels. I washed them before use and did not have the problems noted in another review.
3,the buccaneers,"I GUESS I should have checked the cd's before hastily begin listening. the inside of the case had the binder rings opened, that should have been a clue. I put the sleeves in trustung they were all there, and proceeded to listen. i made numerous trips from no. jersey to so. jersey in the aftermath of hurricane sandy and the audio book was helping me by stealing my thoughts from our loss and the horrific tragedies of others much worse than ours. It was on one of these days on my way back to belleville after finally emptying the house distroyed that I realized cds 7 and 8 were missing from packet... very dissatisfied...will only buy from audio book sites in future."
2,A travesty,"How could this Mainwaring person have the nerve to ruin an Edith Wharton novel? Her chapters were contrived and ridiculous, a romance novel tacked onto an intelligent exploration of Americans in England. The characters completely changed ""character"" when she took over. Phew! I barely made it through the last 50 pages they were so dreadful. IF YOU'RE THINKING OF TRYING EDITH WHARTON DEFINITELY SKIP THIS ONE."
3,Compared to Middlemarch,"Had just finished reading George Eliot's ""Middlemarch"" when I discovered that Wharton's ""The Buccaneers"" was on the reading list for my book club. I am surprised that none of the reviews thus far compared Wharton's book with Eliot's book as I found both to reflect the same basic theme: expectations of society vs the oppressiveness and worth of women generally. In addition, Eliot also died before she finished her book. Would have appreciated Wharton's book more if I had read Eliot after Wharton. The literary quality of Middlemarch is truly amazing; thus the Buccaneers was somewhat of a ""let-down"". Would be interested in knowing if anyone out there shares my view."
3,Died with Wharton,"The first two-thirds of THE BUCCANEERS is brilliant, Wharton's at the top of her form -- hilarious, penetrating, exciting, effortless. Before reading, I didn't know and didn't want to inform myself precisely where the original material ended; I wanted to perpetuate the hope that there could be another great Wharton novel I hadn't read. But the book dies after chapter 29. It's like falling off a cliff. You have to be pretty insensible not to feel it yourself, and it's tremendously disappointing. I couldn't read more than a few pages of the added material, and then quit out of loyalty. Still, the Wharton first draft is a kick to read -- if for no other reason, for instance, than to see what a perfect first chapter looks like."
4,The Buccaneers,"This book was just something i grabbed of the shelf as i ran out of the library before going on holiday, i never thought for one moment what this book was but then as i began to read it i discovered what a fabulous and entertaining book it was. It took me a while to get in to it but as the story moved to England i enjoyed it more and could not put it down. I found it interesting to compare the attitudes of people in America and England and now i have just started to read another Wharton novel."
4,The Buccaneers,"The book was in much better shape than I expected it to be, based on the description. I was pleased with the condition of the book and the speed in which it arrived."
4,Pretty darn good,"If you haven't read any Edith Wharton, read Age of Innocence first, then Ethan Fromme, then House of Mirth. By then you will love her, and then it will be time for Buccaneers. This is not her very best book. It contains some of the same themes that she has covered before. There is one key difference, that makes Buccaneers unique from her earlier works and that is...something I won't give away!"
1,Please clarify,"We have no record of this item ever being shipped or received. We are, however, interested in this item, and after the issue has been clarified, we shall place an order for it. By the way, the system requires a rating; I am using one star, just to be able to send this message, which is unfair to the shipper. This should be fixed. Thank you."
2,Good sound..Bad fit,"While the clarity and ease of use is quite good, I cannot get the darn thing to stay on my ear! The lower portion of the ""hook"" is a very flexible rubber (would have been better with something firmer) and therefore basically hangs loosely on the ear instead of being secure. I've had it less than two weeks and am already out shopping for a replacement!"
3,Bluetooth Headset,Ear piece is not adjustable and volume is too low at its highest setting making it difficult to use.
1,H500 - Not good,"I have had this bluetooth a little over a year. I am very dissatisfied with it and wish I'd returned it. It does not fit tightly on the ear. With the volume turned up to the max you can't hear well at all, especially while in the car."
2,Needs a better design with the ear hook,"It's hard to put it on tightly on the ear and would often fall off on its own without any particular movement from me. When that's annoying enough, the ear hook broke in only the third months! And it's unrepairable. As a reference, with the last Logitech bluetooth I owned, the earhook cracked after two years... I was very disappointed at the earhook of this model, and that is such a critical part for a bluetooth headset!"
4,Good price - good headset,"Talking on the phone all day giving you cell ear? Give this headset a try, at the price it's a good deal. I paid almost full price for mine, and used it constantly until it broke. The replacement one I got cheap so I wasn't too unhappy. It's small, so watch where you put it. Mine ended up under foot. One crunch and it was a goner. My fault not Motorolas."
1,Not worth the cheap price,"Purchased the original one and it did not work right out of the box. Would not even charge up. Exchanged for another one and this one the charger worked but the phone had terrible sound quality for the person on the other end calling the bluetooth. It would crackle and pop. The person wearing the Bluetooth it sounded okay. Sent this one back also for a refund, and then went out and spent more then I wanted to, but purchased a $79.00 Jabra BT530 which has great sound quality and you can even listen to music through it if your phone has capiblity for playing music."
3,It works,"The Motorola H500 is a pretty good product. The battery lasts long if you take care of it; meaning don't leave it on the charger after the light turns off. I can use it as a headset when chatting on my Mac, so that's a plus. The only issues that I have is that every now and then people can't hear me when it's in use, but that could be because of a low battery issue. Over all it's a really good phone accessory."
1,very bad audio quality..,"It has very very bad audio quality. I tried it with three different cell phones and every time it added very loud hissing noise during phone conversation making it difficult to communicate. And I was testing it from a quiet room.Despite lots of ""not good"" reviews I bought it thinking I'll get a good one. I'm not interested in any features. But if the product is not delivering the very basic functionality then what else to look for? I end up returning it."
4,Nice headset,"This headset works just fine, but I do have a couple of things I would consider when buying my next headset: (1) even though I bought a case for it, it still sometimes gets pressed on inside of my purse, and I get annoyed when I try to answer my phone if I've left the Bluetooth feature on it on. (2) I have small ears, and the ear-piece is not adjustable. It doesn't quite fit right, so if I move around too much or turn my head too fast it sometimes falls off. I mostly use it in the car, though, and have started leaving it in the car when I'm not using it, so it works just fine for what I need it for."
3,Not the best...,"I am not too happy with this bluetooth headset. Most of my friends complaint about echo, voice not clear etc. Most times I have to scream esp. when I am driving.The only good thing about it is the battery life, it lasts for days..."
3,Good choice for the price,"I only use my blue tooth device when driving, it's very important since my vehicle is manual transmission so having my hands free is important. The only thing I don't like about this blue tooth, is that sometimes when I turn it on, it won't link with my cell phone (chances are 1/10), so turning it off and back on would work but, it doesn't convince me. It doesn't look ""cute"" but it does the job."
2,NOT SO GREAT,"After 6 months I had to buy another earpiece. This Motorola was way too big for my ear and kept falling off. I also really never got the hang of the buttons. I felt that there was too little distinction between what you wanted it to do; so if you hit the button a second too long it did something totally different than what you wanted, etc. I went with a funny looking Jabra that and I feel I have much better control over the buttons and commands and it fits nicely around the ear and feel very comfortable."
2,Just okay,I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear. It appears to wobble around the ear and leaves me with the feeling that it is going to fall off at any time. There are many better headsets out there that fit more comfortably and do not leave you wondering what is going to happen.
3,Not what I expected,"Before I purchased this product, I read the reviews. The reviews were good so I bought it. Well I am not really satisfied."
1,Truly a piece of junk,"This product works well if you have a table with one short leg and you can just wedge it under and flatten it. As a headset, it's worthless. Get the Plantronics Voyager - it's the only bluetooth headset that doesn't suck."
1,Bad Experience,"I bought the H500 headset and it was TERRIBLE! It had so much static you could not carry on a conversation! When I took it back to the cell phone store I was informed by the salesperson that they had sent back all of their H500's because of the static and unsatisfied customers. I purchased an H700 and LOVE IT! There is no camparison! Don't waste your money on the H500, mine went in the trash!"
3,There must be better choices,"Does everything it's supposed to do, but the one major problem I have with it, is the mike. It picks up everything in front of you and my callers comment on it all the time, so this device with some sort of noise-cancelling mike would be ideal.I tried several with the flip-out boom mike, and while they were an improvement, they wouldn't stay on my ear as nicely as the H500.I'd keep looking."
2,Was fuzzy for other person,The buttons and size of the headset were decent and the quality of the call for me was ok but the person on the other end said it was pretty fuzzy when I talked to them. Speakerphone on my phone worked better than this headset. It was bad enough that I had to return this headset and buy a different brand headset for about the same price but is very clear on both ends of the call.
3,Motorola H500,"This bluetooth is not bad for the person using it, only for those on the other end of the line. Everytime I call someone they tell me they have this interference noise, but to me it is crytsal clear. Not real sure why, I have even tried having the person call me back or tried calling them back, but the noise continues. Not real sure if I just received a defective item or not...."
3,Good Headset,"this headset is about par as far as bluetooth headsets go. fairly comfortable earpiece but the over the ear wire is a little stiff and uncomfortable. sound quality is good but not great. the finish is a little better than most and it feels durable, for a lower end headset. overall, this headset is a decent one for the money."
3,some drawbacks,"This bluetooth is basically ok but the part holding on to your ear is very 'flimsey' and tends to want to fall off if u bend over so u have to keep securing it on your ear, which is quite annoying as I almost lost it a few times not realizing it was no longer on my ear...so it's a huge drawback for me. It seems to work ok otherwise tho sometimes I do have a sound problem that is not present when I just listen straight from the phone without it...it's sometimes quite garbled. So this product for me though cute, is average in fuction."
2,Too much background noise and electronic echos,"This is my second try at finding a decent Bluetooth headset. This H500 is better than the Jabra BT150 that it replaced, but not good enough. Outgoing voice sound is reported back as electronically odd sounding with buzzing clicking background noise. Also listeners report electronic insect sounding echos. Hear odd incoming echos and buzzing sounds as well. Both of the above headsets have been paired to a LG VX8300 phone.Don't like the fit or feel of this headset. The Jabra fit significantly better. The controls are also hard to find and use.Now going to try a Plantronics Voyager 510 based on Amazon ratings. (It worked great and is still performing well a year and a half later)"
2,Easy to set up,It was real easy to sync with my phone Motorola V551 had complaints of too much background noise on the other end and it wouldn't stay on my ear very well so it made it hard to hear the other person on the line. The talk time is not accurate talked for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours and 7 to 8 standby on 1 charge charged in 2 hours though. priced good sells for $50 to $60 at phone store.
1,Very bad do not buy,Very bad do not buy cannot hear from Bluetooth just looks good bad design need improvement contact the Motorola they you have to sent to us we can give new one
3,it was 'ok',"I brought this to use with my Droid Razr. I could never get the volume to work. I could barely hear the person I was talking to and I always felt like I had to yet. The volume got worse after a couple months until I just stopped using it. Too bad, because it was very small and cute."
1,High Pitch buzz/ring on other line,Horrible sound and a ringing noise that would make the people i called hang up. I would not recommend this product.
1,Plain Awful,"I could hear fine on my end, but listeners didn't want to talk with me because from there end it was distorted and screechy. Just plain awful and a total waste of money. I would like my money back."
1,Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset,"I just bought this from a Verizon store in NJ and was told it was the most popular model. Like reviewers, I find the echo unacceptable. In addition, the other caller sounds tinny and electronic like they have inhaled helium. Very disappointed and I would avoid this product."
3,Decent Bluetooth,"Not as comfortable as the HS820, but it is a pretty good device. I like that it uses the mini USB charger like Motorola RAZR."
5,one more happy customer,"Although I did not purchase this product for myself. I have recieved nothing but happy reviews about the Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset, and the service that I got from Amazon. Is as it always is. WONDERFUL! And I will continue to order again and again from Amazon, because I know that the merchandise I order from them will always be the top of the line, and that they will give me the best price for the product. Thank you Amazon."
5,Received as ordered!,"Works great, simple to link up, doesnt fall off easily. Received quickly and with all the good stuff! Would recommend A+++"
5,Great Headset,"i just love this headset. Works great on the road. The price was the best thoough; the headset, car charger and travel charger was only 28.00 and the chargers charge my Motorola Razr also. How great can that be.Jennifer, 24, GA"
4,Very good product....,I am very happy with the size and style of the headset. The only thing i am not totally happy with is all the background noise that can be heard by whomever you are talking to. But i would still recommend it.
2,Blue Tooth?? Why not better,"It was slow getting here and the sound quality was not up to snuff, I have not seen a blue tooth headset that sound very good yet no matter the price, wired is the only way to go"
2,Not compatible,"Despite claims otherwise, this Motorola headset does not work with all cell phones. My Sony-Ericsson cell phone was not compatible with this headset, nor with a Motorola H350.I was forced to buy a Sony-Ericsson headset if I wanted one that worked with my Sony-Ericsson phone."
2,Not so Great,I wnated this to use for my car. Reception was fine with Treo 650 however I couldn't hear the caller. Perhaps the headset did not fit my ear well or this unit was malfunctioning but it was worthless. I drive a car that is quiet so I wasn't asking that much of the unit. It was marginal in a quiet room. I replaced it with a Pantronics Discovery 640. Much more expensive but works well (see my other review)
2,stand down,"The fit and the sound are good, but, this headset does not remain in standby mode after five minutes of inactivity. The user guide says the indicator light goes out to conserve power but that the headset remains in standby mode. But I've found that after the light goes out, I've got to turn on the headset again to make a or receive a call, holding the multifunction button. That's inconvenient if I'm driving and not wearing the heaset when receiving a call. In standby mode, the unit should automatically connect when I make a call or ring and just require a tap on button to receive a call. Amazon was quick to replace the headset at no shipping or return cost to me, but the replacement has the same problem."
1,Really dissapointed,"I bought this thinking I could use it in the car while driving. First of all, since the microphone is attached to your ear, other people hear all sorts of noise besides your voice; Second, I can't seem to pick up incoming calls and seem to have to answer it with my cell phone which is what I wanted to avoid; Third, can't tell when it's running out of juice since there is no indicator; and lastly, it disconnects from the cell when it feels like it. I would wait for technology to get better before buying this kind of thing."
4,Good product overall,"Pros - good price, works great with my RAZR phone, seems to have relatively long battery life. Cons - sound quality, volume, the headset can be hard to hear in environments with background noise. Overall - a good product, but it might not be the right choice if you always have to make and receive calls in areas with a lot of background noise."
2,Great when it works..,The single most frequent problem I have with this headset is that it constantly loses connection with my RAZR phone. I've used two different RAZRs with it and both of them have the same problem. I've paired it and re-paired it multiple times but always with the same problem. Getting the H500 replaced at the dealer didn't help either.It's rather frustrating when you're talking to someone and then suddenly you can here them but they can't hear you.
2,Too big..,"I love the reverse earpiece, however, the piece was entirely too big for my ear(s). Not recommended for small ears."
1,Not what I expected,"I am not happy with the Motorola Bluetooth. It does not fit well at all and the reception is poor. I had to stop using it because no one on the other line could hear me clearly. It's cheap for a reason, folks!"
1,its really unworthable....,To noisey its not fix on the ear properly.realy worst experience for me.. firsttime i was unsatisfaied with moto product...
2,"Eh, there is much better out there","It is useable at best. The ear hook is not adequate and falls off easily, I have not had this happen ever before. The volume of my earpiece is very low and makes it hard to hear in the car. I would suggest buying a better model"
5,I can hear clearly now...handsfree.,"The product is great. It allows me to talk without my hands having to hold the telephone. I haven't had many problems with it, though as all other headsets, you need to have your phone nearby (you can't leave the phone on a desk in one room and walk off with the headset on your ear). Great idea, and good product."
4,A Good Choice,"Replaced that crappy BodyGlove device with this one. Better reception (although a slight echo) but very easily trained. Overall a good value, a keeper."
2,worthless,"not only it dances on your ear, but also it is unpredictable of when it will and will not work. I eventually caught on and learned that it will work on the second dial. So when i call someone, i hit send, wait a second, hit end, then dial again. I could not find a work around for when it works during receiving except to turn it off and use the phone and risk loosing the caller."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I expected a better quality product this day and age. Not very pleased with it at all. I looses connection, sound sometimes dissapeares. But it did cost me less than $40."
5,MUY BUENO,"ESTE TIPO DE BLUETOOTH ES MUY PRACTICO YA QUE NO HAY NECESIDAD DE INTRODUCIRSELO EN EL OIDO ASI EVITANDO ALGUN TIPO DE DAÑO O INFECCION EN LOS MISMOS , SE ADAPTA MUY BIEN A LA OREJA , YO LO COMPRE PORQUE TENIA UN MODELO ANTERIOR QUE ERA UN POCO MAS GRANDE Y ME FUNCIONO EXELENTEMENTE."
2,Don't waste your money,"This bluetooth headset is no good. Once it is farther than 2 FEET from the phone, the reception will start to break up. Sometimes even when it's really close to the phone the reception is awful. When is comes to headset you're going to have to pay up if you want quality."
4,GOOD ITEM,"Clear crisp sound. Good size for the ear and good quality. The only thing is that it does not let you put it on your left ear. Oh, well."
1,H500 stinks,"I have tried several things to make this work. Even have changed the phone once. Nothing works. There is too much static most of the time. The device goes to sleep with a few minutes of non-use, and is difficult to wake back up. Usually to get things working again I need to restart both the phone and the headset."
3,It makes its own calls,"I like the device well enough, except that if it gets ""bumped"" it dials a random (seemingly)number (one that's stored in the phone), without my knowing it. So I'm more careful about where I put it now. I'm tired of explaining.Also sometimes it gets disconnected from the phone by itself, after its been on for a while - and in close proximity. And occasionally I have to turn everything off (reboot phone and bluetooth) to get them to connect.Once it's working, it's fine."
5,Simplicity at a decent price,"I have paired this with an unlocked RAZR, and so far they both have worked great (2 months).It fits well on both ears, not so big, and the voice quality is very good. I also found the price from amazon, really competitive"
4,No Problems,Everything arrived in a timely fashion and works well. There's a bit of a learning curve for this 59 yr. old but my 30 yr.old son has one (that he paid twice as much for!) and he can use all the bells and whistles easily!
2,Maybe I got the bad one from the batch,"The device looks sleek and is rather small which is good for wearing over long periods of time. However, its grip over the ear is rather flimsy and sudden head movements leave the device flapping. I would really have loved to keep the device but had to return mine because people had problems hearing me when I used it. From what I gathered, I sounded like I was talking through a tin can. However, I could hear callers quite clearly. I tried everything I could using the buttons available to see if this could resolve the issue to no avail. I initially thought the problem could be that I was using the H500 with my LGCU500 phone and somehow, they were not optimized to work with each other. However, I tested the headset with a friend's Motorola V551 phone and had the same results. Other people I have talked to who own an H500 haven't experienced these issues so it could very well be that I got the bad one which somehow made it past the quality checks."
4,Perfect fit to ear and sounds great,I was very uneasy about buying this headset but the reviews were great for it which convinced me to purchase it. I am very glad that I did. I use it with a Blackberry 8800 and people that I have told that I am using this headset have all said that it sounds better then when I just use the BB to speak. I can hear people on the headset even with my windows down in my truck and on the highway. Now of course if the wind is really strong I can't hear that well but that is with any phone.If I needed two or three I would choose this headset again especially for the price.
2,"OK, but there must be something better!","I've been using the Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset for a couple of frustrating years. It sometimes turns itself on or off (usually when I need the opposite - I can be in the middle of a conversation & BAM - GONE!). Also, the volume control works, but not the greatest - the way the headset hangs over my ear makes it difficult to hear if there's any noise around me; if I turn my head too quickly, the headset will fall off . I can switch ears, but not as easily as other units. Lastly, I don't know if it's a phone issue or a headset issue, but when I've tried to turn off the headset & use the phone's speaker while on a call, it won't work - can't get the headset to turn off w/o losing the call. Even then, if the headset is in the vicinity, the headset acts possessed! I'm researching for a different one."
3,Ok...but...,"This blue tooth headset is nice... when it's working. I have a Treo 700. I find that I have to re-pair the device or turn it off and on or turn the blue tooth setting on my phone off and on to get it to work sometimes. It could be the quality of the blue tooth on my phone, but either way, it's frustrating. When the headset works without my having to fool around with it, I find the sound quality to be excellent. Additionally, persons I am speaking with find that they hear me clearly which isn't the case when I've used corded headsets."
3,Motorola H500 Bluetooth headset,"The bluetooth headset gets three stars from me. It works well, is very light, and is easy to use. However, it has one fatal flaw: its voice activated command function works very, very poorly. Not a single time has my command been understood by the headset (I suppose this could be a phone problem). In any case, the voice activated command function is worthless in my opinion."
3,Bluetooth Headset,"I am a little disappointed the headset. It flops off my ear and has static when I was using my old phone (Audiovox 5600, and Motorola v551)"
4,Good Headset,"I was a little sceptical of these headsets considering the bad reviews of people who use them, but I was pleasantly surprised. It has great quality sound and very easy to set up and use. At times it picks up too much ambiant noise, but overall it is a great product."
2,Would not buy again,My device in only 2 months old stops working in the middle of calls have to reconnect all the time. I think this product was not designed using the 6 sigma process they are known for.
2,Its ok...,Nice size and weight. Kind of a pain to use and useless in a convertible. OK...to be honest I really don't like it at all.
1,I have just received a empty box,"I don't know why it's just a empty box delivered to me. When I received that, it is laid down on the floor out of my door. I have called the carrier company - USPS, but they just said they will investigate into. I don't know who steal it or it is empty ever from the manufacturer."
5,+++ good headset+++,"It is a good headset, but I have some difficulties with ""conect"" it to my ear, I have the felling that the headset will fall of everytime."
2,Ouch my Ear,Ordered this based on some of the reviews I read and must admit that it does have average to good clarity. But I must admit the ear piece is very uncomfortable to the point of being painful. Returned it because I could not take the comfort issues. Would not recommend this item.
2,Holy Headset,"Well, actually I was a little disappointed with this headset. The volume controls on the headset aren't sensitive enough for easy volume changes. And you have to push the connect/disconnect button pretty hard to activate. However, the biggest problem I have with this is that the ear holder doesn't rotate around the earbud axis. So you can only control the positioning one dimensionally. It's not as comfortable as my old one as a result."
2,Motorola H500 not as good,"This H500 was a replacement for a lost H8500. It was disappointing.1. The ON-OFF feature is hard to use with little feedback.2. The unit turns itself on when you carry it in your pocket. That in turn makes the cellphone misbehave: it dials last-number very easily; and you can't hear any calls, incomming or outgoing; even though the phone rings and you can dial out.2. Noise canellation does not work. Nearly useless as a hands-free device in a automobile environment."
4,Not too bad,"Okay, I'll admit it: I have larger than normal ears. Perhaps that's why the earpiece works pretty well for me. I can wear it for long periods without any discomfort, even though I also wear glasses.The sound quality for the user is also excellent. I can hear the person on the other line perfectly. It's really quite impressive. However, I will say that the person on the other end isn't particularly loud. Generally, I can hear the other person without any trouble while driving at around 70 mph in my Acura RSX, but it's a little faint with some people. I think this is the main deficiency of the device -- the sound could be louder.On the other hand, it's very lightweight, has an amazing battery life, has a low price, and it pairs with my Nokia 6600 without any problem. All in all, I'm glad I bought it."
1,shorty atkins,"The motorola bluetooh 500 is very lightweight and sleek but the main feature I purchased it for is the one feature I am very disappointed about. Being able to go wireless. My customers complain that while talking to me they get an echo on their side of the phone, both cell phones and land line phones. It gets so annoying to them that they ask me to cut the bluetooth off. Customer service from motorola is very personable but I still have a problem with the bluetooth. Heading back to the store where I purchased this item for their tech support or hopefully exchange."
2,Looks Good but.....,"I bought this to replace my Logitech bluetooth headset because I wanted one that looked a bit more professional. Looks good, but the complaint at the other end is ""what windtunnel are you in?"". The Logitech headset is much better at picking up voice commands and clarity of sound. Wish I hadn't wasted the money on this H500."
3,Good sound; annoying echo.,Been trying to find a bluetooth that doesn't create annoying echo for the people talking to me. People reported echo on this one. Perhaps others have had better luck. Sound quality was quite good.
3,"Ok, but for money must be something better!","I bought this to use with my Motorola Razr, it was really easy to set up and seemed to charge quickly and best of all uses the same charger as the phone. It was very compact and light and fit well on my ear and it didn't feel like it was going to fall off. The one button control is really simple however it is extremely touchy. I was continually re-dialing last number when I dropped it in my purse and unless you had it on your ear when you turned it off was difficult to tell if it is off or not as it is an audible indicator.I paid almost $70 for it and I wound up taking it back because there was a slight electronic noise in the background and even with the volume all the way up if there is ANY background noise at all it is hard for you to hear it. I usually use it when I am driving to/from work and even after turning my radio off I found it quite difficult to hear the person I am speaking with."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I purchased this earpiece to go along with my POS Motorla RAZR phone. It has a poor fit and doesn't fit comfortably around my ear. It just hangs there, which makes it hard to hear and for others to hear me. I can't bend down without it falling off. Callers have often complained of a ""buzzing"" sound that emits when it is used. The sound quality if very poor and disappointing."
3,Works Well but Call Button is Frustrating,"It have both Motorola's H350 or H500 and both work quite well, fit well on the ear and are not too heavy (like my old Jabra BT800). The problem I have had is when placing them in the Motorola belt pouch (not included but an accessory I like to use rather than keeping the headset in a pocket), both of these headsets will get their call button pressed and make unintended calls. In 2 days, I have made at least 6 unintended calls to 4 different people. I never had this problem with my Jabra BT800."
3,Sound Quality Issues,"Quick and Dirty Review!SPEAKER - Good, crisp sound!MICROPHONE - Apparently no noise cancellation, conversation partner will complain about echo, noise, and muffled sound..... especially if it is not FULLY charged!FIT - Light weight, no pressure points, and interchangeably able to wear on left or right ear."
2,Motorola H500,"I have been using it for about 2 months now and up till now it worked great with my Sony Ericsson Z520i. I have had no problems in getting it connected (paired) with my phone and it has never disconnected on its own.However, the battery life has just diminished to 30% all of a sudden. I have tried charging it at different wall outlets and have measured my use, which has not changed. Seems like something is wrong with the battery.I will NOT recommend it to anyone, although when it works it has great sound and no one can tell that I am using a headset. Although there is some disturbance in windy situation but overall this product is great except for poor battery performance."
1,don't buy this item,"I purchased the H500 for my motorola e18. The design is snappy, but the sound quality was quite poor and very noticeable to the people on the other line. I returned this headset and bought a plantronics. While it is a little more cumbersome on the ear, the sound quality is much improved."
3,"High hopes, low reality","It's important to note that I have a Treo 700w.PROS: the setup instructions are easy and clear and battery life and range are good. The fit was very good and very light. Excellent receiving sound quality. Standard mini USB charger port.CONS: most callers (victims) on the other end said I sounded anywhere from being horribly digitized and distorted to at best acceptable - sounding like I was speaking with a voicebox vibration unit for a tracheotomy patient. this was true testing with two different Treo 700w units.Other thoughts: I did extensive testing with another technician to see if I could get it past acceptable to ""good"". The best is in a very small enclosed place like next to your monitor at work or used on the ear side that is next to the window in a car so that sound can bounce back to the mic, otherwise the sound is coming from your jawbone.If you plan to use it in these environments then the price is right for you."
3,DONT BUY THIS IF YOU THINK YOU CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC,I bought this headset thinking that i could listen to music but you cant. Other than that this is a great pruduct but all you can do is talk to people with it. The only phone you can listen to music with is the motorola Q.
5,Fast delivery,"Received my bluetooth within 5 days. Packaged nicely in a strong box. Am charging it now so I can start using it. I love this model, as it is so comfortable you forget you are wearing it."
4,"Great headset, one small aggrevation",I love this headset! It's light and people say it sounds good. I only wish it didn't turn on so easily. When I'm not using it I put it in my pocket where it gets turned on frequently. I suppose the button gets depressed momentarily when I'm doing things. Otherwise it's great!
3,Not as good as I'd hoped.,I bought this because I thought I'd lost my Jabra BT500 and my wife loves her Motorola so much. Wrong! For me the Motorola looks better but the Jabra offers better hearing! Luckily I found my Jabra and gave the Motorola away.
1,Bad News,"I bought this product in September and it was much harder to use than my other Bluetooth. It also never worked properly and came on automatically, when I didn't want to use it. If a call came in, it would be silence on my cellphone beecause the bluetooth picked it up.In January the on-off button stopped working and I called the ""Cell Phone Shop"" to return it, and they said there was a 90 day warranty and I was out of luck-Won't buy from them again. Very disappointed-Linda"
3,DON'T USE WITH YOUR BLACKBERRY,"Worked great on my LG, my wife still has hers. My phone broke, got a blackberry, I can hear people talking, but they tell me it's all static. It worked great on the LG phone I broke... I would love it if they made it compatible with the Blackberry."
2,Too many complaints,Practically everytime I am on the phone talking to someone I get complaints from people saying that they hear wind in the back ground as if I'm driving with the window down. This is the second time I have purchased a motorola H500. I decided to buy it again because I thought maybe the first one I had was just defected. But not I see obviously not.
3,So-so,"Bought this unit as a replcement for another Bluetooth I had - same model. My original one was great but just wore out after a few years. The replacement is very inferior in quality. The function button sometimes doesn't work at all or I have to push it so hard, it's uncomfortable. Also, the sound quality is fair to poor. I kept it thinking it needed to be broken in but after a few months it hasn't. This latest purchase cost significantly less than my original unit and the quality is much less also."
3,Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset,"Price good but comes on too easy in case or pocket when you do not want. Callers complain that it is not clear, but I hear caller fine."
3,"It's okay, I sound like a Robot.","So I looked at the reviews and I decided to buy this product. I ignored the ones that said it had an echo because everyone else was very enthusiastic about it. When I got it, I loved it. It was so light weight and I couldn't even tell that it was on. But, when I talk to people on it, they have trouble hearing me and they say I sound like a robot. Well this robot sound is an echo. My friend has the same one and when he calls me on it, he sounds like a robot too! So I guess they are all like that, but its enough that I don't use it anymore."
3,It's OK,"This is my fiest bluetooth head set so I can't give comparison.This is good stylish, comfortable with some problem also.microphone is not good i think, voice on the other side not reached easily you need to be little louder."
3,Phone part works great but doesn't fit my ear,"The headset itself sounds great, is easy to pair and connect and comes with good instructions. However, the ear clip was made for an elephant. It has a very loose fit and cannot be adjusted. I think this one is going on eBay. I'll buy one out of a store next time so I can try it on before shelling out the cash."
1,One Star because you can't go into negatives,"This is a horrible headset. I figured for a retail price of over sixty bucks, one might expect at least a modicum of sound quality. Not so.The first call I placed using this device was to my friend, who, upon hearing me, mistook me for a Borg. The second was to my father, who, lacking any experience with Star Trek, said I sounded ""like a stupid robot"".That's bad enough, but when you combound it with the high-pitched whiny buzz that the reciever hears in the background, you don't have a headset so much as an incredibly efficient friend-alienation gadget.I for one will be sticking with my crappy old wired headset, which may be a bit more obtrusive, but doesn't irritate everyone I call."
2,Not a solid performer,"Had H500 for over a month. I often receive complaints from callers that an echo exist or to much static. Feels loose on my ear. Holds a good charge, but not a stellar unit."
5,Works great and is comfortable.,I have never found any headset that I have to put inside my ear to be comfortable. I just wish I could listen to music through this headset as well.
1,"Loud buzzing noise, more problems","I previously used a Jabra bluetooth headset, so I figured I'd try this Motorola bluetooth headset. Big mistake!While using the headset, my call recipients heard a loud buzzing noise. Since I bought two as a gift, I asked my brother-in-law to call me from the headset I bought for him, and I also heard a loud buzzing noise.This headset does not fit comfortably when you are using glasses...tends to not stay in the ear. Also, it does not have the flexibility of movement for the ear hook.I will go back to using Jabra!"
2,used,for some reason i got used headset in a new cover.although it was the lowest price in amazon for h500 headset but now i know the reason.
4,Good Stuff,"good blue tooth set, works great for me! charges fast, pairs with my phone well... but it doesn't stay on my ear very well... other than that, this works great!!!"
3,So far so good but...,"This is my first BT. I am using it with the Razr V3. Hearing quality is wonderful. However, what is up with the general genric phone ""ring"" I have certain ringers for certain people. Why won't the BT recognize my ringers? Other than that, it works great for me."
3,Great looking product.... average quality,"After a couple of weeks of using this product, i experienced static and horrible sound quality .At times I had to move into a spot so that the static would subside. Overall, i liked the look of the product but didn't like the quality"
3,not bad,"this earpiece has wonderful options and functions, but the design is a little lacking in that it can fall off the ear quite easily. wonderful functions don't mean a thing if it falls off and drops in the toilet."
1,Very disappointed,"I've had the same problems others are reporting. Style and usability seem great, but performance is quite bad. If I was in a quiet room things seemed to be ok, but if there is any background noise at all, people couldn't hear me. Any time I tried to use it in the car, people couldn't hear me or said it sounded terrible. Also, the range seemed to be very intermittent. If I was at home I could walk around without my phone and things would work great. In the car I would get low signal warnings and dropped connections all the time. Even when the phone was right next to the headset sometimes it wouldn't connect to my razr.I'm going to be returning it tomorrow."
4,Nice accessory,"I bought this a week ago at a wholesale club and paid $20 more than the current price on Amazon. I bought this as an accessory for a Motorola v557 cellphone. I've been pleased with both. The headset is lightweight and unobtrusive - even when wearing sunglasses. Definitely better than having a wire running from the earpiece to the phone. The sound quality is nice and it was easy to set it up for use (""pairing"") with my cellphone."
3,Not Bad,This is the first Bluetooth headset I bought. I expected a little secure feeling of the headset but the overall quality is great. If it had a more secure feeling I would have given a higher rating. But like stated in other reviews this headset has a big difficulty being shaken off...it will stay on you ear. It is a very nice addition to my calls knowing when someone is calling me with the in-headset tone. I still would like to find one that sticks to my ear a little better.
1,unusable,the product is unusable being returned a real pain. Everyone called complains about a noise like a horn while we are talking. the quality control on the refurb leaves something to b desired. only plus is that it can be returned. should be a zero star but thay won't let me.
1,bluetooth,"I hate it !The ear piece doesn't stay on your ear it falls off your ear and hits the floors constantly, or your in a store and now you have to worry about getting run into while you look for the thing on the floors with others shopping.. For people with small ears it's even worse. I bought this one for a mans head there are no inner ear plugs and with the item just hanging on on ear it's almost impossible to get the signal of an incoming , and if you can hear it, when the signal comes for a call, it's even worse trying to speak through it..reception and ear location and the fitting of the thing is the worst item i have ever purchased. Motorola is a decent name brand..but failed with these ..and I bought 2 of them !!!!! grrrr I wouldn't suggest these to anyone !!Cheap Cheap..you pay for what you get.ONE STAR ONLY !!!!!"
3,"Good sound quality, volume level could be higher","Overall, I have had a good experience with the H500across multiple phones: Sony Ericsson, Samsung,Motorola, UTStarcom.Downsides:low volume in noisy environments (highway driving, forexample), lacks locking feature to keep headset fromaccidentally turning on or making unintended callsfrom your pocketUpsides:sound quality, small size, comfort"
2,Taking it back,"I bought this yesterday and it's going back. For me, it only works properly about half the time. I made one call, it was crystal clear, the next call, I was told I sounded like I was in outer space. Too unreliable for me. The only pros were I like the color and it fit well. I bought the Motorola H670 and have had no problems with it."
4,H500,This blue tooth works fine except that every two weeks or so you have to re sync it to your phone. I use a Sprint Palm and for some reason it drops the link. No Biggie. GREAT sound quality.
3,Poor sound quality on the other end,"I've owned this headset for over a year now. I use it every time I'm in my car driving anywhere. I don't have any problem hearing people on the other end. However, everyone I've spoken to while using the H500 has complained about words being dropped (whole sentences even). I can't drive with a window cracked because the road noise transmits so loudly people can't hear what I'm saying. I'm actually on amazon right now looking for something better."
