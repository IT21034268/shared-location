1,Lets have a bonfire with this book.,"I, along with many, many unfortunate ap students, was forced to read this book for summer reading. I found it pointless, annoying, and a complete waste of time and money. My grandma LOVES reading long, colorful books, much like this. However she couldnt stand it and either could anyone else I know. If you like to learn about how a river makes a person think about tennis balls, then i must recommend this book to you. So please burn this book. Well, I guess a lesson we could learn form this book would to not BURN it but to ""recycle"" it."
3,smack dab in the middle,"This book was a one of a kind. Dillard's unique style kept my attention throughout the entire book. I especially liked the way that she left no loose ends and tied everything in the book together. The only reason that the book did not receive a higher rating from me was that it often gave way too much information and ventured far beyond boundaries of pointlessness. Overall, this was an intertaining book and well worth the time to read."
3,Interior Monologue - gasping for real air,"I too had started reading this years ago and gave it up after a few pages as too boring. I picked it up again and this time found the first 2/3 actually interesting. The meditation of the life around her, the interesting details about how various animals survive thru animalistic means (eg praying mantis) and the ying/yang of life (anectdotes of Eskimo survival) were well written. But around at the 2/3 point, I started to really want these religious and natural observations to really apply to her relationship with others. Throughout the book there is SO little human interaction for a person of this perception to be so devoid of the pleasure of human contact -- I found this aspect to be increasingly disappointing and stifling. It almost seemed to be a study in a year of depression."
5,This book is a vacation!,"I am reading this wonderful book as slowly as possible, savoring every beautiful descriptive sentence. It has helped me to appreciate nature on a new level -- what higher praise can a book have?"
3,Intricacy,"Annie Dillard's book reminds me of Blue Pastures by Mary Oliver. They both ramble on about anything and everything they discover, and give you more details than you'd care to know. Her work is also similar to Thoreau's WALDEN. They both examine nature closely by living in the midst of it. PILGRIM AT TINKER CREEK is not a book I would have chosen to read on my own. However, I did enjoy it. Her romantic prose presents nature in an almost mystical way. Through her descriptions you discover her love and awe of nature and all that coincides with it. My favorite chapter was The Fixed. It was scientific and more dramatic. It also had a reflective tone at times where she was questioning all that she saw and not merely accepting it as being there. I also enjoyed her circle effect. She brought up things that you might not have noticed before and made sure you payed them attention. If you are a lover of nature and romanticism, with some cynical humor thrown in the mix, this is the perfect book."
3,a review by a 7th grader,"I found this book very confusing, but interesting. She (the author) is a very descriptive writer, but it is hard to decipher her meaning through the complexity. She rarely talks about other people, but instead she talks about her own experiences. If you can get past the way it is written, it holds interesting concepts.""When I was quite young, I fondly imagined that all forighn languages were codes for English"" is the start of one of her curious topics. If this book only had one word in it it would be the word ""nature."" That is what the book is built around ant the topic it never leaves. If you are a determined reader and love the natural world, this is definitely the book for you.i read this for a school assignment, so i am probably not old enough to understand it completely"
4,A Modern Spiritual Classic,"Though not represented as a Christian book, Annie Dillard is often quoted in Christian circles. Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is a modern spiritual classic of extraordinary insight and exquisite writing. You will either fall in love with this book or find it hard to wade through the detailed, almost laborious, descriptions that seem at times to meander randomly through the pages only in the end to be twined together in purpose and meaning. Her abstract thoughts and spiritual excursions tease the reader with questions of the meaning and purpose of a violent world that riddles its occupants with pain and suffering. In the end her questions find resolution in her own soul as she walks the banks of Tinker Creek in Virginia and comes to grips with the diametrical realities of a fallen world and of a loving God."
2,Well writtien with one shortcoming the book is about nothing,"Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is a well written book. In fact it is beyond well written. The language and her use of similies and metaphors is profund. However the book does leave something to be desired. A subject. The book is about nothing. Every well written page essentially says the same thing, nothing."
2,Very well written but very long and tedious.,"I had very high hopes for this book but was disappointed. To be honest, I gave up after reading 30% of the book. The prose is wonderfully constructed and some of the descriptions of the natural wonders, both great and small, border on the poetic. I understand that this is a book about 'stopping to smell the roses' and seeing things in an entirely new way. But those copiously detailed descriptions of nature just go on and on and on and on ad infiitum. I knew that with this book story and plot and chacters are perhaps secondary, but there has to be something to connect the narrative and sustain interest, and I just found it lacking.I also hoped that this book would have more and better theological insights, but those that I noted were few and far between and not really moving. Perhaps the book gets better later on and I should have persevered, but time is precious and I just couldn't justify devoting the time needed to finish this book."
3,On and on and on...,"I wanted to like this book so badly. However, I found myself increasingly irritated with it. The observations made and experiences had were pretty awesome and I've done many of the same things. But it was a lot of unnecessary description and rambling. It literally seemed like a manuscript of her thoughts; unorganized, chaotic, sometimes senseless and mundane. I know I know, it's by an incredible author and has awards...but it just isn't worth it. Save yourself the trouble and just go sit by a creek and record some thoughts. Sorry Dillard."
5,One of my favorite reads ever,This is one of the best books I have ever read it reminds me why I enjoy writing. Dillard's writing surely sums up the experience of seeing the universe in a grain of sand.
4,Loved it!,Don Miller mentions it as one of those books that you read a paragraph of and then put away and ponder. Intense writing and thinking. Stream of consciousness type of stuff. Makes me want to spend more time outdoors watching and thinking.
4,Nice book; great price: Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,Book had some binding detachment; borderline Very Good (seller's discription). Price was good and shipping (media mai) was fine.
2,Exhaustive and Mind-Numbing,"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, a novel written by Annie Dillard, was not the most enjoyable piece of literature that I have ever read. The style and structure used by Dillard was advanced, and therefore a bit more challenging to read. This book compared to Walden, by Henry David Thoreau, although much more enjoyable. The story revolved around Tinker Creek, and every single organism that was in or around it. Dillard's similes and descriptions were nothing short of amazing. Her ever present telegraphic sentences seem to set the book off. The transiotions were better than most any author that I have read. However, I would not recommend this book to read unless you would like to punish your children with it."
1,A Great Disappointment,"I too was forced to read this book for an AP English course. In fact, the only reason I finished reading the book was because it was required reading. Except for a few interesting stories and facts (emphasis on FEW), the book is incredibly boring. I live in an area similar to where the book is set, and I still found it uninteresting. A book only for hippies, environmentalists, and people looking to ""find themselves"". Save your money. There are a lot better books out there."
2,Book for People with Big Brains,"The book P at Tc is a very complicated book. I do not suggest that you read it if you do not have time to think about life in general. The read is by far not easy at all. I do not suggest that anyone who is still trying to figure out who they are read it because the book is liable to confuse you even more. The book is good, however, I said earlier-it is an extremely hard read. our AP class read it and i know that my friends and I all stumbled through it."
5,A long time favorite,"This is the book I give go others as moving in or moving out, growing up or growing out gifts. I purchased it while I was in law school as a break from case law. It changed my life. Then, I gave it to my best friend, and her life was changed. I had read a short article with Annie Dillard (Catholic Digest, maybe in 2000 or 2001). Nobody who knew my love of nature had ever read it. . . it's an east coast, west coast thing. But worth being read all over the world."
3,For the Nature Lover,"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is a different kind of book, but unique in its own way. It is an in depth look at nature, and Annie Dillard's experiences in it. Dillard not only looks at the splendor of nature, but she also describes in detail the horrible acts that take place there. This book is not for the faint and lighthearted from that perspective, for there are some extremely graphic scenes. However, after reading past some of the more unpleasant material, Dillard rewards the reader with beautifully written figurative language that gives the book incredible imagery. This book provides food for thought and teaches the reader to look closer at things that may seem insignificant. Pilgrim at Tinker Creek also offers interesting facts and comical stories. In all, the book is well written. I like to think of it as a stepping stone to the more complex and philosophical book, Walden. For the nature lover and budding transcendentalist, this is an excellent book."
4,She flies her sentences like a kite.,"I enjoyed it immensely, even if its sentences are overwrought often to an annoying degree. I appreciate how she looks at the world in poetry: the world is a painting, and we are the poets charged with understanding it. The thing about Dillard is that in spite of the fact that her uber-emotive imagination stands in that place in her brain where my philosopher/mathematician stands in mine, she can still ask brilliant--even terrible--questions without all of the normal dillusions about what the alternative answers really are.There are downsides: the overdone sentences, the fact that not every chapter drove forward toward the point--or even manifested her goal. But one reads her and agrees, at the end of it, that yes, she earned that Pulitzer after all.And to all of the ""bright AP English"" students out there, for goodness sake put the book down and leave the book reviews alone. It just isn't for you. Pick it up again once you've lived some more of life."
3,Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,I bought this book for my daughter. She had to read it for school so it wasn't something she picked herself.
5,Beautiful Writting,This is an invigorating read. It got me thinking in new directions and helped clear away the cobwebs left by the daily working grind. I will probably keep this book beside my bed and read a passage here and there at random from time to time.
1,THE WORST,"What kind of book is this? A description of some grass needles, a tree and a praying mantis. You can analyze all the hidden meanings you want, but where now does that get you? Don't waste the time or money, Pulitzer means not a thing."
2,I Can Not STAND This Book,"This book is definantly suited for those who enjoy both abstract and natural literature. Personally, I despise both, so I did not enjoy this book.However, I did find her secular arguements pretty interesting. Other than that though, I'd give this book a miss."
5,Genius!,"For all lovers and admirers of Henry David Thoreau, this book is a great revival and devlopment of the general love of nature that seems all too lacking in our society today. Dillard's prose is so unique, she is one of the very best! Every line reads like poetry, using eloquent words and uncovering deep epiphanies about life. It's a fresh look at nature and the philosophy of mankind in our place on this earth."
4,"great content, poor disk quality",Babylon 5 is a great series with well-developed characters and plot - I heartily recommend it. The publisher is a little sloppy though - two of the disks in the set arrived scratched.
4,B5 - 3rd season DVD's,"Packaging was weak and had some plastic broken that holds the disks, otherwise DVD's worked fine, no issues. Show is great!"
4,Great Series,"Season 3 is probably the best of the 5. About 8 top quality episodes, and even some of the poorer eps like Grey 17 probably ain't as bad as you first remembered them.JMS commentary is ok with a few interesting tidbits. The cast commentary is more enjoyable on Episode 15.The only things I've discovered is that the transfer ranges from great to shoddy. Some scenes look as though they were filmed through a haze filter. I've no idea what source they encoded the dvd's from, but no chance in hell was it a pristine master. Way too many grainy and poorly encoded scenes for it to be.It would have been interesting to hear from the 2 best actors - Pete Jurasik and Andreas, even Michael O'Hare."
5,Classic B5,"review of S3 Ep20 And the Rock Cried out, No Hiding Placethis is a fantastic Ep. Londo concludes his business with Lord Reffa (sp?)not to mention showing Vir a little more of what Londo is capable of. all with the backdrop of the senior staff of B5 trying to give everyone a little lighter mood with everything that has been going on with the War.as always, the writing and Character development is outstandingSoT"
3,Nothing to brag about,"This movie does not rate highly among others of it's genre, however; it was somewhat entertaining.The seller lived up to his promise of timeliness of delivery and good condition of the item.Thanks"
5,Puts NIST/FEMA reports to shame,"This is a superior film, that questions the official reports on the collapse of WTC 1,2 and 7.It is without question one of the most compelling 911 documentaries that prove the 3 towers were brought down by controlled demolition. I only wish more people could watch films of this quality, to realise what sort of world we are really living in.There is a complete media blackout on this information, so the majority are being brainwashed with false government reports. Anyone willing to take their gaze from the mainstream media, can see what evil the government are prepared to do to their own people.This is a great starting point for anyone trying to unravel the 911 mystery, as it does not deal in conspiracy theory it just gives you the facts.The information in this film cannot be questioned, and points at the need for a new and honest investigation.Until the truth of 911 is known, we will never be able to put things right."
3,9/11 dvd,"I thought these people would be a bunch of crackpots, but that wasn't the case. They definitely knew their stuff. Very thought provoking and interesting. The scientific information was over my head but I got the general gist of it. It is still hard to imagine it to be true, but definitely worth a look and certainly something to ponder over. We will never know the whole truth about 9/11 I guess, at least not in my lifetime.Liz from Australia"
2,not helpful for women,"the book describes the problems with bicycle seats but does not give any practical infomation about selecting a seat. It is more theory about the problems, than help. In addition, the book focuses on medical problems from bicycle seats for men, but not on thos for women. I would not recommend this if you are looking for a book to help you select the appropriate seat, expecially if you are a woman."
3,"QUINCY AND BIW WOW'S BIRTHDAY ARE NOT ON THE DVD!""!!!","3 stars is good for this dvd because they're lying!!!! Neither Bow wow's birthday nor quincy's are on the dvd""!!!! I bought this just because of quincy and bow wow!! I want my money back""!! Don't believe what the description say because is not trueeee""!!!"
4,LOVE IT BUT.... DVD HAS THINGS MISSING!!!!!,"1st of all people need to CHILLAX!!! I have fun watchinf the spoiled kids and laughing at them THIS SHOW WOULD HAVE BEEN BORING WITH REGULAR PEOPLE******NOW THE DVD*********SEASON 2 HAS 2 EPISODES MISSING!Theme/credit music has been changed from HILARY DUFF's ""Sweet 16"" to something else.GOOD JOB MTV!!! NOT!!!"
2,OK premise - horrid execution,"Like another review(er) before me, I mention the tag line on the box describing a movie that will bring werewolf movies back with a vengeance. Like the review before me, I ask, ""Where is this movie."" I was hoping it would be in the box with the certified promise on the front, but my search must continue.The premise of the movie is OK, there are some good ideas presented. However the execution was horridly poor and werewolf movies were executed with it. I fear that the days of a good monster werewolf movie are gone and this is just another nail in that coffin.I also ask, ""Why do such crummy movies have such cool box art and then not deliver?"" Oh yeah, sales...Please sell me a good movie."
2,Kong puppy teething stick (small),We have had our Dachshund puppy for two weeks now and this particular toy is her least favorite thus far. She has over twelve toys and the only time she has played with it is when I put kibble inside and she didn't play too long. We are curious if she will like it more when she is in full teething mode! No reason to dislike it. It's the perfect size for her and is attractive and made well. I think it's just this dogs choice.
3,Dog enjoys it but messy,"I got a regular kong (puppy size) for my little pup and he loves it. Then I got this teething one since he's chewing everything these days. He loves it too (or is it just the squeeze stuff you put inside he loves?) but I am not as big of a fan. He doesn't really chew it, he just licks the stuff out and it makes a mess. It got all over the carpet and its been hard to explain to him that he has to stay in the tiled room with it when he can take his other kong all over the house (because it doesn't make much of a mess). I think he chews the regular kong more than this one anyway, so while he likes it I would not reccommend. Get the regular Kong and stick with that."
3,"Okay, but messy","My 4 month old yorkiepoo Liked this okay, but it's a little messy. I prefer the kong that you fill INSIDE."
5,"KONG Puppy Teething Stick Dog Toy, Small, Pink",I bought this toy to replaced the one with handle cause my dogs will tear it apart at the weakest link. With this one they can grab the toy but can't pull it apart ha ha ha. If it's a little bit heavier it will be perfect to throw for playing catch a little bit farther.
1,Useless,"Don't get fooled by the good reviews, this toy is completely useless and uninteresting for any dog...several toys with same concept... ONE BIG SCAM!!"
3,Filled it with peanut butter and froze it,but my dog wouldn't touch it. I like the Kong products but this one wasn't a hit as I don't think my dog likes rubber toys.
5,Impressive energy and sound,"I bought this album at their show in Denver. They are a very impressive band to see live with an incredible amount of energy and a unique rock sound. They push it to where they almost sound as if they are about to fall into a cacophonous mess, but then they pull it all back together with even more intensity at the last second. This calculated ebb and flow of energy makes then a unique sound among so many new rock bands in the indie rock resurgence. I highly recommend you check out this album and by all means, catch them live!"
4,"Star Time, baby...",The Joggers position themselves between Hot Hot Heat and The Walkmen. Great stuff; sticky sweet...
2,Nothing like The Mars Volta...,"...contrary to what the reviwer below stated. Too alternative indie to enjoy. Simply, this music isn't that good."
4,Coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool,It is helpful and makes playing fun it is wireless i took it on a plane by it it is very fun u can play on boring trips get it trust me
5,"Bastos' ""Preta Luz"" is a souful expression of his Angola.","Bastos' music transcends borders. His voice emphasizes social and spirtual consciousness. It is a type of AWAKENING. An awakening to a country's history that I knew little about but by the end of the cd I was fully moved. A voice that stresses the importance of LOVE. From the opening song, ""Sofrimento"", to ""Querida Angola"" he intertwines the various African and Latin rythms along w/ his feelings of love, pride, fear, shame, and passion for his homeland. Bastos proclaims himself a ""paradox"", but it is within these paradoxes that he is best able to fuse all these expressions of self. His ""Preta Luz"" is a soulful expression of SELF, and that self is Angola."
3,It is not Renascence...,"Although it has some resemblance to previous CDs, this is not as satisfying. Some of the themes are repeated, but the enthusiasm and resonance are not there. Not bad, but I was expecting more."
3,Waldemar Bastos - Pretaluz,A remarcable record. African ? Yes certainly but with the touch of a Portugese background in the rithms and the melodies. For easy listening and smooth swinging.Bastos is a real artist and I am looking forward to his next album.
5,Solid Quality,Refreshing to listen to good solid quality vocals without the glitz and flash of the current fad of junk music.
1,Not good,"The soup is tasteless and very condense, I couldn't finish even 1 bowl after the first few spoons."
1,Double Trouble,This is a two volume but even though you pay the double amount you only receive one volume. Don't do it!
5,A Species of Initiation,"An entirely unique approach to the Major Arcana, returning us to A Sacred Process available in the Deep Minds of us all.Fine illustrations. A brilliant mind. One can only marvel that the book is so cheap.If you're looking for a book to help you with ""readings,"" this is not the book for you. If you're looking for a book sharing deep insights into Tarot (the reading of which itself is a species of Initiation), this IS the book for you.I've been a student of the Tarot off and on for 40+ years - and canNOT express what a delight it was to find this book."
2,Dangerous mounting hardware,"When I saw this baby seat on Amazon I got very excited. Riding with my baby between my arms with both of us watching the road ahead seemed like a lot of fun. Plus, all the customer reviews reassured me this was the best I could get.However, once I got it I noticed the mounting hardware, particularly the stinger -- a 7-inch steel bar where the seat slides for mounting/dismounting -- would represent a lot of trouble.Sure enough, once installed the stinger sits right in front of you and it simply is too dangerous to have a 7-inch steel bar pointing at you when you ride. You just won't be able to use your bike without the baby seat on.This is a serious disadvantage over back-mounted baby seats which can easily be dismounted for riding solo.I hope new prospective buyers find this information useful."
1,Unsafe at any speed!,"This is not a safe product. I do not know what I was thinking. After riding twice with my daughter in this, I am getting rid of it. She did not enjoy it and just kept trying to turn around to see mommy, and I was white-knuckled trying to keep the bicycle under control. It was extremely difficult to maneuver with her seated up there. This is not for us! I have come to my senses."
1,CPSC CERT?,"I started seeing these child seats about 6 months ago and could not belive that these are being sold stateside. The has to be the worst idea for trasporting children since just riding on the handlebars. It is hard to imagine that any parent would strap their own child to the front of a bike and ride. This is just a bad idea. For any parent who is considering buying any child seat, please look at either a trailer of just getting them self propelled on their own bike. Remember, these seats are mounted higher and your center of gravity will be affected as well as changing the handling of your bike. 25-35 lbs will make your bike unstable regardless of your ability and skill level. If you go down, they go down. Having been in the bicycle industry for 20 years and being a parent myself I feel that this product should be banned. Thanks for reading & be safe!"
5,"Great so far, but a little warning for people who are not big riders, like me . . .","I got this for my son, and I will say it is comfortable for him, extremely easy to install, and over all a very good product. My son is 2 and 25 lbs, so I know I only get to use this for one season. I don't think I've got the straps adjusted quite right for him, but I think that is MY issue, not the seat's.I am NOT a big bike rider. My husband gave me an Electra Townie (love it) for my birthday. The seat works really well on it, I have no problem with knee clearance (but I am short) but as a rather novice rider, having all that extra weight in front of me makes riding - especially getting going and turning - much more challenging. I'm getting more used to it, but I just thought I'd report.I really like being able to talk to my son and point out things to him as we're riding. He loves it."
5,it's grrrrrrrreaaat!,"I love this bike seat! It's positioned just right for it to not throw the bike off balance. My son and I go biking almost everyday and he loves it. I thought the plastic would be uncomfortable when I saw it too, but it doesn't bother him in the slightest bit. My son is 16 months old and gets excited when he hears me grab the bike, he even tries to help me load him in! In which case I wish the bar would snap upright for loading because he grabs it to try and snap it closed himself and usually hits my hand when I'm trying to buckle him in. It's so relaxing for him, he even falls asleep on his rides. I feel very comfortable riding with him, I'm 5'2"" and I don't have any problem with my knees hitting it. I always get looks of surprise and smiles when they see my son riding in his seat, kids passing by love it too. I would DEFINITELY recommend this everyone."
5,Great seat for toddlers!,"We were looking for an option where our daughter would be in front of the bike.This is perfect: Easy to install, great stability when riding, and fits our little one well."
4,This seat is great!,"This seat was pretty easy to put together and my child loves being in the front of the bike. The seat provides a nice place for a child's legs, meaning there is really no way they will get tangled up in the bike at all. The only thing I don't really like is you have to watch your knees sometimes on the bottom of the seat."
4,Fun seat!!,This seat is easy to put on (take off) and is great for recreation. I am training for a triathlon and I don't feel comfortable taking my daughter on the bike at faster speeds I also have to turn out my knees slightly when riding the bike. This isn't a good seat for serious riding. I will stick to fun rides around the neighborhood.
5,Absolutley Love it!,"My 15 month old daughter loves it. She runs to the bike just to let me know that she wants to go for a ride.Many heads turn when they see the seat and ask here I got it from.Plenty of leg room for me, 5'7"" on an Earth Cruiser. Very easy to install and haven't had any issues in 10 rides with it."
5,"Great, great and once again great !",I bought that seat for my 11 months old son . Is working just great and he is really enjoying bike rides. He is safe and we feel secure being able to se him all the time. Nothing is blocking his view and he loves to see everything in front of him. Installation was easy and took my husband only 10 minutes. That is the best seat you can find in my opinion and is worth every cent.
5,Daughter Loves the View,"Our daughter has been riding in this for almost a year now, and she loves it. In the meantime she has grown several inches and a few pounds, and now at 26 months she's still loving it.We got an extra mounting bar so we could easily move the seat from one bike to another, making it easier for either Mom or Dad to take her out.Great bike seat, gives her a great view, she loves it! We do too."
5,Best Child Seat for Bike Idea - Very Safe,"Originally was a bit skeptical about having a child seat on the handlebars but it actually turned out to be easier to balance than one that affixes to the back of a bicycle. (Think of those 'paperboy' days and carrying your friends on the handlebars as a kid) After taking an inaugural spill, the protection of being able to throw your arms around the child makes me a firm believer in this seat. It means so much more to have your hands right there in an emergency. Our 9-month old loves riding on it.It's easy to install and easy to remove, when not in use. 3-point harness and a lap bar make for a very secure ride even over bumpy terrain.The only drawback I have is the need to have a second adult assist with loading / unloading. It is downright hazardous for a single adult to load / unload a child unless the bicycle can be secured without actually being on it."
5,ibert front mounted bicycle seat,this is a great bicycle seat. my daughter is almost two and she fits in it well. she loves being on the front of the bike and i love being able to see her and talk to her. it was easy to install and it's easy to get her in and out.
2,Check your handlebar stems first,Despite al the research I did online the ibert did not fit correctly on either of our bikes. My mountainbike stem does not extend as shown in the instruction photos. I managed to install it on our beach cruiser but couldn't turn the handlebars more than a few degrees before it hit the side of the ibert. Because of the shape of the wide beach cruiser handlebars turning was dangerously limited.
2,not good for taller bikers,"I loved the idea of the i-bert. Not available anywhere locally, I had to order it online and was thrilled to find it for a decent price on ebay. This turned to disappointment. I am 5'7"" and I need to have my saddle on the lowest setting in order to safely ride with the ibert installed. Which makes it very uncomfortable to paddle and I am not able to use it for any kind of longer trips. Otherwise with the saddle at the correct height for me, it's almost even with the ibert and I am not able to get safely and quickly on and off the saddle, because there is not enough space between the ibert and the saddle when they are almost at the same height. If you are shorter, this might work for you, as your saddle would be at a low setting anyway. Maybe it's also the type of bike I have, but I am not going to get a different bike to accommodate a child's bike seat ..."
5,Smartest Child-Bike Seat Ever!!! The reviews are right...,"We (my 17 month old son & I) absolutely love this seat. It fit perfectly on my K2 mountain bike and doesn't get in the way while I'm pedaling. He feels really comfortable and has a blast as we cruise through the neigborhood and parks. People always look on in awe when they see us cruising by...and when people comment, I'm sure to let them know what the Ibert Safe-T Seat is and where I got mine (Amazon...of course). This seat is pure genius, safe and a whole lot of fun!Remember though, slap a helmet on your little one whenever on the bike...it could save his/her life if you're ever in an accident or wipe out."
1,Make sure it fits your bike before ordering,"I read a lot of reviews about this seat and they all had positive comments, I ordered this product and found out it didn't fit correctly in my bike and when I finally got to install it, I could only ride straight, I couldn't turn and i had to return it. Make sure it fits before ordering."
4,Love this seat!,"I love this product but it does have one drawback. My son is nowhere near the weight capacity but he is almost too tall for it. It is difficult to get him in and out of the seat. However, once he is in he absolutely loves it. It was also very easy to install. I would highly recommend this product!"
4,"Great Purchase, easy to install and use...!","It is very easy to install, and works great.The only drawback, as stated in other reviews, is that my baby feet's got stuck during the boarding process.Other than that, she enjoys the ride a lot!"
5,BEST BIKE SEAT EVER,"This is a fantastic product! My daughter LOVES going for bike rides, pointing out every mailbox, fire hydrant, tree, etc. that she sees and looking up at mommy for acknowledgement! I can actually converse with her and keep an eye on her. It's such a great bonding experience as well. And the bike is so easy to handle with the seat attached. We're looking forward to warmer weather so we can make full use of it!!"
5,Excellent Seat- I love it!,I absolutely love this seat! I read all the reviews on so many seats and am positive I chose the right one. It was extremely easy and fast to attach to my bike and is quick and easy to take off if you need to. (Unlike the seats that attach in the rear.) I have no problem seeing over my one year old's head with a helmet and have no problem steering. It is actually easier to ride him in the front than the back and he sits longer since he has a great view! My son loves this seat and so do I. I would buy it over and over again. Well worth every penny!
1,Seat Didn't Fit Mountain Bike,"I am 5' 4"" and have a Raleigh Women's Mountain bike that was not compatible with the iBert. When installed, my infant's legs were underneath the gear shifts, so I couldn't shift gears. I modified my handlebars to raise them, but that didn't make much difference. In addition, I could not ride without really bumping my knees (it was not a minor inconvenience). There was also no way to safely mount or dismount the bike because there wasn't enough clearance between the iBert and my seat. When coming to a stop, I couldn't put my feet on the ground and had to really lean to one side and balance on the toes of one foot. Too bad, I was really excited about this product. I think how well it works is 100% dependent on the adult's bike frame - and I have no doubt that if it did fit my frame, I would have given the product 4 stars. iBert should give some instruction as to frame sizes that are iBert compatible."
2,Not great for smaller people,"We were pretty excited to try this device out. So we decided to buy a really nice commuter bike since this would not work on my wife's road bike.Unfortunately after installing this, we had to lower the seat post all the way down, and the ride is still not comfortable. The ibert is placed as far forward as it can be, and the saddle is placed as far back as possible. The problem is there's not a large enough gap between the saddle and the ibert if my wife needs to stop without tilting the bike a lot.We contacted the company, and they said that this was a problem for many smaller bikes. At the time of purchase (and now) there was no mention that this might be an issue on the web site.We might experiment a bit with this, but we may end up having to re-sell this, and purchase a rear-mounted bike seat. I think this product would be great on a larger bike, my child truly does love it."
1,Not good for shorter women / men,"I love the idea of this seat but it does not work for shorter women or men. I am 5'3"" and attached to my mountain bike. I only had a couple of inches between the back of the iBert seat and my seat. It was impossible to stop safely because there was no room between me and the seat. To stop, you would need to lean sideways on one leg and tilt the bike significantly.I had a male friend who is 5'7"" and he had difficulty stopping for the same reason. Definitely make sure this seats your bike and your body frame before purchasing.I don't write reviews often but this seat offers limited compatibility for smaller frames."
3,Didn't work very well for me,"I installed this seat on my three-speed Raleigh. I'm six-feet, and still found that there was not enough room for me to ride comfortably. My knees bumped and rubbed against the seat. I also had to raise my stem about 3 inches to keep the ibert seat from hitting my top tube because the seat mount sloped down from the stem. I think if I had a bike with a longer reach from seat to headset, and a sloping top tube, it might have fit better.I'm also sorry to say I found it very ugly.I gave three stars because it is such a joy to ride with my one-year old in the seat. He found it comfortable and loves riding with me. If it were my only option, I might have just put up with it for the sake of being able to ride with him.After more research, I tried the Bobike mini+ seat, and it fits and works much better for my bike. I've returned the ibert, and now ride very happily with the Bobike."
5,IBert - Love it!,"I was looking for a different method to take my little one for a bike ride and don't like the pull behind systems.I love this front mounted seat. It's a little difficult to take off in a stand still position -- but she loves it, and it's nice to have her next to me while riding!"
5,best kids bike seat,"everyone, and I mean everyone loves the iBert. Our 11-month-old loves her bike rides in this seat. Fantastic product."
4,We Love it!,"I was so excited to find a front mounted bicycle seat for our son. I read several reviews that said the leg room was a problem; but I didn't experience that at all on my hybrid bike (and I am 5'10""); and that the seat is too small - but that wasn't an issue for us either even with our very tall almost two year old. My son loves being able to see where we are going and I feel a lot safer having him so close to me. The only thing that is a little bit of a hassle is the pin that holds the seat in place. It is difficult to put on and take off - I keep a pair of pliers with me and it helps a lot. I would recommend this seat to anyone."
5,Great bike seat!,"This is a great bike seat. My son loves riding up front and seeing everything. Plus, he doesn't get the kick back of dirt like he would in a bike trailer. He's been using it since he was about 10 months old."
3,Sleepy baby,I just bought the iBert to use with my 10 month old. We have had it for a little over a month now and use it frequently. I love the concept of the iBert and overall it is a good product. My only issue with it is that when the child is riding in the iBert it is set at such a recline that they appear to be very uncomfortable. I feel like my son is folded in half when he rides in it and when he falls asleep in it (almost every ride) I have to immediately turn around because he smashes his face on the crossbar at even the slightest bump. If the seat sat the child up straighter and had a higher back on it the child would probably be more comfortable.
3,Could have easily been much better.,"1) The ibert should have metric hardware, so you don't have to carry an extra tool to constantly tighten the poorly designed clamp. The folks that designed this could have looked at how bikes are put together, and designed a clamp that works. As it is, it only fits on one out of our four bikes.2) A 5 point harness or something similar that doesn't require adjustment to get over baby's giant helmet head would make loading and unloading a lot easier. Like a car seat, over the shoulders and click together.3) Riding with the ibert is pretty awkward. I have to have my feet on the outside halves of the pedals, and my knees splayed apart, to keep from bumping the seat with my knees.We have been using the ibert for a couple of years and it just kinda sucks. With a little thought and redesign it could be much more user friendly."
2,Not enough space for me!,"This is the first time in a long time that I regret the purchase I made on amazon. With the seat installed, there isn't enough room for me to comfortably fit behind the child seat. I am about 5'6"" and have a smaller womens bike (Breezer brand), so maybe that's part of it. Also, there is very little space for my child's legs. The handle bars really pin him in. I don't like this front mounted design at all.I should mention that my child loves it - riding up front with a steering wheel. But it's just too unsafe for me to ride."
4,Great Seat but doesn't fit on every bike,"This is a great seat and a great concept!! Unfortunately, it doesn't fit my husband's bike very well (Raleigh Mountain Bike) as it won't allow him to shift gears when it's on. No amount of adjusting has solved the problem. However, it fits my women's Raleigh Hybrid bike great! I love being able to talk to my daughter while we're riding and her movements don't throw off my balance. My knees don't hit the seat and it's very easy to steer the bike with her on it. She LOVES riding in it!!!! Overall, great seat! Just wish it fit my husband's bike, too! Definitely recommend it to see if it fits your bike!"
3,I love the concept but the design is tough at times,First I have to say my son hated the bike trailer and he loves this seat. That is very important and we use this thing several times a week. The downside is that the buckle is to wideset and it makes me nervous when I see it fall off my sons shoulder while we are riding. I have tried all sorts of adjustments but I feel like there should be a way to adjust the width in the back. Also water collects in the seat. We went for a rain ride and the water was pooled at his feet. I will probably just drill some holes in the seat to prevent that.Good seat concept all in all.
1,NO GOOD for fuji cross comp or like!!!,"SO SAD. i wanted both my boys on my bike with me, and this product was so built up but didnt even come close to work! im athletic, strong and healthy, even adventurous, but there was about 8 inches between my seat and the ibert, and my chin would rest on my sons forehead if i could reach the handle bars! where i bought it, the guy didnt even let me get out what type of bike i had, he said it worked with all bikes. but seriously i could not reach the handle bars at all! not even close, they are below my sons knees!"
3,Didn't fit our bikes,"We really like the idea, but it fit neither of our bikes, even though they're both supposedly compatible - a hybrid and a mountain bike, both full-size, pretty standard, mid-range bikes. We are both year-round bicycle commuters who log thousands of miles on our bikes. On the hybrid it got in the way of her knees and she couldn't mount the bike or straddle it any more, and on my mountain bike it interfered with the gear shift levers and put the kid's head in my chin.I suspect this seat is really designed for ""low-end"" bikes with high handlebars, or for weekend casual riders who have their bikes adjusted for ""comfort"" rather than good riding."
4,Great Bike Seat,"This bike seat is great! We love the stability of this seat compared to others, when our little guy is in it. He has a bird's eye view and loves being in it. It's sturdy and feels of good quality. We prefer this seat to a trailer as we feel safer and more visible to other road users.The only cons are sometimes your knees hit the sides when pedalling and the straps need a little bit of fiddling to get them secure. Other than that, it's great!"
4,FANTASTIC! but unsafe shoulder straps,"We all love this bike seat, my husband, me , and especially our daughter. It is great in every way, easy to install, comfortable and fun for the baby, comfortable for the adult, and easy to take off. BUT, and I think this is a kind of important but, the shoulder straps are set to far apart, so that she is not really securely straped in. They slide of and just don't hit her shoulders in the right spot. Maybe it's just my daughter, but I really don't think so....other than that we LOVE it."
2,Knee-bashing disappointment,"I was very excited for the first use of the iBert, based on the benefits outlined by its front-of-bike design. But, my excitement quickly turned to great disappointment as my knees bang the bottom of the iBert on every pedal. I now have to choose between inefficient bow-legged riding, or a return of the item. I am 6'1 with long legs and perhaps that poses a problem for the design of this product. So, if you are an experienced and efficient biker and are looking to maintain your good body position, you may want to reconsider.Tim -- Denver, CO"
1,Not enough clearance between my saddle and the iBert,"I looked at several other front mounted seats like the BoBike, Yepp Mini, and an old Hamax and it seemed like this one would work best with my bike (cross bike with threadless headset). But I have a smaller frame bike for my height (5'8"") since like many women, I have a fairly short torso and longer legs - compared to male proportions. The seat mounted easily but when I tried to test ride it, I could not get on and off the bike - there was not enough space between my seat and the child seat. Not even close! Very disappointed. I finally got on but then my knees hit the iBert. The manufacturer should give a minimum distance needed between the stem and saddle so that those of us with smaller frames won't waste time."
3,nice light seat but back not high enough,"The seat was easy to install, is nice and light and it is easy to ride my bike with my daughter in the seat. The only problem is the back is not high and every time I have gone for a bike ride with her in this seat she has fallen asleep on my arm which is pretty uncomfortable. There is no support for a child to fall asleep in the seat so she just slumps forward and uses my arm as a pillow. I wish the back was higher to allow a child to fall asleep comfortably so I could go for a longer ride."
5,Ibert safe-t front mounted child bike seat,I bought this product to put on my Mountain Bike for my 18 month old son. He absolutely loves it and he gets so excited when I get home from work so we can go on a bike ride. There's nothing better than seeing your child so happy and excited.great product!
5,iBert Safe-T,"I bought this for my husband to put on his bike and he loves it. Knowing that he can see our daugther makes him feel so much more comfortable. Now that we have, I swear I see one on every bike now! Our daughter loves it too! She gets a front seat ride to see everything! :)"
5,LOVE this thing!!,We just love this bike seat...our 2 yr old loves it and everyone we come in contact with seems to be impressed as well :) I do not have good balance (seriously....I'm a klutz!) but this makes your center of gravity a lot stronger. And my toddler loves being up front where he can wave at everyone! He'll sit in it for hours riding with me. Turns are a little different with it on there but you really get used to it fast. Everyone who sees it is amazed and they say what a great idea it is and ask me all sorts of questions!
4,Will outgrow in length before weight,"I've been using the Ibert for two seasons. I love it. My son loves it. Unfortunately, he will be outgrowing the seat in length way before he will outgrow it in weight. He is almost 2 1/2, weighs 29 lbs, and is 37"". His feet are already touching the ends of the seat. In hindsight, the BoBike Mini front mounted bike seat may have been a more long lasting option as the feet pegs are adjustable, even though the weight limit is less than the Ibert.I did have to install a riser on my mountain bike stem in order to get enough clearance under the seat for my legs. It is still a really tight squeeze getting on and off the bike if you have your seat adjusted for optimum performance/comfort (vs. with your feet touching the ground while seated).You do not feel the weight of the child and your steering is not affected. Pretty amazing, actually.I am female, 5'6""."
2,"Great Seat, Old Model","There were no specifications indicating the model, which ended up not being the current model (the current model is a 2010 to the present and I purchased this in April 2011). This model has a shorter leg length than the current model. Be sure to distinguish between the model being sold and the model you want. Your kids can stay in the seat longer if you get the current model. It is still a great product, but I am frustrated with Amazon for selling me an old model."
5,"My son loves it, and so do I!","I highly recommend this seat!! I'll admit, my husband and I ended up having to swap bikes because for some reason we couldn't get it on my bike (my handlebars don't lower/raise, but I think that is rare), but now that we have it installed we absolutely love it! My son is 21 months, and his new favorite phrase is ""bike ride, bike ride"" because he loves it so much. I was a little worried about how the handling, balance, and overall safety would be, but it actually feels much safer to me than a back-mount seat. There are no balance issues, and they are somewhat protected by your arms/chest; in addition, it makes talking/communicating with them much easier so you're not turning around to try to talk to them, which again makes it safer.Overall, we are extremely happy with the purchase!"
4,LOVIN THE VIEW,I bought this as an alternative to the bike trailer. I like that it is in front and gives my two year old a great view while we ride. I have a trek mountain bike; and I did have to make a few adjustments to my handle bars and gears in order to get the seat to fit comfortably on the bike. Overall it is a great seat! As long as you are familiar with making adjustments to your ride; your kiddo will love their ride :)
5,Excellent Product,"I bought the ibert few weeks ago and I am loving it! My daughter is 15 months, and she enjoys it a lot. I am not particularly athletic, I am 5'-7"" and I have a hybrid bike. The ibert is easy to install. Easy to get the child in and out of it, and when you ride, you don't even notice the extra weight. I like the fact that my daughter is in the front because that provides better control of the bike than if she was in a rear seat. Also, I can see her through the mirror. The only problem is that she wants to manouver the bike and keeps trying to take my hands off the handles! This product is excellent. I would suggest the manufacturer to make the inserts for the strap in the back a little bit more close together, so the strap sits well on the child's shoulders."
5,iBert Child Bicycle Seat,"This seat is AWESOME! It is easy to install, the child loves it and the parent riding the bike loves it because you can still ride the bike and have the interaction with the child. This is much better than a rear seat and makes a bike ride much more enjoyable."
3,Not for smaller people,"I loved this bike seat until my daughter turned 14 months.Now if you read the instructions, you are not supposed to put them in it until they are 1 so I only had a couple of months(per direction) to ride with her until she got to big and I couldn't reach around her very well.Sold it on Crag's list,but only to some one who was much bigger than me."
5,iBert Front Mounted Bike Seat - family delight,"We learned of this product at REI when our infant was too small yet. Purchased at a great price through Amazon for his 1 year old birthday. Now mama rides to the delight of both little boys (8yr and 1yr)! Having raised two other babies, using traditional rear mounted seats - there is just no comparison to the confidence and communication and FUN of having my little one literally within kissable distance of me.The single thing I don't like about this is when the seat is removed (if I'm not riding with my child) the exposed mount is a sharp metal piece that literally gouges my thigh whenever I turn. If I rode much at all without my child, I would remove the mount as well which is really contrary to the ease of design."
4,Great!,"Love this seat! I love how my son is right in front of me, between my arms. He loves to look around and see more than my back! If given the choice again, I would still go with the ibert over the back bike seat. The only negative is sometimes on a ride, my son falls asleep in the seat. This seat back is low and his head wobbles all over the place. That would be true for all front bike seats, and I think the pros outweigh this one con."
4,"Great product, fast install, and great design!","I spent about three days reviewing all the different types of bike carriers after purchasing a $30.00 rear Bell carrier from Walmart that did not fit on our bike and was designed poorly. I was a little hesitant with the price but we are so glad we purchased the IBert. It took literaly two minutes to install on my bike (hybrid Scwhinn sp?) compared to the 40 minutes it took to figure out the rear carrier did not even fit ours.Our daughter absolutley LOVES it! She's 23 months, 21 lbs, about 32 inches and fits well with room to grow. We love being able to point things out and talk to her on our rides. We hear ""wwwwweeeee"" ""more fast"" and ""me bike"" constantly. Like others, a tantrum was had when we stopped!Only rated 4 stars for the strap, could be designed a little better but overall everything is 5 stars!"
2,Beware: Can Make Biking Difficult/Unsafe,"I was pleasantly surprised with the simplicity of this seat and its easy mounting bracket. Took seconds to hook up. Unfortunately, it was very hard to ride the bike after the seat was in place. I had to shimmy into place on the bike seat and my knees would hit the iBert as I pedaled. Made it very treacherous to stop and extricate yourself from under the iBert. Also didn't work for my wife. We have pretty standard path/pavement bikes--mine's a Raleigh C30 and hers a Giant--so I'm not sure how this seat works for others. It has been returned and we are happy with our cheapy rear-mounted child seat."
5,Awesome product!,This is the best front mount anywhere! It is so easy to put on and very sturdy! My baby loves it and crys when we take her out!
4,iBert bicycle seat,"Our son (19 months) loves this seat! He wants to go for a ride every time he sees it. It is nice for him to be able to see where he is going and hold onto my handlebars like he is actually riding the bike! The only complaint my husband and I have is the lack of leg room. We put a longer, more angled stem on the bike to make it more upright(we have it on a mountain bike), but we still hit our knees on the back of the ibert. We are both tall 5'10"" so we have to pedal with our knees out which is uncomfortable. It might work better on a hybrid or cruiser bike. All in all it was a great purchase and we are having a lot of fun with it!"
3,Good but tough for stopping and starting,I really do like this however my biggest issues is that it's tough to get on and off my bike. I'm physically fit and have thought that someone overweight would have major issues. It's just that when I'm riding along with the 3 y/o along side us (me and the 18 month old in the ibert) we have to stop at every intersection and getting on and off is a pain! Once I'm on it's great! So that's my only thought....
5,Best little baby bike seat!!,"This little seat is worth taking the time to review! I looked at every bike seat out there and read every review I could get my hands on before we settled on the iBert. My baby is almost 9 months old and I've had the seat a couple of weeks. She loves it! She is small-average 8-9month size. It fits her. The low back on the seat allows her head to be above it so it doesn't push her helment forward when we are riding. She can reach the lap bar so she has something to hold onto. Super Super easy to install- took like 5 minutes- REALLY. I have a crusier bike, so I didn't have to worry about leg room. I am shorter, and was worried about keeping my balance with her on a bike, and it is barely noticable when she is on it with me. Doesn't affect the balance of the bike at all! She loves it and so do we!! It gives all 5 of us in the family the opportunity to get out on our bikes together. I would buy it again, hands down."
4,Love this seat!,"This is an excellent seat. It is very easy to install and I love that my girl is right in front of me on the rides. It doesn't feel at all like she is unsteady in it and the straps are very similar to a 3-point restraint. You don't have to put the helmet on after they are strapped in because there is an individual clip for each shoulder strap. My only complaint is that the shoulder straps actually go over her upper arms as opposed to her shoulder for whatever reason. Regardless, she seems comfortable. I would definitely recommend this seat."
4,Love it,"Our 18 month old daughter loves this. It feels totally safe and fits our bike perfectly. The only thing about front bike seats in general is if your a short person, seeing over the helmet might be hard. or a tall person might have to open knees wider to keep from hitting them on the seat. Im 5'5 and it was perfect though. i would and do recommend this product"
5,Great Product!!!,"This is a wonderful product. My 26 month old daughter loves to now ride on the bike. We had a trailer that we put her in when she was quite small but as she got older, she did not enjoy biking and therefore, neither did mom and dad. We needed to find something that would allow her to be a part of the experience, and this product does just that. I feel quite comfortable about the safety and stability compared to other products especially those mounted on the back of the bike. My husband is a rather large man at 6'2"" and he has no problems with hitting the seat. We would definitely recommend this product!"
5,We love it!,It's an awesome bike seat. Very easy to install and to remove. Our baby loves riding in it!
5,Best Purchase Ever in A Long Time,"I truly enjoy this product,I just bought it a few weeks ago and even though I heard that it only goes up to 32 pounds and my daughter is 28lbs when I bought it. The carrier is still worth every penny even if I can not use it for much longer."
5,Awesome for both parents and toddlers,I bought the iBert Safety Seat from Amazon (much cheaper than at the actual iBert site) as a Father's Day gift for my husband. He installed it in literally 5 minutes but he had to raise the bike's handle bar to fit the seat properly. My 15 month old ABSOLUTELY loves sitting in the front of the bike! The strap is a little hard to adjust but we learned to put it on first before putting on her helmet. I would definately recommend this to anyone!
2,Broke the first time the bike fell over,"Initially I loved this seat, it was easy to install, the directions were simple to follow. My seventeen month daughter used it eight times before the bike fell over one day in the wind. The bike landed and the child seat broke clean off the bar that attaches to the bike. I couldn't believe how weak the bar was, I understand if the seat was made so that the bar would break if the child was sitting in the seat during a crash but my daughter wasnt even in the seat, and it wasnt a crash, the bike tipped over and fell and it didn't even fall hard. Was the bar faulty? I will not be buying another. Its too bad since my girl loved using the seat. Any recommendations for another seat?"
1,Too bad.,This product was difficult to use. I did not feel that I had the control I needed to have while riding with my daughter. I would not use this product again as I do not feel it is safe.
5,QUESTION,can someone tell me if this would work for a younger child? My daughter is 8 months now (May 2011) and I would like to use this with her this summer. Or should I just wait until next year when she's older?
5,Excelente,"es un buen asiento me divierto mucho con mi hijo altamente recomendable !Lastima que tiene un limite en peso, tienes que tener un buen espacio en el maniubro para la instalacion de ahi en fuera esta exelente!"
2,"Fun, but....","When we first got this it was alot of fun. The kids love being in front. The problems I had with it was that the kids legs are right up against the handle bars (we have mountain bikes). This also made it hard to get the kids in and out. Also, our kids are fairly tall, and the legs of the seat don't go too far down, so they out grew it very fast. Our kids are also very thin...but if they were bigger, I can't imagine them fitting in this too comfortably. Also, wehen they fall asleep, there's no head rest, so their heads would kind of flop around. At one point, I had to take one hand to support my son's head.I'm not going to go through the safety pros and cons of having them up front versus the back. I think in the end it's your personal comfort."
5,Inspirational and Entertaining,"If you are working out and you are looking for something to make you want to go to the gym, watch this movie. It is well worth the price, especially if you like AANOLD."
5,Pumped up......,"Recieved the dvd right away. No hassle deal.Great DVD. Arnold ""Conan"" and Lou ""THE HULK"" Facing Off. Fun to watch.. Good motivation... Time to Get Serious"
5,Keeps you inspired never to give up.,"I really love this film from 1977 about bodybuilding.I started working out and I can see the results already.Some days I just want to quit ,I just watch this film to keep myself motivated .You can see all the pain and sweat the bodybuilders go through.In the end it's all worth all the pain you feel great after."
5,surrealistic masterpiece,"This unreal piece of film plays with the mind, you are captured in awe of the work ethic of the man with the greatest physique of the century. Your eyes will open wide when you see how large his body can become when stressed to the limits and beyond. I have been fortunate enough to live with a guy who owns a copy and we have seen it many times. With each viewing, the mind is still amazed at what this man was able to accomplish, and it is funny too! Five stars, without a doubt."
4,Arnold loves the Pump!,"Weird, documentary style film that shows the original days of body building in the steroid era. These guys are freaks of nature ( well maybe not so natural!) All these guys do is body build, go to shows, show off, and body build some more. Arnold was the king, or at least that is what the movie contends. Lou Ferigno is the underdog. Best scene in the whole movie is the guy who is standing behind Lou at the gym with his pot belly lifting 5 pounds weight looking like he is half asleep, while Lou is lifting hundreds of pounds. I want to know where that guy is today....This movie is a cult classic and is a must see for anyone who has ever trained, for any type of sport."
5,Arnie is a self made man,"My opinion about this DVD.This is next to no documentary, yes it is a dramatic and funny dvd. I saw the inflicted insecurities on Louie Ferrigno by big Arnie. I could not believe the acting Arnie put on the DVD. ""Franco is a child, he comes to me for advices .."" <--- hahahahahaha The camaraderie that took place is awesome. After all, this docudrama dvd really shows another world. Worth watching it as an inspirational bibliography for all of us."
3,dvd,My husband got this for christmas he loves arnold but wasn't that impressed with this dvd he said it had some good stuff some bad
5,Gift,"I don,t know how the film is because I bought it for a gift for someone. They couldn,t find this anywhere but I was able to get it here, just as advertised, great price, and fast shipping."
5,"gift for son-in-law, He loved it, Pumping Iron 25th Anv.","Son-in-law really liked it, he is a weight lifting lover."
5,The bain of bodybuilding,See why Arnold became a star in this movie about bodybuilding. His personality shines through as he competes for the Mr. Olympia title against his new rival Lou Ferrigno. Arnold explains how important it is push yourself to become a champion in the sport. Great inter-personal stories between competitors and great film making.
5,Pumping Iron Review,"Look, I personally think Arnold Scwarzenegger is awesome and while many people know him from his films which I actually like very much especially his earlier ones where his physical prowess was more played up I actually think he is the most incredible body builder of all time and getting to see a behind the scenes look was great."
4,Funny and a great insight into Arnold,"I have watched this DVD many, many times over the years and still find it very interesting. It's even funnier now that he's the governor of my state. This is a great glimpse into Arnold and his razor sharp intelligence. Most people don't realize how smart Arnold is until you watch this DVD. He dominated the bodybuilding sport not only because of his physique, but also because of the mental dominance he held over the other competitors. A great example of this can be seen on the DVD with how he interacts with Lou Ferrigno, and is able to thoroughly get into Lou's head crushing down just a little more of his confidence. Although Lou's father didn't help either. This is a must watch film for any Arnold fan, or anyone who lives in California and would like to know the type of guy our new Governor is. Oh yeah, and the pot smoking scene is hilarious(read the shirt)!"
5,This is the ultimate Arnold bodybuilding movie,I have seen this movie over 15 times. Every time I can't help but go to the gym after watching it. Arnold was the best. This movie just shows how incredible he was.
5,Good DVD,"This is cool. Lots of old school Body builders from that historical circle from the 70's.Arnold toaking a hooter right after he retires. Just cool to look at and see what these guys were doing. Kind of a trip what Steroids can do. You look at this stuff and look back at the Steve Reeves days and earlier Body Builders and it is quite a difference.Not too much to say. It all speaks for itself.Those were good times back then and now were all old. There is another DVD like this one and I noticed that one says ""25 year anniversary edition"". And one does not. But they are the same exact DVD program. I bought two thinking that they were different but they were not. So I gave one to a friend. Just in case you wonder this like I did."
4,Pumping Iron,"Arnold in his prime. His arrogance is a joy to behold. And the others in the movie, what a blast from the past. The hulk - ""I just want to eat my cake"". I use it to pump me up before I go to the gym...."
5,GREAT DVD,This was ground breaking and a great Movie to watch. It is the first an only of it's kind to really show body building for what it is.
5,This is great,Fan of Arnold? BUY THIS MOVIE!!!Fan of bodybuilding? BUY THIS MOVIE!!!Fan of Alpha Males? BUY THIS MOVIE!!!I have to insert more words due to amazons policy
4,Great Video,"The DVD was great.The extras are what make theis worth having.the original movie is dated and you can tell it is old, but heck it's a clasic. The extras are what makes this copy of the movie great all the ""making of"" and extra interviews are great."
5,perfection,this is the perfect movie to have on during a party. nobody gets the crowd moving quite like arnold circa 1972. nobody.
5,Inspiration,"There are other reviews detailing summaries of this incredible documentary and the mind games and raw emotion in the film. I am going to write that anyone who weight trains, a few days a week as a hobby to split training 6 days a week as a job, this movie is a must have. After watching a few minutes of some of the greatest, most well known bodybuilders of the 70's, you will want to literally pull your car out of its parking spot (like Franco Columbu in this movie) and head straight for the gym. On those ""lazy"" days that everyone has, when I don't really ""feel"" like going to the gym or giving it my all, I throw this in and slap the lazy out of myself.This is a great documentary about the sport and the personalities that helped make it. It shows Arnold's charisma and not that he is a dumb ox, or Oak rather. But if I had to sum up how I felt about this movie in one word, it would be Inspiration."
4,Pumping Iron,This DVD is very well done and should be a must for every Bodybuilders aspiring to receive recognition in Bodybuilding circles. Ray Maher
3,alright,Has not shipped yet but Its for my husband who Ill guess will like it since he watches it on internet all the time.
3,Why you can't find it.,I've been told that the reason you can't find this video is that Arnold Schwarzenegger bought the rights and took it off the market because it has a scene with Arnold smoking a joint. Can any of you that have this movie confirm this? I saw it a long time ago and remember it being entertaining but nothing really great.
2,"The original is great, but this version is edited for Arnold","The original VHS version (which I have at home) is a fantastic, very dated, documentary about body-building, starring Arnold right before his big break into movies. However, he bought the rights to the film, so this newly released DVD version was re-edited. Gone is the scene where he smokes pot (he's a republican, after all) and they probably took out some of his nasty comments to other competitors as well, since the original showed him in an unflattering light. Try and see the original. Buying the new DVD only supports his current campaign..."
3,"More-or-less, just a bodybuilding documentary.","Yeah, Arnold can lift weights, and he can teach, but this isn't really a MOVIE, with adventure and plot- it's a weightlifting documentary type film, so ARNOLD FANS and Action fans, don't go out and rent this with a bag of popcorn in hand, because you will be turning on C-SPAN 2 before reaching the end of this film. Pumping Iron is good for studying and learning how to work your muscles. It isn't good for a Friday night flick. PUMPING IRON (1979) Rated: PG 3 1/2 stars out of 5."
3,Governor Ahnold's joint scene,Well worth it just to see the possible future governor of California lean back with marijuana cigarette and a plate of pastries on his lap. This scene will haunt him.
4,Buyin in to it!!!,Love the tape. Really helped with Achilles pain after long distance marathon training. After using the tape for a month I tried a 14 mile rub without it and the soreness was worse. The tape won't get rid of soreness but will greatly reduce it and duration of aches.
2,Won't Stick During Running,"I gave this 2 stars on the hope that if it stays on during my run, it might actually work. It gets a 1 star for sticking. I have tried numerous methods, but alas I can not get this tape to stay on during my run. I have a bad knee that I'm trying to support until after my marathon (then I'll actually get to a doctor). Until then I had been using a knee strap, but it won't let me run past 10 miles. I heard about this tape and thought I'd try it out. By minute 10 it starts to peel off."
3,not bad,"If you watch the youtube videos by trainers on how to tape, they make it look easier than it actually is BUT I play golf and find that it definitely helps........Only problem I find is it doesnt stick to your skin like it sticks to those Olympic atheletes in the pool or in other much more active sports.It comes up at the ends of the tape ...............should stick better that it does for longer time period."
4,sports tape,The blue colored tape is sticking pretty well. The skin shouldn't be touched once the prep solution is applied or the tape comes loose within the first 8 hours of wear.
4,This is the neatest thing since sliced bread!,"This is a Godsend for people who have chronic pain.Besides giving pain relief the tape stays on for days, which is helpful for people who have sensitive skin due to pain. It goes on easy. Taking it off is harder so it is hepful to do it with oil. It makes a bad day better and a moderate terrific!! I have recommended it to my foot doctor and my pain doctor because they are always looking for ways to help their patients get any kind of relief."
3,Works,The Kinesio method works. I had recurrent tendinitis and taping helps tremendously. I just can't get the tape to stay on for more than a few hours. When I first learned to tape 7+ yrs ago the tape stayed for days. Wish it still did.
4,Great Tape,"Recommended by my PT, this tape worked well.I found it relatively easy to apply and it stayed in place and remained effective for a good 48hrs or so. This is longer and more effective than other brands that I have tried.I wish they had a better web site with instructional videos on how best to apply the tape etc, fortunately my PT was able to cover that for me."
4,kinesio tape,Tape is easy to use. Doesn't stick to well to another section of tape. Does the job it was intended for.
5,Amazing product,"This product is truly an amazing, stabilizing product that not only supports the healing process, but prevents against (re) injury as well. Thank you for making it available!"
3,Not for shin splints,"I don't work in health care, but I had heard this tape was amazing. I have very painful shin splints and tried this tape in hopes of even getting a little relief - not the case. Additionally, I have a tape allergy and this tape made huge red blistery itchy patches on my shins after having the tape on for just 36 hours. I would say that this tape is not for use by people who aren't trained properly to use it (as is my case)."
4,Kinesio Tape Walks Softly,"In general, I like this product; however, I get frustrated with how quickly it rolls and comes off. It would defeat the purpose to tape it down with other tape, and yet I find that I have to at least tape down the ends. Otherwise, I like the stability that it gives to my knees, and that it is comfortable while it does so. Ty!"
4,fairly effective,"Most of the tape held on for about a week. Some of it on the back started to come up during the night potential because of perspiration. Many of the ends needed to be tacked down with scrap pieces to be secured throughout the week. However, due to the various strategies we employed to use this tape for pain management therapy, we used nearly the whole roll at a time and most of it stayed right where we put it. We will be repurchasing."
4,Lives up to the reputation. Good,I have been using this product for a few weeks and it has helped with my patellar tendon soreness. So I would recommend it.
1,Kinesio tape,I purchased this tape after visiting a Chiorpractor who used it on my hip area. It didn't do any good when I was going to the Dr. and didn't do any good after I bouth the roll.
2,Not Red...most definitely Hot Pink,"Was disappointed to see that the ""red"" tape that I ordered was Hot Pink. Would have liked to know that. I specifically ordered Red to match my daughters uniform for cheer."
4,Safe for toddlers,"this tape is great, my son who is 2 has low tone, especially his core, so the therapist recommneded Kinesio Tape for his trunk (tape an X across his belly)...it is safe and he is totally fine with it...also easy to use."
3,Not as good as the black tape,"I had previously purchased and used the black kinesio tape and loved it. I thought I would try the beige thinking it would not be so visible while wearing shorts. While it worked the same as a the black tape, and helped me get through a half marathon, I found the beige causes my skin to become inflamed and itchy. I will switch to black."
4,Was skeptical at first...,"I've always gotten shin splints from running; regardless of shoe, surface or speed. I started running again recently after a few years off and after gaining about 25 pounds on a weightlifting regimen. The shin splints were back with a vengeance; I could barely get a mile in (and this at a laughably slow pace)before I had to throw in the towel. After trying all the typical remedies (stretching, proper hydration, starting out slow to warm up the muscles...the combination of which worked worked to an extent), I decided to try the Kinesio tape on a friend's recommendation. I'm not gonna say 'miracle cure', but it certainly helped to a degree I definitely did not expect from what appears to be simple athletic tape with a wavy texture on the adhesive side. I'm no longer limited by my pain tolerance, but conditioning (which is awful at this point, but at least I can complete a 5k without wanting to sever my legs)."
4,It works!,I've been using Kinesio tape for an sprained ankle and it helps tremendously. Same for Achilles tendinitis. Not really for shin splints
4,Tape,The product was received in a good amount of time as well as the product was just as it was described. Thank you
3,does ok!,"It does an ok job, but doesn't stick as well as I thought it would, and definitely not waterproof! It does stretch very well, but sometimes it holds and sometimes it doesn't. I did find if you rub over it again and again, you have a better chance of it sticking."
2,Doesn't stay in place,"I used this tape for an Achilles injury and it did not stay in place. After about 30 minutes into my run it lost its ""stickiness"" and began to come off. I tried it a handful of times after and had the same disappointing results."
2,kinesio Tex tape doesn't stick,"When i received the tape the package was kind of smashed and flattened but the tape itself was not damaged. the tape however, is not sticky like it should be and i wonder if its possible if i got an old roll. Other tape I've used in the past lasts about 5 days and withstands showering without unsticking. this tape falls off 1 or 2 days later."
1,weak tape,I bought this item hoping it would work for my knee ...did not have the sticking strength it needed to hold...
4,Fantastic tape,I have been using this tape for many years. I love to introduce this item to many people who had knee injury or knee surgery like me.Now I am using this tape whenever I feel knee pain as well as when I play tennis. This is such a good way to protect your knee or any other joints in your body.
2,Allergic to Latex?,"I purchase this after a physical therapist taped my knee with a similar product. It doesn't stay on well under slacks or jeans. It starts to roll at the edges. Also, if you are allergic to adhesives or latex, be careful. I got a very bad rash from it and the adhesive is very difficult to remove from your skin. You also need to know the proper way to apply the tape for your particular injury or it doesn't do you any good."
2,Did not work for me,"I bought this product to alleviate some IT Band issues I was having. My physical therapist taught me how to apply the tape and sent me on my way. I have never been able to get this product to stick for more than an hour or so. I have followed the instructions for skin prep, but as soon as I sweat the edges start to come off. This has happened with all 5 attempts I have made at using the tape whether running, cycling, or CrossFit. People swear by this stuff, but it really didn't work for me. I don't sweat any more than the average person, but perhaps I need to the super waterproof type?"
3,Rocktape is WAAAYYY better,"I used this tape on my shoulder and foot. It worked fine when dry, but as soon as I showered this tape came right off. I had put the tape on about an hour before the shower and did no physical activity that would otherwise loosen the tape. RockTape brand lasts and lasts even after multiple showers and working out with it. Thanks Rocktape!"
5,kinesio tex gold,this product is invalueable to me because I had breast cancer and lymph nodes were removed and I now have lympedema which causes my arm and hand to swell. The kinesio tape helps in keeping the swelling down.
3,Kinesio Tex Tape,The tape was as advertised and used per directions received with the package. The tape met our expectations but didn't offer the relief we expected. Very good customer service from the vendor.
2,Not sticky enough,Did not stick for more than one day. I would not reccommend this to anyone if you need for long peroid.
5,Good stuff,This tape is good stuff. Training for a half marathon with this Kinesio tape and published taping patterns doable with an Achilles injury. Couldn't have done it without the tape.
4,Red Tape,"My friend had used other tapes before this tape was recommended by a Physical Therapist, after she had used it on a knee which was receiving treatment. It worked so well --- stayed in place even though it was in an awkward position, where the knee was being bent; it withstood at least one shower -- dried easily afterwards and still kept supporting or ""pulling over"" the knee cap, which had been injured in a fall."
4,Good product,The Tex Tape is a deluxe athletic tape.. curves to the shape of taped area and stretches for flexible support. Its easier to remove than regular tape. It is pricey but worth it for periodic use.
5,A Great Help...,"I have chronic back pain since an injury, and this product has definitely helped me. I'm about 50% better now since using it for about 3 weeks. It's much cheaper than any other treatment and I believe aids your body in healing itself, which is really what it's all about.It is not perfect and you may have some minor itching and or minor irritation, but all in all, it is worth it for sure!I looked at it like : ""Why not - for $ 20 bucks, what do I have to loose?"""
2,It's OK,"I like the kinesio tape, but I'm a little disapointed. It definitely does what it's suppossed to (I can feel it move my knee cap when I put it on)but it comes off too easily and it's definitely not water resistant."
2,Not as good as regular Kinesio tape,"I found this tape lighter weight, less adhesive and not as effective as the regular Kinesio tape. I didn't realize I was getting a different tape when I ordered it."
2,Product did not adhere,This product was applied to my legs properly and I found that when I would sweat while working out it would fall off. This product is to be used with exercise and I was not happy with it.
3,Only for shaved skin.,"I did like this product when used on a runner's knee. It seemed to help but after 30 minutes or more, it always comes off despite all the skin prep I can provide (I am a dermatologist---I do a good bit of skin care!).Shaved skin seems to stick really well, but I don't care to keep my knee shaved in a smiley face pattern, so I can give it 5 stars for shaved skin, three for unshaved skin or at least less hairy areas than a knee on a guy."
1,Does not stay on,"I purchsed this based on the reviews and was very disappointed. I have had my chiropractor provide me with KT on my shoulder several times and it stayed on for days. This stuff falls off overnight, everytime. I have to always use clear medical tape to keep this stuff on at all and even that only works until this stuff completely refuses to sty on the skin. You need a different tape if you want this to stay on for more than 8 hours. Got one star only because it stayed on for a few hours. This is the only 1 star I have ranked an item after providing 30+ reviews on amazon."
1,What a waste,"Note that when they say that this tape is red, it is actually hot pink. It is also 4 times what it costs to buy in a store. Save yourself the effort and frustration, and buy elsewhere."
2,Falls off,"Don't waste your money. Tape does not stay put. Used alcohol, shaved the area to no avail. Tape starts coming off as soon as you develop a mild sweat."
2,works but doesn't stay on long,"Tape is great for little pulls and sprains, however the adhesive is very low quality. I clean the area I stick it to before using the tape. If I'm lucky it might stay on fora few hours. There must be a better brand of this wonderful tape."
1,Has yet to stick,"Maybe my skin just reacts badly to it, but I've tried the tape a few times already and have been unable to get it to stick for more than 20 minutes or so. I even shaved my legs, and applied it following the instructions on the website step-by-step, but as soon as i got out the door for my jog, it started to unravel from the bottom up. By about 1.5 miles (at a 11-minute pace), it was pretty much just flapping around from the top. I'll keep trying, until someone takes it off my hands (or it comes off on its own, since that's the only thing it seems to be good at.)"
4,Kinesio Tex Tape,The same product on the website for much less. Worked great for what we needed it for. Highly recommend it.
1,awful product,Thought i'd try this out as always used Leukotape. Would not purchase again. Did not stick to skin properly and fell off within minutes. Expensive. Leukotape is a much better product that does not unstick and less expensive. A waste of money.
3,Does not resist to water or swetting - Expec to replace patches daily,"Does not resist to water or swetting, star to loose a few hors after applied even not swetting much - Expect to replace patches daily"
5,Therapy,Great tape. It is easy to use and to cut but not very water resistance. If not cut right it will roll up at corners.
5,Got to have more!!,As a therapist this is an excellent modality that I use often. This is the original product that works exceptionally well. Do not except copy cats. I re-order this each time I run out. Great product.
2,Doesn't stay stuck,This tape was highly rated by others but I needed it to tape my foot due to plantar fasciitis. And it did not stay stuck for more than a few hours.
2,tape,The tape came very fast but it did not seem to work for me. The service was fine just the tape did not work
4,Helpful,This is helpful--I use it on my knee. I like the beige color as I feel it is not quite as conspicious as the black tape.
5,EXCELLENT what professional PT's use,"it has the tension needed, it has a wave under stitch which is very important, and it stays on much better than other brands. A trick to make it stay on even longer is make sure you do not put any lotion on the area, and right before clean the area with alcohol pads. Can last over a week this way for most people."
2,Pain: gone. Tape: also gone.,"i just got this yesterday and used it on my knees. a few hours after i showered this morning and padded my knees dry, most of the tape was falling off or in the process of rollling/peeling off of my knees. i didnt even get a run out of them. after reading the reviews, i'm glad that i'm not the only one with this tape curling away from my skin and falling off of me in less than 24 hours. i'm not sure if the beige isn't as strong as the black tape, but i might give the black tape a try. if that doesnt work, then im going with the KT tape instead.with that said, the pain was SIGNIFICANTLY reduced overnight...i was so surprised!"
2,Not the real KT tape,"I was disappointed, I thought I was getting real KT tape, this is an off brand and didn't work for me. It isn't precut, doesn't have rounded corners, and fell off between mile 1 and mile 2. Price was reasonable and shipping was quick, but tape is a knock off and didn't work for me. I need this to last 13 miles or more but it fell off right after I started my run..."
1,Tape doesn't stick,"I bought this tape because I like variety -- colors. In all respects it appears just like the tape my PT uses. However, it doesn't stick. It falls off in water and rolls off in bed sheets. It is truly a waste of money. I found out exactly what type my PT uses and went directly to their website. It also has colors and cute little monkey patterns. AND! It's cheaper too."
2,Kinesio tape,"I'm not happy with the product that I got from amazon. I ordered black kinesio tape and recieved red instead. I wanted black. The only reason I give it a 2 rating instead of a 1, is that I got the tape 4 days before the expected delivery date. I don't know if I will by tape from here again, because I want/need black tape, because it is stronger than the color tape. Can I trust that I will get the correct order the next time I order from here? Thank you."
3,Spartan78,"Looked colorful after application; however, I did not feel any ""healing"" vibes transmitting through the body; in short, do not believe the hype!"
1,poor service from company,"I never received the product after I paid for it so unable to actually review it. But I can review the fact that the company was not willing to compensate me for the loss. I would notrecommend buying through this company, there are other place to obtain Kinesio Tape."
2,Kinesiology tex gold tape,I have been treated by a physical therapist for knee problems. The kensio tex tape he used stayed on for several days. I purchased this and it won't stay on for even 24 hours. I went back and the PT applied my tape. This tape still came off after 24 hours. He said this tape is the same as he uses. So is this roll defective?? I have been cleaning the skin with alcohol before each application.
5,Love it!,Love this tape! It even helped when I had Sciatica and my husband uses on his bad shoulder. Great product.
2,Performance,"I ordered the tape and used it , but the tape only sticks temporarily so you have to keep changing the tape out. So I'm not satisfied at all."
1,Doesn't stick,"Not sure how this tape could possibly have worked for other people, because it doesn't stick for very long. It fell off my skin before I had even run a mile. I had used rubbing alcohol to clean my skin of all oils before putting the tape on and made sure when I applied it I didn't have any flex at the two ends so it would anchor to my skin, and I rubbed it really well to make it stick but it still fell off while running. I tried it a second and third time just to see if maybe it was a fluke, but all 3 times it's fallen off during my run. A friend gave me some Rock Tape and it worked great. Stayed on during run AND through a shower. Will be switching to that brand."
3,maybe a bad roll,I have purchased this tape before and it was fine but this last roll i bought isn't very sticky and keeps coming off
2,Flimsy,"This tape was recommended by my PT but when I got it, it was very flimsy. It seems to be a polyester-Ish material. I used it on my knee for tendinitis and one time after applying it, the piece of tape I had put on vertically tore in two after just 5 minutes of bending my knee. I have had much better luck with KT Tape which is a much more sturdy cotton tape. It feels like it provides a lot more stability as well."
3,Not sticky enough,"Even with clean skin, the tape peels off, sometimes as soon as a few minutes. Maybe it's just a bad roll, but I have switched to a different brand that stays-put longer."
1,All hype...,"I intended to use this for plantar fasciitis when I purchased it. I watched the ""how-to"" videos on applying it. Needless to say, it doesn't work. Well, I honestly cannot say whether it works or not, because it does not stay on long enough to work. If you put it on exactly as the videos say, it still comes off. I have tried EVERYTHING to get it to stay on. Short of wearing an ace wrap over the tape so that friction is not a factor, I have no idea how to get it to stay on. In reading about the tape it sounds like it can be worn 4-5 days with all levels of activity including showering...this is simply not true. Personally, I find it a complete waste of money when using it for the purpose I bought it. Maybe it does work for other places on the body, but for the foot...worthless."
2,Did not work as well as I hoped,"Based on other reviews I thought this would work as well as the tape my chiropractor used - but it sticks for about 24 hours max. When it gets wet it starts to come off, and not even wet from the shower but simply wet from sweat. Won't be purchasing this brand again."
3,Kineesio Tex Tape,A friend recommended the tape for a sore joint. I could not get the tape to stay on my skin...am not sure why but made it very difficult to use and to evaluate if it worked or not...so I was disappointed with the results. Sorry!
4,Good product but KT tape is better,"This kinesio tape is pretty decent, but I'd recommend buying the KT tape([...]) since it comes in pre-cut strips and is very easy to apply. Although for those who want flexible lengths for their tape, they are better off buying this tape and molding it as per need."
5,magic tape,"This tape works wonders! Of course I went to a physical therapist first, who used this tape as part of my therapy when I damaged my knee. She showed me how to put it on - IMPORTANT! Now I use it when I need it. The price was right and the tape is the same as my therapist used. 100% recommend this!!!!! (After seeing your physical therapist!)"
5,"Great Service, FAST, FAST, FAST!",Ordered Kinesiotape on Sunday night and had the package in my mailbox Tues morning! Tape new and was as advertised. Love Kinesiotape and like Bandages Plus for getting it to me so soon.
4,"great product, Great price","This product is the standard for taping is use of pain relief and muscle inhibition. When ordering from works therapy catalogs, or direct website you will pay much more. This website saved me a bundle! Thank you."
3,Okay Product,"I have tried mamy different kinesiology tapes. This product stuck better than some, but not near as well as the best."
5,Amazon Kinesio Tape,After doing a lot of research on the use of this product I ordered some and used it for a month. This is a life saver. Educate yourself about this product and use it. It works!!!!
4,Excellent pain reliever,"It was not so super sticky that it ripped skin, but gave the support and relief that it pormised and it stayed in place for two days! I will continue to use this product."
3,Decent Entry Level Tape,"The product is a great entry level product. It adheres to clean, non-hairy skin, though the edges fray easily. It is a good product for its price, but its durability is limited."
1,"Don't buy this, waste of money","I really regret buying this DVD. I didn't learn anything at all.Maybe for beginner,And if you are a slim and younger person , this instruction won't work for you"
5,Great price for a product I already use,We have been purchasing these gluten free snack bars for several years. Finding them for such a great price was wonderful. Not to mention the free shipping and auto-renewal we signed up for... no complaints so far.Easier and cheaper than going to the store every week or so.
5,Great product,"Read the reviews here with a grain of salt. A couple of people thought these were ""awful"", but I don't. I purchase all three flavors and eat whatever I'm in the mood for, and I enjoy all of them (chocolate, pb, berry). Bottom line, try a box purchased locally, and if you like them, buy them by the case at amazon for their cheaper price. My only complaint is that Amazon grocery doesn't consistently carry the chocolate flavor. If Amazon grocery is to thrive, customers need to know they can find the products they want to buy on a consistent basis."
1,Nearly awful.,"With all the natural, organic ingredients, I can't see how they came up with such a bland, unpalatable product. Not sweet enough, and a bitter aftertaste as well. Maybe it's just me, but I would not recommend this particular flavor to anyone."
1,weird flavor,"These just taste weird. I don't know how to describe it. I knew they wouldn't be like ""regular"" rice krispy bars, but these feel weird with a clear sticky type of glaze & have a very odd rice & peanut butter taste. They also have an aftertaste. My toddler ate half of one, but hasn't asked for one since."
2,Not These:,"Gluten free for sure, And like most gluten free items you dont quite know what to expect for the taste, knowing it wont taste like the regular ""flour"" version. All I can say is that I have a sturdy stomach, and enjoy almost any flavor. But these, well these I dont know what to say. They were bland but had a distinct taste, while not bad I would call it odd. These were not for me, and as many other reviewers have stated, not these. I cancelled my subscription to these and went and grabbed a glass of water."
3,Bob's Red Mill choc chip cookie mix,"Difficult to work with and not the best flavor. The best gluten free choc chip cookie mix I have found is Pamela's, but Amazon does not list it."
2,Not yummy,"My son was very clear. ""Do not buy these again"". Neither of my boys 2 & 7 enjoyed these bars. Our box tasted stale, but I am not sure if that is the normal taste (or not) and I will not buy another box to see. Obviously these are not for everybody even though other reviews give them raves. Now my husband and I will eat them (when we run out of anything better in the snack bowl)."
2,Dissapointed Panda,"I have purchased these before in the stores & always tasted great. Nice Peanut butter flavor..These had a weird taste medicineyand were stale..out of 36 i only had one, Wasnt sure if I would get my $$$ back so I gave them to the homeless.I purchasedother things from the vender that were ok but this was gross!!!!!"

4,Another good read from Janette Oke,"This book seemed to dwell on the issue being presented more than most of her other books, but I have to admit that maybe it took that for the reader to realize how stubborn we ourselves can be! Even if you're unaware of it, there is usually a spot in your life that you Will Not change, even though you know you are being silly, childish or annoying. And for the people who'd identify more with Glenna, well maybe this will give you an insight to someone in your life."
3,Eh...I've read better Oke books.,"""The Bluebird and The Sparrow"" is a book I chose because I had nothing to read at the time, and Janette Oke is my ""go-to"" under such circumstances. The character of Berta was extremely annoying, and she had no growth to her until the last five pages of the book, making it very abrupt and leaving the reader wanting. I found it highly unrealistic for a person to hold such a long grudge against her younger sister, and highly unlikely that no one saw the reason as to why she was the way she was. I think this is one of the poorer made characters of Oke's. Still, it kept me reading, so I ""sorta"" recommend."
1,"Janette Oke, The Bluebird and The Sparrow","I was disappointed in this book by Janette, it is the only one out of nearly all her books that I didn't just love. After reading over half of it, I didn't even finish it. ;(Thanks,Ann"
3,Sweet Story,This was a good story but very sad. While reading this book I wanted to cry the entire time. Not my favorite of Okes books
4,Love the color!,"I've gotten tons of compliments on this bag...The only reason I didn't rate as 5 stars is the quality is much poorer than I expected...For some reason, I was expecting something a bit sturdier, especially for the price. It doesn't seem like it will hold up long term, but so far so good..."
2,An intro for DOS operators who want to do Unix admin.,"Maybe this book should have been titled ""Unix Admin for non-computer users, with some examples for HPUX"" as over half of it introduces general operations like using a Windows based FTP browser. There is little point continuing with this ""review"", as the information content would exceed that of the book. I wouldn't seem so bitter if the book were sold as a beginners guide. Maybe I'll concede that the introduction is thorough in that it starts at the lowest levels and covers most aspects of day-to-day admin but this book does not describe itself as an introduction. <huff>"
2,Good for newbie HP-UX systemadministrators only,"I used this book in an introductory course for HP-UX system administrator's with little or no UNIX experience. It's usable for that kind of course. It's quite an unbalanced and immature book however. Volume manager e.g. is treated extensively while NFS get's only 3 pages. It seems a little bit to me if Mr. Poniatowski is filling the holes in the standard HP manuals. In no way the book fullfill's the cover claim: ""all you need from smarter, more effective HP-UX administration"". As I mentioned before, it's usable for the HP-UX newbie. If you are an experienced Unix administrator (even if it's not HP-UX) you should look somewhere else"
2,good for the beginner,"I initially bought this book on the basis that it would be the 'definative' guide for an experienced HPUX administrator. It is not. It is a good book for a new administrator, but doesn't cover the depth that is required by an experienced HPUXer."
3,You must use it with Hammer's German Grammar,"Actually, this is a workbook that goes along with Hammer's German Grammer and is pretty much useless without it. The exercises and drills presume that you are following along in some book that has explanations of the rule of the grammar you're working on. While the answers are in the back of the book, there are no explanations and no definitions. To go through this workbook without the grammar book would take someone fluent in the language--and they wouldn't need the workbook."
1,"Cassavetes fans, don't bother.","This film, as far as I know, is the ""real"" last film Cassavetes directed -- not LOVE STREAMS, alas, though that makes a much more fitting final movie. Cassavetes was probably trying to generate funding for a film biography of Django Rheinhardt he was preparing to make (which, of course, he never did get to); either that or he was doing a favor for his friend Peter Falk. In any case, the film has NO bearing on Cassavetes other work. You'll see no sign of his touch at any point, and little sign that he particularly cared about the project. It plays through as a mediocre commercial comedy, poorly written and not very funny. It's professionally done -- but that's about it. Don't even be curious."
5,Awesome!,"I have loved this movie since childhood. The music is GREAT. The dancing/exercise is fun. The characters are likeable. This movie is a cool Friday night flick. Don't listen to the haters who claim the movie is a Flashdance rip-off. The only likeness it has with Flashdance is similar music & dancing and/or exercising. The likeness ends there.Anyway, Great movie! Don't miss it!The only con I can see with this movie is it has not been given the rightful duty of being on DVD."
3,HEAVILY CAMPY,"This cheesy but somewhat enjoyable Canadian Flashdance rip-off is Cynthia Dale at her best, physically speaking. She embodies a popular aerobic dance instructor who challenges a competitor in a marathon of the fittest for a chance of owning the loft where stands her health club. Unsurprisingly, the 1984 movie follows every cliché-ridden ingredients to a T, which leaves only the performances of its actors that goes from good (Dale) to bad (everyone else). Cynthia Dale may work her hardest to bring any semblance of humanity to her paper thin character but its her innumerable well-choreographed moves that are really the star of the film. For lovers of bad cinema only.-----Martin Boucher"
1,black specks,"This onion powder when mixed with a small amount of water contains many small black specks that under magnification look like animal waste. None of the other onion powder I have looks like this. I will try to contact the mfgr but meanwhile, will not use or recommend. It could cause disease."
1,Tastes a little like chalk,"I was really not impressed with this. It doesn't have much flavor to it, onion or otherwise. It has a tendency to clump, so if I'm adding it to a soup or something I end up with little onion powder balls throughout. I've never had that problem before. It just doesn't taste right."
2,Stained Glass? Really?,"When I tapped my fingernails on this ""tiffany stained glass"" lamp shade it sounded just like my tupperware bowl..........."
4,The world isn't scattered around us like a jigsaw puzzle,"This is a wonderful thriller; at times surreal, at times resolvable and at times resolved. But there is a great sense of the unknowable in the face of the 'randomness' of events around us. 'What if life is like a soup with all kinds of things floating in it, and from time to time some of them get stuck together by chance to make some kind of whole?' Yes, this is my experience of life and it comforts me that there are unexplainable things - things that I cannot explain and in a real sense can never be explained. The principal character in this novel carries my own name - Gregory - and that bonded me a bit. But it is the statistician, Sciss, who says 'I don't have any illusions. That's pretty awful you know ....' I identify most of all with that statement, if not Sciss himself.Recommended other reading:'Limiting Factor' by Clifford D Simak (this is a short story)'Under Western Eyes' by Joseph Conrad (he comments on illusions too)"
3,Philosophical Mystery Story,"A mystery story involving, of course, dead bodies.The spirit of the novel is best contained in the statistician's remarks on gravity. The word ""Gravity"" doesn't really explain anything, rather it gives a name to the tendency of objects to fall toward the center of the earth. If something like that happens every day, we give it a name of some sort and accept it as normal. If something like that seldom happens, then it's exceptional and warrants investigation.Although I was dissatisfied with the ending, the reasoning employed along the way there is pretty engrossing. The story is also strange enough in places to be bleakly humorous. Maybe an extra half-star, for being different."
5,Not the typical detective tale...,"I feel G.K. Chesterton's ""The Man Who Was Thursday"" would be the appropriate companion piece to read with ""The Investigation"". Both books are filled with the ominious, the unaswerable, both are philosophical and haunting. The mystery here is the mystery of existence. This book is the great sonata of life ""living the questions"". Besides, the atmosphere is rich, dark and foggy - it is the England we all stereotypically imagine in our minds. Read this book because you want great literature. It's not just ""another mystery"". It's beyond that."
4,Excellent guide to the business end of sales automation,"This book provides a good guideline for translating analytical concepts unique to sales automation into language for effective communication to senior management. It is especially useful because it takes a systematic process improvement approach, as opposed to narrowly focusing on implementing a given software package."
1,Sales automation jumping on the CRM bandwagon,"I found this book a waste of time and money. I got the distinct feeling that the author wrote a book about sales automation ROI, and then substituted ""CRM"" for the words ""sales automation"" after the fact. Anyone who actually works in the CRM field for a business will know more than this author does about CRM."
1,Great book if you want to fall asleep!,The author repeats himself over and over and over again. It sure cured my insomnia though.
4,Decent product at a great price,"Sale price couldn't be ignored. I bought 5 sets to replace old round 1980's style lights around the house. Put in CFL's and they look far better already. The tall singular pole with 3 lights is a bit lightweight being made out of aluminum, but I figure i'll have it bolted to concrete blocks so it's not as much of a concern.Build quality is decent. It looks like a cast type mold. no rough edges, finish is quite decent, and the wiring is adequate (not terribly high voltage/thick stuff, but for a regular light, it's far more than adequate. Glass is a bit thin, but again...adequate. For what I paid ($30?) I can't really complain at all, WITH free shipping too.I'd buy from this manufacturer again as it's not the crappy junk from china, but the 'ok' stuff from china."
5,Tamia,"Tamia's first album is one of my all time favorites! My favorite songs on tha album are Show Me Love, Never Gonna Let you Go, and You Put a Move on My Heart. You Put a Move on My Heart is my favorite song on that album. I listen to it everytime I get the chance to. This is a classic that you should add to your CD collection!"
2,If you need a CD that puts you asleep....,"...then maybe try this one. It's good steady soul produced by Quincy Jones but basically pretty boring and unspectacular. Nothing new has been tried and covering ""You put a spell..."" by Mica Paris doesn't really give any surprise either"
5,This Time It Is Love,I loved this CD. Tamia definitely has talent--more than Ashanti. All the songs were songs that you could relate to especially if you have been in love before. This CD is a must have for anyonw's collection.
5,I'm so into Tamia,"This is the greatest album I have ever heard. Many albums you buy you have to skip songs because they are not your taste. Yet with Tamia's CD you will play it straight through.Great songs such as ""RAIN ON ME"", ""I'M SO INTO YOU"", and ""IS THAT YOU"" make this one of the best albums to date. If you enjoy Marvin Gaye and Whitney Houston you will definately enjoy this.This album is a must buy. No other album captures so much feeling and emotion the Tamia's."
4,"Nothing awestriking, but a good debut for Tamia","I bought this album after hearing two of Tamia's songs, ""You put a move on my heart"", a nice ballad, and ""So Into You"", a song with a nice dance beat. This album didn't turn out to be the most amazing debut I've ever heard, but I believe that Tamia has got something started with that promising voice of hers. Oldies' lovers are in for a treat with ""Falling for You""; the remaining tracks, however, didn't impress me."
3,lovely voice with pure and clear vocals,"Has a really pretty voice with a uniqueness that separates her from some of the other young divettes. Good range and tremendous clarity. Needs more ballads like ""You put a move on my Heart"". The ballads on the cd don't really compare to that one and it is the one she'll always be compared to, so she might as well sing up to it."
3,Pretty Good,This is a stictly love song cd. I am still having problems finding the one song i was looking for on her cds. She is still a very good artist.
4,Tamia's voice is like listening to nature itself.,"Tamia's voice is unique and absolutely georgous. On her album, she blends unique ballads with some dancing beats. If you want some good music to listen to and identify with, look no further. You will not be disappointed with Tamia's newest album."
5,Buy It!!,Tamia is being slept on big time! This CD is beautiful and Tamia's voice is uplifting. She definitely did not get the props she deserves.
5,Sheer Class,This album probably deserves five stars purely on the basis of one song - 'You Put a Move on My Heart'. Sheer class.
5,wonderful,Beautiful playing. Wonderful sound. One of the finest musicians around who enthralls you with his passion. A must for the clarinet enthusiast.
4,Works Well,"Not much to say here. It works well, but the wire port connnections are a little difficult to work with. Regardless, I will purchase another one."
4,"Very EASY, good values","The Peach Street Mudders series is very easy, and very encouraging for kids to calm down and keep trying. The reading level is for kids who are ready for a bit more than step readers -- the characters are boys.""Zero's Slider"" has a pitcher who injures his hand and suddenly gains a new pitch -- a slider! Maybe with his new talent, he will be able to interest his uncle in becoming the team's coach. With a lot of practice and encouragement, he becomes a better pitcher.Nice story. No language. Not really interesting for moms, but good reading for kids."
2,Not quite what you might expect.,"The overall impressions of other reviewers seemed to be that the quality of this product was better than the cost would indicate. I have to disagree. The silver beads are of a similar or lower quality than those found in any old bead shop. The ruby beads are very milky and have little character. The feel in the hand is stiff and cheap. Overall, it feels like a $5 piece of junk store jewelry."
5,This book really changed my problem with anger!,"""I understand that anger isn't always wrong and it has a purpose when you use it to bring about positive results. I can seek help from the Lord to control this. I don't have to and shouldn't use suppression as an adequate coping mechanism. It has helped by giving me an improved technique for managing my anger. Using time-outs and prayer has shown me imporovements in my communication with those who anger me. I can be assertive without being angry. It has helped me assert my feelings in a positive way. I am getting imporoved results . .. and am continuing to receive benefit from this book. I am thankful to the authors for helping me."""
5,My Son Loves This!,"Although it says 18 months, my son recieved it for his 1st birthday. He loves it. The only con is that the wheels kick back pretty easily, but he's never unsupervised with it so it's okay.... Great rocker!"
4,Wagner The Practical Musician,"When living in Paris, in desperate financial straits, Wagner turned his hand to salon arrangements for various groupings of popular operas of the day. These include arrangements for string quartet, violin duo, piano and other combinations. The current disc of his arrangements for violin duo of most of the musical numbers of Donizetti's LA FAVORITE is a real winner. There is nothing of the mature Wagner here, but these are first rate arrangements from one of Donizetti's finest musical achievements, and they are superbly played. Although the narration of the plot of the opera is effectively delivered, it probably isn't really all that necessary. The additional time could have better been given over to Wagner's arrangements from Halevy's LA REINE DE CHYPHRE.The recorded sound is excellent, and the Oehms label should be proud of all of the unusual repertoire that they are bringing to disc for the first time."
5,Brilliant Independent Filmmaking,"I was captivated by this film. The true story of a young prostitute trying her hardest to reach for a life of which she can only dream- and then she is murdered. This documentary is truly fascinating. What makes it all the more incredible is that it is all fiction- not in the sense that this never happens, but that this story did. The filmmakers did an outstanding job of making a film that is sharp, different and simply brilliant. There is no room in this film for campy one-liners and staged computer effects- this film is intrepid independent filmmaking- the best type of film you can watch. It draws you in with its feel and dialog. The writing was so good, you think it is all ad-libbed documentary. A whole new way to tell a story.If you do not have this film in your DVD library, you do not like independent film."
4,great acting and a compelling story,I caught this movie at a friend's house. I hadn't ever heard of it and I was a bit shocked by its content. I had absolutely no idea that this was a fictional movie. It seemed so real. The acting is quite amazing. You just get swept up in the story and sucked in to what was going on. There are no bonus materials other than the trailer on the disk and it would have been nice to listen to an audio commentary by the director and some of the actors. It was still a very good movie and not really like anything I've ever seen before.
4,Lots of functionality for the price,"Not only an MP3 player but also a voice recorder and general purpose thumbdrive (USB 1.0).Lacking an intuitive user interface, I had to read the user manual on the included miniCD to learn how to use most of the features. The unit's few controls are used for many functions. The mode control slides left right and downward like clicking a mouse.Slower 1.0 USB speed takes a bit longer to load songs but is still reasonable. The speed is OK as a thumbdrive for transferring a few MB of files. Mostly its intended for files that stay put. But it's convenient to use the same device for music and file transfer.The flat file system seems inconvenient to search for songs but if you just want to play music, the various random play modes are fine for providing a selection of tunes.The sound quality is excellent using the included earphones.So much easier than using my PDA as a music player.It's best feature is the small size. Lightweight enough to hang around your neck all day."
4,Great mp3,"there are only a few minor problems with it. One, there are no files to view the songs in but that is no big deal. The battery life is limited but it will get you through a long car trip easily. Many songs can be downloaded and the quality is very good. This is great if you don't want to spend a lot of money on something that may get beat up or you may loose."
1,DONT BUY IT,this was the worst purchase i've ever made. you cant play music purchased off the i-net and you have to buy a special program to be able to rip music from CDs. i reccommend buying an ipod or spending your $ on video games. DONT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!
3,Pretty but plain,"I bought this journal to replace another one. I loved the fact that it was spiral bound but that a cloth covered it. This journal has many downsides. The reason I like spiral bound is that it's easy to hold the book and write without the other half of the book getting in the way, well the spiral bound part of this book is worthless for me in that you can't fold the book in half. It also very difficult to write in, I need lines to write words nicely, and this book only has lines on the right hand pages, the left hand pages feature a scripture verse and a small picture with no lines and no room to write, so you can only write in half of the book. The lines on the right side are so light you have to look pretty hard to find them sometimes, which stops the easy flow of writing in it's tracks. Overall it's not bad, but I personally wouldn't recommend it."
5,great,"It is a really really really great watch. I have a small wrist but this watch perfectly fits me. It looks very luxurious and over my expected. Besides, $350 is a really great price for a swiss-made tissot. (It is a small watch, so if you are a big boy,it may be small for you;other wise,it is PERFECT)"
4,"You'll feel like you are there, but it takes some effort","I have read 6 books from this series and each one can stand alone and each one describes the environment to the point that you feel you are there. However, these are not the easiest books to read. Janes feels little need to identify who is speaking on every line. He also injects a character's thoughts in with the dialogue. This takes some getting used to as Character A may say something without being identified, followed by B thinking something (unidentified), then maybe B says something, A says something, then A thinks something and after awhile you find yourself starting over trying to figure exactly who said what. I don't say this to dissuade anyone (with reading 6 of these I obviously think these books are worth it) but you should be warned that these might not be your taste."
5,Great writer!,"J. Robert Janes is a very underappreciated author. As you read his novels, you come to appreciate the character development, and above all, the accurate depiction of time and place. Very well worth reading."
2,"Too much ""merde"" and ""Gott in Himmell""","The premise of this book sounded so wonderful that I immediately snapped it up. However, Janes's writing talents--in plot, character, dialogue and sheer command of language--are sadly lacking. The French surete repeats ""merde"" at least 100 times thru the book, with the Gestapo agent keeping up with dozens of ""Gott im Himmel."" Amazingly enough, the sheer repetition of these two exclamations drag down the entire book, defusing all suspense and any plot build-up. As one with an avid interest in prehistory, I found the insipid descriptions of cave paintings, as well as their use thereof in the plot, dampening and dispiriting. The characters of St-Cyr and Kohler (the two main characters of the book) are ill-drawn and flat; the author of the book seems to rely primarily upon the sheer interest of the premise to make his mystery at all interesting."
3,"history, not prehistory","I liked the whole set up for the story--the detectives are relatively engaging and at least one of the characters had my sympathy from the start. But I found the writing awkward at times, and I found myself going back over sentences in search of pronoun references when I would rather have read on to find out if the protagonist got off the roof alive. The sections on cave-paintings (why I got the book in the first place) were disappointing."
4,Good for dancers and lil' kids alike,"Samantha's first hit got me hooked ,and the amazing 'Body II Body' was almost as good.But this , this is amazing. A truely emotional song with a great backing piano & keyboard.The 'Cevin Fisher Vocal Mix' is okay, but it is a bit repetative and I suggest you fast forward to the Dj Disciple Clubmix. For someone who sounds like a character from the Bible this guy really knows where he is going.The Mix is funky , dancy ,and has a pounding house beat to go with it.Buy this song : as well as these remixes there is an Enhanced Video for any 'Die Hard for Samantha Fan'."
5,the start of it all,"Fit for life, and Suzanne Sommers must have read this book at some point in their career. This book seems to be the source for everything written about NH today."
3,Kinesio tap,"The tape seams to be week, I doesn't last as long as other rolls I have had. The tape pills off your skin very easy. It came in an original box that was falling apart. I will say they delivered it very fast."
2,THERE IS A PIECE OF PAPER NOT A REAL CASE,"When you see the picture you think you will have a very hard case good enough for about a year or more. When you get the ""case"" all you have is tape kept in a thing they call case. This is not right."
2,Poor quality,"Having been a user of kinesio tape for several years now, trying several brands, I can say that this particular tape is very poor quality. The good kinesio tape will adhere well for up to a week. This tape starts unsticking within an hour or so."
4,"Real history, not an A&E Biography.",This is the 3rd book I've read from MC Donald. What I love about his writing is his unapologetic bluntness. He writes about the Founding Fathers a politicians and not worshiped as hero's as so many popular historians do. McDonald gets deep into the political issues that divided the Founders into Federalist and Republicans and as a result you see these men not too different then the politicians of today or any era. He does a remarkable job of illustrating Washington's navigation skills through the squalls of our country's first presidency and in only 183 pages.
2,great album..not new,"This album was advertised as brand new and that it came with an enhanched cd of ""the no music of aiffs"". it arrived already opened with no cd to speak of. though there was the cd booklet. which just seems like a tease and rather odd. there is even a large sticker on the top left corner of the sleeve that says it should come with the cd. im happy to finaly own this wonderful album but i wish i could have gotten it new."
3,Cheaper on the ACE web site,This sells for $15 on the ACE web site. You should buy it from ACE and not from any of these Amazon resellers.
2,Bad Marley pick for DVD audio,"This is definitely an early recording that lacks the technical clarity of later recordings. If you like that early Wailers sound, just get it on CD. They should have used a later Bob Marley CD, or created a ""best of"" or anthology to remix in 5.1 surround sound. I would buy something like that in a heart beat. This was a waste of money."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting much more. The sound was sub-par. I got better from my CDs. If anyone wants to buy mine, please let me know. I listened to it once."
5,Awesome Shoe,"I've had this shoe for several years. It's fantastic in the rain and repels water with ease. It's also warm for those cold and rainy days. I use Allan Edmunds shoe polish to further repel rain; although, polishing a Gore-Tex shoe is not mandatory. You can wear these shoes casually or with a suit. That is, versatility is awesome.I rotate shoes daily and use shoe trees - further extending shoe life.To date, this shoe shows minimal wear, is very comfortable and is true-to-size. The shoe does not scuff easily and the leather feels like soft butter after a few times of usage. You can use orthodics and not be concerned with ordering a half size lager as the OEM insert comes out of the shoe easily.My only complaint is that ECCO does not make this model in another color.I highly recommend purchasing this ECCO model - it's a real winner."
4,Excellent cold-weather shoe.,"It does ""breathe"" so it's comfortable for temperatures up to 60F. But higher than that it's too warm. Sole is plastic but durable and lightweight. Down 1 star for rather plain styling."
5,"Low ""Impact carb"" bar - Best tasting of the group","Of the protein bars i have tried on my atkins/diabetic diet, this 'peanut butter delight' and 'peanut butter chocolate chip' by Nitro Tech are the best tasting and most affordable (via GNC) bars availiable.Filling enough to replace breakfast and does not significantly affect my blood sugar."
1,Peanut Butter protein bar,"Personally, I did not like these at all. They were pretty ""stiff"" and didn't have a good peanut buttery taste at all."
3,Technically Okay,Recovering addicts would have rightfully complained if this movie stopped at cliche or stereotype. It does show how addict parents can squeak by at work and home until they hit the meat grinder of recovery. It also shows how a woman and man who begin a torrid romance in N.A. meetings inevitably use drugs again...soon. My big gripe is that they seem too lethargic. Lots of explosive anger and pain emerges after quitting hard drugs that this movie doesn't explore.
2,40 bucks??? You have to be kidding!,My daughter got this gift for her first birthday. The book is cute. But for 40 dollars I expect more. There are only 4 puppets and of those only one actually detaches from the book. I feel bad for my friends that bought it for her. Save your money.
5,Excellent Learning Book,"We received this as a gift when my son was born 27 months ago. It is the best book we ever read. It has puppets to act out the words, it has lift the flaps with letters on them and it has pictures hidding under each letter. My son and now daughter - 8 months love this book. It is soft and extremely duriable. I highly recommend this adorable book. Have fun with your kids!"
1,missing parts,We received this but its missing ALL kinds of parts. There is no way to contact the company and my only course of action seems to return it. Sad for the hassle but no communication is a bad deal.
4,no problems,Don't know why people are having a problem with the chuck. I am not experiencing any issues. I've been using it with Craftsman Speedlock drill bits and it seems to secure them just fine. I am not involved in construction just using it when a drill is required. The plastic bit holder that secures to it is pretty much useless. The light that comes with it is a bit of a joke. It is only good to be used as a stationary light..way too heavy to use as a flashlight.
5,Well Worth The Money,"I am a custom builder, I have been using this drill/driver for 7 years now. I own 6 of them including the original in the 3 different configurations over the years. As stated I do custom work to last a life time, I use little nails, mainly screws. I have driven thousands of screws (including 4"") with this drill.....NOT ONE PROBLEM. Yes, I had one problem when the original got caught on a ladder and damaged the trigger switch, $12.64 later it was as good as new.Lots of torque and light weight the perfect package......GET THIS ONE!!!"
4,12 Volt Cordless Drill,Purchased this cordless drill for small jobs around the condo. I am pleased with the quality of this product.
5,Comfortable to use and great value,"I needed a cordless power screwdriver to work in tandem with my heavy duty DeWalt cordless drill. I was willing to pay for just the drill, battery and charger... and then I triple-checked the description that included a second battery and flashlight for the same price. Turns out the flashlight is very handy, well designed and extremely bright. More importantly, the drill/driver is a pleasure just to hold. It's comparatively light weight, and the handle shape and rubbery material that goes against the heel of my hand makes it a pleasure to use."
5,great lightweight cordless drill,"My brother does some construction work and recommended this when I asked for some recommendations on a good cordless drill that wasn't too expensive. It has great balance, is lightweight, easy to switch drill bits, and has power level settings. Basically, a great drill. The flashlight is pretty powerful as well."
3,decent drill,"this has been a decent drill, however im really really disappointed in the battery life. after about a year and a half of everyday use BOTH batteries are shot. i had a 30 dollar craftsman that out did this drill in power and battery life. not worth the price tag. now in order to get a new battery i might as well buy the whole kit again, as the batteries cost more than half the cost of this kit."
4,Solid Backup Drill,"I purchased the Hitachi 12Volt drill after my Dewalt 9.6V bit the dust. The latter was old, awkward and had a broken chuck collar so I was happy to see it go. The Hitachi is light and has reasonable toque. It is well balanced and stable standing on its battery pack. I use it in tandem with my Panasonic 12V, probably the best rechargeable drill I've ever purchased. The Hitachi gets the basics done and I have no complaints after 1 month of use."
5,This is an excellent drill for the price.,Very impressed with the quality of this drill. Plenty strong for homeowner use. Great drill for smaller finish projects. Probably would not be the primary drill I would own if I were still in the contrcting business but definately one that I would have on hand.
2,very poor battery life,"At first I really liked the light weight of this drill and it seemed to have adequite power .After I left the drill for two days and tried to use it ...the battery was dead ..I used the second battery that was fully charged ..same thing ,when I tried to use it ,battery dead ..I returned this drill ,traded for a Porter Cable 18 volt for the same money ..so far so good ..."
3,The chuck is a serious flaw,"This is not a bad drill, and although I thought the light was sort of useless, it turns out to come in quite handy on many occasions. The chuck however, is a problem. It's difficult to get it tight on a drill bit, partly because the ring nearest the drill is hard to grip, but there also seems to be some issue with the design of the threads inside, or something. I finally replaced the chuck; see my other reviews."
4,This is a gold box deal I say go for it.,I spent 18 years selling power tools. I spent nine with the largest manufacture. And this is a good deal. Jump on it! I might myself. But not sure I need it since I have three cordless drills by a company that starts with a B and ends in a H and has OSC in the middle.
3,"good for 'round-the-house, not for heavy duty","Very honest gentleman at the store recommended this drill and i got it thinking i'd use it around the house. drilled a couple holes here and there but when i took it to a job site it couldn't stand up to the ryobi or the dewalt out there. after only about 20 deck screws it started smoking a little from the vents near the back.maybe it was because it was still really new, and others on here have said theirs had plenty of torque, but this guy didn't do it for me (especially on the high speed/low torque position) and the high speed could be higher as well.so again, around the house is probably fine. very light weight, quick charge."
1,Charger problem,I baught this remembering how hitachi mades such good drills before. I really loved them. 1 month after I baught it the charger went bad.. 1 year warranty... LOL. Ya if you can get hold of the people or try to get a return call I would be amazed. Waranty is worthless without someone to take it.. By Something else with a trustworthy company.
2,Not Impressed,"I purchased this combo set about 9 months ago. It still looks good but I think its about done.The motors much slower, I can't make it through the day on either battery. And I'm maybe using it for 15 mins. Its alright going into drywall but forget using it more then for 3 or 4 11/2"" deck screws. I do like wieght and the flashlight will last for about a half hour."
3,Great Drill - good luck with the batteries,"I purchased one of these sets from Lowes after Hurricane Katrina... The batteries lasted about two years of medium use... Have been milking them ever since. Fortunately I am a home owner and not a construction person.. I also purchased a cheap AC powered drill. Whenever I need portability, I know I will have to recharge the batteries and hope I get an hours use out of the pair... There has to be a better way... And the batteries are expensive, if you can find them."
3,decent drill for the price but would not buy again,"I purchased this drill about 2 years ago so I can give a long term review. I am a woodworking hobbiest and do-it-yourselfer and have given this drill moderate use. One of the batteries started not holding a proper charge after about a year, I thought this was rather short battery life. The second battery is still going strong. The drill is not overly heavy and does have plenty of power and the battery lasts a fairly long time between charges. My major complaint, other than the one battery going bad, is the chuck. It is difficult to tighten enough so that the bit will not slip. I have several other drills and they seem to have much better chucks. As I said, this drill is not bad for a budget price but the next one I buy will be with lithium ion batteries and a higher quality drill."
3,Hitachi drill chuck,I agree with the person that has had chuck problems. This drill is a nice all around drill for average every day tasks but the chuck is extremely annoying. I am constantly trying to tighten the chuck and it still falls out on occasion. If it wasn't for this weak spot the drill would be a five star product.
2,Dangerous,"I work on Microwave Stations. I take care of my tools exceptionally well; I don't drop them, mistreat them or abuse them. A spare can quite often be 1200 feet below and the effort needed to achieve work position necessitates the minimum load during tower acsention. The problem with Hitachi drill is the way the battery is locked in the place. Two very small tabs along side the batteries break very easy during insertion. The broken tabs allow the battery to fall loose from the tool endangering anyone or anything beneath the work area, be it 3 feet or 1200 feet. Anything impacted by the falling battery is subject to injury or damage. The tool works very well and is comfortable but be cautious."
2,Loog Looking Item!,"Yes, it's a nice item and they do give you a good value for the money...However, Not enough torque for hardly any project even though it's 12volts!!! It really acts as a 7volt unit!"
3,Stay away from seller,Sold me power drill that died after 2 light uses. Stay away from Reconditioned Sales! BAD SUPPLIER!
5,Great drill,"The drill works great, batteries last a reasonable time. The clip on the drill to hook on a pocket is very handy. The carry case and flashlight could have been left out to save a dollar. I am very happy with this."
5,Hitachi DS12DVF3 cordless drill/driver kit,"I am very pleased with this kit. The smaller size of the drill is particularly handy and yet is has plenty of power for the jobs I have used it for. The light was very useful during a recent power failure. Overall, well worth the price."
4,Its a Boy!,This order process and shipping was very prompt and satisfactory. The product came in perfect shape usps. Haven't actually tried the product yet but ordered for my daughters birth and it was excellent two years ago. Definately recommend
5,Excellent recordings from an excellent pianist,"Idil Biret, a student of Alfred Cortot, Wilhelm Kempff, Nadia Boulanger etc., gives dazzling, magnificient Chopin recordings. She with her many awards, does not only deserve to be a well known pianist, but also one of the few artists, who truely give new breaths to those classical masterpieces. These recordings are very good, if you think that Biret is considered to be one of the outleading Chopin artists of the century. You can find energy, sense of humour, dynamism, personality and creativity in her playing. She certainly bewilders the audience, who for the first time listens to her. I would advise you to collect many of her recordings, and even listen to her in a recital. You will agree on what I say."
2,Avoid Biret's Chopin,"Her recordings of Chopin are nightmares, avoid them. In my early days I bought several of these because of their budget price. Don't do it! Try players like Rubinstein, Zimmerman, Kissin Ashkenazy or Argerich. These are some real Chopin performers."
5,Neurosurgeons...the matadors of the medical profession,"...as both a writer and a neurosurgeon. First of all let me say that this book is a thumping good read; one of those rare writings that grab you and takes you on that cerebro-emotional rollercoaster ride that is usually characteristic of non-fiction thrillers. A quarter of the way in you forget this book in true personal account of a neurosurgeon and as the narrative enters bestseller territory, the writers jars you back to reality with brilliant segues between"
5,"Finally, a chance to get a grip!","This book is a great tutorial for anyone, but is especially wonderful for women. Ms. Hayden helps examine the money lessons and money attitudes women have grown up with so that taking control of finances comes from the inside and is about more than just money. She then makes the money very basic and understandable and puts the work easily into your hands. This book gives terrific no-nonsense lessons with a lot of support and compassion."
5,Awesome reference on an exceptional airplane!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone remotely interested in airplanes. Mr. Pearcy delivers the goods on an American built airliner that has become a global workhorse. Lots of outstanding photography and good information, this is a must have for every aviation library."
3,"Excellent book, marred by poor quality control.","I've been reading this series since 1998, and love it. Having it available in eBook format is a fantastic plus; I'm on limited space, and need to cut back on the physical volumes.Unfortunately, this Kindle edition - unlike the physically printed ""dead tree"" edition - is marred by myriad typos and formatting errors. Some of them are minor (using the wrong apostrophe for abbreviations; hyphenation marks where they don't belong); some are more significant (spelling mistakes, probably from OCR errors that weren't caught on a proof-read; poor text flow - missing paragraph breaks and similar.)The book itself - indeed, the entire series - is a fantastic read, and well worth the asking price. Sadly, the eBook edition needs more polish before it can be called a properly finished product. The same applies to the other three books in the Westlands cycle of the overall series (I haven't yet bought the other 11 books for my Kindle.)"
5,Good for the Whole Family,This CD provides exactly what it says: an opportunity to relax deeply. Both young and old in our household enjoy the calm language and voice of Steve Wolf. I strongly recommend Relax Deeply!
1,This toy is only 1 inch long . . . wish I knew that,"As one who is new to shopping for trains, I think it would be good for a seller to clearly mark the gauge of the product they are selling. This is a tiny HO Scale item, but nowhere does the seller say that. The ""Product Dimensions"" are listed at 3 x 2 x 5 inches, but the actual item is 1 inch long. I had recently bought a few Bachmann ""G"" Gauge trains for my father, and wrongly assumed this would go with that set. I am aware that my inexperience in this train realm plays a part, but it seems like it would save folks some disappointment if they had a clear understanding of what they were buying."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I HAVE PURCHASED 2 OF THESE. THEY ARE VERY SMALL AND I COULD NOT GET THEM TO RUN ON MY HO SCALE TRACK. THEY ARE SO SMALL, THAT I THINK THAT THEY DO NOT WEIGH ENOUGH TO MAKE PROPER CONTACT WITH THE TRACK. THIS CHRISTMAS GANDY DANCER ONLY MEASURES 1 AND 1/4 INCHES IN LENGTH. IT WEIGHS 1 AND 1/8 OUNCES."
3,Product dimensions are not what's listed.,"Very cute; however size listed is incorrect. The correct product size should be shown as 1.25"" long x 1"" wide x 1.25"" tall. The elf did not do the pump up and down action like santa. Again very cute; however very small on the train tracks compared to an HO scale train."
3,Keep it clean,"It's a cute little thing and runs great....until the mechanism starts to collect dust and hair. Keeping it clean is difficult because it's so small. Still, I think it's a nice addition to my Christmas train set."
1,Nortel Networks Router Configuration,"This book should be titled how to use Nortels Site Manager. No help with the Bay Command Console (bcc), or how to deal with Nortel's command line interface's."
1,A really cheap shot,"The cover on this edition is a really cheap shot by the publisher or authors! It is nothing more than slander -- a malicious, false and injurious statement against the late General Douglas MacArthur! Bah!"
4,Is All Money Good Money?,"Best friends Pat and Rafael meet Shabazz at a rally in Harlem and the three become fast friends. With their distinct personalities, they balance each other. Rafael, or Rafi, is a pretty boy and ladies' man. Pat, a thinker, is quiet and very smart. Shabazz, the unspoken leader of the trio, has an intense ambition to succeed and is preoccupied with money. A chance encounter places them smack dab in the middle of hustling. With big plans for the future and determined to make a difference, it's decided that hustling will be left to Rafi and Shabazz while Pat furthers his education in the legal and political fields. With the newfound money, power and respect, will things go as planned? Can blood money become clean even with the best intentions?Paul Johnson has an entertaining tale to tell, and he doesn't disappoint. Johnson's story moves beyond the basic drug dealer's rise and fall formula. BLOOD MONEY is worth the read.A Lovely Murder Down South"
5,Good Book,"The book was used, but it was in very good condition and the cost was very reasonable. I find Long to be a very good writer. I received the book vety shortly after I ordered it."
2,Poor Sound Quality,The title of my review says it all. The audio quality is poor for a 1960's recording. There are so many great Zoot Sims recordings that should be purchased before even considering this one.
1,Kind of creepy,"The script for this video is actually kind of clever. The characters are using Mother Goose rhymes and other poems to carry on a conversation. The problem is that they're adults acting like children and that is very CREEPY to me. It would have been better if kids played the kids and recited the rhymes. As is, it's no good."
1,Didn't work for me,"I don't feel that I'm that creative of a person, so I thought this book would be helpful. I didn't find it full of suggestions for games; a better title might be ""what to do with your life each month."" The book had sections recommending that I buy a new outfit, tweeze my brows or other suggestions for mothers (inspirational, but not what I bought the book for). It also recommends chocolate pudding, peanut butter and other allergy/choking hazards for games with 6-9 month olds. IMHO the book wasn't helpful: it wasn't aimed at games, it was an oddly written ""what to expect the first year."""
5,Good Stuff!,"The first time I gave this to our yeasty dog, areas of skin that were already red and yeasty became redder. By the second day, new areas that never had broken out before started to break out. I kept on it though b/c I knew it was working if it was making him worse before it made him better. He has been on it for a month and his back thigh is cleared up, his groin is cleared and not irritating, but still a faint red, and his chest and front leg are a lot less red and he isn't licking at it anymore. His hot spot healed up too. Im hoping it heals it all completely and I think it will, but just takes time. Its definitely purging the yeast out of his body. I would recommend this product to someone else!"
5,Great quiet fan!,"I got 2 of these for the front of myAntec Nine Hundred Steel ATX Ultimate Gamer PC Case (Black)to replace the noisy 3-speed stock fans. My PC is now about half as loud! Pulls a lot of air without spinning really fast, and my motherboard now controls the fan speed.No cons really."
2,Starter Kit,"The memory card doesn't work, and the ""Z"" button on the controller dosn't work....haven't tried the extension cord yet."
4,BattleTech: The Periphery,"The Periphery (Battletech)The Periphery (sourcbook) is a nice addition for source material. If you are interested in the backstory of the BattleTech universe, especially about House Amaris and the other major Periphery realms, this book is full of interesting tidbits. Be warned, though the history is presented as short stories and personal accounts, the editing is somewhat suspect. Names and dates between books are prone to typos. Even separate sections possess typos, calling into question the validity of some of the information. Also, the latest source material in the book is only current with the ""in universe"" publication date for the book, 3025.All things considered, The Periphery (sourcebook) is a worthwhile purchase for the devoted BattleTech gamer."
3,One drawback. . .,"This fan provides a powerful wind but it doesn't open. Whenever I get a fan, I check it over to make sure that it can be taken apart to be cleaned. This fan doesn't open and so while I am able to vacuum the heavy dirt and dust buildup from the grate, I cannot reach the blades which are (after much use) thickly coated with dirt and crud. If you cannot clean off the blades, any fan eventually becomes sub-effective and the heavy dirt will wear out the motor by having to make it work harder, giving it a shorter life-span. The only way you may be able to clean it is to have a special vacuuming tool or brush that will fit into the grate (which is made up of very narrow spaces)."
1,No admittance,Cruddy eastern-ish hippie acoustics does not benefit in the slightest from lo-fi production and puny vocals.
4,Just as expected,"They are strings, for goodness sake. Some players will love 'em and some won't. You gotta try 'em before you'll know if they fit your style of playing. For me, they are fine."
4,I thought they would be better,"I read a lot of positive reviews on the 9.5s and after some use, I am kind of disappointed.CONSTRUCTION:They are just like any other strings, just lighter gaugePACKAGING:It arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionPRICE:At $4.99 new with free 2 day shipping, this is a no brainer.CONCLUSION:I initially liked the feel of these strings, but the more I played the more I realized that it didnt have the tone I was looking for. I am used to 10s and 11s and though they are more difficult to bend with, they sound much fuller. I put these on my latest stratocaster build and have since replaced them with 10s."
5,Excellent,"These were a great value, bought them for my son. He could not have been happier. Service was great and I received them well before the time I expected. We will definitly order from here again."
1,Couldnt finish,"I am a future war and apocalyptic novel junkie. This is my first review ever after reading dozens of books in the genre. But I felt compelled because this is also the first book I could not finish. I believe the author is knowledgeable about politics and culture, but he attempts to convey too much of that knowledge to a fault. The long winded monologuing and posturing by normally reticent figures such as the Japanese Emperor made it quite painful to get to the next chapter. Perhaps the story gets better as the book progresses, but I just don't want to have to work that hard for the payoff."
5,What can I say? NICE!,"After a LOT of research, I chose to purchase the Aircat 6255 angle grinder. As an RV service tech, I use an angle grinder at least 3 times a week, on a wide variety materials. This grinder has yet to disappoint! Lots of power, SUPER quiet, ergonomic, and super lightweight! It's the envy of all the other techs in my shop. Has all the power of a Snap-On or Mac, at 1/3 the price! Just sometimes wish it had a trigger safety, but..."
5,Aircat 90* angle diegrinder,"Very quiet compared to my other diegrinder, has good power, and is efficient in the amount of air it uses making it a better canidate for someone who has a smaller compressor than cheap grinders. I like quiet air tools and can use this without earplugs no problem. Highly recommend this and the other aircat tools I own such as 1/2"" & 3/8"" nitrocat impacts, 1/4"" & 3/8"" ratchets."
2,Dead Can Disappoint,"Where ""The Mirror Pool"" had its gorgeous moments, it also hinted at the embarassing excess that Gerrard was capable of when left to her own devices. Strangely, Duality seems in need of a bit of that excess. Episodic and sketchy, it all seems a bit soulless. A letdown for longtime fans."
2,going through the motions with Lisa and Pieter,"(this review focuses on Lisa's vocals, b/c Pieter's contribution does nothing for me.) What a disappointment! Geez, where's the rapture, the ecstatic quality of Lisa Gerrard? I once thought I could listen to her reciting the phonebook and love it, now, well, I'd welcome the phonebook! While it blows away some of MIRROR POOL's cobwebs, this collection, well, if it had been billed as incidental music for some film, I might be more forgiving, but, an actual album? Sorry, I miss the hair-standing-on-the-back-of-my-neck feeling that I find in older Dead Can Dance. The only point where this approaches that, for me, is in parts of ""The Human Game"", but, not much... I've heard the last track derided as a soundtrack for a pineapple commercial, I'd have to agree... For someone looking for a painless intro to a great voice, buy it, otherwise, dig back into the DCD catalog..."
2,No!... Not Disappointment!!,"I must say that after being a fan of Dead Can Dance for years now, and hearing that Lisa was out making music for movies, and sharing her beautiful talents with the world I was looking forward to buying one of her solo albums.But I'm so disappointed! Maybe two or three songs on the whole cd compel me to emotions that evoke sadness or happiness. The rest are just ""blah"".I know that it is not the same band, I know that she is a talented woman, I am just not impressed with the level of creativity on this album.If you are looking for a moving album, something that is full of life... this is not the one."
1,Sleep music??,"It was okay. It lacked the much wanted ""middle eastern"" new beat. I found that it was dragging and way too slow. Not up to what I was looking for. I like that new disconcerting rhythmic beat which is classic to middle eastern's new beat fused with hip hop of sorts. If it was more up to date I might want it."
4,Better than Mirror Pool,"Do you like Dead Can Dance? What about soundtracks such as 'Gladiator', 'Heat', 'The Insider'? You'll probably like this. I liked it better than her previous 'Mirror Pool'."
3,move was okay,"I was expecting more gold than what was shown,It's old time western. Acting was okayNot sure what year it took place in."
4,Listen to the Last Day,"Just caught ""The Last Day"" by Marilyn Scott on the local radio and intend on buying the CD. ""The Last Day"" is a touching, thought-provoking song that nearly brought tears to my eyes. It asks what would you do if this were your last day on earth - and why would you have to only think of these things if it WAS only your last day on earth. In checking out some of her other cuts from the CD, I think this might be someone to slip onto the CD player, grab a glass of Chardonnay, lean back and enjoy."
4,Smooth Vocals; Relaxing Grooves.,"Marilyn Scott has garnered mainstream attention with this album. Adult Contemporary radio stations gave light airplay to her first single ""Starting to Fall,"" a soulful and mildly-upbeat track that showcases Marilyn's effortless vocal style. She can turn a phrase with such beauty and communicated enjoyment that the listener is drawn into a world of warm-blanket, soft-lighting and cup-of-coffee. Her second single, ""The Last Day,"" a more traditional radio ballad, is generating more interest on A/C radio because of the touching melody and spiritual-minded lyric. Overall, a good listen-in-the-background album of smooth jazz with strong pop elements. Her voice is the focus."
2,Wanted to like this,"I love working out at home and I do workout videos most days of the week. I consider myself reasonably accustomed to following the cues of the people leading the workout and can follow along with pretty much anyone... except Karen Voight. This is unfortunate to me, because I can tell that it would be a great workout if the cues were more specific and the moves easier to follow. The steps change too often and without adequate warning, it goes unnecessarily in too many directions, and it's so dark you can hardly see what they're doing. I really like the general feel of the video and the intensity is great. If you're patient enough, you could try doing this one a few times and learning the routine to where you don't have to rely on cues. If you did, I'm sure you'd get a very nice workout. I just personally get too frustrated when I try."
4,"Dated looking, but still a good workout","Close your eyes to the dated 90s set and workout clothes, deafen your ears a little to the dated music, and you've got yourself a pretty good workout.The choreography is fairly complex - definitely not for anyone with two left feet - but I found that I picked it up after doing this workout four or five times. But Karen definitely gets my heartrate up during the cardio section - she often utilises large (but controlled) arm movements to increase the intensity.The strength training section is effective and thorough - I struggle a bit with form during her ""skiing"" moves, but otherwise it's a good solid workout.Not as inspiring or fun as some of her others, but definitely one I enjoy sweating to."
4,karen voight great no nonsense instructor,"she's a highly regarded and award winning fitness instructor. she's not all smiley and excited, instead she's very down to business. the only thing which got on my nerves was the overkill on production values--too MTV styling. makes it confusing sometimes to follow her when the camera is all over the place. a great intermediate workout. for a good beginniner's one (with good production values) try her workout with elle macpherson, your personal best filmed in Hawaii."
5,Beautiful and farcical at the same time,"Beerbohm was a great caricaturist, both in words and illustration, but Zuleika was, sadly, his only novel.The first time you read it you will weep with laughter at the farcical hilarity of the situations that Beerbohm conjures up and the way that he describes them.The second time you read it, you will weep be entranced by the beauty of the prose.The third time you read it, you will realise that you have acquired a true friend in the book, which will live with you forever.I have purchased countless copies of the book because I keep giving or lending copies to people ... and this is a book that once lent, never returns."
2,Fairly decent.,"I thought that this was an well written book, and I laughed with this novel some. But in the end I did not think too highly of it. I just do not care for a satire on England and Oxford University."
3,Average at best,"I was very disappointed by Zuleika Dobson. I found parts of the book a struggle to read and finished the book feeling less than satisfied. While I thought it was a good book overall, I certainly wouldn't rank it in the top 100 books of the century."
1,The Golden Hits of the '50s & '60s Live,"When I buy any DVD, I want to have an idea of what I,m getting. If the tracks are not available I don,t buy & even if the tracks are available I must have the full song. Most of us I dare say have a few songs from certain singers/groups that we look forward to and may end up an alternative song but that's OK as we are collectors. I'm 63 yrs young and look for oldies around the '60s. This DVD does not give me a clue of what is in it. B&W? No indication."
5,Another T.J. Lubinsky Success!,"As in his other productions, T.J. continues to revive excellent individuals and groups from the past. In the case of The Four Freshmen, eventhough not the original group or at least one original member, the group provided an excellent sound and harmony! For his age and condition, Frankie Laine did an outstanding job. As with T.J.'s other endeavors, this production is well worth the money spent! Thanks for making it available at a reasonable price!"
1,not good,"it stopped, repeated, stopped, etc. It was no good to me. However I did not return it. I only heard the first few songs."
3,Give Us At Least A One Classic HIT! At Least ONE!!,Not the first classic hit..I dont know why he calls them The Smashing Pumpkins if he isnt doing any of their hits. They could at least do a few in a encore performance at the end of the show! Give us Bullet With Butterfly Wings! or 1979 or something that we remember from your heyday!the new songs are good too but I wanted a concert with the classics too!
1,if all goes wrong,"the title says it all. been a fan since 1990 so i was looking forward to this but after seeing the""concert"" part i wonder if this so called producer had a clue what a concert doc. really is!!!!! this just sucks!!!"
1,wheres the songs that made them great?,"very lame concert, nothing from there catalog that made them what they aretoday. very disappointing, if all goes wrong, is the perfect title, i love the PUMPKINS, but this is a dvd i will be ""SMASHING"".more acoustic than electric, too many new weak tracks.felt sorry for the crowd, they looked bored and confused many times during the concert, my review will probably upset many fans,for which im sorry, but i refuse to kiss corgans behind, like many already have on this dvd. the track list just plain sucks!wont waste my time on the documentary, like i did driving to the store to buy this...."
1,Do you need this for any Hitachi Machine other than a chain saw?,"I ordered this when I ordered a Hitachi Miter Saw. This oil is for Chain Saws. I think that it should say that in the description. I was going to return it, but it is not worth the cost."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"NOT WHAT YOU WANT IN A TROUBLESHOOTING BOOK AT ALL. VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF EXPLANATION. HARDLY ANY GOOD SYSTEM ANALYSIS. ASKS YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, THAT PROBABLY ISN'T THAT WHY YOU BOUGHT THE BOOK. IT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU FIGURE IT OUT. SAVE YOUR MONEY KEEP LOOKING AROUND. THIS COPY IS COMING BACK."
3,Not a serious troubleshooting guide,"This is a decent book if you are looking for a brief, general survey of HVAC troubleshooting. The format is concise and well organized, however it is definitely lacking in details and complete, accurate explanations. It would be much better if there were solutions to at least some of the troubleshooting problems."
3,Good book but lacking key details,"This is a good book that covers the basics for trouble shooting. But if you are looking for answers to the trouble shooting questions in the book to double check yours, look somewhere else because they are not in the book. That being said you will never know if you were right or not, there is not even a teachers guide to the book for answers"
4,Great book from a Pro.,"I have just finished taking my Reflexology course and my instructor was taught by Eunice Ingham. I read it completely but I know I will be referring to it for many years to get that extra information I need. It is a great book to tell you where to work the foot for certain ailments. Easy to read, it may be a bit difficult for those who have not taken a course. It is an excellent book though to show the results of Reflexology are certainly there."
4,the best of the best...,"If you're interested in the marine corps, and especially the silent drill team, I would recomend this video..."
5,a terrific cookbook as well as a fun read,"Danford has captured the essence of noodles in a wonderful new cookbook with terrific personal anecdotes, as well as insightful thoughts. She has created some delicious recipes, which are easy to read and easy to make. Great instructions from a truly inspirational cook and author."
2,Tom Jones Whats New Pussycat DVD,"This is nice to have along with previous releases but why are the three shows featured only partial.There is plenty of room on the disc to include the full uncut episodes. Even allowing for licensing issues with certain guest artists,there is no excuse for excluding half of Tom's performances (whilst including guest slots with no involvement from Tom)."
2,"It's an ordinary show, it could be better.","This DVD does not have the best songs of his selections.There are better shows than this one. He sings very good but, it's not worth it to buy it."
2,Just A Tease,I don't get it. What's the point of putting out snippets when you can produce the whole series? This volume clocks in at less than 77 minutes. Can you do us a favor and just put out a collection of TJ's performances from the series???? Chronologically if possible??? The random dribs and drabs are infuriating. Love the man. Love the performances. Hate the compilation choices.
3,Back in the day,With today's vocal synthesized phony vocalists it is good to know that captured on film is Tom Jones. A man that could take all the manufactured singers of today out behind the barn for a butt whoopin on how to sing.There are historic magic moments caught on this DVD that will sadly never be again and if anyone can listen to the heartfelt power of Tom's voice and not be impressed then you are deaf and need a heart transplant.
5,Bravo!,Naxos has done it again! Great CD! The musicians play Mozart beautifully and a fine job was done on the recording. Great price for great music. You won't be sorry you if you buy this CD.
4,Excellent reference for Asian e-Gov programs,"I'm very glad I came across this book. I believe it's the first one that covers e-Gov programs in Asia so comprehensively. Most eGov books I've read focus on initiatives in North America and Europe. As the author Yong points out ""Asian nations have their unique needs for eGov"". Being an IT consultant working in several countries across Asia, I totally agree with him. This will be a handy reference for me."
5,Great reference on ICT applns in Asian governments,"An enlightening selection of case studies from Asian countries. Well put together, and very readible. Some hard to find material from countries like Brunei and Taiwan. First-hand views by government officials especially useful."
5,Look beyond the obvious,"Timothy Leary's name gets dropped with more frequency than the LSD he seems to be inextricably associated with. Ignore such name-dropping. Go to the source. Read what the man was trying to accomplish, in his own words.Drug War proponents who saw Leary as an anti-Christ of sorts, and stoners who invoke his name and the phrase ""turn on, tune in, drop out"" as reason to do nothing with their lives but drugs, BOTH missed the point. Go to the source. Get the facts. And have fun doing it -- Leary's an enjoyable storyteller."
2,Not as good as they used to be.,"I have been buying the Shooters Bible now for over 20 years.They seem to be getting worse each year. It is inaccurate in some places and wrong in others.The Gun Digest has better coverage as far as models go, the ""Bible leaves out many makes and models.They really need to hire a ""gun"" person to review this book before it is released.Examples of problems:1. Page 334 the Enforcer does not have a 4.8"" barrel.2. Page 331, New Model Super Single-Six???? Looks a lot like a Vaquero3. What happened to Armalite/Bushmaster Rifles? Still in business, but not in the ""Bible"".4. Numerous Ruger models missing.This may be my last year for this dissappointment.Some of the articles are good, but I would wait until it goes on sale before I would spend the money."
2,Disappointing Bible,"The latest Shooter's Bible was for me a big disappointment. My overall impression was of its being a fairly slipshod production. A number of firearms that have been introduced within a year or so of publication are nowhere to be found in this reference book, while superceded and discontinued models are presented as being current. There are many typos, not mere misspellings but also erroneous, misleading information. I couldn't escape the feeling that this is just a big copy-and-paste job, and in my opinion their info can't be taken at face value. If you add this thing to your library, be sure to verify for yourself what they say."
1,Only new firearms,"I recently bought and returned the Shooter's Bible 2000. After looking through it, I was very disappointed only to find only newest firearms. I own previous editions that listed new and antiques. If you are buying Shooter's Bible 2000 to price antiques you wont find any."
4,"That's right, an index of NEW firearms.","If you want something that lists collectible firearms, look for something with the word ""COLLECTOR"" in the title. Meanwhile, the Shooter's Bible is an invaluable source of information for someone seeking information on NEW or recently manufactured firearms. Not much else like it available, and it's updated annually."
1,"Hard to use, incomplete, missing many firearms","I've used many firearms reference books over the last 10-15 years. This was the biggest disappointment. I found the book difficult to use, but the most troubling was the missing firearms. 3 guns were not listed at all. The fourth was listed generically, but not enough information listed to cover all models. No price range was included. Just the top end price and these prices were very high. The more informative books I've used give price ranges based on the condition of the firearm and definitions of the various conditions of the firearms. With all the firearm reference books out there, I would choose one other than the Shooter's Bible."
1,jewish encyclopedia,"very disappointed.promised 12 volumes and received only one. i got ripped off. they showed a picture of 12 volumes and what a disappoint when only one arrived,"
2,Misleading book for Treatment of Depression,"How to Win Over DepressionI found the Book Cover was misleading. My doctor recommended this book tome, however after the few first chapters (which I found informative), theovertones of ""You must redeem yourself to Jesus in order to win over thedepression"", was offensive. Not everyone has the same Christian beliefs.If you are a devout Christian, then this book may be for you. It isn't for me. Thank you."
4,Very good sunblocker,"This is definitely a quality product. Its kind of expensive but works as moisteurizer and sunscreen at the same time with good quality ingredients. Recently changed to Khiels fuel because it feels better in the morning, but this was a good buy."
4,good stuff,"I researched tons of spf for the face and hate the stuff that goes on white, and requires that you rub and rub and rub till it blends. Forget it if you have facial hair.this stuff seems to work pretty well and has helped my complection on the left side of my face. I'm in sales and drive around all day everyday in Southern Cal. SPF 15 wasn't doing the trick. so far this stuff works well. It's been about a year and ready to order more."
3,oiless sunblock,"this product is really not very greasy, but it hard to apply, and it does not protect you for the sun pretty well, also if you have sensitive skin this product is not for you, it tends to irritate the skin once it is in contact with the sun"
5,Great cover/ case,"This cover works great. No complaints at all. It even came with a belt clip so I can clip on the waistband of shorts that don't have any pockets. The clip is kind of hard to get on/ off whatever it is clipped to, but it is not a big deal to me."
1,disappointed,"One of the pitfalls of ordering online is not being able to page through a book. I went on recommendations.The book is nicely packaged and looks like a Bible. However, the format of the book is like a dictionary/picturebook. I was looking forward to a good read with lots of interesting facts-- this is just bits an pieces. In my mind it's not worth the money."
4,"Excellent, but a bit out of date.","This book has great introductions on each distillery, and good whisky reviews. It's almost a whisky encyclopedia, describing the different regions, production methods, varieties of whisky, etc.The only problem is that it's getting to be an old book (1997) and so lacks any info at all on a lot of fabulous whiskies that have come on the market in the last 15 years..."
5,Lover of Whisk(e)y,"This book is very informational. Because i read it, i am now a lover of fine single barrel bourbon. Love it and read it often. It's American and I love it. Have given this book as a gift at least 7 times.Mark Oates"
2,Sparse,"Mr Gabanyi's book contains a lot of information. However, it seems to me that he consulted other whisky reviews far too often. If I had wanted to read what other reviewers (i.e., Michael Jackson!) had to say then I would have purchased those (that) reviewer's books. Moreover, Mr Gabanyi's book is not even close to comprehensive. In many cases he does not give tasting notes. That defeats the purpose of the book! Save yourself some money and buy another Whisky guide."
2,Didn't hold too well.,"Unless I was using this product wrong, it did not seem to hold the pant hem I used it on for more than three times wearing the pants."
5,ladies of comedy,this group of movies is excellent choice of grouping. all of the stars are extremely funny. i've always been a great fan of bette and dolly.so don't hesitate order it.
5,Love these guys,I've been hooked since their '96 Irving Plaza gig in New York (cost me $7 to see them) . This is different but just as good as their first CD. These guys still know how to rock. May their be many more CD's to come!
4,Surprisingly Good!,"I baught Spacehogs first album on the strength of their first single, In The Meantime, alone. I wasn't overly impressed. With the Chinese Album, however, Spacehog proved to me what a grand band they can be! With diverse music ability, catchy hooks and intresting, if not obscure, lyrics, this album should be their breakthrough. If you're looking for a Beatlesque album sung by David Bowie, Prick Up Your Ears in the direction of The Chinese Album!"
5,One day...,"This album will get its due...hopefully...as one of the best albums made in the 90's. Like Faith No More's ""Angel Dust"" is considered now this album is a landmark in craftsmanship. Some music puts you in a mood, and some puts you in a place. This is one of those albums. The first track ""One of these days"". Do not listen to it if it is snowing out...it will forever embed that vision and feeling in your head whenever you hear it again. It's that encrypting of an album. The songs latch on the things in a bizaar ways, they carry their our mystique. They bring you back but not to times to places and visions. Its a powerful thing to be able to create. Only albums like The Wall, Tommy, etc have been known to do that. For one to come out of a 90's band is bizaar. Spacehog in this CD is like no band you have ever heard. Its very individual."
5,YYYYYYYYYESSSSSSSSSSS!,This disc is the most fun I've had since hitting rocks in the house at age six!
3,Bowiephiles take heed!,"Although it doesn't boast a single as immediate as ""In the Meantime"", The Chinese Album stands on its own as a tribute to glam rock, with a few faint echoes of Radiohead thrown in for good measure. The complicated structures of songs like Lucy's Shoe and Second Ave hark back to the good ol days of Roxy, while Mungo City is pure Bowie. For those Stipe hounds out there, he rears his shiny head on Almond Kisses, a hoplessly catchy sparkler, and the closer, Beautiful Girl, is so shimmery it will make you sway. There are some duds,(Skylark and Carry On are a bit tepid) but as a whole a step forward from Resident Alien. Can't wait to see what they do next."
3,A few good songs...,"This album has about three or four astoundingly good songs. Unfortunately, those are the only good ones out of twelve. If you have money you don't know what else to do with, try this CD."
4,A personal favorite,"Probably sentimental favorite from college. Journey's End was solid and enjoyable all the way through. I'll Be There has some forgettable tracks but some very good ones as well and the title track is a hoot. I think Fisher had a real nice feel for singer-songwriter style pop. The keyboards are terrific and he writes solid lyrics. The tunes are varied and memorable. His only real drawback was the lack of a strong voice, but he covers that up with studio magic. I was delighted to find this in such good quality!"
1,Do not odrer,"Do not order these for your Tacoma. They do not fit. They have a fitment chart on the back of the package and clearly says size ""C"" for Tacomas and the ones I got were size ""B""."
3,MUD FLAP,"THEY NEED MORE IMPROVEMENT ,REASON THEY DON'T COME READY TO INSTALL YOU HAVE TO MODIFY THE SIDE TO HOLD THEM THEY ARE TOO SOFT NEED TO PUT METAL AT THE SIDES"
2,Kay Harmonica Pack,You get what you pay for. Get 7 harmonicas for the price of one and well its not so good. 3 of the 7 harps have reeds that are blown out after very little use. Unless you are buying this for the kids suggest you invest the xtra bucks and pay for a decent harp. Thanks but no thanks
2,Mediocre at best,"This CD is valuable for the person, like me, who wanted to get a cheap CD with some of the great Russian classics that you don't find on the typical best-of Russian classical music album. It features a fairly good recording of Gliere's Russian Sailor's Dance and one of the few available recordings of Glinka's Kamarinskaya and Overture to A Life for The Tsar. Both of these are good pieces, and are played acceptably well on this album, but that's where the good stops. It will cost extra money to buy other albums that have good recordings of Russlan and Ludmilla (my 2nd favorite overture of all time) and the Russian Easter Overture, but it's worth the money. Unless you really don't care about the insufficiencies of this fledgling (and small) orchestra, do not buy this album."
2,Not Bad but have to be better alarm clocks out there,"Ok, my intial take on this was nice looking, dual alarms, great deal. I was wrong! Don't be misled, this may have dual alarms but one is for the radio and the second alarm is a buzzer. Why would Timex possibly create an alarm clock where both alarms couldn't be radio alarms? I hate waking up to that annoying buzzer sound but now between my wife and I, one of us has to. Second, the viewing angle is poor, it's hard to see the minute digit if the clock is facing slightly away from you. The screen is recessed into the clock so the side of the screen blocks your view of the time. Third, the date is so large on the screen it is almost confusing because it's right up agains the time. I know that's being picky, but figured I'd mention it."
4,Best for the price.,It has some down sides as you would read from the other comments but Timex is the only brand I have found that you can set up to alarm only in weekdays. The radio may be poor but I would rather prefer poor radio than waking up 7 am on saturday or not waking up at 7 am on monday. You don't have to worry about whether you turn the alarm off on fridays and turn it back on sundays.
4,Love the MP3 feature,"I like to listen to radio stations while I cook. Once a while I wish I can listen to my MP3 songs without taking my laptop to the kitchen and get all greased up. I bought this unit yesterday and I do not have any complain so far. I hooked up my Sandisk M250 to the radio and the sound that came out was pretty decent. The AM function was little weak when I was testing it in a CircuitCity store but it turrned out to be fine in my ninth floor apartment. The FM reception is the strongest among the three radios I have. All other functions worked as advertised but the button placement needs improvement.I bought this radio for its MP3 input function and its small footprint. AM and FM were secondary. Similar products from other manufactures cost far more and are too bulky. I do not need a CD player in radio. If this product can last 6 to 12 months, I will buy another one to replace my old, simple but long lasting Sony alarm clock."
1,Not really a TIMEX,"Firstly, and this should tell you right off it's no good, it's not made by Timex but by SDI Technologies. Apparently SDI has licensed the Timex brand. Secondly, it's NOT super loud. Thirdly, it's just a horrible layout. Don't think you're going to hit the right button when you're half asleep. Horrible clock period!"
5,Another great from the late Great C.S. Lewis,I love this book probably because i served with the Royal Green Jackets in the British Army which are the desendants of the 95th Rifles.It is very well written and i felt I was right there along with Dodd trying to get back to the British lines.I wish i had read this book as a young Rifleman in my training i think it would have made me a better squadie.I recomend this book to every young infantryman.Its a must read.
3,"SIMPLE, BUT MISUNDERSTOOD BOOK","The income tax is not necessarily an investigative matter, and this small booklet bares this out. The purpose of this book is to show that an income tax was deemed contrary to the principles established in the US constitution in 1787. With numerous presidents and statesmen declaring that such a tax would bring the young republic right back to the doorstep of tyranny (which is exactly what has happened), the idea is to stimulate debate as to why, then, do we have an income tax in the US today. It's simple, it's short, and it's essential reading for anyone who pays a US income tax. Additionally, the book reveals why Congressman RON PAUL is right on the money with his platform of abolishing the income tax."
3,Unhappy,I resent the fact that these older books are being published as if they were new books. When you look at the published date you can't tell it was actually written 15-20 years ago.
3,Overall good with some frustrating parts,"I love Jayne Ann Krentz's books. This book along with its predecessor has an interesting storyline with great descriptions. The reason for the 3 stars is the female lead is pretty annoying. She does the normal run into stupid situations with no forethought like any other female lead to move the story along but if she didn't have half the dialogue written here, I would have been perfectly happy. It's like she has no concept of brain/mouth filter based on appropriate situations. Will It stop me from reading more if there was another book? No. The supporting characters made sense and the overall storyline is good and the author is awesome."
2,Not that interesting,"I did not find this particular book as spell binding as her other books, therefore I was not interested in any other books in this particular series."
3,Krentz dream trilogy books,Books were very similar in content and short. Content that was similar was repeated in each book before getting to subject matter.
2,boilerplate subject and writing,"although I usually like Krentz's writing, this particular book wasn't worth the money. Very standardized plot and characters, no vision beyond boy meets girl and fall in love. I like a plot with more substance."
4,the empress file.,"Very well written, the story line kept my attention and kept me reading. I really enjoy the adventures of Kidd and his assorted friends, never a dull moment."
4,Kidd and LuEllen are back!,"This is the second book in the Kidd and LuEllen series. It is much lighter than Sandford's Prey series, but is quite good in its own right. The dialogue is great, and the plot is complex yet easy to follow. There are also some quite funny parts. The story shows that the lines between right and wrong, good guys and bad guys can often become a bit blurred."
2,Marginal,"Compared to other John Sandford efforts, this was forgettable. Development of character and plot, direction of movement, and motivation were all lacking. This series is his weakest effort."
2,Sanford's attempt to make a social statement obscured his plot.,Sanford was out of his element. I was very disappointed. I expected another of his plots in which I could get lost.
1,Not So Great,"I finally stopped reading this book at 54%. The story gave me problems in several ways. One was Kidd and Lou Ellen committing crimes with poor justification. Another was choosing such a poor and vulnerable place to live during the caper - a houseboat (can't get away, sinkable, big and easy target, etc, etc). This book did not flow like his other books."
4,Kidd and LuEllen return,"This book follows the continued escapades of Kidd and LuEllen from the book ""Fool's Run."" It seems the characters have wised up a bit since the last story, and this book enjoys the same great writing and pace that the ""Prey"" series has.A very enjoyable fast-paced read.Great for Sandford fans who need something to read while waiting for the next ""Prey"" book to be published."
1,Book defectivetive,The book was defective in that some pages were duplicated and thus some pages were missing. Such a shame for a book that I'd like to pass along... Will amend this if seller responds.
4,Like a refreshing summer breeze.,"The 'Gran Partita' (Serenade no. 10) is arguably Moazrt's most Bach-like composition; its self-generating joy in structure, variation and counterpoint revelling in the possiblilities offered by the wind instruments (oboe, clarinet, basset-horn, French horn, bassoon, double bass) and their interplay. There is a real Baroque spirit, although Mozart is warmer and blither than his master, and the German Wind Soloists seem to get (and give) as much pleasure out of playing the piece as any jazz improvisors, or a seaside brass band.This is not to say Mozart doesn't exploit the characteristic wistfulness of the wind instruments: his Adagio and Romance hauntingly evoke the Romance of 'Einekleinenachtmusik', while the closing Rondo, though rich and exhilirating, has a sleepy, old-world melancholy reminiscent of the the theme music for 'Mapp and Lucia'."
3,"Good group of titles, some disappointing performances","While I have owned every PP&M album in every format as well as every corresponding music book, I probably won't play this one very much. As the title suggests, many of the performances are campfire quality. The PP&M versions of Michael and the Garden Song are especially disappointing. There are good performances on the disks (recorded many years ago), and it's a good price. If I had young children, it would probably get more play. While I bought it to keep my collection complete despite only a few ""new"" recordings, it will probably gather dust on the shelf."
4,Peter Paul & Mary - a nostalgic experience,"If you like(d) PP&M in the 60s, you'll love them now. A couple of songs I've never heard, but the majority is a collection of songs taken from their albums. A trip down memory lane, and just hearing songs like Blowin' In The Wind, This Land is Your Land, If I Had a Hammer and Down By The Riverside, to name a few on this 2 disc CD, brought me back to the days when we protested peacefully because it was our right; now I'm afraid to send in my dues to the ACLU because I might end up on a list somewhere. Pretty tragic."
4,"Peter, Paul & Mary Around the Campfire",Around the CampfireWe bought this CD for my mother because of all the songs on it that she has sang at different summer camps. It has brough back lots of memories and would recomend it to anyone.
5,Just old fashioned fun campfire songs,"These are great sing-a-long songs for campfires or roadtripsfor any age. Some songs I've know forever and some I had neverheard of but enjoyed learning and now know by heart.This is fun, fun stuff for all ages."
5,Great!!,This is a great CD which I will use for my Girl Scout troop. I have been looking for songs like these. We listened to this CD at home and MY 2 girls just love it.
5,One for all ages,"This is an excellent compilation of all the songs you have heard Peter Paul & Mary sing throughout the years. My three-year-old daughter enjoyed ""introducing"" this CD to her 70 year-old grandparents who were delighted with all the songs they remembered. There are slow songs (Kumbaya) and fast songs (Daddy's taking us to the zoo tomorrow). The memories will flood back to you and you'll be surprised that you know the words to almost every song!!"
3,"Excellent results for size and weight, but zoom is a problem","This lens gives good results except for two weaknesses. First, the diffractive optics causes little ""donut"" hot spots in images when areas are exceptionally bright i.e. reflection off a lake. They look a bit like the donuts of a telephoto mirror lens. Second, the zoom ring is very hard to turn. It doesn't have the fluid smoothness of their other zoom lenses. It's acceptable in use, but barely. You have to put so much force on turning the zoom ring that you have to take the camera away from your eye to do it. Very inconvenient, since you could miss an important moment. These negatives a countered by the lens' small size and weight. With it, and Canon's 17-85 zoom, you can cover nearly every shooting situation. Given its weaknesses, however, it should sell for less."
3,"careful , less sharpness , compact but very heavy","careful , less sharpness , compact but very heavynot recommended for pro users , nice for prorate and user how want to won tow lenses only"
5,The Ultimate Travel Telephoto Lens by Canon,"Every lens has its advantages and disadvantages.This lens is tailored for shutterbugs seeking a travel-friendly, telephoto zoom that can deliver nearly the same image quality as a large L telephoto zoom lens (emphasis on ""zoom"" versus ""prime""). My copy of this lens is as sharp as my copy of the Canon 100-400 L at all focal lengths. However the 100-400 delivers a slightly richer image because it can capture a greater range of hues (Although software can improve the DO's images.) The DO is vastly more portable due to its compact design; even with the lens fully extended, it's shorter than the 100-400 fully retracted.When traveling or when I don't want to carry a big lens, the DO is my telephoto zoom of choice."
3,Too soft for my 5D mark II Canon,"I have to agree with the comments that the zoom is too stiff, not smooth at all. It makes it not fun to operate this lens. But the biggest problem for me is the softness of the images, not acceptable at this price range. My Canon 5D takes super sharp photos with my other lenses, but this one irritates me every time I use it. I am selling it and buying something else."
4,Praying with Benedict,Praying with Benedict is an excellent introduction to Benedictine spirituality. It has been a successful book for group sharing as well as for individual prayer.
2,Not bad for beginners...,"Overall, the teaching was okay. Footprints, slow motion, and showing separate lead/follow movements make this easy for beginners. Expect to learn the basic step and one turn for each dance. Instead of this video, I recommend picking one dance you want to learn and getting a video that is more in depth. It's hard for someone starting out to learn so many dances at one time, even if one only learns the basic step. Also, they used the same awful music throughout the video even for very different dances. This makes it difficult for beginners to distinguish which dance to use for different music...that's one of the most important things to learn in dancing!"
2,Not all that hot,I bought this tape for my husband who has no idea how to latin dance and he got more out of watching the movie Dance with me than he did the tape. It is very very basic and is very brief on each style. I recommend picking a dance and getting a tape related to that style and learn that way. This is just to basic.
2,not satisified,"- book based on version 18 (not up front specified. Can be confusing when you are a ground ""0"" beginner and using 2000i. - No glossery to speek of. Spent 12+ years working 2D Cadkey. Glossery no where near covers the the explaination of terminalogy needed."
5,a great classic movie on dvd,super dvd of a very rare film i have been looking for a long time for this title I love to watch films starring Yul Brynner excellent picture joe from MALTA
1,Disappointingly Incomplete,"The original theatrical release version of this film is interesting and reasonably well done. Anyone who may have read the book upon which this film is based will see the stories original plotlines including the stories most important thread about the Stevenson character, played by Richard Widmark, and how he finally overcomes self destructive memories. This dvd has apparently come from a film copy in which the scenes, depicting how Stevenson finally overcomes the ghosts of his past and comes to accept a brighter future, have ben deleted. By removing these scenes the film really loses most of its best qualities.The Yul Brynner character was not in the original book but takes the place of two other people in the story. This works well when coupled with the rest of the original story.Without the original scenes I would strongly recommend that purchasers stay away from this dvd."
4,Boyds Bible Dictionary,A good study tool for names and meaning of names. It gives you a greater insight into the character meaning of names and places.
2,interesting read,"In any intelligent thinking human who HONESTLY wishes to know the truth and is not looking for more comfort derived entirely from ancient made up stories intended to provide comfort to those who didnt have science to answer their questions, doubt is a natural normal response to information provided without any proof (or logic). Religions only chance at survival is to paint doubt as a bad (or evil)thing. This book continues to push that agenda. Faith is not a noble thing. Faith is willful ignorance and fear. It is VERY dangerous to ""live by faith"" . The 9/11 hijackers lived by faith.Teaching people to dismiss logic and reason in favor of magical beings in the sky has been proven VERY detrimental to those who decide not to follow the religion of the region."
2,It Had Potential,"This movie had a good story. The movie would have been better if the story hadn't been taken out of it's originally intended setting. I haven't read the book, granted, but from the characters, and lines, I got the gist of it that the story was originally set in a mansion in England. To me, the setting and portrayals of characters did not fit the story. Otherwise, the story itself was good, it was the presentation that left some to be desired."
3,WHAT CAN I SAY????,"I'll explaine the movie in one sentence: Go see the 1999 Universal remake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now the rest. An okay movie with a tired premise. The same thing with the new MUMMY, but Stephen Sommers completely re-invented the mummy myth. This HBO/direct to video movie uses the same Karloff/Lee formula from the 30's in the 90's, but tries to make it EXITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Where is the Mummy in this movie! Richard Karn shirtless!,The only problems with the movie is where is the mummy ? also for fans of Richard Karn you can see him shirtless ! this movie is wannabe that is seemed to go more the erotic than actually have a mummy in it! It's Ok for a rental in either DVD or VHS!
3,Al Borlin,Al Borlin stars in this mummy flick supposedly based on a work by Bram Stoker (Dracula). It is one of the better mummy flicks ever made.
3,"A ""B"" movie for the '90s...","If you're looking for a classic tale of horror and suspense, and life beyond the grave, pick up ""The Mummy"". You know, the one with Boris Karloff. Universal Studios, 1931. If, however, you fancy yourself a fan of incredibly chessey ""B"" horror movies, then this is a good one to see. Particularly if you like to watch the old Hammer movies. This is along the same lines."
1,"Poor acting, poor script, poor effects, awful movie.",This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot makes no sense and the actors seem to have never rehearsed any scene. I'm amazed tripe like this can even get released.
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"This was one of the wrose movies I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, script worse and the effects terrible. Do yourself a favour do not buy this DVD, the picture quality and sound are also below par. A very bad film on a very bad disk. Amazon are generous with a 1 star limit."
2,Fair,I saw this movie and thought it was so-so. It wasn't very scary. Only one scene got me but that was at the end. If you want to see be my guest but I did warn you.
5,Definitely Sucks,"Much more suction power than previous models. B&D finally resolved making the body easier to detach from the charging system. Just one tiny oversight on their part. While the accessory tools are nicely tucked in, when you use them, there's no place to mount the original tool. Overall, great product."
4,Works just fine.,I have owned this product for over a year. It works fine for odd jobs around the house. After a year I have used 2 air filters which seems reasonable.
4,Better than most...,I like this dustbuster because it's so much faster than getting the big vacuum out just to sweep the hall as it is the most traffic area in my home. We have 3 cats in the house and they jump out of the litter box and release litter onto my hardwood floors. In one zap I can get all of the litter up and it's much powerful than previous brands I've owned.
4,Works Well,Replaced my old battery powered Vacuum with this one. Like the longer battery life and easy clean feature. Owned 1 month and no complaints
4,Great buy,"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I run around sucking up dog hair and kitty litter from corners everywhere! I only wish I had a holster for it! :) Buying one for my dad for Christmas. Only 4 stars because it doesn't pick up much heavier items than hair, fine dirt, & kitty litter. But that's what I needed it for, so works for me!"
4,Quick & Efficient,"This dustbuster provides strong suction and has a very clever filter that can be easily cleaned. It doesn't make a mess when being emptied. Has a little trouble picking up stuff on textured surfaces, other than that I would highly recommend it!"
3,"Loud, Sucks and Not The Right Kind","We have been using this B&D Dustbuster for about a month. On low speed it's loud and on high deafening, it will wake a sleeping child. The reason it will wake a sleeping child is because it takes so long to lift the smallest speck of cracker. With all that noise one would expect more suction. Oh and don't start at the far end of the debris pile cause the exhaust will blow everything on the floor. The location of the exhaust was poorly thought out. The plusses are that it is more convenient then pulling out the big canister vacuum, relatively light weight and maneuverable and the see through bag less container for what it eventually sucks up makes it easy to know when its full."
5,I use this for everything,I wasn't too sure how powerful this was going to be but I am glad I bought it. I use it on my daughter's high chair - there hasn't been anything it has not sucked up yet. I also used it to clean the cars and it was so much easier than bringing out the shop vac and it worked great. Definitely worth the money.
2,"Disappointed, it really is a ""DUST""buster","This works ok if you are just using it for small pick ups, but I was hoping it would be strong enough to keep my car clean - very disappointed. Also, it is very difficult to open it up and clean it out."
4,This Sucks......Buy it!,"This hand held has about the same suction power as a full size vacuum. We own a dog and I'm able to use this vacuum to clean up dog hairs from virtually any surface, even embedded hairs on carpet and fabric sofas. I even bring this vacuum in the car when me and the dog go on rides for clean up. The crevice on board attachment is great for doing stairs and along the walls. It's definitely the most powerful hand held on the market today. I hesitate to give it a full 5 stars due to poor battery life. Otherwise, it sucks!"
5,Awesome!,"This vacuum is awesome!! I have 3 cats and a teenage boy, so there's always a lot of cat fur and food bits on the floor. This vacuum sucks up the fur, crumbs, chunks, and could probably suck up one of the cats! It's great! I loved it so much I bought 1 for the upstairs, and 1 for the basement as well!"
5,I liked it so much I bought two.,I read the reviews here on amazon and few other places and ordered this vac. After using it two days I ordered a second. We have owned a few different types of cordless hand vacs and this is the best one of the lot. It is really powerful and using the vac with the wall mount is easy.
5,Love it!,"I have had a lot of portable vaccums and this is by far the best I have had. It keeps the charge longer, charges faster and it picks everything up easily. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,It's got horsepower,"I read all the reviews (good and bad) on this dustbuster. I had just broken my wife's previous one trying to ""fix"" it, so I was in a hurry to replace it and keep her happy. I ordered it without telling her and surprised her with it when it arrived. She LOVES it! It's got all the power it needs to pick up anything it was designed for and works well. It's a bit pricey, but it seems worth it so far."
2,Good for small jobs only,"This is a good product for picking up the occasional small mess that would be too much of a chore to drag out the full-size vacuum. Cleaning it after using it is more of a chore than I expected. The filter has to be cleaned well and then even washed; letting the filter go uncleaned will reduce the power of the vacuum's suction. It is powerful and I had no trouble picking up almost anything that you would pick up with a normal vacuum. The battery power lasted long enough for doing small jobs well. In the end, I sold it at a tag sale as it was just too much trouble to bother with."
3,Just very ok,"This DustBuster is just very ok. The power is ok, seems like it makes a lot of noise and it sucks up good when it's the right angle. Also, I wish the cover to keep the dirt wasn't see-through. It's a little gross to see all the dirt, etc in there. Bleh. Also, I saw the same exact thing at a retail store for half the price (no, it was not on sale!). That disappointed me because I always thought Amazon had the best prices. All in all, it's just ok."
4,Black & Decker CHV1500 DustBuster,"A competent hand-held vacuum. The delivered item is exactly as advertised. With limited use so far, it seems to do a fine job. Noisy, but not excessively. Delivery was prompt, as usual. No complaints so far..."
3,Helpful Tool To Have,I purchased this so I wouldn't have to drag out my big vacuum for little spills. This does the job just fine. I've had better though.
3,qustion for filter,"I have a question for the filter. I read that the chv1400 dustbuster's filter VF100 can fit in this dustbuster CHV1500. Can I assume vice versa the HEPA filter for this CHV1500 dustbuster can also fit in CHV1400? The question is because I already have a chv1400 and if this works, I can just replace the filter and it becomes HEPA vacuum. I sent the question to black & decker support but got no reply."
5,Dustbuster Kicks Dust,Love this product... it is my second one! Works like a charm and picks up what I want it to pick up! Highly recommend this to anyone!
5,Simple to Use and Easy to Empty.....,"I replaced an old hand-vac with this Black & Decker Cyclonic Dust Buster. I am very happy. This vaccuum is powerful and very easy to empty; you just take the nozzle off, dump the contents into the trash and put the nozzle back on. That's it. My old hand vac required you to practically take the machine apart and remove the filter before you could empty it. This machine was more expensive than my old one, but it was worth it!"
2,These vacuums SUCK (in both a good and bad way),"The good: has a filter just like a regular vacuum (after numerous smaller handhelds, we finally figured out you needed one like this), so the suction is good. Wall mounting, easy to charge. Nice attachments.The bad: Ni-Cd batteries. This technology is like 30 years old. They use it because they know the product will die after about 6 months. These companies should be shut down for destroying the environment. You might say, well just buy one with a Li-Ion battery...good luck, Hoover makes one for $150. Dyson makes one for $250. Neither mount on the wall. The Hoover has all kinds of suction problems...so you are FORCED to purchase something like this. Oh well, we'll just buy a new one every six months and send more Ni-Cd to the landfill..."
3,Good for quick cleanups,"This is good for quick cleanups and cleaning tight crevices. I bought it hoping that it would be better at picking up pet hair, which it does not do. It is still great for around the house though."
3,Good for bare surfaces... not great on carpeting,"I was disappointed on how poorly this dustbuster works on carpeting. When I used it to vacuum up cat litter on my carpet, I ended up getting out my big vacuum to finish the job. I was hoping that by now, Black and Decker would have figured out how to make a Dustbuster that works well on carpet. However, it does work well on bare floors...I'm glad I bought it for simple, fast clean-ups on bare surfaces. I like the design. It's easy to handle. Easy to clean. Again, would recommend for bare surfaces."
5,this is a keeper,"Great romance novel, it's a keeper, I have already re-read it and several excerpts of course from it since I bought it. I can't wait for the next one. Hurry, keep them coming."
4,Calling of Emily Evans,"This was so interesting and I will continue reading this series and appreciate the fact that Emily was so faithful, loving and caring."
3,Historical Fiction,This is an author I enjoy. Inspirational historical fiction is a choice I will always consider. This is a fast read with pioneer traits.
4,Inspiring,"While the book got off with a slow beginning, as it unfolded it was a delightful story of faith unfolding"
4,Enjoyable,I enjoyed this book and would surely recommend it. The setting was early western days and very fun to read.
4,OK,"OK, a bit religious but OK Not much else to say duh You want too much duh less would be appreciated"
3,Nice Story,a nice story that reminds us to rely on God. It was a bit too predictable and a bit to perfect. Still Oke is a nice writer.
5,5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! well worth the money!!!!,"this compilation is a godsend for fans of 41st side snipers the imfamous mobb deep. the videos are to quality. the audio is awesome.this dvd leaves nothing to be desired, save the 2 mobb deep videos that are'nt on it."
3,Solid effort and debut of Mark Turner,"The setup of a excellant array of musicians and a tune list that covers various textures and feels does not always provide a great recording. This Cd has all that and Mark Turner is a talented and very good musician,but as technically solid as this recording is, It did not evoke any emotion from me,nor did it feel soulful and passionate. Its a good Cd but lacks the emotion and passion and the wickeness true Jazz fans need."
1,"Okay B westerns but one is from a pathetic, butchered print!","I picked this one up at the Dollar Store and it was still overpriced. These Tex Ritter Grand National B westerns are about average for poverty row oaters but ""Arizona Days"" is missing the middle 15 minutes or so (probably one complete 35mm reel). There is an abrupt cut 20 minutes into the film that makes you say ""Huh?"". Running time is 42 minutes instead of claimed 57 minutes on packaging. The print is also horribly out of focus and splicy and looks like it was sourced from a VHS tape at EP speed. Maybe it's best those 15 minutes are missing. I don't know if my eyes could have taken 57 minutes of such poor quality video! ""Trouble in Texas"" is complete at 63 minutes and the print is barely passable. Young, beautiful Rita Hayworth (billed as Rita Cansino) is the highlight of this one. Lots of stock rodeo footage pads what little plot there is. Don't expect very much...and you'll probably still be disappointed!"
1,Buyer beware,"These two Tex Ritter films are being sold for one dollar by retail chain stores in a cardboard sleeve without shrinkwrap. They can be identified by the ""Treasure Box"" logo on the bottom, left corner of the sleeve backside.These films would be great entertainment if the source material was good. Trouble in Texas is better than Arizona Days which looks like it was taken from a VHS copy. Arizona Days is fuzzy and there are missing frames plus occassional out-of-sync audio. Trouble in Texas is sharper focus and appears to be from a 16mm print.While you can purchase this disc for $1.00 at Walgreen's and other chain stores, it is only worth buying if you want to watch Trouble in Texas. My low rating is not a reflection of the films but this release of such."
2,A waste of time,"The title implies a solution to the very practical problem faced by many of us in trying to quantify the effects (ROI among them) of marketing communications. The authors affirm that it is impossible to disentangle the effects of all communications (ads) by the firm and its competitors, not to mention all other contacts customers have with the firm. That I knew.Finally one comes to the grand spreadsheet for solving the riddle. But instead of any useful ideas on how to actually MEASURE the effects of advertising, one is instructed to plug in what amounts to an ASSUMPTION of how your brand advertising will change customers' share of requirements.As a working researcher, this was extremely disappointing to me."
5,Measuring Brand Communications ROI,This was a very strong book as it gave you a good conceptual overview and then went one step further in giving you details about how to move forward with ROI measurement. The spreadsheet and floppy disk were also an extra in helping you attain an action plan. The other key element that I liked was the the side bars and detailed marketing examples.The authors gave a good presentation of real world marketing applications as well as strong theory regarding the future of marketing communications. Overall a very good book that all marketing management should read.
4,ROI is what people cares these days!!,"For anyone involved in marketing this book gives very practical advice. A common complaint about business books is that they are all OK in theory but contain little in the way of explanations of how to do it - this book however offers not some good case study. Overall very impressive and a must read for anyone involved in sales, advertising or marketing functions. Another book I highly recommended is 60-Minute Brand Strategist by Idris Mootee. This book is LOADED with super solid, meaty real world branding insights and techniques that can are being kept as trade secrets. You will probably find this book a real eye opener. If you're looking for a more balanced marketing book, suggest going for David Aaker's books, some Kotler's books."
5,Awesome,"Simple yet elegant. Sophisticated and sexy. The quality is far greater than I expected for the price. My wife loves it, it blends well with her bracelet."
3,"Cute, but does not emphasize counting","This is a cute book for the preschool set, and the photos are definitely neat & eyecatching. However, I feel that, as a counting book, it is lacking. Each page (or set of pages) features a number in the corner & then the photo depicts that # of penguins. The sentences in the text, however, do not include the #s themselves, so it is easy to just whiz by the #s, instead just reading the story & forgetting WHY we are doing so----- to practice COUNTING! As well, the text goes by readers so fast b/c of the so few words on each page, that there is an inability to focus on the STORY, much less the COUNTING."
1,VHS Grandview USA,"VHS Grandview USA was from a rental store and was completely ""locked up"". Vendor was very good about offering to replace or refund. Since there was no other copy available, he immediately refunded my money (including shipping) back to my credit card.I would do business with him again with the same understanding.Thanks."
4,Green Plaid Shirt,very interesting dvd & I enjoyed this very much and the acting was good. The story line kept my attention and the actors were hot.
3,Green Plaid Shirt,The story was common to the genre not particularly exciting. It was again Ok but not the most memorable gay movie.
5,Great songs + top-notch musicianship = Excellent record,"From the opening jumble of feedback, this record lets you know where you stand in relation to the band - preferably a few yards back, and with a good set of earplugs (and I mean that in the most complementary way possible). The songs are crisp, the lyrics deal with subjects we all have a shot at relating to, and the band members definitley know how to play their instruments. The album leaps off on a brisk pace and keeps it up throughout, with the exception of the Title track, a lovely little piano-accented tune. Standout tracks include ""97th Tear"" and ""Dancin' when you're down"", a barn-burner complete with horn section that closes the album with a fist. My favorite thing about Gaunt is that they don't seem afraid to keep sounding like Gaunt; a rare trait these days. No, they're not floundering in a rut, they simply don't feel the need to abruptly change sounds to prove to us that they're musicians. That's a mighty good thing."
2,Disappointment.,"Gaunt used to be a great punk rock band. Now they sound like Matchbox 20 at 45 RPM. Who cares? Maybe I'm being a little harsh on this record, but when compared to ""Sob Story"" and ""I Can See Your Mom From Here,"" ""Bricks...,"" with it's MTV-ready songs and slick overproduction just doesn't cut it. ""Anxiety,"" ""Mixed Metals,"" ""Duh,"" and ""Dancing When You're Down"" are good tunes, but 4 good songs out of 15 isn't a good score. Get the first two albums instead. Good loud rock music is supposed to sound raw."
3,slender design,I love the slender design to fit into spice jars but the small print makes it very difficult to read the measurements.
3,Alanis shines,"Alanis shines through the murk of much of this CD. ""Uninvited"" is vintage-Alanis: her voice sounds better than ever and she invests the lyrics with bitter passion. Love it."
3,Alanis and Goo Goo Dolls are good but....,"most of the other songs on this album are kind of boring. All in all the soundtrack was ok. Too bad you can't get the ""Uninvited"" Single."
2,"Bad Movie, Bad Soundtrack","Well unless you like cheesy music, i.e. Goo Goo Dolls, Sarah McLaughlin, Paula Cole & water-downed version of U2, don't get this album. But if you liked that corney movie, this will be right up your alley."
2,Only one song worth listening to,"The only good song on this cd is Uninvited. I know a lot of people like Iris, but it's played on the radio way too much. I'm sick of it now, and all the other songs on this disc are awful!!"
1,wanting more...,"I found one thing wrong with this soundtrack, it leaved me wanting more music from the artists that are on it. To me the c.d. was like a teaser of a couple of REALLY good songs by artists that haven't had new music in a while, surronded by lackluster music by other wanning stars.(U2 anyone?) This soundtrack just left me wanting more of Alanis Morrisete. If her song wasn't on this thrown together piece of garbage, I would'nt have gave it a star!"
4,City of Angels,"Iv'e never written a review on a Motion Picture score before. What promted me were the unrealistic asperations voiced by the people who did write a review on this trac - It follows the movie. Sure 'uninvited' is a great song - but that is not the entire genre of the movie. I paint to Hendrix all the time. Compare the litrature to the subject, and maybe you will get a drift as to what a motion picture sound trac is about. But then again ,you might be emplagued with the unability to apply poetry to situation and go back to the Armegedon sound trac, because it all sounds the same , -not bad , but it has little to do with using your mind to try and grab on to, concept, theme and song'which is different to a a collection of same type of music repeated over and over on an artist's CD. Think about it, would 'univited' caught you're attention before? Do you know what the song represents? Think ..."
4,This Cd is awsome!,"I like most of the music on this CD, except for the few songs like ""Red Road"" and stuff like that. Otherwise, this CD is one of my favorites in my whole CD collection. I think it is a must-have."
4,A Good one!,"This has become one of the most successful soundtracks ever, and I think nearly everyone would enjoy this CD. It includes three big radio hits - Alanis Morissette's ""Uninvited,"" ""Iris"" by the Goo Good Dolls, and ""Angel,"" by Sarah McLachlan. They are all three good songs. I also liked the U2 song, ""If God Would Send His Angels."" The surprise stand-out was the Paula Cole song, ""Feelin' Love"" - a wonderfully lusty song. The score material at the end is also pretty. This album is very good, and a soundtrack essential to any collection."
3,Schizophrenic,"Most soundtracks content themselves with one type of music to match the movie (alternative, pop, whatever). This one combines several light pop numbers with a couple blues/rock items. A few too many of the pop numbers don't make much impression (Paula Cole and Jude, especially), but the Goo Goo Dolls ""Iris"" is fantastic pop, and Alanis' ""Uninvited"" nearly so, with just a few clumsly lyrics to detract from it. Peter Gabriel's track is long but effective. The blues/rock numbers seem a bit random, especially the choice of Jimi Hendrix's ""Red House"", but they certainly are good. The closing score music by Gabriel Yared is quite effective, as well. A decent buy, and hey, you might expand your horizons on accident."
4,A harmonious compilation of musical artists,"As far as soundtracks go, City of Angels is the first in some time that actually gives the feeling of the film without having to see the visuals. The combinations of artists, while diverse, works well. The bonus of the entire album is Jude Christodal who's track "" I know"" is hauntingly beautiful. I feel as if I have been given a gift to be exposed to this music for the first time and immediatly went searching for more of this artist's work. As always, Gabriel Yared's work is splendid, moving, enchanting. Any avid soundtrack fan should have this one in their collection."
3,IT'S GREAT!,"I think the ""City of Angels"" CD is pretty good. With it's variable rock and ballads it makes for a very entertaining soundtrack. I personally recommend the song Iris, by the Goo Goo Dolls, the best song on this soundtrack!"
5,Best CD I own,"This is the best CD in the whole world. I especially likeed Goo Goo Dolls ""Iris"" . Since I live in Switzerland, the CD costs more. I decided to buy it anyways for about 25$ and loved it. I was definetly worth the price I payed."
5,Runs through your soul,"When I bought this cd, I hadn't seen the movie. But I still loved it. It has some great songs for loving and losing someone. I loved ""Iris"" by the Goo Goo Dolls. That's one of the reasons I bought the cd. I love it!!"
3,you can't please everyone...so why try?,i think that if a score had been released rather than this soundtrack more people would be better able to understand the film. we all understand words like pop hype awesome and what they have come to mean - nothing. the lyrics of most of the soundtrack's tracks really get in the way of the music - which i think could stand alone as instrumentals.
4,Pretty Darn Decent,"I am so sick of people going crazy over the songs ""Iris"", and ""Uninvited."" They basically suck. The absolute best songs on this album are ""Red House,"" ""Angel,""I Grieve,"" and Jude's ""I Know."" I haven't yet seen the film ""City of Angels,"" and I don't remember why I bought the album, but it's basically pretty decent-sounding."
5,A Beautiful CD,"I purchased this CD after my Dad passed away. I love the music & the words...they made me feel closer to him even though he has moved on. I truly feel that for anyone that has lost a loved one, listening to this will give you a feeling of peace and serenity."
4,NICE VARIETY,"This soundtrack probably has one of the most intresting varieties of artists. It has artists like Alanis Morissette and Paula Cole to Hendrix and Eric Clapton. There are also some beautiful instrumentals. My favorite tracks would have to be the power ballad ""Uninvited"" by Alanis Morissette and the haunting ""Angel"" by Sarah McLachlan. ""Iris"" by the Goo-Goo Dolls is also a great song. For someone who enjoys soundtracks or just great music,you definately should add this to your collection."
4,One Diverse CD,"If I could sum this Cd up in one word it would be diverse. There is everything from Jimi Hedrix to John Hooker to Sarah McLaughlin. If you are eclectic in your music choices this is the CD for you. I love the first track by U2 which shows a different side off the group all together and of cousre the hot ""Iris"" by the Goo GOo dolls. You also my be surprised by the last 4 tracks by Yared. They are beautiful intrumental peices that I find wonderful to fall asleep to or listen to rain with, and do yoga with. I do admitt I don't listen to all the tracks but it is worth buying for the last 4 which I think are absolutely beautiful."
2,If you're a fan of rock only....,"... Then you'll find out that only two songs on this soundtrack - the ones by Alanis Morisette and Goo Goo Dolls - are worth listening to. The classical overtures at the end by Gabriel Yared certainly is also enjoyable to some extent, but overall the CD has far too many different genres of music all criss-crossing each other which can be too much of a variety to some. I for one personally don't see what all the hype on McLachlan's 'Angel' is about. A number of other tracks has been underrated by the majority of critics which is a shame to say the least."
4,A Great Soundtrack,"I wouldn't have bought this for ""Iris"" alone (although it is a great song), but the songs by U2 and Sarah McLachlan I was already familiar with. I love Alanis and Peter Gabriel, so how could you go wrong? Go get it!"
5,this c.d rocks!.,This is one of my favs. The songs flow well in the movie. The music is beautiful. Each song expresses and makes one remember certain moods and feelings of characters throughout the movie.
5,Outstanding!!!,I bought this CD because of the movie. I always try to listen to the music when I am watching. The minute I put this cd in was when I was painting my room. This cd has great tunes on it. I was impressed with the whole thing. The movie was great.
5,I love this cd,"Personally, this cd is what made me change what I listen to and made me start liking all different kinds of music. I love this cd and it has variety for everyone of every age. Feelin Love and Angel are two of my favorite songs and that was an excellent choice to put those songs on this cd. I love this cd."
4,Just the one and only,"Good all-around soundtrack album. Great album comes along with a great film. Feeling love, sang by Paula Cole is a definate collectors item. MUST BUY!!"
4,Quite eclectic.,"This album has a little bit of everything: moving instrumental tracks, heart warming songs, a good helping of real blues, and some of the most mindless pop drivel I've ever heard. I don't know who decided to put Alanis Morrisette and the Goo Goo Dolls on the same CD as Peter Gabriel and John Lee Hooker, but it doesn't work too well. It gets a little annoying to reach for the skip button every time Uninvited and Feelin Love come on, but the worthy tracks more than make up for it. Peter Gabriel couldn't sing badly if you held a Bob Dylan album to his head, and ""I Grieve"" is one of the most beautiful things he's ever done. Clapton and Hendrix are in fine form as always, Gabriel Yared does some wonderful work, U2 does a fine job with their contribution, and even Sarah McLachlan sounds good. The album's worth it overall, if you can look past tracks 2, 4, and 7."
2,not very good,"i really wanted this cd. i asked for it for my birthday and i got it. but when i put it in and listened to it, i was very dissapointed. i wasn't expecting all of the old music. i really wouldn't recommend this soundtrack."
2,"Not that great, but then, it is a soundtrack.","I actually got this CD for free; it was given to me by someone who knew I liked ""Iris,"" which is by far the best song on the album. The CD will fool people: you'd think that with Alanis Morisette and the Goo Goo Dolls, the whole album would be mostly alternative, but it sounds annoyingly jazzy to me. The Alanis Morisette song is decent; the Sarah McLachlan song is also pretty good. If you are like me and love only ""Iris,"" however, don't go for this CD, buy ""Dizzy Up the Girl."" You'd probably enjoy it more."
2,Doesn't quite live up to it's hype,"When the summer started there was a frenzy about this soundtrack for the City Of Angels and I got caught up in that frenzy and purchased it. However to my disapoint, I realized there where plenty of better soundtracks out there than this. I did enjoy the songs: What If God Would Send His Angels, Uninvited, and Iris. But those songs are constantly blaring on the radio anyways. As for the rest of the songs on the album, these songs are not much to my taste. I rated this album two stars because I felt it fell short of expectations with all those big name singers on the soundtrack."
3,It's pretty good.,"Although it's not the best soundtrack I've heard, it does have many good songs and music in it."
3,Okay CD,"The CD is good because of 3 songs by Goo-goo Dolls, P. Gabriel (he's the best!) and U2. Alanis' is okay but nothing to write home about. I didn't like the movie either. I thought it was too slow, there was something missing. Soundtracks are nice when you like the movie. So if you liked this movie, I say definetly buy the soundtrack!! Why not?"
2,Jimmy Hendrix and Peter Gabriel Only,"At the beginning, I though this was a reasonably good CD. But then , I realized that this is an utter crap. Only the underrated Jimmi Hendrix and Peter Gabriel themes are woth listening, but if you want them, ask someone else to reord them in a cassete."
5,Awesome!!!,"This is the best soundtrack I've purchased in a long time! I LOVE Iris and Uninvited! I also love Angel by Sarah McLachlan. That's an incredible song that doesn't get much publicity. Everyone who owns this CD, go play number six-- RIGHT NOW!"
4,bitter sweet,"Like the movie, the soundtrack is filled with passion and heartache, which make some of the best songs. A good, solid lineup of songs."
3,Simply angelic!,"The soundtrack from this memorable movie contains some really great songs. First, I mention Alanis Morissette, one of my favorite singers, and her song ""Uninvited"", which was released before her second CD (Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie) and had everyone clamoring for it. I love this song for its musical simplicy and unique lyrics, and it is the number one reason I bought the soundtrack, because this song is not any of Alanis's other CDs. But there are a few other gems on this album, such as the Goo Goo Dolls' ""Iris"", another popular radio hit, Jimi Hendrix's classic ""Red House"", U2's ""If God Will Send His Angels"", Sarah McLaughlin's ""Angel"", and Paula Cole's ""Feeling Love"". I think that each song is a good representation of the movie's theme, and it is worth buying because it is one of those albums I think people will listen to and love, then put away for awhile, and later dig it up again as an old treasure they're glad they remembered."
5,Great Soundtrack!,"This soundtrack is slammin'! Best songs are ""Angel"", ""Iris"", and ""I grieve"". The movie and the soundtrack go great together! All the songs are great. One of the best soundtracks ever! :)"
3,"Mostly good songs, a few duds.","I got mixed feelings about this CD. While I loved ""Iris"" by the Goo Goo Dolls, liked U2, Alanis Morrisette, and Sarah McLaughlin, most of the other songs lacked character. The CD starts out strong, it dies down until track 6. Then after track 7 there's really nothing very good. I think it would have been better had they stuck to the soft angel type songs instead of adding jazz sound too. I found Paula Cole to be out of her element, Peter Gabriel didn't know when to stop his much too long song, and John Lee Hooker and Eric Clapton were disappointing. I'd recomend it to people who like both soft and jazz sounds. Otherwise just get the ""Iris"" single!"
4,great combination of songs,"This cd combines many really fantastic artists and makes a great mix of music you'll never get sick of. The popular music is great, and the classical music at the end is great for studying to or as background."
4,A worthy soundrtack,"Jimi Hendix's ""Red House"", is a classic that nobody should miss. Goo Goo Doll's "" Iris, is a beautiful but sad ballad that shows how to write a GOOD radio-friendly song. Alanis has her most inspiring song ever (though her second album is somewhat disappointing). Paula Cole fails in including ""Feeling Love"", one of the worst tracks of ""This Fire"". U2's ""If God will send his Angels"" is a Catchy ballad, but never comparable to "" One"". Finally there is an every time darker Peter Gabriel, who still knows how to do a beautiful but dark at the same time song. The somewhat trip-hopish ""I Grieve"" has the same effect that had ""Mercy Street"" twelve years ago."
5,Heavenly!,"The melancholy new Peter Gabriel song, I Grieve, is one of the highlight songs of 1997. There are much layers too the song and it can be appreciated in many different ways. Other tracks, such as Morrissete's ""Uninvited"" also contributes to make this one of the best soundtracks ever produced."
2,There are much better recordings out there.,"The fact that I gave this recording only two stars has nothing to do with the works performed here. Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" are true masterworks that never age. They are brilliant and priceless musical gems. However, this is not a very good recording of these works. I'm still trying to put my finger on what exactly is wrong. The tempos are a bit sluggish, and it's way too heavy for such lighthearted music. And yet, this doesn't quite describe what's really wrong with it. Maybe a large part of the problem is that there are so many superior recordings. I can't listen to these works without hearing great performances of them run through my head, which makes this recording even more difficult to sit to. For one of the few times that I've ever encountered, this Naxos release is truly not a bargain."
3,A sound handbook,"A simply written and thorough manual covering the rationale for and design of research into customer loyalty and satisfaction. It is written for the researcher rather than for the user of research. The early chapters establish the link between customer behaviour, customer satisfaction, loyalty and profit. The rest of the book works through exploratory and detailed research, PR, forecasting and related topics."
3,"A good tool to understand the ralation between satisfaction, loyalty and profitability.","It is a theorical aproach to the topic and the customer behaviour, mainly from the service point of view. A good tool to undersstand and elaborate satisfaction surveys, from the sample to the results."
5,Nash trap beats Victor traps10 to 0,"I tried to use Victor Traps for years, but did not get a Mole. They do not seem to penitrate the ground. This summer I got 5 Moles with the Choker Mole Trap."
4,A decent trap,"The Nash Choker Loop trap is a decent design. It is well made and easy to use. I found that I was able to improve the trap's performance by using a strong U-shaped wire (look at picture of ""Rainbird Galvanized Tie Down Stakes"" - coat hanger wire will also work)about 4"" long to stake the base of the trap near the spring directly to the ground. Otherwise the moles were able to raise the entire trap up and tunnel right underneath it without tripping it. By fastening the base to the soil, the trap would stay in place and when the moles tried tunneling through the trap, the raising dirt would pretty much guarantee that the trigger plate would release."
4,Waiting for more moles,I am very pleased with the 2 nash mole traps I purchased from Amazon.The warm weather brought the first mole of the season I set my 2 plunger traps on the ends of the mole runs and the Nash traps between them the plunger trap was triggered with no results but when the mole tried to get by the nash trap it was lights out for him.I have asked my neighbors to let me know if they have a mole problem because I have the solution with the Nash trap.
2,requires a substantial hole to operate,"I purchased several mole traps recently. This one requires that the mole tunnel be large, deep or that you must dig slots deeper than the bottom of the moles regular tunnel. The moles I was trapping were making runs just under the grass. This required more digging than the others and for that reason alone it is not my favorite. especially since there are mole traps that are easier to set and in my case caught moles."
2,Not recommended,We have tried this product everywhere and followed directions to the letter. We still have yet to catch one mole!!!
3,An uninspiring pianist,"Yes, this is a great budget recording, but that is no excuse for an overly simple pianist. Jeno Jando has put no soul into this music. It is only composer, no performer. That is not music! I'm sorry, but I have owned this recording for a few years, and with each listen, I become more disinterested. Jando seems to have no interest in making the performance his own, and plays like a perfect student. All of the notes are in place, but the performer is nowhere to be seen. I saw this in his recordings of Liszt and just about everywhere else. However, if money is an issue, this recording is excellent for the Pictures as well as Islamey. The smaller pieces are very interesting as well. Mussorgsky, unlike the comment from an above reviewer, was a very well developed composer with a unique style. All in all, though, this recording is just ""ok."""
3,An unexciting promenade.,"Naxos provides warm, natural sounding 1988 piano recording for this collection of Russian music. Jando provides a plain account of the exhibition pictures themselves and the spectator's response to them. He also provides some additional short piano pieces by Mussorgsky - mildly evocative but very minor indeed - and Mussorgsky's own piano version of the Gopak from his unfinished comic opera ""Sorochintsy Fair"". Balakirev's oriental fantasy ""Islamey"" makes major technical demands on a pianist, but it too receives plain treatment here.Those new to these works are advised, if they like them, to shop around for other recorded versions, bearing in mind that none will be as inexpensive as this. Of Victor Hartmann's pictures, which inspired Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"", only three survive. Has any record company shown them in their enclosed liner notes?"
2,gotta have gospel gold,I thought I was getting a dvd instead I got a cd . So I was only ok with that and somewhat disappointed. Sorry. :(
2,a waste of money,horrible book... i got a 5 exam because i threw this book away and got the 5 Steps To A 5 one. that one was MUCH better than anything in this one. most of the material in this book was not on the test
5,Read with an open mind.,"The previous reviewer Daniel Owino is obviously upset by the contents of this book. I urge readers to make up their own minds.I take objection to the Mr. Owino's reference to ""these people,"" referring of course to us - the Jews. And this sets the tone for his frantic antisemitic diatribe.Enjoy this book or not it's up to you.Shalom."
3,Nice book,I enjoyed the book. The photographs iside were excellent. The only reason I gave it three stars is because it was WAY TO SHORT. I only wish there was more pictures and backgound. As far as its delivery goes. The book came on time and in perfect shape.
5,An excellent guide to the reptiles of Europe,"I am a soldier in the U.S. Army stationed in Kosovo for 6 months. I bought this book to try and identify any reptiles that I might encounter while serving my tour. I could not have made a better choice. The book covers all of Europe west of the Ural Mountains (including Ireland). It lists all amphibians and reptiles withing that range. The keys are very well written, and the corresponding line drawings are exellent. The book also covers many of the variations that occur withing the European lizards. I would recomend this book for the above reasons, over any book that only covers western Europe/Britain because this book also covers easter Europe, which is becoming more and more open to the west every year. This book could be a very big help to any herpetologist who is planing on travel anywhere in Europe, especially on the identification of the lacertids."
2,AMAZON REVIEW,"I think there is one item which is still on the way, I havent received it and I think it is this one. But as soon as I get it, I definitely will post my Full marks on it."
1,Check item as soon as it comes,Not sure what type of car this is for but its not the item I specified. Too bad I did open the package earlier.
4,Heard it in the late 80's,"I first heard Suites 1&2 in the late 80's; by Slovak Philharmonic, on tape. I have been and still am intrigued as I envision a story unfolding as the piece progresses. There is the use of subtle strings, dynamic horns and bold strings, quiet passages and demonstrative crescendos (and other orchestral elements) which makes this a masterful piece. After hearing several other orchestras perform Bizet's Carmen, I just have not enjoyed them as well. This is DEFINATELY A GREAT LISTEN."
3,DC New Frontiers #1,Disappointing. I like Darwyn Cooke and have several things by him. The artwork is nice. So-so story. Too much space wasted on the war with the dinos. Too little space spent on gold and silver age period of DC history. Disagreed with the direction. Not recommended.
3,ok...,"i'm not really sure what all the hoopla about the new frontier is, because it's ok at best and shallow. it's more boring than anything. it's mostly a reimagined green lantern story (and martian manhunter) with cameos by the other dc heroes.average"
5,i love the book and the way it was writen made it fun to read.,i forgot whar a great author wilder was. even thougt it was in play form it was easy to read and to keep up with the plot.
4,Rather Good,I havent had the pleasure of listening to Brad Mehldau live but if this CD is representative then I cant wait. There is more invention here than on the last few Jarrett trio recordings. Cant wait for him to release a solo recording. This is the best so far of the three trio recordings released.
3,Demonstrates potential but lacks finesse,"This recording demonstrates Brad's potential but as a stand alone recording it is very mediocre. The trio is not together and you get the sense that bass and drums at times struggle to follow where Brad goes. He also goes into directions which I would deem unnecessary, as another reviewer said, pretentious. Don't get me wrong, Brad is pedegree and this is demonstrated in the subsequent CD ""Art of Trio 3""."
3,On target off-tangents,"3 1/2AoT 2 features, as usual, some spectacular and highly unique solo phrases that run joyfully off-course until returning to familiar territory, but the synergy here essentially feels like a mere warm-up to the phenomenal vol. 4 return."
3,Sinister print!,"Sinister Cinema's print looks like the same TV print I taped 20 years ago-with the same sound defect in the beginning (a sprocket-like sound that fades after a few minutes).It's a good movie, a nice example of film noir, and apparently still very rare. At least I have it on DVD now."
5,Artistic Gold,I pray that this band gets this CD back in print and their next one. I bought this one through a inventory music club 4 years ago and I fell in love with it. The lyrics are from the heart and the music rocks. I am in my mid thirties but I feel like the teenage boy who cried out to the Lord in anquish and found his cry answered by love. I only had the opportunity to listen to some downloads of Red Revolution and I would like a copy. This is a band to look all over for.
2,I really wish I could have enjoyed this more,"I wanted to like this so much. Really, I did. But there was one flaw that I just could not get past, and her name is Irene. The character is already difficult to sympathize with, but she might have stood a chance if it weren't for the grossly miscast Gina McKee. I don't doubt McKee's acting ability, but she was a mistake for this role. Her stone coolness was a bit too cold. Her interpretation of Irene is not the sort of woman that would cause this kind of ""enchantment"" of so many members of this family. I just don't believe it. I didn't believe passion at all, and she had three different chances to try to prove it to me. I don't like to judge anything until I've finished it, but I had to grit my teeth any time Irene was on screen. This made it near impossible to enjoy some of the pros, like Damian Lewis's extremely convincing Soames. Yes. Because of Gina McKee's interpretation of Irene, I actually found it easier to sympathize more with SOAMES."
4,fresh change in movies,It is nice to see a fresh changes in the movies seen on TV. Looking forward to Series 2 when it comes out
2,"Entertaining soap opera, but...","This production was basically a good yarn for Sunday night television. It is not worth the tape price, however, since it does not do justice to the nuances of one of my favorite novels.The one thing this version does accomplish is not so much to create sympathy for Soames as to divert it from Irene. She comes across rather accurately as self-centered, intolerant and smug. After three readings of the novel, I can have no sympathy with a woman who passes all the emotional costs of her mistakes on to others. Soames Forsyte, the ""man of property,"" certainly got the worst of that bargain.I have not seen the 1969 version, but from what I have read it is one of best television series ever. I'm saving my money for the video release in January."
1,Huge disappointment,"I am a female, I use my hubbys account. Anyway, after reading the description of this series I went ahead & bought both seasons. HUGE MISTAKE & it only took half of the 1st episode to realize my error.The main female character looks like a mule and has the morals of an alley cat. I couldn't muster any sympathy"
1,Waste of Time,"This is awful! Bastardises the novels, screwed up plot. Faulty characters and sets 20 years ahead of themselves! Yeah! Frank Lloyd Wright was designing in Richmond, 1886 then took the next Tardis with Dr. Who! I don't know who slept with whom at the BBC, but this is an abortion. Do not bother at all. Get the 1967 series or better yet, read the books."
1,Horrible version of the Forsyte Saga,"I would actually give this version no stars. Irene is wooden, can't act, and down right ugly. She actually makes Soames look good. If possible, see the version with Nyree Dawn Porter (or any other)."
1,Terrible DVD Quality - Frames Freeze Up Every Five Minutes,The DVD quality is terrible - I tried in another DVD player and it was the same thing. Do not buy!
1,If Fornication floats your boat!,The costumes and cinematography were well done. I just really have a hard time with movies that have Adultery as a main theme.
3,"Irene, as played by Eleanor Roosevelt.","Not a spot on the original b/w series, if you loved that youwill have serious problems with this version. For me, noneof the lavish production values and ""updated"" emotionalinterpretations can cover the central casting problems.Soames and Irene, around whom everything else revolves, arehard to look at, ugly people. Gina McKee (Irebe) is an awkward, gangling, horse-faced heroine, and Damian Lewis (Soames) is rather a red-headed albino. Recommended only for those who didn't""start"" with the 1966 series."
5,Outstanding - Superb - Sublime,"There aren't enough adjectives to describe this modern masterpiece. Poignant, heartbreaking and totally insidious, it grabs you and doesn't let go. The casting was spot on and the performances are incredibly subtle with every nuance played just right. It's a brilliant Victorian soap and, like any good soap, it sucks you right in!"
3,"watchable, but forgettable","What's everyone getting so excited about? This is nothing more than a soap opera where everybody dresses in Victorian clothes. And unlike, say, Austen or Bronte, there's nothing deeper here: just a whole bunch of adultery. In Galsworthy's mind, there is apparently no such thing as love flourishing when it is permitted to do so: to him, the only real love is forbidden love.One of the things I found infuriating was that the swelling violin music was implying that you're supposed to be sympathizing with the screwball adulteress, Irene, whereas when I was watching it, I was siding with the supposedly evil Soames the whole time. From time to time he behaved dishonorably, I agree, but I felt that he was far more sinned against than sinning, and that he was the film's true hero.Alas! The filmmakers didn't seem to agree and kept trying to get me to hate him, which rubbed me the wrong way through the film's length.And the director apparently never met a close-up he didn't like."
2,Good Cast but with a Story Problem,"In this version, the Soames Forsyte character is a tragic man, but not evil or mean. Irene on the other hand is a real creep. She marries Soames for his money and never gives him a moment of happiness. Then she gets into a passionate affair with Soames architect which she makes very public knowledge, humiliating Soames at every turn. It is really hard to have an ounce of sympathy for Irene. This show would have played much better if Soames was more of a jerk and Irene was less of a jerk."
5,Forsyte Saga Series Loved it,Forsythe Saga series 1 Great it was a pleasant surprise to see Damian Lewis in this. I loved the series and Homeland. Great Costumes as well.
4,Great Cast Stands on its own merits,"Remakes can be a tricky thing. Many long for the past. Some say there is only the present. The present remake of the Forsyte Saga can stand on its own with its excellent cast, writing and cinematography. Acorn has presented us with a magnificent remake. I'm waiting for the continuation of the saga. What the ""Magnificent Ambersons"" lost over the years was enhance and added to in this the first round of the ""Forsyte Saga."" Mr Behrens will be please (as I am) that the original ""Forsyte Saga"" is scheduled for release February 25, 2003 (See BBC America now and this site NOW). The quality of production in the DVD format is something that ACORN can be proud of. Buy it! It's a keeper! ACORN tells us that the next installment is already in process.Roderick"
2,A disapointing rerun of a classic masterpiece,"I read 9 volumes of Galsworthy's classic and watched the Eric Poter version on PBS twice. This modern version is a terrible disapointment. Obviously low budget and abbreviated it did not capture the essence of what it means to be a Forsyte. It fails at that point.The existence of the Irene/Bosinney affair is a fundamental feature of the story. It is the fact that the affair occurred that is important. The drawn out sordid details of the details of it went on too long and are boring and irrelevant. With due respect to the beautiful and talented actress, the casting of Irene is a disaster. Young Jolyon is marginal. Winifred's role was misunderstood. The role of June was simply overdone. The producer, director and production crew are too much influenced by soap opera and refuse to bow to the classics. I concede that the classics may be judged as simply high class soaps. But high class makes an enormous difference."
1,Dreadful aspect ratio,"I'm not sure what happened with the transfer to DVD, but it looks as if the picture were transferred from anamorphic widescreen to fullscreen with no compensation for the aspect ratio. Everyone looks as if they were in an El Greco painting (tall, thin and distorted). The facial closeups make actors look as if they are leering into the camera because of the distortion. I have a headache after 10 minutes of this DVD. I never been disappointed in a DVD transfer before, but this one is unwatchable. I assume that they will correct this once enough have been returned, but in the meantime, avoid this version."
1,Yucky,"This cd is sissy. Im going to have to put most of the blame on the vocals. They're like listening to fingernails scratch down a chalkboard, not to mention they're ambiguously girl like. But that's just my opinion, I like WHAT they sing about, I just prefer a more ""hardcore"" approach, I guess. I don't know if hardcore is the right word, but if you want to know what I mean, check out Matchbook Romance."
1,This album is trash.,"Every Saves the Day album is a masterwork. Except for this one. It is awful bordering on unlistenable. Do yourself a favor and pretend that it doesn't even exist. I don't know what went wrong, but Sound the Alarm (their next album) fixes it. Buy that one instead."
3,Mixed Emotions,"Ok...I'm a big saves the day fan. I love their music, but I was a little, well, surprising. I liked the music, I thought it was great, but it wasn't really what I wanted from Saves the Day. What I wanted was the sound I loved from songs like Sell My Old Clothes etc. Its a great album, but not what I was looking for."
2,buy this only for an example of the term 'watered down',"like the world circa 1500 this cd is flat musically as it is phsically. it seems utterly devoid of any excitement or ear catching change, with so little variation the songs blur into each other in a manner that is good for ambience but ultimately manages to be utterly unspectacular. Thats what happens when over production removes everything decent about your band. The asexual vocals are still there, and jazzily rhtmic in a way that doesnt suit the band's early stuff but does suit this droll sound, also, the lyrics appear to have retarded with the spark this band once had.if i were you id check out 'on a wire' by the get up kids as an alternative."
2,Is this the same band?,"Like I said is this the same band. Chris' voice is hardly recongnizable. If you listen to their previous albums, and this one, he sounds a lot different. His voice was annoying sometimes in Stay What You Are and the other two albums, but now he is really high pitched and can not be listened to more than five times without you wanting to turn the cd off. They may have stated that they were trying to be like the Beatles in this album, and are definitely influenced by Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. But the problem is SPLHCB is an amzing album, this isn't. Lets hope a once amazing band can get out of their Power Pop phase and return to the Through Being Cool band we all love."
4,Easily better than stay what you are,"For those of you who liked Stay What You Are, you might not like this album too much [if youre a stubborn wart who doesnt like change]. but if you realize bands need to evolve their sound, you will LOVE this album. A short and sweet album that clocks in at about 35 mins, this album is easily addicting and some of the songs are simply amazing from a melody and the lyrical standpoint. Though its about 3 years old now if im right, I still feel like this album holds its own as a good album for STD fans or just a causal rock fan. I would say try it out even if youre wary that you wont like it.highlights of the album include: Tommorow Too Late [i think its the best song on the cd], Wed. The Third, Driving in the dark, and the title track: In Reverie"
4,"""Not Bad, Saves The Day has still got it""","This album isn't bad, the album's mood is the same throughout from track 1 to track 12. It's a smooth transaction of songs, you can barely notice when the one song ends & when another begins. In Reverie is more of a laidback emo album with some softer tunes to listen to, but if you like the more upbeat Saves The Day (I know I do), there still are some tracks for you: ""Anywhere with you"", ""Rise"", ""In Reverie"", & ""Where Are You"". The album, in my opinion, is one of the best that I've bought this past year in 2003. It's been underestimated by others, but I think that this album is a must for any fan of punk/emo rock, it's that simple. It's great, 12 tracks, not too many, & not too short (just how I like it, awesome). 4 stars baby!!!!!!!!!!Pardon me for the excitement."
2,Meh...,"A few good songs, but in general, I'm not digging it. If you're a fan of ""old"" Saves the Day, this CD is not for you..."
1,"Personal opinion: Different, not to my liking","Definitly a waste of my 14 bucks. I guess I was expecting the same Saves the Day I loved in ""Through Being Cool"". I listened to this CD once, and it will probably never see the inside of my CD player again. I'm a fan, so I bought it. Probably won't make the same mistake with them again unless I listen to it first. I can appreciate their creativity and growth as musicians, but they should have used their own advice and ""stayed what they were"". Pun intended."
2,What A Disapointment,This is weak. Weak. Weak. I used to really like this band. I've tried to like this record but it is too weak. Weak writing. Weak playing. I'm bummed.
2,This is Saves the Day?,"This is the worst Saves the Day album. It was almost as if they never really got going. I felt it was loose and was not catching at all. I thought it would be at least half as good as Through Being Cool, but sadly I was wrong. In Reverie did not even come close. In Reverie was by far a big disappointment. The best thing I can say about this album is that it is ok, if you have never heard Saves the Day's previous albums."
4,Probably the end of the beginning!,"I'm sorry to say this, but don't expect a ""Stay what you are"" 2 or else you'll be very disappointed. This cd hasn't much of a classic punk cd but like every group, Saves The Day changes artistically. This cd is very calm, the singing isn't agressive at all like it use to be. Nevertheless, musically, Saves The Day still at their top.It's different, but good, really good, just take the time to listen to it and relate to the lyrics."
5,Different but good,"I am a serious Saves the Day fan, now I was quite surprised by this CD as it is very different than all the older stuff, but I love it just the same. REminds me of like weezer or something."
5,In Reverie........in my cd player since release date!,"In Reverie is Saves the Day's fourth full length record. It was released in September. If any of you follow Saves the Day, then you will be happy/confused when you get this album. They have more of a laid back emo/punk sound now that i think is just pleasing to the ears. I have all of Saves the Days records and I believe that this one is probably on par with my favorite Saves the Day album, Stay What You Are.I would recommend this CD to anyone. i listen to music constantly and it's nice to say that In Reverie is an original sound that should be appreciated by any musician, or anyone that has a passion for music like i do."
4,"Can we officially kill the ""emo"" word?","This is a wonderful selection of very well written songs. The band has obviously matured and have hit their creative stride. This is evidenced by the musical growth on each CD. Fans of ""Cant Slow Down"" will probably not like this. As another reviewer mentioned, their is a definite Beatles (circa Sgt. Peppers) flare throughout many of the songs on this CD. It's almost a cross between the Beatles, and Sunny Day Real Estates later releases. To me, that equals good music.Let's drop the classifications. This is just good modern rock music."
4,Hmmmm,"Ok, i know how you guys feel, i was highly anticipating the moments until this album came out. Salivating more and more as the days until the release date of this cd came closer and closer, and then i finally got it and popped it into my cd player, the first three songs i'd heard and liked because i had listened to them online, but then once the other ones came in, i was disappointed. But ya know what, i was disappointed when i first heard TBC but now i respect and LOVE it as a CD, sure it was different from their stuff i had heard before, but that's what makes Saves the Day so great, all their albums aren't exactly the same, and after a while you really understand what they are trying to say. So for now I'll keep a positive mind in the hopes that once i learn all the words and get used to the songs, i'll really settle into this ""new sound"""
2,What a disappointment!,"I fell in love with STD for their unique sound, quality lyrics, and because I could rock out and sing along. They had a style all their own. Now I am ""in reverie"" of the good ole' days b/c this cd is pretty lame. Sorry STD, I feel really bad but what happened? I can't sing along, I can't tell one song from the next, and this band should no longer be considered indie-""rock"". Hopefully it'll grow on me.LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY!!!"
3,new cd,the new cd is a good cd but just not as great as what i expected from this awesome band... the new cd seems to lack the raw emotion that the past cds have had... it actually reminds me alot of weezer... go back to through being cools stylings!!!!!
4,In Reverie,"A different style to Saves the Day but still enjoyable. If you like their last cd, you'll enjoy this one...it's softer and less rock which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5. I really miss the sound of their old stuff but as all bands they have evolved and grown up."
3,What happened?!?,"First of all the vocals on this cd could break glass.He sings in such a high pitch.second ive found alot of the song sound very alike.I cant tell which is which.Its sad seeing STD going from Through Being Cool,One of the best punk cds of all time.To In Reverie that should be played in elavators.It sad seeing Saves The day die out,but i guess it had to happen someday."
3,it was okay.... i guess,"i was actually really disappointed with saves the day's new album. i understand that an artist cannot keep releasing cds that all sound the same but I really don't like the direction that the band is going. the only songs that i found tolerable where ""in reverie"" and ""where are you"""
2,Very dissapointed.,"god.. how i loved the old saves the day. the saves the day i used to know is fading away. the songs on this cd sound.. so much more different. im still going to love the old cds.. and the old std. and when i go to their show this saturday im still going to sing every word to every song they play, i just hope some of the songs they play arent from this cd."
1,WHAT HAPPENED!!!!,"first off if you like saves the day do not buy this album. this is not saves the day at all. big disapointment! i think the problem is that chris isnt a strong guitar player and on most of the cd he is singing and playing which is not an easy task, for anyone. please chris, put the gutitar down and keep to writing songs!! we miss you chris. we forgive you!"
2,"Decent, but strays from what STD does best","Don't get me wrong - this album is decent musically. The songs are well-written and well-executed, as we have come to expect from Chris Conley and the rest of the band. However, since the departure of longtime drummer Bryan Newman and second guitarist Ted Alexander, the songs have lost a little bit of the edge that was so appealing. Chris' departure from whinier, pop/punk to a more straight/ahead, mellow tone is alright, but in reality, the former tone, heard on STD's previous recordings, is what gives the songs flavor. That aspect is lacking on this record, and I cannot help but feel that the shift to California's Vagrant is pushing the band in the wrong direction musically. At this rate, STD is primed to become a second-rate copy of Built To Spill...sorry guys, but Built to Spill does it and does it better...I think you have to go (in this case, stick) with what you know."
4,one of their best!,"In Reverie definitely has to be one of Saves the Day's best albums. I'm a new fan but I've listened to their sound vary over the years from different albums and all of it is just plain awesome. Watch out, cause if you just sample one of their songs you could get hooked for a while. Anywhere with you is a hit!"
2,get the earlier stuff,This effort is much less fun that the last two efforts. I suggest getting those before this one
2,disappointing...but still decent.,"for fans of previous albums like 'can't slow down' and most notably 'stay what you are', this saves the day album is a pretty dramatic departure from what we are used to. sure, the compositions have grown up enormously -- listen to 'hold' immediately followed by 'tomorrow too late', and you will swear you are listening to two different bands -- but its a safe bet to say that legions of fans fell in love with saves the day because of the singer's voice.for this record, he changed it to something that is very hard to swallow for lots of us.the music and the lyrics are of the quality we have come to expect, and for anyone new to saves the day, this will undoubtedly be known as a great pop record, but for fans of previous material, used to the sonic splendor of 'freakish', the departure from the norm is a bit heartbreaking.here's hoping its just a phase."
1,disgruntled,"I don't get it. These guys used to be sooo good but this album shows that they seem to have lost all emotion in their music. I was really anticipating this cd, considering Saves The Day USED to be one of my favorite bands, but I was extremely let down. What happened to all the intense lyrics and hard core music? They totally changed their sound, and i don't know what group of people this new music appeals to, but certainly not me or a lot of their other old fans. If you want to check out some of their GOOD stuff, try the older cds. The best song ever is ""Sell My Old Clothes, I'm Off to Heaven"". As for this CD, I wouldn't pay a cent for it."
1,What Happened.,Changing to Dreamworks mightve been the worst thing that could happen to this one-time good band. Their old stuff on Vagrant rocked but when coming out with this new cd they completely changed their style to a Weezer-esqe tone. I really wish that this band wouldnt have sold out by going to Dreamworks and changing their style but they did. The Cd sucks.
4,HELLO CHRIS AND EBEN,HELLO SAVES THE DAY FANS OF ALL AGES THIS CD IS PUT TOGETJER VERY NICLEY AND IF U LIKED STAYWHAT U ARE THAN U WILL PROBABLY LIKE THIS ALBUM BUT IF YOU ARE INTO THEIR OLDER STUFF LIKT CANT SLOW DOWN OR THROUGH BEING COOL THAN IT WILL BE HARD GETTING USED TO. STILL SAVES THE DAY COMES THROUGH AND I RECCOMNED THEM LIVE
2,awe shucks,"Hey all. Welp from what i'm reading i'm going to agree with all of you. This album was rather disappointing. It doesn't make me like or dislike Saves The Day any more or less. I STILL LOVE EM! I'm just hoping for a come back.To me it seems like this album was just way over produced for it's own good. I don't know if something with management has changed or just the band, but it wasn't good.The singing is good but just doesn't seem right for the band from previous albums. a lot of the tunes seem too similar. and I just can't find what i've came to enjoy in the lyrics.I've noticed after listening to it a couple times that There are quite a few times where the old sound is there, usually just for a moment, but it is quickly covered up.Don't worry guys... I'll still buy your next album!!!"
2,I just don't know...,"what went wrong? kind of like the song on the album...It seemed they took every good aspect from their previous releases and left it out of this album. One of the best things about STD has been their ability to recreate themselves musically and lyrically while still retaining that ""thing"" that has made every CD awesome. I just don't hear that on this album. I'll admit I wasn't so sure about ""Stay What You Are"" the first time I heard it, but it quickly became one of my favorite CD's. I'm hoping the same will happen with this CD. Listen a second time before you buy this one."
3,Weezer is cool but saves the day was way better,I like saves the day plenty in fact they are my favorite band and the new cd is not that bad. On the other hand i have been waiting for ever for this cd and it dissapoints me. The old unique sound that they used to have has been lost. They sound a lot like weezer now. It is not bad but it is a let down to their name because i was expecting a great new and amazing album. Not to dis weezer but I want the old saves the day back 8(!!!
2,What happend??,Cant slow down and through being cool are by far their best cds....i could tollerate stay what you are but i dont understand what this new cd is. they just sound different and its not in a good way. The new cd is just alright but doesnt compare to the old saves the day.
2,"No, Chris Conley, don't do this to yourself!","Alright, i'll start by saying I've seen Saves the Day in concert 3 times and enjoyed every single song, and I own all their cd's, but this has got to be a joke. Honestly, they were leaning towards poppy stuff on ""Stay what you are"" but it was really well crafted and done without a hitch, but this album just needs to be thrown away. They signed to Dreamworks, (which I condone, I could care less if a band ""sells out"", I'd do the same for more money) and its almost like Dreamworks told them to make a Backstreet Boys record. The punk guitars are gone, Chris Conley's vocals are borderline Peter Brady at best and the lyrics just suck. They're out of ideas and I wish it didn't have to be this bad. Don't buy it, wait for them to realize their mistake and make a decent album."
4,Saves the day- In Reverie,"To start off Saves the day is the best band I have ever heard. With this cd they went for a softer sound almost like the band Mae. What I have heard was that STD's years on the road has got to chris's voice so he toned it down for this cd. The cd is still good it has a bunch of great songs but my favorite is still ""stay where you are"" and then ""through with being cool"" None the less you should definetly buy those three std cds and go see them in concert. They really are an amazing band and they are on the road with taking back sunday right now. So go get this cd along with the ""stay where you are"" and ""through with being cool"" and go see them."
2,What did go wrong?,"Stay What You Are could be my absolute favorite album ever. So, naturally I eagerly anticipated this album, but only to be extremely disappointed. Saves the day went through a huge change with the release of In Reverie, but sadly for the worse. The vocals are whiney and the music behind it is boring, a stark contrast to the ingenious music and mesmerizing vocals of Stay What You Are. There is some good in In Reverie, but it's a chore to find. If Saves the Day ever releases another album, and pray they go back to their roots."
2,Saves The Day Keeps On Failing,"Cant Slow Down is my favorite CD of all time. The lyrics are pure brilliance and capture the range of teenage emotions from love to heartbreak to boredom to plain disgust. On Cant Slow Down you can feel the emotion come through the speakers. Through Being Cool was OK but just didnt have the raw emotion of CSD. Then came Stay What You Are which was Saves The Days ""radio friendly"" CD which prettymuch put them into a mainstream audeince of stupid little ""emo kids"". It wasnt very good anyways. The new CD In Reveire is unlike any other Saves The Day. Its not ""emo""-its not ""screamo""-etc. From what Ive heard its more a cross between the ""alt pop"" that made Sub Pop big in the 80s/90s mixed with a bit of ""emo"" and some Cave In style ""space rock"". If you are not a longtime Saves The Day fan you may enjoy it but for a fan its just listening to a once brilliant band turn into something unrecognizeable"
3,Regression,"No, this doesn't sound like the Saves the Day you may be used to, but this album is not a bad release. However, this album is only half of what Stay What You Are is. The songs arent as powerful. The lyrics on this album are more mature than previous albums, but the music is not. It's a regression. Sure there are some interesting bass lines, but the guitar is a giant step backwards. Don't blame the newer sound on the new lable, Saves the Day made this album orriginally for vagrant. Give this a listen, but buy the previous releases first."
4,"In Reverie - Different, yes. Wonderful? Surely.","I bought this album not knowing what to expect, as I had only heard ""Through Being Cool"" previous to this album. The first time I listened to it, I felt that the music was very soothing, and that the melodies Saves the Day used were very harmonic and tranquil. Sure, this isn't ""Stay what you Are"", but it's still a very decent album.It;s the kind of album that makes you want to lie down for a while, smoke a cigarette, and read some lovely poetry."
5,New Sound strikes,"Im a big fan of Saves The Day but i havnt heard any of the new music before i bought In Reverie. ""Anywhere with you"" is the only one i have heard and as you all know...its a great song to kick off the CD. When i listen to the CD for the first time i wasnt used to the new sound but its amazing the way it all comes together at the lyrics. It really gets you into the music. I highly recommend this CD for anyone."
4,"dont be disappointed ,they 're still good","Saves the day...hmm... they are one of my favorite bands. i could just never get enough of their awesome music.As soon as In Reverie came out, i wanted to buy it so bad, now that i finally have the album im kind of dissapointed. They have a more poppy kinda flow now.. a big diffrence from their emo/punk feel in thier other albums: Stay what you are, Through being cool.They sound alot like weezer now.dont get me wrong,weezer is a good band but i never expected it form saves the day. the vocals and lyrics have changed pretty much..chris sings pretty high pitched now. the lyrics are really clean ,not much anger in them. This album is pretty good. they havent changed much..they still have that saves the day feel in every song. After a while i started liking the songs and now thier stuck in my head. i suggest you get this album.its not really something you can rock out to, but maybe something you can relax a bit to."
2,utterly disappointed.,"i love ""stay what you are"" & ""can't slow down"". both are amazing albums in their own light. but this is just.....bad. overproduction & half assed work by chris make this album one of the biggiest let downs of 03. now, it's obvious to anyone that saves the day's later material was influenced by the great Weezer, but with a more....dark twist. but this album was as if touring with =w= had led them to believe that they could be them. i tried to like this...but i just can't. some of the songs aren't horrible. but after about 5 songs it just gets boring. if this is the direction in which this once great band is heading, count me out."
3,fair,"I was a little dissapointed when In Reverie was released, but still its a good CD. It is nothing compared to old STD or Stay What You Are. Hopefully they will bring there old sound back into one of their new CD's."
1,Who is this??,"This can't be Saves the Day... the band who used to sing ""cut some flesh away, I'll carry this piece of you with me..."" and ""buy you lemonade right now if you were here... and then I'd throw it in your face, and I'd listen to you cry..."" (Rocks Tonic Juice Magic)No way.This new album just isn't that great, quite frankly. It's not up to par to their earlier works of ""Can't Slow Down"", ""Through Being Cool"", and the ""I'm Sorry I'm Leaving"" EP. It just isn't. ""Anywhere With You"" is a decent song, but that's about it. The dark humor is gone... the vicious lyrics that are so great for break-ups just aren't here.There is always hope though -- this album may have been an experimental or filler album of some sort... and Saves the Day can come back fresh and with overtones of the past."
1,If you thought you liked STD...,"Hoo boy. I bought this on the strength of their previous releases and was sorely disappointed. It may be a good album, but it's not my cup of tea. Not one song that made it worth buying, IMHO. If you like the older STD like THROUGH BEING COOL or other bands of that slant, don't waste your $$$. If you like overproduced wannabe Brit sounding crap, then this is right up your alley."
5,THIS CD IS AMAZING!!!!!!,"Now I know that all the ""Die-hard"" Saves the Day fans think that this album is aweful, and honestly they could not be farther from the truth. Their sound has progressed into something absolutely amazing. Although Chris's voice, and the overall sound of their music has done a complete 180 Saves the Day is still making incredible music no matter how you look at it. If you don't like their new sound, then don't listen to their new music, keep Can't Slow Down, and Through being Cool in your CD collection and stop complaining. I love all of the music that Saves the Day has released, and in my opinion it is only getting better with time. If you want to see how absolutely incredible Saves the Day is, go and see them in concert. It is a religious experience, and I guarantee you will not be dissapointed."
1,Track 2: What went wrong,"FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!! The fire theft album just came out, buy that. I've been listening to this album trying to find something to like, but goodness, i just can't. No emotion: it just seems like the album is just one long song. AND THAT'S BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT IN VINYL!!! So I had to stop to flip it. And the voice. What happened? Was he on helium? The liner notes didn't speak of the midgets grabbing his genitals. What went wrong?"
2,good but not great,"i love saves the day. especially ""Stay What You Are"" definitely in my top 5 favorites of all time. this cd however is much different from stay what you are, and although sometimes change is good, like for instance the change from through being cool to stay what you are (not that through being cool was bad, it just wasnt as awesome as stay...), this one was bad... most all of the songs are in minor, which isn't really my style... i like happier music. the lyrics are still great, but the music and singing just isn't the same. i recommend stay what you are."
1,Saves the day ROCKSSSSSSSSSSS,Yea right. I listen to alot of Saves the day and I was so looking forward to this new cd and i popped it in for the first time and It sounds good till Chris starts singing. I have never left a review on here till I was pushed to to save people from buying this S**T cd. Its a good cd if you want to laught at it with your friends cause it sounds like his balls are being smashed and forgot what to say.
3,Hum...,"Well as many bands have gone through stages, this is a first for Saves the Day, I think most people will agree that they sound ""Weezer"" like, and yes they do (not that weezer is bad, the blue album rocks.) but the band did tour with weezer, this album has some good songs, like ""What went wrong"", ""Rise"", and ""Anywhere with you"", its just not my style, my advice, : Buy Through Being Cool first, then Stay what you are."
4,"its not bad, just different","When I first bought this CD and listened to it I was kind of dissappointed. Chris' voice is different and so is the style of the music. Well after listening to it a few more times I've grown to actually like it. Artists change....you can't be mad at them for that. This cd is very good and i would recommend it to a devoted saves the day fan or really to anyone who appreciates good, original music. it's different but still good."
2,Way to Different!,"I got this album as a gift. i have trough being cool and stay what you are. those are 2 incredible albums. ive herd people sayed that Saves The Day matured with Reverie. i have to agree with them, but i also have to say that they matured in the wrong direction. they should of stayed with the path they were heading with Stay What You Are. i would not recomend this album to anyone who is a fan of the older Saves The Day albums. If you want a good cd by them go out and by Stay What You Are, thats a good album"
2,Horrible,"Now Im a fan of the old Saves the Day. The last album ""Stay what you are"" was a slight change of saves the day, but it was still a good album. Now this album is a major change for saves the day and its horrible. In my opinion ""cant slow down"" and ""throug being cool"" were the best albums they ever made. They've been going down hill since then. If you'd prefer older saves the day, stay away from this cd."
3,Stay What You...were,"Now let's get this straight- Can't Slow Down & Through Being Cool were two FABULOUS albums from Saves the Day, as well as the EP I'm Sorry I'm Leaving. Stay What You Are was a little hard to adjust to, as well as In Reverie. I'd have to say that the band covered a lot of ground changing their sound from a nice solid rock sound, all the way to...straight emo (well, almost)? There's no doubt they can pull it off, but my conclusion is that the band gained too many teenybopper fans (around Through Being Cool 'til Stay What You Are)& are in the midst of losing them with the drastic change (In Reverie). Whether or not this was the plan, it seems to have worked, & you'll have to allow In Reverie to grow on yourself (if you're a true fan). If you were completley disappointed & never listened after with Stay What You Are, don't bother; if your ears are open to all sounds and styles, go for it."
4,Do you even own any Saves The Day CD's??,"This is a wonderful Saves The Day CD. For all of you complaining that it's not ""the STD you love"" have no idea what you are talking about. How about you gather up all your Saves The Day CD's and sit down and actually listen. Every CD is ENTIRELY different. That's the beauty of STD. If they had just come out with the same sound that they had produced before there would be no point. It's still Saves The Day, but they have managed to effectively alter their sound. Stay what you are is still my favorite Saves The Day album but this is a good one too. If you enjoy listening to bands who have one sound and only one sound then go purchase an N*SYNC CD; however, if you would like to listen to good music then shut up and LISTEN."
3,Definately their worst but still OK,"Yeah so I just got this cd today.. finally. I was sooo eager to hear it because I've been a long time Saves The Day fan.. so I opened the package and popped it in my CD player and just thought ""WHAT THE HECK!?! this is sooooo not like them""... though it is very very different than their previous records it's still not too bad, but without a doubt it's definately their worst... definately pick up their other cds first if you don't own them already"
2,Extremely dissapointing,"I was very dissapointed with how boring this album was. Its too mellow, none of the songs are upbeat at all. Chris' voice lacks any excitement to it. I never listened to them for their lyrics but for their sound, and this new sound is pathetic. I bought the new Thursday album, War All the Time, at the same time and Ive already listened to it over and over because it has much more life to it, while In Reverie sits in its CD case. If you are a die hard Saves the Day fan, its hard not to want to buy it, but for a new listener, try their old stuff first."
5,awesome cd,"this cd is awesome. it is one the best that i own. i didnt listen to saves the day before this album and this is the only one i own. it is great, it never gets old. all of the songs are awesome, but i had to choose my absolute favorite i would pick rise, anywhere with you, and tommorrow too late. if you like this cd check out weezer - 'pinkerton', oasis - 'whats the story morning glory', and the best of blur. good stuff"
2,What a disappointment,"I was looking forward to this cd for a long time. As with all the Saves The Day cds, I bought it without even hearing a song. Their previous efforts are just amazing. But his is such a disappointment. What the heck happened to their sound. Simply put this cd is Stay What You are with VERY few catchy hooks and a very irritating sound. The STD that I loved is quickly becoming a memory. If you are new to Saves The Day, buy Can't Slow Down or Through Being Cool, those are the cds that made STD into the great band that they were. I hope Chris will realize that and go back to those days."
1,bad...,"ok. first of all i love std...i went to high school with chris and he was in my gym class...i loved all of their old stuff, i eventually loved stay what you are...but this new cd...oh man, ok, it's a new sound, think: weezer meets big bird..do you remember the old std shows and how amazing they were...remember chris with short hair..? those were the days...i'm not feeling this cd...i'm leaving it out of my collection... stay what you were."
3,a little heartbreaking,"this is not a saves the day for can't slow down and through being cool fans. if you like stay what you are and nothing else by them, there's a chance this won't disappoint you, but if you're looking for something to rock out to, stick to their older stuff. while there are definitely a few notworthy tracks and though i admit it might grow on me if i give it a few more chances, i miss the saves the day that wowed me from start to finish and kept me hooked no matter how many times i listened."
2,Save The Band??,"I would have to agree with the previous reviewers that compare ""In Reverie"" to a sort of Beatles sounding album. This was definetly not what I was expecting. There are no standout tunes like ""Holly Hox, Forget Me Not"", ""Shoulder To The Wheel"" or ""At Your Funeral"" from previous efforts. The band appeared to be on the verge of big things when they appeared on 1999's Rebirth of Hardcore compilation followed by ""Stay What You Are"", but this effort is sure to alienate more than a few of their fans. Overall a nice effort for maturity in their sound but they lose a few points for abandoing their roots."
2,The Devil's Secret Name,"I really didn't like this book at all. Just filled with a lot of plans that never happened. If he's trying to show us how boring his life has become, he succeeded. I'd give it One Star except I was saving that rating for something really bad. This one is close. He's well traveled, but doesn't seem to find much of interest or happening when he gets there."
3,M Franks the best Album,There are some other M Franks songs that I'd rather have in his the best album.
5,Quintesential Jazz Vocalist,"Michael Franks' silky alto and prolific lyrics make him the quintesential vocalist of the pop- jazz movement. Every song that ever made you love Michael Franks is contained in this CD. Buy it, and enjoy the best this artist has to offer."
4,Smooth Jazz with a twist,"I am a real hater of smooth jazz; in the old days people who hated jazz hated it for it's shronk-fests (think John Coltrane's ""Ascension""), but now the hardcore generation know not of jazz's fire and only of its snooze-fests thanks the popularity of smooth jazz.So why would I give a smooth jazz artist a fairly good rating? The reason is that Franks does create pretty sleepy songs, but the point of his music, unlike many other smooth jazz musicians is to be interestingly lyrical. He doesn't have very cliched song ideas (who would sing about popsicle toes and tigers in the rain?) and that is what makes him memorable. Just like real jazz artists attempt to amaze the audience with their creative improvising, Franks marvels us with his witty and metaphore-rich lyrics. Isn't that what jazz is about, pushing the boundaries? Well done Franks, you have proved that a genre that is so often so boring can have true artists."
3,Missing In Action,"Whenever I see a Greatest Hits with a glaring Omission--""Rainy Night in Tokyo""--I don't ever bother to purchase the collection. Someone obviously doesn't have good taste who made these choices. Leaving off ""Tokyo"" is unforgiveable."
5,Back in the DAY---GOODY,"This CD, is for those people, who love Smooth Jazz--from BACK IN THE DAY/ OLD SCHOOL!!! ALL the songs you sang to,on your favorite SMOOTH JAZZ station and more!!!If you like MICHAEL FRANKS-- ""POPSICLE TOES"" or ""YOUR SECRET's SAFE WITH ME"" or ""WHEN SLY CALLS""------you will LOVE----- EVERYTHING on this CD!!!!This CD is a MUST HAVE--for your MICHAEL FRANKS COLLECTION!!! IT'S A TRUE KEEPER!!!!!"
4,Of course there are more songs you could add...,"but hey, this is Michael Franks we're talking about here, so anyone who has loved his music as long as I have (since ""The Art of Tea"") is gonna be a little picky. But this is as good a place as any to start. Either you'll love him or you'll hate him. Just depends upon your level of intelligence, because you do have to have some to ""get"" Franks. And also a sense of humor wouldn't hurt!"
5,Music for the ages.,"Great Lyrics, great easy listening music and a lifetime of stories make Michael Franks worth listening to over dinner and reflections of the past."
5,Michael Franks Fantastic Music,"I have loved Michael Franks for years. I love his Caribbean soulful music. Great for first date of wine, great food and music that is soft and warm. I think everyone knows him from Popsicle Toes. Do not make music like this anymore; check out Antonio's Song from this album. Wanted this album because of its many hits through the years."
5,His greatest hit in one album,"This is the musican's greatest hits album. Has all of the good songs, including his well-know hits. A must listen!"
4,Valuable resource,"This book had me from the first chapter. If you're looking for a handy, usable companion to writing, this is it. I was looking for fiction writing in particular. Many helpful, original ideas."
3,A Helpful Starting Place,"This book is not, and does not, replace the MFA in Creative Writing. Rather, it offers craft lessons and introduces ideas that the are needed to begin writing the crafted prose or poetry most people except to get from MFA programs. To think that you can replace a multiple year program with one book is, of course, short-sighted. However, this does not mean this book has no advice to those that seek to further their writing; one of the most helpful portions for me was the list of recommended authors. While it is possible to get these recommendations elsewhere, this list gives a good start to those who don't know where to start. In the end, this book is good for those who are starting or just started with writing."
4,MFA Review,"I have not been able to read the entire book, but so far I've gained some good knowledge about writing techniques to use and pitfalls to avoid. I like it very much."
5,Tremendous Resource,"I've read countless books that are intended to improve creative writing, and this may be the best. What makes it different from the rest, is that it's not just theoretical. Instead, along with the theory, there are countless lessons that can be applied immediately, and on a practical level, to one's writing. While the initial foundation of imagination and taste maybe cannot be taught, craft can be, and the lessons within this book are a tremendous place to start. Even the greatest of writers learn how to write as they go along. If you don't believe me, take the time to honestly compare Oliver Twist to David Copperfield or Great Expectations. The differences are practical, and they exist sentence-to-sentence. Even Dickens had to learn how to write. This book would have helped him in his earliest stages."
3,SERIOUSLY: something more easy for a new comer to chess needs to be written,"Whereas, ""THE USCF OFFICIAL RULES OF CHESS"" is written for tournament directors and experienced tournament players to understand, a book for the newcomer to chess is needed that covers:1. Helping the newcomer focus on what is important for practical use in tournament play. The USCF rulebook has so much material it is impossible to know what is important and what is not so important for a tournament player to learn. Help is needed in the massive maze of material!2. Some more detail to explain the meanings of some of the rules in more simple language for the newcomer.3. Are there certain rules that often create problems? What are these rules and how can a player protect his or herself.For a newcomer to chess this book gets 2 stars. For a tournament director or experienced tournament player this book gets 4 stars. Therefore, I figure 3 starts is a fair balance."
3,for referees - not for beginners,from my point of view it's a book for referees - not for players or even beginnersa bit outdated but well structuredbut if you want the newest rules you need to check out the uscf website (that's why only 3 stars)
4,Useful Book,"This book is a very interesting to review. I read it so that I could become a USCF tournament director, but it is still a useful book for anyone interested in chess. It is especially good to glance over if you want to start going to tournaments, but is not necessary. If you are looking for a story or anything of that nature, it is not a book for you."
2,Great deal but a little stale,I bought these bars to keep me from eating things that are worse for me. The price was outstanding... The bars were a little stale. Some boxes more than others. I will tolerate almost anything that won't kill me... so I ate them anyway. But it was definitely noticeable that they weren't fresh as the morning dew.
3,good but not great,"These are good bars, but I prefer the cranberry ginger combination more. The real problem with Nature's Path granola bars is that the quality is inconsistent. At the top of their game, these bars are healthy, nutritious snacks; lately, though, I have purchased several boxes in which the bars were stale and dry, not moist or chewy at all. This is the reason that, although I like these bars, I cannot in good faith recommend them."
5,Yum! And it's good for you too!,"First time trying this and it's delicious! It's super soft and chewy and tastes great. It's almost as good as a rice crispy treat, but it's better for you healthwise. And to top it off, it's organic!One reviewer asked, why add coconut? It's hard to imagine apricot and nut and coconut, but I love it. It's not a strong artificial coconut flavor. It's real, organic coconut. It's subtle and adds a nice smell and taste.I will add a closeup of the nutrition facts in the ""customer images"" link above, right underneath the main image. Make your own educated purchase.I haven't tried the other flavors, but this one's so good, I'll have to try a different flavor next. These are great as breakfast bars."
4,Enjoyable. Needed better editing.,"An overall good book. The story was excellent. A few twists and turns that kept things interesting. I like the fact that the characters were all ""evil"" to one degree or another. Pinch was concerned for his ""friends"" only in terms of them being usefull to him, and his ""friends"" were the same.Definitely could have used some proofreading and editing though. Quite a few spelling, and gramatical errors. Also at one point Pinch goes into some tunnels with an oil lamp and his sword drawn. He then falls down. His candle goes out, and he drops his dagger. Earlier in the book he was in the tunnel with a candle and dagger.Still, if you like D&D; stories, and can find it, it's a good read."
3,"Ok Story, but sloppy writing","The story of pinch and his little band of thieves is reasonably good, but I began to get the feeling the author was being paid on word count and he padded the story by incessant usage of rogue, old rogue, and regulator."
3,Pinch me!,"This novel was very well researched. You can tell that by the extremely thick and heavy usage of the ""Thief talk"". It is paced quite nicely, although some of the ""surprises"" were fairly clear to me. If not for the heavy slang the thieves use this book would have really been great."
2,A beginers treasure/ a yawn for all else,"This book I can see being used to explain storyboarding to the lamin. Unfortunately it was lacking in practical information on shot design, set-up and other information I was looking for. Stay away from this one if your looking for an in-depth tutorial on techniques of storyboarding."
5,The Best Scrapbooking Magazine out there,"Creating Keepsakes is good resource for new as well as long time scrapbookers. They do a nice job of showcasing and reviewing all the new products, and inspire me with fresh ideas. I find myself tearing out favorite examples of layouts and articles that I want to keep. I started saving these in a three ring binder. I've filled two and I've started on my third. I really like how there is now advice in shooting better photos and information on digital scrapbooking."
1,NOT REGULATION SIZE,"If you are looking for a regulation size (or even close) dart board then keep on looking. We were very surprised upon opening this gift that not only was the overall size of the dart board small but all of the target areas as well. For example, the bullseye was 1.5"" smaller than the one we were replacing. Luckily Amazon.com's customer service is second to none and I printed out a return label in minutes. Time to keep looking, just a little late Christmas present."
1,Quit working as soon as it was received,"I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. When he opened it, he was so excited - it was just what he wanted. The lights and sounds were great and he wanted to play. (He's 12 - not destructive, and didn't do anything to ""break"" the board.) His dad immediately went to get materials to hang it on the wall for him. They didn't even get to play one game until the thing quit working. They tried new batteries (even though they had started with new ones), read the entire instruction manual to troubleshoot, etc. Nothing worked. It's a piece of junk. Don't waste your money."
5,Great Deal!,"What I love best is that each individual package of oatmeal is equivalent to two bags of other brands. It's organic and lower in sugar. If you or your kids have a sweet tooth this oatmeal may be a bit bland. I add a wee bit of maple syrup to each serving, otherwise my daughter (age 5) will not eat it."
4,Love the Apple Cinnamon,I bought the variety pack but my favorite is the apple cinnamon. I love cinnamon and the organic oatmeal fills me up with a piece of fruit for breakfast. I work long hours and this keeps me satisfied until lunch. I noticed I am less hungry when lunch time comes around.
3,Good For You But Good?,"Before I begin, let me say that I really like this cereal in the raisin version. The apple version is a bit pasty tasting and I need to add milk to it to make it more palatable. The sweetness level is good (not to sweet) and of course it is healthy."
1,Instant Oatmeal,Product not the same contents as have been purchasing in local co-op for the last two years.
2,"Great product, Cheaper at the health food store",It is WAY too expensive here. I buy this oatmeal brand at the health food store for 2.50 each.6 of them would only be 15 dollars. The product itself is great. Very tasty.
2,Strobe lobed,"A movie with a plot and setting that had potential but which sadly deteriorated into a mini-me version of Dr. No. Tim Curry's evil bad guy character was comical. He belonged in a farce or satire. I think this was supposed to be a serious drama. The ending credits are interspersed with light-hearted quick scenes of the characters in whimsical situations which were supposed to be endearing, I guess. That should give you a clue as to how bad and unintelligent the plot became. Too many flashing lights affects the brain, perhaps."
4,One of her best,"Like every other book I've ready by Agatha Christie - this one is full to the brim with surprises, turns and suspense. Loved it."
2,Far from Endless,"You need to know that this audio book is ABRIDGED. While it's entertaining and well read, this version has only 3 short CDs, each one only about 45 minutes long. The unabridged version read by Hugh Fraser is a far better value."
5,Agatha does it again,"It is really amazing how prolific Agatha Christie was without repeating herself. The woman was a much underrated genius at murder mysteries.This book has a very interesting twist at the end that really smacks you like cold water in the face. I had read this one before, many years ago, so I knew something was coming but couldn't remember the details. It still was a surprise.You can't go wrong reading Christie, and this book is no exception. It isn't one of her better known titles, and of course, has no Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot, but sometimes those books are among her best.I recommend it."
5,Far and away the best of her later books!,"""Endless Night"" was written late in Christie's career (1967), yet it is one of the best things she ever wrote. The murder happens very late in the story, and Christie's ability to surprise her audience, even after fifty years, is as strong as ever. She does re-use old tricks (what magician does not?), but her sheer ingenuity is as evident here as in anything she ever wrote, and there is an atmosphere of evil about this one that Christie was not always able to create. Not to be missed!"
4,Christie classic,"Not my favorite Agatha Christie story, but still a good one. She managed to keep me guessing for most of the novel, always good when you don't figure out who the villain is too soon."
5,One of the best,"I have read every Agatha Christie novel, and rank this book as one of the elite 3 or 4 (Along with Ackroyd, Orient Express, 10 Little Indians). The ending of her novels usually make or break them for me, and the ending to this book was unexpected and superior. This is one of the few books that gave me that ""spine-chilling"" sensation that I wish I experienced during the reading of all mystery novels. Excellent!"
3,Worth Reading,"Endless Night is sort of an interesting Agatha Christie phenomenon. It's not one of her more original mysteries--the major plot devices are borrowed from ""Death on the Nile"" and ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd""--both of which are superior mysteries. However, I maintain that it's well worth reading, if only for the extremely well-done ending. I simply got the chills upon reading it and found it rather tragic, even if one has little sympathy for the murderer. The ending displays the interest by the author in the psychology of her characters also seen in mysteries like ""Sad Cypress"" and ""The Hollow."""
2,It is a book that does not meet the need for a good read,The book starts really slow and gets slower.I realy like Agatha Christie but this was at the end of her lifeSo She just wasn't up to snuff.
3,Later work from A .C,Dame Agatha has used here the same plot-formula as she used in her earlier book Three Blind Mices and Other Stories (one of those stories). The plot was exactly the same and as twisted and fooling. The whole athmosphere in the world of this book is somehow hopeless and depressing. I'd rather recommend you a truly masterpiece of A.C's many books TOWARDS ZERO. It was written in 1944 and in my opinion 40's was the golden era for Christie. Towards Zero is a story about what can happen with a twisted human mind. Extremely well written thriller...
2,Hmmm.... dissappointing,"This book looks interesting, but I 'd rather say I was dissappointed, having read almost all Christie's books.Get it only if you plan to collect every Agatha book. If you are a newbie in the Christie world or you want only the tops, this isn't for you."
1,This is one of Mrs Christie's worst books,"I do not really understand how could all of the reviewers recommend this book. I did not think it was that good it was rather slow and sorry to say boring.If you have read many books by Agatha Christie and want to read this book go ahead but you might not like because it is not so thrilling.If you really want to read some good stuff by Mrs Christie go for ""The Secret adversery"" a tommy and Tuppence mystery it is not really bad and you might like it.If you want to read good mysteries I would recommend Georges Simenon's Maigret's Novels they are really good and M. Simenon is big time better than Mrs Christie (sorry to say that but try and see)"
5,A Masterpiece,"You must read this book. It is completely unlike any of her other mysteries and will haunt you for days afterwards. It made me reflect about myself like no other novel I've ever read. If you thought Agatha Christie was already a great author before, just wait until you read this."
1,A complete waste of time,"This is the first time I have reviewed a book for Amazon. I am doing this because I consider this book to be 100% garbage.If you are looking for a book full of annoying cross references (i.e. see page 118; see page 73) and for a book which repeats the same quotes or phrases in different chapters (was there really no editor?) BUY THIS BOOK.Also, if you are looking for cheap tid-bits and trivia about the US women's soccer team (was it really necessary to write three times about one female ripping her shirt off after a goal?) BUT THIS BOOK.If you want to have a general overview about the rules of Soccer but want nothing of strategy, technique, training, then BUY THIS BOOK. (or why not just go to the FIFA website and download the same rules which make up 50% of this book)But if you want to learn how to play or coach soccer, forget it. This book is a COMPLETE waste of time."
5,Soccer for Dummies,Helped a lot apsects of the game.I need more words to complete this review so I'm just adding until it lets me submit
2,Not very good.,"This book isn't particularly good for anything. It covers many aspects of the sport, but doesn't do any one aspect justice. I was especially unhappy with the the rules section. And who could forget Brandi Chastain ripping off her jersey after the penalty kick . . . ."
3,"Larger than expected, but they work!","These ""Pig Size"" hog rings are a bit larger than I expected...I would hate to see what the ""hog"" size would look like. :-) Although the size caught me off guard, these worked perfected for my usage, attaching a seat cover to a bench seat frame. Worked great, great price and quite a few per box."
4,Good CD,"This a pretty good album. My favorite songs from the album are Candy and San Francisco. The last song is a bit long for me. I agree with the other reviewer that each song sounds different. Some songs are real rockers and others are mellow. I like the lyrics and the Bass lines. I like this album, and cannot wait for another release by Stegosaurus."
5,Hidden Treasure,"Overall this CD is pretty good. The last track on the CD, ""Treasure,"" is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I would buy this CD just for this song and listen on repeat for days."
4,different,"These guys are really quite unique. I can't really describe them in comparison to other groups. They are rhythmic and melodious at the same time. Try listening to the thumbnails, it helps. Sorry I can't be of any more help."
4,Jim Reeves life video,"I ordered what I thought was a book on Jim Reeves life and I got a video of his life. Nevertheless the video was well done and featured his biggest song He'll Have To Go several times in the movie on Jim Reeves life. Like all life stories, they usually try to cover too much ground in so little of a time. But basically it covers all the high points and generally it was a good flick... I've watched it about three times since purchasing it."
2,Unrealistic characters,"Mickey's father was a championship pool player before he died, back when Mickey was a baby. Now that Mickey is eleven, he is determined to follow in his father's footsteps, starting by beating the local bully in the town's big children's pool tournament. When an old friend of his father's walks back into their lives and offers to coach him, Mickey is thrilled. His mother, though, isn't quite so enthusiastic.The story is decent, although a bit cliche. It is obvious what will happen with all of the conflicts; there isn't a whole lot of tension. I didn't really like any of the characters in this story. I thought Mickey was really whiny, and he and his friend acted much younger than fifth grade. It seemed they were always screaming something, and I found that irritating."
5,Explains that English is more than just words in a dictionary,"I checked this book out of a library to do a report and found a wealth of information on communication, culture, the history of English and how languages change over time."
5,ADORABLE!!!,I gave this as a gift to a newborn - along with the book 'Poodlena' (because Gigi looks like Poodlena) - what an adorable set they make!!! And Gigi looks perfectly safe for a small child's room (at the newborn stage I expect she will simply be on a display for a while and Gigi is perfect for that - with the big pink head and red nails)
4,These are a fun read...,"Haakon's not your typical viking. These books are pretty cheesy. Kind of like a ""B"" movie or a pulp western with a viking theme. I enjoyed them a lot, but they're not significant literary contributions to the genre.The premise of the series is that Haakon is given this golden ax by Thor, and its magic guides him in situations where there's a moral conflict. Not really congruent with the whole viking concept.Nevertheless, they're not that hard to find, and as noted in the title, a quick and fun read."
3,Just one drawback,"... the belt clip is not that secure; in fact, just getting out of the car it popped off my waist band a few times. The case is compact and seems to reasonably protect the camera. However, when using the cam, i leave the case at home; I just pop the camera (G400, 4 mp) in my shirt pocket, and put the cord around my neck.This is a whole lot quicker to access than from the case."
4,4 1/2 STARS: A NEAR PERFECT MASTERPIECE,"I first heard this cd by Los Amigos Invisibles at work thanksto my boss. It really caught me by surprise. Great dance music fromVenezuela of all places! It is very funky and very beautiful. 1 reviewer called "" Mi Linda"" a cross between Armand van Helden and Gipsy Kings. How about adding some Daft Punk to it? ""Mi Linda"" is a classic and I wish the track was longer. ""El Disco Anal"" is also very danceable. ""Cachete a Cachete"" echoes Steely Dan. It sounds as if Don Fagen and Walter Becker teamed up with Los Amigos: a gorgeous jazzy tune. Why am I giving this cd 4 1/2 stars? I started to enjoy everything here until ""Balada de Chusy"" which hits a sour note. Skip the track and enjoy ""The New Sound Of The Venezuela Gozadera"". I will still place this in my Top 10 best of 2000. This is a great discovery! Great cover photo-oh so '60s! Why can't the variety shows of Univision, Telemundo or Galavision promote a sensational group like this?"
4,Proud to be Venezuelan,"Few Venezuelan have got international fame. Desorden Publico and international projects with Venezuelan members (King Chango, Dogon), have got this internationalization. But none of them have gone as far as Los Amigos Invisibles. Knavery and humor is the constant sign here, while music is full of lounge, 70's disco, caribean rhythms, trip-hop, etc. ""The New Sound of The Venezuelan Gozadera"" is not a record to take seriously. And if you have the posibility to see them live, then go. You will not appreciate their talent more trully and fully than here."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I saw Los Amigos Invisibles on David Byrne's Sessions at West 54th and was very impressed with the energy and talent of the group. I couldn't get enough of their music. However, for me, the CD fails to capture the energy and spontaneity of the live performance. Also, I felt the keyboards and sampling on the album bordered on overkill. Nevertheless, if you enjoy funky dance music, there are enough tracks on this disc to satisfy."
5,"Dope music, even better live performance","These guys were introduced to me through a Venezuelan friend of mine and I am still grateful to him.. The CD is really well-mixed, although I don't speak any spanish at all I still listen to it everyday.. If you get an opportunity to see them live, you cannot miss it.. They have a really good stage performance which unites you with the band and their music.. I will not be the least-bit surprised when these dudes make it really big in the coming years.."
2,Authenticity,"As a former student of Ms. Morris, I will state that she and William Morris were quite emphatic about keeping the teachings sacred and authentic as taught by Grand Master Takata. Her history is to this day accurate."
1,If I only had known,"If I had known, I wouldn't have purchased this book. The only good thing I found were the pictures of the Masters and diagrams of hand positions. There are better books on Reiki than this one."
5,The BEST in phonics,In 30 years of using this system to help children learn to read I have never found another as effective as this one. Not even close. These EPS readers and workbooks introduce phonics concepts in graduated steps. The progression is logical and truly consistent with plenty of practice. This third set of readers and the workbook that goes with it introduce blends and consonant digraphs. That allows for a more creative vocabulary than the first two sets of readers use and the children really enjoy the stories.
4,Best Ending Ever!,"This is a very funny movie, although pretty crude and difficult to watch in parts but what really makes it worth watching is the ending. I don't want to ruin it for people so go check it out yourselves!"
1,Most boring so-called comedy,"This is British 'comedy' at its worst! I was hoping to see a movie about a guy (as the title suggests) that would make Al Bundy look like a saint, alas I was in for a rude shock... this movie is so mundane that after watching it you'll probably do what I did...throw it away!"
3,Heavy-Handed,"This is a competent performance that respects the spirit of these wonderful pieces, but the playing, especially in the more lighthearted sections, is just too heavy-handed, and the keyboard runs are sometimes muddy and insufficiently articulated. I'm unfamiliar with most versions, but there seem to be a number of pianists on record who I know can muster a lighter touch. I own a version by Jorg Demus I acquired quite a while back that I still find satisfying."
5,Laid Back Blythe,"Ever since hearing ""Lenox Avenue Breakdown"" I have been a Arthur Blythe fan.This recording represents his introspective side . You might think that a collection of duets with cello player David Eyges might be dry. But not so. It has a very loose freeform feel, and really shows the contemplative take on his playing."
3,Another personal experience publication,"The title is misleading, but the content is entertaining nonetheless. It appears to accurately portray the experiences ofa young man who lived with the plains Indians for a while,did some scouting and trapping, etc."
5,The white Indian Boy: The Story of Uncle Nicke Among the Shoshones,"I ordered several copies of this book from Amazon.com to give to my grown children to read to their children. This book (story) has been rather special to our family since we lived in Jackson Hole, WY, read the book for the first time, met some of Nick Wilson's family and visited his grave. It is quite the adventure and has become a family favorite."
4,Excellent Overview of Media Ethics,"I am a University student studying Public Relations, and I found this book to be very informative and interesting. It also increased my knowledge of communication theories by outlining the different theories and explaning their premises. This was both a review and avenue to increase my knowledge. And the book took it one step further by expounding upon the theories and providing real-life case studies.These cases were not only interesting; they also brought the theories to life by providing practical application. As a future Public Relations professional who will deal with these issues, I found the case studies to be very helpful.I would recommend this book to anyone looking to futher their knowledge of ethics and the media. It is great for communications students, as well as anyone who deals with ethics issues in the workplace. (That should encompass pretty much everyone!)"
4,Media Ethics,"Patterson and Wilkin's book contains moral dilemmas relevant to basically any field of communications and media studies (public relations, journalism, photojournalism, advertising, you name it). As a university student planning on entering the media world, I have been given a preview at what kinds of issues will undoubtedly surface throughout my career and has helped me to strengthen my moral discernment.The book applies theories to modern-day concerns that affect everyone, but without giving a definitive right or wrong answer"
5,An excellent and practical manual on how to handle anyone.,"I found this book (audiotape)to be an excellent and very practical manual on how to handle both difficult people in everyday situations as well as everyday people in difficult situations. What is really good about this book is that it gives the exact sentences, words, and phrases to use in various situations. It provides an actual script for what needs to be said when coping with difficult people."
3,In Business maybe but not in Life!,"I feel that this audio cd's claim that ""Coping with Difficult People: In Business and in Life"" was false advertising. If you're looking for how to deal with difficult people in the business world, than this cd would be of help. However, if you're looking for how to deal with difficult people in a personal setting such as difficult friends, family members, etc., beware you won't find it in this cd. Since I was looking for help in dealing with how to deal with difficult relationships in my personal life, I was very much disappointed and let down that it did not cover this area as it claimed."
5,Worthwhile,I found a lot of information in this book that I could put to use. I'd recommend it to others. Not a book that will out date anytime soon.
4,Good coping strategies,"I thought the parts of this book that described some of the different, difficult personalities was very good. I actually really thought it had something to offer and the strategies were practical. The insights though didn't stick and I think that you have to read this regularly to keep reminding yourself that all these people exist in the world (including you) and you are going to see them every day. Thats kind of a depressing thought actually. With all the other books I need to keep reading to remind myself about various insights I want to stay home."
5,Dealing With Difficult People,"Read about the different types of people in the world today, and find out ways to deal with difficult personalities."
5,LOVE THIS SET,"We Love this set. My mom got this for my son for Christmas and he loves it! He loves the fact that he can pretend he is a space ranger (like in Buzz Lightyear). I like it because the whole set is 100% cotton. My son is a ""sweat""er and the other Bob the Builder set he had was polyester and he was soaked every night from sweat. This set breathes the way a good sheet set should. I also like this set because it is not the typical licensed sheetset that gets those little balls on it after a few washes.All in all, a great set!"
4,Good,"Once again, Jando does a good job with these piano sonatas. On my CD (evidently different from the one shown here), the first two movements of both the ""Waldstein"" and ""Les Adieux"" sonatas are combined onto one track. That is a negative feature to me. This is not my favorite recording of the ""Waldstein,"" but it is good. The price is a bonus for this CD. The CD was recorded in 1987, and the sound quality is fairly good."
4,Good knife for the price,"It is a good value for the price. The knife has a plastic handle and a very sharp stainless steel blade. The weight of it is a little light for my taste, and I wish it had a locking blade but otherwise a useful item to have at hand."
1,half truths by Bosco,Mr. Bosco has evidence that can clear Bill Fontanille but will not release this information unless he (Bosco) can profit financially from this information. Bosco claims to be an author one day than a journalist the next. What are you Joe Bosco? Journalist strive for truth. You have let an innocent man sit in prison because of your greed.
4,COWBOY BALLADS,DON EDWARDS HAS A VOICE THAT YOU WILL NOT SOON FORGET. IF YOU LOVE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG BY PURCHASING THIS ALBUM.
4,What it should be,"Got these as a xmas present for my sister, along with the Goldfinch and the Chickadee, and she loved them - attractive and good quality. Delivery and billing were unproblematic."
1,Bought as a gift - she loved it,I had to find a cardinal gift for a friend as she loves the birds.This site was the only site I was able to find the Cardinal.It's very nice and she loved it too.
4,A MUST READ,"I heartily enjoyed the story and the two main characters. Payton and Conner are a great match. My only complaint is that Conner didn't seem to have a lot emotions in the book. He came across as very robotic with his thoughts toward Payton. She obviously wore her heart for him on her sleeve, but as for him - I didn't see much evidence of a heart throughout the book. All in all, I still recommend the book. I think I could skip seeing her brothers in a book of their own. I don't believe her boorish hillbilly brothers deserve a book of their own."
3,WHAT'STHE BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS BOOK!,"I have about three chapters left to read in this book and I still don't see the magic. The plot is just too slow and the hero and heroine seem flat. The only interesting characters in this book are the heroine's three older brothers, who happen to be very funny in their outrageous antics. Next time when I am at the bookstore I do not think that I will even glance at Ms. Cabot's section."
4,"A GREAT, QUICK READ","I finished this book in one night. It is filled with witty, sparkling diaglog, HUMOR, a spunky heroine, a hunky hero and plenty of lively secondary characters. The action never stops. The love making is hot. This was my first Patricia Cabot book, but it will not be my last. Good read. Highly recommended."
4,Fun and intriguing..but read the first book first!,"Just to set things straight- ""The Wooden Spaceships"" is the 2nd in a trilogy all of which were indeed published in the late 1980s. The first volume is ""The Ragged Astronauts"" which introduces Toller, his planet Land and the growing problem that leads to the great migration to Overland. The 3rd book is ""The Fugitive Worlds"" whose main character is one of Toller's descendants returning to see what has become of Land and Overland."
4,Primitive men travel between two closely orbiting planets.,"A diamond in the rough. Two planets are in such a close orbit that their atmospheres touch and men in ""wooden spaceships"" travel from one planet to the other. Supposed to be the first in a series of three books. The second was published as ""Ragged Astronauts"". This reviewer never found the third book in the series"
3,This is an OK item,Was expecting more out of it. Doesn't hold properly when full of toys. But keeps my daughter busy in her bath.
3,Hard to rate,"This is the first FATA CD I bought, and at first, it rocked my ass. They ARE doing something truly original, and I think that's what first caught my eye. However, i just can't take Fran's voice for extended periods of time. I don't mind screamo, but his voice grates my poor little ears after a while. Musically, this is a very small step down from their first CD TBYB. But still, the music rocks, Ben rocks (when they let him sing, err...scream.), and the lyrics are very well written. Talented songwriting for sure. And for those reasons, I do recommend this CD."
3,A tad disappointing,"Wow this cd starts off with a great song, The After Dinner Payback, and then totally loses its momentum. The first song reminded me a lot of FATA's older stuff, but then it just lost all of its agression. I guess if you like ""emo"" better than ""screamo"" you'd probably like this better than their older stuff, but I don't know...it's just not quite as fullfilling. After listening to it, just makes me want to go listen to Poison the Well."
4,Not bad but falls into a sophmore slump,"The new FATA cd is good, really good,but so was the first one, the new cd sounds almost like they were rushed to make it. Some of the lyrics sound like canned emo, like they tried to say things that sound sad but they just come off as sounding cliche. The music itself is great, and the vocals are amazing. If it werent for the lack of lyrical content this cd would have got 5 stars. We still hear the same aggresive screamo style on most of the songs, the band has showed a little progress however delving into slower lighter (more singing, less screaming) songs, this is a good thing, the blend of hard and mellow makes for a great listen that doesnt get boring."
1,Irritating And Mudane Emocore,"From Autumn to Ashes had something going for them in their earlier years, a fresh, new emo influenced hardcore band. Wow, it amazes me to see that such a band has dumbed down to this mindless and worthless emo band. Granted, i have a great disdain for emo, but that aside they still could have had something, but instead 'Friction We Live' became a heavier Thrusday record. With the cliched lyrics about life and such, perhaps the worst singer and screamer in this genre, and mindnumbingly dull and soft riffs, 'Friction We Live' is unsalvangable; nearly to the point of destruction. I thought that these guys grew up, stopped complaining about life, and were going to focus on making some, at lest slightly, heavy music. But it did come out at a good time, with excellent releases by As I Lay Dying, Nora, and Burst (all with emo influences), there is something to fall back onto. From Autumn to Ashes, please, get heavier, and then maybe you won't sound so da mn pathetic!"
2,major disapointment....,"From Autumn to Ashes last cd, Too Bad You're Beautiful is amazing. Because of that, I went out and purchased Fiction We Live the day it came out. Gone on this cd are the longer songs and craziness that made Too Bad You're Beautiful so good. Instead, the drummer sings much more, creating a Linkin Park feel. Spin or Rolling Stone even said they were emo's anwser to Linkin Park. The guitars seem to be much more simplier on this cd also. Download The After Dinner Playpack and forget the rest of this cd. There are much better albums in this genre, such as Poison the Well - Opposite of December, anything by Dillinger Escape Plan, and Everytime I Die - Hot Damn!"
4,FATA changed in good ways and in bad,"FATA is a great band their debut album of ""Too Bad You're Beatiful"" is a great debut with songs like ""Short Stories With Tragic Endings"", ""Take Her To The Music Store"" and more but in this album they went more melodic and gave more chance to Fran (drummer) to sing more I kinda think his voice is annoying in this album though cause in their debut album was all the time lead and some parts back up now in this one i think they switched putting more emoish to this stuff it's ok but it could be way better"
3,"Solid, but just not QUITE reaching their potential...","First off, I really enjoy this album. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is the unceasing WHINNING of the second vocalist. The growls and screams are wonderful, the guitar work is solid. I enjoy the drumming and how the double-kicks are placed. I just can't let the other vocals slide. However, I personally think this album is tighter then Too Bad You're Beautiful. More artful, tasteful, and musically diverse. My favorite songs are The After Dinner Payback and Every Reason To."
2,quickly forgotten,"the first album was amazing, and i was looking forward to the release of this album. when i got it, i was disappointed. i don't think it begins to compare with 'too bad you're beautiful.' i have heard many bands of this style of music go from smaller labels to bigger ones, and they have done a much better job with keeping material consistent. i think the guitar line up changes are part of the reason, however it seems as if the songwriting on the whole isn't as well thought out. gone the dynamic, replaced by a more typical hardcore sound. had this been their only material, i don't think i would have pursued listening to from autumn to ashes."
1,What happened?,"I must admit - i'm not the biggest fan of hardcore, but when something strikes me that I like, I usually take the time to listen. FATA's first full lenght release showed a lot of promise; a nearly perfect album (except for 3 tracks, which i ommited when burning te CD). This sounds nothing like what I had visioned their follow-up to sound like. I blame the evil folk over at Vagrant records for this. I'm 100% for bands to progress, but this just isn't a natural progression at all. I hoped for more norwegian-inspired hardcore, but instead tey opted to go the ""emo"" route. Much like the newest Cave-In release, radio-friendly harcore is now being fed to the masses."
1,Lodge,"FATA is dead. This CD is horrible compared to their previous, go buy it and leave this one alone. My god what happened to the vocals..."
2,Too Bad You're Not Beautiful Anymore,"I had been anticipating this album when i heard about it a couple weeks ago. i had also heard the after dinner payback from the freddy vs. jason soundtrack. it wasn't the same FATA but i could sorta groove to it. Out of this whole cd i found two decent songs which are The after dinner payback and Every reason too and one song with a good ending which is alive and out of habit. However i did like the fact that that one broad from the last cd came back and did some vocals for the autumns monologue which is a good song if you just like the soft stuff.When it all comes down to it, i could hear this stuff on the radio. This is not the FATA i used to know. you want good FATA? go to your local music store and get Too Bad You're Beautiful.."
4,"Don't believe the haters, this is a good CD","I first heard of FATA when they opened for Shadows Fall a few years ago. At first, I was not a fan of their music, but I decided to blindly pickup this CD and I am now hooked on their brand of emometalcore.Yes, this disc is not ""Too Bad You're Beautiful"" part deux, but instead, it seems like FATA are now trying to write more groove-oriented songs with more chugga-chugga riffage. Yeah, they can go from brutal death metal to melodic emo at the drop of a black emo-style baseball cap, but if you get this band and enjoy their music, this is a good CD for your collection.TFWL has plenty of good riffs, a nice mix of melody and brutality, and it portrays the overall talent, originality, and chops of the band. I'm just not a fan of ""Autumn's Monologue"" because it sounds like it belongs on a Sarah McClachlan CD, but other than that, the boys from LI bring the rock and don't stop."
3,one really long song,Decent listen but Im not a fan of it...Or maybe elements of it. Every song seems to be in the same key with the same renditions of screaming being layered with whiny vocals which leads to 10 of 11 tracks sounding like one 40 minute song; the only break coming on track seven when Melanie from 'One True Thing' takes the mic (even this seems out of place). The lighter songs that are solely sung by the drummer are tired and uninteresting for the most part. The whole screamo epidemic is becoming so cliche that my stomach is starting to turn. Every band these days seems to concentrate these complicated transitions from heavy riffing/screaming immediately into to clean melodic guitar lines/singing. The lead singer seems to be an afterthought in most of these songs as the backup singing drummer is taking the lead in most tracks which shows the influence that Vagrant Records has taken to this group. The layout on the cd is way cool.....
3,"Not horrible, not great.","1) The whiny singer needs to not sing anymore. In hardcore you either scream or you sing. This guy can't really do either one it seems. There are hardcore bands where the vocalist can do them both (Boy Sets Fire, etc.) but this guy can't. He sounds very whiny and that coupled with the cheesy lyrics (sound like highschool love notes/poetry sometimes) is not a good combo. That's the beauty of hardcore--even if the lyrics are bad, you can't always understand them so they don't get in the way...no so with this FATA.2) The songs DO ROCK. They've done their metal homework and you'll hear incfluences from ""Master of Puppets""-era Metallica to Iron Maiden.3) The song with the female vocalist (Meg-whatshername, right?) is great."
2,Not as good as Too Bad,"This one is much different than the first album as the drummer sings a helluva lot more. Which i guess is cool if you dig his singing, but i don't. I mean it's okay, but Ben barely sings in this one, i don't even see whats the point of haing a guy in the band who screams one line each song. Milligram smile is probably the only good song on here, as ben does a decent amount of screaming. Don't buy this expecting another too bad your beautiful, this one is pretty different, so to sum it up ....it sucks."
2,FATA fails in this release,"Ok. I totally disagree with everyone else on this CD. I really enjoyed ""Too Bad You're Beautiful"" but this CD is awful. FATA have completely neglected their hardcore roots in favor of a more emo influenced sound. This alone is not enough to make me hate this cd, however. The screaming is almost completely phased out, and when you do hear it, it is weak and obvious the guy can't keep up with the band. As for thew singing vocals, I liked them before in the 1st cd, because they were intelligently used and not overdone. This time around they are in the majority of every song. And he has absolutely no range. Every line he sings sounds the same. As for the music it's self. It is not impressive. It is overeaching and at times extremely annoying. Bottom line"" This CD is very lack lustre and a huge dissapointment. The best song is track 7 where the girl from ONe True Thing is the only one singing. She is pretty great."
1,This album should be non-fiction.,"I have no idea why this album has received such great reviews from everyone on here. After their first album (which rocked to no end) I was anxious to hear this one. The first song is awesome, the rest of the album contributes to my saying that this is the worst metal album I have ever heard. The drummers voice makes me wanna grab a cane and pull him off the stage like Daffy Duck. This record made me feel metal in a way I never have before. It actually made me dislike the genre while I listened to the horror fill my eardrums. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE! I don't get why anyone would post this album as any good. I do not know of one person who said it was good except for here. WORST ALBUM OF ALL TIME!-DirtyJimmy"
2,Great story - terrible edition,"This is indeed a ripping yarn, but the ADVENTURES OF LOUIS DE ROUGEMONT has been mangled by the publisher, ""Quill Pen Classics"".Everything meant to be italicized from the original text appears here with an underscore before and after each word. The text is ugly to look at and appears to be poorly mimeographed.I won't be ordering any more books from this publisher and I'd warn away anyone else. Find another edition somewhere else. Hopefully another publisher can do this fascinating (if untrue) story it's justice in print. It's in the public domain, after all (which is probably why it's been so shamefully reproduced here)."
4,"Pretty good! Fun, clear, easy to read, loved his sarcasm.","I really liked it. Meyer doesn't take the movies too seriously -they're just movies for God's sake! I happen to hate the scholastic approach, so his style is quite refreshing.He managed to communicate what's important and essential about the films whitout boring me to death. Yes, it's subjective, but that's the way art is perceived, and that's the way it should be reviewed --never trusted those critics that seem to know ""too much""-.He made me feel like watching more of the genre, that's good, right?"
2,"Pretentious, neither scholarly nor a compleat video guide.","Despite beautiful cover, excellent photos & lobby cards, a fairly accurate intro, Meyer deserts us as a writer and perceptive analyst. Each entry begins with totally confusing and meaningless drawings, a silly ""mood guide"" and then some of the poorest analyses one could over read marred by such trashy expressions as ""f**k-ups and f**king up,"" ""metaphorical crap"" and ""boppy,"" to name a few. He does provide some very good indexes, but NO VIDEO INFORMATION for each entry. Eg. GUN CRAZY should have CBS/FOX Video, No. 7337 VHS.Greatest sin is Meyer's attitudes towards noir and its creators. For example, his comments about Orson Welles re: TOUCH OF EVIL. To comment on the latter's girth and ""self-hatred"" has nothing to do with Welles' genius. The entire ms. is sprinkled with these kind of trashy, personal speculations which detract from the entire work.Mostly, it is NOT a complete video guide to film noir."
5,Mystery with a twist,"Jane Langton is, simply, excellent. This book is a departure for Langton - it takes place partly in present time, with Homer and Mary Kelly trying to track down the story of one of her ancestors, a presumed Civil War deserter. At the same time we read the real story as it happened almost 150 years ago. In the end, Homer and Mary almost get it right. A great read, whether you're a Civil War buff or not."
1,These bootlaces are crap!,I used them for one day and one of the laces already broke. I would avoid these laces if possible.
5,Can be bought new for $35 at National Motorists Assoc. Web,Excellent reading for those who suffer on America's HWY systems.How things could be if we didn't coddle the incompetent!
2,Back Cover,"Kate was finished with love for good. Kate's new boss, features editor Eliot Holman, might have devastating charms-but Kate couldn't care less, even if it was obvious that he was interested in her. Everyone, including Eliot, thought Kate was grieving over the loss of her husband, Toby. She kept it a carefully guarded secret just how cruelly Toby had treated her and how terrified she was of trusting men again. But Eliot refused to leave her alone, which only served to infuriate her. He was no different from any other man...or was he?"
3,Man's World,I really didn't like the book the book that much because the heroine seemed to be a feminist.
4,reading and understanding research,The text has been used for the past several terms in the class I'm teaching. It is an interesting read.
5,"Awesome on Windows, does not work on MAC Intel (only PPC)","This is an amazing game, and i played frequently played the windows version when i was using Windows. However, the Mac version does not work on Intel Macs, only the old PPC processor."
3,Age of Empires II,"This particular CD has glitches in the software, to where sometimes it's missing functions. Otherwise a standard and straightforward game."
5,AMAZING !,"The best of the best on strategic's game. I wanna try with the AoE III, but this.... is everything."
4,Old School,"For all of us that just don't like the newer Age of Empires this is the game that we fell in love with. In depth gameplay but not too hard so anyone could learn to play. I feel the problem with a lot of these types of games is that they outsmart their own intended audience. This is not the case for AOE 2, great strategy game!"
4,I love this game...,I used to have it but lost the copy so bought new. I just bought AOE III as well.
4,"Good overview, but not the best possible track selection","Like the ""Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues"" volume dedicated to Son House, this CD includes songs from House's entire career. That's a big plus, and this is great music, but I would still recommend the ""Martin Scorsese Presents The Blues"" album, which has a stronger track list.This CD includes several of Son House's most legendary songs, including the superb early-40s Library of Congress version of ""Walking Blues"", the a capella spiritual ""John The Revelator"", and the awesome ""Death Letter"". But it misses out on key tracks like ""Levee Camp Moan"", ""Preachin' Blues"", and the slide guitar-fest ""Pearline"", and even though no Son House-collection can merit less than four stars, this is not one of the best."
5,New to Son House? This is the place to start...,"Eddie 'Son' House was one of the most intense and commanding of the early Mississippi Delta bluesmen, and he was also one of the greatest. This 'best of' collection wonderfully captures glimpses of the three major periods of House's career: his debut 1930 Paramount session, his early 1940s field recordings made by Alan Lomax and his rediscovery in the 1960s. With informative notes by Mark Humphrey and Robert Crumb's distinctive cover artwork, the set is a loving tribute to one of the genre's greatest and most powerful voices."
3,Son House,"I was listening to the samples online and wanted to buy some Son House. There were no samples for this album, so I took a chance on it. I ended up returning it as I was not that impressed with it. If you want some really good Son House, then buy the Original Delta Blues album. I am partial to Delta Blues anyway."
1,Great collection but horrible sound.,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This cd had the potential of being an excellent introduction to Lavoe's work. However, the sound is so bad that it makes my old Fania tapes sound like audiophile material. There is no excuse to charge this amount of money for inferior product. Wait for Emusica's new Fania reissues. Although those guys aren't perfect either, I'm sure they will justice to Lavoe's work."
1,"Will always be the best, but.....","...This CD has very good songs of my great idol of the salsa music, the motive by which I am giving this ranking is because the songs do not be complete. Sorry!!"
3,ok for the price,"these are pretty basic, and acrylic (not my favorite) but they came in time for Christmas and completed our Team Zissou look, so yeah, they're alright."
4,TIGHT!,"this thing is like a boa-constrictor. it attempts to crush your head with its massive elastic nature. other than that it's red and a beanie, which is what i wanted"
2,Chineese made junk,This unit is made in China.The manufacturer will not send parts to repair... The unit must be sent in.If anything breaks it becomes a disposable unit..Worked great for one year of light use...Stopped moving after one season... Was not feasable to ship unit back and forth for repair.No parts available from Smart Pools..I tossed it out after one year use..Buy somthing that has more product support...Hope this helps..
3,"After reading this book, you'll want to build a boat.","When I first received the book, it looked like a text book. Within the first two chapters though, I was hooked. Mr. Pollard coveys a vast amount of information in a very easy reading style. I wish all ""how to"" books were as easy to read and understand."
2,"while the information could be good, the delivery was boring","While the intention of this video is well founded and the director's goal worthy, the editorial and creative process was seriously lacking on the production end of this DVD.Basically, the DVD contains mostly Puppy Kindergarten Classes. The DVD has little to no editorial structure and specifically lacks any true ""on camera"" segments that address the viewer. While this method could be valid for some viewers for me I found it very tiring and not worth watching.There are other videos out there that offer information on Puppy training. I would choose them over this one unless you don't mind sitting through this type of format.-----Perhaps the value of this DVD would be to introduce a viewer to what it might be like to take your dog to this particular trainer's puppy kindergarten class. But in this case it should be offered as part of her service and not on Amazon."
3,A Mixed Marriage,We have the original 1967 cassette of this weirdly wonderful medley. The playing of Marie-Claire Alain on the superb grand organ of Meaux Cathedral is excellent in every way and some of the tracks are for organ alone. The 11 strong natural(?) hunting horn ensemble (Rallye Louverts de Paris) is a very different matter. I defy anyone to listen without guffawing out loud. Playing alone the sound is somewhere between out-of-door hunting horns & giant kazoos. The greatest joy is where the well-tempered organ and the drunkenly ill-tempered horns play together. Those who have perfect pitch will suffer. We wouldn't part with it. Enjoy!!!
2,Very disappointing,"This fixture arrived quickly, and there were no problems with the installation. However, and this is a big however, the glass of the bowl is so thin that not only are the light bulbs absolutely apparent but the bulb sockets are as well. In no way does this light, when installed and lit, look like the picture on the Amazon page. And now, of course, I have the choice of putting up with it or getting the electrician back here to disassemble the light, repackage it, and in the meantime have no light in the bathroom. A most disappointing product."
2,Frustrating to learn to navigate,"But worth it if you manage to master the program. It just takes a little time and patience. I read the positive reviews on this product, and ""Solved 2005"" could be a wonderful asset to those of us trying to learn or brush up on our math skills. However, I found the program very frustrating and confusing to navigate. There is no written manual - the information is on line. That means every time something isn't working, or I need to look up what to do, I have to leave the problem I'm working on and surf the program to try and find my answer.I have to admit, when I contacted Bagatrix for help, they responded with answers, but again, having to do this takes time away from study time and I shouldn't have to keep contacting them with questions about their program."
1,Where's the beef?,"This book really let me down and I get the feeling it was written by a none technical person. Would have liked more information, body or content to really make it worth while buying it.In terms of spam books, there are very few, if I was to recommend a better title I would say : Inside the Spam Cartel, by Syngress. It had much more body and content and I didn't feel `empty' when I finished it.No disrespect to the author, but I finished the book and still felt hungry for information."
1,spammers are criminals,"McWilliams well applies the craft of investigative journalism to hissubject, fleshing outthe shady characters who send the spam as well as the frustrated vigilantes whoattempt to shut them down.One great moment in the book is when a coalition of spam senders who have suedan anti-spamming organization to get them to cease their efforts abandon theirlegal efforts when the anti-spamming organization begins to use the process oflegal discovery to determine the identities of the companies bringingthe lawsuit.Another is the line, ""You couldn't find your ass with a search warrant.""Lacking in technological detail -- a brief discussion of the differentmoods of the differentreal-time black list services is as geeky as this book gets:discussion of the meritsof statistical filering, whitelisting, and sender-pays schemes isnotably absent -- SpamKings is a solid introduction to the realities of Spam in the presentmoment, from a human and legal perspective."
4,A look at what goes on behind the spam,"Spam is no longer a nuisance. It has developed into a huge problem for organizations that have to deal with the millions of e-mails that flood their mailboxes, often delivering scams or viruses.It has gotten to the point that more than 60 percent of today's e-mail traffic is spam. And experts estimate that more than five trillion spam messages will be sent in 2005. Such volumes of e-mail result in lost productivity, system downtime, employee frustration, and a host of other problems.It is an axiom in security to know your enemy. Before taking on spammers, Spam Kings is a good place to turn for a look at some of the people responsible for the spam epidemic. The book provides the details, often comical, of the seemingly never-ending cat-and-mouse games played by spammers and members of the antispam cabal dedicated to stopping them. It's a good preview on what a company is getting into when it decides to take on spam."
5,Excellent,"This is one of the absolute best interpretations of Beethoven's most popular piano sonatas I have heard. I have heard some other renditions of these works but this holds its own against any. My personal favorite is the third movement of the ""Appasionata"" which Jandó concludes with a brilliant flurry. A super work in every way."
3,Fine but unimaginative,"This disc can serve as a good introduction to Beethoven's piano sonatas for the total newbie, starting with the 3 most popular works. The approach is standard at best, cold at worst, no risks taken, the tempi move at clockwork speed, the metronome being more important than the composer's or the performer's spirit. Even the famous 1st movement of the ""Moonlight"" just breezes through. Listeners who already know these works will find nothing new here."
3,sex comedy,A light farce of a jungle goddess hunted for her inheritance and treasure. Not a bad movie for the this type of movie. Nudity included.
3,Mediocre Movie!,"This movie had to be a drivein special. The women were georgous but that's where it ended. Hamilton Hornee hasbenn hired by the Wabash bank in Indianapolis to travel to Africa and find a missing Matthews heir named Prentiss. He is accompanied by his secretary Sultry Sommers,Tender Lee and two more heirs Max and Doris Matthews.Also traveling with them on the trip is Dr. Stanley Livingston who wans to search for Nabucco the white gorilla.Upon entering the jungle they are captured by feirce African tribesmen. Shortly thereafter they discover that Prentiss the missing cousin is actually Algona the white goddess who rules this tribe. After some attempts at action and humor the safari people escape. One member stays behind. I didn't remember seeing this movie at the drivein during the 1970's."
1,Innuendo porn,"As usual the acting was weak and the story so-so. NO VALID ROMANCE. When it came to the ""exotic"" parts, the DVD movie skipped beyond minute displays of frolicing nudes. As for comedy, maybe after a few kegs. By then, you'll laugh at anything, well anything like this waste of funds."
2,Someone was in a hurry,"Everything on this CD sounds like the orchestra had somewhere to be... quickly. Sloppy articulation from the strings who are struggling to keep up ruins the piece's coherence.The post-production reverb tries to cover this up, but it's all just a waste."
5,Great...,"Never had an impact driver until I saw it with my brother-in-law. He had the same one for his business and swore by it. I had to get on for myself when I built my deck. Drove the 3"" screws and 6"" lag bolts great. I only wish I had it earlier. Love it."
4,Great storage!,"These stackable boxes are great - you can alter the length and width of the storage area (not the height) to suit your ornaments. To protect fragile ornaments, you need to use bubble wrap or some protective covering, but this handy little storage box fits a lot of ornaments, is compact, keeps them clean, and it helped me determine which ornaments I really wanted to keep. I give four stars because the cardboard dividers are not up to the quality of the boxes themselves, and it would be nice to have the boxes provide some buffer if the ornaments are dropped. But all said - they're worth the money and I love them."
4,Great Storage for Odds & Ends,"I'm more than pleased with this storage box. I read all the reviews before purchasing and was concerned that the clips might be broke or the box dented as some people had commented. It arrived all in one piece and was very well wrapped and boxed. It was exactly what I wanted and needed for my miscellaneous holiday ornaments and accoutrements! I removed the cardboard separators for one layer and put my ornamnents hooks and Christmas tags in there. These are items I always have to search for because I forget where I put them. I put all of my specialty ornaments that didn't come with their own box in the compartments and they fit very well. Now I have everything special in one storage container and know at a glance, that's it's my holiday decorations."
1,Christmas Storage Box,"This item is a rip-off. The seller portrays it to be 6 snapware containers in a picture without a description for $49.95, when infact it is only 3 snapware containers that are sent. Amazon also sells the same 3 snapware containers for 24.99, but says so and shows a picture of 3. Thank goodness I was able to get my money, refunded. It also can be bought in local stores in my area, for $19.99."
1,"""Out of Stock"" Canceled Order but Listed ""In Stock""","Can't give negative stars. Xmas ornament storage box order canceled by Amazon due to ""Out of Stock"" a week after order but item is still listed ""In Stock"". I'm glad after reading review that reports the dividers are cheap cardboard."
1,Do not order this product!,"I did the research and read the other reviews, but though...""what are the odds mine will be damaged as well?"" Apparently, pretty good! As many others have reported, one of the storage boxes came out of the packaging broken. I had not even touched it yet! The product appears to be very fragile. My recommendation is to look elsewhere and not buy this item."
4,Great product,"This storage box is a really great size and holds many ornaments of various sizes. I'm happy with the quality of the item, but was not impressed with the shipping/handling method. Although I received the item very quickly, it was packaged in a box with no padding, therefore one corner of my container was cracked right down the side. The sellers kindly offered to replace the item, but I declined because I needed the item immediately, and I was able to tape the side together. The cardboard dividers are kind of cheap, I was expecting plastic dividers, but nonetheless, I'm still happy with the product."
4,Great Bulb Holder,"CHRISTMAS ORNAMENT STORAGE BOXGreat way to store ornaments. I purchased this item to store my larger ornaments, however, there is no padding, so I do worry. We will see if all goes well when we take them down for next year's use."
2,CHEAP!!!,"While the boxes are nice, the clasps that hook onto the cover or another container are flimsy and break easily. I WASN'T a happy camper when carrying the whole contraption down to the basement and the cover popped off because of a broken clasp. Fortunately, only 4 ornaments broke. I will be buying a different storage container next year."
5,Great way to store Christmas ornaments,"I bought these to store my Christmas ornaments and love them. They snap together so you can keep your ornaments all organized. We have two trees each year, so it keeps each tree's ornaments together."
4,Christmas is over!,"I had wanted to purchase these bins at Lowes before Christmas, but they were out of them by the time I decided to buy them. I read all of the pros and cons on the other reviews and decided to try them and just keep the drawbacks in mind. I'm happy with them, I bought two sets and was able to fit all of my tree ornaments in them without all of the usual tissue paper. Plastic dividers would have been nicer than the cardboard, but they still worked. I put strap around each of them before picking them up by the handle, as other users said the clips broke easily. The best thing is that I don't have to unpack every ornament just to get to the one I want. So, overall I am very happy with them and would recommend them."
4,Pretty good ornament storage,"The snaps on the trays and lid that hold this box together are flimsy, so pick it up and carry it by the bottom tray and not by the top handle. Otherwise, I like this box. It's opaque so you can see what's inside, and the dividers keep the ornaments separated so no wrapping is required. Overall, it works pretty well."
4,Too expensive,I love these. I do not use inserts because my ornaments vary in sizes. I use bubble wrap and it works perfectly. I was looking for more and couldn't believe price. Glad I kept searching! Go to snapware.com
4,Flexible storage,This container works great for Christmas ornaments. The size of the compartments is adjustable so you can choose which size to use in each tier.
4,does its job,This box is more than an adequate storage box for ornaments that you generally use just once a year. It keeps them separated and reasonably safe from damage. The inside partitions are simple cardboard and could be sturdier.
2,Not for the price...,"I was looking forward to organizing all of my ornaments but when my storage box arrived and it was time to de-Christmas, I noticed the cardboard dividers were too small for the compartments and there was a large crack in the lid. I understand that this crack most likely happened during the shipping process even though the box was labeled 'fragile' and 'handle with care'. I was actually surprised that there was no other packing material, just the storage box dropped into the shipping box, which may have prevented this accident from occuring. Needless to say, I'm returning this product with no intent to replace. I was highly disappointed in the quality for the price."
1,lots of storage but half the locking tabs were broken,check the locking tabs before you actually put your ornaments in so you don't waste your time. half the tabs were broken because of cheap plastic.
3,Connector Tabs Break,The plastic connector tabs break off and cannot connect to the cube making this very unusable for the purpose intended.
1,Broke within 5 minutes after taking it out of the box,"I opened the box, took out the product and began separating the units from each other and one of the clips broke so now it won't lock. I decided to move the unit with the broken latch to the bottom and hope that the others don't break as well. Great concept, poor quality. I probably should return it."
2,Nice Idea,"Great idea and the boxes are well made, however the plastic snaps that hold everything together are not well made and break easily. Once broken, you need tape or a box or a bungee cord to keep the whole thing together. Not worth it overall."
4,Does it's duty,"It got here fine, the corners of the actual container were cracked though. I am very picky about these things but since I don't want to spend extra money for one that is perfect, I'm keeping this one. Hope next time a box says ""FRAGILE"" the people delivering the package will actually care."
2,Dividers are cheap and don't fit!,"This box is a great idea, but what you can't see in the photo is that the cheap cardboard dividers that come with the plastic box do not fit into the grooves inside the plastic box. They just fit together grid-style inside the box. That means the ornaments aren't secured, and for heavy ornaments won't work at all.This would be great if you were trying to store cheap ball ornaments from Walmart... but I'm not, so I'll definitely be returning this for something with secured dividers."
1,Cheap junk,Do not waste your money. The tabs that are used to snap the layers together break off. I bought 3 of these last year and stored my ornaments in them at the end of the season. I now have a full stack of 4 that don't have tabs on them.
4,Christmas Ornament Storage Box,These storage boxes help keep you organized and allow you to throw away all of the boxes and tissue paper you normally use to protect ornaments. I have purchased a few of the boxes from different sources and am very happy with them. I can easily see the ornaments and no longer have to search through numerous boxes for the ones I want to use. Taking down the tree is much faster using these boxes and packing up the ornaments is no longer a chore.
4,Pleased... mostly.,"I am overall quite pleased with this product. The cardboard dividers are not white as pictured, but are a regular brown cardboard color. It doesn't detract from the function; however, only the aesthetics.Really, the only problem I had with this product was the shipping. The first storage box arrived damaged because there isn't any protection offered by the cardboard box it is shipped in. The company (""Get Organized"") provided excellent customer service and shipped another one very quickly and without question. The second one arrived even more damaged than the first. Between the two boxes I was able to collect enough usable pieces to make one whole storage box.If you don't mind taking your chances and ordering repeatedly through customer service, I would suggest this item for you. If you don't have patience, I would find another box from another vendor (not ""Get Organized"")."
3,Ornament Storage Box,"The storage container arrived damaged with a corner of the lid broken off, but it didn't hinder the containers functionality."
2,Partition dividers,"The dividers are made of cheap card board, they do not stand up, they are not made long enough so they do not hookfrom one side of the box to the other side, the ornaments are not secured properly"
3,Boardmaker rates 3 stars. Overboard rates 5 stars.,"I downloaded Overboard from gusinc.com and bought a copy of Boardmaker to evaluate them both for my daughter (you can't download Boardmaker). They are similar but Overboard is much easier to use, and the symbols looked more ""real"". Boardmaker symbols looked like they were for very small children (kindergarten?)."
3,In relentless pursuit of a better product,"My Bull Mastiff had cruciate ligament surgery on both rear legs before he was even a year old. He is now 5 years old. He also has many pollen and food allergies. I am always searching for a product that contains ingredients he can tolerate and will help him with his pain. Also,the products I've tried in the past are extremely expensive for a 145lb dog. This product is less expensive.I chose this product based on it's ingredients. Though it may be too early to see results, I don't think this product is as effective as Fosters or Cosequin. I have been using it for 3 weeks now."
5,Sophisticated People Have Art Auctions...,"Rednecks have yard sales. This is yet another solid album from the king of redneck comedy, Jeff Foxworthy. This guy had some very interesting toys (ball-and-paddle), and he knows a lot about the redneck culture. Buy this. You will not be let down."
5,Great Little Travel Back,"I bought one like this almost 5 years ago, and it's still going strong. For a couple of years, I traveled weekly back-and-forth to Washington, DC and from there all over the world and this little suitcase and its included laptop case withstood the rigors of countless Southwest Airlines luggage compartments, and being subjected to untold indignities inflicted upon it by the ""travel Nazis"" (the TSA) without a problem.The included laptop case is quite functional on its own, and I use it whenever I need to take one of my laptops (Mac or PC) to a meeting or presentation."
1,Bad Quality.,"The transfer in this set is of very-poor quality. Save your money. The movie EL DIA QUE ME QUIERAS has a reasonable transfer in the stand alone DVD, which I also bought."
3,"Good selections, but mediocre performance","The selection of pieces is great-- these are all great pieces of classical music with strong Spanish influence. However, the performances lack fire and often come across as mechanical. They get close, but don't quite do the pieces justice."
4,Fully accurate scale tank,"I purchased this tank at a Target retail store. I was please with the quality of the vehicle. It has no actualy shooting parts. Treads are rubber and the wheels for them move when the tank is pushed along. 2 hatches on top are the only spots for your figure to sit in and they open and close. The hatches cannot be closed when figures are in the tank.the only downside of the tank is that the seat positions are very narrow. Vintage Joe, marvel showdown,or Corp figures will not fit easily. Modern CORPS figures will not fit at all.Elite forces, Elite operations, and modern Joe were OK fit and look good in the turret. Be careful if giving this to a child as the driver's arms both broke on mine when moved due to the articulation style of the elbows. Figure was awsome looking so I superglued this arms and put him back in place though"
4,If you like military detail you like this replica.,This toy really exhibits the detail and accuracy associated with the M1A1 tank. I being military and having spent four years working on these models really appreciated getting this collectible for remembrance purposes
4,bottle is the size and width of your thumb,"I like the smell of Gardenia which is basically what this oil is. I feel like I could have gotten a lot more for $50 because the size of the bottle is tiny! But I use it daily and it lasts all day without being overpowering, it's a very subtle scent that one can only smell if they are right beside you."
5,Gret Product - Steep Price,"I love the Kai Oil. As one previous reviewer said it is not alot for the price. I agree the Kai Oil needs to be in a bigger container. Also the Body Wash is great too, also too little."
2,"Nice fragrance, but doesn't last.","I thought the oil would help this perfume last, but alas, it didn't for me. I love gardenias. I even bought the lotion to layer the fragrance, but that didn't help either."
5,Like a garden of island flowers...,"I received a sample of Kai then had to buy a full-size immediately! It's a blend of gardenia & other flowers and the scent is truly spectacular. My husband said, ""You smell just like a garden of flowers,"" (!) & could hardly stop smelling my neck - this from a guy who usually shrugs & says says ""Nice,"" when I ask about any perfume I'm trying. It's gorgeous, and unlike many scents, it's very long-lasting, too. It's purely floral, lots of gardenia - so if you prefer spicy or chypre scents, steer clear. But if you love florals, especially white florals, you;ll love it. It's a staple for me now."
2,Way too strong.,"This perfume is way too strong. I ordered it online because all of the reviews say its a faint smell. THey are wrong. I barely put a dab on both wrists and my neck and the smell is so overpowering that its given me a headache.It does not smell that flowery, mostly gardenia.Its definitely not what I expected. I will probably send this to my grandmother because it smells like a perfume for someone closer to her age."
2,OK songs 4 worship,"I was disappointed with this album. I was excited when I saw it advertised, but not so happy when I received and played it. There are way too many songs by the same group, and even then I didn't think they were that great! I thought the ""Songs 4..."" albums were supposed to be filled with songs by various performers. However, this one certainly wasn't. Just be aware of this before purchasing!"
1,Disappointing,"I was hoping for the postcards to show better pictures from the Book of Kells. They don't show off the beautifull knotwork from the book like I hoped, even though they are cheap, still not worth the money."
3,Does a good job,"I have a few cats and a dog. So far I have been fairly happy with this vacuum. I will say that it doesn't do as great of a job on small area rugs as it did when it was new. It seems to get clogged up fairly quickly and when I go to do the area rugs the hair/dust ball up and deposit on the rug. In fact it hardly picks up anything on the rugs no matter what setting I use. It does do a good job on the hard floors, it does blow things around quite a bit, but I think most all vaccumms will do this. The definate downfall is the bag. It is a pretty small collection bag that, for my use, needs to be changed often. But overall I am happy with the vacuum and it does a good job. My complaits as I said are the lack of picking up on rugs, the blowing around and the bag."
4,"great for small places, no carpet","This vacuum is small, lightweight yet strong and as the name says, it's 3-in-1 (more like 2-in-1 really). You can use it as an upright cleaner or detach the main body and hold it in your had, while vacuuming with or without the wand attachment. The brush roller is suction type, not powered, so will not really clean carpet well. As such, I think this unit is best used in small apt/condo/home settings where the floor is non-carpeted. The bag inside is small but it's not a problem in small places. A 10-pk replacement bags is not too expensive on ebay. I like that its bagged and not bagless. I think bagless started as a fad years ago and kinds just stuck. Aside from your home, it makes vacuuming your car easy as well. It loses a star b/c the exhaust vent is somewhat awkwardly located and it actually blows out towards the floor. It would've made more sense if it blew at least parallel to the floor or even at an upward angle."
1,A poor performer and a poor value,"A clever design is crippled by the lack of a crucial feature: a powered beater brush. The Transformax 180's air-powered brush is worthless, because it stops rotating the second it touches carpet, which of course is exactly when you need it most.I've owned this vac for three years, but two years ago I bought a $40 Swivel Sweeper, and since then the Transformax 180 has languished in the closet. Believe it or not, the Swivel Sweeper--with no suction, but with POWERED brushes--picks up more dirt and hair than the Transformax 180 ever did.Considering that the Transformax is much less effective than the Swivel Sweeper but costs five times as much, that makes this product a spectacularly bad value. When you add the fact that the Swivel Sweeper is cordless, relatively quiet, and stores in a small fraction of the space required by the Transformax... well, it's just no contest."
1,SEVERE SHRINKAGE,"Nice sheets, as long as you don't have one of the new mattresses, or plan on getting one.My mattress is 15"", and these sheets are supposed to work with 18"" mattresses.The sheets fit - just - when I got them - but now, six months later, they do not fit."
4,BIG pill but goes down easy,"These are *huge* pills; some of the biggest I've seen. That being said, they are coated so they go down fairly easily.They seem to have made a difference where they're supposed to and I like the Source Naturals brand in general.I will buy them again if Amazon is selling them."
5,blood circulation and recovery,"As an older male, I am always interested in products which help blood circulation and recovery from workouts. I had recently been experiencing lower back pain due to high usage. I started using this product and found instant results. My discomfort and pain decreased within a few days and my circulation increased in my mid section with it. I believe it has affected my whole region if you know what I mean. I combine it with equal number of pills of hawthorn berry for maximum effect. I take 3 to 4 pills each of the L-Arginine/L-Citrulline Complex and the hawthorn berry on empty stomach when I rise in the morning and the same immediately following my workout. Gives me a fighting chance!"
1,"Warning - This DVD is not a concert, it is a documentary!","This was put out in mid-October 2008. I along with at least a few others thought it was the same live concert footage that used to be in VHS, but, now on a DVD. Amazon has comments attached to it from the VHS version which was the live concert (plus some interviews) and that is why it still has a high star rating. I am planning to return this as DVD 2 and DVD 3 are overly redundant in content as well."
3,Grooming Case,"This case is not as sturdy as I had expected it to be. The components of the case have to be ""jiggled"" around to get the clasps to close. Once it is closed, it seems to stay that way well enough, but the instability of the case does concern me. I considered returning it, but decided not to due to convenience issues more than anything else. It does do fine accomodating my supplies and I could fit more than I expected into it."
4,Looking for Answers?,"A straight-forward explanation of causes for loss of sexual desire in women. It offers psychological (body image, depression, stress, relationship issues), physical, and drug/medical reasons. For these it suggests the best treatment depending on the cause, plus has a section on how to talk with your partner about the problem.Useful to know the likely causes and gives a starting point for changing things."
1,You can find more complete info in other books.,"This book seems likes an attempt to cash in on the growing interest of women in testosterone deficiency. Rako's book gives more complete information. Also, Reichman's style tries so hard to be cute & entertaining that it felt patronizing to me."
3,My wife is still not in the mood.,"I read the book. My wife said she did, but I believe she just glanced through it. No change, - no better, no more frequent."
2,Not for the 20-something female,"As a 28 year old mom with a 14 month old son and mild depression, I thought I'd buy this book. However, when I read the book, it told me nothing I didn't already know. I wish she could have written a chapter that reaches women in their 20s having these issues. I literally ear-marked 3 pages, which were the only three pages out of the whole book that applied to me. Moreso for women in their 30s-60s."
3,Menopausal? This one's for you!,"This book really focuses on organic desire problems, mainly loss of libido due to hormone fluctations. It really pushes the use of testosterone to increase libido, and other remedies and procedures that are largely geared towards much older women (usually through menopause). THIS IS NOT A HELPFUL BOOK FOR WOMEN UNDER 40."
3,What's New?,"I've been a Chicago Fan all my life. Though it's nice to stroll down memory lane with another compilation..What is this..Their 14th greatest hits album? It would be nice to hear a new offering. I do not like to be teased with 2 new songs here and there. I do not like the fact that they seem to have chosen the idea of ""outsourcing"" their songwriting. What ever happened to the much talked about ""Stone of Sisyphus""? If these guys are tired and just want to stay together and do the ""Beach Boys"" thing, great! Thanks for the memories! Otherwise, please stop teasing your loyal fans!"
5,The greatest of many great albums,"Perhaps the best way to describe the sounds of CHICAGO is to mention that they have taken the art of music to a new level. They have achieved what so many artists strive for ""Perfection"". To the band originaly known as ""The Chicago Transit Authority"" a sincere and simple THANK YOU!"
5,A must for American Chicago Fans,"This is an awesome CD that contains three tracks from the unreleased album ""Stone Of Sisyphus"" (""The Pull, ""Here With Me"", and ""Bigger Than Elvis"") and it has numerous edited single versions of songs that were heard on the air when they were hits that were previously unavailable on CD. The only downfall is that the insert talks in depth about the story behind each song, but it is in Japanese."
5,Excellent Book,This is a excellent book and does a terrific job taking you through the WorkShop and using it to create Web Services.I could have probably stumbled through the stuff without going through this book but it would have taken me much longer and I wouldn't have learned as much.If you want to get up and running quick with this WorkShop tool buy this book and you will be rocking in a short time.
4,Super Ladies of Wrestling,"this was a nice tape to watch, had some great women on it wrestling, cant wait to see more. thanks!!!!"
2,It Could Have Been Better!!!,"Seriously, the only reason I bought this is because in my Senior year in high School, I wrote a story sort of like this, but mine is WAY better! A guy named Otto is released from an asylum and soon after, he kills his wife. Since he's a butcher, he decides to use her as meat and sale it to the customers. (Delicious!) I probably wouldn't recommend THE MAD BUTCHER. (a.k.a.) MEAT IS MEAT!!!p.s. Two more days 'til HALLOWEEN!!!"
1,"don't bother, some movies are bad but funny, well this one is just painful","Absolutely painful. It keeps just enough of your interest to keep you waiting for a payoff that never comes. Give your Mom a camcorder, a meat grinder and a chef's knife and you'll get a better film."
3,To Dub or not to Dub,I recall seeing this on an old VHS many moons ago (it may have been under its alternate title MEAT IS MEAT).I am wondering if anyone who has this DVD release can tell me if Victor Buono's voice is dubbed = he was a marvellous actor who I remember best of all as King Tut from the old Batman TV series.
5,Excellent video!,"If you are a fan of the older style of wrestling, this is a must own! Features a legends match with Terry Funk vs. Tully Blanchard, with commentary for this match from the greatest - Gordon Solie. Also Flair vs. Windham, Cactus Jack/Kevin Sullivan vs. The Nasty Boys, and Sting vs. Vader for the Heavyweight strap. If you missed it on PPV, you must buy this!"
3,Foley fan's will love this!,Foley and Sullivan take on the the nasty boys in a match that shows just how much abuse Mick Foley is willing to take in order to get over with the fans! The rest of the show is just passible.
4,Great Buy! Great Video!,"As soon as I saw this tape I bought it. Its got some classic matches. Sting vs. Vader was a great main event. You see Cactus Jack (Mic Foley) win his first title in WCW. Ric Flair, Terry Funk, Dustin Rhodes, Larry Zybzco, Steven Regal, Steve Austin, Nasty Boys, and many more in action. Also they do the annual inducting of older wrestlers into the hall of fame. Great Buy for 9 dollars."
4,Pretty good PPV for WCW,"This PPV took place in the backyard of ECW, Philadelphia, PA, and the WCW put on a watchable show. Terry Funk piledriving Tully Blanchard through a piece of wood. Cactus Jack/Kevin Sullivan vs. Nasty Boys in a Philadelphia Broadstreet Bully Match is a very good ""street fight"" with lots of stiff action. The return of Barry Windham to WCW against Ric Flair! Watch ""Stunning"" Steve Austin fight pre-Stone Cold days! A great buy!"
3,Simple Explanations,"Despite the errors, I'm enjoying this book. The explanations are clear and straight forward. Editing is terrible, so you might get frustrated at some of the answers in the exercises."
2,"Good concepts, terrible editing.","Forgotten chemistry is a book that was clearly not edited by someone with a science background. The text is clear and an acceptable review of the concepts, however problems and examples are laden with terrible mistakes.Gah! Barron's website offers no help, no errata. Try something else if this frustrates you as much as it does me!"
3,Great refresher but many errors in the excercises.,"This book makes chemistry so much easier than the way I learned it in college. It's a great refresher and information is presented very well. However, there are many errors in the answers to the excercises. Otherwise, a very good book."
2,"Too many errors, but makes the concepts understandable","I've never read a book with so many errors! The author is listed also as the editor, which I can see is a problem. One or two errors would have been understandable, but there are a few in just about every chapter! And it's a shame because the writing is actually very good in explaining science concepts. I probably would have otherwise given this book 4 stars. However, constantly having to second-guess my answers in the molar-mass section, for example, was extrememly frustrating because of the errors with the exponents. I didn't know if my answers were wrong or the author's were. The errors don't give you a lot of confidence in the book."
5,An excellent CD of Nutcracker/Swan Lake excerpts,"I bought this record when I was young, more than 15 years ago. But after a month or two a deep cut in it made it not playable anymore (it was the time we all took as true the message that CD were indestructible).Then I listened to several versions of Nutcracker and Swan Lake, but no one gave me the same feelings and I always felt this version was the ""right"" one (imho, at least): delicate, fairy-tale, evocative.At present days, I decided to search for this record to listen to it again, and the feelings are the same.According to me, Michael Halasz has really interpreted this music as it was meant to be.The sound: even if it's not a ""big boomy"" sound to test your 1000W home thatre equipment, I think it's simply perfect for this music."
3,Disappointing,"This toy was diappointing. At first it did not hold my grandson's interest. When he got older and seemed interested in it, it no longer worked."
3,Little Leap Pad $29.99,"No need to pay the ridiculous price that Amazon is quoting. SImply go to leapfrog.com the home site of all Leap Frog, Leap pad items. It is $29.99 and you can purchase the books for $5.00. They are discontinuing this so hurry!"
4,SUBSTANCE AND FACT...ALSO A BIT DENSE,"I had to purchase this book for one of my Master's classes and found this book well worth the read and filled with many different and usable facts for the purposes of research and papers. If you are purchasing this book for the purposes of a ""casual"" read then you may feel that the book is a bit dense and impersonal. You have to understand the purpose of the book and the audience he is writing for."
4,"great music, arrogant, insulting liner notes","I love this music and glad that I have it. But I regret ONE DIME of my money going to such a condescending, arrogant jerk as John Fahey, who wrote the liner notes for the music he loves by the people he mocks. At best, he says Catholics are real Christians and Evangelicals are pagans. His blanket statements and complete misunderstanding of Evangelicals, and Protastants in general, to say nothing of his denigration of the place that the experience of Christ plays for these ""filthy savages"" would be laughable if it wasn't so mean spirited. Get the music. Don't pay for it."
4,Good buy,"Shipped fast. Good condition. The one thing that was sort of strange, is that it dosen't show any letters that were sent to Chopin himself, so a lot of his replys do not make sense. Also every time that he wrote two or more consecutive letters to the same person, it is addressed ""To the Same"" so you have to look all the way back to the first. In the case of Juliana Fontana this can span for more than ten pages."
1,do not buy,this product was unsatisfactory to my expectations u have to hassle with it to upgrade stuff cause u dont even know the website to do so. and if u want to add stuff half the formats it says it accepts dont even play and the visual access of the movies are CRAP!!!! I would not recommend buying this product. WASTE OF MONEY!!!
4,Nice Italian...,"Naxos deserves kudos' for coming up with this colorful collection of Italian inspired works by mostly non Italian composers. This lively set includes no less than three tarantelle with French, Hungarian, and Russian spice. The ""Venetian Gondodier Song"" is the most humble of the pieces.So your in for a lot of folksy melodies here! For authenticity two of Italy's favorite sons, Luigi Denza and opera great Leoncavallo crash this Italian wanabee party with two big hits.Lenard and his Bratislava orchestra play with vigor and commitment like old ""pisanos"". What ever their ethnic backgroundall involved make this disc a pure joy! Magnifico!!!"
2,"Looks real good, but....",The red leather looks very nice. But whoever designed these missed the measurements. also the belt clip is way too bulky making my Sansa e140 twice as big as it should be. I hardly use it because it is so awkward and I am considering selling this thing on ebay.
2,Cover is Too Tight,"Loved the look of this case. Color is very pretty. Cutouts in the right places. But I had one major problem with it, it was so tight that I really couldn't snap the cover closed. If I tugged and pulled and finally did close it, I had a lot of difficulty getting it back out! I ended up not using the case."
5,One Man's Trash is Another's Treasure,"Having just won the National Pie Championship this year, I decided to invest in more pie books to expand my pie knowledge. I was thrilled to get a copy of this book. This vintage book penned by Nettie Mc Birney, aka Aunt Chick writes in a straight forward manner. Aunt Chick found that she could teach any woman ""to make a good pie in five minutes if she used my (her) equipment and followed her fool-proof directions."" This book was part of Aunt Chick's Non-Stick Pastry Kit and in 1950, sold for 35 cents. I was able to purchase the pastry presses to make beautiful designs from the present owner of Gramma's Cutters. You can get the pastry (canvas)frame and sock on Amazon.com I own over 10 pie cookbooks and this is one of the most cherished."
1,Will not work on any DVD player,Still have this on my counter but will probably throw it away. It does not work on any of my DVD players-I have 3. I thought about returning it but completely forgot so it's probably too late now. So decide for yourselves. I tried to give it no rating but had to give it a star.
1,Poor Quality,"This DVD was returned by me because it would not play in any DVD player in my home. The box looks great and gives you the impression that the music will be great, then you insert the DVD and nothing happens.Not worth the $$$."
1,A waste of money...,"This book merely re-hashes old training techniques that anyone could find on the internet for free.It has nothing to do with protection training and is full of grammatical errors - didn't the authors use a spell checker, for God's sake?Poorly written *and* worthless information.......this book is a loser on all counts!"
5,Hard to find in stores..,"Glad I found this on Amazon. Very silky, good for dry ends of hair. Does not leave a gunky build up."
5,When will they get it????,"Cecil Taylor is one of the great jazz pianists, and all creative improvisors need to deal with his music. This session from 1963 features some great music (the out-of-tune piano and the recording quality don't detract much from my enjoyment of it). Cecil's compositions and the group's playing are great.This is actually a fairly conservative record, and it puzzles me why other people find this music so difficult. The group's rendition of ""What's New"" follows the standard form and chord changes. I can tap my foot to almost all of the record, and some of it swings quite outright. Most of Cecil's chord voicings are standard, and he also plays quite a few roots on the head and in Jimmy Lyons' first chorus. I'll never understand why people think this stuff is strange."
4,"5-Star Content, 1-Star Packaging Penalty","As the other reviews state, this is some brilliant music. However, the premium price for these discs does not reflect what the packaging offers. As the AMG would say, somewhat disdainfully, this is a ""straight re-issue"" of the two-LP set on Freedom available in the 70s. While that edition added to the 1964 single Fantasy ""Montmarte"" LP, Revenant's minimalist package has no notes beyond the wrap-around J-card on the outside of the case. The Fantasy LP had a striking color photo of CT; the Freedom had some nice artwork. For $32, I would like an essay or at least a couple of photos of the players."
5,Doris being Doris...and that's a good thing!,"'Nude on the Moon' is a delightfully ridiculous cult classic from the Grand Mistress of low-budget sexploitation cinema, Doris Wishman. It is definitely my favorite Doris Wishman nudie-cutie title.In this picture, our astronaut heros are surprised and delighted to find that the moon is inhabited by topless women (and a couple of men) that communicate telepathically via pipe-cleaner antennae! Oh, and of course the moon is practically littered with huge chunks of solid gold! A good portion of the film focuses on Jeff and 'The Professor' as they walk around taking photos of the women at play and writing notes on their discoveries while talking without their lips moving! Fantastic!!! Gotta love Doris!"
1,"You'll need a stiff drink after this one. Or, better yet, have three before","Thankfully, there are at least a few moments of the ""so bad it's hilarious"" variety in this film (a prime reason one checks out these ""Something Weird"" DVD's, right?), but- sadly- large chunks of this particular offering are just plain bad period. Bad as in inane, boring, dull, etc. If you have this playing in the background at a party or informal get-together, it might work: viewers can make fun of the intermittent funny stuff, check out the women, but then tune it out and go back to their conversations during the frequent dull stretches. But to just sit and watch this, giving it your undivided attention? No, no, no. Don't do that to yourself."
1,The Final Cut...The ending. There is none!,"I kept waiting for this movie to go somewhere...then it just suddenly ends with no resolution. I see reviewers saying ""they GET the ending"". There IS no ending. The screenwriter just ran outta steam...or drugs, whichever the case may be. Fine performance by Robin Williams...which is the ONLY reason to watch this dud. What a shame. Great idea. Great actors. Lousy moviemakers! Glad I only paid 80 cents for this at my local Chinese DVD store."
2,Another sleepwalking performance,"Starts off well, but after two minutes of Williams' trademark sleepwalking (non)expression, it's almost unwatchable. And he plasters it onto his face for almost the entire movie. It's a blank stare with nothing behind it, and it grates on you quickly. The pace is plodding, and he makes it seem plodding-er.The visuals/sets are an uncomfortable mishmash with no coherence. The concept of a life-recording implant is interesting, but to call it a thriller is ... well, lying. It raises some interesting questions about memory and privacy, but that's about it. The ending is a dud."
3,"Poor execution, plot was wasted","I highly enjoy purchasing movies I have yet to see, and experience awsome surprises with excellent plots, believable dialogue, and stunning graphics or cinematography. Sadly, this movie fails in all but one of those areas.The plot and cast are under-utilized, and the movie seems to drag on, yet strangley, carries you along for a ride you think is going to get better... it doesn't.Without spoiling the plot points, some set-up scenarios are failed of explanation; its seemed as if this movie was written for the purpose of setting up The Final Cut 2, but I doubt it.I was really hoping Robin Williams would finally punch through in a non-comedic role (he came close to masterful in One Hour Photo, but failed in Insomnia), but the plot never materialized into what it could have been, and the movie failed to provide the proper foundation for a Williams' dynamite performance.I suggest renting this one."
2,Outrageously Boring,"I tired, I tried, I tired to give this movie a chance. It let me down every time."
2,"Good Idea for a movie, too bad they didn't produce one.","I was really disappointed in this movie. Robin Williams being one of my favorite actors and talented to boot, played terribly in this movie. Maybe it was the role he was playing, but he was definitely not the right pick for the role either. I squirmed at his attempt to add humor to a serious role where humor would not have been appropriate.The movie seemed to last forever with no real excitement or suspense. It just told a boring story. Maybe one of the great and better known Sci-Fi Directors could have done better."
2,Not Quite,"This movie was fairly interesting, but I wasn't too impressed.The acting was decent enough, that's not what I was bothered by. I kept feeling like everything was so abrupt and there was no flow to the story.I ended up finishing it, but I remember thinking a few times during it that I could turn if off and wouldn't be too upset for having missed it.I wouldn't highly suggest this movie, but I could see it becoming like a ""cult classic"" because the premise of it is so interesting. It just didn't get tied together into a story that sucked you in.= EK"
2,Producer needs to go back to school... to learn to produce.,"This movie has a lot of potential.. lots of neat ideas and good starts... and an equal amount of loose ends. The plot is weak (as in, it's difficult to spot, and when you do spot it, you wonder what the fuss was about), and occasionally the producer shows you something intriguing, and then never follows up with it, leaving you to wonder what the significance was. The little bit of the plot I managed to deduce I felt was lame.. some protesters needed proof that the ceo (or whatever) of a company was a bad guy (who did something completely unrelated to the product of the company) so they can shut his company down. Wow. I wonder what Robin Williams was doing acting in this movie. He's way above this."
5,You may like to watch what the future may bring.,This film manages to present a futuristic controversy as if present today. Our own secret sins may be for display thanks to technological advances. What may others think?
2,This movie had potential...,"But they failed in the final product. There story line was great, but they took it nowhere. The ending wasn't much better, I was hoping for more out of Robin Williams, he has turned in some good performances in the past in some really serious movies. I wasted my money renting this movie!"
3,Interesting Movie!,"An interesting movie. It explores the meaning of memory, the importance (or unimportance) of memory, and chronicles the tricks that memory can play, on all of us. As usual, Robin Williams playing a serious character (as in One Hour Photo and Death to Smoochie - sort of) seems to bear no resemblance to his manic side, which is the one he shows us in his TV interviews, stand-up shows, etc. That he can go from one persona to another means to me that he is a great actor . . heaven only knows who he really is.Anyway, the movie could have been much more than it was. This movie was a paragraph but it could have been a short story."
2,Confusing!,"Robin Williams continues his diverse acting ability with this role. Unfortunately, his performance is not enough to save this movie from itself. The film had the potential to be a blockbuster. The problem is where it wants to go. It doesn't know if it wants to be a psychological thriller, a Sci-Fi Fantasy or a moving Drama. There wasn't enough to identify the characters and make us care. With more time and added scenes, this movie could have been something. Disappointing!"
2,RETARTED YET INTERESTING BUT MOSTELY RETARTED.,AFTER RENTING THIS MOVIE I THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY IT. BECAUSE ROBIN WILLIAMS IS IN A MOVIE DOESN'T REALLY MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD. I THOUGHT THAT THE IDEA WAS WACK AND THE CAST WAS CRAPPY EXCEPT FOR OFF COURSE ROBIN WILLIAMS. BOTTOM LINE IS ITSUCKED.
2,Usually but now always great,"I used to love this product. I had been using it for three years and had recommended it to many people who also loved it. However, the last time I purchased the Vitamin E sticks, three of them broke at the base with just normal use. It seemed like the product was softer than usual. I contacted the company (Reviva Labs) by email but never heard back from them. I am afraid to purchase it again since I lost out on three sticks and the company never bothered to contact me."
2,Missing the Curve...,"This was one of the blandest books I've ever read. Kept reading and reading just to see how all the weird dreams and signals would come together. Nothing.I wanted so much for Lewis to find his way by using his non-seeing senses. This would've been his way of finally bonding with his blind son. It also would've made me care more about whether Lewis ever got back to his son. The characters were transparent and the story predictable. I want to be surprised when I read an adventure like this! I learned nothing new about Africa. I didn't care about the characters.I've read much better books set in the Congo that have me right there with the characters. It was as if Mr. Stevens' editors cut all the visceral descriptions to make room for something else, but I don't know what, exactly. Try again, Mr. Stevens. I want to take a trip when I read. Make me forget I'm reading a story. Feed me an experience."
4,Curve Ball,"The number of reviews contained here about The Curve of the World is indicative of the effect this book will have on the reader. It is a stunning first novel, able to pull the reader into a journey that is both harrowing and illuminating. I am not going to rehash what others have already said concerning the book--for it is all that is said--but I will add that I was captivated. I truly escaped into the story. The one thing that bothererd me, though, is trying to figure out why Helen goes to such lengths to find Lewis. There is very little in the book that creates a feeling that even once upon a time the couple were truly in love. The relationship is in tatters, with Helen preoccupied with raising their blind son, but nowhere do I feel they ever shared a real bond. Hence, it is difficult to swallow what Helen does to find Lewis. Still, the book is worth the time as it is other-worldly."
4,the trip was fun.,I agree with a couple of the other reviews in that the ending was a bit unbelievable but the journey to get to the end was a delight. The first 50 pages WILL grab you and then you're just along for the ride and what a fun literary trip you are taken on.
4,Above Average First Effort,"This is a rather pleasing novel that started as adventure and ended in heart-tugging emotion. I don't think it's as bad as some reviewers make it out to be, but I understand the criticism, especially if you're looking for action and suspense. Those moments are rare. CURVE OF THE WORLD is really a love story portraying hope and rebirth. Helen searches for her husband, Lewis, lost in the wild jungle amidst warring primitive people in Central Africa. Both encounter personal challenges to their survival but the memories, dreams, and images of the other helps keep each alive. They each experience times when their own beliefs and values are challenged but their blind son Shane keeps them both going by his honest vision of the world.My guess is we will hear from Marcus Stevens again. Although this first novel won't break any sales records, it is thought-provoking and stylish enough to attract a faithful audience willing to read him again. I am included in that group."
2,Doesn't live up to premise,"The premise makes the book sound exciting: a businessman forced to survive in Africa after the plane he is on crashes. However, the plot doesn't live up to that, being a repeated series of hero gets lost in jungle, hero stumbles across some soldiers, hero gets away from soldiers, hero is lost in jungle again.... Meanwhile, his wife (with apparently unlimited resources) is flying back and forth across the Atlantic repeatedly in order to look for him, taking their blind son along as well.That being said, the audio version of the book is well-done, with the reader doing a good job with making all the voices distinctive and believable."
1,Curve of the World a Disappointment,"For all the hype surrounding this first novel, I expected it to be a potential Deliverance in Africa. What a disappointment. A weak plot, fleshed out by weak descriptive passages of jungle vegetation and various Third World encounters. It is especially galling to see this author beginning this appalling narrative with a quote from Naipaul. We expect more from someone who has read A Bend in the River, but then, perhaps he only read the first line. The entire thesis of the novel---a businessman crashing in the Congo, escaping from his rescuer/captors into the bush, thence searched for by his nearly estranged wife and their precocious, blind son---is so unbelieveable as to be in the final analysis merely irritating. The only way that a serious reader can finish this sophomoric tripe is to continue expecting something interesting (dialogue; plot; character development) to occur before the end. It doesn't."
3,"Interesting, but....","Steven's debut novel is interesting novel, but disappointing in it's shallowness. As a first novel I guess it is pretty good. He has a smooth story telling, which keeps the reader hooked and want to finish what he started. But the frequent flashbacks to the past slow the story considerably at times and make the reader wary. Stevens should have decided whether or not he wanted to write a novel about a failing relationship or a country in crisis( the Congo). He tried to do both and I think failed to some degree. The tragic crisis in the Congo is such that I guess only a Tolsto would have been able to do justice to the richness of culture, politics and human misery that abound there. Stevens doesn't even try to attempt doing that, and his novel comes as very shallow on the local politics and tragedy."
4,Me and my shadow,"really enjoyed this novel. the language was beautiful. mr. stevens really had me worried about his characters. his observations of africa were first hand and that brought a lot of integrity to the telling of this tale. to me, the story was about choices. sometimes the shadow chooses and we have to live out that part of the journey too."
4,Laing's Bestselling Book,"This was the book that pushed Lang into popular consciousness in the late 1960s when it was released. In it, he makes a distinction between people as sources of action and people as the seat of experience. His critique of society and the psychiatric institutions is based on the idea that at least some mental illness is actually a curative journey working to heal the sickness of the society around it. Point being that people should be treated as people, and not as things committing actions. The book is weakened by ""Bird of Paradise"" a fictional (?) chapter trying to express the thoughts of the schitzophrenic from the inside."
2,Needs links for easier reading (Good books though),"Okay, I love the two books, but the Kindle layout is HORRIBLE!! Some books have links of chapters at the beginning of the book so that you can easily find a page. This doesn't even have a link to get to the second book. Instead, you have to find the page yourself and bookmark it in order to go to it quickly later. Whoever is in charge of the Kindle edition needs to make the format/layout of the e-book a little more reader-friendly."
5,Dream of Me/Believe in Me,"This is the first book I've read since high school, which was ~10 yrs ago. I saw this book and happen to be attracted to the titles and having two books in it for the price of one. I was very drawn to the book that I could not put it down. Not even to eat. I can't believe this is Josie Litton's first romance novel. This are books with stories that will make someone want to go back in time. I'm so hooked to it. I can't wait for the next romace book from the author."
5,"Buy it now, a real keeper.","It is always so exciting when you find a new author you can enjoy. I noted another review mentioning other authors, very good authors, but Ms Litton stands well on her own. Please run out at pick up this book so you will be ready for the last enstallment at the end of the month. I can't tell you how much I appreciate the publisher introducing us to this great new voice in a double book and I feel it was the best money I've spent on a book in a long time."
4,Dream of Me,"This book was very good. I like the hero and heroine. Cymbra had substance , and so did Wolf. Boy isn't he the ideal?!!!"
2,"Very interesting book; however, way too many errors","As a fan of alternative history, I was drawn to this book by the synopsis and the previous review. The outcomes are based on historical fact and Hitler's views, including both Mein Kampf and recorded conversations.Even though I gave this book two stars, I still would recommend it.Why did I give the book two stars? Simple. There were numerous spelling, grammatical, and syntax errors, including one in a chapter titles. That is simply unacceptable, especially considering this book was not self-published. Considering that this book did or should have gone through an editor, proofreader, and the author at a minimum, this book should not have the voluminous errors that it does. I had to stop my reading to see if perhaps I had misread or not understood the wording. 99% of the time it wasn't me."
1,Too many typos,I got this book as a Christmas present for my son who is interested in WW II. He took one look at the book and handed it back to me because he didn't want to wade through the typos.
1,as User's guide can't be used as Developer's guide,"This book is Very basic. I give it 1 star. I'm returning it,It's good as user's guide can't be used as developer's guideI do recommend another book by David Sussman (Beginning Dynamic Websites with ASP.NET web matrix)"
3,It was out of date in 2007,"It was out of date in 2007, and in 2011 it is now more out of date.In its day (I got it in 97) it was fine and if you want a general overview of life in Japan it may be interesting - and especially if you get an inexpensive used copy and you are a fan of holding literature in Hard Copy. If not - I would be inclined to send you off to the internet.Again - in its day (published in 1993) it would have had a lot more value. Perhaps an update if the book is deemed as desirable to keep on the shelf?"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"I bought this item in July 2012. I gave it more than fair effort to try to make it work, but as soon as I put the headset in my ear it starts beeping... I finally contacted the manufacturer today and they told me that this item was discontinued 4-5 years ago, so It does not surprise them that the item's battery is not good anymore and it does not take a charge. So, do NOT buy it, you will probably have the same problem"
1,Product Opinion,"I'm sure this would be a great device if I had a mobile phone that would sync to it. The product description was inadequate and didn't state that the iPhone would not sync to this device. So, if you want to purchase it from me, email me c.mauldin@live.com and I'll sell it cheap.under informed buyer,C"
4,Hot Gingerbread,"Out of all of the books I read this summer ""Gingerbread"" was one of the best. Cyd Charise, a sixteen year old girl growing up in San Francisco after getting kicked out of boarding school, is known by her mother and step-father as the hellion. Cyd disagrees with her parents almost 100% of the time. Out of desperation, Cyd's mother sends her to NYC to stay with her biological father, whom she has only met once in her life. She loves her time in NYC and getting to meet her older half-brother and sister that previously did not know of her existance. The only drawback is that she misses her boyfriend back at home, did I mention her mother hates him. Will Cyd Charise ever be able to live in San Francisco again without being on the verge of WWIII with her mother?"
4,An awesome book,"I definetely recommend everybody to read Gingerbread. The book's for about 14 years old and up.Gingerbread is about a 16 year old girl named Cyd Charisse. Cyd had a doll named Gingerbread that she was given. She goes through a lot of wild adventures, including finding out that her brother is gay. Find out more...by buying the book!"
1,coffee with your ginger bread?,Book was stained with what looked like coffee and it covered the back of the back cover and the edges of every page and some on the text. Pages are still read able from that I've seen so far. The front cover looks good aside from the coffee stain in the corner and dents around the edges of the cover. No creases though. It was disappointing.
2,All right,"This story was a little vacuous. It was kind of like a sitcom-- everything ended up all right at the end. It was definetely escapist literature, there is no deeper meaning here. The author used this *really* bizarre slang as well--i'm not sure if she thought it was cool or what was going on there. all in all, i think this was lacking a little--depth."
2,Mediocre at Best,"Gingerbread seemed like an aimless book, just another indistinguishable in the mass market of publications geared toward the multi-billion dollar spending power of teenagers. I believe this book had no real plot or 'moral to the story' - I had to push myself to finish it, and didn't walk away with anything worth thinking twice about."
2,I totally expected more from this book.,"This book had no real plot, there was no climax, and it was just plain boring. I bought this book, and I regret doing so because I did not enjoy it.In this book, the main cahracter is a girl named Cyd, who I guess is punk/gothic. When Cyd's behavior gets out of control, her parents send her to live with her real dad named Frank, who she hasn't seen in about 10 years and lives in New York City. The name of this book is derived from Cyd's childhood friend, her doll Gingerbread. Although it looks like things might heat up between Cyd and her dad's employee, who is in his twenties, this does not happen, preventing anything the least bit exciting from happening."
3,I'm only doing this for homework,"The scene that I liked the most was when Cyd fell in love woth Louis. It was realli cute in a way on how Cyd flirted with him and made him attracted to her.The characters in this story...from what I think was well thought of.I have no kind of personal connection with any of these characters...none are really like me.The only thing I didn't like about this book was on how Rachel had talked about the GAY situation. The gay part just bothers me.I don't get on how gay people are accepted, like as a part of life. If I had a gay brother, i would of probably of murdered him.Cyd is a funny (well,sort of) and attractive girl."
5,gingerbread is a truly great novel,"gingerbread is a truly great novel. i think readers can relate to cyd easily, as i did. you will be addicted to this book and please please please buy ""shrimp"" once it comes out!!! funyun"
5,I loved this book!!,"Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. I'd tell myself to stop at the next chapter but I never could. I actually didn't want the book to end, I loved it so much. I loved Cyd. She drew me in and I wished I was her I liked her character so much. She was real and really amusing. I could totally relate to her since I'm a teenager and I dress the way she does and she's going through some tough crap. I just really loved the book.:p"
4,great book!!,"this book is about a 16 year old,cyd charisse, who loves to just enjoy her self and break all the rules.she doesn't care what anyone thinks and isn't afraid to tell people what's on her mind.she carries around her doll gingerbread and talks to her like she's a real person.i can understand why though because it is the onlything she has from her ""real-dad""...so yes you can call her ""bad"" or ""twisted"" but really she just wants to get to know her other side of her family.when i first read this book i really wasn't into it but i kept reading and found that i really liked it. For an adult auother i think Rachel did a great job of writing in a teen girl's point of view.i liked this book but i would have hoped for the ending to be a little longer in explaing her trip to NY to meet her father,but over all it was great: )"
2,I'm being generous,"This book just isn't worth the read. The author and the cover/reviews try to get you hooked on this book because it's about a girl who is ""different"". She isn't one of those preppy teens but that's just what she is. Cyd Charisse (main character) says that she ""isn't like them anymore"" but she's still boy-crazy and still letting guys ""play around"" with her. The story is the same old crap, a girl who wants to go and find her long-lost father but then he's not what she expected. Do yourself a favour and DONT READ THIS BOOK!"
3,"Okay, but not amazing","Gingerbread is about a smart girl by the name of Cyd Charisse. The plot is nothing speacial, she has boyfried her parents hate, gets mad at her parents, gets sent to meet her real dad, then forgives her parents. The reason this book is good is because Cyd Charisse is funny, has a great personality, and the dilouge is snappy and fun. By no means a great book, but good brain candy."
2,Could have been good,"I picked up my copy of 'Gingerbread' with the hoping that this book would be different. I was pulled in by the bondage bracelets, combat boots, and striped socks. I thought to myself, ""Hey! This person is like me!"" Instead, I got a story about an 'alternative' girl who was OF COURSE a druggy, with a 'bad' boyfriend, and all around a 'bad' girl. Why oh WHY isn't there a book out there about an alternative girl who isn't totally bad?Other than my opinion on that, I didn't find the book too interesting. Heck, about a month later (now) I've forgotten what its about! That is not good in a book!Well anyways, thank you for reading my opinionated writing. I hope that this helps you in any way."
3,Pretty cute...,"If I could have given this book three and a half stars, I would have. When I first opened ""Gingerbread,"" I had mixed feelings.... The over-the-top slang Cyd Charrise used was cute, but unrealistic and got on my nerves fast. And when her brother said he could tell right away she wasn't one of those teenyboppers, my immediate thought was, she SOUNDS like one!But in the end, ""Gingerbread"" was AOK! I loved the characters of Cyd's mother and stepfather and also her uptight-at-first sister. Cyd and her sister's first encounter was hilarious! What a way to meet your sister. Cyd's boy-obsession and words she chose to describe them were a little strange, though.All in all, ""Gingerbread"" was worth reading, but I would reccomend borrowing it from the library and not buying it!"
1,"cartridge would not fit, also printer died","the black cartridge would not fit into the correct slot in the printer. also the printer died, so I suppose it really doesn't make a difference. never had this problem before."
3,Missing Specs,"FYI, I've seen this product for sale in stores before, sold next to individually packaged #57 and #58 cartridges and I can't remember completely but I think I found that the cartridges in this combo pack have significantly less toner in them, hence the much cheaper price and the free photo paper (maybe it's only enough toner for 100 4x6's or something.) Anyway, I'm going to buy the cartridges individually from Amazon."
4,HP Cartridge & Paper Deal at Amazon,"This is great for an older HP printer. It gives you well operating cartridges, and glossy paper which makes your photos look better than professional. Best of all the PRICE IS GREAT!"
2,Looks good but.....,"Product looks good, but two different set of screws(the ones that rails screw into are too long, and lack of instructions will keep me from buying another futon online. They did send a replacement but it has exact same gear."
2,"Good concept, bad execution","I bought this journal many years ago and still have not used it. When I received it, I was disappointed in the construction and layout. While the concept is good...to help you get organized, I ended up creating my own organizer with a 3-ringed binder and inserted envelope sleeves and sheets of paper, plus tabs. It works better to put copies of your test results, research, create spreadsheets on your computer of symptoms, the date the appeared, changes, lists of your supplements and medications, etc. In addition, with the binder you can change and update information really easily and it is much cheaper to do.I didn't find the layout of this journal to be comprehensive or user friendly enough. If you really don't go to doctors much or take many supplements, then ti might be an okay journal to use. But for anyone who is really vigilant about their health the journal falls short. Plus it is just easier typing on the computer, printing out and putting it in a binder."
1,No Option,"I was about to purchase but without seeing a sample page beyond the intro I have to assume it is just blank pages. If there are pages for charting they should show them because w/o I will not purchase. Sorry, I am not doing a true review. Could not find the option for 'Questions/Comments."
1,Cannot buy due to lack of content review!!,"I currently use another Health Journal, however, I am always on the lookout for a better product! This journal might be great, however, I cannot buy it without being able to see at least the Table of Contents and a page or two of the actual journal!! Perhaps Amazon can work with the author to present this book better."
1,Digital camera,"It doesn't hold a lot of pictures and if you run out of battery power, you lose the pics you took. I got this for my son's first camera, waste of money he didn't enjoy it at all."
4,Good but disturbing for the young ones,"Wow, I finally figured out what the book was that I remember from one summer that I spent reading through the local library's science fiction section. I learned to read early and I put the skill to good use; I must have been 7 or 8 at the time. The reason why I remember the book so vividly is that it totally freaked me out in an odd way -- the book isn't really scary per se, but it kind of blew my mind at an early age with concepts I hadn't been exposed to yet... this is certainly a well-crafted story that can be used to awaken a taste for the more intellectual instead of action-oriented story, but strong yet young readers might get a few sleepless nights spent wondering at the implications of this regarding human nature; that we can be manipulated into not being so good and kind. I did in a sense lose a bit of my innocence because of this book."
3,Recommended,"I think this book would appeal most to a junior-high or high school student with an interest in sci-fi, although anyone could appreciate it. The way Sleator throws strangers together in a controlled and increasingly desperate situation is reminiscent of William Golding's Lord of the Flies. House of Stairs lacks the strong writing, characters or originality of Golding's book, but that is not to say it isn't worth reading. The story is essentially a study of operant conditioning applied to humans--what if humans were treated as the lab rats were in BF Skinner's behavior studies? I appreciate the book now with this psychological perspective, but it is certainly enjoyable and genuinely unsettling to a reader who does not have this background."
5,House of Stairs a beginning of my social/political awareness,"I think this book, with Fahrenheit 451, really brought me into a deep awareness of the importance of personal integrity - regardless of societal pressures; that those pressures are not always healthy for society, and that they can end in tragedy. I joined the school council and started volunteering. A real beginning!"
4,Pretty good reading,"I've read this book two times now, and still think it's pretty good all around. I would like to see a sequel."
4,"Intened for teens, just as effective for adults,","I read this book because the plot sounded very similar to the 1997 movie ""Cube"", a brilliant film about a group of strangers who wake up to find themselves in a huge, lethal maze. After seeing the film I instantly began looking for books with similar story lines, and William Sleator's ""House of Stairs"" fitted the bill nicely.The characters are archetypes, yes, but I still cared about them, especially the quiet, reclusive Peter.The setting of the story is one of the best elements in the book--just pristine white staircase after staircase, seemingly suspended in a equally pristine white void. The only piece of machinery is a small device that occasionally releases food--randomly at first, and as the story progresses, only when the characters are cruel to one another.And cruel they become.Highly recommended book. Short, but packs a punch. The darkly humorous ending is a kick too!"
1,Horrible,"I decided to read William Sleator's young adult science fiction novel House of Stairs after reading an interesting description in the LibraryThing Group ""Name That Book."" However, the individual looking for the title of the book described a far more compelling novel than I found Sleator's book to be. The plot and characters are as static as the environment in which they are thrust, and reading the book through to the end seemed almost as mentally difficult as the ""physical challenges"" the teenagers faced. So little is actually interesting that the novel is beyond intellectual redemption, and it is a tremendous relief to have finished it. I can't think of a single individual or ""type"" to whom I would recommend this little disaster."
1,not my cup of tea,"I found this book to be rather bothersome. While the concept of the ideas was entirely interesting, to me, the actual writing itself left something to be desired. I can appreciate the subject matter, but would never read this book again."
2,An Adult Review,"I really enjoyed Sleator's ""Singularity"" and ""Instellar Pig"" when I was younger. Every year, I pick up a young adult book or two to read through. I chose this one because of the mostly glowing reviews and the premise sounded interesting. What I found instead was a page-turner that was boring. Nothing really happens in this book. Yes, it can lead to a good discussion about survival, almost Lord Of The Flies like. But the ending seemed forced and kind of cheap and predictable. None of the characters were likeable. And there was way too much language for a young adult book (ie. the GD word was used a lot), so buyer beware. Very disappointed, but I will survive."
2,An unrealistic novel...,"In my opinion the novel ""House of Stairs is nice although it isn't realistic that an experiment like that could happen in reality. It is well structured and easy to understand. Furthermore it has a nice ending. But the credibility of the characters is as bad as the tension. So all in all it's a nice but also a very unrealistic novel."
2,House of Stairs,"Imagine being blindfolded, placed on an elevator, and shipped to a strange place. When you got there, the place is filled with only stairs. There is no ceiling, no floor, and no walls. That is exactly the situation five 16-year-old orphans' find themselves in, in the book House of Stairs by William Sleator. The five teens must learn ways to survive and obtain food in a special way. Their only food source is a red machine, which will only supply them with food if they demonstrate a series of complex movements, like a dance, that pleases the machine. None of the teens know where they are, how they got there, or why they are there. This book deals with cooperation, strength, and teamwork. I would rate this book two and a half stars because it wasn't a very interesting book. It didn't hold my attention or keep me focused on the main point of the story. It also seemed to have a lot of repetition. However, the author showed a creative story plot with a surprising ending."
3,Average for the illustrations,"Unlike the other reviewers I don't care much for this book on Sargent. Perhaps it's because I only bought the book for the illustrations and could care less for the text and essays. That said, it's a large thick book with a fair number of illustrations, but most are smaller in size and I'm very disappointed with the paintings represented. With regard to size, quality, and selection of illustrations I'm far happier with the book by Kate F. Jennings ( ISBN 1572153415 )."
5,This book radically woke me up to where we are.,If you ever purchased a book other than the Holy Bible....purchase this one. It will tear down all those sacred cows of religion and give you the truth. It is a last warning...and I do mean a last warning to escape the wrath coming upon the Earth.
5,A great step by step guide to Bible prophecy.,"This book dares to talk about topics which are skipped over by most Bible scholars. Charles Capps' supports his views very well with scripture. I would encourage any and all seekers of the Truth to read the Bible first, read this book second!"
4,"Very good, not for the new believer...",I really wanted to give this book 5 stars with every1 else but felt the author should have prepared his readers with the fact LOTS of info was to b covered. I'll have 2 read this book 2 or 3 times before I can say I totally understand the authors theories and insight. LOTS of cross-refrencing and math here I would not recomend this book for the new believer as the person would only get confused with information overload. I do feel it's a GREAT book but will have to read it 2 or 3 more times to really get it.
3,"Broken, Social, and Ecclectic","Just like another great current Canadian group The New Pornographers, Broken Social Scene is collective of musicians, but unlike the first which strives to create perfect pop/rock...Broken Social Scene takes strands of different musical elements; occasionally fusing them together, while occasionally concentrating on one part of the musical palate. This is indie rock at it's most ecclectic, at it's most creative. Broken Social Scene combines elements of orchestral pop, eg, strings and unconventional structures, with the approach/experimentalism of post-rock, eg, Gastr Del Sol. But stopping just short Jim O'Rourke, somewhere along the line Broken Social Scene realized the power of good 'ol indie-rock was too influential to deny, and decided to throw that into the mix as well. 'You Forgot It In People' is experimental enough where it grabs your attention, energetic enough where you can increase the volume levels and toe-tap away."
2,Metric Does It WAY Better...,"Im sorry for all the B.S.S. fans (if there is any) but Id have to say this is one of the worst CDS in my collection ... it really surprised me when I heard this cd knowing it was some members of Metric. To hear how much they sucked made it a pretty bad experience. Dont get me wrong Metric is probably one of the top 5 in my CD collection, but I have been really disappointed. Like I said METRIC does it WAY BETTER! ... GO BUY THE METRIC CD!"
2,Avante garde overkill,This album has nothing to grasp onto. It's so aloof that it almost feels insulting listening to it. I don't understand the appeal.
1,Copy-Controlled Over-rated Nonsense,"Broken Social Scene care so little about their fans that they agreed to release this record in EMI's ""copy control"" disc format, instead of a real compact disc. These discs are inferior to real CDs, disallow a customer's fair use of the purchased music in portable players and car stereos, and often do not play at all in some home stereo systems. I highly encourage you to spend your money on something other than this overhyped bland indie rock BS."
1,Just Plain Broken,"1.) Arrangements relies too much on effects, not musically challenging or that interesting.2.) Background ambient instrumentals are to imposing, they over power the main structure.3.) Lyrically unsound and ridiculous."
1,Uninspired...,"Just because Rolling Stone liked the album doesn't mean you have to. Do yourself a favor and buy ""Hail to the Thief"" instead. Just because bands like Radiohead and Sigur Ros have been quite successful making experimental pop music, less talented bands feel like they have the excuse to create meandering experimental records. As for this, there is no excuse, simply another dull indie band trying to ride on the coat tails of true musical revolutionaries."
5,great ! something original at last !,"i bought this cd after i read the great reviews on the internet. it doesn't hit you in the first listen but it grows on you the more you listen. my favs include KC Accidental, Stars And Sons, Anthems For A 17 year Old Girl, Cause=Time and Lover's Spit. the production is incredible . you have to get this cd. (get the raveonettes-chain gang of love too :)"
5,canada gave us something even better than shania twain,"five stars...for one song alone. that song is anthems for a seventeen year old girl. anthems is a heartfelt ballad featuring the mother of jesus herself...emily haines. before you call me sacrilegious...listen to the hip tune. listen to it once...and you find the song to be a little curious but won't understand the hype. a second time, you'll find it sort of interesting but will find the vocal effects distracting. you will listen again..and again. it will be absorbed into your bloodstream...and become associated with memories. it's like walking home alone and looking at the stars. it's like they made nostalgia but in the form of a song. it's the sad yearning of youth...perfectly captured."
5,It's almost a crime...,"that anyone would rate this below a 5!!!! I understand some people's frustration at more mellow tracks like ""Looks Just Like The Sun"" but sheesh...the stronger tracks are REALLY strong. and the ""okay"" ones are pretty good, infinitely better than other groups' throwaway tracks. (In my opinion, the ""bad"" songs on here are much better than the ""bad"" songs on Hail To The Thief, and I am a much bigger Radiohead fan than a BSS one...)Listen to this album with an open mind."
5,indiana has been blessed,"I have had the wonderful privilege of seeing this band perform twice in Indiana. The cd is great of course, but seeing them live marks them as my favorite band right now. They are a joy to watch and its apparent they love what they're doing. Jason Collett and Metric were two of the best opening acts i've ever seen. So please support this band on their unfortunately brief U.S. tour."
5,Yep.. this is good.,"Yes, this is good. I like 'Lost Souls' by the Doves too, but haven't gotten 'Last Broadcast' b/c it sounded a little poppy to me at first. So that's where I am coming from. This album has energy to it, but is thoughtful and doesn't play on many of the cliche-ness that's going around right now.I guess I also like it becuase it's not about the whole 'back to the 80's thing' that's going around right now. It's refreshing then albums like this can come out and at least provide music in 2004 that sounds like it should be in 2004."
4,A strong album,"Pitchfork gave this a 9.2.....I wouldn't agree. Its definitel good, and among some of the best of 2003 but not a 9.2. There are definitely low points such as the first track, and im sorry but Almost Crimes is not that good of a song. But. Cause=Time, Pacific Theme, and Lover's Spit have become some of my all time favorites songs. BSS is one creative band. With 11 peopel i think there's nothing they can't do. They have taken instrumental (er mostly instrumental) music to another level. I love this album but it's not as great as some of you think."
3,Help me out,"Help me out someone!? I have a wide experience of listening to every kind of (alternative) music but I really cannot see the greatness of the album. Sure, it sounds great and there are great moment but it didn't get me like the Arcade Fire, Bloc Party or even Stars, of which there are some members in BSS as well.There are shards of 'Daydream Nation', a little Interpol (ok, before their albums came out), some more Sonic Youth feedback and Pavement madness and a blatant Dinosaur Jr ripoff (cause = time). I'm sure I will listen to it more and maybe one day the coin will drop when I got through the sometimes hard songs and uninspiring vocals. But for now... I've had better"
2,Not as good as I expected,"There was a whole lot of hype surrounding this album which may have made my expectations too high, but I saw nothing special about this cd. I think there are only 2 or 3 songs worth listening to and everything else was weirdly experimental and completely random. With ""Anthems for a 17 year old girl"" and ""Lover's Spit"" they showed a lot of potential, these are two really good songs, but not much more worth listening to on the cd. Or maybe I just don't ""get it."" Either way, 2 stars."
2,Metric does it better,"Metric does it better. Emily Haines and James Shaw are also in a much better and more fleshed out band called Metric who are way better than this stuff. She does all the singing so if you like Anthem For a 17 Yr old Girl it would be the worst song on ""Old world Underground"", Metric's debut. Buy Metric, because this just doesnt cut it at all and I really don't understand all the hype. I finally gave in after seeing it on every top five list next to the Wrens and Ted Leo and stuff, but wow. I guess I must be the one on crazy pills, Huh? BUY METRIC- They do everything this band does only better! (I really did try to find the hype, I just cant!)"
2,"some good, some just bites","a couple of good tunes here, showing some interesting avenues of notes but some tunes just bore me into skip modes..i think they take themselves a bit too serious when they get on a repetitive trip of bland and stalled circles...i was also at the Barcelona show and their '"" improve your kitchen"" comment put many goers off..i left thinking "" take some of your canadian bacon and stuff it up your chute""ignorance and arrogance is a dangerous combo..."
4,Modestly ambitious,"One of those rare indie albums that is actually deserving of so many splendid reviews. Excellently eclectic alternative pop with hardly any downtime (although I would have liked to have seen a more triumphant final stretch) and only a few sonic indulgences without payoff. Even with much of the deceptively simple arrangements, the lo-fi density of this thing fleshes even the most fickle melody into an almost orchestral and fractured glory."
2,I really wanted to like this cd....,"I've been a fan of Lou Reeds for a long time. I've seen him in concert three or four times and I do appreciate his storytelling style.In listening to this CD, I simply wasn't impressed. Vicious, which was always more a parody to me than serious, sounded pretentious. Dirty Boulevard was rushed...the very musicality of the whole concert seemed lackluster. If I was at the show that night, I would have though Reed was having a serious off-night.Using an online radio service, I heard a version of Perfect Day (a wonderful Velvet Underground song, one of my favorites) that I wanted to own. I clicked on buy this album and this was the one it directed me to. Not the same version, but it is still the best song on this CD.Hope this helps..."
2,"It has its moments, but very few of them.","Remember when Lou Reed was great? And when he actually sang? This live collection is a disappointing document of Reed's current live show--and a blatant attempt to cash in (late, as usual) on the ""unplugged"" trend. Some of the tunes, like ""Kicks"" and ""Coney Island Baby"" are wonderful to hear again, but the butchering of ""Vicious"", is very hard to stomach. The vocal delivery is so stuttering and off-handed (even for Lou), it makes you wonder if the guy has forgotten the lyrics. Move over, David Bowie--here comes another once-great has-been."
3,"An okay live album from Lou Reed,.","Perfect Nigh: Live in London was a live album that Lou Reed made during some down time he had before his next disc.Nothing ground breaking, just Lou Reed and his band going through some old tunes infront of a live audience in England. Nothing to write home about. A nice tight performance from Lou and company.Recommended for Lou Reed fans."
5,Skates,"Bought this item on Amazon,It was an excellent price,good quality,shipping was fast,Grandaughter really likes them and say they are very comfortable. Overall experience with this product is excellent. would recommend to all that need a reasonably priced Skate."
1,never received it,"I ordered the watch, but never received it. It was sent ""signed receipt"". I was not aware of that contingency when I ordered it. I called FedEx when I received the first notice at the door that they had attempted to drop it off. I asked them to drop it off without a signature. They told me it was at the request of the seller. I told them that I paid for it and would assume the risk. There would be no one home all week at the time they stop by. My request was ignored....they wasted there time by knocking on my door 2 more times, only to find no one home and sent the watch back. I emailed Amazon, which linked me to the undisclosed seller and was asked them to please ship it back no signature required. They told me to order it again. My problem, is that the signed receipt requirement was not disclosed clearly during the order process. If so, I would have had it shipped to my business address."
4,Great Lens But..........,"All I can say is that everything written in the other reviews is true - it is one great performing and versatile lens. But be aware it is one heavy dumb bell, and you need to be just about a pro to put up with it. You'll be tired from carrying the thing after a two or three hour photographic shoot if not before.However I guess we should have known that beforehand shouldn't we - the lens is (obviously) professionally built made of metal, and has more glass in it than a medium size window pane. You don't get this kind of versatility otherwise."
5,Best all-around lens for DSLR video,"This lens is very versatile for video shoots with lots of action. I work at Jordan Winery [...] and spend a fair amount of time shooting video of vineyard crews pruning grapevines and harvesting grapes. There's a lot of movement and this lens helps me get all kinds of different shots fast without changing lenses. It's the best all-purpose lens Canon makes, IMO. I've researched them all, as has my husband who is a professional photographer. Highly recommended. The only complaint I have is that the collar slips quite often, so if you're shooting video, make sure to get a level to put on your camera or use an iPhone level app -- or just go out and buy the new Canon 5D Mark iii, which has a built-in level."
5,Nikon 28-300mm F 3.5- 5.6L IS USM lens,"All in one lens.I do not need to change lenses very often. This one is the one I need.It's a little bit heavy, though!Excellent Canon product."
4,Great Resources,"I would highly recommend this book. It is well written, funny and very helpful. The book was recommended to us at a time when we were concerned about one of our dogs and the principles outlined in the book were extremely helpful. A great resource!!"
5,Essential to any comprehensive ethnic issues collection,"David Hillard and Lewis Cole's This Side Of Glory (1-55652-384-X, $18.95) provides the autobiography of Hillard and his involvement with the Black Panther Party. The Party's history, focus, and events are revealed in this eyewitness account. Essential to any comprehensive ethnic issues collection."
3,Tip,I'm not sure if I'm using this right. Ive always used tools all my life so I believe I'm doing it the right way. I just can't really tell a difference from before and after.
1,Poor contact design,"I received this product promptly but the good news ended there. I charged one battery and then inserted a second battery and one of the metal contacts broke and that was the end of its usefulness.You get what you pay for so buyer beware. Amazon, pull this product from you inventory list. It diminishes your product line."
2,Cheap like the budget,"If you want a battery that only works if you plug it in holding your mouth the right way while standing on one leg, then this is the product for you. Otherwise, don't waste your $10 on this and try another brand. You pay for what you get."
5,Best One Yet!,"I have been using Leslie Sansone for about 5 years. This is by far the best one yet. Great new walkers, can hear the music really well, and she stays on topic."
5,A+++ Sale,"I love Leslie's work out tapes and own numerous. I have lost over 20 lbs using her tapes along with a sensible diet. I feel they are the best walking work out tapes on the market and any age, fitness and energy level can benefit from them."
5,love leslie,"I ordered this dvd and love it. I have been doing WATP for many years, in fact i still do the video cassettes that i got years ago. I have two words for Leslie...""love her"". I work out every day and use many different DVDs, but I always come back to Leslie. I just turned 59 and as I get older, I realize I can't jump that much any more, but I can still move my legs and walking is what I need. I am totally advanced so i add a lot of jogging and other moves, i also incorporate 3 lb dumb bells and 2 lb ankle weights to get some great strength training. I can work in 2 or 3 miles in everyday, before going to work. I just get up a little earlier. I am addicted to Leslie Sansone WATP."
4,"Better than ok, but....","I own quite a few Leslie dvds. This one while being a bit different, does give you a great workout. The music is better on this one, but her walkers aren't the same, doesn't make it as fun as her others. I don't like how the miles get broken up, and her ""toning sessions"" last about 3 whole minutes. I do love Leslie though, and I know a lot of people comment on her chatter, but I like that. Her cheerful disposition makes it fun. On this one she doesn't talk so much, which doesn't make it as fun. But she does incorporate some new moves and you get a great workout from it."
2,Boring,Leslie needs new music. It's monotonous and can hardly be heard above her voice. Every mile is the same beat. Nothing changes. I have the 3 mile DVD and will go back to that. Don't waste your money on the 5 Day Walk Plan.
1,Total Let Down,"So I been waiting on this DVD like forever. A total Flop! The execution is aweful. So she has 3 miles 4 miles 1 mile 2 miles and 5 miles. The problem is that after you finish one mile and your heart rate is up the next mile starts off slow as if you are just starting out. This is my third Leslie DVD. Her five day slim down is way better cause its five individual miles but they transition into each other meaning you just gonna go faster til five. So you can just do one or go all the way to five with your heart rate staying up.I also have her 1&2 mile which I love. Two more things. The tonining sessions or should I say what toning session....less than five mins. Last point, Leslie has a face full of make up and a snooky hump, so not cool. Glad i only paid 8 bucks. Will be selling it for 5 at my yardsale on saturday, totally a waste of money and space."
2,Save your money,"This is not for advanced walkers. What you get is series of 1 mile walks that are not very challenging, Leslie does noteven break a sweat. Save your money on this one."
1,HAVE NOT DONE THIS ONE YET,I bought this DVD today and now I'm afraid to open it cause I bought another one Walk Slim 5 Really Big Miles and hated it. I'm 63 yrs old and her walkers are all young enough to be my grandchildren. She goes too fast and does not announce what is coming up next until she is almost doing it. I have her old DVDs and I love those. She has people my age in them and that's much better for me. I'm in pretty good shape for my age but don't want to feel like a grandmother while exercising. I did not enjoy the music either and I love all kinds of music including some hip hop. I guess I will not be able to take it back cause it is already opened. So I wasted my money. Will not be doing this again. :(
1,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Leslie for a while. I have several of her videos. This one has a warm-up before each mile, and it doesn't tell you anywhere how much time each days' walk will take. The music is just plain dull. Get Five Fast Miles it is the best. Also the participants are too much like models than real women. Too bad."
5,No more excuses!,"I have several Leslie DVD's, but was looking for a change. I absolutely love this one!! She has given you your choice of 5 pre-programmed sessions OR you can easily create your own. Simply choose between different 'color coded' walks and an array of short sessions including abs, legs, arms, warm up, cool down, etc. This DVD offers a new and fresh cast of walkers, an updated studio backdrop, new upbeat music and clear step-by-step instructions. This is not a leisurely stroll, but more of a walking aerobic workout. Prepare to break a pleasant sweat! Get off that couch and get moving :)"
2,not what I'd hoped,"I was really excited to get this dvd so I could do a different workout each day. There are 5 different miles on thisbut that's just it, 5 DIFFERENT MILES! Whatever day you pick, it just mixes them together. So you really get going and then have to wait in neutral after the first mile is done for the next one to pick up. Each mile is a great workout, but I prefer her 2, 3, and 4 mile walks that are all done in one session."
3,A few new things,"I found the DVD ok, but not for an advanced walker. It is slow moving and I have to use a weighed belt to add some resistance. I found it a pain that when you choose the 5 miles which is what I do that you then have to go back to each mile so you can do the extras that come with this DVD - time consuming. A few new moves and music, but much the same in general. I wish we could have 1 DVD where we could do 5 miles or more without having to warm up and cool down every mile as again I have to advance the DVD and by pass the warmups/cool downs for each mile while I keep jumping around to keep my heart rate up."
5,GREAT TO HAVE DAILY CHOICES - WAY TO GO!,I have been a great follower of Leslie Sansone's walks for many years. This new one is great because it is different every day! You can also personalize what you are looking to walk on a daily basis.Wish there was the no talk version though.
5,Exercise for the uncoordinated,"I love to walk and I love this DVD. There are only five basic movements; a walk, a kick, a knee lift, a tap and a side step. Each step is demonstrated first before a rep begins to give you the chance to get in step. Hand movements are added in the same way, demonstration first, then into the rep. With the warm up and a 1 mile you will have done 15 minutes of exercise which feels like an achivement if you are new to exercising, you won't notice the time passing! Leslie is not like other trainers, her people look happy, she is supportive in her language and they aren't all super skinny gym junkies pushing for a burn - they actually look like they're having fun! Can't recommend this highly enough. Plus, with workouts broken in to 1 mile sessions you can stop after one or two and not feel like you've only done half a session! After only three days I can feel the difference on my walk to work in the morning."
