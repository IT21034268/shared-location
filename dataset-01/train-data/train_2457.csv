5,"A solid, solid debut...","After checking out the Hocus Pocus video on MTV, a pumped-up version of the '70s classic, I was hooked on this guy. This album covers the spectrum of rock, from the hard-driving opening ""Mass Hysteria"" to the subtle groove of ""Bert's Lounge"" to the soaring blues of ""Texas Son"" to the the mellow tones of ""Motown Fever"" to the blissfully sad ""Fade to Blue"" to the Satriani-like cruising tune, ""Drive"" and a few others. I've had this album for over five years and it hasn't lost its luster a bit. It's all instrumental, so if you love guitar music, there's another hero on the scene. Scoop this one up, you hear?"
4,Nice mixture of styles,"I like how this guy blends the Satch tone with edgey blues-rock and 70's metal. I think this blend makes him pretty unique, rather than ""not bringing anything new to the table"". After the first few seconds of listening, it sounded new to me, and I've listened to just about every artist and style of music you can imagine. The X Factor is that part of the music that makes you want to get up and rock the hell out. This album has it."
3,"overall, good cd","some of the songs are a little too loud, but overall the cd is good (just skip like 3 of the songs)"
1,The Kenny G of guitar players,"I agree with the first guy.To the casual non guitar playing listener this guy might sound great.This guy is a good player no doubt about it,but his style is so by the book it's not even funny.He needs to get off that whah whah pedal and quit doing cheesy instramental covers.Why should I like Xmas songs just because it's played on a guitar?So I can play it for the family at Xmas and say isn't this cool!The local rock radio station here in San Diego kisses this guy a** calling him a guitar god.Not even close!You need to pay your dues first,get a track record in some good bands etc.Instramental guitar has been done to death.Shrapnel records put out the best guitar stuff in the 1980's.If you like novelty guitar playing this is your guy.If you want to get serious check out Jason Becker,Steve Vai,Uli Jon Roth/old Scorpions,Michael Schenker,Tony Macalpine,and Vinnie Moore.This guy should stick to giving lessons."
3,Missing the 'x' factor,"As with all second division shredders, there's nothing wrong with Hoey's technical proficiency. It's just they dont bring anything new to the party. If guitar instrumental rock's your thing, there is no one better than Satch. No one else has produced anything as diverse as 'Flying...' or as groundbreaking as 'Surfing..'. Vai runs him a close second. He has the chops but hasnt produced such as consistently high quality of work. Back to Hoey. Satch's influence is clear but there's that 'x' factor missing, in way that Andie Macdowell's good looking but just not sexy."
1,never recieved,I have contacted Amazon about shipping this item. They replyed that it was shipped but I have never received it. Amazon refuses to follow up and will not ship a repalcement. They are also refusing to submit a refund. Way to be a representative business. Real up standing. Anything that has Amazon associated with it will never get my business.
3,Not for the Masses...,"Very few people will understand or appreciate this CD. Lots of the psychedelic, tons of distortion, and often just blaitant noise abound this journey into the world of the Flaming Lips. Wayne Coyne is either weird, brave, or both. Once you enter Flaming Lips fandom there is no escape! Buy this Cd if you're in a freaky mood, but don't listen to it as soon as that feeling wears off! You'll wonder how in the Hell this Cd ended up in your collection. This album is definitely not for the masses (none of their albums are), but there are two great singles on it...and sometimes I buy CDs for a couple good songs. ""She Don't Use Jelly"" was an MTV Buzz Clip awhile ago, and I loved the song. ""Turn It On"" and ""Superhumans"" are also pretty sweet...in a screwed up way. --DMM"
5,You Can't Go Wrong with this!!!,"Granted, Flaming Lips are an acquired taste. But what a taste! There haven't been vocals this squirrely since the early days of Meat Puppets. This album is a pure trip. ""Turn it On"" is a rock and roll call-to-arms in a vein worthy of KISS, but with an undertone of late 60s garage rock. When they sing, ""Turn it on, in your houses when you wake up, turn it on,"" they MEAN it. Yeah, ""She Don't Use Jelly"" is on this album, but it's not the highlight. The whole thing has an other-wordly feel. If you want to hear something off the wall, but with pop sensibility, listen to this."
4,Very Diverse and Interesting Album,"This album has one of the widest collections of sounds that I have heard on any album. Of course it has the great song ""She Don't Use Jelly"" which will make you laugh, but ""Turn It On"" and ""Chewin' The Apple Of Your Eye"" are great songs as well with lyrics that really catch in your head and make you think a little to really work them out. Reminding me at times of the off-the-wall lyrics of They Might Be Giants, but not quite so zany and with a better sound behind them, this band is definitely interesting and worth a listen. I highly reccomend this album, it will grow on you."
3,Fairly standard early-90's fare from a truly inventive band,"Distorted guitars and early 90's dynamics (LOUD-quiet-LOUD) make Transmissions from the Satellite Heart sound dated. Although the album often has some crazy instrumentation that makes it stand out, these touches are usually attached to sludgy guitars while Wayne's especially thin sounding vocals bleat out uninteresting melodies. If you enjoy the later Flaming Lips for their simple, compelling melodies and over-the-top instrumentation, this album could disappoint."
4,sonic density and elephant ears,"This album is:1) More unnerving than a busload of homosexual hypnotists.2) Not produced by Phil Spector3) The musical rendition of 'dueling cheese-graters.'Of course, you simply mustn't take my recommendation as such, and should immediately purchase the cd, along with a half pound of gouda."
2,I'm really confused,"I bought this CD many years ago after seeing part of the ""She don't use Jelly"" during a Beavis and Butthead episode. I thought that it was a silly but cool sounding song. I probably played that song a few times and then the CD made it to the bottom of the pile for several years. Today I found it again while I was going through my music collection and decided to give it a spin. Honestly... I hated it! All the songs sounded so juvenile, under produced, predictable and... just terrible...I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you want to explore this band, I highly recommend that you first download a song or two or listen to the samples here. If for some weird reason that I don't understand, you like them, then by all means buy the CD and support these artists.I, for one, just don't get it...."
2,Lips have done better...,"As a huge Lips fan, i can easily say that this is not the band at their best. It has She Don't Use Jelly, and a few other great songs (my favourite is Pilot Can) but most of these songs seem to get old and boring very quickly. For the best early 90's Lips experience, get Future Head or Priest Driven Ambulance."
5,So Good It's Ridiculous,"The Flaming Lips are, and have always been, American originals. This LP is no exception: it's noisy, goofy, strange, catchy, unpredictable and thoroughly entertaining. In short, I'd say this is arguably their very best, and they've made so many great records I'd simply advise the casual fan to listen to them all, but to start with this one.""Turn it On"" is pop genius and reason enough to purchase the entire album. As for the rest, they're all totally timeless and unique. For many, the ""Yoshimi"" LP was their first taste of the Flaming Lips. If you liked that one, buy this next. Then maybe go for ""The Soft Bulletin"". I've owned this LP since the early nineties and I find that I still go to it once a week or so--if that's not an indication of how great this record is, I don't know what is."
4,Pretty good,"This book is not all I expected, but being the 'seeing eye person' for a dog whose sight left him eighteen months ago, dogamine and I had had time to adjust and learn a lot before receiving the book. All in all, basically pretty good."
5,"Love this book, well written, great information.","For those of us who are thrust into the position of owning a dog who has gone blind, this book is for you. It has valuable medical information, essential emotional support, and pertinent information to help make the proper diagnosis for your dog, and treatment options for this devastating condition. As an owner of a blind 2yr. old German Shepherd, I can assure you that life with a blind dog can be remarkable and happy. This well written book is a 'must read' for all those who have blind, or vision impaired dogs and are trying to cope with this condition. You won't regret getting this wonderful, inclusive book."
5,Friendly rebuttal to previous reviewer,"I have read this book and felt compelled to respond to comments in the review below.This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog with vision problems. It *is* available directly from the publisher.In the beginning of the book, there is a section that explains how many people experience strong feelings of grief when their dog is diagnosed blind. It explains that one of the most common reactions is anger. This book will help both the dog and dog owner adjust to the best quality of life possible."
3,Pack dogs,"I didn't find this book to be very helpful. It seems to be geared to having a pack of dogs as opposed to a single dog.Either my dog is incredibly bright (okay, he is) or the book implies that dogs need far more training than I have found it to be for my dog.My dog is completely blind. It happened over a period of a couple of months. He does very well at home and away and does not require all the aids the book suggests a blind dog might need."
2,Not Impressed,Ordered this book on recommendations here... Am not impressed at all...Could be much better with more practical information.
4,Blind Dog,"My dog was recently diagnosed with SARDS, and I bought this book on the recommendation of the specialty vet who diagnosed her. The only useful parts of the book are the sections on household tips to make sure that your dog is safe, and some of the training suggestions."
5,Very insightful,"Great book. Luckily my dog was 9 years old when he developed retinal degeneration. But if you were to adopt or have a blind dog from the start, this book teaches you how to help your dog have a full life as though he could see. It also has helpful pointers and suggestions. The medical jargin is a little wordy, but it's very through about the supposed causes of why your dog is blind or going blind. Very helpful."
4,Understanding for blind dogs.,It was very enlightening. There is hope for dogs and their owners to live a good quality of life. The book was encouraging in this aspect. It was compassionately written.
5,One in a million,"I was devastated when my dog lost her vision. This book has helped me cope, given me reassurance and helped my dog enjoy life again. A must read for someone with a visually challenged pet."
4,90% happy,"I am extremely happy with this book. Most of the training techniques I found to be very good and have already put them into practice. The only thing I found that concerned me was the use of a prong collar. There are much more humane ways to manage a large dog, eg a harness where the lead comes from under the chin."
4,Help for Living With A Blind Dog,"My beloved English Springer Spaniel was attacked by SARDS (Sudden Acquired Retinal Degeneration Syndrome). Despite efforts to arrest this virus, Nellie went blind. For two weeks, I didn't know how to take care of her or what to do. I was told about this book and ordered it immediately. When it arrived, I devoured every page and found hope with living with a blind dog. After instituting a lot of tricks, tips and advice, we are learning with each day and it is getting much easier. Nellie is now getting around much better and is her old self again. Thank you for writing this important book for those with blind dogs."
5,Excellent resource,"My senior dog recently lost most of her vision. This book is excellent in providing ideas that work to help her navigate in the house, down the stairs and outside. The rug at the top and bottom of the steps helps her find her way and the scents added to certain door frames allowed her to find her way in and out of rooms without bumping her head or causing panic. I recommend this book to anyone who has blind or sight impaired animals."
1,Bad training advice!,Chapters 2-4 were ok after that trash the book.No matter when/how you got your blind dog do not be harsh with the dog or other ones youmight have that don't understand why she/he can't play like before.Gentle training praise and reward blind or sighted always works.Love you new dog but trash this book.
4,Living with blind dogs.,There is not alot of information on the subject of living with blind dogs. This gives some practical how to's. Owner's of blind dogs share their real life experiences.
4,Great help,"My doggie...more like my child, suddenly went blind. After seeing multiple vets, nothing could be done to help her. She, and I, were both depressed. This book helped so much to give me some hints on how to adapt to life with a blind dog. Today, I can say, that life is easier and we both are adjusting to her situation. And, she remains my very special doggie who just needs a little more help than before. Thanks so much."
4,Book for handling blind dogs,This book is very helpful for me in training my blind Pekingese. I've gotten several good ideas from it.
4,A near-perfect follow-up to his glorious debut album.,"While not as powerful or intoxicating as his timeless debut albu, this was a great follow-up. ""Stay In My Corner"" and ""Let Me Make Love To You"" are simply superb. Given his enormous talent, it's almost unbelievanle that Keith Washington is not better known."
4,Silky smooth love songs,"The best songs here are Let Me Make Love To You (a duet with Letitia Body), Stay In My Corner and the title track, all three of them romantic love songs. Although the sound is slightly dated in its early 1990s R&B groove, it remains a pleasant listening experience on account of Washington's appealing voice and the tuneful material. Before I Let Go is a rhythmic, uptempo number and the Trippin' will also set your foot a tapping. There are also lovely emotional ballads like Do What You Like, No One and Believe That. The vocals, production and arrangements are perfect. If you like smooth soul and R&B, Keith's your man and this album delivers the goodies."
3,"Good followup, but the first one is better","Keith made a very good second album. But something is missing here. A few of the ballads lack passion. The Gerald Levert-produced songs are nowhere near the quality of Nettlesby and Coffey's songs that are on here and on his debut. I still like Stay in My Corner and the title song, but nothing matches the debut. I don't listen to this album as much as album 1 or album 3 by him."
3,Works but watch out for battery holder,"Unit works fine but plastic tab that covers battery broke within first month, sensitivity takes trial and error, very handy"
5,Great&solid,i really dig the versatality of this group.this multi-set is a must.the words&music are solid.i've been digging this group for years.
2,i waste my money,"because I thought it would be much better. It was disappointing, really. I don't understand the good reviews here. 5 o 6 tracks are good enough, including La bamba y Come on Let's go, plus some traditional Mexican tunes, as Carabina 30 30 and Volver, but all the rest is far from been interesting, they bore and ask for skip. My impression is that they could be much more than they really achieve. They've got something (that something that made me buy the album) but they fail and never get to a great thing. I guess the fans will enjoy this collection, but casual listeners: be aware. Prometen más de lo que cumplen"
5,"Awesome Design, Great Value","Love it. I have a 17.5"" neck and, I am a male. I was looking for a product that was distinct and humble - this is it! The seller is great too."
2,Good for the price.,"Just your basic practice bolts for crossbow. Good product for the price though. Would buy more just they are not top notch, just for practice."
3,decent pistol crossbow bolts,these are small bolts for a pistol cross bow if you get them for riffels they could kill the person firng them so becarefull.
3,I hate this book,"I have this book and another on for my class. This book is hard to read, and thats bad considering I have to read it."
2,End of the road,"In my opinion, ""UK Jive"" is the second-worst Kinks album after ""Misfits."" The only song here that hints at Ray Davies' genius is the sturdy, melodic ""How Do I Get Close."" Aside from that track, Ray offers mostly off-putting heavy rock (""Aggravation,"" ""Entertainment"") and bland attempts at radio anthems (""Down All the Days,"" ""Now and Then""). Almost without exception his lyrics are sour, cumbersome, one-note attacks on predictable targets (big business, politicians, the media... yawn). The band plays the airless arrangements like bored session men.Dave Davies' three contributions, tacked on at album's end, offer a welcome respite, especially the energetic ""Bright Lights.""Even in the context of their hit-or-miss late career, ""UK Jive"" is a remarkably poor showing from the Kinks, with only two or three decent tracks to recommend it. Make this one of your last Kinks purchases."
2,Shucks,"This was near the end of the road for the Kinks and should be near the end of your Kinks purchases. Being the Kinks, it's guaranteed to have its moments but ""UK Jive"" doesn't hold up next to most of the rest of the catalog. The title track is the catchy number that will wind up on future compilations, as will the lead track ""Aggravation"", reminiscent of moments from the Low Budget album. The back half of the album will probably only get a couple spins in your player.All in all a little overproduced, perhaps in an attempt to put a sheen on a labor of work. The general feeling tends to be that of a journeyman band putting out a professional effort that can't go too wrong but aches with a sense of rote. ""To The Bone"", ""Think Visual"", or Ray's solo album ""The Storyteller"" are much better CDs from this general era. The latter is particularly recommended."
4,crazy,An excellent look into a world many people have no idea was there. How those considered to be insane were treated is revealed here and is an eye opener. Good reference.
4,An Important But Neglected Chapter in History,"This book gives insight into a frightening aspect of American history: the eugenics movement. While most people equate this term with Nazi Germany, it existed in the US in the form of warehousing children based on dubious IQ tests, and subjecting them to involuntary sterilization, lobotomy, and dangerous experiments. The motivation for these practices was the hope that ""substandard"" people would not reproduce, and allow Americans to become ""the master race."" While the author's style is a little disjointed for my taste, the content is chilling mostly because it is factual. Having been to the grounds of the Fernald School several times, I can still feel the anguish those children experienced echoing between the condemned buildings."
4,LIKE IT BUT.,"MY HUSBAND AND I LIKE THIS SALT VERY MUCH, IT HAS A SLIGHTLY (VERY SLIGHTLY) SMOKEY FLAVOR AS WELL AS SALT. GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE THE GRINDER IS NOT ADJUSTABLE. THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO ME AS SOMETIMES I LIKE A COARSER GRAIN, SOMETIMES NOT. PITY. BUT WILL ORDER AGAIN WITHOUT THE GRINDER.AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE."
5,Valentines are hearts....,"Make yours good from the start. Kids will love the funny (and sometimes not so nice) rhymes. The watercolors are charming and the message is good. Gilbert discovers that what appears to be meanness is often just a misunderstanding. He also learns that two wrongs don't make a right. The author conveys these ""feel good"" messages without being too heavy handed. This is a great book to read with your children before they embark on writing their own valentines."
4,Cute book!,"It's just what I expected, but cheaper than buying it at the book store. I work at a school and I love reading this book to the children around Valentine's Day."
4,Gift for Granddaughter,"My granddaughter is 6; she loved the title, it made her giggle. The story didn't grab her but it was ok."
3,"Review By Cherie, Jenn and Natalie",We really liked the illustration and the funny poems and the good moral of the book. There wasn't anything really that we didn't like while reading it.
4,Disorder yields to Order (page 83) Right on target!,"Last paragraph (page 202) regarding the Japanese surrender to General MacArthur: ""In the midst of a ceremony celebrating America's greatest military triumph, a display of American industrial strength stole the show. Ironically, none of those awed by the massive overflight knew that every single one of those warplanes was built on an assembly line managed according to T. P. Wright's learning curve. Somehow the economic lessons riveted into the fuselages of those aircraft were deeply impressed upon the vanquished Japanese, while the victorious Americans failed to grasp the source of their triumph."" Logical thinking for the most part that is worth the time to read. Also see ""Post Capitalist Society"" for relative logic."
1,Not too Durable,"We bought this product as a back up in case of a worst case scenerio involving a simular stuffed animal for our daughter.After maybe a few weeks, a couple of months tops, of playing with it, it came apart at the seams."
3,Good reading while waiting in an airport...,"The interview style presented here occasionally makes one cringe. E.g., David Barsamian's admission that he does NY Times crossword puzzles, and his hope that Zinn doesn't hold it against him come as treacly. Another example is Zinn's comparisons of himself with Chomsky. Although perhaps in the original radio interviews these sounded funny, they really make Zinn come across as an alienated armchair Marxist from time to time. And that's too bad, because there's a lot of good stuff in this book.It's a good, quick read, with some nice historical tidbits thrown in. It's interesting in presenting facets of Zinn's personal life, but of course, the main attraction of Zinn is his take on history.I DO think though he's underestimated the internet- I personally think that here, the rats have taken over the laboratory, and that's the way it'll be."
3,"Good idea, average execution","This is not a typical romance novel, so it's quite refreshing to read something a bit different from all the other stories in the genre."
3,2.5 stars.,"Aidan Duhearst is slightly startled to find that the person controlling his fate when he is captured as a spy in France is a beautiful woman. Yet, somehow, she aids in his escape, allowing him to return to England, where they meet again. Aidan does not realize that the woman who has caught his attention and possibly his heart, Celeste Rivenhall, is an undercover operative, working for the mysterious Falcon to help England against Napoleon. Does he dare to love the enemy? Celeste is used to her life being at risk, but her heart is another matter.** The storyline in this La Femme Nikita meets the Regency novel is a bit flat. However, if you are looking for something rather different among Regencies, then this could fit the bill. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
5,One of the Best Romances I have read all Year!,"WOW! I read this book in a span of 24 hours I could not put it down - at 1 am I tried to go to bed after starting the book but finally after tossing and turning I turned the light back on at 4 am and didn't get out of bed until I finished.I loved all of her characters - even the bad ones were really interesting! Almost every one of her secondary characters is interesting enough to get their own story and hopefully the ones that survived this story will find their own story in the future. I was shocked and saddened to see one of the secondary characters killed off - I would like to have seen him have a happier ending - And I have to admit one of ""bad"" characters that is killed in the end had me kind of bummed.The author draws you into so many different characters lives and she does it expertly! I cannot wait until the next book comes out!THIS IS A MUST READ!!"
5,Sexy story from a talented new author!,"There are romance novels that just seem to stick with you long after you've finished them and this wonderful story from Samantha Saxon is simply one of the best I've read in a very long time. And believe me, I have read hundreds of romance novels. The two main characters are so different from the stereotypical romance characters. Celeste is brave, honorable and strong without being overly liberated for her time period. Aidan is a hunk with a heart. Besides being wonderfully heartwrenching and heartwarming, let me say that the sexual tension between the two characters is palpable from beginning to end! The love scenes are some of the hottest and most creative I've ever read without being overtly graphic. I have already loaned this book to at least half a dozen people and not one has been disappointed! I can't wait to get my hands on a copy of the next installment ""The Lady Killer"". I am going to get my hands on anything that Samantha Saxon writes in the future!"
3,Not what I expected,"What I received was not what was pictured. I got this as a gift and purposly choose the more expensive one, because of its coloring. The one I got was brown and not blue as pictured above."
1,WRONG BACKGAMMON GAME AGAIN!!,"LAST TIME I ORDERED THIS, I EXPECTED WHAT I SAW IN THE PICS AS OTHER REVIEWERS, THE PRETTY BLUE TOURNAMENT BACKGAMMON WITH VINYL OUTSIDE AND FELT INSIDE, VERY ATTRACTIVE. WHEN THEY SENT ME AN UGLY BROWN WOOD ONE INSTEAD, I SENT THEM AN EMAIL NOTIFYING AMAZON OF THE PROBLEM. THEY RESPONDED QUICKLY, AND SAID THEY'D IMMEDIATELY SEND OUT THE CORRECT ITEM (THE ONE PICTURED AND DESCRIBED) AND TO SEND THE UGLY ONE BACK AT THEIR EXPENSE. I SENT THE UGLY ONE BACK, AND TODAY I GET THE REPLACEMENT DELIVERY.....IT'S ANOTHER UGLY BROWN WOOD BACKGAMMON!! (BESIDES BEING UGLY, WOOD IS NOT DURABLE, IT SCRATCHES VERY EASILY, SHOWS EVERY LITTLE FINGERPRINT AS WELL!) SO, THIS IS GOING BACK TOO. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY MY PACKING SLIP SAYS ""PAVILION TOURNAMENT BACKGAMMON"", YET THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS.WHERE CAN I GET THE ONE PICTURED AND DESCRIBED HERE? IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, DON'T SHOW IT FOR SALE AND TEASE PEOPLE!!"
1,Truly a work of the darkside...,This movie was horrible. Too much talking and not enough useful information. Don't waste your money.
1,An insult to Star Wars,"I bought the video because I expected to see background information, behind the scene clips, a lot about Episode 1 or even 2 or 3. But what did I see: everything about the hype that Star Wars caused. Really, there's nothing more on this tape. Okay, sometimes actors say a funny line about production, but the most of it is boring. I guess that's because it isn't released by LucasFilm. Companies who're trying to imitate Lucas usually can't come up with something good and T.U.S.S. isn't an exception either."
3,Not to bad,The video was not so bad. I have already seen it all on ET and other programs on TV. But if you want to understand more you should watch it. I think you can rent it. I learned a litte from the film and I did know a lot before seeing it.
1,Released around the time Episode I hit the theatres...,"I don't like this movie one bit and was sorely disappointed when I first saw it. Originally aired on the Sci-Fi Channel around the release date for Episode I, all it shows is stupid, moronic SW freaks running around and acting stupid, while talking about the films. That's it. Nothing more. I thought it would be more of a BTS (Behind the scenes) look at the universe of George Lucas's classic space opera, but instead it's just too teasing to watch. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Bantha Poodoo!,"The problem with this video is that it's just loose interviews strung together without any thought behind it. The info is nothing new, and they don't show any cool behind the scenes stuff. Hard to believe, but they actually found a way to make Star Wars boring."
3,Could have been worse...,"Well, I knew not to expect a whole lot from this when they got two characters names wrong (Bobba Fett and Biggs Starflyer), but then I guess that is what to expect from something completely unauthorized. I would even go as far as to say that I believe that some of their information was false.All that aside, if you are a Star Wars fan, check it out, as there are some good clips of Daniels, Baker, and Mayhew. Otherwise skip it."
5,Excellent,I'm not sure if those who reviewed this are true Star Wars fans. I learned a lot from this video. I saw the men under the masks of Boba Fett & Chewbacca. Anthony Daniels doesn't normally sound like C3-P0 and has to change his voice to do it. You see Lucas' house in Modesto where he grew up. There is a lot of detail I did not know about. There is so much more than what I have mentioned. It is a fascinating video. I highly recommend it.
3,Not nearly as good as previous releases!,"I never thought that I would write this about one of the Hotel Costes albums, but I am quite disappointed with this, the latest release from the Hotel Costes series!I've just bought Costes 7 and Costes 8. And, while I feel that Costes 7 is a great album, filled with the usual beauty and variety of previous Costes albums, Costes 8 just doesn't feel like it belongs to the same league!Surely there are some interesting songs (tracks 1, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15 and 16 are my favourite ones), but as a whole this album lacks the sensuality and style that previous releases had!"
3,Could be better,"This CD (#8 in a series) is probably one of the weaker ones. The best one for me was Hotel Costes 5, with Hotel Costes 3 almost there as well. But the last two albums seem to be going in the wrong direction, I liked 6th album better then 7th, and 7th better then this last one. There are a few good tracks, but no novelty, nothing that cathes you by surprise or makes you go back and listen to the track again. In fact I skipped to the next track after about half the song, the first time I listened to it. I tried to listen to it the second time - still nothing. It seems the better the album cover, the worse is the content. Could do better, Stephan!"
4,Costes and Beyond,"I bought this album along with the new San Francisco Under a Groove Vol. 1 this week. I like the Costes album well enough, but I have to say that I've been listening more to the SF Under a Groove album. It's a great mix of new jazz, funk, breakbeat and new soul, with some great deep house tracks. The Hotel Costes album was good, but pretty predictable. The highlight on the album is the track with Lee Scratch Perry. San Francisco Under a Groove had this surprisingly amazing deep house track called Spontaneous Love. both albums are good buys for entertaining at home or out at the club. Cheers."
3,Not as stellar as I hoped it would be,"Compared to Claude Challe's (Best Of) and Jose Padilla's (Man Ray 4) latest installments, Stephane Pompougnac's Hotel Costes 8 lacks excitement. I tried listening to Hotel Costes 8 from start to end for three straight times but it didn't get a hold of me. Like the first reviewer, I find myself listening more to my other recent music purchases than Costes 8. Not that Hotel Costes 8 is bad (if it was bad then I wouldn't give it 3 stars) but there are other more exciting compilations available this year. If you had to decide between Hotel Costes 8 and Man Ray 4, you're better off getting Jose Padilla's Man Ray 4 instead."
3,Kinda glitchy,"I don't know if it's because it's old or maybe it's a good bootleg(yes there are bootlegs out there!), but the game came wrapped it what seems to be it's original box. Inside was all the nintendo stuff you'd expect to find and the handbook, but once i popped the game in the nuisance happened. It ran great for about 5 minutes then glitched out and froze. I turned it off, then back on and same deal. Froze after 5 minutes. If you wanna take the chance go for it, but be warned that it may be defective!Overall:Game didn't work at first but after a few tries it seems to be running fine(hoping it stays that way)Original box, wrapped and no damage shows just how well the game was cared for all these years(originally released in the 90's and no reprints to my knowledge)5 star game but a3 star overall for the glitches."
5,"THE CUTE, FUN, WAR-TIME GAME OF WORMS","This game is based on little army type worms that walk around a 2-D world and try to destroy the other team of Worms. It is a turn based game and the worms have cute little remarks when they attack, get hit, die and go to WORM heavan and more. This is a very fun game filled with funny sounds and sights. The game is full of replay value and will never get boring. WARNING! THIS GAME IS VERY ADDICTING, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EVER PUT IT DOWN!"
3,If you are a serious junkie...its so so...,"Okay. I am a Worms Junkie. I love the game...(Worms Armageddon/World Party for PC). The Gameboy color version is about what you would expect from its primitive 8-bit processor. If you are considering buying this version, dont. The Gameboy Advance version, Worms World Party, is almost a near perfect conversion from the PC. I have the first screenshots, and it looks beautiful."
4,Worms Veterans Look here...newbies keep looking,"I wa recently turned onto the entire worms era by a friend of mine who insisted that worms shooting each other with insane weapons in entertaining. At first it was lame but then it became very addicting! I was on a road trip and saw the game on a shelf and figured...Worms is a fun game and this version is portable, why not? It turned out to be a small let down do to the amount of weapons and the complete lack of missions. The game is still great and is wonderful if you are a worm fan who travels a lot. But if you have a choice to get the comp/psx/DC/N64 version over this...go for it. Otherwise this is a really fun game with 40 some levels and 14 weapons."
4,Pinetop's Duets with the Ladies,"Pinetop Perkins was 91 when this CD was released . It is a CD of duets he did with leading women blues stars as well as some songs on his own. Among his duet partners are Deborah Coleman, Susan Tedeschi, Madeline Peyroux (more of a jazz star), Marcia Ball, Angela Strehli, and Odetta. The duets concept has been used by many others but what makes this good is he chooses really good and diverse artists to work with. A very good CD with a lot of top talent in support of one of blues top piano players. 4.5 Stars."
4,Very enjoyable,"This was my first music download from Amazon, and it was worth it. If you like Pintop Perkins you can't go wrong here. Pinetop isn't the strongest singer, though he isn't bad either. What he does here is work with several vocalists and does what he does best, plays great piano. This is a fun and enjoyable collection of music!"
4,like it,"The pastry brush works as expected, great for spreading butter or egg wash. It is lightweight and small (as desired)."
5,IMPOSSIBLE TO OVER-RATE!,"I usually don't bother to write reviews for Amazon, but this time, my excitment is too big. If you ever get the chance to listen to this CD, you'll see that the moment it starts playing, the magic begins. Every single work in this album is played with a great precision and every single note makes sense. Maisky and Argerich are so in tune with one another...A wide range of expressive capacity in display...ideal recording quality... And the encore piece is so free-flowing, so well articualted, so improviastion-like, that it gives us the ideal Chopin sound. In any case. To hear Argerich play Chopin is a real delight,enough of a reason by itself. In this case, the entire album is a delight and the fact that total playing time is almost 80 minutes is a cause for celebration. Really beautiful.Bravo!"
1,Hopeless,"The thing is supposed to change color (green or purple), but doesn't... I wouldn't buy it for 1 cent..."
1,Dimmer than my plug in night lights & they flicker,"I bough two of these for my living area, yes for night time when relaxing after the child has gone to sleep. For about 48 bucks each, I am very dissapointed. I have brand new top brand batteries in them, and they put out less light than my cheepo plug in night lights. On top of that I have had them for a couple months and already had to replace the batteries in them, I think... They are flickering and one is way more dim than the other. When I push or wiggle them the flickering may improve. I would not buy these again for this high price. I used to think you get what you paid for, but these proved that theory wrong."
4,Great light!,"I've had it for a week now and so far, so good. This light is a great addition to a bedroom. It gives just enough light; just the right glow to see in but not too bright like a regular lamp. The battery operation is a plus although I suggest using rechargeable batteries because it takes six AA! The fixture is glass and well made. It does have weight to it. Not flimsy. The size is appropriate for a wall, not too big and not too small. I didn't give it five stars because I think it's a bit pricey for a battery operated lamp."
4,Light it up!,"I looked for a battery operated wall sconce for a long time. Finally I chose this one and I am very happy with it. Hangs in our hallway. Gives just enough light to change the thermostat and gives a glow to our wall of family pics. Shortly after we hung it, the power went off for 2 hours. Handy!! Hope the bulb lasts a long while as it is a funky one."
3,Wireless Wall Sconce,"I bought a pair to illuminate corners in our family room. The wall sconces are beautiful in appearance. However as for the light output they are not worth the money. You are paying for the frosted globes which are pretty to look at only. The sconces themselves, I think are cheaply made especially the battery pack. I have had night lights brighter than the sconces. It is good to use if you just want to use as a night light to give an area minimal low light. Do not buy to illuminate a dim room. It barely gives enought light to light up the sconce through the thick glass."
2,Fell off and broke within 5 minutes of putting up,I dislike the design because we finally put it up and it wasn't up any longer than 5 minutes and I touched it and it fell off and broke into a million pieces. Back to the drawing board.
1,empty box,this arrived and the only the shade was in the box. none of the mounting or electrical components were in there. completely unusable. big dissapointment.
1,Manipulated by the machine,"Unwillingly, the film reveals how B.G. gets manipulated by the Machine. Do not watch unless you have listened to his Post-American brilliant songs.The film is especially depressing if you only know the original Aquarium tracks.BG and Aquarium had survived the KGB and cernsorship, only to fall victim to the American show biz. In the end, it does not really matter which is which."
2,"Did not fit, not worth returning.","I purchased this adapter for my shower head, and it did not fit. Bad on me for not knowing better and measuring and double checking sizes. However, cost of shipping it back would have meant I would get back $.50 or something, so not worth it, just ate the cost of the product. Fortunately, I realized I could just replace the entire arm that sticks out of the wall (Thanks, OSH!) rather than using the ball joint, and the problem has been solved."
2,could not use,this product has pipe threads. For my application I needed a fine thread.so I replaced the ball arm with a standard one. problem solved.
5,Deluxe sounds,"I love it when a band can play in whatever style the song calls for, and Gloria Deluxe manages this on every cut on the album. The guitar riff on ""Little Piece of Grace"" sounds like it could be on a record from West Africa, ""Such a Long Time"" is pure Hank Williams, ""Down in the Mud"" rocks down and dirty, and ""One-Legged Waltz"" somehow swings all the way across the musical pendulum and back again in one song. Cynthia Hopkins' lyrics always tell a story, but they don't beat you over the head with it. And the band's music is the same way, Hooker's been in heavy rotation on my CD player since i picked it up, and i keep hearing new things. These guys do so many things so well i can't believe they aren't huge yet. Oh well, when they get there, at least i can say I was into them before it was hip."
2,Overrated,"This product only lasted for 2 uses and my hair is about two inches past my shoulders. I'm ethnically mixed (Japanese, Native American and Mexican) and it really didn't do that much for my hair. My hair condition is some dryness on the ends, slightly wavy, and medium thickness. Also, I died my hair super blue black, bleached sections and applied ultra violet dye to the bleached sections, so I guess you could say my hair is fairly processed.I applied this stuff to my hair, put a shower cap on, and then I wrapped my head in a hot wet towel. This stuff did almost nothing. I noticed no change at all, but it did grease the heck out of my scalp. I ended up using this other stuff I picked up from CVS for about 6$ and it worked like magic."
4,"Works, but doesn't last long.","I like this product because it made my hair feel very soft after using it, but I won't be buying it again because I personally can't afford this price for something that runs out so quickly. My hair is thin, about two inches past my shoulders, and it only lasted about 3 treatments. I don't think I'm putting on too much, I put just enough to cover all of my hair. It does work though and it has an interesting smell, reminds me of maple and brown sugar oatmeal."
4,Makes my hair nice and soft!,"I normally use Aphogee protein treatments to take care of my breakage, but decided to take a break from it and bought this item because I heard so many great things about it. I have to say, it DOES make my hair nice and soft and a little stronger. I may have to use this with their shampoo and conditioner to get the best of both worlds, though."
5,Mary Stanton scores again!,"Like all the rest of the books in this series, the story was great. The ending is something of a cliffhanger - I was left with quite a few questions. I have heard a rumor that this is the last book in the series. If it is, I think other readers will agree, we need one more short book on what happens later. Overall, though, it is a very good book!"
2,Huh??,I love this series and I would have given this book five stars except for one fact. Is it supposed to be the end of the series? If it is it's a pretty terrible ending!! The contents of the book arn't anything close to what the back cover tells. Mary Stanton had better write another or I will be one very dissapointed reader!
2,WHAT A LET-DOWN! WHERE'S THE ENDING!,"After reading eight books with my daughter in this series, I can't help but voice my disappointment! This book is not the conclusion of the series as it is touted to be. Far from it! This is just ""another"" book in the series that leaves just as many casual resolutions and abrupt endings. I guess we will all have to wait for the next book in the series if there ever is one or neatly put away your aspirations of ever finding out what finally happens!"
5,What's next??,My son and I have read all 8 of this series and am anxiously waiting for number 9. The characters are wonderful (even the nasty ones) The only problem with this exciting adventurous story is being left wanting more and there aren't any. Don't read if you can't stand to be left hanging!!
1,These keep getting worse and worse....,"This book was a terrible ending to this series. It was so awful I wished that I hadn't even started this series.I finished this series at thirteen, three years ago. Ever since then it has been, to me, an example of how not to write a series.The first book is very good. If Stanton had kept up to that standard she would have had a great series. Unfortunately, the series is episodic-- it never flows; some of the books have no point in the series (especially this one); and the main point in the series, which is brought up in the first book, is never resolved. With the exception of characters from the first book, Stanton rarely reused her old characters. Instead, she added new characters and abandoned them after the book was over. It is incredibly evident in Shadows with the new ""surprise"" villian. This book could have been used to tie up loose ends, but it ended up being a waste of my time."
3,very good but series needs another installment,I loved this book! i own all the other books in the series and have read them all numerous times. i think Mary Stanton should write a book 9 and maybe 10! I want to know what happens after but overall this was a great book!
5,It is fun to read this book,"I just read half of the book. It is really interesting book.During the summer time, I organized a book club and let kids read Nancy rue and max lucado's book and gave a book report presentation using PowerPoint.Here is what Kathy (11 years) said about this book""Lily prays to God. She thinks that God wants her to be an advocate. Eventually, she found out she heard what she wanted to hear and calling it God, instead of actually hearing God.""The whole presentation is at[...]"
5,A book Jesus would read with joy,"Finding God Again is a gem. The author presents concrete examples from dozens of interviews with people speaking about how they perceive God. The book shows how the living God can often be hidden behind religious rhetoric, how the living God can speak again to people, and how people can move beyond the super-critical, life-draining distortion of God to discover in their lives the unconditionally loving, life-giving God of Jesus.This book, together with Dr. Beier's lucid analysis of A Violent God-Image (2004), are essential reading for all those who want to rediscover the God of grace and love."
4,"Clear, period.","Clearly written, clearly argued. Some reviewers are upset that he basically takes a psychological / developmental approach to faith, but I don't know what else one would expect out of a psychologist of religion!"
4,"VERY WELL DONE, BUT","IT WAS WELL DONE, BUT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE XP COMPATABLE (STIL WORKS THOUGH. OH, AND WE NEED MORE OF THIS TYPE OF GAMES."
5,it's fun,"This is a great collection with five different games. The one I have is (Red Alert 2) and (Yuri's Revenge). Red Aleart 2 has two disc one ally other enemy were you can be against your own country and fight for the Soviet Union. I always knew Yuri was such a character doing his mind control that's why he has his own game. Special agent Tonya fights for the U.S. she's like ""Lora Croft Tome Rader"" caring two guns and blows stuff up, shes and some navy seals are the only one that can swim. I love seeing real people on hear like your watching a movie."
5,Pure and simple,"Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2 and the expansion pack, Yuri's Revenge is more than enough to justify a $20 price tag - that in itself is a bargain, with more than enough to keep any sane person entertained for hours on end, especially with the floods of modifications availabale for the game. To get three additional games thrown in just says it all. Pure and Simple"
4,The Command & Conquer Collection,Love the games but only one thing wrong with them. Most of them do not work on Windows 7. Thank god I have another computer with Windows XP. They are alot of fun a little different controls then what I am used to but lots of fun.
1,My guppy doesn't like them at all.,"No,it's not enjoyed by all fish. My guppy does not enjoy them. He won't eat them at all. Not one bit. (He can't type a review himself so I wrote this on his behalf.)"
2,Slick advertising,"Product is fine just realize 49/50-Ounce = .98 oz in the real world, and what's printed on the bag. That's less than one ounce. Amazon should try and be less ""deceptive"" in their description."
1,Stay away,I was not happy with this product at all. The cubes were petrified. They did not break apart easily & would not stick to the side of my tank. My fish did not seem to like it much either -- they all died within 2 weeks of starting to use this product.
5,Track LIst,"Rachmaninoff; Andrew Litton; Royal Philharmonic Orchestra - Rachmaninoff: The Isle of the Dead / Symphony No. 1 (1992)CD 5 tracks, 66:52Genre ClassicalLabel Virgin Records UsTrack List01 Isle Of The Dead 21:0002 Symphony No 1 - I Grave - Allegro ma non troppo 14:0503 II Allegro animato 08:4804 III Larghetto 09:4605 IV Allegro con fuoco 13:13"
4,"thorough, practical and perfect preparation",Great in depth study of all practical business implications and types of common solutions to big inflations in the economy and in business. Made by professional US team studying Latin American companies over the years
1,Could have been done in 5 pages,"This is a very short book. Only 87 pages, but all the material could have been presented in about 5 pages. And of that 5 pages of material, at least half is just common sense. The kind of thing you could come up with in 15 minutes of brainstorming.Really, this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The informational content was almost non-existent.I have to wonder if all of the other reviews where written by family and friends of the author."
2,Technically competent but lacking any artistry,"Sinopoli is decent, the principal singers lacking in understanding and charm (Dessay is the exception), quite put into the shade by the so-called secondary characters [Dohmen, the Genzes,etc]. Bright, clean sound --- and all meaningless when the phrasing is lifeless and uncomprehending. Voigt's big aria is, indeed, 'Totenreich' --- lugubrious, rhythmically flaccid, and totally graceless. Yes, the notes ping, but so do those of a synthesizer. Gramophone is spot on to call this voice 'stainless steel'. For those who are unconvinced by this Strauss opera, this will provide ample reinforcement. For those who believe in Ariadne, this recording will test their faith. In a word: stillborn."
1,¡Decepcionante!,"Aunque el desempeño de la orquesta es excelente, gracias a la brillante batuta de Sinooli, el importante papel de Ariadna asumido por Debora Voight es decepcionante: terrible vibrato, problemas de fiato y una colocación esforzada y tensa. Les recomiendo mejor la versión de Schwarzkopf o Norman."
4,truffle ornament,very cute but I would prefer to be able to hang the ornament instead of clipping it.
4,Worms- better than you think!,"Worms Armaggedon was surprisingly fun and refreshingly un-quarky. Any game w/ ""worm"" in the title is automatically assumed a kid's game with a cheesy, ""A bug's life"" feel... this one strays from that stereotype and actually becomes a fun game! 4worms to a team, up to 4 teams, tons of interesting weapons and strateges, many variations on gameplay."
4,Right on target. Stimulating ideas. Quick and easy read.,"Schlossberg concisely brings together numerous fruitful ideas that can be useful for any institution that is dealing with understanding and empowering their audience. Museums will find it particularly useful. He starts to pitch his own consulting group, though, which was a turn off."
1,Contradictions in logic and example,"After reading Interactive Excellence, I found this book contains exessive contradictions in both logic and example. Mr. Schlossberg does a exeedingly competent job in his chosen feild, but seems ill equipped to discuss his topic to the depth it needs to be examined. This book could be edited down to a good two pages that would be informative. Possibly to use as a preface to a discussion If you think I am wrong, let me know. I would be more than happy to expand the level of the authors understanding on the subject over coffee and doughnuts sometime. Heck, he might even convince me the last twenty years of audience research I have done was wasted time. Signed...Master Magician and Paranormalist JIM CALLAHAN"
5,MeShell is the Truth!!!,"For all Ndgeocello fans this one is a must have as is all of them. I am ashamed to say how long I had it on cassette before I finally bought it on CD. Her deep soul searching, right at ya style wrapped in jazz and based on the classics.. Enough said!!!"
2,"""Best of"" the MCA years","This album collects tracks from the Kinks' three albums on MCA (Think Visual, UK Jive, and Live: The Road), all of which are quite enjoyable and have other great tracks which are not included here. If you're at all interested in these songs, skip this compilation and go for the albums they originally appeared on."
3,"Good, but...","The book covers about 70% of the exam. Its coverage of VSS, VCM and Package and Deployment Wizard are very superficial. These topics are very important in the exams (PDW has 10 to 15 questions) and can make the difference between pass the exam or not. The coverage of COM is good but incompleted. If you use only this book you need good experience in Client/Server applications. I used this book for some basic material and, the best of all, MCSD in a Nutshell by James Foxall (good coverage of PDW, VSS, VCM and COM). This last was my main guide to pass the exam. I agree with other reviewers: this exam isn't for beginners, you need at least two intensive years of experience building real applications to catch some questions. Without it, this book -any book- can help."
5,"If you want to take the test, buy this book","Very well written, pricise, to the point, and light. Covers exams objectives, and doesn't go beyond that."
2,Good Hands-On Experience - Get Another Book To Study,"This book had great labs to help you get some hands-on experience, but is lacking GREATLY in test sensitive material. I got MCSD In A Nutshell from Oreilly Press. I passed the test with an 857. This book did very little to help me achieve that goal. MCSD In A Nutshell + Transender Exams = You Pass"
2,Won't get you through the test,This book won't give you what you need to pass the test but it will point you in the right direction. But don't buy this book and think you'll pass the test.
3,Good Overview,"This book covered all of the topics needed for me to pass 70-176 the first time. Before buying the book, I had a very erroneous impression of what was going to be on the test. I supplemented the book with on-line help and the transcender exams (I recommend both very strongly).The book does not go into sufficient depth, but it does point the way.The book received many different ratings. This could be due to the fact that the exams taken by the reviewers may have empasized different topics. For example, there was very little internet on my exam, but a ton of packaging and deployment.Good luck."
3,"Good book, but not enough!!!","I read the book and understood all the concepts, I even passed their sample test by 90% the first try. I took the MS exam and failed. Find a better book, this book is really for beginner VB programers."
3,50 % possible,"I want to recommend that this book provide not enough information you need to read 70-175 by the same publisher (this will help you ) and still get 60%. A lots of questions in the real exam not in this book and please prepare to select 2 answers at the same time i.e. in some case this book provide you only 1 answers for solutions but in the real exam they need 2 answers : In some quetions you need to answer as Create Symbolic debug info but they will ask you to check 2 answers. What you will answer? All the books just tell you about 1 answers, please be prepared."
2,"Lacks Depth, Code Errors Unacceptable",Found this book to lack depth in all but the most basic areas. Many of the code samples have errors which is unacceptable. There are some areas on the test not covered at all in this book. You will need to supplement your study with another source if you want to pass the exam.
3,"Good explanations, but basic. NOT FOR EXAM!","Hello ppl. I passed the exam yesterday with a score of 971. I used this book and the book by Syngress. Although the explanations in this book are very good and to the point, this book covers only about 50% of what's required for the exam. The other book covers about 75% to 80%. This books doesn't give you an idea about what depth of understanding is needed for the exam. Exam like questions aren't there at all. You CANNOT pass the exam relying on this books only."
2,It does not provide value for the 70-176 exam,"This book's contents and the exam questions appear to come from two different worlds, the exam seems to focus on COM and application deployment which are areas that this material barely mentions, with limited samples and exercises, many of the subjects that the exam covered, specially in deployment and help are not covered in this book.. Do yourself a favor, do not rely it on this book to pass the test."
3,visual basic 6.0,I am a software programer for this reason it is necessary to reads some book at v.b.6.I also want to pass mcsd tract.So I want to reads some book v.b.6
2,"Ahh, Microsoft... So Incomplete","You've heard all this before, if you've read any of the other reviews on this page. So I'll be brief about the book, and then tell you what you really want to know, and that's how to prepare for the test.The book is, as per the MOC usual, a general foundation and overview of the technologies, but very much lacking in the detail needed for you to pass the exam.The exam tests your knowledge of data types, default properties for controls (referencing ""text1"" is the same as referencing ""text1.text""), focuses heavily on how to deploy solutions (to web server? To floppy? To CD-ROM? You decide...), and stresses data services as well (knowing which cursor types and locations to use).Read this book for a good overall picture, but also read the following:- VB6 Desktop Exam Prep- VB6 Black Book- VB6 Distributed Exam Cram (this will give you some cross-reference on data services and package/deployment)Good luck on the test."
3,Passed 70-176,"This book alone is not enough to pass the exam. I did it using this book and Transcender. First I went through the entire book, did all the exercises, and took notes to use for study. When finished, I did the Transcender simulated exams. I took all of the simulated exams (flunked all the first time through), then went back and studied the answers and why the answer was correct. I passed the real exam the first time. A lot of material is not covered by the book, but the book exposes you to areas of Visual Basic that you don't use in your work environment. As one example, the exam covers Package and Deployment in much more depth than the book."
2,MCSD Training Kit - Not!,"I bought this book to attempt to prepare for the VB certification. It is definately not the way to go. The questions at the end of the chapters are not focused on passing an exam at all. After studying the entire book, I was only able to answer 1/2 the questions on a simulated exam. (And I knew VB before I started)In contrast, I purchased ""The Complete JAVA 2 Certification Study Guide"" by Roberts, Heller and Ernest and was able to pass the JAVA certification in 2 1/2 months, even though I knew no JAVA when I started. This book is a good book to work through and learn some more Visual Basic. It has good labs, but as far as a preparation for the Certification Exam, you'll need to look elsewhere."
4,Novice User - Passed 70-176 with this book,"To prepare for the 70-176, I used primarily this book and the Courseware from the Microsoft Course that covers most of the topics for 70-176. Between the two, and the little knowledge I have using VB, I passed the test on the first try. I found the labs very helpful as they showed the same concepts from the course that I attended but used MS Access as the datasource instead."
2,Preperation for Beginners,I failed the test after reading this book for 1 1/2 months. I believe the book is good for beginner programmers who are learning VB but not so good for passing the MCSD exam.
4,Good Book But Not Enough To Pass The Test,"I found this book to be good but it does not contain enough info to pass the test. For example, coverage of the Package and Deployment wizard is too minimal. I recommend it highly, but you'll need more info so don't count on the info from just this book."
3,"Pretty good, but filled with aggravating errors.","On balance, the book provides a useful learning experience. Completing the lessons forced me to learn about a number of topics I had simply skipped over in my programming experience, and that is probably good for exam preparation. I was, however, apalled at the large number of errors. In some cases the process of figuring out why the code in the book did not work was in itself an interesting learning experience. In other cases the errors simply could not be fixed - such as essential files missing from the CD. I looked in vain for some instruction on how to report errors. I guess they just don't care."
1,Not recommemded.,"I've just begun reading a few pages of it and I found a number of typographical errors - a sign of poor publishing. Wish I could return the book, get my money back, and buy another VB6 exam guide book."
2,WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS BOOK FOR EXAM 70-176!!!,"Although this book provides a good overview of Visual Basic, it is no exam guide. If you want to pass the 70-176 exam, you will need a more detailed reference. I'm very Disappointed in MSPress"
2,Not sufficient preparation,I did not feel that this book adecuately covered the exam objectives. I bought the Hawhee book and studied that instead. Using that and the Trandender test I got a 942. I don't beleive that using the MS Press book will help you pass the exam. It is unfortunate that Microsoft's exam guides often do not cover the material in their own exams. I would strongly recommend the Hawhee book and of course the Trancender test.
1,Keep your money in your pocket.,"This book is okay at introducing some key topics in VB6, but the coverage is minimal at best. The associated CD-ROM contains some multimedia presentations which are also light on content. In my opinion, if you aren't up to the level of doing the exercises in this book, you have no hope of passing the exam anyway. I bought this book and read it, but there were MANY topics on sample exams that I took that were not even mentioned in this book. For the money, I recommend buying both the Exam Cram VB6 Desktop book and the VB6 Black Book. Those two resources helped me a lot in passing the exam, and together they cost about the same as this MS ""guide."""
1,For VB Test 70-176????????,"This is false advertizing. While the book is well-written, I recognize false advertizing when I see it, and this is blatant. I read many books on VB and have taken the test, so I know what is on it. This book is worthless as a screen door on a submarine, if you are reading with the goal of passing 70-176. In my opinion, you could give 50 people this book, let them study it for as long as they choose, then let them take the test, OPEN-BOOK, and unless they have had very EXTENSIVE work experience with VB (or perhaps studied from Syngress's or Hawhee's book), not one of them would pass. I found the title to be so deceptive that I sent a letter to the FTC regarding this blatant false advetizing. I sincerely wish more people would follow suit. We need more accountability from companies who publish these types of books."
3,"This book helped, but more is needed.","Typos aside, this is a good book to use in preparation for exam 70-176. It is a very clear, concise coverage of developing desktop apps using vb6.Faults: Like many other test prep books, this one skims the surface a bit too much and doesn't present the kind of detail of the subject matter that gives one a sense of mastery when confronted by actual test questions. The examples are weak in this respect as well. COM, App. maintenance, and deployment are underrepresented in this book vis-a-vis the exam.This book helped in a lot of ways, but only in conjunction with experience and other guides."
3,OK,This book I think is good for Beginners.I don't think this book alone will help one in clearing 70-176. If you know VB I will suggest not to go for this book.
4,"Fat Lip might sound like Blink 182, but who cares?","About a month ago I saw a video on MTV by a new band called Sum 41, called 'Fat Lip / Pain For Pleasure'. I loved it. I'm not really into punkrock music, though. My favorite bands include Radiohead, R.E.M. and Travis, so bands like Sum 41 seem to not really fit into this picture. But who cares!? This song is incredibly catchy. It reminds me of some Blink 182 stuff, it makes you wanna... something or someone, and I'm not even that violent. Great track... damn, I might even have to check out their debut album!"
3,Practice bagpipe chanter,"Once we figured out how to put the chanter together, I.e. Where the reed goes, it became a fun instrument to practice with. My son has enjoyed practicing and said he's getting better. I do feel the cost of this product was too expensive considering that it's plastic. But it was still a creative gift."
5,Best choice for beginners,"While unsure of what kind of chanter to buy as a surprise for my husband, I've come to find out that buying the Gibson practice chanter and booklet was the best choice for beginners after all. The instructor at his first chanter class informed my husband that he, in fact, possessed the standard practice book and chanter for beginners, and suggested that others in the class buy the kit as well. If you are looking for a practice chanter and booklet that is recommended by instructors then this is the one. By the way, be sure to get extra waxed hemp, as it needs to be changed often."
3,the leading lady,I don't like sad dog books and I especially do not like to read books where the guide dog is being mistreated. But the way the book was written was very good and he explains his anger in the book.
1,blues rock?????,this is the worst cd i have ever bought...............i'm not even sure what kind of music it is............this guy is an unbelievable guitar player and he puts out a cd like this.........don't waste your money...i love blues rock but this aint it...........whatever it is
2,Don't buy!!!,"This game ..., from the beginning to the end MSR is boring. So don't buy this game, but only if you want to be bored to death."
4,Yeowza!,"Great game. Mind-boggling superbness. Except one thing. Any and all FR cars (front-engine, rear-wheel drive cars) are nearly impossible to prevent from spinning out in the rain.So....I'm in the final few chapters, and my best car is a Toyota Celica GT-FOUR cuz it's the most powerful car available to me that isn't FR!!! And for the difficulty? Damn. Frustrating much....but that's what makes a good game....even though I'm not able to skillfully drive an RX-7 like I'd like to!!!Overall....9 out of 10."
4,"Good, yet difficult game","This game has great graphics and over 80 different routes in 3 different areas of 3 different citys. that equals up to about 700 possible routes. The down side to this game is that unless you are extremely skilled, it is hard. You get stuck a lot.The game automaticly saves yoiur progress every time you do anything. If you loose one race, it ruins your game, actually it dosent do much but can be bad if you keep loosing.To any skilled vidio game racer, this would be ideal."
2,this game is not kool,the game looked cool at first but then i found out that it... handeling is hard the music is totally blah there aren't very many options the only good thing is the graphics those rule.
2,Repetition,"This game would be good IF and only IF all cars were unlocked and you didn't have to ""earn kudos""... there should be a seperate option where u get to race any car you want at any time without having to earn it"
4,Nice and thin,"Case is very nice, great, solid fit. The feel is very nice and minimal size. The buttons seem to be a bit hard to press for me, volume and on/off, but probably just need to get used to the feel. Nice case, good build, solid fit. Slides in to pocket without issue."
3,Disappointing...,"I always buy BoxWave cases for my phones, because they are well made, practical, comfortable and good looking. This time I am disappointed, the cuts for camera with flash, S-pen, speaker and microphones are too big and it looks ugly. Plus because the S-pen is in the corner of the phone and the cut for it really big, it doesn't provide good protection at this corner. What if the phone falls on this corner?"
3,I DID NOT WRITE THIS BOOK!,"Nor did I read it.Amazon, please rectify this mistake.Thanks.Eddie Bruce."
5,Good history lesson,A must read for true hip hop heads. It took a two hour flight from NY to Miami to finish this book. Time flew by. Alot of small details that helped me appreciate the Artists even more.
2,not worth the money,"I'm disappointed in this book, especially for the price, oh sure it's nice quality paper and photographs,but the subject matter is primarily foreign cars, and the stories are just, ok, not really that interesting.You can get better stories out of some car magazines."
4,Cobra in the barn.....I thought it was about snakes.,"My car loving, drag racing husband really enjoyed this book, and he's not much of a reader. He does love all those antique, auction, storage shows on television."
4,Cobra in the Barn,"Like ""Hemi in a Barn"" , well written in bit size chapters that are easy to digest .A book you can pick up and put down easily ."
3,Great for a foreign car lover.,Selected this read based on my interest in vintage American automobiles. Was a little disappointed that more were mostly foreign makes.
3,Not what I thought it would be,"This book was nothing like I thought it was going to be. I was looking for a book on Days of our lives that was more of recapping the story line. Instead it was more about the writters, directors, and listed articals of when and what publications they were printed in."
3,For Days of our Lives fans,This was good for Days fans but not nearly as inclusive as I thought it was going to be. A little disappointing for the price I paid for it.
3,So so and outdated.,"The book seemed very pedestrian & boring. I appreciated the author's research. But too much detail about how a set is constructed and locales created can get mundane and drag the book down. I would have liked more insight into the casting, contracts, and story arcs as well. For me, people & characters are always more interesting than things."
3,Misleading entry,"On the posted listing a date of 2010 was given inferring that this book is recent and up to date,when in actuality it was published in 1995 and only gives history until 1995.This is somewhat misleading, though the book is very good."
5,Best deal is on AMAZON.COM,"Bought my pair after a few weeks of reading online reviews and testing different ones in stores. Amazon had the best price. The zoom is smooth. I find that I most often use it at 8 thru 10x zoom. I hardly ever use the 24x zoom. Reason is that it is too hard to keep a steady image. The same is true for any other set that has anything more than 12x magnification. It is nice, but you must have some kind of support to effectively use it. If you think that you can get away without using a tripod for 24x magnification, and buy a fixed binocular set with super high magnification, you will end up very dissapointed. So I would recommend this eagleview, or another nikon with either 10x or 12x magnification."
5,great ablbum,these albums put together on one cd are great the only thing is that there is some songs missing from the original albums in order to get the other songs you should get the kinks first album and kinda kinks with the bonus songs from sanctuary in combonation with this one this album is great though it is the kinks when they were a rockin british wave band and they had session men like jimmy page playing on there albums
5,"Nice, day or night!",Very nice earrings. Love the comfort of leverbacks and the less worry of them falling out. Simple yet classy. All around wear! Love it!
4,"Pretty earrings, nice silver","These earrings are pretty. They are a nice, light weight- good for people who have recently had their ears pierced. The leverbacks work well. The only reason I did not give them five stars is that they are a little too dainty for me. I like more ethnic, chunky jewelry; this is a matter of personal preference, though. I would recommend them because they are well-made."
4,Canada vs.U.S.A.,"Maximum Impact '97 was the IYH:Canadian Stampede PPV event that took place in July 1997. The main event was a 10-man tag team match that put The Hart Foundation: Bret Hart, Owen Hart, British Bulldog, Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart and Brian Pillman against Team U.S.A.: Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust and the Legion of Doom. You will also see the WWF Championship on the line between Champion- The Undertaker and Challenger- Vader. Plus, HHH vs. Mankind and a great light-heavyweight match between the Great Sasuke and future champ Taka Michinoku. Even though there were only a few matches, this event is a good solid 2 hours of WWF wrestling action."
3,More Worms on the Net than in this Book,"While this book is interesting, I found more information by surfing the net."
5,wormderful!,I just got my worms and this book was an easy quick read providing all I needed to know to care for them. I hope to be fertilizing my garden with worm compost in another couple months.
3,Recycling to the Max,"More and more people are developing an interest in non-toxic methods of horticulture and agriculture. Not only that, but the limitations of landfills, the expense of fossil fuels, and the growing body of evidence showing a relationship between human activity and global warming is leading us to consider the wisdom of recycling. Everything. So here we are with a natural, inexpensive method of enriching our soil, and making it disease and pest resistant. This book is a great introduction to the topic of vermiculture. It may take a while before you actually get up the courage to do it, because the book does not adequately dramatize and address the fears and revulsions most people have to rotting, decomposition, and the like. But still, it's a good book."
5,Adore this book!,"I got this book out of the library before purchasing because I wasn't sure if it would be outdated in any way. Well, turns out worm composting doesn't change a whole lot over time. This book has a ton of great advice about building your own bin, and using a bin once you purchase or build one.Want to know what to feed your new worms? What NOT to feed them? It's all in here, plus inspiring stories about vermicomposting, using your compost, and what to do if you have problems.If you're getting into vermicomposting, I'd highly recommend Amy Stewart's Book The Earth Moved: On the Remarkable Achievements of Earthworms. It's a fun read that will leave you with new admiration for your wormy pets.The Earth Moved: On the Remarkable Achievements of Earthworms"
5,"FINALLY I HAVE ""ALL"" THE ANSWERS !",After reading the many reviews of various 'worm' books/farms...I sent away for this one NOT to be disappointed !!Awesome book with so much info...easy to read and follow !! Cute drawings/perfect diagrams !!Now I have my grand-daughter andher friends reading it/learning and NOW each one is starting their own compost bin etc .. so we can have a 'worm' race :) tosee who can grow the most as well as using them for bate !!
5,Easy to read and follow - a must for everyone,Great little book that covers it all in an easy to read format. Explains the process and how to accomplish your own vermiculture products at home and at the same time reduce the amount of waste going to the dumps. It's an easy to learn win win situation.
3,Wait! There's a Better One!,"Anyone who is interested in this topic must read ""Recycle With Earthworms: The Red Wiggler Connection""In my opinion it is a much better book than ""Worms Eat My Garbage,"" but definitely does not get the recognition deserved!Check it out! It's awesome!"
3,worms eat her garbage,"This book is very detailed about vermicomposting, in fact, if there is nothing you would rather do than extoll the virtues of worms..this is the book for you. It is informative and useful, but maybe a little long for those who just want to be greener and reduce waste."
4,"""The book"" on the topic","This is one of the most referenced and most often quoted books on home vermiculture. It is clearly written, simple to read, and generally useful.It is also out of date.This book is based on the time it was written, when there were only a few options other than ""build it yourself"", and build it yourself was big bins outside. If you are an apartment or small house dweller you will find this book less useful as it *mostly* assumes a larger scale operation than a small home can manage.This book is going to be useful to the small scale composter, and inspirational, and educational, but will leave many questions unanswered, and will not answer a lot of the questions in managing a small plastic based bin."
5,Es excelente,A mi me encargaban leer libros en la primaria... Y entre nuestros compañeros nos prestabamos los libros que teníamos... Lamentablemente en español casi no hay libros aptos para niños y este libro es uno de los pocos que yo pude leer y que me prestaron que es excelente para los niños... Se los recomiendo ampliamente... Esta muy bonito y muy entretenido...
5,No ka oe',"Dis book is da bomb! Mahaloz! I previously purchased the ""glued"" version of this book but it is dysfunctional on a music stand. The spiral bound edition will STAY OPEN on the stand, enabling me to pretend to sing without those big ""C"" clamps holding the pages!"
5,A great intellectual adventure,"In this marvelously written, well-documented book, Ofer Gal presents a philosophico-historical account of one of the greatest intellectual adventures in the history of science. Gal follows the tense correspondence between these two great men, Hook and Newton, tells the fascinating story of their social relationships - a story of class and prestige, competition and envy, mathematics and experimentation - and offers a philosophical analysis of the events, a pragmatic analysis which sheds a new light, a new sympathetic light, on Hook's role in this drama. For anyone who is interested in the history of science, or, quite simply, in science in general, this is a must read."
2,Disappointing,"The book offers a comprehensive factual recounting of Schwarzenneger's films through 1996, including synopses and summaries of each one's critical reception. But it offers no analysis, no discussion of Schwarzenegger's development as an actor and no insight into how various roles relate to one another, which is what I was hoping for. Bare facts such as the plot of a film or its cast list are readily available for free on the Internet.There are a few historical tidbits, but the lack of anything resembling analysis, coupled with bad writing, lazy editing and repetition (including some passages appaearing word-for-word in multiple places) make this one to pass on."
3,A somewhat touching story about survival,"Wesley Crusher, Capt. Picard and a captain crash land on a mysterious planet, which is mostly a desert. However, the craft they crashed in is damaged beyond repair, and the team begins a long march to distant mountains in search of shelter and water from the blazing sun. However, when they enter a cave, the water supply in the cave is protected by a force field, but the obsessive member attempts to disable the force field, which causes rocks falling down on the away team, and seriously wounding Picard. Wesley must get to the water soon, or Picard will die."
2,Felicitous contrivance amidst all the cliches . . .,"Pros:1) It's great to see Wesley finally gone. (ABOUT TIME!)2) There are some nice moments between him and Picard.Cons:1) Cliche after cliche2) Why is that fountain in a cave and guarded by a forcefield? Don't even ask . . .If you liked Wesley, I imagine you'll like this episode where the Boy Wonder saves the day yet again. If you didn't like him, I tend to doubt you'll find much to like here, either. But whatever your opinion of Wesley Crusher, surely the writers could have come up with something better than this?"
4,I love this chair,"I ordered 2 of these chairs - one for myself and one for my husband. They were very easy to assemble and they are exactly what we wanted for our pool. They are easy to get in and out of and we both find them comfortable. The built in cup holders are also a plus. All in all, this is a really good product for the money."
1,Buyer beward,"The first movie I watched was ""Going My Way."" It stopped half way through and would not start again. I tried it on several DVD players in my home and I also tried it on a friends DVD player and got the same results. The packaging it came it contained nothing but the DVD in its case. There was no packing slip or instructions to return the item. I'm now stuck with a DVD that's useless... a big disappointment."
2,role playing?,"Sorry all, but this game is a BIG disappointment. The graphics are lame considering the Dreamcast's processing power. There is really no role playing to be had here either.The randomly generated dungeons and idiotic leveling system make the game a bore, not to mention that the towns offer nothing but mindless text banter from uninteresting characters. This is not a good game. Hopefully we will get a real role player like the Final Fantasy series or even an installment of Y's....something! Until then, save your money."
2,Ths game wasn't very good,"THIS GAME WAS NOT UP TO MY STANDARDS, its graphics were only soso,and the entertainmet value was awful low. It doesn't stand up to the competition and no one should buy this game. The only reason i gave it two stars was because of the system that it runs on. DON'T BUY THIS GAME ITS HORRIBLE"
4,Fun Fun Fun but graphics are a bit bad,I recently got this game and it is really fun it actually has good dialogue and it has a host of characters that are actually different some game all the computer people all look the same and have the same personality ...boring. I really enjoy this game being up there with my favorite RPG games like Golden Sun and Fire emblam. Though the only drawback is the graphics they aren't DOA but they do have some cartoonish gleam too them.
3,A ... RPG Game,"Time Stalkers has some awesome ideas behind it, but it has too many problems to really recommend above your standard RPG on the PlayStation. Currently, EGG is still the only real worthwhile RPG on the system, and it's of the action variety. I actually enjoyed Time Stalkers a bit more than Evolution, primarily due to the title's original ideas. I'd definitely recommend that you hold off your cash until the real role playing games hit the system."
3,For cosy-type mystery lovers,"Knit One, Kill Two is a pretty good cosy murder mystery.I liked the characters, and for the first book in a series, I thought they were pretty well described. The plot may be familiar, but if you're a cosy mystery reader, so what? A pleasant afternoon's or evening's read."
5,a western small- town cozy mystery,"The heroine is a feisty single young woman who adjusts to some serious changes in her personal life. When her aunt is murdered, she inherits the cottage and surrounding land in Colorado far from her beloved east coast. While she intended to stay ""just long enough to settle the estate,"" she has questions about her aunt's death and finds herself stretching her allotted time in order to find the answers. The plot moves ahead quickly with frequent ""knitting breaks"" at the shop across the street, where we meet her supporting cast - a group of friends who welcome her to their small community. This is a good story in a beautiful setting - whodunnit is secondary to enjoying the search. I'm looking forward to the author's next book."
2,Just a little too convenient,"This mystery just misses the boat. I nearly gave up one it but kept reading hoping I would change my mind but I didn't. Everything was a little too convenient. Kelly's acceptance into the knitting community, her ease in digging up the clues, her DC job allowing her to work from Colorado, and Burt being a spinner. I liked the setting and the yarn shop. There were too many characters that never got fleshed out. And the final denouement was way over the top. I won't be reading any more of the series. I would recomment Monica Ferris' needlework series and Debbie Macomber's Blossom Street series over this one. While they are cozy, there are layers and character development."
4,Very enjoyable read,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author really understands a knitter's passion for color and texture. I look forward to more books in this series!
3,Knitting Mystery?,Didn't find this very exciting or thought provoking. It barely held my attention. Probably won't read any other novels by this author.
4,"Review for Knit One, Kill Two (Knitting Mystery) by Maggie Sefton","I consider Knit One, Kill Two an interesting read. The outcome is surprising. I am a knitter that is why I bought the novel in the first place. Anyone who is interested in knitting would especially enjoy it.I intend to purchase the series."
1,Gag me with a ball of yarn,"This is one of the lamest mysteries I have ever read. What's with ""she tweaked"". Is this supposed to be a cross between a squeak and a twitter. The dictionary defines 'tweak' to be a pinch or a twist. There is nothing in there to describe a voice. The plot was lame, there was little jeopardy in the so called climax and the third time the wool shop is described is one time too many. I'm afraid my writer's critque group would not have let this out the door. This book only proves that to be a best seller you only need a gimmick."
3,Could have been better,"Maggie Sefton's first of a series is acceptable but lacks writing skill. The constant repetition of dialogue between the characters displeases the reader. You spend your time saying hello and get an update on circumstances once - not character to character as each enters the shop over and over.The sensory experience of yarn color, texture and shape was pleasant but a little overdone. After finishing, and I was glad I read it, but felt the content could have been written in half the number of pages.Also, as others have written, the end was too abrupt, did not tie up loose ends (what happened to the shop lease) and surprised the reader who was fruitlessly looking for the next page. I will read her next novel, but probably with a critical eye. She is better than her editor allowed her to go to print."
4,Love to read,I love James Patterson mysteries and I tried the knitting mysteries and they are a good book and good story too. Nice to try different things.
3,Pleasantly Entertaining,"I'm a mystery snob, I admit it. I'm also a yarn snob. Put the two together, and maybe I'm not going to be the easiest critic of a knitting mystery. All the same, ""Knit One, Kill Two"" was a pleasant -- if not entirely convincing -- mystery. The plot was so-so -- I know you need to suspend disbelief in a ""cozy"" series, but the coincidences here went a bit over the edge. But I liked the majority of the characters, who were well-developed, and the knitting setting was intriguing. Only a three-star review, but I will check out the next in the series."
1,Cashing In on the Knitting Craze,"To my mind, this is a fairly blatant attempt at cashing in on the current knitting craze. Apparently the author was quite dazzled by her first entry into a well-stocked yarn shop, as she tells us over and over again about the kaleidoscope of color and the multitude of yarns that invite touching. There's a mystery plot of sorts, but I can't help wondering whether the author began as a romance writer. It's a pleasant book, though, and if you like Debbie Macomber's knitting-shop books, you'll probably enjoy it."
3,very pedestrian,"Not bad for a first attempt, but very pedestrian writing. Lots of descriptive detail isn't what drives a really good book. I skipped to the back to see whodunnit."
2,Nancy Drew Learns to Knit,"A pleasant little book about a stranger learning to fit into a strange (to her) world. Set in an attractive-sounding Colorado community populated by sincere characters, this book never grabbed my interest as a mystery."
1,"Cardboard characters, paper-thin plot","I find nothing to recommend in this book. The characters are one-dimensional. The main character drops into a ready-made supportive community at a yarn shop, where she can indulge in one-way friendships, but the knitting sections are not realistic. The solving of the central mystery is not believable. The author seems to have picked out several trends (knitting, coffee-drinking) and tried to make the book popular by incorporating them, but the overall effect is boring."
5,Wonderful Ballet Class,"This video takes you through an intermediate ballet class. David demonstrates the combinations, and seven professional dancers perform them. I am currently an advanced ballet student who lives far away from a professional studio. I do this ballet class video on days when I can't make it to the studio. David Howard has many other great ballet class videos available to aspiring dancers and dance teachers who want to learn ballet technique."
4,Fast!,"This DVD is definitively for intermediate/advanced. But if you have taken a class (or 20) and go through it a few times, you will get it!"
3,Good if you can get them going,"These reeds push out a huge volume of sound. The sound is very nice, and they are particularly great in long-length practice chanters.Unfortunately I'm not strong enough to keep these going for any amount of time so I can't play them, but if you're a bit stronger these are definitely worth a look."
2,Not an all day chair,This is a sturdy chair but it's not very comfortable. You wouldn't want to sit in this chair for more than an hour at a time. It's definitely not an all day office chair. It's better to suited to situations where the person doesn't need to sit for long.
1,comfortable compared to what?,"I bought this chair as a christmas gift for my fiance. After putting it together (which was easy) I sat in it, and hated it. The cushion is hard, and the back is uncomfortable. I felt like I was going to slide right out of it. I am not even going to bother giving it as a gift..."
1,Back to Basics-Making things that DON'T Work!,"Save your money, this is a piece of junk. It's broken THREE times and they just send out the replacement part and won't replace the unit itself. This is poorly designed and continues to break. Their motto is: Back to Basics-Making things that work! It should be: Back To Basics-MAKING THINGS THAT DON'T WORK AND WE DON'T CARE ONCE WE GET YOUR MONEY! It's very apparent to me that their Customer Service Department could care less-- I had to give this unit a one star because Amazon rates from 1 to 5 but it really rates a ZERO!"
2,Same OLD Story.,"Like many of you, my spout tab broke off as well, but the company was willing to replace it quickly. I did expect a higher quality machine for this much money and was a really disappointed when this arrived so I'm giving it only 2 stars. I do use mine daily and have for about 6 months now. The machine is incredibly loud but it is powerful enough and then some, still next time I'll go with a name I know and can trust."
1,Shelly,"Same problem as others. Smoothie leaks out ALL over the counter. Good motor, but cheep plastic parts do not hold up. I've used mine @ 10 times and a plastic part on blade assembly already broke. Not going to pay to get it fixed after reading other reviews!"
1,Avoid.,"Review of the Back to Basics Smoothie Pro 700, which I own.The motor is too small. It overheats and creates a very poisonous-seeming smell. There are no standards for rating motors. ""Peak Power"" may be only the power the motor can draw for one second before burning.There is a hole in the base, where the plastic jar fits. Liquid can easily flow into that hole, creating a place for fungus and bacteria to breed. The liquid can apparently flow onto the motor area.The silver color is just silver-colored plastic.The blender blades screw into the plastic jar with threads that go the opposite direction that is standard. Counter-clockwise tightens, not loosens.At high speed the blender vibrates very loudly and violently. Sometimes the vibration causes the blender blade to unscrew itself from the jar. If that happens, the contents flows to the counter and the floor. (That happened to me today.)"
2,could not hold my interest,"Generally, I quite like Cameron's books--this is the first that failed to grab my attention and hold it--but it did fail. I found the conversations stilted and the rate of action both slow and uneven. Not her usual, for sure. The 2 main characters should have been interesting, but struck me more as ""along for the ride"" rather than being the ride. I give Cameron credit for some interesting side characters (Fr. Cyrus and ""Wazoo"") but secondary characters do not make or break a novel."
1,Really bad book,"This book MIGHT have been passable if it was about 250 pagesshorter. It seemed like the author had nothing to really doso she just filled the pages with nonsense and way toomany ridiculous characters. Although the book starts out witha murder, which I thought might prove intersting, I was wrong.200 pages later I couldn't care less who committed the murder,if Spike and Vivian ever figured out their attraction ormuch else about this bunch of nonsense. I'm truly amazedthat anyone is still publishing this writer in hardcover,thank god I only bought a paperback, next time I'll knownot to even bother with that."
1,a serious question for someone who finished this book,"This is my first experience with Ms Cameron. On page 17 of the paperback version, there is a murder. Does anything else ever actually happen in this book because I've read 150 more pages and since the murder, characters wander in and out but nothing much happens. If the rest of the book is simply characters wandering around, I really don't want to waste the time. I'm not sure what she's trying to accomplish unless padding to proper length was the goal of the middle of the book but seriously, does this book have a raison d'etre? If anyone can convince me, I'll finish it and reevaluate it."
1,Convoluted,"I have never written a review before in my life. However, I have found this book to be one of the worst books I have ever read so I decided to give it a review. I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing this book. It does not even deserve a 1 star rating. I am halfway through the book and still don't know exactly what the author is trying to say. All the funny town names and secondary characters make the story line and plot difficult to keep up with. The author would have done better if she had gotten rid of the so called thriller plot line and just made the book a straight our romance story. The book could have been cut down to about 100 or so pages. I am so glad I bought the paperback and not the hardcover. As it is I want my money back."
3,Off with his head!,"He was exactly what we expected. Until his head fell off as soon as my grandson began to play with him. I glued the head back on with Norbond and allowed the little guy to play with him next day, with strict instructions not to wiggle his head, and so far so good. But really! I'm not sure what held the head on in the first place. There was a cone-shaped appendage on top of the torso that fit into a cone-shaped hole under the head, but there was nothing that would enable them to snap together. What was this manufacturer thinking? Or did we just get a defective Ben?"
4,ARE THEY BRIAN&DAVID? U HAVE TO BUY IT,"DAVID BYRNE AND BRIAN ENO DO ALWAYS GOOD THINGS . THEY WERE BEGIN TO WORK TOGETHER WITH TALKING HEADS . AFTER DAVID FINISHED THE BAND , HE MAKES SOME ETHNIC MUSIC.THIS ALBUM IS AN GOOD EXAMPLE FOR ""AFRO-ETHNIC-NEW WAVE-POST PUNK"" . I LOVE IT !"
5,groundbreaking and mesmerizing,"If you're fond of Moby's ""Play,"" you'll love this album. Decades before Moby decided to take creaky old gospel wails and blues hollers and fuse them onto gleaming, haunted electronic grooves, Brian Eno and David Byrne were doing exactly the same thing--only with even more imagination. Behind the funky musical backdrop of ""My Life in the Bush of Ghosts"" you'll hear TV chatter, Arabic chants, exorcisms, random shouts. It's truly a wild ride--like a quantum-leaping psychic journey from Mississippi to Mecca to Manhattan and then finally all the way up to a mountain in rural Japan. If you're at all curious about the roots of ambient music, electronica, sampling, ""world beat""--well, Byrne and Eno paved the way for a lot of those genres with this gorgeous, hypnotic album. Check it out."
5,Required listening,"O.K. , so maybe I'm a bit prejudiced, being a Talking Heads fan, (actually, in the 80's when they were popular, I didn't ""get"" them, couldn't get past David Byrne's voice) but I feel this recording is to the 80's what the ""White Album"" was to the 60's. To clarify, the influence it had on musicians changed the way people thought about modern music. Anyone involved in Techno, Jungle, House, etc. owe so much to this record. It's influece was HUGE but although it influenced many musicians, it never really reached the ears af the average pop listener because it was too ahead of it's time for 80's FM radio. One thing that amazes me is that the ""samples"" used were done the hard way, with tape and a razor blade to splice then in among other things. Now anyone with a halfway decent computer could do the same but most still don't sound as fresh and thought provoking as this masterpiece."
3,AAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHHH!,INSTRUCTIONS: SET ALARM CLOCK TO 1:00 A.M. IMMEDIATLEY GET OUT OF BED PLAY THIS DISC WITHOUT TURNING ON THE LIGHTS WHILE DRINKING LARGE GLASS OF STRONG COFFEE YOU WILL GO MAD FAST
4,Cruisy chill-out CD,"When I first heard this in a CD shop, it put a smile on my face. It was pure feel-good music.I work at home and D'Nell comes on when I'm finished my working day and ready for some refreshment and relaxation.When it the next CD out?"
2,Controls need help,"I have consistently purchased EA's NHL games since the debut on Genesis. When the GBC version came out, I had hope that it would translate fairly well. Games on GBC tend to be very simple and easy which leads to plenty of fun. Unfortunately, they tried to do too much for this game. The controls are extremely slow, the gameplay is very choppy (turn offsides off), and there are some unwelcome bugs and chop in the graphics. This game could have been done better for the GBC."
4,Genesis hockey is back!,"When I bought NHL 2000, like everyone else, I was hoping to be taken back to those good old Genesis days and for the most part I was. I can understand how people could criticize the control but if your a real NHL Genesis fan you'll have no problem adjusting to the controls and having hours of fun with this game. I was very pleased with the graphics with the individual players and I also liked all the updated teams and players. So if you're looking for a game to give you a taste of Genesis type fun pick NHL 2000."
2,"not bad, not great either","being used to the PS version, perhaps i was expecting a bit more. still, there is much room for improvement here. players are annoyingly stupid in this version. they jump the blueline *all* the time or just take a nap in the offensive zone causing many offsides calls. also, pulling the goalie seems to work infrequently at best (my shootout mode doesn't work at all, so maybe i should be happy.) having the check and speedup buttons combined can be very frustrating - you try to check your man and end up flying past him down the ice. that all said, it still can be a pretty fun game. just don't expect too much."
2,Not Really Balanced,"I was truly looking for a balanced book that would give me the best arguments of both sides (or even additional sides if there are any.)However, the essays used for equality were not nearly the best available. The book's compilers did not include a single essay where the authors were both for equality AND were believers in Biblical inerrancy (and, yes, there are people who fit this description.)Not to mention that the essays were really quite dry and uninteresting."
3,Read Once In A Blue Moon,"While this story and the series it is from are entertaining, it is not a keeper for me.I have read it once and have no idea where the book is now in the house, ask me where my Lora Leigh books are and I will find them in minutes.I would recommend instead buying this story in eBook format which is cheaper and more economical for a story you only read 'Once In A Blue Moon'"
1,DON'T BET ON THIS MOVIE,WHY WOULD TWO L.A. LAW CAST MEMBERS STAR IN A MOVIE AS THIS? THIS IS DREADFUL & A WASTE OF TIME. EVEN BEN STEIN & JIMMY KIMMEL KNOW ABOUT THIS.
1,"Never received the phone, but was charged for it.","Ordered the phone in January. We never received it, but were charged. Cannot contact the company just as the other reviewer said. They do not answer the phone or email. Nothing but a recording which routes you to a mailbox that is full."
3,Price Phister upgrade kit,"The Danco 89436 trim kit was very easy to install. Everything went together very well and my customer was happy with it. I have only (2) complaints about this product:(1) This product is advertised as Brushed Nickel but the ""Brushed"" look could be a little more defined. It looks more like its just a dull metal finish.(2) The tub spout sprays the water out rather than a steady steam as if its restricted somehow.I took it off and examined it and it looks to be ok. I guess its just the way its designed. Need more work on this Danco"
1,did not fit well,"item did not fit well with my fixtures. like the previous comment, the parts were cheaply made."
3,watch out,"i'm not sure if it has been fixed for the games ... is shipping, but my version of ""the meaning of life"" can't be won. seriously. unless you use a special cheat that takes you to the debug mode a fatal bug in the game will not let you finish. to top it off, i can't find any support or patches for this bug on the web, only other people upset about it. the game is great up until about the very last scene, but once you get stuck it's extremely agrivating. great game, but the quality control at panasonic interactive media needs to all be fired, and then someone needs to tell us all how to fix the game. ugh."
5,Insider's Review,"I worked this case and know all of the people mentioned in the book. This is a very accurate portrayal of the events, including things that went well and things that did not go well in the investigation. Offers insight into problems within the criminal justice system."
2,need better quality control,"this *could* be a great music player. works with linux, supports open formats, audiophile features (speed control, advanced playlist features, advanced EQ), etc. those are the ""pros."" ""cons"" include: why is FM radio reception an option and not standard? also, why not have a speed control that's independent of pitch change? the technology for this has been around for at least 10 years now...my main complaint about this unit is that i've gotten two bad ones from J&R; returning the second one tomorrow. the first one crapped out after about 2 weeks, and the second one refuses to power up after only two days.trekstor tech support answers emails promptly enough, but their advice doesn't go much beyond suggestions to update the firmware (although i told them that both of my vibezs shipped with the latest firmware already installed).i'm going to try one more time, because i think this could be the best alternative to the iPod that's out there. wish me luck!"
5,"Very informative, even though I have version 4.5","Vety information, easy to read, and full of useful information. Lots of basics, and excellent tips and suggestions. I learned lots about the Web and HTML (even though I knew both already) while learning HomeSite with this book."
5,Design GREAT sites in no-time.,"Ben Forta has done it again. This is a GREAT book to teach yourself HTML and HOMESITE. In 24 hours you'll be fluent in html and the great editor -Allaire's Homesite. Even if you know HTML, this book is a great reference tool. If you truly want to build great sites, read Ben's book and throw away Microsoft FrontPage, you'll thank yourself, and your website visitors will thank you"
2,No better than the 4.5 PDF download.,I was dissapointed in that the book mirrored the freely available help files. Certainly not worth the cost when compared with free information.
5,Ben Does it Again!,"Thank heavens for Ben Forta's books! Homesite is great, but a book by someone who knows the application like the back of his hand, inside and out, but can write a guide in plain english, makes the experience complete! Don't build your website without it!"
3,My First HomeSite Book,"I borrowed this book from the local library. Actually I was looking for the HomeSite 4.5 for the dummies, but had to settle for this one since I couldn't find it. The book says teach yourself in 24 hours and I think it really meant it. I managed to digest most of them in a few days working to about 24 hours in all. It's a very simple book to teach you the fundamentals on HomeSite. I found it to be too brief in some of the topics. Just teach you the most basic stuff. It could be better if the book could give more examples. In summary, this is a good book if you just want to know how do get started. You will still need another book on HTML to do the more advanced stuff."
4,Savings of Time and Effort,"I have been a self-taught user of HomeSite for quite awhile now. I attended a HomeSite class but it was just too basic. I wanted to beef up my html pages with Image Maps and create forms which allowed for multiple selections.I searched the web for the information but wound up going back to the HomeSite book. It was quite easy to find the answers I was looking for.There are a few things that bother me about HomeSite such as, if I create an html file and save it into the directory, the file doesn't show immediately. Instead of looking for an answer in the book to that question, I figure it is something I would need to take up with Allaire Technical Support - the owners of HomeSite.But, overall, the book has been a great savings of my time and effort and I'm pleased to have it in my library!!"
5,Only 5 Stars it should be at least 6 Stars,"After developing hundreds of websites, and purchased all the major website HTML develomental programs. I tossed them all for Homesite. In a sentence, ""It's truly a professional web developer's tool, but easy enough for anyone to use."" It is more than an editor. I've been using it since version 1.0, and I still haven't learned or used all of it's capabilities. I have tons of cgi, java, and html code in ""snippets"" and I plug and play many modules. It's a must for any one who wants to develop professional sites. It's power with ease of use. If you are going to buy any HTML editor, it's got to be this one."
2,Missing and broken pieces,"This is a great game for adults and children alike. However I would NEVER purchase anything from this company again!!! The ""Double 12"" domino was completely missing from the set. The train hub does not make sounds as it should, even after changing the battery. The inner sleeve that holds everything in place inside the zipper case arrived cracked so they pieces slide around. VERY POOR QUALITY!!!!!"
2,"Buy ""Midnight Rambler"" Instead!","Despite the addition of Lefty Dizz as a second guitarist, which, given Louisiana Red's limited abilities on the instrument, one would think would be a positive, the lyrical content and intensity that is present on many of the songs on ""Midnight Rambler"" is largely absent here. However, ""Too Poor To Die"" and ""Cold White Sheet"" are great. As a side note, do not see Red perform live as he is elderly and not in the best of shape. It's better to remember him as the great storyteller he was on ""Midnight Rambler"" than to tarnish his image."
2,Just don't use them for woodworking,"I don't know who Scott Phillips is but he sure isn't a woodworker. These clamps jamb up at the first little bit of glue on the bar and are incredibly frustrating. When I need to glue up a piece I reach for the Besseys, then the Jorgie's, then those big heavy old round bar clamps, then, if I still don't have enough clamps I reluctantly use these. But I'd never buy them again."
3,Old school,"If you are an 80's baby this will bring great memory back to you. The power of the 5 armory will have you "" weeping with fear "" . Inside jk ... It was a great DVD set and I will always remember the good times with this series."
3,It's ok,"I thought I would be getting 2 books from this but all I just got was one instead of 2,I also got an email saying it was shipped out the day I order it but it really wasn't shipped out until the 28th instead,the dvds work great but I would reconmend on buy from another seller instead of this person here.Plus I have to buy the other 4 volumes cause the one I have only comes with 6.To other buyers who like anime I would suggest not to buy off this seller."
3,this item is not as picture,"have not watched it yet but beware it is the bootleg version if it says samurai troopers and comes in to boxes. the one from bandai like pictured is one box only ths it say complete collection on cover. i will have to choke up and accept it as i like the series and it is really hard to find as for some reason bandai discontinued it. even though it was one of the anime that put anime in the main stream. ronin warriors is up there with dbz,sailor moon,pokemon that started the rush of popularity of anime. if you want the bandai box set look somewhere else. if you are just tired of trying to find it cave and by this."
3,I Changed My Opinion of this C.D.!!,"When I first bought this C.D., I was annoyed and disappointed with the songs and skits. I thought that the humor was terribly immature and stupid. But, after afew more listenings, I have changed my mind. It's kinda like the more you listen to it, the more you appreciate it. The songs began to grow on me, and I couldn't help laughing outloud after awhile. Sometimes the stuff's actually funny (like the buffoon tracks!) and sometimes it's just so stupid and sickening that you can't help but laugh. It's really a pretty good comedy C.D."
4,A few tracks worth the price,"Although alot of the tracks on this CD are sophomorish and lame, the gems outweigh them. Lunchlady Land, the Thanksgiving Song and (my all-time favorite)Tollbooth Willie are clever and hilarious! If I lost my disc I would have to go buy it again just for those three tracks. I haven't heard anything else by Adam (and friends) that even comes close to being as funny as this disc."
2,"Funny the first few times, but gets really old fast","OK. I'll give it to Adam. THe album made me laugh the first couple times that I heard it, but then just was plain out not funny and very annoying. Clever, yet insanely vulger and repetive. Stop with the bafoon! It's so annoying! Among the few really good ones are all of the beatings of school teachers/staff. That's about it. I took away a star for every reason that this album sholdn't be bought. 1. The never ending vulgarity is sickening. 2. REPEDITIVE! 3. The amount of tracks on this album. In other words, barrow it from a friend or something because this album isn't worth even $5."
1,"Extremely vulgar, wears on you after awhile","In person, or on screen, I think Adam Sandler is one of the funniest, most gifted situation comics. But, this CD simply doesn't capture his talents. The vulgarity and repetitive nature of several of the tracks quickly became juvenile. I still haven't listened to the entire CD because I know the last tracks are just more of the same."
2,Sandler,"Basically, all I wanted off this disc were two or three songs. The rest is typical Adam Sandler juvenile mush. Enter at your own risk !!! LoL"
3,Adam Sandler is better scene and heard in movies.,"The CD only offers one funny track (Bufoon) Otherwise, Sandler is boring and unfunny."
2,Little Replay Value,"This got old REALLY quickly. With the exception of his songs, which are entertaining, there's little replay value, here. I thought this was great when I was in high school. You know what they say about hindsight..."
3,Pretty good,"I thought this CD was very good at first but after listening to it, it began to get boring."
5,They're all gonna laugh at you! BUY IT !,"I have all three of his cd's and this one is the best. The buffoon still cracks me up after I've listened to it a million times. I think Adam sandler should do a skit with the buffoon and the goat in it. The goat is from his second cd, What the Hell happened to me. BUY IT."
1,A Perfect Example of the Decline of Comedy,"The sounds of a man urinating for a lengthy period of time; the repeatitive sounds of people being beaten; the voice a man pretending to be ""wasted""; people cursing a toll both operator; all included here for your listening disappointment. Adam Sandler's ""comedy"" album ""They're All Gonna Laugh At You"" is a great example of why comedy seems to be dead; it should be obvious, but the definition of comedy is not: cuss words and bodily functions with no flexibility, punch lines, or commentary whatsoever. Much in the same vein as Sandler's other attempts at comedy albums, with poor results. The ""jokes"" consist of pure immaturity, and not in the perfected comic manner. For teenagers looking for a quick giggle only."
4,It was alright....,"I thought that this cd was funny in places, and in others it was just plain stupid. Some of the funnier tracks are ""The Assistant Principals Big Day"", ""Toll Booth Willie"" and my all time favorite: ""I'm so wasted."" ""the longest Pee"" was extremely Stupid, as were the 3 or 4 Buffoon encounters. I really like the severe beating episodes, but they are too short and consist of only sound effects, no spoken words."
5,Hystericaly enjoyable,"This CD is extremely funny, and has and urbane humor to it. Overall a great buy."
5,In Lunchlady Land your Dreams come true!,"I love this cd! lunchlady land is the funniest! Trust me, BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,BEST SANDLER CD,I have listened to all the adam sandler cds and this is the best. Listen toLunchlady LandMedium PaceThe Buffoon SkitsAssistant Principal's Big DayMr. Spindel's Phone Call (this one cracks me up every time)I'm So WastedThe Beatingsbuy this CD today!
2,Not comliant with new DST changeover,"I bought one of these earlier in the year to replace a similar, older model whose LCD display had become unreadable. On the whole it's a nicer, better product, but I got a rude awakening when the new DST changeover in March took place. Using atomic time, the device did not advance one hour and stayed an hour behind. Fine, I thought; until April I will turn off the (""optional"") atomic time and set the clock ahead 1 hour manually. When I went to sleep, all seemed OK - but I've been an hour late for work twice already because, in the wee hours of the morning, atomic time ""auto-magically"" gets turned on again (despite my turning it off) and the clock goes back 1 hour. As a result the alarm goes off 1 hour late, and I'm late again for work."
1,Go somewhere else,"I bought 5 of these for myself and my kids and grandma. None of the 5 have worked correct. but alas - since they were Christmas gifts, the 30 day send back policy has gone by the wayside.Unless you like to jump out of bed at 7 in the morning when it is really still only 3am, go somewhere else. would be alot easier to buy electronic stuff from a local store where you can walk back in with it for a refund. Amazon is good for books, but think twice before getting something prone to break."
1,I should have read the reviews on Amazon first!,"This item is a complete failure. My wife and I live in Colorado, so the atomic clock signal shouldn't be a problem. However, even when setting the right time zone, the clock still changes time randomly. Also, when I shut off the atomic clock feature, it still attempts to contact the atomic clock on occasion and literally crashes the clock, that is, all the lights flash green and the clock ceases to work. At this point, a hard reset is required where the clock must be powered down for several hours. I'm going back to my $5 digital clock from Wal-Mart. At least it actually tells time!"
2,Too Bright!,"Nice features, just not well thought out. The LCD display as well as the ceiling display is so bright it lights up the bedroom at night. I have to put a wash cloth over it in order to go to sleep. Of course that defeats the purpose of having one. The buttons are positioned so that when you press them, it slides the clock backwards forcing you to use both hands to do anything with the clock...one to hold it still and the other to press the buttons. My primary reason for purchasing this clock was to get the outside temperature displayed on the ceiling. Now I'm going to have to buy another one."
3,HoMedics Sound Radio and Clock,The Radio and Clock is an average unit slightly over priced. In most cases the exterior temperature monitor does not work. I think for children and older people wanting a toy this is okay. I rate it as an average consumer product.T-Five
2,Light's too bright!!! Snooze button is hard to find!!!,I've had this clock for a while now and I still don't like it for many reasons. The snooze button was so hard to find at the beginning. After I don't know how many months I was finally able to hit it in the right place. If you are sensitive to light forget about getting this clock. There is not one setting that has a tolerable amount of brightness. The low/high settings for the back light are super bright and even the projection light is super bright for both my husband and myself. And as for the atomic time setting the other day the clock set itself back one hour and I ended up waking up an hour late. I was late to work!!! All in all you're better off with a regular alarm clock. Not worth the money.
1,Piece of Junk,"I loved the features of this alarm clock, but I give up.The first time I bought this clock the remote temperature sensor did not work consistently. It would not always transmit the temperature, even if it was a foot away from the clock. I returned it.The second time I bought it, the projector for the time and temperature was missing parts of the digits, so you cannot actually read either time or temp. This when the clock was brand new.DO NOT BUY THIS LOW QUALITY PIECE OF JUNK"
2,Doesn't keep time,"The 'atomic' time set checks every night and cannot be disabled. Every couple months, it sets the wrong time. Can't rely on it as an alarm clock."
2,Not for the long haul,"I like Homedics clock radio alarms for the nature sounds. Invariably, though, it conks out in a year or less. On this one, the time zone button started flipping out, so when it's really 10:30 the clock shows 11:30, or 9:30 (this creates havoc when I set my alarm - I think it's 6:30am but it's really 7:30am because the freakin' time zone has changed again). Homedics, get your act together!!"
2,NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE,I can't read the projected time or temperature because it isn't bright enough.Also the projection can't be pointed FORWARD in front of the clock so you would have to look BEHIND you to see it. Kinda a pain when you are in bed. Also the clock face is really bright so it acts like a night light right next to the bed. This is not a positive for me. I would not have bought it if I knew this but I didn't buy from Amazon so can't return it.
1,piece of @#$%,"Iam now on my third one of these useless things.The first one never read outdoor temperature correctly.The second one did nothing right out of the box,and now the backlight display just quit on the third.As if that's not bad enough, I was just told that I am over my original warranty of 1 year,and that doesn't transfer to the replacement units.Good Riddance!"
1,A lot of money for a cheap product,"First off, the worst thing about it is that the Buzzer is linked to the main volume. So if you want nice soft nature sounds to fall asleep to, you can forget about the alarm waking you up. Also, don't believe the pictures. The backlight for the clock is not a nice solid one like you see on the box. Its some screen with little holes in it with a light behind it. The whole thing feels cheap too. The Nature sounds do sound ok though."
3,"Great features, but atomic time seems glitchy","I've had this clock for several months, and I like most things about it. However, the clock has reset itself (three times, lately) to 40 minutes fast, so I've had a little surprise when I get up in the morning. (better than 40 minutes slow, I suppose). Turning off the atomic clock feature does not seem to work - it turns itself back on within the next several hours.The other features - indoor-outdoor temp, ability to turn off all lighting - radio, sounds - work great and I really like them."
2,Great feature set - if yours works!,"Loved the feature set, but I had two that ultimately died on me within 2 weeks (LEDs flashed and the digital display was stuck on 88:88). What good is an alarm clock you can't trust??"
3,Not bad,"I did like the all the features this product offered but the main reason I bought it is because when I take my glasses off at night I can't see my clock. Although it has a large clock display, all I can see if the bright light. The numbers are not lite up at all so I may be returning this product"
1,WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!!,"I cannot honestly believe that an alarm clock cannot keep accurate time. Isn't that ITS MAIN JOB???? I received this clock as a Christmas gift, and it has not worked at all. I can't rely on this clock...sometimes it is two hours off, sometimes it is ten minutes off. Please do not waste your money on this junk."
1,Don't waste your money,"This clock would be a great item if it worked properly. I purchased this clock in Sept. and loved the features! The lowest setting on the radio and sounds was way too loud but I loved the other features and accepted the problem. It worked fine until November. The clock automatically goes back one hour every day so I have to keep checking the time. When it goes back one hour at night, of course the alarm goes off one hour LATER than it should. The atomic clock does not work anymore. HoMedics customer service recommended that I set the clock ahead two hours every day so that it would be correct time. But NO!, the clock goes back TWO hours so it is still wrong. Should I have to reset the clock everyday and always double check the time on a $49 item???"
1,Worst alarm clock ever!,"The main reason I got this clock is for the automatic updating and the outside temp sensor. Ever since daylight savings time took effect a few months ago it hasn't been right. Will appear correct before bed then you go to wake up and it has changed through the night!! Arrr. Outside temp sensor doesn't work when it gets below about 40 degrees. If the sun shines on it, it will read 90 when its only 50."
1,I returned the item to the store after 2 months,"I purchased the ss-5000 at Kohls on sale for $40.00 in November 2006. Didn't use it until Christmas. I recently returned the item to the store after 2 months of use. The volume knob didn't work right and the time would jump back two hours from 9 PM until 4 AM.My volume knob had a good usable range for one month, then it started going only from loud to louder. It would go back to normal by jiggling it. I contacted Homedics only to find out that they had no plans of ever fixing these design flaws. I won't be purchasing it again. Too bad it didn't work, I can't find another alarm clock with outside temperature for $40. I guess there is a reason for that."
1,Don't buy it's a waste,"A terrible product with a high price. The illuminate setting casts a way too bright glare from the LCD screen, great for a night light if your afraid of the dark. During the first day in use the nature sounds would suddenly turn on by itself and then the time would change to an incorrect time. I believe the Atomic Time feature caused this but after I switched this feature off it would turn back on again. I will be returning this garbage after only two days."
1,Do not buy it!,"There are two problems I have with this clock.The first one that bothered me was the fact that when you set a volume for the ""white noise"" feature at night, it uses that volume for the wake up alarm. Sorry, but I would like low volume at night for the white noise, but an increasing at least volume in the morning. This uses your night time setting for both. How stupid is that?Also, this clock did not reset for Daylight Saving Time, but is seems to set an hour ahead or behind all year long, at random.DO NOT COUNT ON THIS CLOCK IF YOU NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE ON TIME!Too bad. The indoor and outdoor temp feature seems to work, if you DO NOT CARE WHAT TIME IT IS."
2,Not as happy as I thought I would be,"First, I love the nature sounds! They are realistic, soothing and with no noticable repeat. The ceiling projection is great also.I am disappointed that you cannot adjust the volume down below a certain level. It makes the radio too loud to use to fall asleep by.I also had problems with the time changing randomly. I solved that problem by turning off the atomic clock sensor, but that was part of the reason I bought this clock.I probably could have bought a different Homedics projection clock but this was the only one with dual alarms."
2,I wish I had purchased a different item,"I have the same problem one reviewer mentioned -- the clock seems to reset itself by one hour, from time to time with no apparent reason. I didn't realize this until I got up one hour late one morning! And, as another reviewer mentioned, it's very bright. We turned the light off and use only the projection feature.We needed the two alarm feature, but it's not easy to set. It seems like it wouldn't be too hard, but we still seem to have problems with it. Sometimes we think it's on, but it's not. None of this is really a good situation if you need the alarm clock to wake you up at a certain time in the morning. We've started setting a travel alarm as a back-up.On the brighter side, the temperature feature is nice and the radio reception is fairly clear. Those aren't the most important things I am looking for in a clock radio."
3,"Works as expected, just not as desired","All the features on this clock work as advertised, and the automatic time set finally provided a way to keep my wife from intentionally setting the clock 5-15 minutes fast. Unfortunately, there are a number of things that were not as I had hoped:1) changing the time the alarm is set is very difficult, and requires pressing extremely small and awkward buttons2) the projector lights up the room far too much3) the focus knob is poorly implemented and doesn't really work4) the nature sounds are absurdly loud and really artificial5) there is no back button when setting the time or alarm, causing one to have to go all the way around if they miss the number the first tryThis clock is going to be returned as soon as I find a replacement."
2,"Buttons, buttons who has the buttons.","This clock has the finest example of technology gone wild. First, I wanted a projection clock that gave me indoor tempature and projected on the ceiling along with the time. Not this projection clock=it was on the face of the clock. Second the projection arm was in the back of the clock, not along side where I could point the projection where I wanted it. This little baby has forward motion blocked by the body of the clock radio. Finally, the number of buttons that controlled the clock and the number of options for sweet sounds of nature was overwhelming. I tried to set an alarm and that failed for some reason=wrong button, moon not in proper alignment with the stars-who knows. Overall, this product was a bust and I returned it. However, I am still trying to get my shipping costs back since the problem was not mine since the marketing implied that it has a projection of the indoor tempeture, which it did not."
1,Worst clock ever,"Worst problem: changes time, even with the satellite update option turned off. A clock that makes you think it's an hour earlier that it really is can really screw up a person's life! I've tried numerous times to fix this issue, assuming that the clock is resetting itself but not to daylight savings time. I've turned off the satellite feature but the problem still occurs. For this reason, I threw it away rather than donate it. No one needs a clock like this.Other issues: the buttons are too tiny to use if you are actually going to use this as an alarm clock. The ceiling display did become more difficult to read over time. The outside thermometer never worked from day one. Tried numerous ways to fix this with no luck."
2,Faulty clock with limited useful life,"At first I really liked this clock, it has a great range of nature sounds & you can control the volume of each.However, the backlight is crazy bright on either setting. I'm a light sleeper and would not recommend this alarm if you like to check the time at night. Even the alarm active light which is pretty small is bright, I had to turn it away from me at night.The temperature indoor setting worked, but the outdoor worked for a couple of monthes and then died...granted I live in Maine and the temps get pretty low, but still.The time setting buttons never worked very well, and now have lost all practical use. No matter how hard or frequently you push them, they won't change the time/alarm. I'm chucking this sucker after two years of unsatisfactory use."
2,Wow! This clock is difficult to use.,"I never write reviews but I had to weigh in on this one. Yowza this clock is wonky. It's difficult to program. It sometimes resets itself - and, no, not on the hour as advertised. Mysteriously it will turn off. I had to plead with the projector to get it to work. The alarms go off randomly even though I had them set for morning (4 a.m.) they go off at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. at night. I love the idea of this clock. The rainforest sounds are great. However, the execution sucks."
1,Poor Design,"Nice clock, but very poor design. The buttons to set the time are right in front and cannot be locked out, so if you pick up the clock, it will change the time. Setting the alarm is problematic also as it uses the same buttons and the timer for the alarm set ends too soon. The result is that you end up changing the clock time instead of the alarm time.I also experienced the clock randomly changing the time. These changes were usually several hours different than actual time, glad my wife has another clock that works. Did like the indoor/outdoor temp, but the projector was weak and really not worth it.I would not recommend this unit."
2,Not worth buying,"I purchased this at Big Lots. Atomic timer keeps changing the times. It can be 6 hours off, 3 hours, etc. I have it set for the right time and time zone and it still doesnt work.I had a difficult time trying to unscrew the 4 screws in the back of the remote sensor. After an hour and my wrist hurting, I gave up.I use it primarily because of the sleep sounds, they are not bad though there are other brands which give a more realistic sound.If you are really looking for a clock/alarm, do not buy this."
4,HoMedics SS-5000 Sound Spa,Item was as stated. It was shipped quickly.I would order from this person again.
1,Poor quality,"1)The clock loses the atomic radio signal unless its VERY close to a window.2)The projection digits failed within one week of owning it. Now all it projects is a bunch of digital ""8""s.3) The front display is difficult to read from any angle.Would not recommend this product in the least."
1,Same Problems,"I have had the same problems as the other reviewers. Volume is not always adjustable and has even changed from soft to loud by itself in the middle of the night, waking me up. The time zone has also changed randomly on their own. Very disappointing, especially for the price!"
3,made cheap,only 1 volume control so if u wanna fall a sleep with the radio on low then u wont wake up from a loud alarm because the volume for the radio is the same dial as the alarm
3,Best deal for time and temperature projection,"Pros:- projects time and indoor/outdoor temperatures on wall or ceiling so it is easily visible from bed without turning over or reaching or squinting or waking your partner to ask- so many features- especially like alarm options - buzzer or radio, or wake gently to any of 6 nature soundsCons:- radio sound and analog tuner are only satisfactory; the audio quality is not why I bought the system. However, I would've paid over $100 for a small system that combines all the other features of this product with great sound for the AM/FM radio and nature sounds"
3,easily broken,This product is fairly good at what it is advertized to do. It dropped a foot onto the carpet and the digital display won't work now. It still projects onto the ceiling. There is a lot of static from both the radio and the sounds
2,Volume does not turn all the way down,I am very disappointed with this product for a couple of reasons.1) The volume can not be turned down to the level I would like.2) Inside and outside temperatures's are very inaccurate.3) Nature sounds are very repetitive.
1,Homedics projection clock radio,This was the biggest waste of money. The projection didn't work for more than a couple of days and this wasn't returnable to the seller. Don't waste your money buying HoMedics. Look for another manufacturer
2,Not Great,"I have only had this product for about a week, although I do not like it already. The outdoor sensor is close to 20 degrees off and it is less then 10 feet from the base. The rest of the unit is okay. I just wanted a sound machine, but I bought this one because of the temp. For that reason it only deserves two stars. I cannot say how it will work in a few months or if I will keep it."
2,"Soothing Sounds, but Not Dependable Alarm Clock","My husband and I loved this alarm clock when we first received it as a wedding gift. The optional sounds are soothing to fall asleep to and not abrasive to wake up to in the morning. However, the clock is NOT dependable. No matter how many times I turn off the atomic clock function, it automatically comes back on.My husband and I exchanged the original clock for a new one, thinking there was an issue with the warranty on the first one. After about two months, the atomic clock started switching the times again, so we ended up returning the clock for good yesterday."
2,Not the quality I thought it would be,"I anxiously received the Sound Spa Clock radio and was disappointed in the quality of the product. After the second night of using the clock, the Atomic clock swithed from Central time to Eastern time and my alarm went off an hour early."
2,Random time changing and difficult tuning,I bought this for my daughter because I loved the features and the look of it. Ours has the same problem with the time changing randomly. Quite annoying. It is also very difficult to tune the radio. Her older alarm clock did a much better job finding stations.We do love the nature sounds though.
3,Wimpy paper if wet,"The concept for an up to date chart is great. However, if any liquid spills on the chart (due to the type of paper used for the printing process) it will tear very easily. It is a must to upgrade to the protected (laminated) chart paper if you're going to use this type of chart on board."
2,One of the Weaker NG Episodes,"I would recommend this episode only if you are a BIG fan of Troi or this is one of the only episodes you have yet to collect and you want the complete collection.It attempts to show how Troi reacts when she loses her biggest assest, her emphathic powers. To me, she reacts more like a spoiled brat than a Starfleet Officer. She soon turns in her resignation as she feels she can no longer do her job effectively. In the end, of course, she regains her powers.Besides making a marginal character look about as shallow as possible, the storyline that accompanies it is weak too. This makes my list of one of the five worst episodes of the best TV series in history"
4,Baby Dustbuster,"This is a cute little kiddie version of my dustbuster that my 18 month old son is obsessed with. He likes to imitate what I do, so this is just perfect for him. It is a very cute, colorful and inexpensive toy that fits the bill for a toddler."
5,Fianally Conneted!!,"Spectrum Connections, Connecting Body Movement is absolutely my boys' favorite DVD to date! Elizabeth Balzano, a Music Therapist, sings fun, light hearted songs that children on the spectrum of Autism will enjoy, and inspire. My boys sing the songs, even when the tape is not playing! The other in the series, entitles connection emotions, is also very good, very similar. The bonus material is helpful and encouraging for Mom and Dad, too!! I would say, if you have a little Autie at home, these are definately the DVD's for you!!"
2,OK for Beginners,"It is an improvement on the documentation that comes from Linksys, but I was disappointed. It could have had a few more pictures, and I was expecting detailed explanations on how to configure all features of a router. When I got to the VPN portion of the book, which I was particularly interested in, it said, ""See a consultant."" Needless to say, that wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. But if you're just getting started, it will probably help you."
1,Complete Waste of Time and Money,"I have never been more disappointed with a computer and networking book than this one. I learned absolutely nothing. This book is oriented towards the total novice. If you have any experience at all with computers then this book is not for you. The book assumes there are only two operating systems: Windows 98SE and Windows XP. Windows 2000 is mentioned a couple of times in passing. This book is oriented to those who believe that Windows 98SE and Windows XP are the only operating systems available. There was no discussion of Macintosh, no discussion of Linux, no discussion of UNIX. If I'd had an opportunity to skim this book before purchasing it I would have left it on the shelf. The text was highly repetitive. All of the information in this book *should* have been included for free with the Linksys documentation. As it was, all of the information in the book *is* available for free with the Windows help and LInksys documentation. I feel scammed."
1,This is a good book but may not be for you.,"This book was of no help to me. I have several computers on a wireless network with a wireless G router, all running Windows 2000 flawlessly. I need to add a couple more older computers with windows 98 on them and bought the cheaper wireless b cards for them. This book told me NOTHING on dealing with a windows 2000 operating system, and did not help in the least to fix my problems getting the other computers to work. If you have windows XP this is probably a good book, but then windows XPs interfaces are self explainatory anyway. In my opinion do not buy this book if you have windows 2000 or windows 98."
4,Good for Macular Degeneration but very fragile,"I have been using these Noir anti-glare glasses for over seven years. I am quite dependent on them daily. Although they are very effective, they are extremely fragile. I have had numerous pairs and the ear piece breaks off simply by dropping them or keeping them in my pocket."
3,occasinally ok,"With her high operatic ,but beautiful voice,Margot manages to do this cd fairly well.I for one do not like yodeling songs, nor opera, but with only a couple or three yodelers in here, this cd isn't bad, the non yodelings are quite good.I realize that Margot is a class A yodeler, and I believe that she has done a lot of songs in the past that she was not credited with on the tapes as her singing sounds very familiar with old tapes I have.The problem with a cd with a voice like hers is, to me, it gets a little boring after awhile, thus I stated it as occasionally ok to listen to, but not repeatedly."
5,Rodriguez Sings,"This collection of poems by Andres Rodriguez deserves your attention. He casts his spectrum of feeling like a net across the entire collection, guiding you with empathy and wit. The language is never short on surprises or delicacy. It is at once familiar and cosmic, set upon a background of Latin American life in the Midwest. Each piece of verse builds on what came before it, sharpening into an emotional scalpel that cuts to the bone. It is the work of passion, beauty, warmth, and sensitivity. Poetry is alive and well thanks to Rodriguez and poets like him."
3,a garden book doesn't live on text alone ...,"I've just received my copy of this book. I find the approach chosen by Judy Glattstein innovative and fascinating, the text competent and entertaining. I was, however, terribly dissappointed about the quality of the photos. The worst are those taken by the author - they are mostly unsharp -, but most of the other pictures are no better. It's a shame quality control has not worked any better at Timber Press. If you want to know what good garden photography is, turn to Ian Adams' The Art of Garden Photography, just published by - Timber Press!Herbert Frei, Zurich, Switzerland"
2,"WARNING, Danger imminent! Those with casual interest need not apply.","I played this game years ago because I was a fan of the comic books. It certainly did not stand the test of time. Only the most hardcore of Danger Girl fans should consider picking it up as it has little going for it. Clunky controls, barely passable graphics, and occasional adult humor do not a good game make.The cover artwork is great, though. J. Scott Campbell is an incredible artist."
1,"Frustrating, Plain Frustrating!","This entire game and gameplay is nearly worthless. The camera angles, control and character movement are all entirely awkward. Additionally, the game has only save points after you complete the level. Generally, that would be somewhat excusable as in Eidos' Fear Effect for its difficulty, but this game isn't even difficult per se: just that your characters are very clumsy and move like tanks. There are few things in this game that actually bring the game from receiving a negative (as in below 1 star and below 0 star rating). First, the cover art is absolutely spectacular and the art inside is absolutely great. Second, the soundtrack within the game is excellent. Lastly, the inclusion of the Danger Girls is great! However, do not buy this game for the gameplay! You will be disappointed and annoyed. Just buy it for the game manual for the art on top and within, and the beautiful CD design!"
2,Poor woman's Syphon Filter/Tomb Raider,"Another example of a great idea that was poorly executed. Plays like a cheapened version of Syphon Filter or Tomb Raider. Like Tomorrow Never Dies, the wrong people got the rights to publish this title. Poor play control, medicore graphics, and insanely difficult mission goals. At least I only paid $30 for it :)"
5,The birth of a Country diva.,"1993 marked the debut of Faith Hill - who is now a singing sensation, and has undeniable talent. I remember first tuning into CMT and I saw this beautiful woman singing ""Piece Of My Heart"" - this music video led me to discover Faith Hill and her amazing talents - I quickly rushed out of the house and bought the [Take Me Ask I Am] CD.""Wild One"" - Faith's first song released became an instant #1 hit, then followed by ""Piece Of My Heart"" which also hit #1, then followed by the title track ""Take Me As I Am"" which became a loved top ten hit. Faith makes a great debut, and I'm happy to have listened to her music for 10 years now."
3,Debut,"1993 was the year Faith Hill released this album, her debut album titled Take Me As I Am. When Wild One was released it flew to the top of the charts, and Faith Hill became the hottest thing around. This is my least favorite Faith Hill album, I think her other albums have more substance and good material, but not to say this is all bad. The hit singles are great, and the album was marketed wisely. Nearly all the songs released became hits. After Wild One came other hits such as Take Me As I Am, Piece of My Heart, and But I Will. The highlight of the album is her take on the Janis Joplin hit Piece of My Heart, and I Would Be Stonger Than That is another honorable mention. This is a nice intro into Faith's music, but I would suggest It Matters To Me, excellent album."
4,A very good album,"This is Faith Hill before she went 'cross-over'. It's from 1993 and I think it was her first album. The songs are great and her cover of 'Piece of my Heart' is wonderful. If you want to hear what Faith sounded like before she went pop, then get this album. Recommended!"
4,Good Debut Album,"On TAKE ME AS I AM, the strawberry-maned, country-thrush exhibits a warm, satin voice, deceptively strong, with a slight, fragile quiver reminiscent of Dolly Parton. She has a liquid, vocal strength similar to that of her idol, Reba McEntire, but devoid of Reba's overwrought vocal gymnastics. From the defiant, teenage-rebel anthem ""Wild One"" to her brave, countrified remake of Janis Joplin's signature rocker ""Piece Of My Heart,"" Hill stakes out the wide territorybetween traditional and contemporary country, most notably in the classic-sounding ""But I Will."" In this impeccably produced (by boyfriend Scott Hendricks) album, Faith doesn't shy away from important topics. In ""I Would Be Stronger Than That,"" she tackles domestic violence. Unlike the aggressive tact of Martina McBride's ""Independence Day,"" Faith takes a more reflective stance. With her striking looks, full-bodied vocals, and strong material, TAKE ME AS I AM, poises Faith Hill as the next queen of country music."
3,cool album but not her best,"This is quite a good album and any serious Faith Hill fan will want to have it in their collection. However, it is not one of her best."
4,The Debut That Started It Off For Faith!,"Faith Hill started out more traditional country with her first 2 albums before crossing over to Pop/Country territory,which was a shame as this and her second album are her best work!This album includes her classic hits Take Me As I Am,Wild One and Piece Of My Heart.All excellent,catchy uptempos.Other gems include the duet with Larry Stewart I've Got This Friend and the lovely ballads Just About Now,Just Around The Eyes and I Would Be Stronger Than That(great lyrics to this song)Produced by Scott Hendricks- her now ex boyfriend,since she went on to marry Tim McGraw.It's a great collection of traditional 90's country music,that I'm sure anyone will enjoy...."
5,Good Start,"A fun album that defined her career. I love the title track as well as ""Wild One"" ""Piece of My Heart"" and ""Just Around the Eyes."" Not her best, but a great album for country fans."
4,OKEY DOKEY AND FINE TOO!,"This is early Faith Hill before the Nashville money machine got her I presume. Fine voice, good material, and great presentation. Would love to meet her. (Her ""Star Spangled Banner"" at some Super Bowl or the like was second only to Ray Charles' rendition. Could make you cry.)Ed W."
1,Awful,"I haven't yet recieved my cd i ordered on April 5 , they said it probably got lost in the mail, will probably never order from them again,because with somebody else i got the same cd two weeks before they said i would get it."
2,Important questions but misleading answers,"It is important to attend to the cultural context of the writings of the NT in order to understand them, and Malina and Neyrey are quite right to question the ethnocentric and anachronistic assumptions of much NT scholarship. However, this attempt to avoid these problems is doctrinaire, and based on some highly questionable generalisations about 'the ancients' (sic). For all of the promise of the book, there is little of substance here that would pass close scrutiny."
1,Cities of the World series are CRAP!,"Venice is the second of this series that I have seen (the other being Santorini), both leaving me very unimpressed and I could not wait for this particular DVD to finish. While this DVD covers most of the main attractions of Venice, the videography is second rate and does not instil any excitement or romance that is otherwise associated with a visit to Venice. The commentary is monotonal, too fast, snd at times random images not relevant to the topic being discussed are viewed.If you are looking for a DVD on Venice I would recommend Miraculous Canals of Venice. It was much more informative and interesting."
2,Too Much Preaching and Not Enough Facts From the Author,"The book was an unbalanced read. The section about how Bobby Williams got the job was very interesting. However, the part of the book after Williams was fired was spinned. There is more to keeping a college head coaching job than wins and losses, and Williams had a losing record his last year. At no point were attendance or donations mentioned, which is key to a head coach's popularity. If he had interviewed the president and the athletic director and had more information about their perception of the job Williams had done, the book would have had more credibility. When there are firings, they are not always right. However, as in the case of Williams, there were incidents that triggered it. The book would have been better if it had fewer pages and focus more on Williams."
3,Just the basics,"This is a good guide for those family & friends that have no idea, what your beliefs are or about. I let my mother read this and it helped clear up alot of misunderstandings for her. I had thought about Letting her read the book by Scott Cunningham. But the chapters on skyclad & sexuality would be to much for her, and this one left those subjects out."
5,Works Great for my 12 year old Beagle,"My beagle is 12 years old and has suffered with arthritis. She was on Previcox and Denosyl to protect her liver from the Previcox.. Since I have been using ArthriMaxx, she has not had any Previcox and is getting around well. I was really surprised. Before she walked slowly, now her tail is up, wagging and she gets around really well. As long as this keeps up, I will keep using Arthrimaxx. I can recommend this product for dogs who suffer from arthritis."
3,dont work for my ddog,"The vet prescribe this to my dog. Which of cause, I fould it better price over here. tried two bottle and I still havent seen any better so I switched it. Prob, my dog is old and severe arthitis. But I like it in liquid form, alot much easier."
5,Brushed Nickel Contact Paper,I used this contact paper on my shelves in my kitchen. It was very easy to put up and matches really well with the rest of my stainless steel appliances in my kitchen. The brushed nickel made it really easy to give my cabinets a remodel without much money.When I first started to put up the contact paper it didn't seem to have much of a stick to it and I was a little worried that it wouldn't hold but once it was on it seemed to adhear to the cabinet really well and I have not had any problems with it.
3,Above-average civil war diary,"If you've gone this far, you must have an above average interest in the Civil War and, to you, I'd recommend this book. Stearns was a bootmaker from outside Boston who managed to be in just about every important battle in the Eastern theater from 2nd Bull Run until he musters out during the Siege of Petersburg. After reading Last Full Measure and other 3rd person accounts of the war, it is interesting to read an account from someone who was there. I found it interesting that Stearns barely references the Battle of the Crater at Petersburg when I would have thought it was a major event for anyone who was there. Otherwise, a fairly quick and interesting read."
4,The Clique Novels,"The Clique Novels are really great! Massie, Claire, Dylan, and Kristin you'll get to know and love all of them. If you like stories about popular (sometimes backstabbing) rich girls, cute boys and crushes this book is for you. Might I add the ending of The Pretty Comitee Strikes Back is ahmazing can't wait to find out what happens next!!!!!!"
1,absolutely pathetic,"With the release of Gossip Girl came the releases of several, colorless 'spinoff' type series (i.e The A-List, The Au Pairs, so on). And this is absolutely the WORST. The characters are disgusting to read, and Claire is so unbelievably annoying it makes me want to rip my hair out in frustration. Not to mention the plot is so one-sided it can barely stand on its own two feet. Fans of ""Mean Girls"" supposedly flock to this book, when they really shouldn't -- this is stupid, dumb, and absolutely pointless. Save your money on something actually worth it.~ EricaSeventeen.com's Book Corner"
3,humm...... i don't know,"THis book was the last book of the Clique series and it kind of left you hanging. Ok, so the new girl Claira lyons (i total geek) wants to become friends with the 4 girls Massie block (the leader), Alicia, Kristin, and Dylin. Claire can'ot afford a house so she stays at Massie's. The 4 girls (excluding Claire) are the rich brats waring prada, luis vuiton... and cell phones. basically not realistic for 7th graders. The book kindof gives u the hint that claire is IN but it doesn't reely tell u for sure. i dont recomend it"
5,Yet to finish it,"I'm actually reading this book now, but I'm definitely getting sick of Massie's self-centeredness. I wish Claire could just show Massie how annoying and mean she is. I love this book, and this series, but Massie is such a brat!!!! If I was Claire, I would just show Massie that she's such a worthless crappy rich stuck up bitch. Hah!"
4,A Very Good Book!,"It was a good story! I plan to read the whole series! As a young teen, I'm really glad my Mom instilled in me the love of reading!"
4,I love the Clique!,I love these books because there is always constant drama. this particular book is amazing with all the plot twists. Cant wait to read the next one! PC forever!
5,"good,great, or WONDERFUL.",this book was wonderful and so are all the other books that go along with this.
5,"The Clique is Back, The Plot is thickening","The Pretty Committee is back, in this great sequel to the already awesome novel, ""The Clique"".In this book, the plot takes a wild turn when Massie decieds to beat two girls to having a boy/girl Halloween party. She gets caught up in the spirit, when she and the rest of the Pretty Committee where their hot, new Halloween costumes to school, and get detention.They then have the Halloween party, but one of the girls is not permitted to attend, because of the detention. The party is also not all it's cracked up to be, because Massie finds out her crush likes someone else.Then, the worst happens. Something that might actually tear Massie and Alicia apart...This sequel shows that a great story can keep going on. I highly reccommend this romantic, true, and funny book."
5,Fantastic Book!,This book was truely one of my all time favorite books because it related to my school and neighborhood. It really opened my eyes and made me think about my life in a different perspective than I usualy do. I highly recomend this book to middle or high school students around the ages os 11 - 16. I hope many people read this book!
5,#3,I am obsesed with the clique books.My fave part is the fasion show.As usal massie makes clairs life a living hell but in the end well u'll find out.Alicha meets olvia.And massie hates olvia.Massy is throing the first boy girl party to keep up her popularty.Dylan and Kysten are fighting over a guy.Alicha gets a new firend and cheats to beet massy.anyway eventhough I give this book a geat rading its not my fave.But u need to read them all to have a fave.PS. this is my 3ed fave
3,why the rich girls???,"m yeah okay, so like, why are rich girls always portraied as rich, selfish, snobs??? Ok, I happen to be rich and I'm totally NOT a snob!!! I have hundreds of friends and we're not mean to other girls like that and exclude them! I get whatever I want and I DON'T have any reason to hate other girls! We're all practickally friends, so yeah!! Mean girls was a better movie than this dumb book because at least Grechen and the dumb blonde were rich, but they were nicer. And you saw how Caddie (Lizzy Lohan) acted!!! So we rich girls should totally not be put down like that! Let's make some POOR girls snobs for once! Geez! What, just because they're poor and have no money or friends means they can't be self asorbed and creul??? Whatever... bye! You know you love me:"
4,The Clique,"I thought the clique books were kinda stupid, and not that realistic, but still fun to read. I live in Westchester, and kids aren't like that. It seemed kind of strange that Claire wasn't upper class, yet she still goes to the prestigious private school with Massie. Who pays her tuition? Massie's family? And even though most people here are rich, they don't give their seventh graders cells or drivers. Also, if Kristin's so poor, where does she get the money for all the designer goods? Even so, it was a fun book to read, especially since it was about where I live. :)"
4,best friend for never,"I enjoyed this book alot. It was predictable, how ever, which i was not to fond of because i like books that have an unexpected surprise. I really liked the fashion show at the end. i can't wait until the next book so i can see what happens! the ending is definately a cliff hangar, which makes some people really impatient because they want to know what happens next. overall, i really enjoyed this book!"
3,back in action,"The Clique is back, and snobbier than ever. After Claire and Massie began to (sort of) get along, they still haven't decided whether she is in or out. Massie is also having to deal with some ""wannabes"" who are doubting her power. To show them how wrong they are, Massie decides to throw the first ever ODC boy/girl Halloween party. The only problem is that she has to co-host with Claire. The Clique begins unraveling as Alicia finds a new friend and begins to backstab Massie, and Kristen and Dylan fight over a boy. Claire and Massie also like the same boy, but they don't know it. To top it all of, all the girls are competing against each other to design the first ODC uniform. Will the Clique survive all the cattiness?"
4,The Fashion Queen- Massie Block,"I really loved this book when i read it after the first one. Massie Block is a fashion queen inviting trouble every now and then. I wish i could have Massie's sense of fashion, but definitely not her sense of friends. Massie is horribly rude to Claire in the first book and things are better in the second book. I had a question for the author though (actually a few): What kind of job do Massie's parents have? ($350 for a skirt!) Where did Massie learn her sense of style?I really yearn for Massie's style (and money) and i hope anyone who reads this book enjoys it as much as i did."
5,Rich girls are still snobs,This book is great!I think it's way better thatn the first one.A whole lot more happens to the girls in this book than in the first.You can still realte to the girls in thisbook. When I read this book it felt like I could relate to all of them besides Claire and Massie. I really would recommend foreveryone toread this wonderful book.I like this book because it reminds me so much of my school.I don't think ther is any reason why I didn't like it. The author for this book is a total genius!She is very talented because at the first page she can hook you into the book is so great to read. I just can't wait for the third one. I bet it would be better than the first two I had read out of her series The Clique.Ouof it all I would recommend this if you like books that are comming of age novels.
4,Great Wine Safe,"This requires a strong person to put together, but it is sturdy and handsome and both keeps wine at the proper angle and locks it safely away."
1,"WARNING: This is a series of .mov files, NOT a true DVD - will not play on MAC",Don't expect to pop this in and autoplay. It's not a true DVD with chapters. It's a series of Quicktime files. The sound does not work on a MAC BOOK with the latest version of quicktime and leopard installed. For this price - I expect a lot more.
2,"Product is probably FINE, but pay attention to what you are getting for your money","I had just picked up 3 sets (4-piece settings) of these EXACT same Correll dishes at a local retailer. The sets included a dinner plate, a cereal/soup bowl, a bread and butter plate, and a coffee cup. Each set cost $26 and some change, and I was very pleased with what I got for my money. That being said, I wanted some luncheon/salad plates to go with them so I checked Amazon. They were available for what I THOUGHT was $13 and change for 4 of these smaller plates...which seemed reasonable, given the comparable cost of the 4 place, 16 piece setting. Imagine my surprise when for my $40 I recieved 3 plates in the mail! At that rate, it would cost me $150 or so to fill out my place settings LOL No thanks!!...they are going back...Just pay close attention: you are only getting ONE plate..."
5,Excellent!,"I heard this album on my friend's system and got instantly mesmerized. It conveys a plethora of moods, backed with live instruments excellently intermingled with electronica and occasional, good voices. The overall mood is a bit dark, but the bright moments make the melodies fantastic. A must have for chillout, trip hop and downtempo aficionados familiar with good European music of the genre."
3,Not My Greatest Expectations,"I received this book and i must say i was rather disappointedin it.I love doing dot-to-dot but i was expecting a much biggerbook than the actual size of it.I wish it could have been alot harder than what it was,as i did not find it that difficultat all.I found this item did not take much time for me to finishdoing all the dot-to-dots at all.Next time i would like to havea much bigger dot-to-dot book.Also maybe alot harder."
2,"Definitely not ""The GREATEST""","I was expecting so much more from this book with a title like ""The Greatest Dot to Dot Book in the World"". I bought this with the expectation that it would be a challenge for adults as well as children, but it truly is only a good book for beginners. I have it 2 stars instead of 1 however because the small variety of different puzzles was interesting. If the creator of the books could make more complicated puzzles with those same concepts I would be interested in trying his books again. If you are looking for a dot to dot book for children this is a good book to buy, but if you are looking for a dot to dot for adults, I would stick with the Mindware Extreme Dot to Dot books."
1,What is advertised is not received 3x,What is advertised is not received 3x. Complex puzzles are shown but 3rd grader puzzles are received.The same book was sent over and over?? I am not sure why this keeps happening.
1,Great challenges,"My three boys ages 11, 9 and 7 enjoy this dot to dot book immensley. They like puzzles and game books but have always found dot to dot unchallenging as they can tell what the picture will be before they attempt it. They have had fun doing these dot to dots cause they are always surprised at the detailed outcome.Yikes! I meant to rate this book with FIVE STARS. (oops!)"
1,Paid To Much,"The Dot-To-Dot Book purchased was over $10.00 including S & H. The book received was used, dog eared and eight of the puzzles were already completed by someone. Similar books can be purchased retail for a couple of dollars."
5,Great Stress Reliever,These dot to dot books are the best. Nothing like the ones that we grew up with. They are very addicting! Great stress reliever!
4,Gift to Carla,"Dot-to-Dot books Vol. 1-2-3 were given as a Christmas Gift. I was just told this morning that she (and she's 60 yrs old) loves them. So much so that she unstapled the books and made copies of them so she wouldn't mess up the ""good books"". She said I could have a page or two if I'd like to try them too! I'm considering it! Thank you for having such an item and making it easy to acquire. Sincerely, Ms. Melanie Donovan, North Weymouth, MA"
5,Dot-to-Dot,This book takes the classic to a higher and more interesting level. My six year old loves how the images take shape without him being able to tell what the picture is before completing the dots. FYI: Be sure to use a wide tip marker for best results.
4,My daughter loves it!,I bought this book for my 10 year old daughter and she really likes it. Right now she is into mazes and dot-to-dots and she is enjoying this book.
4,A Great Gift Idea!,"This was purchased as a gift for an older woman who is limited, physically. However, her mind is SHARP, and she was pleasantly surprised at the intricacy of the designs - not your average ""dot-to-dot.""Note: I'm actually considering getting one for myself - based on her evaluation!"
4,"Nostalgic, but very cool","I hadn't done a dot to dot puzzle since I was a kid but got this book on a whim. I was pretty surprised! Some of the pictures are pretty intricate. On the other hand, a few are a little lame. But most are very cool. I've gone through all the ""Greatest Dot-To-Dot book(s) in the World and they're worth it no matter what your age. Good for everyone, either sex. Really enjoyed all of them."
1,Durable but doesn't magnify well,"Yes, it's durable and it's a good size for a kid. However, the quality of the magnifying part stinks. It distorts what it's supposed to magnify. It's a pretend magnifying glass for all intents and purposes."
3,children's magnifying glass,"I found the ""glass"" to be somewhat blurry and was disappointed in my purchase, but my 3-year old grandson loves it and asks to use it all the time. Has examined bugs, leaves and flowers in the yard as well as many parts of my dog!"
5,Great stain for Mexican Tiles,"Tiled our house with Saltillo Tiles but the color was too pink, the Spanish Oak Tile Stain (4 coats), gave it a rich dark brown finish, and gave it an entirely different look. Love this stain!!"
5,This is probably the best album I own,"I'm a David Lynch fan -- and that's, of course, how I got to know Julee Cruise.This is her second album -- and her best to date, in my opinion. Her style has changed, so I don't think she'll ever equal this gem's eeriness and tremendous beauty.The best songs on it are ""Up In Flames"" (those who have seen ""Wild At Heart"" will be familiar with the tune), ""Questions In A World Of Blue"" (as heard in ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me""), ""The Voice Of Love"", ""She Would Die For Love"", ""Until The End Of The World""... all of them, actually.David Lynch wrote the lyrics, Angelo Badalamenti wrote the music and arranged the songs. That's a team you just can't beat. The album is magnificent, Cruise's voice fits the melodies perfectly.This is (dream) pop at its best."
5,Impossible to define - impossible to forget,"First let me give a heartfelt shout out to all of the kindred spirits out there who wrote such glowing reviews for this album. I've played Julie's music for so many people over the years who just didn't get it, I expected to find mixed ratings here and was very elated to find a ranking of 4 and a half stars, which I think is right on the money. Julie, you posess a beauty that time will never erase as it so utterly transcends physicality. Your voice has lulled me to sleep countless nights into dreams as surreal as the movies of David Lynch himself. I must give equal credit to Mr. lynch for his lyrical genius and to the Bad Angel who'se eerily beautiful droning melodies shall forever haunt my imagination."
5,Yes!,"i like this camera very much. It shoots excellent photos, is loaded with handy features and has outstanding battery life. it took me several months to take the leap into digital imaging and am glad i chose the 2020w. it was worth it. my only suggestion is to buy a larger smart media card immediately. the 4-meg card it comes with is way too small. get the 64-meg card & shoot away!"
4,Great camera - poor support,"After reading all the reviews, I bought the Olympus 2020 Zoom. The camera itself has lived up to expectations - easy to use with terrific features. Unfortunately, Olympus customer support isn't there. After one week I started having trouble connecting the camera to my computer. I've sent two messages to the Olympus customer online support. Though it promises 72 hours response time, I haven't had a response in over a week to either message. Support does matter. I can't get the photos out of my camera!"
3,cherished teddies,"this book was not as informative as i thought it may be. I have an older book by a different author, and it gives a higher value and any rarities or varations that a teddie may have.. It's an OK book but i would have liked more info.."
5,B-12 Chemotool,"I was at a gas station looking for a fuel injector/gas cleaner. The man working there, told me to go to Wal-Mart and purchase this product. He said it was the best, better than what his store sold. I purchased it. WOW was I floored at the increase of my gas mileage! I normally get 375 miles to a tank (21 gal) when I put this in I had loaded cargo, my mileage went to 460!My next tank was 440ish (I wasn't on Empty)It's a MUST have to any vehicle maintenance.It is inexpensive, around $3.00 a can."
5,"If I could give 6 stars, I would","My daughter is six and is frustrated that as she gets older the books have less pictures and are not as fun to read (her own words). She hasn't put this book set down yet. She has one that she's reading and walks around with the other two all day long. It's a beginnger chapter book so not difficult to read, pictures are peppered throughout and she likes that and most of all, the books are funny. She reads and laughs throughout the day - totally engaged. I'm so happy I found a book series that she likes better than watching TV.Now I have to find something similar for my 8 year old..."
5,Daughter loved it!,Bought it for my daughter and she loved it! She found it entertaining and it's a good reading material for advanced 1st graders.
4,"A nice, but not perfect pack of books","I rate this a four star because they are very good books but I had read them all very very soon. I wish that this had contained: more books, bigger books, or both. But other than that this book pack is great!"
5,The Ancient Legacy,"Took a little longer to get here than it should have, but everyone was helpful and curteous. Book is in GREAT comdition and I am happy.The Ancient Legacy"
3,just not as good,"although the first two books to the trilogy really told a great story through the whole book. this book just didnt really have it, through the first 300 or so pages all he says is how this ""war"" is going to happen. At the end though it was pretty decent due to some battle scenes. the other 2 books are amazing i loved em!"
4,Great Book! The Authority Done RIGHT!,"If you're a fan of the Authority or into Supers RPGs then how can you NOT buy this book? This is one thick book. In it are write ups of all the main and supporting characters from the Authority comic by DC along with a time line and overview of the comic series.The book uses a varient of the Tri Stat system using 12 sided dice instead of the 10 sided dice used in the Silver Age Sentinals book or the six sided dice used in Big Eyes Small Mouth.This book is ALL you really need to GM/ Play in an Authority game. It would help if you have read some of the comics, but is not necessary. The book lists all the powers, skills, etc to make up a character for play. The art in the book is taken from the comic and is very fine. GOO does a fine job in the art/ layout of the books they publish and it certainly shows here.I am looking forward to the follow up Stormwatch book."
4,Uncle Brian Rok more than smelly sox??,"Uncle Brian are such a cool ska band! They really are great and im not just bein biast! (maybe its just coz i love all happy ska/punk!!) The best songs on the album are 'jelly head' and 'better off gay'. This band arent just good on this cd, their ace live aswell! (ive seen em twice!) Expect 2 hear well more from them soon! BYE THIS CD! (ps, its well worth the monies!! :D"
2,Dull dull dull,Slow yet professionally produced. Have seen other works that create more interest in drama about this fascinating subject
3,Mixed blessing,"I'm a lifelong Tar Heel fan, so I'm delighted that I can get this Championship Game on DVD.Only problem is, the game wasn't terribly exciting. I was excited that UNC won the game somewhat easily, but it wasn't a very thrilling game to watch.Buy it if you are a huge Tar Heel fan (or a fan of any game Michigan State loses), but for others it may not be such a worthy purchase. Since you already know the outcome, the game itself has to be exciting in order to enjoy it on repeated viewings. This one wasn't."
3,Most of these are NOT the originals,"This set offers many of his finest songs but if you want your truest memories restored this won't do it for you. These are re-makes and newly edited versions in many if not most cases, and it just ain't the same that way."
5,All the greats and forgottens of Paul Simon.,"Paul Simon spans generations and ethnic boundaries with his soul striking hits. Songs on these albums culminate his questions and answers regarding politics, spirituality, love, and being. Many Paul Simon songs you think you don't know and suddenly you realize you know the words. This is a must have collection. A set to please your every mood."
5,AWESOME! BUY IT!,Paul Simon is the king of music. A must have. Contains one song (Thelma) that is unreleased (to the best of my knowledge) plus all of his greatest.
4,Been waiting for this,"This style of game isn't for everyone, but it's something that I've been wanting for ages. Not just on the gameboy, but on any system. I love american style RPGS. First of all it's 3D and it's not slow - WOW. Towers has A very integrated storyline, plenty of monster bashing, and tough but not stupid puzzles. I still can't believe this is on the Gameboy. Probably one of the best features is the two-player game using the link cable. I had to try it out, so I picked up an extra copy. My boy and I have been playing ever since. In one siting, we played until my batteries ran out, around 4 hours. My only real complaint is the spell system, not that intuitive. Once you get used to it though, it's not that bad.If RPGs is your game, I can't recommend Towers enough."
4,The Best of the Best of Steamshovel Press,A compilation of the best articles from the seminal conspiracy magazine Steamshovel Press.This one definitely gets a positive plug from this reviewer as one of my own stories is featured in the book (Project Mind Kontrol: Did the U.S. Government Actually Create Programmed Assassins?).Enjoy!
4,"Good Album, But Doesn't Quite Meet My Lofty Expectations","I discovered Son Volt and Wilco in the last year or so and really love both of them. My appreciation for the two spinoff groups led me to Uncle Tupelo, and everything I read said Anodyne was THE Uncle Tupelo album -- so I was excited to get it.Anodyne is a really solid album; it's very easy to listen to the whole thing and there are no bad songs. But it didn't quite match up to the high (probably unreasonable) expectations I had for it. The album is a little more country-ish/less alt-ish than I had hoped and I don't find it quite as interesting as some of the Wilco/Son Volt albums.But I'm clearly biased by my perspective. I came to this album backwards and I'm not a huge country fan. Still, I recommend Anodyne for anyone who loves their alt country with a little more country. And I think it's the type of album that will really grow on listerners after a paying it a half-dozen or so times."
5,one of the greatest of alltime,Uncle Tupelo combines two of the best vocals in Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy. This album is a perfect mix of some more mellow rock combined with a little of the faster paced stuff that Uncle Tupelo usually brings you.
4,The finale of their progression as a band,"I have all of their albums and have seen this band play live in Columbia, Mo form their beginning to their end. I love this album and it is a must to have but it's a departure form their early stuff. Gone are the grungy Gibson SG-through a Marshall Stack- power chords. Present are the representations of of the group's true love which is old American country and folk music. They perform these tracks with great expertise and the help of really good studio mixers doesn;t hurt either. If you are a fan of UT then this is a must have. Just don't expect the raw energy of their ""country punk"" from their first two albums."
3,Moments of greatness,Anodyne gives a true taste of what could have been. UT had the makings to be one of the great country rock bands ever. Unfortunately neither Tweedy or Farrar can stay with the format that shakes us to our inner souls. They must branch towards other (electric) feels throughout all their works. This one could have been one of the best if they let it stay sweet.
1,got to be kidding,"I read one user review of this that said "" Give me back the keys to my heart"" was a good song with good lyrics. HAH! I could throw scrabble tiles on the floor and come up with something better. If you really love Wilco (like I do) there are a few good Tweedy gems buried in this garbage but I would recommend buying downloads of Acuff-Rose etc. Dont waste your money on this cd!"
4,"An interesting read, especially if you love traveling","While the book did read much like a travel diary at points, it was very insightfull and introspective. It really gave me the feel of extended traveling around South America."
2,Hay mejores discos de El Tri,"No me gusto. No hay nada nuevo y los comentarios homofobicos e ignorantes de Alex Lora abundan. Desafortunadamente la banda esta pasando por una fase de una severa falta de creatividad.Que hay de nuevo en este disco que no haya en los previos discos en vivo de la banda, me pregunto yo?"
4,Great book!,"Charlotte Brailey Kneeland is a past president of the International Side-Saddle Organization, and Jan Floyd, the illustrator, is equally well known in the field. Kneeland's text is very clear and informative and covers, exactly as the title promises, almost all aspects of English sidesaddle riding for beginners. Floyd's illustrations are much clearer than photographs could be because she can show - in very close detail - fine but important points a camera would blend together or simply miss. For more experienced riders, this is a good refresher book, and should be recommended reading for all those just starting to ride aside. My one wish is that this book covered mounting!"
5,Very good!,"This was a very good book! The drawings are clear and well done. I agree, this book could have been longer. It is a very good basic intro into sidesaddle riding."
3,Terrified my toddler,"I've tried to play this video twice- each time my toddler has started crying with fear after only a few seconds of video and required lots of solace to calm down. Apparently the hand puppet used in the video terrifies her. I know its strange and Freud would probably have a field day with this. We haven't been able to watch the whole thing. It may be good, who knows."
2,You Can Do Better.,"This video is disappointing. Offering only 10 signs, anadorable girl of about 3 or 4 signs each of (only) 10 signs. After she quickly and imprecisely shows the sign several times, a puppet takes over and performs a slow, little skit that demonstrates the object of the sign in some way. He puts a ball through a hoop for the word ""ball,"" for instance. The actions of the puppet do not reinforce the sign, which isn't repeated, and only distracts the viewer from the sign the action illustrates. In one case of extreme sign confusion, an adult giving a baby a bottle of juice to demonstrate ""milk!""This video borrows heavily from the Baby Einstein videos, which are designed to introduce children to art and music. If you're looking for a video for your toddler, I'd suggest sticking with the original Baby Einstein. If you want to learn sign language with your child, get Baby See 'n Sign."
2,Entertains but does not do much for teaching signs!,"I was VERY disappointed! This viedo shows poor versions of only a FEW signs, and while they SHOW and SAY the word, they only sign it once or twice, and poorly done. They verbally repeat the word many times, but fail to SHOW the sign as often! They waste a LOT of time showing kids (the producer's ?)doing things, with nothing but music with it.I would much prefer to reccomend ""Talking Hands"" or Joseph Garcia's kit ""Sign with your Baby"", or ""Sign Me a Story"", or even ""Baby See and Sign"" (not the best, though).While my 22 mo. daughter loved it, it was NOT doing much to teach her to SIGN, which is why I bought it. Save your money!"
2,"ENTERTAINING, LITTLE SUBSTANCE","Cute video. Only 10 signs. I see it as a good ""first exposure"" video to interest the youngest of children in signing. I did find it hard to tell exactly what the child in it is trying to sign? I'd call this one ""entertainment"", with little substance."
5,Awesome video!,"This tape is just incredible! I bought it for my son when he was first born, and began playing it for him around 3 months old. Even then, he just loved the music, and especially the star of the video, Sunny Bunny. He is now 14 months old, and it is his very favorite! He does not watch much TV or videos, in fact he won't even watch Barney or Sesame St. yet...but this video gets him all excited. In fact, he knows what the cover looks like, and tries to put it into the VCR all by himself! He dances and belly laughs through the whole tape, and he has picked up some of the signs too, and uses them regularly. We just love it! In fact, I'm here to buy another copy, because this one is getting worn out, and I don't want to be without it!"
2,"A great idea, but cheap production. Rather disappointing","I think signing with your infant is a great idea, but this tape didn't teach many signs and it isn't very well made. I think some of the other tapes out there are better."
4,The kids love it,"My wife and I are very pleased with our purchase and have recommended the video to other friends and famiy members. The kids love watching, dancing and signing."
2,OK,"Cute but way too short. Also,the kids in the video only do the sign twice for each word. The rest is a bunch of puppets. The kids like it,but there needs to be more repitition of the signing for kids to learn effectively."
4,Signing for Babies...,"My twin boys love this video! They will watch the video and sometimes try to sign along with the babies on the screen. The format is very engaging for my boys, who are not normally all that interested in watching television. My only suggestion would be to include the signs for some of the things that are shown on the video, such as the fish at the end of the tape. Otherwise, it has definately helped my two with beginning signs!"
2,not the best choice,This video has only a few signs imperfectly signed by a toddler. The visuals do not clearly illustrate the sign which is only given twice. Better videos for the buck are _Talking Hands_ and _See n Sign_. Both have more signs clearly and better illustrated.
5,A great addition to the playmobile house or farm,"I bought this to go with my daughter's playmobile ""123"" house. She likes to play with these bunnies and sunflowers better than the house! All parts of this set come apart: the flowers from their stalk, the stalks from the dirt, the ribbons from the straw hats, the straw hats from the girls' heads... The bunnies are cute and come with little dishes for feeding and a little fenched in area. Also, the bunny cage is well made with little lattice doors that open and shut easily. Of course, the whole cage comes apart, too. THe set comes with two girls who have hands, arms and legs that move. The hands can also latch on to the fence pieces.I love ALL of the playmobile sets and can't wait to buy more. The only problem is how to store them so the little parts don't get lost. For now, it's a tupperware thing, but I'd love to see the company come up with some nicer storage options."
2,Difficult to manage,"For toys to be fun they have to be accessable to children to create ""play space."" This, like most Playmobil sets, has a lot of little pieces that tend to wander off. We've tried plastic containers to keep the pieces together -- but they always seem to get lost in the BIG toy box. Then when they do want to play, they can't find all of the pieces. Unlike some other Playmobil sets, this one lacks a place to put all of the little pieces together and put it up on the shelf. That said, the pieces are sturdy and the kids enjoy playing when they can find them."
5,a special place for me,"I read and enjoyed this book as a child. I most remember how absolutely special and thoughtful it was of Evan's mom to accept and appreciate his need for a ""place of his own."" My apartment was quite like Evan's, filled to brimming with relatives both noisy and nosy. How tender the feeling created in the reader as Evan uses his space, and comes to treasure both his own little world and that he shares with others.-kim o'connell"
2,Broke a D string after one month,"I doubt I had more than 15 hours total playing time on these strings before one of the D strings unwound a few millimeters from the bridge. I was barely strumming the strings with a light pick near the fret board when I heard a pop and saw the inner D string start to unwind. This is the first time I tried these strings and unfortunately the first one to ever break with so little cause. They play nice, but I don't know if I will get them again."
1,false advertising of litecubes,"Tray of Twenty Four (24) Litecubes Flashing LED Multi-Color Freezable Ice Cubes / RocksThe product I received was not Litecubes brand ""litecubes"" as advertised. The ""litecubes"" received are a lot smaller than Litecubes brand ""litecubes"". The product I received does not have 8 function light choice capabilities, as Litecubes brand ""litecubes"" do; it has one choice that flashes in all colors. The ""litecubes"" received also do not look the same as in the picture, with the Litecubes brand with the little ""R"" in the circle becaues they're fakes!"
2,Well...an earnest effort...,"I am frequently searching for therapeutic tools to use, as I have a developmentally disabled, non-verbal grandchild, and also work in the school district with young adult disabled students. Neither group would watch this DVD. I don't know if it was the music, the vocals or the video quality, but no one sat for more than five minutes, with the exception of an adult Downs Syndrome student, who turned the volume off and then just laughed, and also stopped watching after about 7 minutes. Maybe it is better for higher functioning autistic children."
5,3 yr old DD with autism LOVES this,"Amazing! My DD loved this DVD instantly. The singing is great but the best part is the facial expressions she started immitating instantly. We've never been able to get her to do more than happy or silly and she would meltdown if anyone tried to teach her sad or crying. With this she did every facial expression! She really connected with this DVD from the first second Balloo (cute, cute!) came on the screen.This is like Baby Bumblebee and Laurie Berkner from Jack's Music Show on Noggin combined into one and made especially for autism spectrum. GREAT FIND!!!"
5,Al Jarreau- A Living Legend,"Once again Al Jarreau proves himself to be one of the foremost voices in the music industry and THE consumate musician with his album and Live video TENDERNESS.This video is 60 minutes of pure artistry and musicianship comprised of the creme de la creme of the music industry supporting one of the greatest assets Jazz, R&B and Pop music has ever seen. Owners of the TENDERNESS CD will really appreciate the fact that most of the performances on the Video are of different takes than the ones that exist on the album; showcasing, in my opinion, one of the most amazing facets of Jarreau's performing: his ability to make the same song a completely different musical experience no matter how many times he has performed it.Al Jarreau will always be at the top of my list as one of the best vocalists of our time, and I guarantee the same for your list if you view this Video for yourself! Enjoy!"
3,"Tense, well-crafted melodrama","This film is a carefully crafted melodrama, with an intricate plot. Despite the presence of Sean Connery, the film avoids the action of the James Bond genre, and more closely resembles slower, deliberately-paced British spy movies like The Ipcress File, or Funeral in Berlin. The plot concerns hostage-taking and airline hijacking, while much of the drama lies in the issues facing security personnel in these difficult situations. The cinematography, which showcases snow-covered Scandinavian landscapes, is outstanding. The twist at the end is somewhat implausible, but on the whole this is a tense, taut movie that holds the viewer's attention."
4,One of Connery's lost films but a good thriller.,"I wish I would have waited till the DVD came out because I paid $29,99 for the VHS tape. But anyway, very good movie and Connery is at his best after the post 007 era. He is more of a classy verison of Dirty Harry where he breaks all of the rules to get the terrorist but does it with charm!"
4,CONNERY'S SECURITY,"In a pre-9/11 world, THE TERRORISTS addresses the fears we all have of being victimized by self-righteous, insensitive terrorists. Tame by today's standards, this little known vehicle for Sean Connery is an intelligently plotted and tense little thriller. Connery plays the no-nonsense head of Norway's Security, called in when a group of British terrorists invade the home of the British Ambassador and hold him hostage, demanding release of imprisoned compatriates and safe passage out of Norway. These plans go awry however when the British government discovers the drop point and the terrorists are forced to make a change in plans. This change is orchestrated by a fellow terrorist, played with subdued relish by DEADWOOD's Ian McShane, who holds a commercial airline and its passengers hostage until the other group is released.As in most British films of the seventies, the pace is deliberate but there is a good amount of suspense generated, and Connery is effective in his role."
3,Interesting until perverse ending,"I like this sort of film, which has extended bouts of dialog to create a genuine plot, along with a decent amount of action, just to keep it exciting. This film has that 60's British feel to it, although it was made in 1975 and set in Norway.(warning ending slightly revealed next) The only thing I thought was wrong with this film was a rather perverse ending. Connery was set up to be the ""fixer"" of problems others created, but in the end, it seemed like the plan was going well, but Connery bungled it, causing someone to get killed, all in the name of some ambiguous ""higher"" morality."
3,"The book is extremely detailed, but that's the problem.","If I was rating this merely on how much information you can cram into one book or audio program I'd give it 5 stars, but the problem is that it IS too detailed to the point that your mind is overwhelmed with time, names dates and events.A historical book is only half of what it could be if it doesn't flow easily. It's tragic that the editor didn't force the author to thin out his work somewhat."
3,unbiased and academically dry,"I purchased and read this book because I wanted an accurate scholarly survey of Sparta. I did not want another hollywood-inspired story that glossed over the bad in favor of glorifying the 300. For that, The Spartans is quite good. Unfortunately, Mr. Cartledge offers the level of writing one would expect in a post-graduate course on ancient Greece. At times, page after page is painfully dry as he focuses on who is descended from who and how far one particular city is from another. Clearly, he is an expert on the subject. For someone looking for a casual read, this may be just a bit too much. I am happy to have read the book and feel I learned a great deal, but I also felt like I was back in grad school. Certainly educational, but not quite an entertaining read. I only point this out because it is marketed as such."
4,Interesting.,"I have just finished reading ""Spartans"" and I must say that I enjoyed the book, it told me a lot about the Spartans that I did not know. The only problem that I had was that of being able to pronounce some of the names of the characters. As a amateur history nut I did learn a lot and I have a few other books by this author that I look forward to reading. If you do not know anything about the Greek history this book will start you on your way but you will need to just take your time and enjoy the book."
1,Probably not what you're expecting...,"If you're expecting a nice, concise introduction to the Spartans, you will be very disappointed with this book. As most reviewers have stated below, Cartledge is clearly an authority on the subject...it's his writing style that is at issue.It's a bad sign when a history nut (me), with a particular affinity for Mediterranean culture, is unable/unwilling to finish a book of this brevity. Maddeningly confusing, and, in my opinion, totally unreadable."
2,"High marks for expertise, low ones for writing ability","This book reads like a graduate student's thesis. While it is quite informative, it is anything but a pleasure to read. When compared with Keegan's recent work on the Pelopenesian war (as it was paired when I purchased it) this failing becomes even more apparent. Whereas Keegan's prose engrosses the reader and facilitates the digestion of uncountable greek names, Cartledge's prose is choppy, repetitive and serves to motivate the reader to put down his book and look for something more pleasant to read. The use of the distnict biographical vignettes made this an incredibly choppy read.While the book claimed to assess the role of the idea of Sparta throughout history and its impact on our modern day society, it focused entirely on ancient history. While interesting, it wasn't what was promised."
2,A Phalanx of Information,"Sometimes this book seemed as wide as Texas and just as dry. I love ancient Greek history, and in particular the peculiar culture of Sparta, but after so many pages I was just ready to fall on my sword from the boredom of pages interspersed with sporadic paragraphs of interest. Nothing shielded me from the weight of mind-numbing information that I desperately wanted to find interesting.Judging by all the five stars for this book, I can only conclude that I lack the intellectual depth for this, and I should cry in my helmet.For this book, I would do something a Spartan would never do--surrender."
1,Non-linear structure,"I had very little knowledge of Ancient Greece when I began reading this book. Unfortunately, I am still ignorant afterward. I gamely read through the introduction and two chapters of the book before realizing that I was retaining very little new information. The author throws names and dates around without providing a clear structure for understanding them. For example, he may mention three different people in two different centuries within one sentence, but he fails to explain who those people are or why he is writing about them. I finally decided that the book was wasting my time and put it down into the ""recycle"" pile.What I expected was a succinctly written primer on the history of the Spartan people. What I received was a jumble of names and dates that resembles nothing more than a rambling discourse. A clear story following the boring, but comprehensible, process of cause and effect would have made this much more valuable."
4,Just a reader,"Cartledge knows more about the Spartans than I do but that is probably because I graduated from the University of California. I bought the book through the history book club, built a fire, made some coffee and read it. Yes the style was annoying and it was a bit hard to follow for the non-historian like myself, but I know more about the subject than I did before I picked the book up. I wished that it had covered some more topics though and I was confused about the fox hunting chapter. I would have loved a better peek into the mess halls, male relationships, dual kingships, the navy that the rivalry with Athens forced on the Spartans, the battle dress, weaponry, black soup, and the relationship with the Thebes and a bit more on the Helots. But hey, look, I'm actually now this knowledgeable about the subject and for that I can thank Mr Cartledge. Whew....I never knew that greek historians got so worked up about this stuff. Maybe I should stick to Roman history ??"
2,CD Print Misnomer,"Bought it from the Amazon Marketplace.Whilst the CD sent over to me is printed as 'The Best of 12 Girls Band', the problem is that the contents (music) are incorrect.As opposed to the 16 songs that are supposed to be included, only 12 are, and a majority, if not all of them, are mis-titled.Jet Audio, iTunes, Windows Media Player and Exact Audio Copy were not able to receive feedback for the contents of the disc, which is also something fishy.At present, I am not sure if this is a batch print error or the problem is a secluded one, but if you know your titles from this band, I would suggest avoiding the purchase of this product until the issue gets (hopefully) ironed out."
1,Wrong CD in the Album,I bought this CD specifically for music #5 Kawa No Nagare No Yoni. Not on the disc. Returned for refund. No action until I talked to an agent in India to check and process a refund. I want to order another copy but am afraid to because of poor quality control by manufacturer.
4,12 girls band...,the music is nice and cool. especially as it is played with mostly traditional chinese musical instruments. i was really captivated by the video.
3,blue devil duck,"Again, Still a lot of money for some rubber ducks. they are cute and my friend loved them... I received this duck SUPER FAST!"
3,Gorgeous but painful :(,"I have had these shoes for more than a year and rarely wear them..mainly because I am a sneakers and jean type of girl. The three times I've worn them were for holiday parties and a wedding. During those times, I usually wore them for about 3-5 hours just walking around - no dancing. After about 15 minutes of wearing them and walking around, my feet are in pain. They lack support at the foot arch and at the ball of the foot. It doesn't help that they are extremely high too..at least for me. At it's highest point, the heel is about 4"". I still love them because they truly are sexy but hesitate to wear them. I might look into buying some insoles to help support my arch and cushion the ball of my foot and see how that goes. Other than those two things, I usually wear a size 7.5 and they fit me fine. The leather at the front is soft and doesn't dig into my skin. The ankle strap helps to keep my foot firmly in place."
4,Great shoes!,"I'm glad I bought these shoes because they were exactly what everyone else was wearing and the same brand HOWEVER, they are a little hard to walk in considering I needed a 7.5 instead of an 8 and if I were to buy a different pair I would get the ones with an ankle strap so that they were easier to walk in on stage."
3,"3.5 Stars, Informative and Concise Book",I have to admit that this book was kind of forced upon me because of a paper that had to be written for school. What a surprise as I read through this short but very informative text!Dr. Raboteau does a wonderful job of explaining the religious history of African American religious customs in America. One of the nice things about the book is the personal letters that are in between each chapter.This is a book that everyone should consider reading. You will walk away from it with a clearer understanding of the issues that were so prevalent not so very long ago. This also may pique your interest as far as studying this subject in greater depth.A great read that is quite informative for its small size. Dr. Raboteau is clearly a very learned man and does not waste words or space with his writing. You could read a book twice the size and only come away with slightly more information.
5,Fantastic Re-Master SACD,"The SACD remastered by MFSL is amazing. In fact, after receiving this disc I promptly went Into The Labyrinth where I'm still lost to this day. Luckily it has WiFi and I have a laptop with a body motion charger so I can still write reviews. Although it will be tough to give Amazon my address when ordering from now on. Of course I'm probably gonna die of starvation anyway. Bummer."
1,1 Word - Annoying!,"I have hidden this CD to make sure it never finds its way into my player. I totally appreciate this genre of music, but Dead Can Dance is horrible! The vocals alone make me wish I was deaf. You can do a lot better than getting this album."
3,"Some songs are really good, but..","but most songs are too oriental (even for Israeli ;-) or too 'dark' - prepare to get into a blue mood after this disc. ""How Fortunate the Man with None"" and ""Yulunga"" are, imho, the best songs on the disc, albeit they are quite different in style - one for the dark, one for the oriental trend. If you're expecting some Celtic influences here, there are almost none."
3,Not consistently good,"I enjoyed Aion, an earlier Dead Can Dance album, so I decided to try this one as well. Though I expected a stylistic change, I wasn't sure whether it would be for the better of the worse. It turned out to be mostly for the worse. On Aion, Brendan Perry was the lead singer on only one track. Here, he does four, and I don't like them. ""How Fortunate the Man With None"" is okay, but the rest sound almost like pop songs, which isn't what I wanted from this CD. The other songs are all sung by Lisa Gerrard, who is a much better singer, and there are a few really good ones, such as ""Emmeleia."" (Brendan Perry is also one many of these, but he doesn't have the same problems as a backup singer.) Unfortunately, many of them are too synth-heavy for my taste, and DCD isn't as convincing when playing this Middle Eastern-influenced music as they were playing European early music. I won't sell this CD, but it has discouraged me from buying any more Dead Can Dance albums."
3,Not quite up there,"Dead Can Dance just didn't grab me with this one, for some reason. There seems to be a certain unfocussed feel to the release that's not present on standouts like ""Aion"", ""Within the Realm..."", and ""Spiritchaser"". Perhaps it's the growing amount of Arabic and Asian sounds, with which Perry and Gerrard don't sound 100% comfortable as of this album. Perhaps it's just that it's not on par. Or perhaps they're trying to sell to that goth image, rather than concentrate on their own musical vision. As an example: ""How Fortunate the Man with None"" is very similar in direction to ""Fortune Presents Gifts not According to the Book"" from ""Aion"". But while that was a wonderful reading/arrangement of an old morality play song, this new track is just a plodding, darkish thing that goes on too long. Still, the musicianship saves this thing very well...I just wish the compositional craft here was up to the same level!"
4,i know what this is!,"this is world music, plain and simple and leaning towards ambient. and the fact that any of these songs received airplay--track 2, ""the ubiquitous mr. lovegrove"" was a minor hit of sorts--is entirely unbelievable. this album came to me hidden by a few dozen others in a gigantic selection i bought for a paltry sum on ebay. it is wonderful night-time music, darkened-room music, sex music, winter music, etc, etc. the whole thing is so subtly crafted, the percussion always just right, the arrangements never overdone, the vocals never too dramatic. it's a very well done piece of music/work of art, and if you're into this sort of thing, you can't go wrong."
2,The world's THAT miserable?,"As usual, DCD's unique style is heard throughout ""Into the Labrynth"", but on the whole, this one drones and moans more than usual and gets a bit monotanous. Brendan Perry's voice CAN get iritating after a while,( The guy seriously needs a Prozac regimine ) and ""How Fortunate the Man With None"" really tests the endurance of how long an individual can listen to sick beasts begging for merciful euthenasia.""The Carnival Is Over"" is a bit sweeter but... Sadly, the standout track for me was ""Emmeleia"", a far-too-brief but intrigueing duet from Perry and Gerrard. (To my recollection the ONLY piece where the two of them are heard simultaneously on the entire production. ) Not the best from the ""Dead""."
5,"Haunting, strong atmospheric melancholy","""Into the Labyrinth"" is one of my favorite Dead Can Dance albums. It could make a fine introduction to their music. It's haunting and melancholy. Perhaps a bit strong for simple background music, but I can imagine using it as part of one's soundtrack for a more downbeat Halloween party, as music to read horror novels to, or to have on while playing a tabletop or live-action horror role-playing game."

2,really bad directions,"it works fine... but the directions for use are horrible in that they are very confusing. as someone who has little experience with electronics (but wanted to use something i had purchased abroad) i would say that if you don't know what you're doing, don't rely on the directions."
1,way too heavy to haul to europe,"way to heavy to haul to europe and does not even help with US hair dryer or curling iron, we brought to Russia, and threw in the trash and left in Russia, what a pain it weights like 50lb., would not recommend, security even stopped us, not a good deal to bring."
4,"A good overview with layman's terms, easy to understand","As an attorney who considers himself pretty well versed in the content of this book, I read the book with an intent to review an area of the law I had not practiced in a while. The book was a pleasant surprise to me. The explanations given by Mr. Klueger were accurate and well written in terms anyone would understand, even an old salt lawyer like me. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the nuts & bolts of asset protection strategies, even before the reader goes to his lawyer to discuss his own concerns. The form for a family limited partnership in the back of the book is handy and good reading as an example. I only wish Mr. Klueger had included some additional forms for the various stratagies mentioned in the book. Overall, I'd give it a ""well done!"""
1,Worthless Metal,"Stay as far away from this game as you possibly can! It's a waste of precious money. Save it for the upcoming games like Gundam Side Story, Front Mission 3, or Resident Evil Code Name Veronica."
3,An Semi-fun game,"It does take a lot of time, there is no music, however Ithought it was sort of fun because you use a lot of strategy. Sure,it might be boring, but if you look at it in a different perspective it is fun. I gave it a 3 because there is some parts in the game that is lame. On one of the levels it was really hard. The one thing about this game is that you can't die."
3,A solid game,"I wouldn't give this game 4 or 5 stars because I reserve those for my favorites. However, though at first play this game may disappoint, it will become fun once you learn some strategies. This is not a charge-in and blow stuff up game. You slowly maneauver your tank around mountains and rain shells upon enemy bases. There is no lock-on target, no pumped-up music, nothing you'd expect. But the weather effects and the ambience are excellent. You can even hear the Doppler effect as a mortar is launched. And your tank can also get frustratingly stuck in snow. With 21 missions this is loaded. I take my time and spend an hour per mission, patiently eating away at my enemies. I could just as well take far less time because you have unlimited lives and enemies don't regenerate. If you like Scorched Earth or projectile games you'll like this simulation. Just don't pay more for this game than you would on Chinese take-out."
1,pro gamer,this game is not what it looks like. the multiplayer is fun with lots of cool fire power. in single player they do not say what the objective is. just one of the weird things about this game. BOTTEM LINE: do not get this game it is a ok but not what you think it is.
1,Wild Metal? Far From Wild.,"I hate to write bad reviews, but this time I have to. I bought this game its first day out, I should have waited to read someones review. There is no story..none, no interesting action, uncomfortable controls, boring scenery, little interaction with ""enemies"", etc.. This game seems to have just been made to add to the amount of titles available on Dreamcast, shame on you RockStar games. The graphics are nintendo in nature, which will really bore you. Be wise and buy something with a plot."
2,Not a very good Wrestling book.,"I bought this book recently for cheap on Ebay. I had heard it wasn't a very good read, but I like to judge things for myself. Well, what I heard was pretty accurate. Chyna mostly talks about her bad parents and how she got screwed over time and time again, jumping from one mistake to the next. She never really places any blame on herself for her bad fortune.Anyway, being a wrestling book, there is really little talk of wrestling. She talks more about competing in fitness contests than wrestling, but when she does talk wrestling its mostly about training with Killer Kowalski (she seems bitter toward him too), her ""good housekeeping"" match with Jeff Jarrett, and getting hired by the WWF because of Triple H and ""Sean"" Micheals.It just isn't a good read. She jumps around a LOT and instead of talking about more interesting things like almost working for the FBI and secret service, all she wants to do is go on bitter rants about how much she got screwed over."
1,dont waste your money,"After hearing so much hype about Chyna's book I finally got the chance to read it, & boy was I disasppointed. ... Where Mick Foley's book made you feel good about being a wrestling fan, Chyna's had the opposite effect on me. I wonder if she actually enjoys the sport herself as she comes across very bitter and resentful. Do we really need to hear on ever second page about how lousy her parents were? Ok, she had a rough life. So do lots of other people. But she seems to be very negative about everything. And I'm no prude but the language in this book was way too rough, especially as she has a lot of young kids who idolise her. I've read a lot of books by wrestlers and they are more upbeat and interesting to read than Chyna's. She seems to put down everyone who had a hand in her success and thinks she's god's gift to wrestling. Even Dynamite's book had a more positive message than this one. I felt like I had to go wash my hands after putting this book down."
2,"Big, beautiful, but ....","I have always been a fan of Chyna the wrestler, and found her to be a talented and beautiful performer. Listening and reading unscripted interviews with Ms. Laurer has proved to me she's far more than just a pretty face or big muscles.Unfortunately, this ""autobiography"" does her no favors. She comes across as a petty, resentful woman, filled with contempt for other people. Yes, she's risen above a tough early start, and still has a lot of justified anger toward her parents and other people who've stepped on her, but she doesn't show how she's transcended it.The book itself is very poorly written, with too much unnecessary profanity and as many tangents as spokes on a bicycle wheel. It's also filled with comparsions and similies that the real Joanie Laurer would never use.I don't like ripping this book too much, because I feel for Ms. Laurer and like Chyna, but it's a bad book, plain and simple."
1,Very annoying voice.,I own several audio books and the person who read this story has a very distinct voice that is like nails on a chalk board. Gilbert gets hit over the head with a book not a slate. I couldn't listen to it anymore after that point.
5,Great for any fan of Full House,On one side of the book D.J. talks about her thoughts and on the other side Stephanie talks about her thoughts. They each enter their families in the big happy family of the year. Will they win? Find out by reading this book.
2,A text resource,It is true the book provides helpful ideas on how to interepret difficult texts from the Bible. But if you are looking for SIGNS to be included you will be disappointed. Somehow I think the title may be a little misleading for those searching for Sign(not text)Language resource books.
4,Bret Screwed Bret,"First Off, Bret Hart Might Of Been ""screwed"" But He Had It Coming. He Was Leaving The WWE For WCW. A Move That Ended His Career As He Never Recoverd And Became High Profile Again. Lets Not Forget Madussa's Dropping Of The WWE Womens Title Into A Garbage Can On WCW Live On TV. WWE Didnt Want Bret Hart To Do The Same, After All He Was Schedule To Be On WCW Following Night After The 1997 Survivor Series. Think About It For A Moment. If This Was Low Down And Dirty And A Case Of ""Vince Screwed Bret"" Why Did Owen Hart And British Bulldog Remain Loyal With The WWE. Nuff Said!"
1,I think that the Hitman was servely screwed by McMahon.,"I thought that this is one of the most controversy pay-per-viewin history. Just because Bret Hart signed a 3yr. deal with WCW, thatdoesn't give Mcmahon the right to screw Hart. Ecspecially in Hart's hometown of Canada. Other than that, there was a highlight of the night when Austin won the IC title."
5,Poo,"I am called Timothy John Arthur Atack and I like to eat pies. I live at no.52 Faraday Avenue, Sidcup Kent"
4,Survivor Series 1997 - Gang Rulz,"You're right. It was a good show with a bad ending. This PPV don't have a 5 star cause of this screw job. If The Hitman would've get screwed The Hitman would've fought HBK for the title at Wrestlemania 14 and killed him and there will be a feud between The Hart Foundation & DX. For Austin, he'll battle Mike Tyson, similar to Bam Bam and LT in Wrestlemania 11."
4,Controversy!!!!!!!,"This event was the most talked about WWF Pay Per View in the history of sports entertainment. With the WWF Championship on the line, Champion-Bret Hart defends against WWF European Champion-Shawn Michaels. Keep your eyes on Vince McMahon. The WWF Intercontinental Title goes on the line when Champion-the late great Owen Hart defends against Stone Cold Steve Austin. Kane vs. Mankind in a awesome but brutal encounter. Plus the traditional Survivor Series elimination tag matches which include stars like the Rock, Ken Shamrock, New Age Outlaws, British Bulldog, Vader, and many others."
3,WWF Survivor Seies 1997 review,"All the Survivor Series elimination tag team matches were not great but pretty good. The Kane-Mankind match was a solid & hard-hitting brawl. The IC title match between Steve Austin & Owen Hart was short but sweet. The world title match between Bret Hart & HBK while not a bad match,it will only be remember for the infamous doublecross and nothing else. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10."
4,*The* Book for Digital Imaging,If you are interested in Digital Imaging this is your best bet to get started. Every halftoning technique invented so far is reviewed and presented in an easy and understandable fashion.
2,"Good, but not the only book you will need.","This book does contain some useful information, unfortunately the author seems to asume that the reader has considerable experience with the subject. Most of the information though is quite outdated as the book does not touch on any of the newer techniques. I also feel that the book does not explain the subject matter enough to be able to write software implementations, and more than once I have had to go looking elsewhere for more information. In a nutshell, it is a good 'reference book for certain topics', and i'd advise you to borrow it from a library instead of purchasing it."
2,"Good, but no maps","This is a good guide with a lot of information, but be forewarned: the Kindle edition does not have any maps."
1,Works great!,"I bought two of these for my wife. The flower design is pretty and goes with almost any outfit. The velcro makes them easy to put on and take off, and they function just as expected: the outer cloth layer absorbs liquids and the inner waterproof layer protects clothes. They are long enough to protect her lap, too, if spills run down. Product more than meets expectations, looks attractive, easy to use, and inexpensive."
3,Priva Mealtime Protector,"My mom's first remarks were concerning the protector ""hanging off her neck"". And she doesn't like the lengthy portion down on her lap (I replied that it keeps her lap from getting slopped up). The protector hasn't gotten any use since then, but I expect her to try it some more as various foods present staining problems, like spaghetti, etc.She's been eating without it, risking staining, and I intend to be proactive in getting her to use it as I have to do her laundry and buy her clothes as well. Stain removal is at a premium, product price-wise, and I find, is nearly non-existent with current products --nothing works... pens, sticks, blues, etc. And bleach...Aaaaaa!And the protector cannot help her with getting her sleeves into things (how did she get coffee all over her sleeve?!)."
4,"good, cute","i bought this for my mom, they are really big which is great, look cute, and absorb perfectly. The only reason i give it four stars is that after three months of using and washing, the fabric has started to look old and worn... but this happens with most protectors. Overall a great product."
4,Quite good,"While it tends to be somewhat repetitive after a while, this is a very good record. I would have given it 5 stars but these japanese imports are simply too expensive. The music is really quirky and innovative: a mix of loud guitars and electro that is quite unique. There is a very japanese feel over it which is a plus and which is as usual very refreshing. They have produced consistently excellent records over the years that are somewhat hard to get."
4,Good deal,"I have instructed drivers in Time Trial events with this unit, and have found it very useful. This is the lowest price I've seen.One word of caution though -- when shutting down, don't pull the headset out of your helmet, take your helmet off with the headset in it still and plenty of slack on the wires. Pulling the headset out of your helmet tends to weaken then seperate the wires in the earpiece, and this happens quickly."
1,Nady PMC-2X intercom,Received as a gift. The unit worked somewhat for about 1-1/2 hours of careful use then one of the headsets failed. Nady promised a replacement on July 26 but did not replace the unit. Nady ignored about 5 inquiries about why the unit was not replaced. I would avoid any item made by this company.
4,Great entry level communication system,"As an instructor at a driving school, I've used this Nady unit for a few years to communicate between driver and instructor through the helmets. It works fine, even in open cars. The controls work out well. The headsets are durable, even when the students rip the headphone out of their helmets by the cord. The headsets have actually lasted longer than the unit itself. The unit didn't start to go out, it would create a loud screeching sound in which I had to hold onto the inputs in case it happened again. Now, about three years later, it works about 70% of the time. I keep it as a backup, but have since upgraded to a Chatterbox unit. But for the price, and length of time I've used the Nady unit, it has worked out well."
1,Didn't make the grade,"The first one sent to me did't work at all. The replacement worked - but only when standing still. As soon as we were underway, the static was so bad that we couldn't hear each other. Not what they said it was so I'm still looking...."
2,Active noise cancellation would make this usable.,"I own this unit and find that it works quite well -- below 45 mph. I have a Honda VFR800 Interceptor (sport-touring bike) with an aftermarket Zero Gravity Double Bubble windshield which provides quite a bit of wind protection. I also have the factory exhaust on the bike which is fairly quiet.Even inside my Shoei helmet this headset picks up so much wind and engine noise as to render it useless when speeds elevate beyond secondary road limits. I am 5'10"" and my head is in the position of the average rider, I believe. There is nothing which I think could justify the level of noise received back through the system. The noise drowned out my pillion's voice so badly that I just turned the unit off until we left the highway."
4,"Good, but...","I instruct students in high speed racetrack events and have used the PMC-2 sets for years. With a dozen events a year, and multiple students in each event, these don't last very long without breaking. The unit gets banged up in the students car and typically lasts only a year or so. But the biggest problem is the wires to the headsets at the earpeice. I'll second the earlier review: tell your students not to pull them out by the wire - take off the helmet and let the headset fall out on it's own. Nady needs to make the wires more robust. I go thru about 2 sets of headsets a year due to this issue.There isn't a lot of choice in these units, the PMC-2 is by far the most cost effective solution on the market.Also, sidenote, if you are a student in this type of event and your instructor doesn't have one of these or something similar, you don't have a good instructor. The organizing group should make these a requirement."
4,Excellent,Received new in excellent condition. Long and thick emery boards. Multipack. One lasts a very long time. Does not wear out easily like other brands.
3,DISAPPOINTING RETRACTION SYSTEMS,"Belkin products are usually well constructed and long lasting products, but they did not follow through with the retraction systems used on these cords. Cords tangle easily and they feel like they are going to break after a short period of time."
4,No MICRO; however Very Cool!,"I'm a sucker for any thing that connects stuff to other stuff. However, I should have read the fine print because there's no Micro USB adapter! Cmon Belkin.However, the product comes in a tidy and useful zip up case with just about everything you might run into even if you aren't an IT professional. If you are a tinkerer or traveling; or just helping the non-tech crowd set up their router this comes in handy.In my experience all retractable cable are a mixed bag; eventually they foul up unless you are extremely careful. I thought about putting a mini-to micro adapter but then I remembered that there are often data throughput problems (it'll charge though)For you apple people, take the mini usb-pop a micro usb adapter on it; then pop a 30 pin male to female micro on it. Its clunky but it will charge. A micro to 30 pin does data throughput as well.My only complaint: No Cat 3 adapters!"
2,not great,"I ordered this pack to carry with my laptop, but amazingly it does not come with a microUSB adapter and the retractable cables are surprisingly short, the adapters are gigantic and the case is overly thick while offering little padding"
1,unable to recognize usb device,"it worked for a while, but i'm getting an error message from my printer about how it's not getting recognized.i purchased a printer usb cable and will have to see if that takes care of the problem, which i suspect it will.if it doesn't, i'll be sure to change the one star review."
3,Build Quality-Challenged,"I bought this and when I was about to retract the USB cable, the plastic in the middle part of the retracting metal cracked. It won't retract back anymore. I don't know if its an isolated case or the delivery might have caused the damaged but I lost faith in its build quality immediately. Good thing it was easy to return this to amazon. So I did and just decided to look for another set of pc accessories."
3,What? No tip for Motorola/samsung/kindle (all same Tip) YIKES!,"glaring overisght to not have a the tip for Motorola/samsung/kindle all same tip, mostly the main one I need.Nice priduct if you don't need that tip, but I do, so returning"
3,No micro USB,"Nice kit from Belkin, a well respected company. The only shortcoming was there isn't a micro USB connector. Other than that well worth the money."
5,Wonderful Set,"The accompanying book is extremely enriching, unlike many of the texts that accompany decks. And the cards themselves? They are extremely beautiful and intuitive! The images are delicatey rendered with an airy and classic feel. However, if renditions of male nudity are not to your liking this is definitely not a set for you!"
5,Awesome,These cards are just awesome! They are beautifully designed and will just take your breath away. The book has complete details about the meaning of the cards. This is one hot item that I highly recommend.
5,Micheal martin Murphy,it is one of the best cds i have heard in a long time i ordered it for my husband for christmas and we listen to it all the time
4,Good tool for the price,"Tool as described works well, will see how it holds up in the future. Would recomend for a weekend warrior."
5,"quick ship, just as advertised",Another easy transaction with this supplier. Almost immediate shipping and the items received in pristine condition. The book itself is well known to be critical for Alfa owners so not much more to say on that subject.
4,Fun Gift,"Our Granddaughters have a lot of fun with this gift, and it gives them a creative outlet and fun together"
3,beawer...,THIS SET IS OK FOR A STARTER KIT FOR SCHOOL OR CHURCH. BUT NOT AT HOME. ROLLING PIN MADE DOH STICK TO IT. THE MOLD HAD DOH STUCK AND HARD TO GET OUT.THE SCISSORS DID NOT CUT TO GOOD.

1,I Love being swindled!,Anything that comes from Profit Popoff must be divine inspiration on how to reap wealth for himself! It's a really great way to bring in a lot of wealth! I am feeling a large transfer of wealth from the pockets of the poor and uneducated to the large jingling pocket of the Profit Popoff!
2,Recipe Book smells of mold,"The book was mailed and received quickly, but there was no cover jacket and it smells of mold. I was disappointed."

1,ladies home journal cookbook,"Cookbook purchased ""used very good condition"". It arrived badly soiled, with damaged spline. Would not have purchased book, if true condition revealed.Maureen Dow"
1,Image Marketing: Using Public Perceptions to Attain Busines,"Totally lacking in substance, the author never tells the reader that Image is the sum of attitudes and beliefs, that it can be measured and altered using specific techniques. Full of drivel, musings, and short-of-the-mark examples would be bad enough! Ask yourself two questions: Which Credit Card Company uses the phrase ""It's everywhere you want to be""? AND who was the American General made famous by his role in Desert Storm? Of course, they are VISA and ""Stormin' Norman Schwartzkopf, right? Well Marconi blunders on these examples in the book by citing American Express, and ARNOLD Schwartzkopf. (page 89 and 134). Gimme a Break."
4,Chatty and straight-forward information on Image,"A helpful, easy-to-read book on the complex subject of Image-Marketing and a great primer. I felt as if I was sitting in on a lecture or a well-done seminar on the subject. The case studies are good, a little vague at times. Overall, for anyone dedicated to the awesome power of Image Marketing, this is one of the books that should be considered for your library. Not discussed are the all-important image archetypes, but there are other titles for this.Derek Armstrong, Author of The Persona Principle, How to Succeed in Business with Image Marketing (ISBN0684802694)."
3,adjusting the timing,"If your spider's like mine, then any specifications you find won't be right. You just have to do it by feel."
3,It's a start,"I wanted a beginner type book that focused only on Roman Shades. While this book did contain some helpful information, I would have liked more specifically on the topic of Roman Shades, written at a level easy enough for a relative beginning sewer to follow successfullly. If someone wanted a more general approach to a number of winder covering options, this would be a great choice."
1,better used as a boat anchor period!,"better used as a boat anchor period! not even joking, totally worthless, never worked and Haier very unhelpful. i'll never buy anything else from them again and shame on target for even selling it. bought a fridigaire that blows this thing's doors off just by actually working!"
1,Not worth the money or effort to set up.,"Not having lived in a home with a basement before I shortly realized that our new basement was moldy. Our landlord informed us that we had what was called a ""Michigan Basement"" and would be frequently smelly even though it was finished with carpet and a bath. We bought this dehumidifier thinking it could handle the dampness but it barely lasted a winter and summer. The motor has burned up even though I frequently cleaned the coils and filter. It's heavy and doesn't roll well so I can move it around from room to room. I think it worked well for maybe 6 months."
1,Worst piece of appliance I ever had,"The first one worked for a month, then quit. I returned it to Best Buy for an exchange. The second one worked till the end of the summer, but never worked again a year later. Called support, for $14 fee, they sent me a replacement. The replacement was a refurbished unit and came with a crack, but worked. I was hoping it was going to be an Ugly Duckling. But my hopes were shattered two weeks later: some smell and no water in the bucket. At this poit I want to believe there's something I'm doing wrong, but there's no science to operating a dehumidifier. I'm sticking with the alternative: the product sucks, and I'm surprised Best Buy would carry something like this."
1,Stopped working - such a waste,"Just adding another review so that others won't buy this product. Mine ran for a year. Now all the lights come on but nothing happens; no fan starting, no water removal."
1,Read This Before You Buy,"The first Haier we purchased failed to work properly right out of the box. After contacting the company and sending them the power cord, they shipped a replacement. The second unit was a scratched and dented refurbished model. Haier refused to send a new one even though our appliance was brand new. The second unit worked for about a week, then it started leaking some kind of oily grease which ruined the carpet we had just installed. We'll never purchase a Haier product of any kind again."
2,Bad Noise,"I've owned the C-2500L Camedia since it first came out; which is a long time at the time of this writing.It's not capable of low-no noise photos. Whether it be TIFF or JPEG no matter the resolution. I've tried every setting arrangement under Manual->Aperture->Picture modes. It's less apparent under high lighting, but you can still see it over dark colors. Despite what people say slower shutter speed doesn't help.My new $400 Sony ultra compact takes drastically better images than this unit does. My PV-GS320 camcorder even out performs it."
1,"cute, but not helpful","I wore this part of my pregnancy, and people always said something about it because they could see it through my shirt, and the pink balls fade in the sunlight. Plus if something snags it, shirts, basically anything it hurts so incredibly bad that I cried one time. I do not recoment this I would say don't go with the plastic, or don't wear one at all. I wore my regular metal one."
4,Fulani social life,I worked over a period of 15 and one half year among Fulani people in Niger. Riesman's book gives alot of good and accurate insights about Fulani life and culture. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the Fulani in that part of the world.
3,Red Ink,The content itself is excellent. However the book is very difficult to read due to it being in red. It is very hard on the eyes and difficult to see.
1,It is the worst mandolin strings,"These strings have no end metal pieces to hook on the mandolinI must use the round little pieces of metal from old strings for the new set. It took me 2 hours to put them inHow horrible is it, you can not imagine how angry I am. They just save a couple of pennies to waste hours of the customers.At the end I broke one E string too.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT and remember donot buy anything made in CHINA either"
2,"out of all the bug accessories, this is the biggest waste","we have a frog with ALL the accessories and love the stroller. but this product isn't a very useful accessory as it's not big enough to cover the child if you're moving around. it looks cute if you're stationary as it matches the stroller, but we keep this in storage."
1,not good,these things broke the second day my son had them they lasted no time I didnt like them at all.
5,Acrylic Box,"These are great, they fit into a drawer nicely and are so much cheaper in price then the container store. I organized all the drawers in my kitchen and bathrooms. The only tiny con is the lid is sometimes hard to get off, might want to leave the lids off if you have hand problems like arthritis. It's a pro if you have little kids wanting to get into them."
3,"Moving, yet biased collection.","As a Korean adoptee, I relate to many of the ideas that the authors are putting forth. I know and understand what it is like to struggle with this identity. To experience growing up as an Asian American in an all white community, and then have your Asian American identity hit you like a mack truck. I know what it is like to want to deny that part of yourself. I understand the feelings of hurt, of frustration and confusion. However, I am also beginning to understand the pride in being Asian American. And part of the reason that I am able to do this is because of the support and love of my parents. I feel that many of the poetry and prose that the editors have included in this anthology has negative connotations towards the adoptive parents. I know some really wonderful adoptive parents, including my own. I simply worry that people who are reading this book from outside of adoption will think that all adoptive parents are horrible and all adoptees are maladjusted."
5,Leaning to Cook,"I recommend Linda's first cookbook very highly. I couldn't get past boiling an egg or preparing a simple sandwich before I bought this excellent book. It has all the basic information for beginning cooks as well as challenging recipes for more advanced cooks, presented in a warm and friendly manner. All the meals are gratifying to prepare and to eat. I've had numerous non-vegetarian friends and family express total shock at how delicious a veggie meal can be - after stuffing themselves! I now have dozens of cookbooks, yet, years later this is still my #1 cookbook and I turn to it whenever I need traditional recipes such as a simple cheese quiche. I've graduated to Linda's other cookbooks and now even have the confidence to create my own recipes, thanks to Linda."
2,Well... the Meatless Loaf was awful...,"Perhaps it's unfair to judge an entire book based on one recipe. But it is arguably the featured recipe in the book, her prized Meatless Loaf. So I made it. It never set up. It came out with the consistency of creamy mashed potatoes. Tastes good, but nothing like a ""loaf"" at all. And I followed the recipe EXACTLY, to the letter. A lot of time and a fair amount of money invested in a recipe that didn't work."
4,Linda's lifestyle ideas,"Good recipes- helpful information on ingredients. This book is good value,the world needs more people with Linda's views on life."
5,Masters of Origami: The Art of Paperfolding : at Hangar-7,An amazing gallery of designs to inspire the enthusiast and provide beginners with some inspiration. The projects are all quite challenging.
3,does genius really need copyright,"beautiful projects, no schemas. I don't dare to compare myself to such performers, I cannot create anything by myself so why not provide 2/3 schemas just to have fun?"
5,This is timeless music,"This is an essential CD in my collection. It's not mainstream... You may hear one song off the whole cd on the radio, but , to me, that's a positive thing. Each song has a personality all its own. In an age when you buy a CD only to find that the one song you've already heard 5000 times is the only decent song on it, this would be a refreshing change.Buy it and listen to it whenever you need some energy."
2,Dreadful,"I used to have this CD, but got so sick of it I tossed it out of my car window. This album is a mixture of some of the Violent Femmes' hits (which is why I bought the CD in the first place) and some awful music that just shouldn't have been released. If you want to find out what the Violent Femmes were really about, purchase their first and self titled album ""Violent Femmes"" which contains most of their famous songs and is a much more coherent album. This is not worth your money."
5,The whole CD is awesome!!!,The songs are very unique. I think the artists are very talented and I love all of the songs!
2,Selfcongratulations,Ford promo for new GT model with cursory look back at the original GT40s. Insufficient coverage of old GT's no real detail photos and drawings for new GT.
5,Tri-phase Performance module,"This module really works. I noticed more tork and power after installation. My 2001 Nissan Frontier, Crew cab always felt underpowered. Though I still would like more; in the 1st or 2nd, higher position modes, I think it uses more gas, couple miles less per gallon, but the performance increase is worth it. Hardest part of installing was locating somewhere in cab to mount control box. Anyway, for the money, this is a great buy and I would reccommend it highly."
1,Da na da na naaa,"That one star is for the soundtrack (gotta love 8 bit music!), perhaps the game could have earned some stars if it was at all playable. How do you play this game? How do you advance? what is your goal supposed to be? These are just some of the questions the game fails to answer. Those, if you aren't aware, are pretty basic question. Too bad, cuz it could have been good."
5,Can't get any better and I've seen them all,"It has graphs, charts and detailed maps. All the info you wanted on planes and fighters is here. If you like modern planes, you'll love this book."
3,Not Bad for the Price,"Pro: Every piece was able to be fitted to tub/shower, replacing dated OEM gold trim.Con: The ""brushed nickel"" finish highlights water spots, especially on spout and handle plate. Finish does not match (or remain spotless like) our Moen brushed nickel lav faucets; actual nickel content appears nil in these pieces. Spots do clean-up fine (but could become a daily chore).The tub spout had to be taken apart and adjusted a couple of times to be able to fit our copper pipe without leaking at the wall. Also used alot of teflon tape and silicon grease on spout pieces to eliminate leaks. Our spout issues may be abnormal as wall-pipe was not perfectly pristeen."
2,Looks Good but Cheesy,This item does include all the components necessary to change over to a brushed nickel look. However the metal on the valve plate is very thin and the tub spout leaks back toward the wall when in the shower position from the slide on fitting unless you tinker with it as I did several times to get it to stop. I had to adjust the depth of the copper pipe going into the tub spout by moving the white nylon ring back and forth in the tub spout. If you're not handy or are going to be at all rough with these components they will not last. Also the screws sent to replace the overflow cover were to small necessitating a trip to the hardware store.
4,Danco Trim Kit,The kit has everything I needed to update my old fixtures and is very easy to install. I would have preferred a lever handle but I couldn't find one. This looks much better than the old one I had.
3,Danco Head-to-Toe Trim Kit for Moen Chateau Single-Handle Tub and Shower Faucets,"Danco Head-to-Toe Trim Kit for Moen Chateau Single-Handle Tub and Shower Faucets I was thinking this pruduct was brand New,I go a rifurbish packged,nest time will be colling first to check what I'm buying on Amazon.com"
5,A great book for quilters at all levels,"The quilting projects in Row by Row are wonderful just as they are, but more than that, they can be expanded upon or adapted to whatever your tastes and interests are. You will find some great ideas for using up those ""theme"" fabrics and fat quarters in your stash. There's also an easy process for personalizing your quilts-whatever your message is, you can say it with fabric! I can also see where these projects would be great for guilds and quilting groups. I can't wait to get started!"
3,Does anyone think it funny,"Does anyone think it funny that most of the reviews here contain spelling and grammar errors? I'm making more money than any of the MBAs that have commented here, and I never graduated from college! Spare yourself the book and the cost of an MBA, and learn Peoplesoft or SAP."
5,This is an essential purchase for those serious about an MBA,"This book will see you down the long, tricky road of business school admissions. It is organized, well-written, and provides practical (though innovative) tips for marketing oneself to top MBA programs. The author addresses specific weaknesses/assets and how best to capitalize upon them in you applications. Best of all, he author takes the fear and uncertainty out of essay writing by providing keen insight into what B-schools are looking for. During the most crucial period of the MBA application process, I had to leave the US unexpectedly for 9 months for work. Fortunately, I took Richard Montauk's book along. It enabled me to plan out a strong (and ultimately successful) strategy and organize the submission of my applications despite being far from schools and recommenders. This book is truly different from the rest of the guides out there. Fabulous."
2,Old Info.,"This book has some good suggestions, but how valid are they? The book was printed in 1996 and the writer hasn't bothered to revise it! The choice of schools reviewed is outdated - some are not even top rated now, and this section on the programs of B schools in the USA and abroad takes up the bulk of the book. It is useless data. You cannot rely on the information given about requirements, courses, etc. of each school because it most likely has changed a lot since 1996. In summary I suggest: Buy it USED."
3,If you dont know anything this book is for you!,This book is great if you don't have a clue. Many of the tips are not exactly what I would call the insiders guide for getting into a top MBA program. Things not to forget are Executive job experience and that record setting GMAT score. No job experience or never held a top management position you say!? Well then you had better be some kind of business prodigy that can laugh while taking the GMAT. However the book did have numerous essays and examples of accepted applicants. This book was also easy reading and can be read in less than two days. Because I felt the book was just a rehash of other material floating around I only gave it a 3.
3,I'll pass,"If you're as bright as it takes to get in one of these schools to begin with this book will just annoy you. The only reason why I think anyone would buy this book is just reconfirm what they want to hear. This book has no real hidden secrets that some clam. But if you think it will help you, by all means order it."
1,How to WASTE your money,"This is amongst the least helpful books I have read. A lot of pages explain things which everyone already knows - like if you do not have a high GPA, high GMAT etc., apply to multiple schools. A lot of material is easily available on the Internet with very little effort.SAVE YOUR MONEY and look up on the NET instead."
1,Waste of Money,"Save your money, this blowhard claims to have all the answers. He has no insight that you won't have yourself. Keep true to yourself and follow your own creative direction. This so called expert is only making a career out of peddling bad advice."
2,Nothing New,"Don't waste you time Unless you have a minimum GPA of 3.45 from a top school, GMAT in the mid 650+, and Executive job experience. This book provides the basics assuming that you have the above. I question the experience other readers are claiming to have with this book. For starters if you're at this level of the game this book may just tickle your ego. But be prepared a huge assumption on your part is made that you are already one of the players. And trust me you would know if your one of these people."
5,MBA Applicant - Must read,"When I started with the process I grossly underestimated my candidacy because I was evaluating myself only based on my stats(UG school, GPA). But after reading this book I realized that a whole lot of other things mattered and at the end of it I actually started believing that I deserved to get into a top school.To cut a long story short, I got into the EWMBA program at Haas and I could not have done it without this book."
2,Average book,"I bought ""how to get into top MBA"" before applying to HBS, Wharton, Columbia, Kellogg and Dartmouth. THis book did help me a bit but it lacks some key information. I wish that it features more focus and insights about the very schools I was applying to. Application is very competitive..so this kind of information are crucial to ""make or break"". I have heard that application have jumped 35% this year at HBS!!"
1,Waste of money,There is nothing in this book that is going to help you. It just goes on and on and on with very common sense things that you already know or would know if you did even the smallest amount of research on the Internet.
4,Excellent with few reservations,"This book is excellent. It helps you from square one. It gives you worksheets to help you get your plan of attack together. Very insightful and detailed. My copy is completely tatered! My only reservation about this book is it didn't cover enough of the schools and the essays chosen were from people who seemed to have exceptional experience - or maybe that's the point! Still, I don't work on my essays without referring to this book."
4,A astonishingly well balanced book on such an earthly matter,"Murry Hope`s book on the question whether Atlantis is Myth or Reality is an astonishingly well-balanced work for someone who was a founder of the Atlantean Society and therefore tends to be biased towards the very existence of Atlantis .As an Atlantean from the heart of Europe actually living on the remaining islands of Mu right now so to speak(though I tend to challenge the existence of both continents), it was a pleasure to read, but the book also gave me again the insight as so many books on the subject do, that the more we might feel the real presence of Atlantis the more we wind up in mystery."
4,What a Great Book!,"This book turns the ""Complete Idiot"" into the ""Complete Aficionado"". Very comprehensive and extensive information provided on the many topics of Cigars. Tad Gage doesn't just say HOW things are done such as storing, cutting, lighting etc. but WHY they are done. A good read which will teach everyone, novice or expert, something new about cigars. I felt what the book needed to make it 5-star was a few more diagrams and some more colour pictures to illustrate some of its points. Nevertheless, a very good read !"
4,Wonderful Beginners Book,"This book is wonderful if you are a beginner. It goes step by step through the making, cutting, and smoking a cigar. A great book to read with a big stogie between your fingers!"
3,decent but not outstanding,Plenty of editorial errors and poor grammar make this book a sub-optimal read. The information is good but the presentation is lackluster. There are better options out there.
4,"Good, slow read","I'm an aero engineer, so I found the technical details excellent. The view points of the budgets, politics, and interplay with world events were also great. The debates and decisions in the early 70's of what to do after Apollo are very similar to our national debates in 2011 about NLS, Constellation, etc. Highly recommend."
4,The review,it was avery informatice book. good for people interest in the rpoblems of Africa or a view into what it is really like.
3,OK as a very broad overview for beginners,"The title of this book doesn't reflect its very broad coverage. Indeed, the book discusses a wide range of PR topics, as well as marketing communications and advertising. For this reason, the book is suitable for an undergraduate-level introductory course on corporate communications. However, while the information presented is clear and relevant, it lacks depth. Students who want to pursue PR and marketing writing as a career will want to supplement this book with other resources."
3,Heterosexist and Reductive,"This book unthinkingly and un-apologetically promotes an essentialist, hetero-sexist approach to to gender and relationship. As such, it's outdated and problematic. Despite these troubling shortcomings, many people interested in existing (i.e., socialized) gender differences and their effects on men and women who happen to be involved in conventional gender-romances (or even in friendships between members of the opposite sex) would no doubt find this book thought-provoking and interesting. Thus the 3 (not 1 or 5) stars."
3,"informative, but long","as a triathlete myself, I picked this book up to see how my world was written, and I come away with a middling feeling. It was interesting, with triathlon history in it, but the book was drawn out too much in my opinion. It was like reading a textbook."
3,"Not as ""insightful"" as I was led to believe.","If you've read the Clifford Roberts book and are an ardent follower of the tournament, you will be disappointed. What I was expecting versus what was delivered were 180 degrees apart. Mr. Eubanks would have done better to explore more of the relationship between the National and the residents and town of Augusta. Eubanks needed to delve more into more recent tournament history (post 1980) as opposed to dedicating more to the period from 1933-1960. I'll be attending my fifth Masters Tournament in 1998 (4th in a row) and I hope to talk with some residents/patrons who have attended many tournaments throughout the years."
2,Disapointment,I expected more CDs seeming how there were alot of stuff that was suppose to be in the set. But I only got 3 DVDs. The seller I bought it from did not say that it was imported. Beware of the bootlegs.
5,anime that makes us laugh,"There are few comedic works as good as Love Hina. Life in Hinata Hot Springs is a seemingly endless amusement, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud over and over again. Love Hina as an anime is only mildly less amusing than its manga counterpart, and reminds us that the only real reason we liked it in the first placed was for all the comedic violence."
5,My second review on this author's books,"I just finished reviewing this author's WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS so also see that review so I don't need to repeat the same things again about having met the author at nationals, etc...I do feel that this author's books are are best series of chess books for kids. UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS goes hand in hand with WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS. I Understand what the author was doing with his books now.That is after having written CHESS FOR JUNIORS which is the author's beginning book it is now on the top of the list of ALL chess books on Amazon.com the author obviously needed the next level of books. UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS uses games as lessons. It uses games that provide good ideas with many different themes. I just got my copy about a month ago after reading WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS and feel that UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS will also help me gain a lot of rating points."
1,mediocre book by a convict,"First, I have read most of the unrevised version. It is an OK chess book. However, there are many better books available. Chernev's Logical Chess move by move and McDonald's Art of Planning in Chess are both clearly superior. Your time would be better served with these books.The main reason for this review is Snyder is a criminal who has been prosecuted and convicted of molesting children. He has a long, terrible history. Some players I know have told me some details. His criminal record is public. So he is not the type of author you should support. Especially as not one of his books are essential for any player. Your money would be better spend on other authors."
5,Best Game Analysis for the Intermediate Player,"I found this book to be both instructive and fun to read! The very first game starts off with a fantastic ""King Hunt"" where the King is driven across the board. The final result will suprize you! The book shows you how to build up Kingside attacks in a couple of neat games too.The book also showed some improved ideas in the openings I use. I enjoyed how clearly a couple of the endgames were covered.A well rounded book with a lot of neat ideas not found in other books."
5,My favorite chess book,"I am rated over 1100 by the United States Chess Federation and am in the 5th grade.This is my favorite chess book because of several reasons. One thing is that it is perfect for my level. This is because it is easy to read and easy to understand. My friend who is even higher rated and older than me likes it a lot also and feels the same way.It has lots of diagrams and does not make things so complicated that I cannot understand the variations. I especially like the double King Pawn openings which are my favorite.It also teaches how to attack, sacrifice and think ahead telling you how to plan things."
5,A great first game collection book for students,"Once you have finished reading the first book in the series, ""Chess For Juniors"" I recommend getting this book along with ""Art of the Checkmate"" and ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"". You will have a fantastic basic library if you are either a student or a chess teacher (with materials for years worth of classes!).""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"" goes into great detail (without making it difficult to follow or difficult to understand) covering the ideas and concepts behind the strategy of each of the twenty-four games in the book. A move by move commentary is used. This is a very user friendly way of covering games and forming quality lessons from them.The book is excellent for learning openings and improving middle game strategy. This should be any students first book of games."
5,Finding Joy,Finding Joy: 101 Ways to Free Your Spirit and Dance with LifeI was impressed with this seller. The product arrived in record time and in perfect condition. It was exactly as described. I did not experience out of stock or damaged condition as I have with other book orders I have placed.
5,Great Book,"After reading ""If the Buddha Dated"", I was eager to read more of Charlotte Kasl's works. I am enjoying this book immensely. This book is about learning to love and accept yourself, and has actual activities to help you on the journey. It is as uplifting as her other book, and the short readings make it a great book to read just before I go to sleep, creating a relaxing, positive end to my day."
5,More than satisfied,"It has been a long time since I have seen the movie. A song came over the radio called ""Doing the butt"" by E.U. Band that performed in the movie. I thought to myself, it would be nice to see that movie again. so I looked around and no one had it, and the only place I can think of was Amazon.com. I purchased it and it was at my house within 3 days. Thank you Amazon. This is my favorite website to shop."
4,GAMMA BABY! GAMMA!,One of the BEST Black folk film made! A Classic! Definitely in the top 10!! Life is like that in BLACK COLLEGES! WWAAKKKE UUUPPP my peoples! Spike Lee is a premiere film maker! True Genius! ....Peace.
2,My least favorite Spike film.....,"I think the light-skinned/dark-skinned issue was a valid one, but I just didn't like the way it was presented here. I found it to be more annoying than anything else. Spike didn't seem to know whether he wanted this to be a drama or a musical. Not one of my favorites at all."
2,"Great movie, bad DVD","Can't add much to the discussion about the movie, but wanted to say that this DVD listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of School Daze. It says it has both full screen and widescreen, but it doesnt."
2,Boring movie,"I thought this movie was boring and not well acted. The musical numbers sort of came out of nowhere. Avoid it. The lighting is really bad. Its a typical Spike Lee movie, and that is not a compliment.I would not want to waste another 2 hours watching it."
3,Pretty Good,"School Daze, director by Spike Lee is a film that was good for its time. This film deals with life on a black college campus in the South. The focus is the fraternity and sorority life there. There are dance numbers, colorful dialogue and the ending of the film is a typical ""Lee"" ending. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
5,A movie with an aquired taste,"School Daze will be interesting to some. But after watching it; a viewer could see in two ways. One, if they went to an all-black college they might look at it with enjoyment. Or, if they didn't go to all-black college, it will make think, ""Did I really miss anything?"""
3,pretty good,"i have long supported all of Spike Lee's films.this one was a very real look into Black Colleges and the Problems faced amongest ourselfs.Looks,Hair,Skin&Class etc.. however some things last to long.the musical aspect doesn't really work except for the SUper Talented&fine Late Phyllis Hyman who sings her heart out.it has it's moments."
3,Fine!,The transaction was fast and friendly. The bag match the description given even though the bag was sent in a different color than described on the box.
2,picture of backpack a bit open to interpretation,"I ordered this bag based on the picture on Amazon and was expecting a backpack that I could hold and sling over my right shoulder, but when I actually got it I could not. It was partly my fault for not reading the title description more accurately I suppose but I based my decision to get it on the picture of the bag strapped over the model's right shoulder.I called the customer service number for the company Amerileather to ask questions about the bag and how the picture on the Amazon site reflected how to use it, but the lady had a hard time understanding me and eventually had to call a second person a man to explain its use.I decided to return the bag.To be fair, it was fairly large and was nice looking. I would have been nice if the strap was adjustable so someone like me could use it like a regular backpack."
2,Adequate,"I bought this hoping it would be great but after owning it for a year or so I'm not to impressed. The mouse doesn't work correctly. I've tried everything I know to fix it and it just appears to be shoddy workmanship. I'm a Lan tech for a living so its not like I don't know what I'm doing. The keyboard is not backlit although it looks like it should be. Sometimes during heavy use I just lose my kybrd and mouse. I have to reconnect to get everything going again. Really annoying. I think I would wait for the new 8000. It looks like it might be pretty nice, but $300, wowzee wow!"
4,well made,the strap is made very well. Only wish I would have realized that it does not come with the rubber block needed to hold on pump etc.That's my fault for not reading the description closer.
5,works as designed,This is meant to secure the pump to the seat or top tube but *not* to hold it there by itself.I'm using it with the Zefal pump on the top tube of my tandem although Zefal instructions for the pump says to install it along the seat tube.Does the same job as the cheaper versions but I used the cheaper ones in the past and after few years start to unravel or the Velcro goes bad. Some are very unpleasant when you hit it with your knee.This one looks and feels quality.
3,Audio Recorder,I like this recorder because it is so small you can carry it right in your shirt or jacket pocket unnoticed. It has lots of features too. My only complaint is that I feel it is a litte pricey. But of course that is not the fault of this seller as they have a MSRP guideline to go by.Overall I am happy with it though.
5,Natural Therapies for Mitral Valve Prolapse,"Not knowing enough about this symptom, Miltral Valve Prolapse, this book was educational as well as thorough. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has been diagnosed with this symptom. I feel much more informed about this symptom, what other body symptoms may be related to Mitral Valve Prolape and also what natural ways we maintain this symptom, without taking prescription drugs which most doctors would prescribe right away."
5,Best Book on MVP!,"I first bought the Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome/Dysautonomia Survival Guide book and was disappointed. I then bought Natural Therapies for Mitral Valve Prolpase and ""bingo"" I now know what to do to deal with this and the easy suggestions are working! This little booklet is a gem! Ronald Hoffman, MD ""gets it"""
5,Natural Therapies for Mitral Valve Prolapse,I thought I knew a lot about Mitral Valve Prolapse; this is the greatest book put together.
1,Dangerous approach to MVP,"This book was written by an irresponsible doctor who doesn't see a problem in exposing patients to serious risks. The theories and treatments he proposes are not clearly backed with scientific research. Most disturbing is this doctor's proposal to eliminate antibiotic for patients with MVP during dental and other cirurgical procedures! the medical literature clearly shows that not using antibiotics can lead to infectious endocarditis which may result in death. If you have MVP and cherish your life, do not buy this book."
1,Disappointing-Read with caution.,"A patient of mine brought this book in for me to review. As a health care professional I must admit that, although the topics are important, I'm unaware of what this author bases his information on. On what grounds does he make his recommendations? Most of what is in this book is for the general population and not necessarily specific to MVPS. For instance, while magnesium is important in many clinical situations, and perhaps also in MVPS, there is no information on the type and dosage, and in which situations magnesium supplements are contraindicated."
1,not as shown on pic,"I ordered these speakers because i already have a couple and wanted to get more of the same. Unfortunately, what was delivered are just plain center speakers meaning without the separate tweeter dome, which makes a lot of difference in sound quality. I dont see how can amazon allow sellers to not accurately show what products they are actually sending the clients. Of course it will be too much trouble to send these back, so buyers beware."
2,Meh,"Not a lot of depth, main female comes off as desperate and and man chasing. After the 5th reference to East London, I couldn't help rolling my eyes; was like hearing boring stories about someone's vacation."
4,"A quick, fun read!","This is a cute easy read. I picked it up and did not put my kindle down until I was done! Melody is a spirited young woman who fears being alone forever. Avery, the vulernable fireman, just moved in down the hall. Add Barney, the troublesome little puppy, to the mix and you end up in love with all three!"
4,A cute but short British romance,"I liked this book because it had a fun little story with a bit of action and it was a page turner but didn't go on forever. Although a fun book, I would not want to read a whole series about these people. I like how the author kept it short and sweet and I wish there were more books like this out there. This is a great book to just chill with and read the story for fun and not have to really be as into it as most other lengthy books."
2,"Easy read, but not much depth","This book is an easy, quick read, but leaves the reader a little disappointed. There isn't much depth. If that's what you're looking for, this is it."
1,Nothing I have not read before,Poor book with obvious content. Took 10m minutes to breeze through it. More available on just about any web site.
5,Great Indian Fare!!!,"I loved this product. i got it for a special deal when Amazon was having a sale, and was pleasntly suprised with the quality of the meal in a pack. Add some brown rice and you are golden. Also got a couple others to check out the variety. My only complaint was that all of the items weren't available to be shipped right after ordering. The delay was an annoyance, but not unbearable."
5,Wonderful Treat,This is a magical gift for all Bardic Song lovers of all generations. This disc contains a vonderfull selection of everybody's favorites.You will not regret buying this disk.
1,As Time Goes By: The Best of Jimmy Durante,"I'm a Durante fan, but the CD - bought for The Spouse - was a disappointment in many respects."
5,As Time goes by Jimmy Durante : The Best of Jimmy Durante Great CD,This CD has some great songs sung in the Jimmy Durante style Truly enjoyable Worth the $$$
5,What Can One Say? . . .,". . . It's Jimmy Durante. That just about says it all. He brings is own, unique persoanlity and charm to these song renditions. And he does it in a way that no one else in the world can duplicate.Durante's one-of-a-kind, and what a pleasure to hear his distinctive voice rendering these beautiful ballads. Yes, everybody adores him, yet cannot exactly figure out what it is he does. Well, whatever it is, Durante's got my vote. Luv it."
4,ImmunoPro,"Well Wisdom ImmunoPro Rx 300 gmsThis product is probably of good quality, though I believe I have some problems to whey in general. So I am not sure if I will use it anymore. I have too many food allergies. This is not the products fault. Nana E"
2,"Nice, but broken","I bought this for my fiance for christmas and he was tickled. He loves it so much that he doesn't want me to buy him a new one once we realized that the time would switch automatically back one hour. We've tried everything, changing to have the atomic on and having it off. Nothing seems to work and since we NEED the alarm clock function to work, it would be nice if we would wake up at the right time and not an hour late!!Like I said, he loves the alarm clock so much he won't let me get a new one.I think it's just our alarm clock that doesn't work."
2,Waste of Time,"The projection doesn't work, the speakers don't sound good, and the light is entirely too bright."
1,Doesn't keep the correct time,I loved the idea of the time being projected on the ceiling and when the time is correct this is a great feature but I still have to use another clock as an alarm clock. I've had this clock for over a year now and so many times the time switches to something random. I have it set on the right time zone and have tried to get it to work properly by setting it both manually and using the atomic time. This clock is not reliable at all. I am scared to use it as an alarm clock because it has failed to keep the right time several times since I bought it. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,good sound when it worked,everything worked except the CD player. it would play one song and quit. all the other options were great.
3,3 months is too short,"I gave this product 3 stars because 3 months is too short for something to start going wrong already. The projection clock has lost a digit, so it only shows 7:0 when it's time to get up. Don't know whether the other digits will survive, but I'm strongly considering returning it before they do. Other features and functions were good. No complaints."
2,Sound Machine CD Clock Radio,"I had to send the first one back it was losing time while plugged in an outlet. 3 hours loss of time daily. So I returned it with no problem at all to Amazon. Amazon was excellent with the return and the shipment of the new clock. However, this clock now also seems to be acting up so I am keeping an eye on it."
2,homedics sound machine,"I have looked all over for an alarm, cd with time projection and was thrilled when I found this, however, the projection bulb, I assume, does not display the first number (12:00 looks like 2:00) and have emailed HoMedics customer service but have not received a response after over two weeks. Very disappointed as I do not relish the thought of trying to send it back, etc."
2,"Sound quality OK, display too bright","I received this as a Christmas present. I thought that the sound quality of the nature sounds was above average (though the ocean still sounds like white noise). I also liked the time projection on the ceiling.Unfortunately, the display is WAY too bright. Even on the dim setting I can turn it away from my bed and still read a book without any other lights on. I also don't like that the radio does not have a digital tuner, and the AM/FM selector is located on the back. I like to flip around stations. Needless to say, I have returned the unit."
2,"Good idea, bad production","i loved the idea of this radio. it had everything i needed. the only things i didn't like about it was, #1) the time display was way too bright. it lit up my entire room and i like my room pitch black when i sleep. #2) the sounds did not sound natural. they sounded computer made and you could tell it just repeated the sound over and over. other sound machines i've had in the past were real sounds recorded and you could never tell when it was in it's loop. so it went back. =("
2,Love the bells and whistles but poor quality parts..,"I love all the bells and whistles with the nature sounds, cd and radio. But right out of the box the cd player didn't work and I had to return it, the second one worked fine for 36 days then the alarm function only worked some of the time, some mornings it didnt't go off at all! The display is defineitely way too bright, even on the lowest setting. Although the features are good the quality of the workmanship is poor. I'm returning it one last time and looking for a better product."
1,"If you want to be late for work, buy this clock!","This clock is a genuine POS. I bought this for my wife for Christmas 2006 because most of the CD clock/radios these days seem to take a PhD to work them (and we only both have master's degrees). Although this one is fairly easy to use, it had a hard time picking up satellite reception no matter where we moved it. A couple of months in it started to occasionally lose satellite connectivity and pick a random time making her late for work. This happened a few times until now it won't sync up with the satellite at all and I can't manually set the clock because it loses my setting when it tries to sync up.On top of that, the projector lens broke the first day I got it, and the radio reception sucks, and sound quality is poor. If you want to waste your money like I did, be my guest, but I wouldn't bother."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CLOCK!!!,"We bought this clock in January and everything was wonderful until now. The one day we woke up to the coffee maker brewing and it startled us why the clock didn't go off. Then we saw that the clock was an hour before. So I reset it and took it off the atomic signal. That didn't work. At 1 AM it searches and corrects itself even if it is off the signal. For the past week and a half we have been using our cell phones as alarm clocks. If we wanted to use our cell phones, we wouldn't have bought this nice clock. I tried to write the comany and I got no responce. I saw in the book they want $10 if we send it back to them for ""repair"". We should just spend a little more and get a better clock."
5,Highly recommended by working professionals in the field!,"I work - as a writer - at a company that designs Web sites for large, prestigious clients. When I decided to learn HTML this is the book that came unhesitatingly recommended by nearly everyone in the Web development department.Clear, concise, and you won't get a hernia picking the thing up. Other tomes may look more impressive, have more pages, and sport much higher price tags, but this book will teach you everything you need to know to be coding right up there with the pros.Wonderfully revised, too - with new information, not just a new cover like some books - I might add."
5,"Clear, concise, well organized","I've been coding in various programming languages for some time now, and I have found the most useful books when you're actually doing the work are the books that have clear, concise information readily available.What I've discovered with books of the programming genre is that most of them attempt to go into a great deal of theory and abstract thought while conveying their message. And while there certainly is an appropriate arena for said discussion, a client site during working hours is not one of them.HTML 4 for the WWW is a fantastic reference guide that will help the reader accomplish many of the basic tasks encountered when coding a static web page. A simple look in the table of contents re-directs the reader to a very understandable step by step approach of how to implement a specific feature.This book should be part of every web developer's library. I highly recommend it."
5,Two Words: GET IT!,"As an Applications Analyst for web integration....this is my transportable (I travel), complete, find-it-now reference. As a neophyte in HTML, I started with the 1st edition.New or experienced....this is your tag and format reference. Use the 3"" reference books for monitor stands and keep this one handy!"
5,WOW!!,"This has been one of the best HTML books I have ordered. A lot of helpful information, and everthing is easy to find."
4,GREAT!!! :-),"This book is GREAT. I did need some pointers in html but i knew some of the stuff and this worked like a refrence book with a lot of pitures. It did not have many color pictures, though. You should buy this book"
1,worthless piece of junk,Author learnt web design fifty years ago and forgot how did she do it.Now she needs to make a buck somehow of this knowledge.No regard for those who gives her money for this piece of junk.Never again will I buy a book with this name on it.
3,Liz is good for a quickie but not a long-term relationship,"It's OK, actually fine if you just want to be told 'how to do it.' Easy to read but lets you down in the logical and verbal consistency departments. Better than most 'quickie guides' nowadays however. (Castro is not a responsive writer, even to fundamental criticisms.)Ed ..."
2,"Quick, but no staying power","Like a hit of caffeine this book that were relevent many years ago, but have since been pushed back into the age of dinosaurs. Rather than concentrating on HTML basics, style, and design. This book is a slapped together list of do's and dont's that might have been useful when the book was started, but have little use in the current designs.This makes age the number one problem of the book. It starts someone off on a path that the best websites have already ditched long ago. Therefore, since the book fails to teach the basics of HTML design and light covers material far out-of-date; it fails to make itself useful."
2,Not a book for true beginners,"I bought and returned this book. Maybe I'm dense, but I use a computer constantly and have published websites using frontpage. I don't know a lick of html so I bought this out of its claim to teach beginners. I didn't get past the first chapter due to numerous terminology uses that apparently required some prereq. I'm still looking for a beginners html book."
3,Not bad. But there is a superior HTML book out there!,"It is not that wonderful, there are plenty of other great books out there that cover much more advanced topics. There are no practical exercises to do, all you do is type in what the author already did. That is no way to learn HTML! All books on this subject fall short..........................After looking through this book for answers, I'm still stuck on what I need to do."
4,good for beginners/non-programmers,"This is a very good book for people with no programming experience. It's a real handholder. The book is short, simple, and everything is taught by example. The organization was good enough that it quickly becomes more of a reference than something you'd read start to finish, even for people that have never seen html before. After reading it I have to wonder how people are making money off those big fat html books when this one has most of what a person would need in 200 pages."
5,Must have book for HTML 4 code,"I find this book a necessary companion for writing code for web design. It gives the user the freedom to develop the pages free from locked in structure that some editors use in writing unwanted code. Also, I find many ideas which Elizabeth Castro explores to be helpful and practical when designing web page elements. I strongly recommend the work for a reference book."
5,HTML 4 for the World Wide Web: Visual Quickstart Guide,"When I first learned HTML, I purchased several ""beginner"" books. They were all confusing and disjointed on how they taught the subject. Then I stumbled across this book. Awesome. I created my first web page from scratch within 30 minutes following the text. To date I use it for reference when I forget a syntax. Because of this book, I've been able to teach HTML classes to volunteer groups...and have even created self starting HTML based CDs for the class. This is a must if you're getting started in HTML. It also serves quite well as a desk reference if you're experienced."
5,The perfect HTML tutor,"As a novice HTML'er, I had low expectations about writing HTML code. I quickly found limitations using Front Page type editors. I purchased this book after reading the online reviews and found it to be the perfect HTML tutor.Showing the code, how it fits into the page and the final result on the display makes this the easy way to learn. You know EXACTLY what to expect as you follow along in the book.When I read through the reviews I notice, with very few exceptions, that all are 4 or 5 stars. When I do find a review that pans this book I have to wonder about the commentator. Either they wrote the review for the wrong book or they should pack up their computer and take it back to the store. Castro makes HTML so simple.I can't wait to start another book from Elizabeth Castro."
5,Fantastic! Easiest book to learn HTML from,This book can turn a complete novice into a person who can write great web pages in a day. It is very easy to follow and gives you visual examples every step of the way.
4,Great reference,"I am a college student studying Web Design, and I keep this book close by during all my HTML classes. It's an excellent companion to our textbooks, and this book is sometimes easier to understand and follow. The index is great, it makes it so easy to find whatever topic you need. And the greatest part is that you don't have to read a lot, most of the topics have just one or two pages with illustrations and extra tips. I've been teaching my husband HTML as I learn it, and he refers to this book a lot too, because it's so easy to get used to, even for beginners. One of the best books on my shelf."
4,Great Reference!,"As an HTML beginner/intermediate learner, this book is a great source of reference. It's not exactly the kind of book you'll sit down and read from cover to cover, but using it to look up a particular subject is perfect. It has great explainations and examples."
5,A great book for the novice and pro!,A great book. It has answered alot of questions for me in my quest to get better at HTML coding. Check outmy site at to see what it has allowed me to do! I highly recommend this book! A great learning tool! END
5,Covers all the bases.,"This book takes you step by step through the core essentials of HTML. The syntax highlighting acts as a quick reference guide and, all the extras at the back makes the book complete. This is a very good book!"
4,An excellent resource.,"HTML 4 for the World Wide Web: Visual QuickStart Guide by Elizabeth Castro is an excellent resource with detailed descriptions of most tags in the W3C HTML 4.0 suggested standard. Includes many helpful tables with everything from which elements work in which browsers, colour names and numbers, special character numbers, javascript and vbscript commands."
5,An excellent book,I enjoyed reading this book. It provided concise and easily understandable instructions. The use of illustrations was also very helpful. It is an excellent book for beginners.
5,wonderful wonderful wonderful,after i wanna start to learn html i only read the articles about this book in amazon.com. i really did not read the book. but i was affected by the ideas of the customers. read it and try the exitement of this book. have nice time with it.
2,Slanted For McIntosh Users! Too briefly summarized a view.,"On the basis of all these rave reviews and the book's status as bestseller, I spent my hard-earned money on two of Elizabeth Castro's books including this one and her book on Perl and CGI. What a huge mistake! I wanted a printed reference for quick referral when coding HTML. This book is definitely NOT it. Ms. Castro is somewhat more generous to Mac owners with her information. My machine is an IBM running Windows 98. From my point of view Castro's books are poorly organized, poorly presented, misrepresented, and incomplete. I learned far more in far less time from free tutorials on the web. I recommend a trip to(where Que and SAMS computer books are electronically published and readable in their entirety for FREE). I wish I had saved my money for something better. Buyer beware!"
5,Easiest Computer Book I've ever Read,"Her style is simple and extremely well laid-out. Presents the material in an easy to understand fashion. I've only read a couple of computer books and have done some web-design before this, and this book is Perfect for the beginner/intermeidate. HIGHLY Recommended."
4,A great helper for beginning and advanced HTML users.,"This book is easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to follow. Step-by-step instructions for the newest version of HTML, and even has a huge section on style sheets. Easy reading and very helpful in creating my web pages."
4,Your Quest to learn HTML should begin with this book!,"I devoured the previous edition and the new stuff contained in this latest edition. It's a great reference book as well as an excellent tutorial. I've been a sales mgr. for Sybex, Microsoft Press and Osborne/McGraw-Hill computer books and I just recently discovered this series. These books are far better than the ones I used to sell (can I have a job, PeachPit Press?:))"
5,I agree - it's the best!,"This book didn't get 4 1/2 stars out of 5 for no reason. It's simply the best book on HTML out there (and I've perused a dozen or so!)The Visual QuickStart Series is a very good one to begin with but Elizabeth Castro simply makes it better. Her information is complete, concise and easy to follow.I get upset when my 19 year old son borrows (and then hides) this book from me. I try to use other books for basic reference info but they simply don't compare to Castro's. (Guess I'll have to get him his own copy)I too lament the fact that 5 stars is the highest rating that I can give this book!"
2,Whats the big deal? It isnt that great!,"It is not that wonderful, there are plenty of other great books out there that cover much much more advanced topics. there are no pratical exercises to do, all you do is type in what she(the author) already did. That is no way to learn HTML!"
5,This IS a five star book.,"The best HTML reference book out there. I've used this version and the previous version and you just can't beat it. This book explains and illustrates each HTML command and how to use them.I was suprised to see a few people had given this book a poor rating. My guess is that they may have expected this book to show them how to build their web site. It won't tell you how to get internet access, how to design your pages, what content you should use on your page, how to upload your code, when you should maintain your page, etc. It strictly explains HTML programming, and does a great job of it!!"
2,It's OK,"All books on this subject fall short. At least this one has a reasonable price. After looking through this book for answers, I'm still stuck on what I need to do. ???"
5,Examples are great!,"I am a college student starting a computer business, and HTML is something I'm going to need to know. I learn best by example, and when I went to the bookstore, I saw that this book had examples. So I picked it up. I haven't finished it yet, but boy are the examples helpful! I greatly recommend this book to all learners, whether by example or not."
4,Glad I chose this book....,"I've bought alot of books covering many different languages\ technologies that use ""quick,easy,fast,simple,"" or the like to describe the approach used in their books. Very few live up to their claims. Elizabeth Castro has done a very good job presenting the material in an effective and entertaining manner. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was her continual use of tags that weren't explained until later in the book. That being the only complaint, I also bought her XML book."
5,"HTML 4 for the World Wide Web, Fourth Edition","About 10 years or so ago when I wanted to make my own website I bought HTML 3 for the World Wide Web, third edition, and having no former experience in making a website with html language I soon had a couple of websites up on the internet.When I saw this 4th edition of HTML for the World Wide Web on Amazon.com I bought it and I am happy with my purchase. The author Elizabeth Castro gives easy to understand instructions along with photos to help you out. Both editions 3 and 4 that I own have been invaluable to me in making my own websites and learning the in's and out's of html language."
5,Easy to understand and follow instructions.,"Having no HTML experience, this book was recommended by our Manager of I.T.S. The detailed instruction and illustrations made it easy to understand and create my first website."
3,Too many cats spoil the book,Should be called The Catlover's Visual QuickStart Guide. The many cutesy examples involving cats made me want to fwow up an HTML ball. I've filed a complaint with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Humans.
3,Functional but a bit uncomfortable,"I bought these headphones 3 years ago at a retail store. I originally bought them to use with my Archos player, but have used them with my laptop (via Bluetooth & dongle), Cellphone (Bluetooth), and now my little brother uses them on his PS3 (Bluetooth). I also agree with the other post that the dongle is awkward, I fixed it to my Archos player with a piece of stick on Velcro from a fabric store and that worked great. Battery life has been epic, I've been using them pretty frequently since I bought them and sometimes would quit using them without turning them off overnight and they were still good to go the next day without a charge. I do like the spliter for the charging cable which let you charge one or both of the components. I also agree they are a might uncomfortable, and will pain my ears if worn for extended periods of time. Great product electronic wise, fit could be much improved."
2,Ouch!,"Bought these as a replacement for my Logitech Bluetooth Headphones that broke after just 2 months. Typical of Logitech products, but that's another story.As for these headphones, well, the best I can say is they work. They are quite possibly the most uncomfortable pair of headphones I have every worn. Poor fit and hard plastic DO NOT go hand in hand. I can maybe get in a whole 15 minutes of wearing these things before I have to start finding other ways to position them over my ears. They actually hurt to wear. They also make you look like you are wearing a couple of little donuts on your ears. Somebody really needs to come out with some flexible and stylish behind the neck wireless headphones......and soon.Also, the little dongle is awkward, but then why wouldn't it be...just sort of hanging there.Not impressed!"
5,LOVE PRODUCT,"Great product, I bought this one for back up for other that I have for almost 5 years work great"
3,It's really for Windows DNA beginner,This book is for beginner who wanted to know what does MS Tech covers under the Windows DNA roof. It really covers all the technical terms and their purpose of each technology available in Windows DNA Architecture. It is really good for IT managers who wanted to understand what technologies available from MS platform but if you are a developer then this book might not be helpful cause it doesn't provide enough technical info especially in the building section of this book.
4,Good Management,"Programmer geeks won't like this book because it's not full of code and nauseating technical detail, but if you're a PM, VP, or CIO and moving your company's technology into the Microsoft Solution Space, this book is a great jump-start. It's an easy read (I read the bulk of it on a cross country flight) and provides a pretty complete high-level view of all the Microsoft piece-parts. Overall, I'd call this a book that needed to be written.Joe@ASPGurus.com"
2,This is a very simple book,If you have a computer degree and if you are not new to computer programming then this book is not for you. Anybody who has have experienced with any microsoft technologies before reading this book will find it extremely useless. Its a lot better to go through the books of windows architecture then this book. Those books will give you real insight but this book won't.
4,The straight scoop on modern writers,"This book does what it sets out to do and then some. Filled with bits and pieces about your favorite authors, and even your not-so-favorites. Written in a reference type style, it zips right along from Attwood to Bukowski to Rushdie. Imminently readable and filled with astute observations, tongue-in-cheek humor, and wonderful nuggets of insider scoop, this reader's guide is a valuable resource for any bibliophile. Two snaps up!"
3,Oh Please!,"Please please please! A quick scan in the bookstore reveals all sparkly smugness (is that a Salon specialty?)-- and a literary roundup that somehow ignores--Donald Westlake (Richard Stark): Does crime writing get any better?Mark Richard: the real Southern GothicSusan Minot: Wasp SoulBarry Yourgrau: genuinely unique imagination-- No W.G. Sebald!--- No Alex Garland!I would say this is not so much an ""opinionated"" guide as an annoyingly incomplete one-- and that the guiders could use a little counselling in their subject."
2,Be Warned.....,"This ""guide to contemporary authors"" is really a guide to ""Salon-approved"" authors. You should be aware that this book is actually more of a collection of critiques, as opposed to a ""guide"" to contemporary authors. Sum it up? It's what you would expect from Salon: white, male heterosexuals need not apply. If you are white, it's best you be female; if you are male, it's best you be gay; if you write and want to be reviewed favorably in the 2nd edition, it's best you make clear your political sentiments (so Salon will know what to write about you). Harsh? Maybe. True? Undeniable. My suggestion: forget this ""guide"" to contemporary authors and read a few and write your own - it has to be better than this collection of political and social commentaries."
1,Is Richard Ford really a Massachusetts boy?,"It is troubling to buy a book like this, look up the author Richard Ford, and find that he was supposedly born in Jackson, Massachusetts. How good is the rest of the information in the book?"
5,"Rabid Readers, Buy This Book!","This is a book to devour. I certainly did so, several times over. How many times do you visit the fiction section and see names and names of authors on the spine and wonder what they're like? Especially contemporary authors that haven't established a worldwide reputation like say Faulkner yet? You don't have time to sample them all randomly. Then this book comes along, and in it are about 100 such contemporary authors, all about them, what they wrote, which book to start with first. And you devour it. And you send copies to all your best reading comrades, so they can share the love. This is a really good book. And the way these reviewers chose the authors is based on who they loved, not some college canon or the like. I don't know of any comparable book anywhere. I ended up indulging in a lot of new authors and new books and some I didn't care for, naturally, and some I adored."
5,GREAT!!,I just got this CD and I love it!! What a great new talent. I have listened to it few times and it is already one of my favorites. I would strongly recommend this CD!!
4,It Grows on you,"I originally bought this CD because of Save Tonight, and didn't find the other songs all that great. But after listening to the others a couple of times, they kinda start to grow on you!"
1,Skip it.,"One of your reviewers below notes that this guy has potential. People identified as having potential are generally those who haven't done anything yet. Therefore, I agree. ""Save Tonight"" is a stupid song delivered in monotone and everthing else is worse. For good current music, see Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan or Carlos Santana. I liked no songs on this album so I give it zero stars even though it shows up as 1 star above. I save 1-star ratings for really bad albums that have a single hit on them like ""Sgt. Pepper""."
5,YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ONE!!...BELIEVE ME YOU WON'T REGRET IT!,"THE FIRST TIME I HEARD SAVE TONIGHT ON THE RADIO..... I THOUGHT , THAT SONG ROCKS.....AND THE ARTIST HAS A GREAT VOICE! ...... WELL, I FOUND THE OTHER SONGS TO BE A BLAST TOO!!"
5,An amazing and deeply meaningful album.,"I loved ""Save Tonight"" from the first time I heard it, and it was the first of many fantastic songs."
3,Desirable.,"Most people have heard the track ""Save Tonight"" from this, and it is probably the best and most upbeat song. However the rest is decent, it's kind of lightweight folk/soul/pop, but still enjoyable. He's kind of like a less-deep ""Cat Stevens"", and a much less-sexy ""Maxwell"", somwhere in the middle anyway. After the ""hit"", I like ""Shooting Up In Vain"", and ""When Mermaids Cry"" is catchy, otherwise some of the rest is forgettable. At the very least he left us with one great track, kind of like his sister ""Neneh"" did many years ago (Buffalo Stance)."
5,One of my favorite CD's,"I bought this out of curiosity because someone I knew owned it and it turned out to be one of my favorite CD's. Strong throughout but ""When Mermaids Cry"" is the clear winner. Haunting."
2,Boo,"A cheap rip off of Ben Harper, also known as God. Eagle-Eye cruised onto the Billboard charts on his father's last name. His musical talent is very minimal. If you read the album credits, he doesn't even play lead guitar on most of his songs. I'll give him credit for writing an annoyingly catchy hook for ""Save Tonight,"" but even that was pretty uncreative. Eagle-Eye should stick to acting."
2,"Ho, Hum.","Not the mot memorable CD I've purchased. In fact, it's rather disappointing. ""Save Tonight"" was an excellent single and the rest of the album was light years behind it. I hope the airwaves aren't poisoned by any other songs from this ""desireless"" album."
2,Save Tonight is one of the only songs worth hearing,"""Save Tonight"" is a great song but the rest of the album is lacking in creativity and excitement. If thats the only song you like on this album do not buy it.If you are into slower music like Jewel then you might like this Cd."
5,"""SAVE"" your money!!!!!","""Save Tonight"" was good, but don't waste your money like I did on the entire CD. After the first song he gets real sappy."
4,MODERATELY INTERESTING,"No new ground broken here.....but not a bad first effort. I particularly enjoyed the title track. I appreciate this CD most as background music....a little mellow, a little jazzy, a little funky.I'll keep an ""eagle eye"" open for a follow-up record. This kid has potential."
4,Mellow rock,"Eagle-Eye Cherry's platinum debut CD will be remembered primarily for the hit ""Save Tonight"" and his odd-sounding name, but it really is a terrific CD overall. It's the type of CD that I don't listen to often but impresses when I slip it into my stereo. Like ""Save Tonight,"" most of the songs are mid-rock and mellow sounding, almost jazzy at times. None of the other songs really stand out as could-a-been hits because this CD is best listened to as a whole. The CD also ends beautifully with a cover of ""Desireless,"" which was written by Eagle-Eye's father. Eagle-Eye wrote and co-produced most of the album, and he really is a major talent. Too bad Eagle-Eye's most recent CD didn't keep him in the spotlight, where he deserves to be."
1,Really Bad,"I didn't like this album. It was one of those busts you buy because of a hit song but the whole cd is horrible. The only good song is Save Tonight. The rest are slow pop songs while Save Tonight is a faster rock song. If you're considering buying this choose something else or if you've heard this album and like it a lot, buy it."
2,Don't waste your money!!!,"I loved the song ""Save Tonight"" when I heard it on the radio. Then it popped up everywhere like shows like Felicity and Dawson's Creek. So I borrowed it from a friend and expected more great songs. It was such a let down! I'm glad I didn't waste my money and you shouldn't either. And for his skills as a musician they are minimal."
2,DULL!,The only song on this CD worth listening to is Save Tonight and that song is as old as dirt thanks radio overplay.
5,Great help!!,I bought this book for a guide to improve my writing skills for work as well as my module assignments.
3,Keys to a Great Beginning,"This is a good book for Writer's Workshop I am taking. I feel, I will benefit off this book. I think, it was a great purchase."
5,great extension,Works great. A little stiff to push in but it stays once you get it in there. No problems. The coil cord makes it very easy to store but it also reduces the actual length. For me all I needed was a few feet of extension so it is perfect.
4,Works great and won't go camping without it!,"This extension works great. It collapses nicely so it can be stored in my vehicle. My only complaint is that the coils are pretty stiff so getting the actual 10' extension is not possible. To achieve a 10' extension a fair amount of force would be required to stretch it, but the required force usually results in the cable getting unplugged from the adapter. Either way, the extension cord works great and provides enough length to easily work with all items outside of my vehicle."
4,"very good, to those with open musical tastes","This is NOT your typical tribute album. For this reason it is often times excels ( the Cure's cover, Jeff Beck/ Seal cover)and other times I didn't find it particularly interesting. But what this album does that most don't is allow a large array of musical styles to pay tribute to one of the most influential rock musicians ever. That's the beauty of Jimi's music, not only was he an excellent and creative guitarist, but he made great music and wrote timeless songs (check out two completely different covers of ""Little Wing"" by Stevie Ray Vaughn and Sting, respectively).To the typical purists and guitar nuts, this is NOT your album.To those who can appreciate varying types of music and appreciate that Hendrix' music can be interpreted and presented in so many different ways - this is a really nice effort and a nice tribute to a great musician."
3,"Some good, some bad, some generic","I agree with a lot of what has been written about this album. At 43 cents you are getting a bargain. Clapton does sound mailed in; Nigel Kennedy, well lets not get too personal; Buddy Guys, great guitar work but I have never been a fan of his vocals (that is just a personal feeling, if you like his vocals then you will like this song). With that being said, there are some versions which I love and for that go out and buy the album. Chrissie Hynde's version of Axis is fabulous, MACC adds soul to an already great song, Belly has taken a throwaway and has created something special. Overall it is 3 out of 5. The highs are great but the lows (EC you know you could have done better) are generic, which is probably the worst thing you can ever say about a classic artist - especially one that you revere."
1,Some good parts,"This disc has some good moments but my question is: Why did they let Slash destroy Hendrix's legacy. After hearing him butcher one of Jimi's tunes I can no longer listen to Hendrix. Slash's ear splitting playing has ruined it for me, and I used to really enjoy it."
1,This is terrible!,"The Cure? Doing Hendrix? Come on. Who's the genius who came up with the lineup for this one? Claptan, Beck, and Buddy Guy are great musicians and are a no brainer to be on a Hendrix Tribute. Then they throw in PM Dawn!! Blasphemy! The Spin Docters, wow, they are a terrible band to start out with. There are a few good tunes on this cd, but for the most part it is a waste of time and money and a terrible tribute to a legend. I've spoken."
4,"A good, interesting, entertaining Tribute Album","Stone Free / a tribute to Jimi Hendrix: While I have little interest in Tribute albums, I bought this one for the Eric Clapton performance I heard on the radio. To my surprise, this turned out to be a very entertaining album. It's far from perfect. Some of the performances are better than others (which is the nature of a various artist tribute album) but the good ones outnumber the bad by a good margin. I have come to like this album very much. This is a four star album."
4,Variety? Spice of Hendrix tribute...,"I'm a big fan of Hendrix, and so I was interested in hearing his work, and how it would be interpreted by such diverse artists as the Cure, Slash, Soundgarden/Pearl Jam, Clapton, and Ice-T's Body Count. I was extremely satisfied... the Cure, Ice-T, Slash and Paul Rodgers, Seal and Jeff Beck, and Buddy Guy had the highlights of the album, IMO. I'd buy the album for those five songs alone... not to say that the other songs are c**p... the only two I really skip are the ones by Belly and the Pretenders, and they aren't bad at all. Hendrix was all about expanding the boundaries of the guitar, and this album does well in that vein, allowing lots of different artists (Nile Rodgers working with Clapton? Seal working with Jeff Beck!?) to add their own flavor to pre-existing tunes. Highly recommended."
3,Spotty Brilliance,"Most tribute albums leave a lot to be desired and this one is not much different; however, the price of the whole CD is worth it if for nothing other than M.A.C.C.'s ""Hey Baby (Land of the New Rising Sun)"" and the Jeff Beck/Seal treatment of ""Manic Depression."" There are a couple of other decent covers, but on the whole Slash, Paul Rogers, The Cure and others ruin what could have been one of the few acceptable tribute albums."
2,Inconsistent Novelty Item,"I realize it is not popular to criticize anything related to the Church of Hendrix, but this collection of tunes ranges from clever engaged covers by the Cure and Living Color, to phoned-in, tepid playing by Clapton and Metheny. A few other cuts are OK, including ""I Don't Live Today"" with Slash and Paul Rodgers, but then we have Belly blathering through ""Are You Experienced"" and Jeff Beck sounding overcaffeinated on ""Manic Depression.""One more thing: notice that the used price for this CD now starts at less than a dollar (it was around $1.99 when I first wrote this review). I would suggest you stay in this price range. I wasted a perfectly good gift certificate on this recording."
2,Stone Free: THE WORST TRIBUTE,Their has been many jimi hendrix tributes since jimi hendrix's death. This one truely sucks all the bands cant compare to jimi hendrix exept eric claptons:stone free and jeff becks:manic depression. The sound quality sucks also thats another downfall. If your waiting for a great tribute in may experience hendrix will be releasing a jimi hendrix tribute with bands like lenny kravits and more. Dont waste your time on this one thank you very much for reading this and make sure you check out my other reviews. Was This Review Helpful?
3,Odd line up,"A strange tribute to the great Jimi Hendrix. There are simply not enough guitar players featured here ... which seems odd, no? However, Jeff Beck's playing on Manic Depression is worth the price of the album. He is someone that can play the guitar in the same free spirit as Jimi Hendrix, he is a true artist that, like Hendrix, follows his heart and not the corporate mentality. Too bad much of this album is not like that."
3,Reads Like A Fanzine,"Occasionally useful as a checklist of obscure English-language sources, but often let down by amateurish slips, the Asian Horror Encyclopedia lacks both an editor prepared to stay the author's outbreaks of fanboy gush and unsupported speculation, as well as a proof-reader who could have corrected the many, many errors. Without an index, it is less obvious that many words are spelt differently each time they occur; though this is a book for English speakers, its usefulness to someone who cannot check the primary sources is severely limited. Seemingly scooping up any information to hand without much sense of its quality, Bush's work reads more like a series of notes than a book in its own right. Researchers in Asian literature may stumble across occasional crumbs of interesting information, but will need to find help elsewhere in digesting them."
3,Flawed but interesting,"Typos and amateurish enthusiasm flaw this book, but it has a lot of interesting information. A quick check of the Library of Congress shows that this is indeed the only book on Asian, Japanese or Chinese Horror in English. No one else has tried to look at Asian horror as a whole, a huge subject entirely unknown in the West. It has hundreds of entries on subjects as diverse as haunted bridges, Kabuki ghost plays, Oiwa, Asian psychics, Kwaidan, Hearn, Ikiryo, biological horrors, Liaozhai, Yuen Mai, The Ring, etc. It tries to cover too much, but what it does do is fascinating. For example, magical paintings appear to be an entire subgenre in Asian literature. Though the bibliography is hardly exhaustive, it is sufficiently long (10 pages) and its breadth shows that the author did substantiate his work."
2,Bigger is not better!,"I realized after the skillet arrived that I had overestimated it's size. It is far too big for my purposes, and doesn't fit on my stove top. I have put it in the mail as a return. It was my mistake in selecting something that size. Probably it would be wonderful for a large family or even a restaurant, but not for my purposes. Sorry!"
3,I've had better...,"The skillet is 14 inches, but the bottom of the pan is no larger than my 12 inch skillet. It's deep, but it is not a wide pan and that's what I was looking for. The outside is brushed metal and is not as nice looking as some other skillets. Not really suitable to hang on my pot rack with my other non-stick pans. The handle is useful."
2,Not impressed,"We bought this pan about a year and a half ago as we are a family of four and needed a big skillet. After about a year of medium to light usage (once or twice a week) it was no longer non-stick and the pan was warped. It no longer lays flat on a cooking surface and no matter how much Pam or oil we used, the food would stick. For care, we never put it in the washer or used hard utensils that would scratch or wear away the non-stick. We washed it by hand and took good care of it. We finally had to throw it away this weekend. Now the search begins for something better."
3,"Too synthetic, good for principiants!","This guide is useful only on a basic base because it reports a lot of infos over this consulting firm but with lower value than the site guide:what are the pros and cons of working for them, how Mercer compared to McKinsey and The Boston Consulting Group.... My advice is to read the last two books written by Mercer, that's ""Value Nets"" and ""Profit Patterns"": they are very helpful because they bring a lot of real cases developing a smart mind on the reader."
4,what is a sister to do?,Growing up Eve always asked her parent for a brother or sister. When her mom finally had a baby it turned out to be twins! The twins are now 4 years old and always wanting to around Eve and be like her. She has really had it with her sister. The plot thickens when her family decides to attend a twin festival. Read Big Trouble in Little Twinsville to find out what trouble the twins cause for Eve at the festival!The book is good for readers who are just starting to read chapter books. Children who have younger siblings will be able to relate well to the challenges that Eve faces with her sisters.Children who have younger siblings will be able to relate well to the challenges that Eve faces with her sisters.
1,Surprised at all the five stars,"Normally I love Anne George's books about two Southern Sisters, but this one just seemed to drag along endlessy for no real reason. There's pages and pages of trips up and down Chandler Mountain, information about Snake Handling, e-mails back and forth to too-perfect daughter Haley, irrelevant visits from irrelevant charachers (for instance, all the stuff about Debbie and her new baby and a visit from a cop who is nice but who is completely ungermaine to the story), too many pointless nights spent with an afghan on the couch, and lots of flirting with a Sheriff who is doing absolutely nothing to solve this murder. The murderer isn't even introduced until way too late in the story and there are no clues, hints, etc. pointing his way until he actually IS introduced and even then, it's real vague. Too much fluff and not enough substance to keep this reader entertained. A disappointment from Anne George."
4,I carry a torch for Anne George's Southern Sisters.,"The Southern Sisters series is one of the best! Overall, it's a consistent series...funny, well written, excellently plotted, with interesting background detail. ""Murder Carries a Torch"" is no exception to that generalization: in fact, this novel may be the best of the series so far. It seems easier, somehow: not so contrived and outrageous. But then again, anything with Mouse, Aunt Sister, a dumb cop, and a bunch of religious snake-handlers is going to be a LITTLE outrageous.Sit back and enjoy it!"
4,The Chill Zone v2,"This compilation is the perfect accompaniment to your evening or afternoon if you are a supreme being of leisure. Or if you desire to become one, this compilation will put you well on your way. Lucious textures of sound wash through these songs with very subtle groovy beats and seductive overtones. Chill or read a book, cuddle with your lover or just be. This is a solid comp. Features ""Ocean Beat"" by Tosca (with Richard Dorfmeister from the infamous German duo Kruder&Dorfmeister) from their latest album 'Suzuki."" Another personal favorite of mine on this CD is ""Free"" by K & K. You won't be dissapointed."
1,A real disappointment,"What a great idea... gathering the collective thoughts and wisdom of fifty women who have reached fifty and beyond. Unfortunately, Bonnie Miller Rubin missed the mark and has gathered together a collection of bland, simplistic and superficial statements from fifty celebrities including Suzanne Somers and Tammy Faye Bakker.Open any page and you'll see what I mean... ""Another thing I've learned is you have to pay attention to what's authentic."" ""When you're going through a really tough time, you need to have good women friends."" ""Plastic surgery is certainly a big topic for all of us girls out there over forty, isn't it?"" ""I learned that I can't do anything about the length of my life, but I can do something about its width and its depth."" ""Change keeps you young.""Don't waste your money, buy this book instead: ""On Women Turning 50: Celebrating Mid-Life Discoveries,"" interviews and photography by Cathleen Rountree."
4,Excellent Product,"This was ordered as a gift for my brother-in-law, an attorney. We wanted a pen that looked well made and had a quality design. This one fit the bill at a very reasonable price. It looks as good as far more expensive fountain pens. Although it does not have the cachet of a Mont Blanc, or other ""boutique"" pen, it works just as well, and looks great. Delivery was timely."
4,Used for my journaling.,"I love the feel and the smooth flow of ink, but I am a little dissapointed that I seem to need to unscrew the pen during my daily three page journaling to adjust the ink in the refillable cartidge."
5,Excellent and Important Book,"I read the original edition of this book decades ago, and found it very valuable. It puts raw food eating in the context of spiritual life, although certainly not to the detriment of good science. Dr. Cousens is a physician whose in depth research, personal experience, and now decades of work guiding others, inform a very well written, readable book with lots more information than you might expect on the subject. It is a great step simply to steer toward vegetarian diet and an increased percentage of raw foods, and many books offer guidance in this direction. But this book goes far beyond that. The new edition is a great improvement on the first, and as I read it (just got it recently) I keep re-discovering things from my first introduction to this kind of eating and life style, and more good stuff to help a person both decide whether to pursue this direction and how to manage the personal pitfalls and challenges involved."
1,Would not recommend,If you are just beginning to learn about raw food or living food - leave this book on the shelf for a few years. It's long. It's boring. It's in depth. It reads a like a text book.
5,Gabriel Cousens is a genious,This is one of the most informative books I have read on nutrition. It will be one of my go to books forever.
4,Conscious Eating,Coussens has done a remarkable job of detailing the value of going vegan and going raw. The book is designed to help the person on a S(tandard) A(merican) D(iet) understand the value of switching to a raw diet. The book is a hefty read but value information that is in one place.
4,engaging intellectual history,"A very interesting history of American law, useful for those about to enter the legal profession or enroll in law school, or anyone wishing to learn more about the history of ideas in law."
3,Notes for a Longer Book,"I don't know why The Ages of American Law is regarded as a classic of American legal history. It's clearly written but tries to cover way too much ground in a very short space (111 pages of text with large print and big margins). Based on a series of lectures, The Ages of American Law strings together short observations on legal topics ranging from Lord Mansfield to the development of the Uniform Commercial Code. No subject is developed in depth: at best, the ""book"" is notes for a real book. One of my professors at law school used to rave about this book. It must have been because he's mentioned favorably in an endnote."
5,Totally F@$#ing Sick!!!,"Blood, violence, no 'bs' storylines to sit through. What else could a deathmatch fan want? Eric Gargulo and John House (the Indie version of the WWE's JR and the King) provide intro and comentary to an epic of Roman Proportions!From Nick Mondo, the Wifebeater, and Mad Man Pondo to John Zandig, and the weedwhacker shots, this is totally insane.I believe this is where ECW was headed before its demise. If you like the insane bumps in ECW, then do yourself a favor and pick this up."
5,Well worth it's usages,"This is a pretty good Inverter. I've used this type of Inverter for I'm sure about 8 years. My old one played on out, so I have happy to upgrade to this VEC053D! Highly recommend"
4,Good Key,"This is a nice handcuff key however mine does not look like the picture. Instead of being a gloss nickel coating, mine is a flat gray metallic coating with black tips and shirt clip. Still a completely functioning and durable key, just not as pictured."
3,passable juicer with some drawbacks,"This juicer does work...and the juice it produces does taste better than store bought; however it is hardly 'whisper quiet'. It also takes a while to clean the strainer part of the machine, use a toothbrush. I can't speak to its durability as I haven't used it very long, but i've juiced a variety of friuts and vegetables. You are left with ALOT of pulp no matter which type of fruit and vegetables you use; and it is wet...NOT DRY.I wonder how hard the motor is working...since it seemed to get louder after I juiced for a while...I would guess it's prone to burn out because the motor is working too hard. I recommend cleaning after each use- especially if you are going to use it on a daily basis. Will update this review with a note about how long the juicer lasts. If you've never juiced before...it takes alot of fruit and/or vegetables to make an 8 ounce glass. For example 6 carrots and 2 cored sliced apples makes one glass of juice. Hope this helps."
4,Great juicer,"I love this product. It runs smoothly without too much noise. Easy to clean. Nice look. Though the pulp is not perfectly dry, it is a great juicer."
5,Nutrisource 2000 Juicer review:,"I have owned this juicer for almost ten years. It is a great product. Does what it says it does. Clean up can be fairly easy, but is messy. I still have all of the original parts. And I keep the screen very clean. Also need to cut up larger items that do not fit down the chute. I use a walmart bag on the back of it to catch the pulp because then you just have to throw the bag away instead of clean up the pulp catcher. Just make sure there are no holes in the bag, otherwise there are carrot shreds where you never thought there would be any. If you want a large glass of something just put it on a phone book or two. The motor is very adequate and somewhat loud. Stores easy. I have not used the mill or liquid accessories yet, but I may be doing that soon. All and all a product I cannot do without."
1,Bad Buy,The Brachs Wintergreen Lozenges tasted nothing like wintergreen and were actually rather foul. Better to spend the money on Necco Company's Canada Wintergreen Lozenges.
1,Very little taste,BRACH'S WINTERGREEN LOZENGES HAS VERY LITTLE TASTE. IT DOES NOT TASTE AT ALL LIKE CANADA'S LOZENGES.I AM SO SORRY I BOUGHT THEM. THE PACKAGE ARRIVE IN GOOD CONDITION.M.SWOPE FROM FLORIDA
1,Worthless junk,"Worked well first 3 times. On the 4th broke (goes in reverse, but not forward). Turns out 5 weeks old and already out of warranty. I never heard of 1 months warranty on new products before. Found stories of people shipping defective products to them at great expense ($20+) and never getting anything or even hearing back."
1,Sad disappointment,"Bought this product in May 2010. My sister and I went together to purchase it in preparation for grinding our own meat. Never got around to using it until January of this year. It had never been used. Read the manual, assembled it according to instructions. Ran it exactly 30 minutes - it seized up. Cleaned it out, disassembling all parts as per instructions in the manual, reassembled. Never worked again. The gears won't even turn.Warranty? Worthless. Durability - none. Read other reviews - this grinder used to be made in the U.S.A. and those models are still going strong. The new ones are made in China. I should have known what I was getting into.Wouldn't recommend this product to my worst enemy."
1,"Shoddy quality, broke really fast.","I got this meat grinder as a gift; the first thing it did chew a big gouge in the blade and plates -- they were non-flat out of the box. A quick trip to the sharpener flattened things out acceptably (note that I haven't seen another source for these plates). Then, on my third batch of sausage, the on/off switch broke. Of course, it's a completely custom part and replacements are not available.If I'm super lucky, the superglue will hold and I'll finish this batch and get another product."
1,Back to Basics Grinder 4500,"Beware Back to Basics. The on/off switch on our 4500 grinder broke this morning (cheesy design). When I called the company for a replacement switch, I was told that they don't sell parts for the internals of the machine; If the guts go bad, just throw it away. Fine way to do business."
2,grinder parts,"mine lasted a couple years but when it broke down I tried to get replacement parts...""liability issue, NO parts available""Buy American!!!!!"
3,Another bum steer,"Red frequently provokes passionate responses to his passionate and quite inventive solos. But this isn't the 1957 album, ""Ride Red Ride in Hi Fi,"" that receives many of those accolades. Instead it's a history covering Red's career from the 20s through much of the 40s. Be prepared for a lot of banjo and not a lot of bass. And before ordering, be sure you know it's the recording you're looking for."
4,great stuff,I've been using this stuff for a week and wow what a difference in my hair. If your hair needs help get this!!! Or even if you just want to keep your hair beautiful this will help also.
4,Great journal!,"This is a great hardcover journal and the embossing is very well done! The pages are sturdy and the binding is excellent, I just wish there were more of them!"
4,Great book!!,"This book kept my attention from the very first page. I had difficulty putting it down and read it all in two sessions. The characters seemed very real. The suspense kept me interested and wanting to see what happened next, especially since it was based on a true story. I look forward to Mr. Ramsey's next book."
1,Bodies is a Void,"Bodies in the Bay was a very disappointing read. There was no suspense and the banal plot line just went on and on. The story is much more appropriate for a feature story in Time magazine (10 pages with a few gory pictures) There was nothing morally, artistically or intellectually redeeming about this book. Left me empty and mad I spent time and money on this. The many typos in the book simply (i.e. too for to and he'll for hell) added to the annoyance!"
5,Bodies in the Bay,I could not put down this book until the end. The story captures and shocks you. Knowing the events are based on real situations only increases the interest from page to page.
5,Best Taffy Candy Ever!,"I lived in Japan from 2001 - 2003, and used to eat these things by the bagful! They are similar in taste to Mambas, but much more realistically flavored, with the grape and strawberry being especially good, and the yogurt being the best of all. What really clinches their deliciousness is their chewability, which is almost like a taffy/gum. I'm not sure of a better way of putting it, but it's definitely one of a kind...My favorite way to eat them was to eat half of a yogurt piece with half of a fruit piece. The result = candy heaven!I used to get Hi-Chews with small packs of hard sour gummies (can't remember the name) and go to town. Besides those two candies I really prefer U.S. stuff, but oh boy, are those two good! ;^)"
5,Modern and timely instructional work,"Where Page's book has dated and become near irrelevant, this takes up. It is not for the so-called ""common"" shooter, it is for those shooters who aspire to be the best possible precision rifle shooter. Critisize the writing style? Ridiculous! How can a shooter who takes one cartridge deer hunting if he has but one deer tag be maligned for not meeting the needs of the ""common"" shooter?"
2,A defnite but incomplete guide to the common shooter,This is abook that defines the ABCD's bt eventually not in the ABCD's of the common shooter.A guide to the known is a much better put sentence!
3,DATED.,"Its like sitting next to an old man who wont stop telling you old war stories or keeps nagging on about how much better it was ""back in the day""... But if you listen hard enough and dont get bored with the flashbacks, you can pick out bits and pieces of usefull information. Worth buying if under $6."
5,A Great guide to Accurate Shooting,Although Tony's book is about Benchrest shooting the information is usefull for anyone who wants to shoot more accurately. A new shooter or an old timer can learn something from this book. Tony's view on shooting do not incorporate all the aspects but he clearly states there are other opinions.This book has been long overdue and I was not disapointed.
3,"Decent overall, but no Warren Page's ""The Accurate Rifle""","It's worth the price, but definitely not in the same class as Warren Page's ""The Accurate Rifle"". Get a copy of Page's book first. Newick's writing style, in this book at least, leaves a lot to be desired."
3,This book is ideal for bench top shooting enthusiasts.,I was looking for a more general all around rifle technique book. There are many excellent points provided of which most are applicable anywhere. This book will let you know what it takes to be the best of the best when it comes to shooting a rifle. It may not have been exactly what I was looking for but for the price I am glad to have it and it was very well written.
4,"Typical delightful, quirky Van Dyke Parks collection","Catchy tunes, with sometimes weird lyrics that don't necessarily make that much sense other than fitting the beats in the songs, just like a lot of other VDP songs. A breath of fresh air compared to so much of what's out there, with much more interesting orchestration that usual. This is one that I listen to every so often. I especially like Movies Is Magic."
4,Wilson and Parks make magic again!!,"After deliberating this purchase, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. There are several really catchy songs on here that make this album worth a purchase - Orange Crate Art, Sail Away and Wings of a Dove. The others are average to mediocre but very listenable. The album seems to be an ode to California - it's weather, atmosphere, and history. Recommended for fans of the Wislon and Parks style of music - pleasant and timeless. You will play it again and again...Also, don't miss a GREAT performance of Wilson doing Orange Crate Art accompanied ONLY by Van Dyke on piano on the 'I Just Wasnn't Made For These Times' DVD - located at the very end of chapter 18. A much simpler live version of the song (w/o the layered background vocals) and probably the way it should have been done on this album. Great stuff!!!"
3,A would be masterpiece,"Orange Crate Art seemingly has everthing going for it, masterful lyrics, production and composition. The only thing that holds the record back are the passé (even for the late 80's and this was 1994) keyboards on every track except Lullaby. The keyboards make the record sound like a lounge act or bad elevator music. I mean I ""get it"" ""Orange Crate Art"", but this would have held up as a conteporary Masterwork had there been only traditional instruments used on the recording. It's a crying shame! every time I listen to this I think about what might have been, which is sadly always been the story for Brian Wilson's and Van Dyke Parks collaborations. If any album could use a reworking or remake to improve the overall presentation, this would be my personal number one choice."
3,This album was OK in parts....,"When I purchased this album, I expected a Brian Wilson album which flowed and grooved like his previous solo debut and other 1995 release, ""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"". However, when I listen to the music, Brian seems to harmonize well, except it took me a while to relax to the instrumental arrangement. There are a good handful of songs on this album that are pleasing but on the other hand, there are a good few songs that make me want to try the next song eagerly due to the loud or jumpy instrumental arrangements. I find it fair to blame Parks for any of the dislikes on this album since there hasn't been to date, one Brian Wilson song I haven't liked."
2,There's only one song really worth buying this album,"... and it's the title track, ""Orange Crate Art"", full of wonderful harmonies and very well arranged, which is NOT the case with the other songs on this album. A cold sound which sounds more 80's then 90's, heavy and quite ugly arrangements, no great melodies to be found anywhere... So before buying this, buy all the other Brian Wilson solo albums (there are only three...), they're far, far above this one. Thanks Brian for everything."
1,I don't get it,"This is a terrible album, save your money for something better. Vocals are poor and the songs are forgetable. I was disappointed from the begining and can't understand how anybody can find anything of value in it. And I must add, that I am a big BB and Brian Wilson fan."
4,"Clever songs, lush arrangements, and Wilson's gift of voice","I am baffled by the less than enthusiastic reviews of this CD I've seen online and elsewhere. Complaints that Parks' lyrics are too dense and pun laden, and that the music is too intellectual and complex, seem to come from Beach Boys fans who long for the simpler, more direct aspects of Brian Wilson's songwriting style. Orange Crate Art strikes me as a wonderful combination of Parks' adventurous songwriting and Wilson's gift for singing and harmonizing. I find the songs quite catchy and the lyrics full of humor and melancholy. The production is 90's clean and the arrangements inventive and lush. Wilson creates a true ""wall of sound"" with his wonderful vocal harmony overdubs.Stop wishing for ""Pet Sounds II"" already! Brian Wilson still has a lot to say musically, and on this CD Van Dyke Parks gives him forum in which to say it."
5,The bottom line here is the music,"Some music can encapsulate the stress and strain of being alive and thus provide a catalyst for tears. In this case the catalyst for tears is provided but the tears are tears of joy.Van Dyke Parks provides the idiosyncratic, heartfelt, positive songs about a California long gone and Brian Wilson provides the sincere vocals. How Van Dyke actually got Brian to sing these melodic but harmonically complex songs is amazing in itself considering Brian's voice has been ravaged by time. That curiosity alone is worth the purchase of this masterpiece.The CD booklet art is beautiful and perfectly paints the picture of these vibrantly orchestrated songs. Songs that were obviously written for the love of writing songs. I doubt Van Dyke Parks and his crew ever considered whether this CD would be a hit. Who cares? This is art. And it is realized in a most honest way here.An Americana oddity well worth having in any CD collection."
5,Works better than expected,"I bought this item and a 10x2.5 inch chisel bit to help break through clay and rocks in the garden. A hole that took 2-3 hours with a shovel and pick is now finished in 30 minutes. The ""Bulldog"" besides being very powerfull is light and easy to operate. I have found the rotary feature very handy while mixing soild conditioner in the hole also."
5,Working well so far....,"We have to rip off 1' square terra cotta tile from a patio in order to recycle the cement under it. It's about 300 square feet of work. I bought this hammer drill because of the reviews here on Amazon and it arrived fast and so far has made the job a lot easier than by hand. We are only using the hammer part right now, but it's been working so far so good. Recommended."
5,What a Beautiful thing,This is a true Bulldog of a rotary hammer and I couldn't wait to put it to the test and it didn't let me down. I really love the way it look and feel and the performance is outstanding so this will go as my number one tool and I will give this monster a 10++++++++++ hands down. I have been a Milwaukee fan for a long time but if Bosch is making tools like this I might be making some changes because I had the Milwaukee rotary hammer drill and it was junk and this Bosch put it to shame I mean really to shame.
3,Great tool with some drawbacks,"This drill is very powerful and works great. However, the unit I had started to leak oil and also a little squeaking noise started to come from the brushes/commutator when I would stop the unit both these things worry me. I have had it for about a month and I have run the drill very hard and hot, chain drilling 24 inch deep half inch diameter holes into granite.I am not sure if the oil leak is normal, as it is not excessive and seems to run down the drill bit as the unit begins to get really hot. Beyond the 2 issues mentioned above the tool is fine, the power is good, the vibration dose not cause alot of fatigue and the power cord is adequate. However I am going to get the next unit up (Bulldog Extreme Max) in the line as it seems to have better heat dissipation and anti vibration properties in the rotary hammer drive."
5,Really good Hammer Drill,"I really like this drill! It's heavy enough to do the work but light enough to handle without a struggle. Some have commented about where it's made (Mexico) but at least, it's not some Chinese junk. I'm pretty confident that it's ""assembled"" in Mexico but with good, typical Bosh parts.I would gladly recommend it to a friend."
5,A must read,This book gives new views on evolution science. The author uses logic to systematically demolish every one of Darwin's theories and puts forth his own ideas (which he backs up by science and history). He gives undeniable evidence of a worldwide flood and major catastrophes.
1,nothing new,"ill keep this short. once again the creationists have abused science and made untrue claims.the creationist arguement is weak and his arguements for a world wide flood are unproven.the only evidence for a world wide flood is the bible.thats it. the facts still remain that evolution is a fact as much of a fact as the earth is round not flat.creation still hasnt explained everything compared to evolution.its safe to say that creation science has failed enough times to conclude that its not true.if you want to believe in a fairy tale world created by a supreme being some time in the last 10,000 years read this book.if you want to live in a rational world read ABUSING SCIENCE:THE CASE AGAINST CREATIONISM BY PHILLIP KITCHER AND THE BLIND WATCHMAKER BY RICHARD DAWKINS and see for yourself which arguement is more logical. theres a reason why evolution is taught in school and not creation.because the evidence supports one view more than the other"
3,VW Convertible Maintenance Help,"Chilton's manuals are usually pretty good. This one however, lacks some of the detail I was looking for, like pictures on my car's particualr engine and trunk space with labels of parts. It makes it hard to find parts on-line if you don't know what something is called."
1,"This is no ""One-L""","Marquart and Byrnes apparently had a unique law school experience -- one not encountered by most law students. The rock-star level of drugs, booze and sex (not to mention lack of writing ability) make me wonder what kinds of grades they received, and what kind of law firm would hire these guys. Fortunately for their clients (and their firm's malpractice carrier), most of the exploits described in the book smell of puffery and bravado, and I would suspect law students that knew them might have a different spin on the stories.If you're looking for a book that would make Dewey Nicks (of ""Slackers"" fame) proud, this is the book for you. If you want something that has a little more meat, stick with Turrow's ""One-L."""
5,This book IS accurate and fun,"I'm writing this having just finished my first semester at Harvard Law. This book is an all-too-accurate description of law school life. Contrary to other reviews here, I can vouch for the fact that class attendance isn't necessary and that you can learn a semester's worth of material from other people's notes in 5 days (and still pull A's). Also, nobody cheated on any exams in the book; law school exams are impossible to cheat on as they're open-book (this includes any printed material other than your classmates' exams).The people here aren't as bad as they'd have you believe; I have a lot of great friends that I've made this year, but you do have to seek them out from the dull masses.The book is fun, funny, well-written and should be required for anyone thinking about attending a prestigious law school."
5,Nothing more shocking than the truth!,"Great read! Much more than just another book about law school. Brush With the Law is a true, honest look into the lives of two people on seperate ends of the country who stumble upon the same place: a battle ground to fight the demons inside of them and attempt to see beyond the shadows of their youth. I found it suspenseful, colorful, revealing and enlightening.I'd like to see this book adapted to the big screen."
5,Essential reading for law students,"If you are in the legal world and hated this book, I invite you to consider lightening up. 'Brush with the Law' is something that all incoming law students should read. I am not encouraging emulation of the main characters, however, the underlying mindset of this book will make law school (and life) better.I especially enjoyed descriptions of the terms: cold-stover, zero-summer, and waist-up crazy. Award winning literature it is not, but 'Brush' never aims that high and hits its intended targets squarely."
2,Bong-Load Full of Gratuitous Filler,"This book is not very funny, entertaining, or informative. As a prospective law student, I found it pretty much worthless. As far as the format is concerned, the split, alternating-chapter narrative is confusing because both of the authors are essentially the same egotistical straight guy. They talk about their bong hits and orgies, gambling and drinking problems, and portray themselves as apathetic and their fellow students as WASPs with golden parachutes, but I suspect they are pretty boring in real life, and worked much harder in law school than they let on."
4,Polished Celtic Folk Rock,"The Killdares take a different approach to (so called) Celtic Rock than better known bands such as the Pogues, Flogging Molly or Dropkick Murphy's. They are essentially a power rock band with a fiddler and occasional bagpiper. They are more polished than the aforementioned bands, but this is not a bad thing. If you only like Celtic rock with punk attitude, you probably won't dig the Killdares. If you appreciate the more melodic side of Celtic music, combined with muscular power rock then you will love this album. They do a fantastic cover of the Leveller's 'Likes of you and I'."
1,Ungodly horrible,"Can I give this Group 0 stars? I paid a $1.98 for this CD and I feel ripped off. I'm absolutely serious folks, this is one of the worst bands I've ever heard.I got the CD, was a bit excited to hear a Celtic rock band who used bagpipes, so I put it in my car stereo. It wasn't too bad other than every song starts exactly the same... I mean the musicians can play their instruments... IT""S HORRIBLE!! I actually left this CD on the counter of the pizza place I went for lunch. I left it there because I never wanted to hear anything like it again.If you truely like Celtic Rock, Traditional Irish Folk/Punk; The Pogues, Dropkick Murphy's, Flogging Molly, even The Real McKenzies, do yourself a favor - Stay clear of this unbelievable crap. I dont know how they ever got this recorded. There must be some absolutely crazy recording artists out there.I'm out. I'm getting nautious just talking about them."
1,"Warning! Warning! Danger, Will Robinson!","I learned a lot from Marshall - mainly how to spot a VERY smooth con. There may be wisdom in crowds, but put a crowd of people who are looking for someone to tell them how to change their lives in a room with a con who's a hypnotist and you've got trouble, in or out of River City. He's good at working a room, I'll give him that, but there is no there there. What IS there is a bad toup and visible face-lift scars, if you get close enough to see them. Which I did. He took me for several thousand before I wised up - an expensive lesson, but one I've not forgotten in the years since. Save your money."
2,Disappointed,"To start off with, the embouchure describe on page 3 is incorrect. Do NOT rest your bottom lip on your lower teeth. The recorder is placed just barely between your lips.Then the presentation of notes is very closely spaced with only 2 to 3 pages to practice the new note(s) before another is added.On the positive side, the rhythms are simple, and good use of color and graphics."
3,"It's not that bad, but...","The DVD cover is misleading, all the actors are fully clothed in heavy winter wear 97% of time. I know this sounds superficial and somewhat deranged; sorry I yam what I yam. Second the script is really lame, perhaps the sub titles lost a LOT in translation. I do not get the unexplained fondness the training guards developed for the cadets. They were like Santa Claus giving them extra care and affection. I thought it was going to be a rough ordeal.The cinematography and acting were good. Storyline is nice but there is nothing original to the ending.The DVD I got played just fine on my 8 year old Mintek DVD player and I live in the United States. Captioning the ' DVD extras' at the end of the movie would have been nice as they may have proved more entertaining than the movie."
4,Cool movie,"likes the movie wish it was dubbed into English, but was in English at the bottom of the screen. could of been longer at the end."
2,Not that interesting to young children,"My six year old was dot to dot crazy so I thought these books would be a hit. Nope. The completed pictures are not interesting in the least. After completing two pages and seeing the results, he totally lost interest. Not a great item."
4,Dot to Dot Book,My wife enjoys doing dot to dot puzzles. This large book has lots of puzzles to do and keeps her busy.
3,Too easy,"If your child likes the challenge of dot-to-dot puzzles, this book will be too easy. The first half of the book's puzzles have fewer than 100 dot connections. My 6 year old finished them within minutes and was bored with the book after only a few uses. The second half of the book offers more brain teasers but I expected much more engaging puzzles. If your child really loves dot-to-dot puzzles, Extreme Dot books are way, way better!"
3,needs better packing,"Half of the necklaces were partially activated when they arrived. The inside bubble wrap did a terrible job of preventing the necklaces from bending. Granted, glowstick necklaces are fragile, but the makers KNOW THAT ALREADY, and should pack the sticks so they don't move in the tube!! Either provide better packing, or place only 25 sticks in a smaller tube. The actual product brand that arrived was Wonder Glow. I don't know if different brands are packed differently."
5,So CUTE!,"This book is so cute! The artwork is so adorable. I have looked at it more times than I can count and I still can't get over how cute it is. I gave my niece a copy of this book when she was 16 months old, and 8 months later, it is still her favorite."
4,Very cute,"Cheep! Cheep! is very cute. I do find myself 'explaining' the simplistic text or adding words as I read. For example, one page reads: 'Heap heap heap heap.' So, as the adult reader, I might say: 'Oh, look, the chicks fell down! They're piled in a heap heap heap!'The sturdy pages, rounded edges, and smaller size of the book make it a very cute baby gift."
5,Best Book for Big Sister/Brother,"This is the book I always present to the ""only"" child who is about to become the Big Brother or Big Sister. The birth of a sibling is a common picture-book theme, but the newcomer is usually portrayed (however humorously) as a monster, usurper, or rival. In the tender and funny CHEEP! CHEEP!, the new arrival is a welcome addition to the snuggly group. A sweet reassurance, packaged in a few brilliantly-chosen words. And the illustrations are utterly delightful."
5,Flat wall-mount for LCD TV,"B000AM8SJS 10"" To 42"" Universal Flat Wall MountThis mount is very secure and easy to install, Hefty and well machined - no rough edges or burrs. I would recommend it to anyone who desires this type of mount."
5,"It's Got The Hits! (but no ""beautiful ones"")","This set is great, so much fun on the first two cds plus some gems like Nothing Compares 2U and Pink Cashmere. Then the third contains some freaky deaky prince on some other trips, and a few beautiful ballads (Another Lonely Christmas, How Come You Dont Call Me anymore) + one of his biggest hits in Erotic City. It's got stuff like ""Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad"" and others from albums you may not nescessarily buy. The only fault I found was the cut versions (like someone said, Wanna Be Your Lover is cut), plus ""If I was your Girlfriend"" cuts the entire talking part (""and when I'm naked, what shall I do?"") But that's okay. Very addictive set, do try to leave it alone sometimes. It is a showcase of the best musician of the 80's."
3,Let's pretend we're listening to AM radio,"This is a fine collection of pop music by an important artist. A number of songs fade out early which is jarring if you're used to the album cuts. Hence, only 3 stars."
5,Love it.....,"i have been looking for this cd for months, got it really fast and i just can`t stop listening to it'!"
4,A Super Collection!,"I will not wax philosophic about this collection only to say that if you're a fan of Prince this collection has to be the best I've ever seen.You may wonder why I gave this collection four stars...well, to be honest...the collection of songs on the third disc just didn't do it for me personally...creative yes...enjoyable to listen to - no...the first two discs were fantastic...in fact, I replaced the 3rd CD with my ""Gold Experience"" CD...now my portable Prince collection is perfect!!"
5,Prince Hits & B sides,"This 3 Cd box set of Prince's greatest hits and B side rare music jewels are GREAT! I listened to all three cds back to back , and was in awe at how great every song was, obviously some more than others! I won't name every song, but lets just say that all the hots are here, or most! Like a few other reviewers stated it would have been nice to see a few of the songs from the Batman soundtrack represented , such as scandalous, & bat dance, but their absence in no way takes away from how great this box set is! Its nice to have so much Prince in one package for my listening pleasure , and I am beyond happy with my purchase!"
5,Complete Set,I have to say that this is a complete set of the best of Prince! If you missed on your past collections and want a comprehensive collection - this is it!
5,glad to get it back,die hard Prince fan and glad that I was able to get my old scratched cd replaced
2,MORE BAD THAN GOOD,"Prince has always been able to write catchy hooks, and put a good beat down to his music. But it's his words that have always done him in. With songs like Gett Off, Cream, and Sexy mf, its hard to enjoy the music, with out having to listen to his sometimes vulgar lyrics... Disk one - 4 stars, disk two - 2 stars, disk three- 0 stars. This shows how the power of music can do good and bad, but the for the most part, it show the power of music when it sucks."
4,A hillbilly story,"At book's beginning you'll expect a warfare-sad novel which will tell you what Wes's problems were and why he was absent almost all the time. When you see this is not the main plot of the novel you might be disappointed, but don't worry because the plot in the book is good enough to keep you in the story. I can't say that it is a thriller, but Storm's story with his new drug and Ally's love story are excellent. You will laugh several times during the diner at Ally's house. As many books, this one has ups and downs but is quite a good read."
2,"Character is not enough, faith is not enough. . . .","Yes, this novel has well-drawn characters (even the secondary characters), character development, and a fairly feisty plot that keeps rolling right along. But . . . as I read I wondered why it had not been classed on the back cover as an ""inspirational"" romance, because Ms. Sala uses a concrete deus ex machina, in this case a behind-the-scenes God, who appears to fix not only her plot but what ails her characters as well. This is OK, but for those of us who prefer the writer to fix her plot and characters herself, or who prefer not to read inspirational romances (which use faith-in-God as plot devices) at all, it seems like something is missing in the literary construction of the novel."
4,Fogerty at his best!,"A mature John Fogerty, who has moved beyond his troubles and regrets, produced an incredible CD for his older fans. It's as good any CCR album."
3,"good, but not his greatest....","i bought blue moon swamp after i bought deja vu and premonition. to be honest, i was not immensely impressed. although it has several good songs (like hot rod heart and bring it down to jelly roll), it also had so terrible songs,like 100 and 10 in the shade & rattlesnake highway. overall, i would recommened premonition or the long road home live over this."
4,Classy Comeback,"Southern Streamline and One Hundred And Ten In The Shade would gave made great A-sides back-in-the-day (hate that cliche), and Bad, Bad Boy would have sounded fine ridin' their coattails. Really strong material, written by the man, played by the man, arranged and produced...you get the idea.Obviously still proud of his Sun Records meets Lightin' Hopkins beginnings, he delivers on all tracks.Joy Of My Life is a beautiful love letter to Mrs. Fogerty. No synthesizers, drum machines, or off-key chorus.Can't say that I moved by all the cuts, but what a pleasure it is to have a real rock and roller return to the roots and say, there I was and here I am."
5,Fogerty's Music is still Genuis,"From the first beat of Southern Streamline to the final verse of Bad Bad Boy you can hear the genuis of the man behind CCR'S biggest hits this album is full of timeless tunes. For a true fan of this talented muscian for over 30 years you can here the maturity of the music. He can rock with Tunes like Blue Boy. Play the blues with the best of them, with tunes like A Hundred Degree's in the Shade.Then just play a country song like Rambunctous Boy(my personal favorite from this album).You must remember the Swamp Music for which John Fogerty is so famous is a mixture of all of the afore mentioned types of music. 100% original American style of music which in this day in age is harder to find. If you want to listen to an album with a vartiey of sounds this is it. To us old rock n rollers this is some Great Stuff!!"
2,Maybe for walking in a hurricane...,"I bought this album after hearing walking in a hurricane, and boy was I disapointed. I'm a huge fan of CCR, but this album just doesn't do it. They shouldn't have released a great roker such as Hurricane from an albumm so deeply rooted in country"
3,For drinking beer & looking out your back door.,"Hooray! 11 years, and we get an album that by most artists' standards would've been fairly enjoyable...John Fogerty is a rocker, as evidenced by the new live DVD; you wouldn't know it from listening to ""Blue Moon Swamp."" I'm going back to listen to ""Eye of the Zombie."""
4,fine stuff,"After a couple of notsogood fogerty albums, I bought this, cause I'll probably bye any studio album of his. Can't help myself.Anyhow, this one paid off big time. Excellent stuff, more country than rock, imo, but that's no complaint. While a couple didn't grab me, and ""Walking in a Hurricane' annoys the heck out of me, I can wholeheartedly recommend this.Ok, maybe I should be more specific, ""Walking in a Hurricane"" is yet another almost tuneless shout from Fogerty. And that's a shame, cause even at his age, he can shout with great musical force, or at least I imagine so.But still, wonderfull songs. ""Hotrod Heart"" is crazy fun. And ""Joy of My Life' is as sweet a love song as you are likely to hear."
5,Fogerty's best solo album,"John Fogerty comes out hiding every couple of years and releases a new album. The Grammy winning ""Blue Moon Swamp"" is a delightful album full of great songs touching on blues, country, rock and gospel over the course of its 14 songs. 14 songs you ask?Yep. The album has been reissued with two solid tracks recorded during the original sessions. ""Endless Sleep"" and ""Just Pickin'"" aren't as essential as the other tracks on the album but they are a nice bonus for fans that may not have purchsed the album before or are replacing it.The two bonus tracks clock in at less than 5 minutes. As I said if you have the previous edition they aren't essential. With the switch of Fogerty's solo stuff (all except his Fantasy releases)to Geffen Records the label thought it would be wise to reissue this album with bonus tracks to entice buyers again. The same original master created by Bob Ludwig is used so it doesn't really sound different."
4,John Fogerty does not disappoint you,"This is by far the best of John Fogerty's work after Creedence Clearwater Revival. Fans of CCR won't be disappointed in this more or less root rock oriented release featuring some excellent tunes. You get traditional rock in ""Southern streamline"", and a heavy approach in ""Walking in a hurricane"". All combined with some groovy tracks as well as some slower blues inspired numbers. I guess Fogerty doesn't give a s**t about contemporary music and that's the way we like it. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent the greatest Fogerty rock album since Centerfield!,"He's still got that Creedence Clearwater Revival rock'n'roll sixties roots songwriting in him here as a solo artist. Vocalist and guitar performer no doubt about it this is John Fogerty at his very best. Lots of wonderful songs and mostly the powerful lyrics in them he sings like ""Hot Rod Heart"", ""Blueboy"" & ""Southern Streamline""!"
2,*Echos the disappointing sentiments*,"I was excited to find a big thick book dedicated to endo. It seemed as if it quite possibly had to have everything that I needed to know about this disease. Wrong.As noted by a previous reviewer...the book constantly refers back to another book, which after reading this book I can't even say I am tempted to read. Most of the book was dedicated to 'natural' therapies, the dangers of chemicals in our enviorment, and cancer.I truly feel that there are very few women with endo who are going to benefit from this book. It is a giant list of DON'T's with very few do's. Any worthwhile information it actually provides has probably already been presented by a woman's doctor and/or any woman with this disease probably already knows about through previous research.If you have endo, I wouldn't recommend this being your first book you pick up about it."
3,Ultra-Feminist Psychobabble,"Although there are a few interesting pieces contained within, the majority is a collection of ultra-feminist psychobabble. Since I assume that these feminist writers were paid for their efforts, they too profited from the one they claim to be objectified and victimized by the male-dominated, Hollywood machine. How much better is that? With their theorizing and analyzing, they all seek to reveal the 'real' woman beneath the mask of Marilyn. Most probably they are all off-the-mark. For a better understanding of Marilyn, you would be much better off watching and enjoying her films, and reading her interviews. The painful truth is, we will never fully know the woman behind the curtain. She is gone and not able to defend herself against this onslaught of ridiculous speculation."
1,BLEH,"Yet another sad tale of the twisted life of poor old Norma Jeane. The book left you hanging on a sad note. It had several small essays (most of which were typical and boring, and of common knowledge to any wouldbe MM fan), some of which had depressing titles like ""The Love Goddess Who Found No Love"" and the like. Get it if you want to twist the knife further into little Marilyn's poor ghostly soul..."
5,"Like Norah Jones, Lucinda Williams and Sheryl Crow",She is captivating. I have listened to this CD 17 times. You can feel her passion in her music. Try closing your eyes and listenening to I am I or You already Are. Fantastic!
4,"For a previously none sci-fi reader, a very enjoyable book","I reconnected with the author of this book at a class reunion and planned to read her book as a matter of interest in and politeness to a fellow classmate. To my great surprise and delight, I could hardly put it down. Everynight, my ""put me to sleep"" reading became, ""I'm having a hard time stopping the page turning"". I found myself truly liking the main characters and getting a real vicarious thrill from some of the town low lifes getting their deserved come-uppence from a distinctly nasty piece of work called ""the spawn"". The pacing is brisk, the emotional content moving, and the characters well representative of a small southern town. In short, I think you will find this book fun, exciting and worth your while."
2,Break easily,Auger cable kinked up and wouldn't return to drum. Had to be replaced.Advance function is very slow and basically friction of the cable with the handle.I would recommend something a little more heavy duty.
1,Not reliable. Went through two in 4 weeks.,The first one had a problem with the motor within a week of purchasing it. I exchanged it for a new one thinking this can happen to any product - it was a lemon. The second one stopped working the second time I used it due to failure of the air operated on-off pedal. Returned it for a refund - twice in less than four weeks is not a fluke. It's a poor product. Do not buy it unless you don't mind returning things.
2,Warranty,Just try and get your product covered under the lifetime warranty. Numerous emails and phone calls unreturned. Product is ok but kinks a bit as can be expected but the plastic sheath doesn't last very long.
5,Great BeBop with a fresh sound,"Picked this up just cruising through Amazons endless array of Jazz Music.The melodies flow nicely. Serge Chaloffs barritone sound is fresh and inventive. With Sonny Clark at the piano , Leroy Vinegar on bass and Philly Joe on drums, they give all the great rhythm support needed for this fine recording. Check out Blue Serge while your'e at it."
3,will buy metal next time,"Works ok. one male end leaks after 6 months. gasket looks slightly smaller on the problem connector.The screw comes loose eventually, but can be re-tightened. if not it leeks out of the valve handle.my wife is not strong enought to use them. It takes some muscle to pull and push to seperate the ""quick"" connect.I work in water so im used to high quality quick connects designed for commercial applications, this is nothign like that at all.but it beats carrying around a channel lock. i hate threaded connections."
3,like the simplicity but....,I bought this for my blind brother because of ease of use but in any amount of noise at all the announcement is not clear because it seems to come from under the watch itself....
1,not for us,If you use the KJV and spank your children then you probably will like this. For us it's way over the Children's heads and our discipline doesn't include spanking. I feel like this was a waste of my money.
3,Results are mixed...,"The author's enthusiasm for these compelling stories is apparent in her research and writing. She brings to life two still-shocking crimes with a refreshing lack of sensationalism. However, the writing itself rarely rises above the level of a bright college sophomore's term paper. In spots, the editing is poor, for example, the author will reference facts that hadn't been presented yet by that point in the book. Too much attempt is made to judge by modern mores and motives, sometimes implicitly and sometimes explicitly (repeated comparisons to the OJ Simpson trial, for example)...further research into social history of the time would have improved the book. It's often not entirely clear what facts are documented (or how) and what is speculation, even with reference to the copious footnotes. Worth a read, but look for it at the library."
4,Victorian true crime,"This is a true crime book that gives details of two murders in the New Haven area in the 1890s. It's very factual and thoroughly researched, detailing the crimes and their subsequent trials. The differences between the 1890s and now are very interesting, including how crime scenes were treated, the technology available and the media. What's more interesting is that the more things change, the more they say the same. The book is very factual, and sometimes I think can be a bit dry, but because of its factual style, the author was able to include lots of details from courtroom transcripts and newspaper articles."
5,Dreamlike,"Unfortunately, I am too young to have experienced the golden days of gay sexual liberation in the 1970s, but ""Mineshaft Nights"" creates a dreamlike sense of what it was like to explore the very extremes of gay sexuality at NYC's Mineshaft."
3,Very focused on one player,"The Mineshaft is a legend in gay SM clubs and in in their histories. Cardini promises to show us what it was like there but instead really focuses on one person: the doorman, Cam. Cam is an interesting guy, no one can say otherwise, and certainly he provided many a visitor with hot experiences and hotter fantasies. However, I was really expecting to see the club in all its glory and was very disappointed when most of the action stayed nearCam and the door."
1,A Tad Bit Better Than Graffiti,I don't know how anyone can get through this book without wondering if the author took any English classes in school. It is all about a doorman named Cam and the author's characters all become slaves to Cam's every whim. Maybe one story about Cam could be okay but not every one.The writing is duller than a kindergarten class. It's repetitive style bored me beyond tears. I would rather decipher graffiti on a wall than to read this again. I went to the website listed in the book and saw all the books there are really soft porn or maybe hardcore porn since I didn't stay on long.I thought I'd read more about the Mineshaft club but I guess I didn't pay enough attention that it is actually submissive sex dreams. Quite a boring book and I couldn't recommend this book at all to anyone. I wish I could get my money back.
1,False advertising,"Item shown are not steel anything. They are plastic"" stun"" darts. Supplier shipped wrong one, promised he would fix it before x-mas and never has."
5,Faithful Rider-Waite-Smith Artwork,"I have recently gotten back into reading tarot cards and I read about this deck in a book. I love Halloween and all things scary, and I understood that the artwork in the Halloween Tarot is very faithful to the original Rider-Waite-Smith decks (which I can report that it is). I love this deck and it will surely become my ""second"" deck (after the Universal Waite or the Radiant Rider-Waite) and I'm sure that I will use it fairly exclusively in the fall. I liked it so much that I ordered the smaller version of the deck as well (that comes in its own handy storage tin). I highly recommend this deck to anyone who loves Halloween and the tarot."
2,Not for Win XP!,"Mislabelled advertisement here. I recently ordered this collection thinking the included games had been updated for windows xp, as indicated in the item description and implied by the title. However, the games themselves were simply the same old windows 95/98 games repackaged. So...although the games themselves are indeed classics, the system info as described here is incorrect and the games will not work on your xp laptop. Win 95/98 only!"
5,A BOOK ALL WOMEN SAVED AND UNSAVED SHOULD READ!!!!,"We need more women like Prophetess Bynum. She is a very real person. I may not like alot of things she says because alot of times she is talking about me, and you know a lot of us can not handle the truth. But I appreciate it though. I've never been lawfully married, but I have been spiritually married to several men. I know now by reading this book that i have soulties that have to be broken. I want to buy this book for alot of my old school friends and some family members so they can be blessed like I was. I also felt this book was a wake up call to not just women, but men as well. Thanks Prophetess Bynum for your honesty and compassion for GOD'S people because it is not easy to tell a story such as this. I know you got ridiculed, but God got the the GLORY anyway. When they ridiculed you they ridiculed themselves. Stay real. Grace and Peace to you."
5,McCorkle's Creatures,McCorkle is a true artist. I admire good short story writers and I certainly admire her.Going Away Shoes
1,Yeah Right,"While this IS ""Dramatic Romances,"" it isn't formatted as such. This is poetry, not prose. Line stops are important. Don't waste your time with this garbage file."
5,IMPERATIVE YOU GO AND GET A COPY!,"Part II of Mercury Rapids by Steven Johnson. What can I say!I loved it! A really good read that followed smoothly from the first book. The author has kept all the main characters true to the first read so you can pick it up and feel right at home with them. The story is exciting and keeps you wanting to turn that page to read more! If you have read Mercury Rapids then you will know that Steven Johnson's writing style is excellent and this second installment is no exception, another top read. Can't wait for part III!Simon Murphy Author of: THE VALENTINE ROSE & THE MURDERS OF MUTCHROSE VILLAGE."
4,A useful and comprehensive book on the subject.,"The first edition of this book suffers from a number of typos that can cause the JavaScript beginner a LOT of headaches! While there are many cross-references within the text, there is no list of tables, list of figures or list of listings with page numbers. I still recommend the book; but would like to see a better job of technical editing done."
2,not to the point,This is not the best reference manual in the world - that's for sure. I'd say i've opened it less than 10 times and turned back to my 'complete idiots guide to javascript' every time to find the answer after my search in this book.It just does not seem tailored to help web developers.
2,2 stars,"Although there were a few helpful examples in the book, the hows and whys were not written in a clear and succint manner. The writing style was dry and did not captivate my interest."
4,Great Value,"I've not had much time to use this lens, but so far, it has performed very well. Seems to be a little sticky when zooming, but really doesn't interfer with lens operation. I consider it to be an excellent value considering its price vs performance. If I were a professional, I may be more critical, but as of right now, I'm very satisfied."
5,great Lens,"Great lens ,sharp images and i felt its better than the sony lenses, it gives a good solid feel ..."
4,IYH: Badd Blood,"WWF In Your House: Badd Blood was the birthplace of the Hell In A Cell match. The WWF's October 1997 pay per view event saw the Undertaker take on Shawn Michaels in the most awesome match in WWF history. This is where we see Kane for the first time. You will also see in a special tag team Flag Match, WWF Champion-Bret Hart and the British Bulldog versus the Patriot and Vader. The WWF Intercontinental Title is up for grabs between Owen Hart and Faarooq with Stone Cold Steve Austin at ringside. The Headbangers defend the WWF Tag Team Titles against the Godwinns. In a Handicap Match, the Legion of Doom take on the Nation of Domination (The Rock, D-Lo Brown, and ""The Godfather"" Kama Mustafa. Plus, the Disciples of Apocalypse once again take on Los Boricuas in an eight-man tag team match and in a Minis Match you will see Max Mini and Nova versus Tarantula and Mosaic."
5,Totally Excellent,"Fast, beautiful, Archaic'Bring back a touch of the old world class and add an air of importance to your letters."
4,Little Black Pony Races,"I read this book about 15 years ago at a library and I still recall it vividly--which shows you how good it is. It is a very short book, but lots of illustrations, with a simple good boy vs bad boy plot but very satisfying at the end. Basically, Little Black enters the pony races at the county fair and there is a jealous boy who will stop at nothing to win. Good luck trying to find it"
2,very musty odor!!!,"my three yearold loves stories about little black the Pony , we read them over and over. However I doubt we will read this book much due to the musty odor!! It was so bad I had to wash my hands after reading the book to remove the odor. Sorry not Happy. Shipping was great."
4,New Boxer,I brought them for my daughter wish I could have found them in pink but these are good for her to start learning how to box
2,wrong size,"The gloves did not fit. They were too small for my child and I needed to sent them back to the company,"
5,Excellent quality!,Perfect for my 8 year old son! He loves these (thy are just like Rocky Balboa's)! Great quality and perfect fit!
5,They are so cool!,"Big enough but lightweight so you'll feel like in a plane cockpit The optic is really excellent and the combination of brown and metallic looks very cool. They are 70'sh but vanguards at the same time. Pricey? Not at all, I tried them on in a Prada store in Japan and were priced over US$ 300."
5,Trying to escape his Long Island mob-boss father...,"Trying to escape his Long Island mob-boss father and family, 18-year-old Vince Luca attends a college in Santa Monica, California; however, when his brother and several ""uncles"" suddenly appear, Vince quickly discovers that they are not tourists. (M/H) (RR) Hilarious, laugh-aloud sequel to THE SON OF THE MOB, which is filled with unexpected twists!"
3,An ok book,I read the book Son of the Mob. And I did not think it was that great of a book. It started out as a kid from New York. Who always dreamed of going to Hollywood and becoming a director.I think this book could of bean better. I did not think this book was worth reading. I think it had a good plan. But this one didn't stick.I like the plan. The characters. The author. But it was poorly exicuted.Over all I think this book is ok. It's a fine book. But it didn't make sence. I was poorly writen.
5,Superb,"This is Morrissey's greatest solo album. Melancholy and witty, as usual, with music that is more haunting than his prior solo albums. This is mature Moz, and compares favorably with his Smith's days, although nothing nothing can ever replicate his collaboration with Marr.Of course I'm preaching to the choir if you're a Morrissey fan. But if you're a new fan, buy this album immediately. There's no debate, no debate, no debate."
4,prolly the best solo morissey album,"morissey's solo albums can't touch the impossibly high standards of the smiths's ouvre... and it would be foolish to expect that.this is a solid album from one of the greatest living songwriters. his voice is also in fine form... alternately cloy and sweet with aloof and hurt.listen to the sample of 'the more you ignore...'. it's a great pop song with a killer, simple guitar riff. a good introduction to the man's work.if you like britpop... buy it. if you think that morissey sullen and sulky... you should prolly stay away."
5,I just can't explain (but I will try to),"""Vauxhall and I"" is probably the most critically acclaimed album of Morrissey's solo career and is certainly my own favourite. This is the most mellow, gentle of his works. Here the music flows marvelously from start to finish with stunning beauty while Morrissey's lyrics are as wonderfully honest as ever. Personal highlights include the opener ""Now My Heart Is Full"" (which references Graham Greene's terrific novel ""Brighton Rock"",) ""Why Don't You Find Out for Yourself"" and ""Used to be a Sweet Boy."" I find this to be the perfect album to listen to on a pleasant Summer evening."
3,1997 galant,"well i dont feel the difference since the old one was still working, so i cant say if its new. but these i say, it came in a plain box, no seal of brand new. so i dont know. at least its working ok."
5,Best book on film directors,"This is unquestionably the best book on film directors I've ever seen, and I've seen many. A film student myself, I was always interested in how directors started out, but never was able to find much information on the topic. Jarecki has compiled an excellent roster of directors and asks them interesting questions, reaping insightful information on the beginnings of their careers.The interviews are fun, informative, and inspiring. I loved hearing Brett Ratner talk about how he cold-called Steven Spielberg and got a $3,000 check to finish his student film -- I was inspired by Ed Zwick's discussion of writing and how even when you're at the top of your game you still have to keep working to make things good.Any naysayers are on crack -- this book was well worth the money. If you have any aspirations to make films or even a passing interest in how they are made, you should pick this up. It is very readable and enjoyable. Ebert's introduction is great, too."
2,Very Hard Read,Very hard to read and not well written. Some parts were interesting and enlightening. Others were so droning that it was difficult to go from good to good parts without being sidetracked into murky writing.I live in Hollywood and am familiar with the scene. It would be a good idea if the author spent some time here.
2,Disappointing,While some sections of this book were engaging - I have read several books which are FAR superior to this one. I find the 5 star reviews hard to believe. Did we all read the same book?
1,blah blah blah,I've found issues of Interview magazine more insightful than this. And Roger Ebert has completely lost all integrity. The guy likes EVERYTHING.
5,Does the job!,Used this to fix up a hox in my rear bumper and sanded it down nice and smooth. Did paint touch ups afterwards with genuine paint and it looks as if that hole was never there! I scoured a bunch of places before finally finding this exact product that I have used countless times before in the past. None of that new autobody repair fillers can compare to this!
2,Advertising,"This is basically a feel-good brochure for the Carrera GT. If you collect Porsche related books or are a fan of the GT it is worth buying but don't expect any real revelations about the car. Good photography some of which as already been published in ""Christophorus"",but the reproductions are very fuzzy. My copy was printed in China and the overall quality was pretty bad."
3,Just okay,"Despite some glaring omissions, such as the lack of any detail about Amon's first marriage, this is a very interesting biography, especially for a New Zealand reader who is old enough to remember Amon's racing years. The book is good but noticeably shorter than Young's biographies of Bruce McLaren and Denny Hulme."
5,one of the greatest,"I've seen Chris Amon race a few times in the sixties. In formula 2 in Zolder (where I was born) and in formula 1 in Franchorchamps. He was a nice chap (he still is, I suppose)and readily spent a couple of minutes with a 15-year old who spoke lousy English. Posing for a few pictures was no problem either. 40-odd years later, I still have the (black&white;) snapshots.I always considered him to be one of the best drivers ever. Victories and/or world titles never tell the complete story. Michael Schumacher is a mediocre, because very unsportsmanlike, driver with an impressive roll of honour. Amon was a great driver and, most of all, a real human being, not a walking advertising column."
5,"Big Hate - Great Atlanta band, Great Album","Big Hate was a great band and it is a shame they broke-up. Living in ATL, I have seen them several times live and they were great. They moved out to LA to try to take the band to the next level, changed the band's name (forget the name) and then broke up - maybe after putting out one more album under the new name. It's a shame when a great band like this, with their own sound, etc. has internal problems that causes it to disband. Anyway, this is a great album and I recommend it. I have listened to it many times since I bought it over 10 years ago and it never gets old. Their first album is really good too."
2,Be wary of these pedometers,"We ordered 75 of these pedometers for an office health promotion. Over 30% of them did not work right out of the box, and the remaining pedometers were nonfunctinal before the end of the week. Poor quality and/or bad batteries--we had to replace them all through another vendor. Money wasted."
1,not satified,"I can't get the reset button to work....so I can't reset. When it arrived it had numbers already on the screen and I tried to push in the reset button...nothing.I know it was a cheap price, but I did expect it to work."
2,All 12 Green Pedometers DOES NOT WORK,"Pedometers didnt last past 5 days. None of them work. I guess for that amount, what do you expect?"
2,Pedometer,"I purchased these pedometers for my company. I got a lot of complaints about them not working: either the batteries didn't work, the numbers didn't show up, or the pedometer didn't record accurately. We were very disappointed in the quality."
5,good pedometer,"pedometer is not 100% accurate but it's good for estimates. fast shipping, nice packing, trustworthy seller. thank you :)"
1,It didn't work!,The pedometer was dead within 24 hours of me receiving it in the mail...I never even got the chance to use it. Disappointing.
5,awesome,I was extremely happy with my purchase of three pedometers and the saftey straps. It sal came in a timely fashion and all items met my expectations.
4,Pedometers,We give these to our employees to use. They are great and easy to read. Even tells you how many calories you burn! This was our third re-order!
1,Additional information,"In addition to the informative review already submitted here I can advise any fan to visit the German Amazon (Amazon.de). Stop buying all of the US 31 public domain episodes and buy the the boxed set holding season one!Yes, it has the original Bonanza theme, the episodes are uncut and picture quality is great due to restoration. You can also read when season two is due for release."
1,german version in english?,The previous reviewer mentioned to check the German Amazon site for season 1 and 2. Wonder if you know if it is in English or German on playback?
4,Great hammer drill,"Hey it works well, did the job I needed, and is way sturdier and better quality than the cheap ones you can get. Splitting rocks is hard, but this thing will make the job a bit easier."
3,Some false information.,"Now, most of the book is fairly accurate, but for ANYONE who has ever studied organic chemistry or the basics of it, you will notice the false ""animal"" derived chemicals in the books. Such as a monodiglyceride. Let's break the word down, mono = single , di = 2 , glyceride = glycerol chain. That makes a monodiglyceride a single connected pair of glycerol chains which ONLY found in vegetables. Tri-glycerols are found in any animal. And the use of animal fat as a preservative would produce the opposite effect and I highly doubt any conglomerate would want that."
5,great resource,This is a great book for vegans new and old. Very good information to help you eliminate all animal derived ingredients (if that is your choice) or to distinguish between animal and veggie ingredients. I found this book indispensable as a new vegan and miss it now (i gave it to a new vegan and she never gave it back *grin*). Now that it's available again I'll be purchasing a new copy!
1,wouldn't work,I couldn't get this item to work after it looked like the perfect solution to broken eggs! Couldn't return it either!
1,didn't work,"I purchased 3 of these, one for myself. I haven't heard about the other 2 since I gave them as gifts. Mine had a hole in it and therefore didn't work at all. I had seen this product on the Rachael Ray show and believed in it. Sadly to say, I am very disapointed!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!!,"I bought this because the Rachel Ray Show gave it such a high rating. I saw some bad reviews, but thought the people just weren't following the instructions. Let me tell you this product is frustrating to use, don't wast your money..."
1,I wish it had worked,"I love making deviled eggs, and remember this gizmo from an infomercial from a few years ago, so figured why not. I should have stayed with ""not"". Tried it with over a dozen eggs and none of them peel like it should have. I used the 'piercer' like they said. tried just cracking the bottom on the counter like suggested, and even tried cracking the egg all around. The closest it came to shelling an egg was the one that I slammed my hands down on, which then wedged the egg in the opening, pretty much destroying the egg. Nice concept, but *I* couldn't get it to work."
1,Not worth buying!,"This product looked to good to be true! The egg slicer works great! However, the instructions for this ""eggpeeler"" was so in depth, it would be easier to crack and peel the egg by hand. The instructions say after boiling put ice in the pan and let sit for 20 min. Well, I could have the whole pan peeled in that amount of time. Plus a lot of other nonsense things like pierce the egg with a tiny whole first before you attempt to push it through. Well, I attempted to try it and it still did not work for me after all the nonsense. Good luck if you buy one but it is not worth your money."
5,An invaluable guide for students and professors.,"""Students and teachers of philosophy will both find it invaluable"" Brian Davies in NEW BLACKFRIARS.""What Grayling's book aims to introduce its readers to is nothing less that the most distinctive preoccupation of twentieth-century English-speaking philosophy: its belief in the central importance of philosophical logic ... In supplying a rationalised account of the main twists and turns taken by this dominant trend, Grayling has succeeded admirably"" Crispin Wright in TIMES HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SUPPLEMENT"
3,"Does the job, but rigid type preferred","This does the job, and it I'd nice to see the stuff inside, but I prefer the more protective rigid type wreath holders that are in stores during the holiday season."
4,wreath storage bag,"As long as you have a protected place to put it, this storage bag is fine. It could easily be crushed if anything were placed on top of it. It is nice to see what is inside of the bag."
1,Stan's Review:,"These are excellent strings which is a good thing since I have not had an extreme amount of success finding octave strings.Unlike mandolin strings, three of these strings are wound and only the first or E string is plain steel. This, I am given to understand from researching this instrument, is important since the Octave is tuned a whole octave lower than the mandolin.A mandolin normally has two wound and two plain strings.You might actually be able to assemble a set of octave strings from mandolin strings by buying a set of heavy guage strings and one of medium strings. Since this would probably cost you the same amount of money I plan to juwt order these strings. You do, of course, save on shipping when you order two or three sets at once."
2,A small book; disappointing.,"With the possible exception of the first voice (chapter), I just could not care about these characters. Each voice sounded the same; their issues were supposed to be compelling but little of what they were angst-ing about seemed important. Some nice writing, certainly, but a lot of it is unbelievable and ultimately, it feels a small book. Maybe if it had been sold as a linked collection of stories? I'm not sorry I read the book, but I'm sorry I paid for it."
2,VCE,"OK...so I am studying ""Sometimes Gladness"" and I really don't get the way poetry is so confusing, continually switching mood and emotion. As a VCE student who has never studied poetry before i find this disturbing."
1,studying dawes peoms were depressing,"I am a HSC student and i found studying Dawes poetry that they are very depressing. I do realise that this review is for your book and not the poetry but i just wanted to express to someone how i feel about his depressing nature. What i wound like to know is who thought of these poems for us, who are obviously put under enough stress anyway with the HSC. The poems i have to study include 'Katrina', 'The not so good earth', 'Enter with out so much as knocking', 'Accident and Ambulance siren' and the rest of them. As much as i like these poems i do not agree with the choice in poems for the HSC Thankyou from a concerned student"
5,Two-Stroke theory and port area diagrams,"The Jennings book is a simple masterpiece. He has taken some research that was done and published by Nagao, all to do with inlet tract delivery ratios, and without emphasising it he introduced the idea of port time areas. I am not sure if Nagao really understood the value of that idea, and it was a gem. Jennings read it and understood the value. He did his own investigation, and turned a minor suggestion into a real tool. This book is about the single idea of how to use port time-area diagrams. The other material in the book is good filler, but without port time-area diagrams I doubt the Jennings would ever have written this book. Written in 1973, and way ahead of its time, this is a must have book. This book really puts some method in to your tuning madness, just wonderful. Get it if you can!"
3,"It's okay, but it needs a better ending.","Please know that Brenda Joyce does not conclude the series with this book. She leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. However, I cannot continue to read the series. Please find a conclusion. These are the only books by Brenda Joyce I like. I feel almost as frustrated as Calder by Francesca's indecision and incontinuity. I think Deadly Affairs is the best of the series, and in comparison this book seems not as strong. Read at your own risk, lol."
1,Frustrating,"I wanted to scream in frustration. As the reader, I felt left out because I had not read the previous books. So I tried to enjoy the book once I accepted that the author was not giving more details about previous books. However, Fran's going back and forth over Hart and Rick was excessive and drove me crazy. Also, Fran is jealous of Rick's (WIFE) Leigh Ann, the next instant Fran is jealous of Hart paying attention to another woman. On the other hand, Fran is not happy, but resigned that Hart watched two women have sex to help further along a case she's working on. To me, the indecisive traits made Fran's character weak. Fran's character just didn't go with the storyline of the mystery. How Fran solved any cases is beyond me. This book was just too contradicting, did not have a smooth flow and didn't make sense."
2,Deadly Promise,"I am a big Brenda Joyce fan, but, I cannot get into the Francisca Cahill character. She is just too wishy, washy and can't seem to make her mind up on who she wants to be with. These stories are becoming a bit too drawn out for my taste.One of my all time favorite romance novels by Ms Joyce is ""The Conquerer"". Now that heroine had some spine. Ms. Cahill just seems to do one stupid thing after another. I realize all these adventures take place in a very small amount of time and therefore, the stories just seem to lose their credibility. I'm thinking it's time to end this soap opera and go on to another story."
3,Explains classic genetics,"If you loved Hemo the Magnificent, this one has less content and less animation. It explains how genes are passed from one generation to another very clearly, explains Gregor Mendel and his work, and hints at DNA's role. It's a good teaching movie for people with long attention spans who read at grade level (I'm a 7th grade science teacher) and completes the collection of the hardcore fan of the Bell Science series. Bright, cheery and optimistic in tone. Special effects are seriously dated, but charming."
1,Comforter Set,We were very unsatisfied with this purchase. The comforter fabric feels cheaply made & the sheets feel like something you would get at Dollar General. The fabric on the entire set is rough. The comforter is thinner than it looked. We are not please with a purchase we could have bought at Walmart for $50.00 total.
3,Excellent choices ... but ...,"All of the funky, in-your-face, play-that-one-mo-time endings were cut short. How can you appreciate ""Adore"" without that ending ""without you there isssss NO SEA! THERE IS NO SHORE. Love is too weak to define how much I adore you child ... you child"", or the way Prince breaks it down at the end of ""I Could Never Take The Place Of Yo' Man"", or that bad*** keyboard ending to ""When Doves Cry"". Just when you're about to go into karaoke free-for-all, the fader comes in. It's a crime, a travesty, a sin to cut the endings off."
2,Distressed in California,"What's the freak's last CD title. Can't seem to find it since he doesn't have a name like ""normal"" people. He is the sign, whatever that means! I'd like to give him a sign!"
4,Prince is Prince!!,"an excellent compilation, not as good as the volumen two but has good versions, excellent liner notes however the pictures are not the best prince's pictures but who cares!! ...this one and the volumen two are much more superior!!"
4,Good cd,"It's Prince... I mean, what more is there to say? I gave it a 4 star, because I thought there would be a few more tunes on there. However, that's really my fault for not looking at the tracks first, but I just thought it would be a little more inclusive. Still a great CD, regardless."
4,Prince Hits 1 & 2,"I was very pleased with the condition and prompt delivery of my purchase! I would reccommend ""Reima's Stuff"" to everyone looking to purchase new and used cd's!"
5,The Hits/The B-Sides - 3 disc set,Thanks to another reviewer's suggestion I checked out 'The Hits/The B-Sides' 3 disc set. It had all the hits I wanted and some I'd forgotten about. I opted to just purchase the download version for $8.99 instead of the packaged version for $35.99. I usually like 'the packaging' but I got 55 or more songs for 8.99!!! They'll be on my iPod soon and I'll be dancing around the house in no time!
5,Fascinating look at Civilization on the Brink,"The moment he heard the news about Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill knew that at long last the Americans were in the war. This fascinating book about the days and weeks immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor gives the reader an up close look at just how unprepared America was for the war, and how desperate the British Empire and Churchill were for the Americans to join the fight. This book tells how Roosevelt and Churchill built the grand alliance while having to contain monumental ego's, including their own, and develop and build a joint military command and vast military fighting forces. This is an outstanding book that I highly recommend. Fascinating characters abound. George C Marshall, Harry Hopkins, Lord Beaverbrook, Eleanor Roosevelt, and of course FDR and Winston."
3,No Holiday,"Two Canadian professors have written a generally entertaining work on the significant post Pearl Harbor trip made by Winston Churchill and his key military staff to the New World. During this visit, critical decisions were reached regarding the structure of allied war making command for looming battles in both the Pacific and Europe. The book careens between the light social aspects of the White House visit and the deadly serious policy debates.In terms of style, one particularly bad paragraph contains the phrases: ""politics is the art of the possible""; ""he had tunnel vision""; ""like a battleship with guns blazing""; and, ""a slave to his own rhetoric."""
5,Best of B's,"This really is the best of Prince. B sides are well-captured here, along with the more commercial releases."
5,one of a kind,"he does it all.. a virtuoso on god knows how many instruments, an inspiring composer, arranger, and producer.. all i can say is HITS HITS HITS.. they just keep coming. A MUST BUY!! GET IT."
3,A Great Collector's Item,"Movies have changed a lot since this film was made, and it is obviously trying to capitalize on the success of Blacula, but that doesn't mean that it's all bad. It's not the best blaxploitation horror film, but it at least it is fun to watch. There is an undercurrent about the ideas of duality that may or may not be intentional. The theme of the movie really highlights these dynamics of African American life at the time.If you are a collector, this is definitely something you are going to want for your collection, but if you are looking for a horror experience, you may be disappointed"
3,Where are the extras?,"The movie itself is entertaining. I am a fan of the Blaxploitation horror films of the 70's. My problem with this release is that it being a 35th Anniversary release, where are the special features? If you are going to put out a dvd and put a heading on it that it's a ""big"" 35th Anniversary release, there at least should be some interviews or ""making of docs."" with it. Movie gets four stars. Lack of extras knocks it down one."
5,Four Unforgetable Brothers,"Penelope Fitzgerald's father was Edmund Knox, first son of an Anglican bishop. Edmund became editor of Punch. His next youngest brother was Dillwyn, who played a major role in the British cracking of the Nazi Enigma code. The next brother was Wilfred, an Anglo-Catholic author and social worker who never told a lie. The youngest was Msgr. Ronald Knox, who converted to Catholicism and single-handedly translated the New Testament from original sources. The wonder of the story is not only that all four brothers were so great, but also that Ms. Fitzgerald can write the four disparate stories so gloriously. She seems to know as much about Oxford faculty politics as the working of the German code machine. I'll end with two cliches: (1) I couldn't put it down, and (2) I was sad when it ended."
5,AND THEN THERE was L I G H T !!!!,SO so sooo THRILLED I BOUGHT 4 OF THESE AWESUM TRULY WONDERFUL ITEMS RIGHT BEFORE T H A N K S G I V I N G AND THEN THEY WERE GONE!!! MY FAMILY IS SO PLEASED WITH THESE VERY COOL PRETTY CANDLE WATER FLOW TABLE TOPPERS! I WAS NAUGHTY & DIDNT GIVE 1 AS A GIFT but KEPT IT FOR MYSELF WHEN I FOUND THEY HAD SOLD OUT!!!!
5,Tastes as good as Gourmet,"We ordered Folgers and an expensive gourmet brand and we found both to taste delicious, full bodied and aromatic. For this flavor we'll stick to Folgers."
5,Delicious and Low Fat!!!,"I love this and order it in bulk all the time. The Soy Ginger flavor is awesome! The noodles are great. Nothing like ramen. This is pretty healthy in comparison and tastes a million times better. I sometimes add veggies or meat, but I love it just the way it comes. Great for work. It's so easy to make."
2,Not very nice,I found the taste poor. And the texture was even worse - rather slimy.Avoid. There are nicer prepared noodle bowls out there.
2,not my taste,"I bought this so that I could get food in my dorm room that isn't ramen, and I had had good experiences with this brand. I couldn't even finish two of these because it was so disgusting that I couldn't stomach it. I had to give the rest to one of my friends so that it wouldn't go to waste. He didn't really like it either, but he ate it so that he wouldn't waste it. I wouldn't even consider buying this again."
4,"Reliable, a bit slow","I've had this dehydrator for 3 years and it's had some heavy use. Easy to clean and reliable. It isn't as fast as the Nesco FD61 that I gave as a gift recently, though."
5,this is the definition of ambient music...,"I have just about all of the albums by Richard James (Aphex Twin.) This one is by far the stand out album of his. The music is for the most part without beats (I read in an article that Richard James wrote the majority of the songs upon waking his dreams, going into the studio, and making music of what he dreamt) and without song titles (unless you look at the insert and figure out that each picture corresponds to one of the album's tracks, which in itself is another mystery.) Some of the songs sound like what nature would be if it had a voice. Other tracks sound very futuristic and creepy, and get inside your head. An excellent album to fall asleep or chill out to, my favorite track is #5 on the first disc."
4,not moving...yet drifting away,"within the realm that is ""ambient"" (a rather silly term) there are but a few outstanding and timeless albums, brain eno, biosphere, maybe some tangerine dream, and selected ambient works volume 2 by aphex twin. there is a wealth of vast musical discovery in every grain of sound contained within the digitized grooves. just lay back, put the headphones on, and drift away. the analog sounds create a musty, dusty atmosphere full of bright spots of warm sunshine and dark corners of blue moods. somewhere inbetween all that you'll find the vastness of pure space and air. plenty of time to bask in that pillowy pink air and slowly breathe it in...plenty of time to bathe in the soft shimmer that envelops your brain and numbs your body. pleasent dreams await us."
4,Great album for relaxed listening.,The title of this says at it all. This is a great album for relaxed listening.
5,I Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove it!,"Like I said, I love this album. It's so soothing and beautiful, and when I start having children, I'm going to play this CD for them while they're in the womb and while they're babies. Every time one of the songs go off, I feel this deep disappointment and sadness, and when one comes on, my joy is untold. And I'm so not being sarcastic. Get this album right now, it's an experience. It's beautiful."
4,"Wacked and crazy, beutiful and serene.","This dual CD album truly offers a wide range of sounds and the subsequent emotions that follow. The first disc is extremely expiremental, filled with often creepy and scary tunes that make me shudder. Still very interesting to listen too, but you've gotta be in the right mood or else you'll find yourself shutting it off too soon. The second disc is much more melodic. One of the most beutiful songs I've heard is on this disc (arggh, but it's so short! ), and it is much more enjoyable to listen to than disc 1. All in all, this set is a buy, but if it is difficult to listen to, keep it on and you'll appreciate it soon enough. I don't own SAW 1, but I have heard it and in my opinion, #1 is much more melodic and easy to listen to, and is therefore a better buy than this."
4,sinister ambient,"Imagine eno at his most repetative, make it a little more annoying and a lot darker and you have something like this album.unlike Richard James other works this generally does not feature mixed up front percussion that sounds like someone riding a bicycle through a swimming pool filled with tin cans. Neither does it feature tracks that seem to exist simply because he liked a particular soundThis is easily my favourite aphex twin albumlisten to it"
4,Do not start here!,"I'll let the other reviewers talk about the merits of this release. I'm here to make one point:DO NOT MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST APHEX TWIN ALBUM!I did, and I almost didn't give him a second chance. I love it now (although I normally only play one of the discs each time), but at first it's EXTREMELY hard to stomach.As a first purchase, I recommend SAW 85-92 (if you want to relax but not fall asleep), RDJ (if you don't mind going from serious to weird, edgy to soothing), or Drukqs (for a butt-kicking with piano lulls). Good luck."
3,Too little material drawn out for too long,"Unlike many other reviewers, I will not remark on how strange this music is. You will know that by now, and perhaps you are specifically looking for strange music. This, however, is not the best strange music that you can find. Unlike Aphex Twin's 'Selected Ambient Works 85-92,' this one actually is mostly ambient rather than ambient-ish techno. Although ambient isn't supposed to be the most dynamic kind of music, I find that most of the tracks here are overly sparse and repetetive. Rossini said that Wagner has great moments but awful quarter hours, and that pretty much sums up my opinon of this album. It isn't bad, but I fail to see why it is so popular when there is better ambient music out there. Richard James should stick to techno."
3,Minimal heights,"3 1/2Early innovative ambient masterwork? Sure thing. Overpraised on principle alone? A little. There are quite a few slow burning compositions that do seem worthy of their place in the early electronic history books, but the sprawling collection together includes much lifeless drainage amidst minimalist inspirations."
3,Only when you're in the mood,I own SAW vol 1 and was very hesitant to get this release as I've read a many contradictory reviews on it. Now that I have it in my hands; here are my comments.1) It's too long. If the good tracks were compiled into a 10 track release; it would certainly exceed SAW vol 1 in quality. 2) Too little variations. Some track sound alike.Otherwise it's fine.
3,maybe the scariest album ever...,"(more of rant than a review I guess?)don't leave this on when you go to bed. richard d. james is a very bad man. perhaps an evil genius. why does he want to scare everyone.play this album on halloween and scare the kids.This is a well done cd and fun to put on in peculiar moments. But I really never find many times when I'm like ""I wanna put on Aphex Twin's ambient album"". It's for strange occasions and odd moods. If you are the kind of person who could listen to this very frequently, you'd probably scare me. I like it, honestly. The 3 stars isn't a knock. It's just not for everyone, even Aphex Twin fans. If you think his more not-ambient stuff is scary, it's not even close to this in my opinion."
2,very very mellow,"The difinition of ambient...Aphex must of been sleeping when they compiled that 'amazing display of 2 sounds at once,' Rich d. James go back to sleep"
3,"""Ruhbarb"" is the most beautiful song ever...","Honestly, I think this song is on constant rotation in heaven. It's so pure. I makes me think of white light, just nothingness. Peace and tranquility.However, most of the album is nightmarish and it times even hellish! Some of the tracks are dark and others are nerve racking (which is strange for ""ambient"" music). In particular, the last track (with all the wind chimes) on disk one is cacaphony-ish. I don't think all of this album is extremely brillant so I give it a 3. I know it's ambient but a little more progression in some of the tracks would've been nice.The best tracks by far are disk 1, track 3 and disk 2, track 12. Absolutely amazing. You shold buy this record just for these songs."
3,Not new not original,"True enough do not believe the hype .... On first listen I was impress at the haunting sounds ... then after a few more listen and well ... I could not find the addictive sounds that Richard has created in his other non ambient albums ...If you want haunting sounds buy ""Stalker"" by Rich/Lustmord. The tracks in stalker are more epic and created a truly dark ambient atmosphere unlike this plonging and droning ...Richard stick to intelligent techno please and leave the ambient stuff to the masters like Eno, clusters and Lustmord"
2,Ambient/electronic for those who don't know history,"I've been a huge fan of ""electronica"" since I heard the first synth on a pop record, say about 1968. Since then, I've availed myself of just about every bit of electronic music I could find.When this came out in 1994, I was underwhelmed, and listening to it right now I still am.This is bland, formulaic, and trite. Folks who think this is relevant have never heard Another Green World or maybe Music has the Right to Children or even something like Feed me Weird Things.I've never understood the cult around Mr. James, because to me he's not even in the top 10 much less number 1."
3,Disturbing,It disturbs and inspires me that somebody would take time to create this. I don't know if that's good or bad so I give it three stars.
2,pure genius? I don't think so.,"I find it surprising how many people consider this cd a work of genius. Yeah, it's quiet, and soft, and sometimes even slightly brooding, but it still sounds like an amateur noodling around with a sequencer program, a sampler, and a few synths. Tack on lots of digital reverb and delay, and you've got yourself the work of a genius, right?I think you people have done too much x."
2,this is not a classic...,"...this is the sound of a talented man making fun of you.. try the first selected ambient works or for good ambient listen to the first two orb albums or global communications ""76:14"".. bye"
1,wack...,this cd is nothing like his last ambient works cd... this is some psycodelic type chill room sh*t!... i was prety dissapointed...
1,"bleep, bop, drizzle",I normally like electronic music but I find the CD boring and at times unnerving.
5,Simplistic yet Brooding,"This is really something of an album to come from the man known as Richard D. James. I got this after buying Come to Daddy and RDJ, this blew me away. It's quite calm and peacefull yet it's quite distburbing in the same sense. Don't expect to jump up and dance to this, but it's a great background filler. I love his rougher stuff, but I feel that I've come to appreciate this album even more. Ambient to the fullest!"
2,Difficult Read,"This is a very difficult read. The concepts are abstract. The section on the Jewishness of Jesus is valuable to the general reader, yet the sections on the Old Testament are tough. You need to read this book with a dictionary."
5,EXCELLENT resource for memory problems and caregivers,"My stepmother has early Alzheimer's. Her neurologist (at a leading hospital) recommended this book (in fact, he thinks so highly of it that he has it for sale in his office -- he's not associated with it, doesn't make money from it, but just wants it available to his patients). I bought it on Amazon, saving money. It is excellent. I thoroughly recommend it for anyone facing memory problems (both disease-related and just general aging problems), and for their caregivers. It is both explanatory and practical. Highest recommendation.And best of luck to everyone battling -- or watching a loved one battle -- this cruel and awful disease. Bless you all."
1,I hate it,"I dont think genetics have anything to do with who you are unless you are ill. I am a sucessful black executive and considere myself to be very smart at least that is a requirement to be cum lauder in your school. I think that if you work hard for what you want and you study and eat right you should achive everything you want you are not predestine to failed just because your parents were black or Italian, or Irish, etc. Hey Dr. your ansestor have nothing to do with you been smart, however they have a lot to be with you been a fat ass looking guy.--"
4,Shocking read,"This is the story of Adrena, who was a terribly victim of child abuse, by her own parents. Adrena grows to feel better about herself under the care of Dr. Vivian Matthews, who lost her mom to sucide because of poor mental health. Vivian and Adrena grow a strong bond between one another. I liked the part at Howard's and Vivian's wedding, when Howard's sister tried to make a big scene, and she got taught by Max, vivian, and Adrena. I throught the book had some shocking things that took place, like Adrena's forms of revenge of people that did her wrong, but the book was good."
5,Nothing to say but EXCELLENT,"I just finished this book, and I want more. Adrena suffered what no child should ever suffer, but she had Doc in her corner. She could have so easily gotten lost in the system. I know its fiction, but its non-fiction to those of us who work in the field of Child Abuse. Incorporating the lives of Vivian, Maxine, Howard and Junior brought some realism to the book. It will take you through a gamet of emotions but you will enjoy every page. I thought this book was a little like PUSH, and a little of Sasha's Way, but a whole lot different also. Excellent, must read book"
4,">Government, <Non-profit","This book concentrates on govermental accounting, and really only has two chapters that specifically apply to non-profit accounting."
3,Okay album,"This album is not a big deal in my opinion. I only got it for one song actually, ""Flamme im Wind"". I'd recommend only getting this album if you're a hardcore Lacri fan. This album is not for the mainstream."
1,Sent me the wrong CD,"They sent me the wrong CD. Refunded my money, but that was it. No further attempt to fix the situation."
3,"Good Idea, slow plot","I found the idea of an inquest into Jesus's death intriguing and that is why I purchased the book. The general plot is good, but the book moves very slowly and has a number of adult situations written in that do not seem to have anything to do with the overall plot of the book."
2,"Tedious, save for one song","With the exception of Closer to Free, I found this CD to be markedly less listenable (=flat & lifeless) than ""Home"", ""Black & White"", and ""Love & Sex etc."" It is possible that this could reflect some deficiency in my taste: suffice to say that if you liked those earlier albums (as I really do), I believe you are much less likely to find this one at all appealing. I'm giving it two stars because, assuming I am able to force myself to listen to it more in the future, it might grow on me a little."
1,Waste of time and money,"This toy is a piece of junk. It does not have enough power to fly, even when the battery is fully charged according to the directions. After not flying, any crash causes damage to either the nose cone, the wings or the tail. After three attempted flights the wings broke completely. How they continue to sell this in good conscience is beyond me. Don't waste your money or time."
1,Don't waste your money on Megatech,"I previously had a gas airplane. I didn't have much luck with that. So when I saw this I thought I would give it a try. I bought this for $130. This was a complete mistake. The plane is pure junk. This first and only time I tried to fly it resulted in a crash. The wing cracked, the rudder broke, propeller broke, and worst of all the speed control was non functional. This all from falling from about 3 feet off the ground. The construction of this plane is terrible. The wings and rudder are made of a flimsy foam. The fuselage is made of a thin plastic. I was not going to give up. So I made repairs to the wing and ordered a new speed control. After installing the speed control nothing worked properly. Money wasted there. Tried to contact Megatech customer support hoping to talk to a like person. Didn't happen. They only respond to emails. Overall DO Not spend your money on Megatech products. The are cheaply made and you don't have proper customer support when needed."
1,Sheila,I wish I could have gotten the same understanding from this book that some others got. It is to me a hard story to follow. It has no continuity. The book was not as good as I thought it would be. I don't expect anyone to to agree or disagree with me on this review. I'm just expressing my thoughts about the book Somebody's Someone: A Memoir.
5,The pages moved sooooooooo fast,"I will add Regina Louise to my list of favorite authors. I fell in with her character from the very first page. It's a difficult read only in that Regina Louise has the ability to pull me into her story and each dissapointment she felt, I felt along with her. My biggest wish is for this book to be a movie. It reads like an Oscar performance to me! BUY THIS BOOK! You won't be dissapointed."
2,Sizing is an issue,"Costume is very small. I have a small 5 year old who wears size 5 and the small was very tight on her. I looked at the measurements and measured my daughter, per the product measurements the costume should have been big on her (she was at the low end of the measurements). I sent this one back and ordered the medium (size 8-10) and it fit much better. I would definitely recommend ordering the next size up from your child's usual size."
1,NOT ur daughter's costume!,"The sizing is off. Says ""fits size 10-14"" but it's really size 10. Beaides, this is a very short a d sexy costume. Definitely NOT appropriate for little girl or tween!!"
1,Did not Fit!,I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and it did not fit at all. Lucky if it fit a six year old. Terribly disappointed and a waste of money!
2,not the best quality but for the price its a cute cheap costume,I ordered a large which is sized at 14-16 on the package and it fits my 7 year old well. The hat is way too small for her head. The belt that came with is just black and there are no silver studs. Glad this was an inexpensive costume as we will fix the issues ourselves. If it had been priced more I would definitely have returned it.
3,Runs Small,"My 8 yr old daughter HAD to have this costume. It's of decent quality. She claims the sleeves are ""itchy"" and doesn't like the fold (when it's folded she says it makes it itch more). When reading the reviews I noticed everyone saying they run very small and order a size up. I was very hesitant b/c my daughter is a small for her age (usually wears 6/7). I ordered the 10/12. Fits her perfect!"
2,Lacking any wit or humor.,"This collection of cryptics depends on its inventiveness in the unique structures that the creators have developed for each puzzle. However, this hardly makes up for the forced and unimaginative definitions offered which, after all, is what cryptics are all about. For those of us raised on Henry Hooks' cryptic puzzles, this collection falls way short in humor, wit, joy of language, and the celebration of the enigma. After solving about a half a dozen of the puzzles, I have no desire to finish the book. Go with Hook or New York Times and enjoy."
5,Beautiful!! Exceed expectation!,I got this comforter set before Christmas. The set is beautiful and washable! You can't ask for a better bargain like this. This is absolute best buy I had for years!
3,Bad Weather for Racing,"TRIAL RUN by Dick Francis doesn't make it to rave status. Randall Drew accepts an assignment from the Prince to do some undercover investigating for Johnny Farringford. The Prince's brother-in-law wants a world class horse to ride in the Olympics, but circumstances must be checked before the games begin.Being in Moscow maybe out of Francis natural habitat, but in several places the plotting is contrived and plodding. Combine this with a love affair that doesn't go anywhere and murder left far behind, the Prince's last line, ""Johnny grow up!"" makes the appeal standard of Francis if it doesn't deliver the satisfaction.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Enjoyable mystery with a quietly competent hero,"Randall Drew, a former jockey, reluctantly agrees to visit Moscow. His mission is to look into vague rumors of threat to Earl Farrington, a world-class jockey and an Olympic contender. Neither the pro-forma Foreign Office inquiries, nor reporters were able to clarify the threats; but Randall's knowledge of the horse-racing world, and his careful observation uncover some very ruthless men connected with the threat.The portrayal of Soviet Union in the late seventies is rather bleak, exaggerated by the weather. However, despite being dated and generaly superficial, the thriller's observations are eerily prescient. The main character is pleasantly unassuming yet insightful, engaging the reader's attention. At the end, the accomplishment results in mostly intellectual satisfaction, making it less enjoyable than some of the Francis' more personal resolutions.--inotherworlds.com"
2,Not Large Print,"I specified that this book had to be large print. I thougjt I had ordered a large print book. I needed it for my mother in law who is 91. She likes intelligent book published back in the seventies or so and the earlier Dick Francis mysteries really work for her. They are briefer than his later ones and always superbly plotted. This was anice, clean hardback but it was not large print. I will continue looking for it in an Eagle or Ulverscroft edition."
5,Excellent novel in the Children of the Last Day Series,"First, if you're going to read O'Brien, I recommend reading his novels in this order. 1. Father Elijah, 2. Strangers and Sojourners, 3. Plague Journal, 4. Eclipse of the Sun. Although they were not published in this order it will make the most sense from a chronological standpoint. Certain characters resurface.The Plague Journal is the journal of conservative newspaper editor Nathaniel Delaney, his friendship with a local doctor, and his attempts to escape, with his children, from a totalitarian Canadian government that seeks to silence him.As usual, O'Brien interjects just enough action to keep you reading, and just enough spirituality and theology to get you thinking. O'Brien is one of the finest Catholic journalists of the 20th century."
3,Prerequisite: Must Like Ramones,"I enjoyed this documentary, it does a wonderful job of tracing the history of the Ramones and using interview footage from each member. However, I think the overall flow of the film is a little scatterbrained. There really isn't a clear timeline here.Also, because the movie uses mainly interview footage from Ramones members themselves - and the storyline is a little rough - it is hard for anybody who isn't a Ramones fan to follow along.Overall, this film does a wonderful job of putting into context the importance of the Ramones. No band has influenced rock n roll as much as the Ramones over the past 30 years. This is a nice tribute to their legacy.Worth watching if you have any interest in the Ramones, rock n roll, or the history of punk."
3,"A bit unfair, I think...","...to Johnny, who was portrayed as the Bob Knight of the Ramones. Sure he was a bit heavy handed, but gee, to keep those nimrods together for as long as he did must have been quite the task. When it was time to retire, I'm sure he was more than ready.Still, it was a shame that he and Joey weren't men enough to patch up their differences before they both passed away.As a drummer, I enjoyed the Marc Bell feature on what it took to play Ramones music. Simplistic as it may be, it took a great deal of speed and stamina."
4,Let's rock and roll with the Ramones!,"This is a documentary (or rockumentary, if you will) about the Ramones. The story of the Ramones is told through interviews with the group and their associates. They even found and interviewed the elusive Richie Ramone! The movie does a good job of telling the story of the Ramones, warts and all. But at under two hours, some of the events in the band's 22 year history had to be glossed over. Such as the ""Elvis Ramone"" fiasco, but that event is covered in a deleted scene in the bonus material. This is a fair and balanced account of the history of the Ramones. Rest in peace Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny."
5,I love them..,"The Ramones were known as one of the best bands ever. I love them many people on TV talk about them to this day. They were one of the punk legends along with many other good punk bands. Although only one's still living to this day, They are a really great band, and proved to people you dont have to be goodlooking to be a band, you can look anyway you want to. Anyone who likes Punk would love the Ramones."
4,"highly recommended, but feels very incomplete","the movie covered a lot of good ground with the formation of the Ramones, proving their worth to the world, the lives thru the 80's and late 70's...relationships with other punkers, but i feel it skimmed over way too much of the gray area of their career...they forgot to mention entire album eras and everything...and the ending wasn't great either..i wish they would have talked more about dee dee's legacies after his death...because i know johnny was still alive when this was finished.i dont know...maybe i was looking more for a Ramones legacy type of film where they go into large trivial depth over each album/era up to their deaths. it is still higly recommended and these nitpicks were simply a minor complaint i had with the movie. id recommend a rental."
5,VIVA LA RAMONES,"One of my favorite rock docs of all time. You have to respect how open and honest all the people were that were interviewed in this doc. Great, super, exceptional. LONG LIVE THE RAMONES!!!"
5,God I love The RAMONES,"Well i love this band,and owe my own musical career to them. Johnny Ramone is the guy i stole my style from.And yes this movie is hard to watch at times.And very,very heavy at times.But well worth the watch.Long live the RAMONES !"
1,"If you have an engineering degree, this bedrail is for you","After a few hours of muddling through the directions, we decided to return this bedrail. If you have an engineering degree, assembly should be no problem for you. We're going to buy another one like the one we already have (which was a gift) that does not need to be assembled. Good luck."
5,I am pleased!,"I had read up a lot about bed rails. Still I wasn't sure which was safe and was not confident about buying any one in particular. So, I finally decided to buy a used ""First Years FoldDown Bedrail"" just to try out.This was used on two children before I bought it for my toddler. But feel it still is as good as new and working very well. In fact I transitioned my baby from crib to twin bed with this rail, at 14 mo of age. He is doing very well till date. I just make sure to get to him as soon as I hear him wake on the baby-monitor. He even gets off the bed safely by himself if needed.I have had this for 4 mo now. Looks like I will keep it till he grows out of rails."
3,Not What I Expected,"This rail is NOT easy to assemble; it is frustrating, as the directions are poor and the parts do not always fit together perfectly. On top of that, nothing on the box told me it would require assembly! The supporting rails extend underneath the entire width of the mattress, which makes it very cumbersome to install, remove, store, or transport. Once you get through the unclear instructions and actually get it put together, and then have someone help you install the awkwardly long supporting rails, it does function well. However, I decided to go back to my old-style rail."
1,Not tall enough!,"This only comes up 2 inches above the mattress! My daughter could easily roll over it and onto the floor. They fail to mention that it is only compatible with thin mattresses. If you have a decent mattress or pillow top, this product will not work.....it's just not tall enough and there is no way to adjust it for the height of the mattress. Waste of money!"
4,Lovely Novel,"I found this book to be beautifully written, with astute insight into personality types and a very creative format. The book is written from two differing perspectives, each ""true"" from the point of view of the narrater. I found it brilliant for it's time, making it timeless, and I'm sorry she didn't live long enough to write more. A classic."
2,dull and depressing,"My title says it all. Bleak, depressing and slow, slow. I like character development and don't always care if there's rich character - light plot, but this . . . Pass on it."
2,Bored out of your gourd,It is hard to really pinpoint what I actually didn't like about it. What I can say is that I did like the pictures.
3,BRENDA STARR REPORTER,"I REALLY LIKE OLD SERIALS BUT THIS WAS ONE THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT IN THE VAULTS. OK THE PRINT WAS VERY NICE CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS RE-MASTERED AND THE ACTING WAS OK BUT TOO MUCH COMEDY WAS USED IN THE SERIAL AND NOT ENOUGH ACTION.HEY I KNOW THESE WERE MADE FOR KIDS BACK IN THE 1940'S AND IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE WEEK BEFORE WHEN YOU SAW JUST ONE CHAPTER BUT THESE WERE MADE FOR YOU TO COME BACK WEEK AFTER WEEK. I KNOW I SAW SERIALS WHEN I WAS A YOUNG KID AND I WAS OLD ENOUGH NOT TO SEE THIS I WAS IN THE COMMANDO CODY AND DANGERS OF THE CANADIAN MOUNTIES AND TRADER TOM OF THE CHINA SEA'S ERA 1953 AND UP.IF YOU PURCHASE THIS SERIAL IT WILL BE LIKE YOU ARE WATCHING A COLUMBIA B-MOVIE SO IF YOU LIKE THE B-MOVIES THEY MADE IN THE 1940'S THAT PLAYED USUALLY WITH A A PRODUCTION AT YOUR LOCAL THEATRE,THEN BRENDA STARR IS YOUR CUP OF TEA.RICHARD J.SPANBURGH"
3,Fun look at old time movie genre,"VCI says upfront that the source material was not up to their normal standards, it shouldn't keep you from enjoying a fun story, The episodes end with a announcer teasing you what Might happen next. I love these serials, having a female lead character is a nice change from women just being girl friends or side kicks. If you have to have perfect quality to enjoy a DVD than skip this one. But if you like the old school style of movies, you might enjoy this"
4,Awesome Road Movie!,"I had the opportunity to see the IRON MAIDEN'S movie in cinema, and I don't hesitate a second to pre order it on Amazon!!The quality of the documentary is amazing and I like it because it does print the personality of each member of the band and their manager!Just one more thing: in the booklet which reads Dickinson's notes on the tour, said he enjoyed the Chilean pisco. I'm glad IRON MAIDEN came to Peru in 2009 and I hope that Dickinson might have taken a PISCO SOUR and check THAT ONLY ORIGINAL PISCO IS FROM PERU!!!!!!!!"
5,buy this now,buy this now. If you have any respect at all for METAL and Iron Maiden... you will buy this and love it.
5,Great DVD Experience: Live Maiden!!!,"This DVD is great!!!!For those who live the great experience to assist one of this concerts (in San José, Costa Rica) and for those who couldn't (sorry!!!!) this dvd give us the enormity of Iron Maiden and the power and energy of his performance in the scenario.I recommend it for the Iron Maiden's followers!!!!! It's a must in your collection."
5,BEST WAY TO CLOSE AN AMAZING TOUR !!!,"Just after enjoying two Iron Maiden Concerts in Costa Rica, I saw this movie last Wednesday 22nd in San José and definitely it was the best way to close a successful world wide tour, an amazing present for all Iron Maiden's Fans. By far, the best rock documentary I had ever seen. This is a must have DVD for anyone who appreciate REAL bands, REAL musicians. In his first documentary ""The History Of Iron Maiden - Pt. 1: The Early Days""...the beginning and the process of conforming the best metal band of all times and now in Flight 666... other sides of the band and the evidence of Iron Maiden's positive and permanent influence. SCREAM FOR MAIDEN...COSTA RICA!!!"
5,Latinamerica rocks!,"Flight 666 shows the intensity, tension, daily experience and other stuff of Iron Maiden in its Somewhere Back in Time Tour 2008. The most electrifying part of the video is the latinamerican tour. Colombian crown was the best. There was people on the line, waiting for the concert, one week before; they also get big flags.....the second dvd is a selection of 17 songs played in different locations....this is a great work, to add to Iron Maiden's library"
3,"It's just ""ok"" and probably not worth the price","I don't even remember what I paid for this but it probably wasn't worth it. I mean, it's a blu-ray and they can't get decent sound on it? I should have rented this one first and not bought it. I don't imagine I will be watching it much. Sure I like to watch the concert footage and reminisce about Maiden concerts of days past (yikes, many days past at this point, how long has it been since eighth grade, twenty five years?) but I also want great video and great sound. The video is decent, but the sound is horrible. Really bad, to the point where on a number of the songs, I can't barely understand what Bruce is saying. So all in all, disappointing."
2,its did not work mine on tv,"mine did not work on tv but it work on my laptop..:(good my husband still like it,im kinda scared since its my first time to order dvd here but glad it work in pc.."
5,FLYING WITH MAIDEN!!!!,"IRON MAIDEN is more than a band...it's a legend!!! They got so many metal gems...they never sold their sound or image for money or more fame...Their lyrics are anthems in the metal world...Also, the MAIDEN menbers are nice persons, charismatic persons, ellegant persons...They are trully metal LORDS!!! If you like their sound, this is a nice trip through some of the MAIDEN menbers lives travelling the world...TRULLY, UP THE IRONS!!!!!!"
4,Great Footage Of Backstage's Shows,Watching The Documentary was absolutely great...not a lot of Bands Release A DVD or Documentary Showing Almost All of their privacy backstage and on their free time while they are touring...and watching this from a super band like Maiden Its simply Great and a great purchase not only being a Maiden Fan but Also being a Metal Fan! highly Reccomended
3,"Better than rock in rio, but still bad editing.","I don't understand why the people that make the maiden dvds can't focus in on something for more than 1 or 2 seconds. That older Rio DVD gave me a headache watching it from all the flipping around. This one flips around alot but not quite as much. I also don't really care to see so many shots of the crowd. Yes I know they are excited and jumping around, but when I got to a concert I go to see the performers, not other people.Edit to my review below.Also notable, the audio on this dvd is lacking depth that was on the Rio dvd. I compared the audio between the two. The Rio DVD audio was significantly better with much more bottom end in the dvd. To be fair I was using the DTS tracks from both dvds."
5,Light Up Your Yard!,These lights accent our lovely yard! I especially love them in the winter when it's dark by 4. It's great to see light out in the yard.
3,a horrible comedy,"What people won't do for money.......Carmen Maura plays a real estate agent who moves in for one place to the next, apartments that she should rent, but lives in. One day, the upstairs neighbor is found day, and while his dead body is carried away, his wallet drops. In it is a checkered map that leads to the discovery of several money bags. Neighbors discover this, and soon enough, they fight over them.Good cast, good directing, but certainly not the comedy of the year. A very unoriginal script.This movie IS a rather horrible comedy, close to a horror film in fact, but still quite enjoyable."
3,Great for the price,I got this juicer as a gift. It will liquidize any fruit and vegetable. The only drawback is that the pulp still contain juice and had to scoop up the pulp and run it through the machine again only to spit out in the reservoir again. Also cleaning the blade and especially the screen is time consuming.
1,bad bad bad,"After letting it charge for over 5 hours, it still would not get a decent charge. So now I'm back to square one. The manual says it should get a full charge after 2 1/2 hours. After over 5 hours, it was still showing in the red, not even close to 1/4 full. I'm not sending it back, heck for what I spent on it , I'm just going to recycle it. Buyer beware !!"
2,Moto battery review,"This battery works, but seems to have even less life per charge than the original batteries it replaced in two phones."
2,Battery life,I buy this new battery for my cell phone Motorola L6.I still have to charging the battery every other day. It's work a little better than my old one. Not satisfied with the battery. The seller co. had good service. I definitely will use the co. again.p.s. I also bought RAZR battery and it's work fine.
5,Motorola Ki Li-Ion Battery for Krazr Cell Phone.,The battery was recently purchased and it was shipped and received in 2 days. Product in use and has faced no issues so far (approx 4 weeks after use)!Channi
4,Caught by a Fish,"There are few books that I would read twice, but with me The Shining Tides is a perennial, one I've read every three or four years ever since I obtained my copy back in the early '70's. The book admittedly is not great literature, but it was never meant to be. Rather it is a fishing tale about a great fish and fishermen, a book on a subject few novelists venture to tackle. Like the newspaperman he is, Brooks' writing is factual, straightforward and almost sparse, yet he weaves a sufficiently intriguing plot to entice the reader on. The big bonus is that the writer was himself a real fishermen--and it shows."
1,Yawn...a book about Canadian music,"This is definitely for provincial Canucks who are cheerleaders for our music scene. Face the facts, people---number one: nobody cares about Canadian music; number two: it sucks balls in comparison with the life-changing ear nectar that has come out of the US and UK.You really have to ask the writers of this book---why ever did you bother?"
3,Poor Little Rich Kid Story,The story starts off interesting but contains much the same all the way through and can become boring however the background information on the old Hollywood lives and existance of many movie stars is interesting and at times very sad. As the book says it was a crazy life style.
2,not overly exciting,"and actually pretty boring in places. Some scenes go on way too long, and others are short and choppy. Sometimes you wonder what a particular scene is doing in the film at all (exotic dancers, bunnies????). Seems to always be a wind blowing across the sets, as drapes and papers are moving, the bird cage is constantly twirling. Falls far short of its billing as ""The First Great American Horror Film."" Very disappointed in this one; does a disservice to Poe. If you want to see early psychological terror, check out the German Expressionism films of the early 1920s."
4,A good book,"Had to get this book for a geography class, and enjoyed reading the stories. I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because I wish it had more stories about the people of Wisconsin in it, especially from the NorthWest. It is a good book."
4,No Problems,"I brought two of these in July of 04. I put them in my kids rooms. They watch movies on them everyday, and I have not had any problems with them. I am satisfied with them and my kids get watch their movies with no problems. Great Price and Still working"
1,ZERO - Avoid Apex,"I concur with F. Littlefield's review of August 28, 2004.This is the biggest piece of junk I ever owned. In fact, I just yanked it out, beat it to a pulp (After removing my new DVD of ""The Italian Job,"" and threw it away. Half the time, it takes 10-12 tries to get a DVD to ""load,"" meaning you have to open, close, wait; open, close, wait...There are also frequent skips and freeze-ups during playback. Apparently, it does not handle dual layer discs well at all.You get what you pay for. If you want headaches, buy this. If you want to watch DVD's spend another hundred dollars for a player that works!Another drawback: Apex apparently uses proprietary remote control codes, meaning you cannot program your cable or satellite remote's AUX function for the DVD."
1,Gave as a gift. Broke after first dvd!,I sent this to my father for Fathers Day. It stopped working after he watched his first movie.The return process will take weeks. Just a warning.
2,audio synch - big problem,"nice looking small unit that I bought due to low price and previous good experience with an apex 1100-w. but with both s-video or component video hookups, some DVDs get the audio track a fraction of a second behind the video. (on best of mike myers and law and order - ci). other DVDs play o.k. can't seem to figure out anything to tweak to get things right."
1,Low Quality,Bought this as a gift for my sister. It stopped playing DVD's within a month. Don't Buy!
2,U get what U pay 4!!!,"If you want to wait 20-30 minutes to watch anything, buy this. You absolutely DO have to open, close, load, wait, open, close, load, wait.....etc etc., then all you get is ""BAD DISK"". I would have LOVED to been able to take a baseball bat to this stupid thing. I do have to give it credit, we had it for about a year before it went wrong. But when it rains, it pours, the bad outweighed the good by a long shot!!! DON'T GET THIS ONE....move right along to the next one on the list!!!!!"
1,Apex has done better,"This is my third Apex and the only one I ever had trouble with. Some DVDs play in slow motion or jump to some part of the movie when inserted. It also has a hard time keeping video and audio in sync. If you pause it will be a second or two out of sync. You have to rewind and play it a couple of times to get it back. This problem is with DVDs, VCDs and SVCDs."
4,Kids' rooms?,"Who would buy DVD players and put them in their kids' rooms? I am a teacher and it's no wonder I come across students with short attention spans who are failing their classes. Instead of the Dept. of Education implementing all these regulations onto teachers, they should do it to irresponsible parents. In most cases, it's not the teachers who are failing the students--it's the parents!!! (See J. Page's review)"
5,Winds Aloft a Pilot's Diary,"If you are a pilot, this certainly is a must read book. Captain Charles ""Chick"" Williams has unfolded the story of his flying experiences in both an exciting and humorous way. The early years tell of his youth as an ""Army Brat"" and then on with his own military life, airline experiences and finally retirement. I had the opportunity to meet Chick earlier this year and found his story telling abilities in person equal to his ability to reduce them to writing. I highly recommend this book."
5,Read ALL of the Indian books!,"Very enjoyable to read all of the books in the series; highly recommend the follow-through as they are all fast and entertaining. Have purchased the entire set for grandchildren who also enjoy them. Well written, good for all ages."
4,"Sequel to ""The Indian ib the Cupboard""","In the 19th centuryPeter Pan: The Original Story (Peter Pan)was a very important children's book just as Alice in Wonderland.In these cases a world of fantasy and magic replaces that of scienceand realism.These stories delight the spirit of the young with their honesty and depth.This sequel is up to the original in contentand keeps the reader's interest and sympathy. Here we have time travel,( Red) Indians,toy soldiers, nurses , doctors and Texas Cowboys ( and a saloon girl)interacting violently with the skin heads and school authorities.And the ""secret"" like that of Peter Pan remains safe with those young at heart..."
4,gift,gift for my grandson who loves to read and reads rapidly. It is part of a series that will keep him entertained.
4,Fun to color. Fragile umbrella fabric.,"My daughters enjoyed coloring these. We had to be careful because the ink is of course permanent so expect to give supervision to small children the entire time they are coloring as this will stain anything it touches including your table. Use a piece of cardboard under the umbrella while coloring as the ink soaks through and stains the other side if you don't.My only complaint with this product is that the fabric was so thin. It tore through against the spines in two places the first time my kids took it out in the rain. Not as durable as I would have expected an umbrella built for kids to be. I had a little umbrella from when I was a girl that has stood up to 25 years of use, but these gave out in one day. That is a tragedy. Why don't manufacturers make things that will last anymore?"
2,not so fun,"I got the umbrella and after a few weeks it broke and was it too bad to use. I barelycolored it, because it was difficult to color when the umbrella was open. The colors ran when I used it in the rain also."
5,Uptempo / Improved version of Bout Changes 'n Things,More than additional instruments all songs were recorded uptempo from Bout Changes 'n Things. Once you listen to Take 2 you'll never again play Bout Changes 'n Things. This is one of the top 3 Eric Andersen albums. I'm surprised this is the version out of print!
4,A very good introduction,"This compilation, which draws from some of Hiatt's best albums, is filled with excellent songs, and it works very well as an introduction to one of America's best songwriters. But it is a shame that A&M; didn't had access to Hiatt's earlier material, especially from one of his strongest albums, 1983's ""Riding With The King"".But the rights to that one belong to Geffen Records, and so do two of Hiatt's other pre-1987 albums (his earliest output is split between MCA, Epic and Universal). So this isn't a definitive Hiatt compilation (the double-disc ""Anthology"" comes much closer), but the songs that are here are superb: ""Buffalo River Home"", ""Slow Turning"", ""Perfectly Good Guitar"", ""Thank You Girl"", ""Lipstick Sunset"", ""Child Of The Wild, Blue Yonder""...tough, groovy rock n' roll, folkish shuffles, and exquisite ballads coupled with mature, insightful lyrics."
5,FINALLY!!,"I love this album and I especially -love- ""Have a Little Faith in Me"". I had been searching for it for forever after seeing Benny and Joon and when I saw this cd, I knew I had to have it. Wait'a'go, John Hiatt, for some of the most romantic music around! ^^"
5,Fantastic!,"I got turned onto John Hiatt by some of his more recent work (Walk On, etc.) but I knew I wanted to hear more of his older material. This disc is simply great! I have since listened to a great number of his older CDs, and I will say that this disc manages to truly capture the best of John Hiatt. This disc gets heavy rotation in my CD player and ranks as one of my top cruising-down-the-highway CDs. Both new and old Hiatt fans will be pleased with this collection."
5,Great,"This was an excellent choice, I read all the reviews, fast shipping, great CD. I would purchase again as a gift for a friend. Thanks again!"
5,john hiatt greatest hits,We love it!! My sis-in-law will be coming to visit and we will be dancing the night away...Thanks so much!!Mariapia
5,By Candlelight cd,"I have had this cd for several years and have never grown tired of it....Just the opposite, I appreciate it more each time it is played. Such a soothing instrumental cd with songs you will recognize and simply BEAUTIFULLY played. I would like to find several other titles by these artists."
3,"good info, but too short",Having just finished the MSF safety class I decided to buy the dvd in hoping to learn more info or techniques on motorcycle riding. Unfortunately the dvd is very short (28 min.) with an additional 12 minutes showing other available dvd's. Only buy this if you are considering riding a motorcycle for the first time because the information is very basic. I feel that $20 is a bit much to pay for something worth about $10.
5,LEARN TO RIDE THE EZY WAY,"I couldn't wait to get this video! As soon as it came I sat down and watched it. I took a 2 day riding course here in FL last summer in 90-100 degree heat...I fell the second day only three exercises prior to taking the motorcycle rider test (to get your license)...broke my toe/sprained my ankle...what a bust! I never got to take the test...and I spent a couple of hundred dollars for this course! Okay, I sobbing again. Back to the video....buy it, it's excellent...I will watch it many times. Just wish Jerry talked slower. You'll see what I mean. Buy it...it's worth it and they do most of the riding on these big bikes (I have a 600 Honda Shadow VLX/DLX....Hello?) & they manuever them like a Rebel 250! Wish I had a dvd on my bike so I could watch and practice at the same time! That's a NO NO! Jerry gives you a practice sheet of his exercises along with the video and my video came within a week. Nuff Said...watch and RIDE SAFE!"
5,A Country Fan,"A lot of Randy's songs have sentimental value to them. They are as amazing as the artist himself. He's had some wonderful songs. I know the title song of this albulm was a song that I would listen to over and over again no matter how sad it was. And his song ""Before You Kill Us All"" was just hilarious. I was surprised at the hilarity of it but at the same time it has a seriousness to it.This is definitely one country artist to add to your collection if you haven't already. And if you already have the artist's CDs then this is definitely an albulm to get."
2,Too Bad There are No Good Texts on this Subject,"This text appears to be a must-read simply because no good text has been written yet on the subject. It purports to be a book by clinicians and practitioners for clinicians and practitioners, but there is nothing clinical about it. It is pure gut-reaction. Sterotypes are perpetuated, white culture is presented as a monolith, and everything is presented as dichotomous. Dominant culture is bad, other culture is good. It is a very ""in-your-face"" presentation. There is a lot of promise in conclusions that are drawn, but they are not supported--merely asserted. Here's hoping someone will rise to the challenge of writing a more balanced text on this important subject, so we won't HAVE to read this one."
1,This book doesn't address cultural overlap.,"This book has several flaws. First, it perpetuates stereotypes about minority groups. Second, the authors seem to believe there is only one White culture. Third, the catch phrase ""culturally different"" is problematic. Different from what? White culture? There is no one White culture. Everything that White American culture is draws from other cultures; African, Asian and European. The premise of understanding cultural biases is good, however, the authors fail to present anything other than a superficial, stereotypical analysis of cultural biases in counseling."
1,Two authors who need counseling,"1. Being cited often is simply a perpetuation of several logical fallacies, the most egregious being argumentam ad populum.2. The work appears to be little better than a defective, biased polemic.3. I am white nordic. I guarantee you my cultural ancestry is not the same as white Italian or white Greek (like my wife).4. The only reason this book was cited so often is because for many years it was the only volume discussing the topic. Only-ness doesn't make it good.5. The 4-5 ethnicities in my wife's multi-cultural counseling class found the book to be extremely argumentative. The only benefit was arguing about which culture was most mis-represented.6. Good counselors are there to help not to impose their agendas on their clients."
1,A unbalanced view on the topic of multicultural counseling,This text is written from a very biased cultural perspective. The authors have obviously had an overwhelming exposure to the American left-wing academic culture. The authors do not seek to understand the realities of cross cutltural misunderstandings. Instead they are on a witch hunt for a culprit to blame in already confused situations. This hidden agenda overwhelms the issues that are presented. The authors fail to address cross cultural issues within the concepts of basic counseling principles. The text replaces other forms of ignorance with another. I would recommend avoiding it.
5,must have for helping professionals,"There is so much relevant and valued information in this book pertaining to different cultures and ethnicities. Very well written, easy to read, informative and a must have for anyone working in the helping profession. This book brings to light many issues, contexts and ideas that are not directly addressed or dealt with in the classroom. If you are working with diverse populations, or need to take a license exam for Social Work, this book is a MUST have!!! Very helpful, and informative."
5,Challenging enough to stimulate synthesis...........,"This book is an outstanding text. It is often challenging for my Euro-American graduate students to read, yet it stimulates intense debate. I balance the presentation with speakers, other books, and group processing. This book is cogent, concise, and has a marvellously succinct history of the politics and development of the concepts of multicultural and diversity counseling. You may not prefer it, but you MUST read it to be current in this field"
3,Chain arrangment doesn't work,"This piece does look better than the photos and was larger than expected. However, the Figure Eight piece doesn't have a place for the chain, so the chain is simply wrapped around the Figure Eight itself. This shortens the chain and means that there is no ""give"" in the chain itself. I plan on keeping the piece, but taking it to a jeweler to see if something can be added so that the chain works. Unfortunately, now that I look at the photo closely I can see it."
3,A little flashy,"Like others have mentioned, the way that the chain loops around the pendant is less than ideal. The pendant flips over a lot more than I would hope for. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it though. The length is perfect for a v neck or scoop neck blouse. I think it will grow on me over time but if I had seen it in the store I don't think I would have purchased it. It's a little flashier than I was expecting."
