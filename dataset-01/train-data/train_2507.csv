4,"Great collection, but...","This is a very important document for the New Order/Joy Division fan, but the encoding of ""Transmission"" is such that it will only play on a computer, and cannot be imported into iTunes or any other audio software. The rest of the disk is great, though."
4,Holy Soul Jelly Roll,"This is a fun, easy read that sketches Ginsberg and attendant loonies at the height of his reign as May King of the '60s Underground. Essentially an expanded New Yorker portrait, it tracks the poet's dizzying movements from the Jan. '67 San Francisco Be-In to its New York sequel that Easter. Kramer lays on the color a little thick in places--she's clearly writing for amused and knowing squares--but she's very much alive to the idealism of Ginsberg's slaphappy search for satori in the midst of hectic times. Kind of an 'Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test' Lite, ""A.G. in America"" is a breezy contribution to the Sixties myth."
5,I love this book!,"This book has been a revelation to me. I sheepishly admit that I knew little about Allen Ginsberg or his poetry. When I read somewhere that Ginsberg and others had met with the Dalai Lama when they were in India in the early 60s and tried to convince him to drop acid, I thought I've got to read something about this guy. This book appears to capture Ginsberg and his times. I adore the amazing way that he seemed to relate with such empathy and insight with everyone he met: mainstream politicians, Hells Angels, activists, critics and hippies, straights and squares he had a knack for knowing what to say and how to say it to help people to wake up ... even if just a little. I laughed, I cried. Okay, mostly laughed. And I was gratefully informed. What a groovy book!"
3,Cd cases,Yes they are slim but flimsy some fell apart. Price was fair what what I got and they are slim next time would buy better quality.
4,"Good quality, but the same type by Dynex is somewhat better","I have both the Memorex and Dynex brands of clear, slim jewel cases for CD/DVD's to review and compare. They are essentially the same except the Dynex brand has the Compact Disc logo stamped in the inside cover. Both have the frosted back cover. See my photo here on Amazon.The Dynex brand of jewel case that I have is apparently not available on Amazon but it is available at Best Buy. It feels slightly sturdier and flexes less when I twist it gently with my hands. My electronic scale has the same reading for each of 1.3 ounces.My order of 2 30-PK cases was undamaged. I opened every case to check because of the problems some of the reviewers have with Amazon's lack of good packing methods.I plan to get the Dynex cases instead of the Memorex version the next time I need to restock."
4,Fine CD cases,"These are as advertised, slim jewel cases. They are as sturdy as you would expect and reasonably priced. I'd buy them again."
5,Charlie Barnet on Everest Stereo,Everest Record company broke the mold of sound when they produced the high class recording artist Charlie Barnet and his big band from their Bellock mechanisms. It is the only recording I can actually say that can take me as far back in STYLE from the roaring twenties to the present day recording sessions in 1959 with the ultimate clarity in stereo sound. The recording quality is unmatched as were the artists on the compact disc. If you want to here how the beginners of jazz played and sounded at the peak in their careers here is the recording to listen to and learn from.
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!,"In HER SECRET GUARDIAN, we meet Dr. Grace Evans, a woman determined to make a difference striving to forget the horrible event that changed her life forever. We also meet sexy but haunted Sean Patrick Douglass, a man determined to save Grace from herself while trying to make amends for his part in the great tragedy in her past, even if it means losing his life in the process.HER SECRET GUARDIAN is a spectacular read filled with suspense, drama, action, and heartwrenching romance. It's a page-turner you won't put down until the very end. You'll love it. Trust me."
3,Not enough information,"The author devotes almost the entire book explaining the meaning of colors. Throughout the whole book, the explanations are repetitious. The author could have explained more about the shape of the auras and the different intensities of the colors(bright/dull, sharp/soft) and how they relate to each kind of human emotions (sad, happy, jealous, angry). Instead, the author give very little information of what aura truly is. The book is thick due to many repetitions of describing what the colors mean."
5,A Layman's Guide to Auras,Pamala Oslie is extremely gifted as she explains how to evaluate yourown aura and what it all means......this book is a gift to yourself....andeveryone you know. Also her writing style is easy to understand andentertaining to read. A definite buy!
5,Great Item,I ordered these for my sister and I to share as there are so many. They are better than I expected. Great price FAST shipping very pleased!
2,I'm not so sure,"I bought this product along with the anti-icky poo because I have an idiot orange tabby who has decided he has to mark his territory..inside. ANYWAY...I have used other products and they advised you buy this product if other products had been used before so it would make the anti-ickpoo product to work more effectively. uhm...not so much, in my opinion. I wound up destroying and/or discarding what I tried to treat as it might last for a day or so..but the smell would keep coming back, and to me, worse than it had been before the treatment. Granted, this was on an artificial Christmas tree, and may have worked better on a carpet or whatever...but it sure didn't help on upholstery.It's expensive, and they say you need to dilute it...REALLY? It comes in a spray bottle..so now I have to go out and get another bottle to follow the instructions. Full strength or diluted, not so much and I will not waste my money on any more of this product."
3,Not as impressive for me as other reviews,"Maybe our stains were just that bad, that nothing would work on them, but from what I found, this really didn't work as advertised."
4,Great Book,"Bought this book a few years back to help me through a certification test. It's a great book that I own, but if I want a digital copy, I have to buy it again!?! Not fair by any means!"
2,"Mixed, at best.","There are no question and answers in the back of each chapter. And the exams are not split up by chapter: plus you have to download the exams, in addition of having to install a rather extensive test harness."
3,Meh.. okay I guess,"These books helped me pass the exam but I am glad I had prior knowledge. If not, the typos in this book and exam questions could have been very misleading. There were many times I knew that either were wrong. It was very frustrating with the exam questions. First, they don't give that many of them and second, half have typos. If the CCNA wasn't such an easy exam, these books would not have sufficed. I am not looking forward to the Cisco press' CCNP books but there aren't that many choices out there."
4,Just great in my opinion,"The two books contained on the package are simply great, even for beginners!The only thing I could miss, is some more examples and practice exercises, but in average is all ok!"
5,Excellent Resource,"I just passed my CCNA exam two days ago using these texts and the included Boson Exam Sim Engine as my primary study tools. I also purchased two 2950 switches, and 2610xm, 2621, 1720 routers."
4,Pretty much what you need,"First of all I am recertifying after 5+years so I am not starting from zero. This book is what you need to get certified, I loved the fact that came with the PDF version of the book.I didint gave it 5 stars because I would like more boson questions and because they try to make it for beginners sometimes they take too long with their ""Fred and Barney"" explanations, but again this applies for me bacause I am not a beginner, If you are a beginner you may like it. Anyway, this is not a critical issue with the book."
5,It helped me pass,"This was a fantastic study guide for me. The book covers all the topics in depth, with some useful starter quizzes, and tests at the end of each chapter for you to really test yourself. It has a bundle of printable appendices, including memory tables, command line questions and more.I wouldn't go for this as a sole study guide - I found it useful after completing the CCNA course at a college. However, it's really helpful to remind you of everything the course covers, and prepare you for the exam. This book helped me pass my CCNA."
4,Great study guide,"Contains everything you need to know about Cisco switches and routers. I mean come on, it was written by Cisco. If you try to purchase the books separate you will end up paying twice as much. Also good to have on the shelf if you do a fair amount of programming."
4,A Great Study Guide,"I originally purchased this guide to prepare to take the CCNA exam. After studying the guide and completing the exercises I am very confident that I am adequately prepared to pass the CCNA. Additionally, I have used the guide numerous times as a reference for switching best practices. The guide is formatted in such a way that it presents the very basic fundamentals first, then works up the to more complex routing and switching principles. The beginning of each chapter provides a summary of what will be covered allowing you to skip the section if you are familiar with the material. At the end of each section is a lab like section that will help you apply the material learned in the section to a real world example."
5,Core CCNA Knowledge,I used this box set along with a borrowed lab to prepare for the 640-802 composite CCNA exam and passed. These books tend to be over informative regarding almost every topic presented and that is why I love them. If you study these books well and put what you learn into practice until you not only know the 'hows' but the 'whys' you will be more than adequately prepared.I did find the subnetting chapter somewhat confusing and I recommend reading chapter 3 of Todd Lammle's CCNA book for an easy to approach way of subnetting.
5,Very well written technical guide,"I read both of these books from front to back, while doing doing hands on practicing with Cisco gear. One thing I liked about these books is that I feel it gives you more than what you need to pass the exam, rather than the bare minimum. I did learn a good amount from reading these books, and I passed my CCNA the first time I took it earlier this week.In order to pass the exam, I would recommend that you get hands on experience with Cisco routers and switches if possible. For those that don't have multiple routers at their disposal, GNS3 is a useful, free tool that allows you to test virtualized routers.I've heard that the DVD that comes with the book has a good testing engine, although I didn't try it. I've been using the Transcenders practice exams for sometime, and I find them good because they seem harder than the actual exams.I would definitely recommend these books. Good luck to you in your studies."
3,Not so good.,"I think the writer or writers over writing certain subjects (some switching and routing concept). I felt that a lot of things was over explain to were you would never really understand what you needed to know. The book does give you complete coverage. I took the test and there are certain key points that you needed to remember, but it is hard to pick up on these points, when the writer is over exaggeration his explanations to fill up pages. To be honest; both of these books could have been better summarize into one book. Wendell; I think you need to Auto Summarize these books a little bit better. Also, the testing software did not work for me. I remember reading the older version of Cisco Press 801, were the test questions took over and help you a lot after reading the text."
5,Un tres bon livre,"Bonjour a tous. Je viens de reussir cet examen en utilisant ce livre.Ce livre est formidable, et il vous permet de cerner tous les aspects de la certification CCNA.Je vous le recommande fortement.Merci"
4,Non ha bisogno di commenti,"Se volete prendere la certificazione CCNA è perfetto, è spiegato veramente bene, anche per non esperti."
5,Time to realize you can achieve your dreams....,"This is the one book to read if you really want a personal look at success and inspiration. Frank not only tells you many ways to improve your ""success"", but also provides valuable insight to the benefits of giving back to your community, and helping others feel better about themselves.This is a great business book, but more importantly, this is a fantastic life book. Read it now! Don't wait! The life you change may be your own!"
5,Teacher Will Use Book In Class,"I am a high school economics and government teacher. I found the content in Frank's book worthy of being used in my business class. Well written and educational book. If you are reading this review I hope it compels you to purchase this learning tool. Hey, let's keep the reviews about the book and its content. If someone doesn't like the book that is fine and it should be shared. If someone (""No Need To Conform"") does not like Frank or is jealous of Frank, keep it off the book reviews!"
3,Not really what I was expecting,"I purchased this book as part of a book club. We have only gone through a couple of chapters, and I can already tell it's not what I was expecting. While I have nothing against the authors dreams and ambitions, I'm not into real estate, I'm just a few years out from retirement so am not looking to make a career change, and I'm too risk adverse to just take that chance. And, I haven't figured out what I want to be when I grow up, so that doesn't help me either :). I hesitated to give a low score, since the book might be more beneficial for others, but it just isn't my cup of tea."
2,Quality Uneven,"I ordered several of these for my video collection -- great concept, look nice from a distance -- but up close -- quality is very uneven -- literally and metaphorically. On one the wood is splitting, on another, one side is higher than another (prevents stacking), and another looks like the wood was damaged before it was put together. Or should I say particle board. Good news is that Amazon was very good about taking back the worst one -- they would have taken them all back, but I didn't want the hassle of shipping/replacing three. I'm just going to live with the other ""not-perfect"" ones."
4,what a ride,"not a bad show if your in the mood for a show that take a little time to get going all about a woman that is seeing a congress man and has to break up with him but he did,t want to they fight and he gets killed she is in with some crooks trying to mess up the congress mans work and that are going to kill her she runs off trying to get out of the USA and pays a cab driver to take her across the USA you get the idea!"
4,Moments in Time,"All my life I've been fascinated by the history of that time just before i was born - Sports, Art, Jazz, Film and the written word. Miss Schoenberger manages well enough to fill in those gaps regarding Robert Lowell that his letters, and other biographies do not. It's a glimpse into the mad world of the Guinness clan as well, and reeks of cigarette smoke and booze. My only serious complaint would be the quality of he photographic printing - poor. But it is another good link in the chain of literature from that period."
4,Another Legendary Beauty/Muse Story,"This is a very romanticized viewpoint of Lady Caroline's troubled life but it was so well written and readable that it was impossible to put down. Like most of these type of lengends, Lillie Langtry comes to mind, she was famous mostly for who she bedded and who she knew. BUT, there is MORE. Like Langtry, Lady Blackwood inspired whomever she came in contact with. Some woman just have that persona and I don't feel it is fair to overlook that part of their history. Once again, we put all the blame on the woman and forget that the MEN also had a say in their attachments to her lure. Her beauty was more an entire package rather than the classic sense of beauty, per se. I highly recommend this book to all Langtry fans and the woman who are interested in these types of tastemakers."
5,good tough belt,"Great rigid belt, good for carrying magazines and pistol holster. Did a handgun class with it and it worked flawlessly."
3,An okay duty belt,"I bought this to allow me to side carry my hand cannon. When it arrived, i found the belt to be VERY stiff and almost impossible to adjust without a lot of muscle. I bought it bigger than i needed in order to make sure i had enough adjustment to secure it tightly. I am going to try washing is a few times to see if it will relax some and make it easier to adjust. Not a bad product but a little to stiff for my liking."
2,Not The Greatest Duty Belt,"While I have used the same duty belt in the past, this one has a defect in the buckle which prevents it from coming off without a great deal of effort. I was surprised as Bianchi generally makes a quality product. The plastic buckle is the problem--seems flimsy and the small latching arms are less sturdy than earlier belts. Well, at least I don't have to worry that it'll come loose during a scuffle. But, I will in the future select another duty belt. That said, there was no problem with the order or service from Amazon.com."
2,Ruined by Poor Construction,"This plate could be great. The connectors are solid, the two individual plates screw in well to the old construction work box, there is no noticeable drop in sound quality.The problem is with its construction. The holes on the sides to put the wires in (if not using expensive banana clips) are all facing odd angles, no two the same.There are brass grommets to screw the plate into that do not accept the screws sent in the package. I managed to get one thread into each hole before the grommets started spinning. Then I had to forcefully remove the cover, pulling the grommets out. Now I've got this in my wall with no way to put a cover plate on, other than glue, which I will not do.Don't make the mistake I did. Spend the extra money and get something constructed properly."
3,"Challenging, but functional.","It works fine - as any metal connector will. Getting it to look nice on your wall is a bit of a challenge. Each gang has metal reinforcements on the screw holes, and the included screws didn't fit in very well. I had to resort to rather forceful measures. Of course, it's behind furniture anyway, so be it.Anyhow, it serves it's purpose. I'd give it 5 stars if it were a little more innovative than the alternative solutions."
3,Too Small,The material isn't too bad. It is thin and flimsy. Similar to what is already on my truck.Main complaint is the size. It is considerably smaller than the flaps I currently have on my 04 chevy s10 from the dealer. Was hoping they would atleast be a comparable size.I should have measured first. Probably won't be installing these.
3,too simple,Really cheap flaps and that 's what we recieved. The delivery and service was excellent. If interested in simple products this is the one for you. They have not been installed and may not...too cheap.
5,Not a Self Help Book,"Unlike other business books that promise to teach you secrets, Meshel simply tells you what did and didn't work for him. He gives you personal examples, some examples of friends, and explains what worked for them wouldn't have worked for him and why. He really explains what business networking is all about and coupled by the 'golden rule' it seems so simple. I really liked the parts where he discussed maintaining his professional database, and even discussed the new web ones coming out for professional networks."
4,Techniques for building a better life,"The author, Jeff Meshel, demonstrates the importance of relationships in business and how to develop them. In a way, this is the book on developing techniques to build a stable of important relationships. What I have discovered is that these relationships also lead to a more fufulling life because you begin to make friendships beyond your business intentions. The author works with the concept and teaches how, by giving to people, you will receive many times over in the long run. He teaches you how to invest in your business and personal life through networking. It has lead me to discover a whole new life both in business and personal friendships."
1,Changed my business....and Changed my life,"Few things have an immediate impact these days on an individual's business, however, what a difference this book as made in my day-to-day interactions with people who I never thought could help me. Struggles with networking have never been easier to overcome. This is the stuff that your dad would tell you about running a business if he was successful and wanted the same for you. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5,No True Gentleman,"This book has it all, murder, scandal and love. Lady Catherine is caughtbetween protecting her brother and being a proper lady. She plays theroll of investigator herself. She not only finds the kill but true love."
3,slow out of the gate,"This was my first Liz Carlyle novel and I was a little disappointed. The book was a slow start for people who were not familiar with her characters from previous novels. I felt like I needed some kind of program to remind me who everyone was and their relationship to each other. Perhaps I would have been more enthralled if I read her books sequentially. If you are a Liz Carlyle fan this would be a nice treat, for new readers of this author I suggest perhaps reading her other books first."
5,"Smart, witty and fun","This was my first Liz Carlyle and what a wonderful introduction it was. The heroine is smart, funny and very likable. The hero is moody, brooding and oh so sexy--as every romantic hero should be. The other characters who round out the cast are entertaining and interesting in themselves. A good read and I recommend it."
1,Carlyle's worst,"I usually love Liz Carlyle's work but was very disappointed with this effort.There was too much mystery, too many characters and very little romance/ passion. And I hate it when a writer constantly reminds the reader that a character his Italian by constantly having him exclaim ""Dio Mio!"" like a bad extra in the making of ""Titanic'As another reviewer mentioned, the book was only just readable. It is far beneath Carlyl's usual standards. It this was my first Carlyle book, it would have been my last.Fortunately, I know she is capable of so much better. I will just try to erase this one from my memory banks."
5,Great toy for my 7 yr old,"Magnetix is a great toy for kids who are at the age when you are sure they (or younger siblings) are not going to put them in their mouth. I got this for my daughter as a birthday present because she had previously aquired a set of about 15 pcs. from a rummage sale- and didn't put them down all summer. She now spends hours building homes for her little toys, rocket ships, etc. I am considering buying more add-on sets with specialty parts. The onlly bad thing about these is that if you build something too tall or large, the weight pulls it down and the magnets cause it to collapse in on itself. That's a little disappointing, but still worth it- She loves them."
5,Fabulous for entertainment and creativity!,"Our kids received a set of 100 a year ago and my husband has as much, if not more, fun creating many static and moving designs. I bought this 250 piece set for him this year and he just LOVES it! Also bought a kit with helix corner pieces which makes for really different designs. Highly recommended!"
3,"Love the product, not the quantity","If I had known what 250 pieces actually looks like and what can be built, I'm not sure I would have bought this product at that price! It comes in this huge box and along with the packaging it does lend itself to pretty high expectations. On Christmas day when I saw how much it actually was, I wasn't too happy. True, it's actually 250 pieces but please be warned: you may be disappointed if you think that's a whole lot."
3,Runi,It does not have as many poems as other books of Rumi. It is a small book and they are not too many poems of love
3,Bland,Somehow this translation does not inspire or maybe the selection of poems is weak. The magic seems lost here... I would stay with Coleman Barks if you want the real Rumi magic.
5,Does the job,"These cases do the job at holding CDs. However like all slim jewel cases they are subject to break easily, nothing can be done about that."
3,"Great item, poor shipping","These color cases are great for my DVDs with a different color for each genre (suspense, sci-fi, horror, comedy, etc.). They are slim and allow compact storage of CDs or DVDs. I tried ordering them twice from an Amazon vendor and both times they arrived with most of the plastic cases broken or cracked. You can't keep the undamaged ones and return the broken ones, so if even one is broken you have to return the whole pack. I am buying them elsewhere."
2,Not what I expected,"only about a third of the book is telling you about and how to reload, the other two thirds is reloading data and dated to boot! I would not have bought this If I new most of it is reloading data that you can get off the Powder Mfgs website for free. the information is generalized and not to indepth.okay for general use. but I would have spent my money elsewhere.Live and Learn."
2,Look around!,"There are much better ones at lower prices. I know, I own them! I could not recommend this book because I've read older ones that have more quality and lower priced."
5,Sunset Studies - The Greatest,"I have heard some great albums in my time, but Sunset Studies by little known Australian band Augie March is my favourite ever. It is 76 minutes of absolute brilliance that will just take you to that other place like only a few albums can. It took its time to grow on me, but after about six listens i was hooked for life. It is not for people with short attention spans. There is so much depth to the music on this album that it is imposible to take in all at once. The lyrics are incredibly thoughful and poetic and add to the amazing feeling this album gives. Every song on this album is different yet they all link in together to give it that real album feel. Over the past year every song from this album has been my favourite at some point in time, but now i can't decide because they are all so brilliant.In conclusion, if you can handle music that is a bit slow or if you like semi-folk and singer-songwriter music Sunset Studies is an absolute must have album."
3,"Pretty good but not great, but then what did you expect.","This wasn't a bad movie but wasn't very good either. Sybil Danning looked great and the rest of the girls were easy on the eyes but the movie as a whole just seemed to drag on.The disc on the other hand is nice, the movie looks good and sounds good, it also has some nice special features."
5,A valuable book,"As a military man, I am always interested in the people who make up what we call the ""National Command Authority."" And that is why Blackman's book is so valuable. Before reading it, I saw Albright as a cardboard cartoon. But Blackman acts like a life-saving doctor, placing an oxygen mask over the secretary of state, putting the rose into her cheeks, a twinkle into her eyes and showing the real heart of American foreign policy today. A wonderful book!"
1,Overtaken By Events,"Not bad for a ""quickie"" book on Albright, but it has now been overtaken by a new biography by the Washington Post reporter who first broke the story of Madeleine Albright's jewish origins. the new book, ""Madeleine Albright"" by Michael Dobbs, is better written, better researched, and does a better job of relating her actions as secretary of state to her previous life. Blackman's book substitutes giggly celebrity-worship for serious analysis."
1,Ugh!,"I had hoped for a compelling portrait of an interesting leader -- but instead found Blackman droning on about Albright's parents. She is not Robert Caro, that's for sure."
2,Didn't even make it through the sample,"So I saw someone ranting that they thought The HELP was TERRIBLE and to read The View from Delphi instead because it was better. I will never find out why or how. The Help grabbed me on page one. The sample for this book is about 5 or 6 chapters that never gave me a want or a need to get to know the characters. Hazel is mildly interesting but having finished the sample, I don't really have any desire to dig deeper and find out what happens to her."
2,"The Help, but not as good...","I tried to like this book. I read the entire thing and kept waiting for it to be what I wanted it to be based on other reader reviews. I have to say, I was a bit disappointed in the characters and the story, which never seemed to evolve in the way I would have expected. It reminded me of The Help on many levels, but not on the same level. It was flat and contrived."
4,"Great book, disappointing ending","Without explaining much of the plot here, I really enjoyed this book, its setting, characters, and importance of the time period. The author weaves many plot devices and creates memorable characters, but I felt the ending (without giving away spoilers) didn't tie up all the loose ends, and also was too clean of an ending. The entire book delves into race relations in the South, in a time when there was no justice, yet the end of the book leaves the reader with that happy-go-lucky feeling of everything working out just fine and everyone getting their just desserts as appropriate. I find that a little ""white-washed."" A book doesn't always need a happy ending, just a resolution. This one needed a more realistic ending to truly drive home the theme of social injustice.That being said, I still highly recommend this book and its importance in creating even the slightest glimpse into a dark history of our own past."
5,Great TV Show.,"While I prefer the movies made about Zatoichi these TV Shows were done along the same lines as the movies were. Shintaro Katsu has to be my favorite of the Zatoichi actors. And I hope to one day have the full collection of all of his rolls as this fine social avenger for the poor and needy back then in feudal Japan. Even though he wasn't blind he acted with such realism as to make you believe that he actually was blind. And I think that is what makes his movies so captivating to watch. For those of you that have not yet seen any of his movies I recommend viewing the first three movies first. Then watch the others and do not miss ""The Chess Player"" or ""The Cane"" because they are two of my favorites. All in all this man devoted his whole life to making sure that the world realized that the Japanese people are just like any other race of men on this planet of ours. And for that I give the man my praise and my thanks for a job well done."
5,"Good work, but C. Taylor needs updating","No human being who is able should miss anything Zatoichi. There is no film after the 1960s that has escaped influence from the film and television series.But now an error must be corrected in a previous review by C. Taylor. Miramax has officially informed me, via letter, that MIRAMAX does NOT own the rights to the Zatoichi film episode 14, known to fans as ""Zatoichi's Pilgrimage"". This film, never released commercially in the West, has been released in Japan.The news leaves us unsure whether we will see a DVD of ""Pilgrimage"" any time soon. MIRAMAX refuses to confirm or deny any other allegations."
1,Not a long lasting product,"My plastic egg tray lasted about a year (with use about once a week) until it disintegrated. When Santa left this on my doorstep, I gave away my grandmother's old reliable West Bend that had an aluminum tray... Oh I wish I had it back. If you use an egg cooker frequently, (and like to wash it up after each use)... find another unit. The only reason I'm writing this review is that I'm trying to find a good egg cooker. Stay away from this one."
1,Do NOT waste your money !,I bought this egg cooker about 1 1/2 or 2 years ago. It worked fine the first 6 month but now the plastic where you put your eggs in is broken and water boils over so that the eggs turn out halfcooked !Never again would I purchase another one like this !
1,Poor quality,"This cooker's only good point is its small size that takes up less space than the other egg cookers I've found. Other than that, it's pretty much a piece of junk. I had to experiment A LOT with the amount of water to use, as the suggested amounts always left the eggs undercooked. The plastic tray that holds the eggs split at the seam after only a few uses, and now water leaks out all around the cooker. Avoid this one! I'm throwing mine in the trash!"
5,I was carried away by Carried Away,What a fun read. A real Blast. Loved the characters and thought the story line was fun. Lots of laughter and lovin'. I really enjoyed this book but then all of Donnas' books are so great. I have read everything she has written and look forward to each and every book she publishes. WOW what a writer. I am constantly surprised by the different styles she can write. Everything from paranormal to sexy hot Blaze books. If you have not read this author you MUST ....Thanks again Donna for another fun read.Another reader in Florida...or where ever I am at the time...
5,Warm Chuckles and Helpful Ah-has,"As a mom of five, it's so great to find an author who understands my sprint. Dena Dyer has put together a dynamite book of motherly meditations. Moms, grab your latte (though we all know most busy mothers have to settle for a quick half-cup of luke warm instant coffee-like-product) and pick up GRACE FOR THE RACE. You'll find warm chuckles and some helpful ""ah-ha"" moments as you head for the finish. Great book!"
3,Not helpful to the already polite businessperson.,This is a useful text if given to new young employees as required reading or to a problem employee as a wake-up call.I don't recommend this book for an already conscientious person who wants to learn more specific points of etiquette. A guide tailored to a specific region is more useful if you'd like to know more about business protocols in different countries.
2,Marginally useful,"When I read an etiquette book, I want information about how to comply with the myriad arbitrary social conventions and rituals that people have. However, this book and others like it, often fail to recall such relevant details very comprehensively, and often deal mostly in obvious generalities.Worse yet, the author makes the common mistake of indulging in moral panic, decrying the death of civility etc. (I suppose people prone to haranguing people with this stuff are usually the ones most likely to write about etiquette.) You're not Aristotle. Don't teach me about the nature of virtue, just tell me where to put my fork. Thank you."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for anyone that wants to go on in the business world","I bought this book a few years ago when I was first interviewing for internships. This book teaches the essentials of etiquette in a quick and easy format. I had received this book two days before my first interview and it allowed me to ""improve"" myself in that short amount of time. A MUST HAVE for anyone that wants to improve themself quickly."
1,Blah,"I wasn't impressed. Sage's voice wasn't at all the same, the story was retarded, nothing at all like the original series. I was disappointed."
5,Just as Good as L'Occitane,I love the L'Occitane Amber incense (believe it's discontinued) and this is identical to it -- yet a FRACTION of the price! You will not be disappointed.
4,Almost there,"This is a great product for any DC fan. The only issue that may be had is a desire for more. Many less well known and darker characters are left out, also seemingly no character within Vertigo are present. Still a great buy."
3,"DC, I still don't get them.","I am a marvel fan. I like DC, but I am not a die hard fan. DC is fantasy. Marvel less fantasy.(At least after that 90's weirdness.)I love Batman and Superman, but the rest of the DC Universe is out three. In the Justice League cartoon, Doomsday was just an alien who wanted a fight. According to this Encyclopedia, he was created on Krypton (Which makes his body able to kill Superman) and was sent into space in a suit he could not escape from. He lands on Earth and spends hundreds of years trying to break free. He finallly does and digs his way to surface. Instead of celebrating, he kills Superman. Wow! Get this book if you like things like this. Personally, DC leaves a bad taste and I can only take so much at one time."
1,Where are they?,"I can remember when comics were ""big"". There are some you never hear of today,suchas: Johnny Quick(he has to repeat a formula in order to change from a professor to Johnny Quick);Airboy(he had a airplane that had wing that would flap just like a bird):The Heap(sort of like a huge hairy hulk):Mr. America(had a red or orange suit);Blackhawk(had a group of different nationalities and a oriental side kick called ""chop chop""). DOES ANYBODY ELSE RECALL THESE 'SUPER HEROS'/"
3,Encyclopedia is the wrong word.,"Let's get real, here. To do an all-comprehensive encyclopedia of DC's entire character roster and their histories would be almost impossible. There's no way all that information could fit into one book. Having said that, I think DC bit off more than they could chew. Only the big characters, such as Superman and Batman, get double-page spreads. All the smaller characters get maybe two or three paragraphs at best. I really can't call this a reference book. I applaud the authors for their effort, just don't put too much expectations on this book."
1,This looks like a job for EDITORMAN!,"I didn't mind the blatant exclusions in this ""encyclopedia"" or the unusual focus on some characters (Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen) over others (Jim Gordon, Alfred Pennyworth), but they could have hired a proofreader before going to press. The numerous typos, omissions and factual errors grew annoying the farther into the book I got. Major events were glossed over, characters were omitted and the art selection was haphazard and poorly executed.All-in-all, I would rather have a bound edition of the Who's Who magazines that DC released in the 80's. At least it seemed like they cared enough about that product to proofread it, as opposed to this substandard effort.I give it one star solely because of the beautiful Alex Ross dustjacket."
3,Who's Who in hardcover,"While the DC Comics Encyclopedia can be very useful in tracking down obscure old characters currently appearing in DC's ""52"" event (it has entries for Devilance the Pursuer, Beefeater and The Inferior Five, for example), it's not really an ""encyclopedia"" in the truest sense of the term. If you wanted to look up information, for example, on important DC Universe locales you might find a paragraph or two on Opal City and a page on Metropolis, but ultimately anything besides just characters finds itself limited to a two-page spread (Teams, Vehicles, etc). The result is that this book is not so much the encyclopedia I was hoping for as it is an updated (as of 2002) version of DC's landmark 1980s series ""Who's Who."" It's a useful resource, make no mistake, but ultimately not someplace you can go to find out about S.T.A.R. Labs or get a chart of cabinet positions during the Luthor Administration. For those things, you need the Internet."
4,Like it,"Received this timely. However, there was a tear on the cover. It still serves its purpose, but a little disappointed because I take care of my books."
4,Quite extensive but...,This Encyclopedia is quite extensive and its very nice for somebody like me that isnt a huge fan. However they do tend to brush over some characters that perhaps should have more time dedicated to them
4,Exactly what ordered..,So happy to get what you ordered. It was a Christmas present and the recepient liked it a lot. Happy happy.
3,Good and Bad,"I understand the frustrations of C. Galdieri. Because of the Crisis there are literally tons of characters in this book that simply don't exist anymore, and there are many other very lame characters who will never be seen again.However, if they weren't there this wouldn't be a complete collection and that's what DC was driving for. Completism. The entire history, the entire wacky, upside-down, topsy-turvy, ridiculous, and yet often magical, historical, status-quo changing, risk-taking, violent, and iconic history of the DC Universe.My big hangup? No individual mention of John Constantine. (Hellblazer!) That's unforgivable."
4,Good by for fans,"Good information and very nice to see descriptions of some of the lesser knowns. Helps clear up some things about continuity, but summaries seem brief for the main characters."
4,value,Dc comics encyclopedia was great value for money for a hard cover. Amazing animation with all the characters that I remember and more I didnt
5,Best Book Price!!!!!!,"Thanks Amazon, Saved a-lot of $$$$$, by purchasing from you instead of our local Barnes and Noble. Plus the outer jacket on the book was not torn as it was at Barnes and Noble. Wish you could have seen my grandson, when he opened the box. Sheer delight."
4,Good Fun,I am glade i finally picked up this book. But the first two items i looked up were absent from the Encyclopedia. First nothing on Watchmen a passing mention would of been nice.Second The Wonder Twins are completely absent from the book which took me by surprise.over all a fun Coffee table book to show off to friends.
5,Awesome information,"I really didn't know what to expect when I bought this book. It was just something to help me figure out who some of the characters were in the DC universe. What I found was a history of EVERY character DC has ever created! There were some really obscure characters in there dating back to the 1940s that I had never even heard of.If you're into DC comics, it's well worth the price. I know I've had hours of fun reading the different entries on not only the characters I knew but many I didn't."
3,A very good try...,"As a fan of DC comics and a collector of its 'Who's Who' series from way back I was very pleased to see a large, hardbound encyclopaedia of the DC Universe. Flipping through it at my local bookseller's left me pretty pleased with the work overall and so I purchased it to go over in more detail later. The Devil, as they say, is in the details. Going over the book more closely the reality of a work this size hit home: they missed quite a number of characters (some obscure, others not so obscure) and the formatting left something to be desired. I'm an old-school fan, pre-Crisis in many senses, and some of my favorites were simply not there; any version of The Harlequin (NOT Harley Quinn), a number of the less-used members of the Titans (Teen, New or otherwise), just to mention a few. I recommend this book for the artwork, primarily, and for -most- of the information contained therein. With word of a second printing, I'm hopeful that then next one will have more space."
4,A fun way to view DC's history,"Using the encyclopedia format to look at the myriad characters created over the course of DC Comics history is a clever and fun idea. Illustrated with art from a variety of time periods and treating the characters as if they actually existed, the authors have created a book that is valuable for any fan of comics. Little known characters, events that might have been missed, and some fairly obscure references combine with the well-known mainstays of the DC Universe (Superman, Batman, et.al.) to make for a fairly comprehensive history. Sure, there are a number of errors in listing heroes and villains, illustrations not showing the character being discussed, and even details about the characters that will not satisfy the fan looking for perfection, but for the fan who just wants a concise way of looking at the characters of a company that has been around since the 1930's, this is an enjoyable read."
4,"It is great, but wheres Constantine?!?","You have Swamp Thing, you have the Sandman, you have Death, you even mention John as one of the great team ups (with the Swamp Thing) but Constantine doesnt have an entry of his own? Come on!In reality the DC Comics Encyclopedia is a great resource, I recently recieved it as a gift and I love it. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is that it has a few strange omissions and here and there the information seems lacking. Overall its a great effort and a worth addition to your library, be it as a reference guide to the DCU or simply as a coffee table book with a fantastic Alex Ross cover.Recommended. :)"
3,Fans will want to read back stories,"This was a attempt to explain who is (or was) a part ofDC's latest time line but it will make fans crave to seethe untold back stories.For example, Kathy Kane, is now presented as circus performerwho helped Batman and Robin in crime figthing. Yet, thisKathy Kane was NOT The Batwoman. It seems out of place thatthe grim version of Batman we have been given would allow amere woman to assist him. Sadly, Kathy was still killedby the League of Assassins.. but why? By whom? This is anexample of a character, whose story is told in this book, needsto be fleshed out in flashbacks.The 1959 version of Supergirl is pretty much brushed off and hasanyone noticed DC's relish in killing off female charactersin the last 3 decades or so. The males come back from thedead but the ladies...????? I was amazed to read how manyheroines were tagged ""deceased"" in this book."
3,Oopsie!,In the encyclopedia which is excellent otherwise there are several spoilers for future events for characters that HAVEN'T been published yet!It is disappointing that D.C. didnt have better editorial review processes on the proofreading staff to prevent just this such event.The biggest example of this occurrence is that a character who hasnt been killed in the current comics is revealed to die soon. Such a spoiler is soemthing that should never have made it onto the published page.
4,Can't Have Everything,"I enjoyed the book. Yes, there are some characters missing. However, I don't think you can include EVERYTHING. Some things just fall through the cracks. Overall and for the most part, this is a very good text for the DC Universe. And with the way the comic universe changes, you can't put everything in a one volume text. This book came out before Infinite Crisis. Look what that did to the DC Universe."
5,Beautiful,"This top is beautiful. It is flattering in all of the right places, doesn't ""hide"" a baby bump - but it fits well and is really comfortable. Can be dressed up or dressed down - worn often. Love it. (I'm tall - 5'9"" and typically a size 4-6)."
4,Fundamental Orthopedic,Great transaction! I didn't pay for extra fast shipping and got it in the allowed amount of time.
2,Excessive,"I think this book is excessive in the amount of information presented. It goes from straight, forward information to difficult to understand technical biochemical information that is not needed for PTA's. It is wordy, using quotes that are unnecessary, if not out of place, for learning the information. If it stuck to the basics and explained it well it would make for a less laborious reading. I am a first year PTA student and I have to read this book. I tend to go to my A & P book that presents the information in an easier to understand format."
3,Works well for small amount of buildup,"My friend's decanters are disgusting, so I bought these beads to help him clean it. I think if the sediment had not been baked on by years of buildup, the beads would have worked better."
3,not bad,not a horrable game harder than i thought it would be decent graphics absolutly not for younger kid but non of the outlaw games are
5,Terrific Book!,This is a very concise and informational book about immigration in the early 20th Century. I learned a lot from this book and suspect my students will too.
4,I learned so much,My nine year old daughter read this book for a book test that she had to take at school and fell in love with it. But the title is ...If Your Name Was Changed at Ellis Island and there is only two pages out of 80 that mention about that. But a wonderful book. I recommend ages 7-12 to read this book. I hope my review helped you. One more thing if your child or children don't read long books don't get it because it is 80 pgs. It took my daughter only two days though. I hope you enjoy it.
2,"Creative, but fell short on expectations.","Having watched her filmography in reverse, this project does not compare to the better funded and more experienced films of the present. But it was interesting to watch the beginnings of a very good film director's career. Deepa showed that she would not be anchored down by the bindings of some eastern cultures."
2,Horrid attempt at Parody,"This was meant to be a parody of Bollywood and Hollywood movies, mostly Bollywood, but the effect was horrid. Bollywood lovers can easily identify the basic elements: song and dance, necessary love obstacle and a few other nuances. But the film ruined the parody by explaining them with subtitles like ""DEVDAS: tragic Bollywood Hero"". Bollywood lovers have seen Devdas and don't need explanations, and it seems to confuse non-Bollywood fans. It also tried to take a jab at wholesome Bollywood by centering the story around a rich guy who falls in love with a fabulous girl who is really a prosititute. To an Indian, that's dodgy material. Non-Bollywood fans would think, ""They're just copying Pretty Woman."" So you've lost both audiences.I understand Deepa Mehta's intent behind this film, but it misfired. She should stick to those profound dramas she's known for making."
3,"Bollywood takeoff on ""Pretty Woman"" and movies themselves...","Don't take it too seriously. This nonsensical parody has a lot of the trappings of my favorite Bollywood films: sense of humor, twisted plot, overacting, bright colors and fun music. Yet, somehow Bollywood-Hollywood loses me. I could barely finish the film, but kept replaying ""Bride and Prejudice"" (the first Bollywood film I saw) over and over again like a kid with their first Disney film."
3,"Does the job, with a little extra work though","This was my first vibrator so I don't really have a reference point. I was really excited to try one for the first time, but it was a little bit of a let down. I had to do a lot of extra manuevering to get the right effect and I think the rabbit ears are much too long, however very sensational. I will keep using it but hope to find something better that works more for me than me for it. Hope this helped someone!"
2,Works ok but...,it shreds but not to good because all some has to do is piece the shredded long strands back together!...not good to shred sensitive information on this one and not worth the price!
3,pretty good,This product works good except if used continuously for a while--it overheats and you have to wait for it to cool down to start using it again--can be a pain.
2,Not the stuff piping is made of!,"This recording is generally of poor quality, both in sound and in the base level of bagpiping itcontains. I would not recommend it to anyone who plays the bagpipe at any level ofexpertise. It may have some appeal to those who do not understand the instrument orperhaps to those who just want to hear band music for the noise submitted..Overall, although it was inexpensive, it is a poor recording jn any way, shape or form.It is a shame that some Pipe Bands of the British Army have their names attached to it."
5,my review after 1 month's use,This is the best cordless telephone system I have owned. I previously had an AT&T 2.4 system and was not happy with the interference or the comfort of the actual phone against my head when talking. I looked at the Uniden system but did not like the workmanship quality or comfort feel in my hand. I think anyone who purchases this system will be completely satisfied.
5,Panasonic KX-TG5634M,"This cordless answering system is meeting all of myexpectations. Amazon's price of $160 was certainly betterthan Best Buy at $224 for the system that did not have FHSS. Although Amazon had to back order, it was worth the wait for the savings. I hope the numbers on the number pad continue to work on this unit for a longer time than on my previous unit. That was my only issue about a previous Panasonic unit. Since I have some hearing difficulties this unit makes it very easy to hear and understand. So far so good."
4,Grreat Phone,I don't recall how much I paid for this phone system but no way would I spend $400 on a phone set. The performance is outstanding and would recommend this quality product to others.
2,Disapointing Panasonic Product,"Picked this up to reduce interference on my home wireless network. I've always had exceptional performance from all of my Panasonic consumer electronics purchases. Phone works well, reception good, features broad and well thought out. However! two of the four handsets failed in the first 60 days of use, and I'm having a more difficult time getting them replaced or repaird that I would have thought."
2,No luck with Panasonic,"Twice, i got burned by panasonic phones. They seem so good, but then you realize the drawbacks after you buy it. Never again. overpriced. junk."
4,Panasonic KX-TG5634M 5.8 GHz,"It is a nice phone, but previous writers are correct aobut not being able to put it on a wall and have the handset not fall. Also, some writers wrote that the keypads do not light up. For some reason the when bought in the US this is correct. I checked locally to find that Future shop sells them with a lighted keypad. They are the same model number and everything but one lights up and the other doesn't."
3,"Good Quality, but missing necessary features","Good voice quality, but these expandable phones are missing few very necessary features.1. Each handset has own phonebook and need to sync other handsets manually and one at a time instead of all.2. Same thing with caller-id. New call is individual call on each handset. Reviewing one handset will not sync other handsets."
1,Panasonic Cordless Phone,One of the phones fell 2 feet to the floor and hasn't worked since. Why do they make phones so sensitive. Everone has droped their phone from one time to another.... Dissatisfied!
1,book purchase,"I have not yet received my order. It is past due to arrive. I have contacted the seller, and received a promt reply that the book has been shipped. I hope to have it soon, and trust that it is on the way."
5,A Young Heart with Ancient Wisdom,There is no better mirror than a child's honesty. Amazing poetry that sings songs of glory for the truly wonderous parts of life.
1,Pity Perfect,"Young Mattie is seeing angels again and this time his handlers are too busy cashing his royalty checks and bowling with Oprah and Maya Angelou to double down on the lovable moppets meds.Besides they might interfere with his book tours and t.v. appearances.""Journey Through Hearstsongs"" is Pity Publishing at its exploitative worst in a politically correct arena that would have made P.T.Barnum green with envy.As seen in reveiws here Mattie is just a hangnail away from being hailed as the greatest writer this side of Chekov if only members of Oprahs bookclub had ever stumbled into a library and accidentally discovered classical literature."
5,Wise Words From An Old Soul,"This author's simple words convey complex, universal truths that one might expect from a sage or spiritual guru, not from a person who has lived only 12 years. That's the beauty of Mattie...through poetry and artwork, he shows us that consciousness, attitude, faith and optimism are far more important on the jouney of life than what a person looks like or how much money is in his bank account. (Corporate America and Madison Avenue...are YOU listening?) Moreover, the most profound lesson Mattie teaches is that peace is possible only when it becomes the predominant attitude of the so-called peacemaker, a truth that our world leaders would be well-served to memorize. In the midst of global terrorism, threats of war, spiritual and physical hunger, he shows us what's really important."
2,"I Know This May Be The Unpopular Opinion, But...","Look, I'm very, very sorry that the kid is sick. I know people with debilitating diseases, and I know how hard it is. He has all my sympathy. And I am also glad he found a way to take away some of his pain thru' writing. It's good for himBut...That does not mean the kid is a good poet! When I read a work of poetry, I read it for the work of poetry itself, not for the author's life story! Poetry should be about talent, and about the actual poem. I know this may make me seem heartless and callous, but...if the kid was not sick, would he be getting all these book deals? But, if you like corny, little-kid poems that I'm sure ANY 11 year old can write, than I reccommend this book. It may be all heart-warming, but it should not be considered good poetry.*I gave the book two stars to show I am not totally without feeling. I do feel bad for the kid and I wish him well."
5,Made me think about The Child Whisperer by Matt Pasquinilli,"reading this book I was reminded of The Child Whisperer by Matt Pasquinilli. I bought The Child Whisperer ... a few months ago, and I have reread it severaltimes since. I am on my second reading of Journey Through Heartsongs - thistime with a notepad to jot down all the great and useful ideas."
1,the jeep bike that couldn't,"This bike looked really cool and seemed even greater when we pulled it out of the box, all shiny and new. Then, after getting all put together and reading the instructions carefully for 2 hours, just before it was ready to hit the road we saw it. The front rim....ugh. Yes, it was bent pretty bad. So instead of sending us a new rim they wanted the whole bike back. It was easy enough to return, although it did take up part of the day packaging it back up and running it to UPS. It seems to me it owuld have just been easier to send a new rim. So we scrapped the whole bike on the net and decided to go to a real bike shop."
3,Plant Food,"I'm wondering how this product differs from plant food. LiquidHumate-Extract is used by gardeners and farmers.Google: Fulvic Acid extracted from humateIt's all so very interesting... connecting the dots ;-)~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*Liquid Humate-Extract is sold by many farm and garden centers such as:OrganicMinedMinerls (dot) com Lots of interesting info. - tiny snippet:""Liquid Humate-Extract is a very unique organic material that aids in the chelating of micro/macro nutrients into a more available form for plant use; helps develop deep root systems; provides fuel for microbial activity; improves plant's health and ability to resist disease.""~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*Article:Effects of Humic Acid on Animals and HumansAn Overview of Literatureand a Review of Current ResearchFrom: humichealth (dot)info (forward slash) effects* Lots to think about, research and discuss ;-)"
2,Mineral,"I am not sure how to rate this product. I don't feel any different when I take it. I just know it has minerals and that I feel good about putting nutrients in my body. I do a combination of things to keep myself healthy, so I can't point to one specific thing."
3,Mixed Feellings,"I have been wanting to experiment with supplementing of trace minerals and this product seemed to fit the bill. It claims to have quite a range of minerals and the price was appealing. That said, I didn't experience any boost of energy as is suggested by the product description and I am a bit disappointed in the fact that this contains iron for which I certainly don't need any more supplementation. My personal iron levels are already high and I really don't need or want even more. Problem is that all of these liquid mineral supplements seem to contain iron. If I can't find something else without iron I will have to reluctantly go to capsules instead of liquid. That aside, the Morningstar Minerals taste fine and I found it easy to take."
3,Somewhat Skeptical,"I received the Morningstar Minerals Energy Boost today. I've taken mineral supplements in the past and there was always a strong taste to them and they were dark in color. This does taste like water and looks like well-water, w/o the rusty taste. Not much of a bite to it at all. I've read the reviews, but I'll give it a few days to see if I feel any different. So far, I'm skeptical that something that tastes so much like water has all the minerals and benefits it claims to have. My husband will be taking it too, so I'll let you know if it works any different for him. Then there will be 2 opinions instead of one."
1,Save your money,"I'm super pi$$ed that I spent money on this way overpriced item. Maybe it does contain all the minerals it says it does, but I do not feel any energy boost whatsoever. I'm assuming the extremely positive reviews are from people that are not real."
5,Easy to take and healthy too!,"This product is tasteless, clean, and easy to swallow. There is no after taste to worry about so you won't dread taking it."
1,Not a good pick,"This is not what you want to buy if you want to see action, art or music. This is a documentary that doesn't do justice to the spectacular group. Hardly any sequence represents the true escence of the acts because they are very few and interrupted. The editing is poor. The content is mostly interviews."
3,More expensive than it should be,"I bought this CD because my daughter's daycare had it, and they said she loved the title track. The songs are fun and interactive for preschool-aged children, and she seems to really like it. I don't know that the quality of the music is that great (Miss Carole's voice is a little annoying), but that could just be me. I'm still not sure why it was more expensive than most other CDs out there."
3,Lt. Ellen Ripley,"I bought this figure simply because I never had it when I was growing up with this toyline. Ripley comes with her famous flame thrower weapon, a mini comic book and some sticker decals that you can place on her or the weapon, whichever you choose. Articulation wise, since its a Kenner brand figure, doesn't do much other than her legs moving up and down, arms up and down, head and waist side to side. The figure is okay and I thought maybe a little more detail to it would of made it really good. Or maybe a better choice of clothing that would have matched her movie counterpart. This figure looks more like a ""cartoon"" than the actual Ripley from ALIENS. If you really like the franchise and are a fan, I'd say go for it and buy this figure. If you're not, than don't waste your dough. It's not a terrible figure but I think it just could have had more appeal to it."
5,much better than Gone With the Wind,I fell in love with this book and thought that I should read Goned With the Wind afterwards. GWTW was not nearly as good. The detail and story telling was amazing. I would love to own a copy of this book.
5,Ranks with Gone With the Wind.,I believe the author is related to James Longstreet - and covers him in detail. Good account of Gettysburg - southern perspective on Lincoln is excellent - good plot twist -
5,"THE COMPLETE SUN SINGLES, VOL 4.","THIS IS VOL 4 OF A 6 VOLUME SET. BEAR FAMILY ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS UN-SURPASSED. THIS 4 DISC SET COMES IN AN ALBUT SIZED BOX (12X12) WITH A WELL-WRITTEN BOOK WITH PHOTOS OF EACH SELECTION. IF YOU LIKE SUN RECORDS, I RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE 6 VOLUMES. THIS IS NO JUST A PICK OF TITLES BUT THE WHOLE 45/78 RPM CATALOGUE OF EVERY SIDE!"
4,Good back-up weapon,"This was the very first airsoft gun I ever got. I have to say, it's an excellent gun for a first-timer. Now that I've moved up to bigger, better, and more powerful guns, I only use this as my weapon to play with my neighbors (because all they've got are electrics like this one). But in ""real"" combat, I carry this around as a back-up/last resort weapon. I also it use it if someone is really close so I can hit them and not waste ammo from my good guns. At any rate, this gun can fire .12 gram bbs about 25 feet and still be relatively accurate. If you're good with pistols, this gun isn't bad. I happen to be good with pistols. If you suck at airsoft and need to fire off as many shots as you can to hit someone, don't get this gun. But hey, it sures beats a spring pistol (although it's not quite as fun or real-looking)."
1,crap,Pros: Nice looking and comes with a extra clip so you won't run out of ammoCons: [...]$ Has really poor accuracy and it only fires about 137 fps and after 10 feet the ammo curves and its easy to jamOverall: Don't buy this gun its really weak and theres really nothing good about it. I can't even hit a target from 10 feet away its so bad so go with me on this one and buy a much nicer semi auto pistol than this crap
3,Ok for the price.,Not as strong as I thought it would be. Maybe I am expecting too much but one of the bits broke long before I felt is should have.
3,not a good book for beginers,This book has a lot of great origami but it is not a good book for beginners. Once I know what I am doing this will be a great book.
3,"Origami for ""Some"" People","This book is only for everybody with either one of the following:1. incredible, massive amounts of patience 2. lots of folding experienceIt certainly is not for beginners! I'm not a complete novice, having successfully folded every single box found in ""Origami Boxes"" by Tomoko Fuse. And they came out very nicely, thank you.What Origami Omnibus is lacking is detailed instructions on how to fold the various designs. One minute you're going along fine, the next minute you're like ""WHAT?"" - the pictures suddenly become impossible to follow, unless you are experienced in interpreting hieroglyphics.For people with highly developed 3-D brains only.If this book were called ""Advanced Origami"" it would be more appropriate.Granted, the book has some lovely, brilliant designs in it, if only you can fold them!Beginners, if you buy this book and are completely baffled, don't despair. Origami can be very rewarding, you just need a book with more detail."
4,Good book!,"We are enjoying the book. The projects are different and easy to recreate within a few tries. At some places though, the instructions are not very clear and requires quite a bit of trial and error before you understand what the Author is saying."
4,Great for what it is.,"If you wanna know what it's like to see Stanhope live, this is the DVD to have. The sound and video quality aren't great at times, but this is a perfect snapshot of his actual live show. If you're new to Stanhope, I wouldn't start here, I'd suggest the most recent Showtime special he did. After you're familiar with him, definitely check this one out."
5,Stanhope Rules,I love Doug Stanhope and this is a great DVD. I have seen him live about 5 times and this live DVD is true to life.
4,Great stuff!,"If you like Doug Stanhope, definitely check this one out. It's not as good as some of his other material, but it's something any Stanhope fan should have."
4,Great reference book,"This book has very helpful descriptions of many of Texas's native plants. I was a bit suprised to see a full-page picture of a Saguaro cactus gracing the cactus section, though!"
4,Quilting For People Who Still Don't Have Time To Quilt,"Sipmle srtaight forward instructions, but not lacking in inspiration for us beginers. I liked it enough to buy a second one for my daughter when she decided to start quilting."
3,Suitable only for mathematicians,"Don't be mislead by Hawking's popular works, this is a book by a mathematician written for mathematicians. Unless you studied mathematics to at least graduate level (you need to understand vector calculus, vector spaces and tensors to get anywhere) you are unlikely to get much from this book. Even then to read it at anything other than the most superficial level is very hard work. However even at the superficial level it gives one insights into some interesting aspects of general relativity."
2,The trays crack very easily.,"I completely agree with Jon Tulloch. Unless you're buying these cases for the top and bottom pieces, you should look elsewhere. The very first tray I tried to remove from the bottom piece, cracked at the corner! Now, I've done this dozens (if not hundreds) of times; not one tray had ever cracked. The material used in these cases appears to be lighter and thinner than standard, resulting in a flimsy case. Of course, just because this product has the same name as the product another customer has purchased, it doesn't mean they are the same product. It's entirely possible that this product was made more sturdily in the past, and it's been cheapened to save money (like so many other products). This could explain the different experiences reported by different customers."
1,Cheap crap!,Want a pile of cheap cracked cd cases. Ya know memorex i did plan on putting my inserts in the case as well. It's like clock work trying to open one of these up with out it cracking.
4,8 out of 10 isn't bad,"It seems like most jewel cases are fragile, and I had several CD's with broken cases. When these replacements showed up, two of the ten new cases were broken too. I still had enough to fix my CD's but they're pretty cheap. 4 of 5 stars is the same 80% useful cases I got, so that seems fitting."
2,At least 1/3 arrived cracked,I've ordered this item 4 times and always get about 1/3 cracked upon arrival. I'm not ordering this item anymore. The cases that are not cracked are pretty great.
3,memorex jewel cases,of the 10 jewel cases in the package 1 was crackbut still useable. but I'm sure that it will brakeafter a couple of times of open & closing of the case.I just did not want to take the time to return thepackage so I just through it away.
3,Great product - Amazon is a Huge shipping rip off though.,"It is a very basic item - Memorex CD/DVD jewel cases with clear tray, we just couldn't find them in stores. We were only finding the slim cases. Anyway, the product is fine - everything is as it should be. We will DEFINITELY NOT purchase this (or anything else) from Amazon! Shipping for this item and the other item came to just about as much as the actual merchandise! It is completely outrageous! We will just go to the source (Amazon was listing these items for other sellers who have online stores)."
5,Excellent replacement CD cases,"After our last overseas move, we found that careless packers had thrown all our CDs together in a box, w/o any padding or wrapping. This resulted in ~30 cracked cases. I was happy that I could buy this pack of 10 to try (vs 100). They worked really well, so I bought 2 more packs to finish the job.I would say that the quality/thickness of the cases is similar to what you get with new CD's now. Some of the older (cracked) cases that I replaced were definitely thicker, but were also slightly yellowing from age. I was very pleased with the quality of this product. (I'm even considering buying another pack to keep on hand as spares...)The only caveat I would add is that it can be tricky to remove the tray (in order to put the artwork in the back). I didn't crack any of the trays doing it, though. Once I got the hang of it, it was quite easy (though my thumbnails definitely suffered as a result!) :-)Wish Amazon carried the same product line with a double jewel case!"
1,"Horribly cheaply made, breaks on opening","I felt compelled to write this note because of the horrible quality of these cases. Out of the ten, three broke just by opening the case for the first time. Five others broke at the hinge in the next four days, after opening them a couple of times. Absurd."
4,"goody, goody, goody","What can I say they were jewel cases for cd's. It was delivered very rapidly. The product itself showed not one scratch, and I was able to replace some cd cases with newer ones. The shipper of these cases did a wonderful job getting them to me."
4,They are nice,They got here fast and look just like you want them to. The only problem is the way they placed them in the box. They were right up against the side of the box and the jewel case closest to the side of the box was crushed. Other than that they are real nice.
2,Not that good.,When I started researching information about day trading this was the first book that I bought. If you are interested in day trading you may find some parts of the book usefull. There are some interviews that are kind of good. The rest is outdated. But if you are a beginner I would sugest that you read Market Wizards or Reminisences of a Stock Operator to get the feel of what it really takes to succeed in this hard but rewarding business.
3,Outdated,"I bought this book right around the time when the internet bubble was about to burst. At that time, the information in this book helped me get a clear view of the steps to take in order to get started in the business of stock trading. The problem with this book today is that the information is outdated.If you are looking into books on trading, the information in this book will not help you. Some companies like Datek which Carol Troy mentions a lot in this book don't even exist anymore (Datek was bought by Ameritrade). Therefore, if you are a newcomer this book might confused you.I have nothing against Carol Troy. I think that her writing is very interesting. I am just saying that anyone who is looking into books on trading (not an easy task), will benefit from more well known books."
5,Great Day Trader Intro and beyond book,I am new to the stock market and read this book in one sitting. It is a great read with tons of resources and places to go on the internet. She helps you with research and how to buy with her formula to keep you out of trouble. I look forward to her next book
3,Best local coverage,Are you or your children interested in playing in chess tournaments? This magazine has all the upcoming events listed and you can follow your results and have games published. Your subscription also helps fund local events and promotions!
2,Predictable; writing not very challenging,"The plot was too obvious from the beginning. Even after I tried to imagine it as a metaphor for writing (the woman/writer with a story to tell, the overbearing priest serving as the conscious that says it's not worth it), it still failed miserably. I was really looking forward to a good story but was severely disappointed by the predictability of the plot, the characters, and the good guy riding to the rescue."
2,what age group is this written for?,"Surely it is too long for YA reading, but the writing is too simple for sophisticated reading.No matter how interesting the events in the book may have been, the writing was predictable and bland, rendering the novel unreadable."
4,A worthwhile read,"I picked this book up at the library after having read some of the author's other books and was impressed by the consistency of her work. The main character, Margaret, leads a rather motley and charmed life in unusual times with unusual friends. What takes this book away from the danger of being formulaic is the detail and craftsmanship with which the book was made. If you are looking for a book with a strong female lead character and an interesting plot, this is a good choice."
5,A little view,i was surprised to find that no one really liked this book best out of her books. i my self like anoothr better so i am a bit of a hypocrite. however in this book JMR describes to us a world that few realize was there. through margret we se the life of a poor free born girl in the 1400s who lives a bit more than an average life. we see the inquisition the plauge the horrible surrondings. it was a wonderful book and i thouroughly enjoyed it.
5,One of my favorites!,"I discovered this book by accident, actually reading its sequel first. Now both books have become a cherished part of my library. There's something so warm and human about Margaret, and the way she radiates life and light -- it's no wonder the very ghosts want to be near her. Grumpy Brother Gregory is equally endearing for the journey he makes from Margaret's skeptic to her paramour. Riley does a good job of portraying someone who believes Margaret, but can't bring himself to admit it, even in the privacy of his own mind. Every character in this book is so wonderfully crafted and believable, and the period so realistically evoked -- the whole 14th century just comes alive in these pages. What a great read."
5,Pure artistry,"Although I was never the biggest Mitropanos fan, I have to admit that beyond it's lead-off single (""Roza"", which was immense), the lyrics, musicianship and vocal delivery make this an essential album to own, for fans of Greek music, and for world music fans in general.Mitropanos had the good sense to work with Thanos Mikroutsikos, as his compositions are absolute poetry, as stated before by the previous reviewer. This material is at least on par with anything Dimitris recorded during his Marios Tokas days. ""Louna Park"" and ""Patision Ke Paramithiou Gonia"" are other standouts, but this is a concept album from Greece that even nearly 10 years later, still hits as hard as it did when it was first released.Highly recommended."
5,incredible book,"This book is wonderful. Rather than just make a blanket statement that a baby needs love, this book backs up all its statements with thorough, and yet easy to understand, research. It taught me a lot about the advantages to breastfeeding, and showed why responding to a baby's cries makes him happier, and will not spoil him. I have used her advice with my son, and he has turned out to be an extremely happy baby who is not clingy at all. His independence, happiness, and connection to me has really made me glad I read this book. I highly reccomend it."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I read an interview with the author in Mothering Magazine that I really enjoyed and decided to look for the book. I was especially hoping for some more information about starting solid foods and using formula until 18 months in children weaned before then that the author spoke about in the interview. However, I found this book to be more of an academic explanation of attachment parenting. It actually seemed more geared towards medical professionals (ironic considering the title, I know) than parents. Well written and from the attachment parenting perspective I sought--just a bit too hefty for me."
1,Inexcusable mistakes,"Having taught groups of homeschoolers from all the Wilson Primers for the last two years, I have to report that these texts are full of egregious mistakes in both the student workbooks and even in the teacher editions. It must be frustrating for homeschooling parents, who may not be familiar with the language. In addition to the numerous errors, the books are 90% vocabulary-oriented with little attention to grammar and readings. This text is one of the reasons I resigned my position."
2,Corporate greed!,Save your money; download the Torrent for free! We steal music because we're tired of being nailed by the music industry - this release is a prime example.
3,Korn & DJ Michael Watts Don't Go Together.,"This Album Is Very Weird To Me. The First Disc To Me Really Sucked. I Think It Was Stupid For Korn To Even Produce This. Like I Said Before Korn & DJ Michael Watts Don't Do Good Togather. Or Korn & Dem Franchise Boy's For That Matter. Now The Second Disc I Loved It. I Loved All The Live Proformances & The AOL Sessions Really Rocked. It Is A Great Addition To You'r Korn Collection. As Far AS The DVD It Rocked As Well. The Only Stupid Thing About It I Thought Was That They Censored It, When The Album You Bought Is Parental Advisory Already. Also The Coming Undone Wit' It Video Was Stupid I Thought. Over All I'd Say It's Worth Getting. I Mean If You Have All Of Korn's CD's Already Like I Do, You'r Collection Won't Be Complete Without It.Rock On!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BJ"
2,The decline continues,And now i say goodbye to one of my favorite bands. What was once fresh and unique has turned into filtered garbage with co-writers. The only thing worse than the SYOTOS cd itself is this rehashed garbage that cries $$... And just on time for the holidays!!! so so so sad. Now they started writing the next cd with the same co-writers.. Goodbye Korn....
1,A disgrace!!,"Instead of 1 star, i would rather spit on you for even of making a screwed and chopped album..This is a disgrace to all DJ Screw, Swisha House, etc fans... These washed-out, wanna-be, 40 yr old, FOOLS should just stick to their teenie-boppin fan base and stay AWAY from the whole ""screwed and chopped"" genre!!But.. on the other hand.. if you want to waste your hard earned money on this nonsense then go right ahead..KORN.. nobody wants to hear your stupid songs screwed and chopped...S.U.C.4.Life B*tch*s"
2,Meh.,"Ordered 4 pack, installed two. 1 broke within 10 minutes, the other left chunks of itself all over the place, but is holding steady. I'll use up the other two, but won't buy again."
5,Great little product!,Great! Small enough to fit almost anywhere and they make a nice amount of bubbles for their size. Recommend it!
3,air stones,"Not bad for one inch air stones, makes a lot of bobbles just what a fish needsAir Stone 4"""
3,Eduard,"Well I bought the pack, it came fast and it works.The only thing I don't like about it is that it makes really big bubbles, I ordered these expecting to have small sized ones which works better for the fish, I got disappointed from that fact but overall if you don't care about the size of the bubbles it would work okay."
5,Works as advertisedl,"Unlike the other reviewer, my product arrived in great condition and worked completely as expected. I'd order this again. Bubble bubble bubble :)"
2,Easily broken,"I picked up a pack of these to replace my Aerogarden stones. 2 of the 4 broke before I even got them in their tubing - and I was very gentle. The port that sits in the stone just snaps out, and you are left with a worthless airstone. Better off running out and getting them right at the store, or finding another brand."
5,Now these actually phizzy bubble,We have a big dragon in the tank and his bubble stone needs to be replaced when it stops phizzy bubbling. These work great.
3,spaghetti james bond,"I bought this after buying an almost unplayable VHS of ""The Cobra' under the title 'Cobra Connection'.Peter Martell (Pietro Martellanza) plays the violent, sexist anti-hero, supposedly a disaffected former US agent, with good support from veteran Dana Andrews and an under-used Anita Ekberg.The wise-cracking dialogue often falls flat and the plot doesn't always make sense (at least one scene has definitely been cut) but the film is visually strong, the action taking place supposedly in Istanbul and Beirut. 'Ringo the Lone Rider' is a standard Leone-type spaghetti western, no better and no worse than a hundred others."
3,Two hot tub scenes for the price of one!,"Tom Whelan's screenplays may lack the sophistication of his books, The Dakapa Handbook and The Basilicata Manifesto, but there is still something special about them. His irrevent humor and over-the-top style is present throughout both films. And My African Unlce was even a selection of the Wildwood Film Festival."
4,Metal royalty...,"In spite of his penchant for composite words in the titles of his solo albums,Jorn Lande's new opus will convert legions of new fans.Backed by a very tight band,he manages to deliver prime time grandiose rock'n'roll,payng tribute in the proces to the likes of Whitesnake and Black Sabbath,evident in the heavy grinding of the title track.All the songs are very strong and inspired,proving Lande's capabilities as a songwriter and his taste for melody.A rare album indeed."
5,The Best Singer on the Planet!!!,"this guy could sing the ingrediants on the back of a betty crocker cake mix box...doesn't matter..serious Mojo here!he can sing any style and sings with huge power, finesse and soul. check out Ark's ""burn the sun"" for the best of Jorn. Fansof early Coverdale & Dio will be blown away....yes friendsthis is a case of student out does the teacher."
3,"?'s, Poses Some, Answers Some.","The writing is engaging. The author explores the evidence and the various views of Attila over the centuries. The first chapters gave the reader the background setting of this turbulent period. I found chapters 13-21 to be the most crucial. The authors speculations on why Attila spared Italy from more devestation was good food for thought. This book should inspire the reader to do more research on the subject. But, the index is rather brief and the absense of maps was sorely missed. The problem may be that there simply are not enough original sources? When more archaeological artefacts come to light I look forward to this book being revised."
1,Disappointing,"This book never really gets to describing who Attila was.I am not a student of Attila, but have read some about the Roman Empire.The book does a half-hearted job of setting the context for the times Attila lived. It talks about some of the leaders of the eastern and western Roman empire as well as the leaders of some of the tribes in Europe threatening the western Roman empire. The book also gives very minimal information about who the Huns were and even less on what made them different at the time. The book eventually gets to several engagements between Attila and his rivals for power, but again, no depth.The book winds up with a short discussion about the mythology that has grown up around Attila.Basically, I came away knowing very little more than when I started and with no clue why Attila is important in history.I do not recommend this book."
5,Poster,I got this for my Dad after he saw it in a local grille/bar and loved it! It came in a tube and was perfect... no damage at all! He was so excited! Thank you much!! :)
5,This I a great book - read it,"I found this in my local library and loved it. Now I'm trying to get a copy and I hope this works. I you find nature/biology at all interesting, this is the book for you. If Durrell wasn't my favorite author anyways this would make him my favorite for sure."
1,f,On 2 occasions I ordered this product and both times I was shipped the plastic jewel cases and no cd media disks. I ultimately bought the same item at Radio Shack for the same price and no hassle.
2,Bosch 8-piece Drill Bit Set,"I would have given this bit set a higher rating, if one of the small bits hadn't broken off the first time I used it. There is no way to replace it with a new bit."
5,A creative marriage of art and philosophy.,"This movie is a gem. Almost flawless, you can feel that every detail has been tended to. From a great arm's length (the universe), it asks what we're meant to be doing on this ball that goes round and round. The cinematography constantly surprises, like stills in a photgraphic exhibit, and the score compliments beautifully. In the end, LePage concludes, all we have is art and poetry and love; these transcend the things that threaten to make us crazy."
2,"Disappointing, unfortunately","I have been a proud devotee of Lepage's stage work for years, all the way back to OTA. His recent DAMNATION OF FAUST at the Metropolitan Opera was an astounding marriage of music and technology.But film just isnt Robert's best metier.MOON is slow, even plodding, to the point when you want to just scream at the main character, ""Look, just get a life, okay?"" It's visually flat, which amazed me, considering how Lepage works the physical limits of the theatre.And then there's that ending. Sorry, it felt forced and sloppy, as though Lepage had written himself into a serious corner and couldnt figure out how to get out of it. The result is a true what-the-hell? scene that seems only vaguely connected to anything even remotely part of the film's thematic worldview.I dont know that I would say to avoid it. But it's really for Lepage fans, and even then, the most forgiving of them."
5,perfect book for any person,I REALLY LOVED MANDIE AND THE CHARLESTON PHANTOM.IT IS REALLY COOL.HONESLY THE ONLY BOOKS WORTH READING ARE THE MANDIE ONE'S. AS SOON AS I READ THE MANDIE BOOKS I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER. LOIS KEEP IT UP DONT STOP WRITING YOUR BOOKS ARE SUPER!!!
4,One of the best trance cd's out there!,This CD is great for those who love trance or just want a CD to dance to at partys. The music is bleded together in a continuous stream of trance and dance. I love to listen to this CD while driving and when I have partys. The reason this CD didn't recieve 5 stars is because it is one big track which means you can't skip from one song to another.
5,Outstanding Album,"Even if you're a casual fan of Manfred Mann's Earth Band, you owe it to yourself to own the album. If you think they were a good rock and roll band, this will confirm they were a great rock and roll band. Just outstanding."
4,cute book,My 2 year old daughter loves bears and really likes this book. The illustrations are cute and colorful. The book teaches about the 4 seasons.
4,Great for back or side sleepers!,"I've owned two of these pillows. Although the first one got flatter before as many years as it said it should last for me, they've been the best pillows I've had. I have problems with my neck, head, etc. with normal pillows. They are just too high. My old Simmon's Beautyrest pillow is being used by a family member, and two other family members also have this kind of pillow! They are apparently fine for side sleepers as well! I would definitely recommend them for people who have trouble with other types of pillows!"
5,Fun French for Little Ones,"I bought this book to help my one year old become familiar with French, and add to the French she hears from me. I am not a native French speaker, and was not familiar with many childrens songs. This book has great illustrations for the child plus small illustrations to help the parent with the hand movements that accompany the songs. My daughter imitates some of the movements (after only a couple weeks) and shows great interest in the songs/book. An added plus: the music is well done, as opposed to the cloying and poorly played kids music widely available."
5,Kiss the Blues Goodbye with this book!,"Julie Beard's Kiss of the Blue Dragon is the perfect example of a kick-butt heroine with a softer side. Ms. Beard has penned an excellent story with clever narrative and sassy, sparkling dialogue. Angel Baker has a past that makes her oh, so human and explains why she's a Certified Retribution Specialist. Marco is perfect, a man who's not threatened by a real woman. I hope there will be more Angel Baker books from Julie Beard!"
5,Great Passover desserts good yearround.,"I use this book year round because the desserts are so wonderful. The book ""builds"" on several key cakes that can be adapted to many different great desserts. The Hazelnut ganache cake is so good that I make it Thanksgiving, Hannukah and birthdays, as I do with the cheesecake recipe and several others. People come to my seder for the desserts. Lots of praise is good for the cook."
5,Learning to Weave-Deborah Chandler,Book was very informative - good information whether you are a beginner or more advanced weaver. Will definitely be a good reference book for my weaving library.
4,Learning to Weave- an enjoyable instruction book,"I purchased Learning to Weave to help me set up and use my grandmother's old table top loom. While this book deals with more complicated set ups, it still explains the basics. I hope to someday get one of the more complicated looms so this book will be a good reference guide. The one reason it didn't get 5 stars from me is it does tend to get wordy when giving instructions.The explanations given with each step are fine but when one is reading while doing it would be much easier if a step-action instruction were given instead of long paragraphs of prose.Another help would be more diagrams.But for its small faults, this is one of the better books on beginning to weave that I've seen."
3,Not intended for small looms,"I have a small table-top loom. This book is written for large, floor looms. The first third of the book is about setting up such a loom (setting up warp threads, etc), and many of the patterns involve treadles."
4,"Learning to Weave, Revised Edition","I really enjoyed this book. It has a lot of good information for everyone. It wasn't written for the complete beginner though. Even with that said, I think, if you're interested in getting started and learning the language etc., this is a very good book to start with."
5,Clear Instructions,Just the right amount of photographs and all of the information is clear and step-by-step. Love the book.
5,If you can only have one book.....,"Make it this one. I am an ""ok"" weaver and I refer to this book over and over again. For me, everything a new weaver needs to know is in here and you can find it easily which makes this a real must have for anyone wanting to learn how to weave or if you are thinking you might want to learn how, please start with this book."
1,Nancy Fisher is definitely not Robin Cook!,"It was hard to believe that Ms. Fisher was really attempting to pull this story off as believable. The beginning of the book was slow, and the pace did not improve much. Dr. Slater was particularly annoying as the ""mad scientist"" character. Occasionally the characters were confusing, and the story line zig zagged around too much. The reader is unsure if the main character's former alcoholism is the important feature for awhile, or if he/she should focus on the criminal ongoings of the hospital. Normally, this kind of bi-theme works, but Ms. Fisher played it badly, and neither event would sell any tickets. I think I will stick with Robin Cook from now on."
1,Highly disappointing....,"A more accurate title should be, ""A Witch's Book of Opinions"". Answers are either to vague or are from the author's perspective only. This book is definately not worth the cover price. I don't care who wrote a commentary on the back of the book!""What's your Wicca IQ?"" is better priced, much more informative and adds a touch of humor."
1,Oh the horror,"This is one of the only books that I will tell people never to buy as it is a pure waste of money. Witchcraft (or Wicca for that matter) is not black and white. There is a whole spectrum of color involved. I have to agree with a previous poster who said that this should have been called The Witch's Book of Opinions. And not very good ones at that. There is no one right or wrong way of doing things in Witchcraft. And to totally dismiss one of the key figures in modern Witchcraft and call all of his work trash is ignorant, disrespectful and childish. They obviously do not realize that Crowley and Gardner were major influences on each others works. If you dismiss Crowley's teachings then you must also dismiss many of Gardner's."
4,Good Book,"I felt that this book was a GOOD book. However, I had already read a LOT of other books, too. Read this one with an open mind, just like all the other books you read. And remember that there are always other answers to the questions THEY answered.I've really enjoyed every book that Eileen Holland has written so far and this one was no different....."
4,Kinuko y craft: The Wish Is For More,"Purchased from Amazon: The Kinuko Craft illustrations hold some of the most magickal concepts and style--like a tapestry in a dream, while the little bits of information about the artist render her nearly as fascinating as her work. Many of the selections are from book jacket covers of the author Patricia McKillip. The book itself is large so that the prints are satisfying as to discernible details, so lovely. I only wish the book had been a bit longer, a thicker version would have made this book perfect."
3,Not for new bellydancers,"I personally own the 4 disk set with ""Into to belly dance, the warrior Goddess, dancing with veils, and finger symbols"". This DVD is good, but not the best of the 4. This one can be a little complicated for new dancers. I suggest the ""Intro to Belly dance workout"" (its a yellow cased DVD) for more of a workout and it is much easier and explained more clearly. The ""Intro to Belly Dance Workout"" is also really easy to keep up with and slow paced so it is easy to keep up with! If you are not experienced at all, Id go with the yellow cased ""Intro to Belly Dance Workout"", and later move onto this one. Honestly, out of the 4 DVD's I own, I really don't ever use this one and I am experienced... This DVD is just kind of boring to me. Just not into ""The Warrior Goddess"". Go with the intro! I gave 3 stars because I love Dolphina!"
1,Just Ridiculous,"This is a complete joke, and you can't even call it a workout. I agree that she doesn't really explain the moves well, so you're always scrambling to figure out what's going on. For me, the really bad part is that it's not a workout at all. There's nothing the least bit physically challenging about it. I didn't breathe hard, I didn't sweat, I didn't feel sore or challenged. Even the most basic of yoga workouts makes you feel like you're working, but not this waste of time. I think I might burn more calories laying in bed reading a heavy book."
1,hilarious dialogue,"The things she says, made me out and out laugh while trying to pay attention to what she was doing, the dialogue is just that bad. ""Pretend you have a precious ruby and you don't want to share it, you want to hide it from the world, now you've discovered it's flawed, so pop it out, now you realize it's not flawed so bring it back"" Really?! Besides the dialogue, I felt the workout was overall ineffective, and she's hard to follow, I felt like it was a nice little stretch which was nice, but still needed to get a jog in to get my heart rate up."
4,Nice item,This is definitely a good item my corals all seem to open wider and my shrimp molt in a healthy manner.
4,"Good for Game Cube games, too!","Since I replaced all of my DVD cases with slim jewel cases made by Memorex, I wanted to do the same thing with my Game Cube games. Luckily, I found these and they do the job. What more can I say about a jewel case after all? However, I want to point out that they can be subject to cracking. I consider this to be a tradeoff (space-saver vs. durability) that I can live with."
3,It's OK!,"It moves very slowly with detailed description and the reader has to be patient! Skylark was OK, but not among my favorite books."
5,Excellent for making fork sculptures,"These pliable, but strong forks are excellent for art projects. I purchased these forks for my children who wanted to bend forks to make small sculptures. These turned out to work out very well for that. The metal is strong and can be bent again and again. I highly recommend them for this purpose. They are probably good for eating too, but we didn't try that."
4,Independent country is alive and well in Texas,"This is the kind of under-the-radar country album that renews one's faith in the indie scene in general, and Texas in particular. Old-time Austin locals with a strong set of honkytonk-tinged originals, and guitarist Redd Volkaert in among all the good-natured pickers who give this disc its loose, limber sound. The first couple of Texas shufflin' songs have a vigorous originality, then Tomblin takes a socially-conscious, folkie turn on ""Illegal Man,"" about a fella who gets gets a taste of what the life of an undocumented worker is like (though the songs doesn't quite explain how he arrived there... ) Then the rest of the album starts to drift a bit, with strongest songs at the start; still, the Tomblin crew sounds pretty solid, and this disc is certainly worth checking out."
2,Too many problems,After 2 years of use my initial impression that this is a lousy printer were right. Now the ADF chews up the paper every time instead of just some time. The scanner software has never worked despite numerous contacts with Brother and the third-party vendor (Scan Soft now Nuance). The shipped drivers never worked on my XP machines. I have had to download the current versions from Brother every time.
1,My software wouldn't install either,"Software crashed my computer whenever I tried to install. I saw another review complaining of the same. Updated everything on my Windows XP Pro computer--bios, windows updates, and shut down all anti-virus software. Still it crashed with the blue screen first.I called Brother tech support. When I finally go through they were no help and basically said nothing could be done. I asked them for an e-mail stating such so I could take to the store to get a refund but they refused. I got so mad I swore at the man.Okay, I shouldn't have lost my temper. But you've been there, right? I wasted hours on this. I would not buy if I were you. This is about useless without the software."
2,not really a bargain,"Because this is a laser printer, the scanner is only B&W and produces very poor images. The toner cartridge is hard to replace, and the process of replacing it exposes the (expensive) photoelectric drum and the drum is easily damaged. The printer and fax features work well; however, I would not recommend this item."
2,Used Brother mfc7420,"My husband received this from a friend who no longer used it. It did great for a few months for B&W copies, but suddenly started jamming. Sometimes it will work okay if you adjust the paper in the tray after each copy, but sometimes jams on the first go despite prepping the paper in the tray. The paper is not usable as anything but scratch paper after that so it will have to go. I am using up every last bit of toner first by covering up the laser light holes (whatever they're called). I did go on to the Brother's web site and did a bunch of cleaning that they recommended which had no effect on the jams. This seems to be a common complaint on this model recently."
4,It has been a gem!,I bought my MFC-7420 at a store closing for a sale price four years ago. I've had no problems with it. I never use the fax because I have no need. I recommend it.
5,"Works great,good price",Brother quality and ease of use.Only slight downside: does not remember date and time when turned off.Remote setup is quick when you need to input date and time.
4,very good value and reliable performance,"I replaced an HPG80 and Canon 4150 with this Brother unit. I am happy that I made the change. I wanted to get away from ink cartridges and use toner so I dont always have to have cartriges on hand, which end up costing much more than toner. It also prints faster and more reliably. The Canon product was horrible and I would not recommend it to my worst enemy. The Brother unit is a solid performer, integrates well with a separate telephone answering machine (which the Canon could NOT). The machine is relatively quiet and functions well as a printer, copier and fax. The scanner resolution is not great, but certainly adequate. The price is right and worth the money!"
1,Don't Buy From Brother! Customer Service is Terrible,"I was very happy with this printer for the first 3 and a half months. The print quality was good. Then the toner cartidge said it was out so I replaced it. After that all of the copies were faded and washed out. Originally Brother's customer service said they would send a new printer. Then they called back the next day and said I had to replace the drum first even though it should get 12,000 copies, they said the warranty for that was expired. They said they would give me a discount based on the pages I had printed. Since I had printed less than 20% I expected 80% but they only offered 50% expecting me to shell out $80 more on their defective printer. I am losing business because of this.Word of advice, buy HP. I never had a problem with my HP. My Brother sucks and so does the customer service."
5,"Excellent printer, Linux support","Very happy with this mfc. Does everything advertised and was easy to set up. We use linux, windows, and mac in the house and all were set up and printing quickly to this unit.Pros:++ Brother supplies linux print and scanner drivers - work perfectly+ scan/fax/copy from document feeder or flatbed+ fax works with my vonage service (used hints from vonage faq)+ apple mac drivers work great+ using linux print/scan server we print/scan from all clients in household on networkCons:- envelopes must be fed one-at-a-time- power gobbler when it starts up like most if not all laser printers"
4,"great , could be better","the machine works great...sends/receives faxes easliy...great copier...only thing is miss is a color option. Would be great if they could incorporate a color cartridge into this. The amchine works super, otherwise."
5,Vista operating office multi-function laser,"Purchased this unit with recent update to Vista with our office management system. While our transition to Vista has not been without issue the Brothers MFC-7420 has performed flawlessly. Plugged in 110V and USB, loaded the Vista software driver and it has been fully functional since."
5,I'll continue to stick with Brother Multi-Function Centers,"This is my second Brother all-in-one and it's meeting all of my expectations. These machines are dependable workhorses! They're perfect for small businesses as well as for personal use. The print is always crisp and clear and the flatbed copier makes copying pages from books a snap. My first Brother Multi-Function Center took a beating from heavy work demand and still lasted for over 5 years. This model is not as bulky and takes up less room on my desk. Easier to use, too. I'm very pleased with this purchase, which met my modest price point. I can only imagine how much better the newer model performs."
5,Great little work horse,"I purchased this MFC a few years back and initially used it only sparingly to print a few documents and maybe receive the odd fax or two. Today, I decided to digitize into PDF format a 100 page paper document that had been sitting on my shelf for some time. The Control Center software that I updated from the web for Windows Vista was only able to scan single sided documents, which was frustrating because most documents are double sided. A quick web search led to the solution: the Scansoft PaperPort software that comes with the Brother MFC 7420 does the trick. After spending some time learning how to use the software and experimenting with the settings, I have the output that I want. Now I can toss away the paper document and keep the PDF file for my records!"
4,As Advertised...,"This performs as advertised. Crisp, clear prints and copies. Fax works beautifully. I have no complaints whatsoever. While large, it is still alot smaller than some of the behemoths I've looked at. I am very pleased with the purchase."
4,A great book,"Even thought I am 12, I read business books. My dad brought back ""Satisfaction"" to read and, of course, I took it and wanted to read it! You might think that it's wierd for a kid to learn about business but it's very interesting concept.The book talks about customer satisfaction and how it's important for a business to have its customers satisfied. J.D. power shows specific examples of happy customers and unhappy customers. Some of them are actually funny to read. It's very interesting. The author shows us how to get customer satisfaction in a company and how to avoid it. I've learned how customer satisfaction is the key to make a business work.It's a very interesting book and I recommend it."
5,Save Money on Textbooks,"My daughter lost three of her high school textbooks, and it was going to cost me an arm and a leg to replace them. I bought used books on Amazon and saved a ton! I was thrilled that I found out about this option."
2,grandchildren like this game,"This game is great for the kids. I bought it for myself, not enough going on for adults."
5,Sunshine,"This book was the bomb! It kept me up at night because I didn't want to put it down. As I was driving down the street I would read it at every red light. It will made you THINK you want to change your day time profession. HaHa After reading this, you MUST read part2...... GOING BROKEGOING BROKE explained why I wanted to keep my day job..... SMILING"
4,A good Read!!,"I actually enjoyed reading this book, it was easy to get into and flowed together really well. Great job Trista!"
4,GOOD!,"THIS BOOK WAS GOOD. I DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT THAT SHE HAD TO BE A HO TO GET MONEY, BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. I LIKE THE FACT THAT HAD FINALLY FOUND LOVE WITH TREMEL. I LOVE TRISTA RUSSELL BOOKS SO I'LL CONTINUE TO READ THEM. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL. GOOD JOB!"
4,good,I enjoyed it. Especially when everything caught up to her. I haven't read this book in years so I forgot most of it but i do remember enough .
5,Wonderful Work,Excellent book!! The title does not give the book justice. I was not expecting a page turner from the title. Wonderful story line...FULL OF DRAMA...from page one to the end! Had to read ahead...just so I could find out what was going to happen in advance. Can't wait until the next book!UnTchablGAALG.A.A.L. Book Club
5,You're Gonna Love it!,Going Broke is a great book and really hard to put down. Trista Russell is a very talented author who really knows how to bring the drama in every chapter! You are gonna Love Going Broke!
1,Wrong conclusions.,"How can you trust them to get the events surrounding the fall of Jerusalem right when they can't get early Christianity right? They pitted Paul and James against each other as rivals of two different streams of Christianity. They said point blank that the prophecy of Jesus concerning the end of the world did not come to pass and the Biblical authors (specifically Luke) had to go back and re-write their gospels to compensate for the failed prophecy. There were some other really bad things too, but I highlighted some of the worst. It has a completely naturalistic and liberal perspective on religion and I would say they had a clear agenda to cast doubt on the Christian faith. They also portrayed Josephus as a trader who couldn't be trusted and casted doubt that he faithfully reported the truth in some areas. That may be true but how can I trust them? Their credibility is shot."
1,Picture quality might look better after a poke to the eyes,"Brought to you by the same people who gave us Grindhouse Experience volume 1 & 2, The Martial Arts Essentials features great kung fu titles but the DVD transfers are among the worst you have ever seen. SLP mode VHS with picture rolls and shaky picture. Such a shame..."
4,Easy to put together. Good value.,"I bought two bikes from Amazon, and this one was WAY better than the other. It was easy to put together and the shifting worked well without having to adjust anything. It is very heavy-duty and I think my son will get several years of use out of it. The only thing I would suggest is to get a deraileur protector. That is a ""V"" shaped piece of metal that goes over the deraileur and protects it when your kids drops his bike (which my kid does a lot). If you don't know much about bikes, have your local shop put it together for you. They will probably only charge $25-$30 and will adjust the brakes properly as well as the gears if necessary."
1,Inventory problems,"I had a similar problem like one of the other reviews about bike sizing. I ordered this bike for Christmas and when it showed up it didn't match the picture or model number on the webpage and it was actually a boy's bike. Needless to say I sent it back and requested they send me the bike that matches the photo and model number. The second bike arrived and it was the very same bike I had just shipped back. I spoke with a very helpful person at Amazon, Jared V., and he looked into the matter and it turns out there is a discrepancy with the warehouse. So rather than try for a 3rd time, I selected a different model which should be arriving today. Amazon was helpful with the whole process and even upgraded my shipping for free. I'd recommend choosing a different bike so you don't have to go through the trouble of receiving something other than what you ordered."
3,Not for Big People,Do not buy this bike if you are a bigger adult. I made that mistake. I did not happen to notice that it has 24 inch wheels. I would recommend that you be a shorter or young adult if you are considering buying this bike. The bike is of great quality though. I went and purchased the 26 inch version after I returned the 24 inch and I could not be happier with it. Looks and rides smooth. The only reason for the 3 stars and not 5 was the sizing issue.
1,Wrong Size Bike recieved twice,"We ordered the 24 inch bike for our son and recieved the 26 inch version, twice. Customer service was helpful but we had to return the bike twice and finally recieved a refund."
3,Good Starter Book...,"Ralph Wilson could be fairly called an ""international treasure"". His web site and writings have guided many internet marketers to success and prosperity. He is widely consider to be one of the true ""good guys"" on the net. He has earned that respect.This book, however, is best called a ""newbie"" book. Good basic information, but not something that is going to excite or benefit the person who is already beyond the basics.If, however, you are just starting to dip your toes into the wild ride called ""internet marketing"", then this book will get you off to a good start."
2,OK but not great,"The book does a good intro on the topic. But as the other reviewer says, it's short on delivery and action plan. To me, this book would be good for someone who does not have much experience with the Web. If you know what ROI and CPM mean, then skip this book and pick up one that has more techniques in it."
5,An Excellent Book,"Dr. Wilson is one of the few Internet marketing experts whom I trust implicitly. Why? Everything he advocates in his book you can see in action on his web sites and in his ezines. He lives up to the saying, ""Practice what you preach."" (He happens to be an ordained minister too). Plus, he does it all with integrity. His reviews are thorough, well-written, and objective--just like this book. Ask any successful Internet marketer for their ""short-list"" of most-respected experts and Ralph Wilson's name will appear on that list. I did not find his book to be ""just for beginners."" It is a comprehensive approach to Internet marketing so it necessarily includes elements about which experienced marketers are already familiar. I see that as a strength, not a limitation of this text."
4,A must for e-marketers.,"There are many reasons to buy Wilson's book online!- If you or your friends have a business then I bet you're either looking for your Web site or you have got it. Well look no more... Wilson shows you how to identify e-business opportunities, build your Internet brand, and define your e-business niche.- Wilson's book is here with hands-on exercises to enhance your Web experience! What you can do with it is unbelievable!- It's also a great chance to make some extra money with his chapter on ""Writing Your Internet MarketingPlan""!- I currently hold the copy of that Wilson's book and I think this might be an opportunity for you and your site to make money from a truly marketing approach.- I strongly recommend that you take a look at Wilson's book and start converting your directed traffic to revenue.- Last but not least, try the Amazon buy experience!"
2,O.K.,"In general, this book is rudimentary. I acquired most of the information from my Internet-based experience in a non-marketing role. It might be nice and well for people new to eBusiness, but for veterans it holds mostly ""well, duh"" information.For anyone that wants some real insight without the clutter of basic Internet marketing mechanics, check out the book MindControlMarketing.com by Mark Joyner."

2,Not Hikari Bulb- Lasted 3 Weeks,The bulb is not Hikari as advertised. I made sure not to touch the glass with my fingers. Bulb lasted 3 weeks. Waiting for replacement.
2,Not as expected,"I bought this halogen bulb after reading others reviews. The item arrived in good packing and in time. I was quite happy to receive it. I immediately put it. When I switched it on, it seemed like a dim night bulb. I thought may be it will brighten up in a while. Although in my mind the other thought coming was that it is a halogen bulb of 100W, and it should be bright enough as 100W from the moment it is turned on. Anyway, to my disappointment the bulb is still the same, gives quite dim light. If I have to compare it, I will have to compare it with probably a 14W or lesser bulb. The only little good part is that it works. So, I am not in dark. I will not at all recommend this to anyone."
3,"Nice Hat, Sloppy Finish","This hat was authentic pith. However, the finish was markedly poor. By that I mean the air holes did not line properly and were askew. It had a dent on the crown that was quite noticeable. They skimped on the amount of cloth used in the lining whereby large areas of pith were not covered. Not a bad product for the money. However, quality control needs to be implemented in this made in Vietnam product."
3,More from Hector & Virgil,"As a sequel to the first book, The Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast, the Pillow Book provides more stories from our beloved brothers Hector & Virgil. One of the lines from the novel sums up my love & appreciation for the writing: ""..They wanted to create a place where people who are oppressed by the notion that there are too many books and too little time to read them might carve out a retreat;where gentle souls who carry the burden of knowing that the world is too much with them can set aside a week or ten days to whittle down their list of 'books to which I must one day get around'""-As a lover of books, this idea sounds like the perfect escapism. That is what Bill Richardson accomplishes in his writing-escapism with the various characters we meet at the Bachelor Brothers Bed & Breakfast, and another peek into the family unit of Hector & Virgil. The book is speckaled with funny little anecdotes throughout. While not quite as good as the first novel, it's still a charmer."
3,A bit of a dissappointment,"After loving the first book, I was hoping for more of the same. But it is hard to live up to superlative. So, this still very good book seemed a bit of a let down - nothing greatly original or better than the first. I didn't much care for all the solomon solomon jokes. Still, it was a delightful read, and made this BBBB fan happy nonetheless. I hope there is more !"
2,A Bit of a Hodgepodge,"You couldn't say this book had much of a plot. It's more like a collection of anecdotes. Some were entertaining, some not. I liked the letters from former guests at the B&B.; I didn't care much for the sex or the occasional slapstick. I haven't read the first book in the series, so I can't compare. For the owners of a business, the two brothers didn't seem to do much work.I have stayed at only one B&B;, and my husband and I were the only guests at the time. It was a lovely place. The owner sat down and ate breakfast with us and told us about many of the interesting guests she and her husband had housed. They didn't seem to have much life outside the business, which seemed understandable. The bachelor brothers seemed to have too much life outside the B&B;."
3,okay,"I received these earrings quickly and well packaged. However pretty they are, they are much smaller than I anticipated. I guess that's my fault for not looking at the sizing. Not sure if I'll keep as they aren't very big, and I don't like huge earrings. They kind of disappear in my hair."
3,one word CHEEP,The earrings are really ok but i had to squeeze most of the jump rings on them because they would come apart. They look great online--but don't be fooled by twinkling and turning!
4,Earrings,Bought this earrings for my Grandson's wife this Christmas and they looked very nice on her. The color went well with what she was wearing.
3,uncertain value,"Well, half of it is boast and brag, accusations and self-defense. When successfully ignoring that one may learn something :) ... I strongly recommend to read Admiral Sandy Woodward's 'One-hundered Days - The Memories of the Falkland Battlegroup Commander' - best before reading this book because the sea-action preceeded the land-action and the abilities of the ships defined possible and impossible approaches."
2,Not very durable and not the best quality,"The cardboard that it is made out of is not as thick as I thought it would be and the day I received it the spin cover (a thin piece of cardboard covered in fabric) of the box holder came off. I was able to glue the spin cover back on, but that should not happen. The binder works for the purpose it was designed, the quailty could be better in materials. I suppose you get what you pay for."
4,Review of Mahfouz' 'Thebes at War',"This was a step-down from 'Rhadopis,' but, like the first translation in the series ('Khufu's Wisdom'), still a fair translation. Luckily, the thematic presence of this book is enough to distract the reader from the so-so rhetorical style. Mahfouz is working harder than every to use ancient Egypt as a center of political allegory. This work is very much a commentary on Mahfouz' Egypt. It was also interesting to see Mahfouz (or perhaps the translator) have the fallen dynasty describe themselves as 'slaves,' and paint this reprisal as an uprising for freedom. The parallels there will the Biblical account of the Hebrews are incredibly interesting."
3,"beautiful, but not so practical","this is my second svan chair, i now have one highchair and one youth chair. i think they are beautiful, that's why i'm sucked into buying them, but the screws often come a little loose so the chair gets a little wobbly and we always have to re-tighten. they also made the model a bit larger, which i really don't like because it's one of the reasons i was originally attracted to this chair, most other highchairs are huge and take up so much space. their new cherry colour is also not cherry at all - it used to be, but currently it's quite close to natural which was a bit disappointing. i actually prefer this chair as a youth chair (rather than an infant chair) because the baby part is a bit hard to get babies in and out of and it doesn't tilt back like a lot of the plastic ones do but as a youth chair, my 2 year old can climb in and out herself and sit and eat comfortably."
4,Very Best Canned Heat Album Ever,"Great Album for Canned Heat affectionados. I bought it because it had ""It's Allright"" on it and that tune is dammed near impossible to find. The other songs on the album are classic Heat tunes but, the LP is sorely missing ""Terraplane Blues""."
3,"Good, cheap replacement, but...","Can't beat the price, and the packaging was great and item arrived undamaged. However, after I washed the Liberty I noticed there were water droplets inside this new light I had just replaced, and none inside the old factory one on the other side, so it would appear they aren't as watertight as factory originals (The rubber seal on the light socket was intact). I don't know what the long term effects might be, since it's only been installed for a month. The droplets eventually dried up and the light still looks good and bright. We live in a dry southwest climate, don't know what would happen in a rainy area, or a salt water environment. Might be something to consider."
5,Heavenly Music,"I highly recommend these Alwyn selections..they are lyrical and calming, an oasis of peaceful melody. Highly recommended for fans of Hohvanness, Delius, or Vaughn Williams."
5,An Interesting and Entertaining Look At Theodore Roosevelt,"""Teddy Roosevelt: An American Lion"" is an interesting and entertaining look at Theodore Roosevelt. Disc One talks about Roosevelt's life from 1858 to 1901. Disc Two talks about Roosevelt's life from 1901 to 1919. ""Teddy Roosevelt:An American Lion"" talks about everything that happened in Roosevelt's life, and the most interesting parts are where you learn about Roosevelt's work in President Benjamin Harrison's cabinet and where you learn about Roosevelt's relationships with Woodrow Wilson and William Howard Taft. Former President Bill Clinton is in ""Teddy Roosevelt:An American Lion"" and discusses things that happened during Roosevelt's administration and the impact Roosevelt had on him. ""Teddy Roosevelt:An American Lion"" is an awesome DVD,and even if you're not a fan of Theodore Roosevelt, this is a must have for all TR/History buffs."
3,Overpriced,"These work well enough, but I paid $6 and found them the next day for $1.50 at the grocery store."
5,Keep clean and cute!,"Just buy them! I guarantee that you will be happy! It's been a while since we started using them. We love them! You can keep your teeth brush dry and clean, and always cute! We got blue and red!"
3,not bad,THis book is pretty straightforward and helpful for my class but we didn't get to use it that much. It is worth having.
3,"Cheap, but appears to work so far","Got this fan clutch for my sons Nissan Pathfinder (along with a bunch of other parts) a few months ago and it seems to be working like it should. I was a little sceptical when I looked at it, definitely cheap looking conpared to the factory clutch, smaller, fewer fins, etc. The studs supplied with it are too short so had to use the originals off the old clutch. Overall it saved some money and it works, will see how long it lasts."
3,Engaging study of the Wake but certainly no introduction,"The book's title is very misleading. This is by no means an INTRODUCTION to Finnegans Wake. There's about a dozen other books out there that will introduce you to that uncannily complex book. This one is more of a focused study on one aspect of Joyce and his masterpiece: feminism.Keeping that in mind, it's still a pretty good book with plenty of fresh insights and perspectives. If you haven't had any experience with reading or studying the Wake, stay away from this one, but if you're a seasoned Wakean there will be lots of new ideas in here for you. I especially enjoyed his discussion of Anna Livia as African."
5,Good case. Just use a different power supply.,"Cooler Master makes some of the best cases out there. The first thing you should know is that the case is designed perfectly in my opinion. The design is not cheap like some others that give you lacerations when installing the motherboard and other components. Smooth light-weight rolled edges all the way around, inside and outside. The paint on the case is of very good quality. You can tell that this isn't one of those cases that some kid in a back alley in a foreign country painted by hand.Ditch the included power supply! Cases that include a power supply aren't the best deals at least the power supply end of the deal. Most times the included power supplies burn out very fast as they are cheaply constructed.Choose this case. Choose a power supply and the rest of the components and this case makes an excellent home for them."
3,Love the case,Its a simple case no frills and I have had not one problem with it. Its a Cooler Master so you come to expect quality.
5,Cooler Master 330,I am very pleased the way it looks and how everthing is set up. arrived on time and have no issues so far.
2,Great Amazon Service......Poor CoolerMaster Service,"When I tested my power supply, I found it wasn't putting out the required voltages. Amazon.com was quick to replace it, but the replacement (although better) still wasn't right so I contacted CoolerMaster. They didn't even provide me with the courtesy of a response. The case is nice. Only two thumb screws even though both sides need to come off. It would have been swell if the usb ports were actually in a 3.5"" case so they could be moved."
4,A book of courage and sadnesss,"I likes this book. I read it for English. We did an essay on this novel and it mad me realize how hard it would be living with out family and being alone in the world. Carl was ddependent for his brother Harly. In a way Aunt Beryl helped Carl to be stronger, worthy and responsible."
3,A bridge to wisemans cove,"In my opinion, this book was great. It was sad, realistic, and it made you want to keep reading. I would recomend it for anyone aged 12-16.This story, in a nutshell, Follows Carl Matt, after he and his younger brother are abandoned by their older sister, who had been looking after them. The two boys move in with their abusive aunt, who lives in anouther town. When Carl arrives there, he is faced with much resentment from the towns inhabitants, but he doesn't know why. The book tells his story as he tries to find out what his grandfather did, and try to beat his genes, to try and be different from all the Matts before him"
1,I Did Not Receive This Products,"Yes, I ordered Garden Palette Flower Garden Art Poster Print by Kent Wallis, 35X27 on 24 March 2007 but I have not received it so far. How could I write my review about it? Please tell me what happened to this item or its where about as I was already charged and had paid for it.RegardsArmando Dela Cruz"
3,Poor scan quality,"The content of the book is very interesting and presented well, but the scan quality is horrendous. About half the commas look like periods, parts of several letters are missing or appear on the line below, there are typos, many l's look like capital I's, and the spacing is inconsistent. This makes the book difficult to read. I expected something better from Cambridge."
3,Liked this CD,"I have followed Billy Redfield on My Space for quite a while. I am glad to see he is stepping up his career. This CD is pretty good, I hope his career takes off now.Billy is a good guy, I hope he sells a lot of CDs."
4,Amazing story of world travel.,"I am fascinated by birds and their amazing travels. This book is a collection of beautiful photographs of the red knot and its environment. The authors give a treasure trove of information about this small shorebird and the thousands of miles they migrate every year. It is also creates a sense of environmental awareness, and how small changes in the environment can affect the lives of thousands of these creatures. A great way to learn about the intracrite relationships in nature. It will make you marvel and what these and other migratory birds are able to accomplish!"
3,"not the best of the Blue Kangaroo books, but fun","This is the fourth Blue Kangaroo book by Emma Clark, and though it features the same loveable marsupial and his willful friend Lily, it lacks the charm of the earlier three. When Lily approaches several adults and asks them to do things for her, she finds they are busy and she's forced to do things for herself. Lily is learning self-reliance, but her mischievous charm is absent. It's nice to see these characters again, but this is the least captivating outing by this pair."
4,THIS BOOK WILL LIGHT UP YOUR TASTEBUDS!!!!!,"This book has a whole lot of eating going on, little content and no morals. If you want to learn to have (oral sex) this is the book for you. The book is about Rory wanting Clara to become the first school principal and he presents her to the board which is all male and Medlarkin doesnt want a woman principal but Rory mom has a secret for him and he has no other choice but to let Clara show her skills. In the meantime, the novel gives you a few twist and turns if Clara will be successful or fail, if Illique will learn to satisfy a woman with his tonque, if his escapade with two women will be fulfilling, if Medlarkin secret will be revealed and if Rory and Clara will be married. Throughout all this, sex is better than ever for all characters involved, a good read if your interested in (wild, fulfilling, good sex)!!."
2,"""oversized"" was misleading...","Been keeping book for ball teams for 10 years. This book had very small spaces and was not very detailed. I had to create extra pages to log the info my coach wanted. Lots of games per book but I didn't like it very well at all. Not sure what was ""oversized"" about it. Did not fit our needs at all."
4,"solid product, pilot bits are all the same size","didn't realize the drill bits themselves are all the same diameter, the centering sleeve is #6 #8 #10. that said, works great to get the hole started. you'll still need to run another bit through the 1/2 or 3/4 inch start this gives you."
5,Worked great,Dont know how I ever got along without these . Make hinge installation easy. Highly recommended. Well made. Wil be handy for other drilling tasks requiring the holes to be centered for correct alignment
3,solid tools buy how you keep all three together without the case?,This is Bosch tool.Quality and solid but how you can keep all three together?when you need this bits you always search the other ones you need in your tool box for enough time to get mad..Guys just a simple very simple case can solve the big problem tough and i am willing to pay for that either.
5,COOKIES AT NANA'S HOUSE,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND I WAS VERY IMPRESED WITH THIS AUTHOR. FOR BEING A FIRST TIME AUTHOR SHE HAS WROTE A BOOK EVERY HOUSEHOLD WITH YOUNG CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE . SHE HAS HIT ON EVERY LITTLE THING A CHILD WILL DEAL WITH IN LIFE. I THINK EVERY MOTHER YOUNG OR OLD SHOULD GET THIS BOOK AND READ IT TO THEIR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY SHE HANDLED HARD KNOCKS FOR CHILDREN. MY ADVISE --- BUY THE BOOK YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.
4,Surprisingly off beat,"This children's book is relatively unusual. For a book with only 24 pages, the plot is surprisingly and delightfully complex - though not too complex for my 5-year-old niece to follow. The ending can be considered ""a surprise ending"" - I won't say more - and is sure to delight Eeyore fans. I liked the inclusion of Pooh-specific details such as a Heffalump trap and the game Poohsticks. This book is not for all children, but it may be perfect for some."
5,Got to have if you are interested in S.W. radio!!!!!!,"I have been reading this book for 10 years, & find it invaluable for any info about new & old equipment.Great info about stations & broadcasts from around the globe & program schedules.Also good info for newcomers to sw. Highly reccomend as a gift for anyone that you might want to share your hobby with."
3,Passport to World Band Radio,"I have a Grundig Sattelit 800, so I know my radio is sufficient, and this is overall a great book, but the schedule of times and frequencies can be way off at times. This really isn't their fault, as the radio stations change frequencies or even fall of the face of the earth (depending on some different countries political climates), but it was kind of a let-down to buy this book, thinking it had all the frequencies set up, almost like a TV guide if you will, and then alot of them dont really come in.If you dont have a radio at all, or are wanting to upgrade to a better model, their review of radios and antennas is *really* good.Overall it's a good book, but if you are buying it for a guide to frequencies, you'd be better off checking websites and mailing lists (IMNSHO)."
1,Worth Zero Stars,"Once again black women are on the bottom of the food chain. Perhaps you didn't know that because of the black woman some black men: can't hold jobs; be good husbands and fathers; date/marry outside the race; are criminals; etc. This woman takes pride in being an idiot. I wouldn't date a black man who took this ""book"" seriously but then again everyone seeks his/her own level."
4,a different perspective,the importance of this work is that we finally have an author who tries to connect survival skills developed during the bondage period with the current behavior tendencies. most black women are in denial and refuse to examine many of these habits and tendencies from the bondage period that have been passed on from generation to generation without question. it is a chance to examine the state of black relationships from a fresh viewpoint.
3,Find the good from amidst the bad,"As with many things, this book is a mixture of the good and the bad. Some of it is pure dreck. It certainly is presented in an oversensationalized manner. But then there are some accurate and at time hard-hitting and accurate observations and commentary on our interpersonal relationships as Black people. Find those truths that do lie within and reflect on them. Leave the rest of the nonsense surrounding them behind."
1,A BIG JOKE OF A BOOK.,I would give this negative a million stars if I could. I think this is not really a woman but a stupid man in drag. I would suggest you read Gloria Steinem's The Revolution from within. It's a smarter counter-point to this book. Don't waste your time on Ali's self-hatred and sexism.
3,What a Controversy!,"When I read Ms. Ali's book I was stunned. It made me angry, it made me nervous and darn it, it made me think. I will not say that I agreed with everything Ms. Ali said. In fact I reject two of her major points entirely but I do thing this book should be read and discussed as part of the ongoing dialouge that must take place between black men and women.Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men."
3,Use what you can and that's it.,"This book can be very controversial. I would recommend whoever reads it, whether a black man or a black woman, be very objective. Use what you can and let the hating go. Obviously Ms. Ali has some insight on the types of black woment that exists but she also seems to have a grudge against some. She's just human and it's just her opinion but you can be a wiser person regarding black women after you read it. But if you have a weak mind, you'll hate them."
1,"Sista, have you lost your mind??","To hear Sharazad Ali tell it, the black woman is a fat, funky, foul-mouthed, evil b-word who needs periodic physical abuse by black men to keep her in line. She actually advocates, in print, black men slapping black women in the mouth whenever they talk back.She also writes at great length about how black women neglect themselves and their appearance, and how much their hair and bodies stink.Does Ms. Ali really believe this nonsense, or is she just writing this garbage to sell her book?This book has got to be the most inane, irresponsible, and reprehensible piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to come across.If this is the opinion Ms. Ali really has of black women, and sadly enough, she herself is a black woman, then all I can say to Ms. Ali is, check yourself."
1,Remarkable Pablum,"When I rated this turkey one star, I was just kidding.Zip, zero, nyet stars assigned to this glossy, yet steaming, pile of manure. Revisionist History Is Us would've been a better title.This country's losing its guts."
1,UFO:THE EARLY YEARS,"I cannot recommend this 2 vhs boxed set at all,pictures quality is not clear and the worst of all is the distorted sound quality,this is evident on both tapes and not just in places.The only good thing about this set is the colorful box thats it,I have another 2 tape set from this beyond series and this to is very poor quality.I think the main problem is they have used very poor quality cassette tape to record these programs on."
3,Lacks depth,"The book starts that it is ment for experienced Java programmers who want to get up to speed quickly. However it only touches each subject so lightly that an eperienced programmer would have had enough from the API documentation and other sources.For example the chapter about autoboxing fails to mention what happens when you unbox a null object, while that would be the interesting case.I also fail to understand how an entire chapter can be devoted to the enhanced for loop. The part about generics would require more chapters, one introduction and one more advanced part. When diving into generics things get complicated, but it is not described in this book.The part about annotiation fails to mention that the @SuppressWarnings annotation is not implemented in 1.5"
3,Itrip,"This seems like a good product. I've noticed that i have to switch stations on it a lot to make the music come through clear, but that might be because of my location. It's small, portable, and plays my music in the car. Great product"
2,Buyer beware!,"The product works, however a month into use, it literally just fell apart while in use in my car. I would recommend that someone just spend ten extra dollars and buy a better product!"
2,Not what I needed.,"I needed an fm transmitter to also charge my ipod touch 1st generation while it is playing, which this one does not."
1,Used & Dirty,Product showed up looking used and dirty. Haven't even bothered to try it out. Was supposed to be a gift for DH but this is gross.
2,warning,"i bought this and it worked great for like a day, but then every time i started using it it would shut off after about two minutes of playing music."
1,Good idea. Nice Design. Needs more power.,"I tried this since is was only a $10 purchase and I'm glad I didn't spend more money on it. The item works, but not very well. I even took my antenna off outside the truck so it wouldn't have other stations interfere with the sound. (In the past this helped with other FM Transmitters). However, this one still couldn't do it. Either there is something wrong with my iPod, or it just is weak as a transmitter. Given its size and that it runs off of the iPod battery, I believe the latter is the case.Also, since it doesn't plug into the headphones jack you can't control the volume. If you could up the volume some it would probably be OK. However, I had to turn my volume up to hear the music, and that also made the white noise louder, too.Currently, I'm using a little $12 Schoche battery powered transmitter from Wal-Mart and am more satisfied with its sound."
5,Works great for me!,This worked fantastic for me! The old itrip for the regular ipod required the installation of software; this doesn't. This was truly plug n' play. The sound is impeccably clear on my radio. Love it.
3,"It's ok, just ok, not terrible, not great...","Shipper was fast and accurate, well packaged, as described and very fast delivery. Product is ok, it does the job, feels kinda cheesy but not bad. It tends to hop into low power mode quite easily and you have to reconnect it to get a volume boost. I'd say this is the biggest minus with it. The Nano battery doesn't last long by itself I've found and this unit of course will drain it much faster. I'd say if you're getting 3 hours out of it you're doing very well. So it's not really any good for a huge road trip but a daily commute or up to about 150 miles it will work for you. Nice being able to play your ipod wirelessly in the car no doubt. It's not a bad product, just not all that great either. Decent enough I guess. Just glad I didn't pay what it was selling for upon its release a few years ago. But for the money now it's not a waste."
2,"Sound ok, low volume","Sound is ok but the volume is lower when I tested in the stereo of my car, if you like music loud pls don't buy this item."
3,Just OK,"So like many of its kind, the music is fuzzy and the quality of reception depends completely on the area you are driving through at any given time. If you want a cheap way to listen to your 2G nano and dont live in a built up area I say buy it. The device does look good and is seamless espcially with the silver nano."
4,iTrip Pocket = Solid FM Transmitter,"I tell ya, the only thing keeping me from giving the iTrip pocket 5 stars is the lack of a USB port for charging/syncing. My other issue with it is that the iTrip pocket didn't uncouple from my iPod nano as easy as I would have expected. Neither of these are a deal-breaker for me, though.The iTrip pocket is a solid FM transmitter and matches the form-factor of the iPod nano 2G's perfectly. I highly recommend it."
1,Battery Life...,The sound quality and ease of use were good enough. But! It drained the battery within an hour. There are better options out there... I suggest using one of those.
1,cute toy,"I had one whenever I was a kid, and I loved it. I recently ordered this doll for my sister."
5,awesome!,"it was great to find this rare barbie, wish the colors would have been traditional gators though. she was happy to get it!"
3,cute shoe,this is a very pretty sandal altho i had some problems with the beads snagging and falling off. its a good thing they knotted it in several places so not all of it came off. it's a little on the narrow side but my wide feet still fit well with it. it would have been perfect for an everyday shoe if it were half and inch lower tho. really like the rubber sole too which make it very stable.
5,Ruth Francis.,"Really nice glam rustic look with multitones,i dress up or down and however it looks fantastic."
4,I am 18 years old and I love to read...,"Vioalted is a definite must read. It tells of young girl who finally gets the courage to tell about her sexual abuse only to be blamed by everyone around her.It happens not just in poor families in Haiti, but in rich families here too. ALthough the voodoo and the mytery of Haiti made it a more scary read!"
4,I am a Junior High School teacher in Brooklyn...,"VIOLATED is a provocative rendition of life for a 9 year old girl emigrating from the ghettos of Port au Prince to Brooklyn,NY in the late 60's! It speaks strongly of all children transplanted from one culture to another.Violated includes elements of voodoo, incest, domestic volence...and through all that, the author finds a way to weave the unspoken love and care among the women of the pouchot family!The story is frightening at times, captivating allthe time! Highly recommend it."
4,Compelling and Very Insightful,"A friend recommended this book, and I read it in just one day.It was a compelling read, and touched on a similar theme and locale as Edwidge Danticat's 'Breath, Eyes, Memories'. The in-depth characterization and deft movement of the storyline made for a lively pacing."
1,nearly all the same,"Nearly every cover letter ends with ""I would like to discuss in greater detail the valuable contributions I would bring to ..."" and the opening sentences are also nearly all the same - very disappointing."
2,Not worth it,"Here's my cover letter for why it's not worth buying this book:""6 months of resume and cover letter writing during my job search is the experience that I can bring to the position of Bad Book Writer.""Every example follows the same exact cookie-cutter recipe, starting with this type of sentence. Not only are the sample letters of poor quality, but there is no information of substance as to how to craft a letter that is unique to my situation and prospective employer. The Power Impact Technique is simple a 2-step process that follows the cookie-cutter recipe."
3,There is good and bad this book,"I have been reading this book very closely and it does offer some good advice. However, in many instances, the book starts off with people who are highly experienced and does not offer much for people who don't have much experience or are still new to their field. I think this book fell a bit short in that aspect. It seems more like a book aimed towards people who have at least 10+ years of experience but does not have much advice and tips for new grads or people who are not very experienced. But still a good book to read for those who want to write a decent cover letter."
3,Keeps you guessing,"Here's another novel which focuses on sister-friends and relationship drama. The mysterious plot, hidden secrets, and flash backs to the past are what kept me intrigued. I wouldn't call this a stellar, but it definitely kept me up all night until I finished it. Two thumbs up to Ms. Perrin and her fine craft!"
4,The Strength of Sisters,"This is a story of sisterhood in good times and bad. The sisters of Theta Phi Kappa formed a strong bond while they were in college. They took up for one another, stood by each other's sides, and supported one another in times of despair.But...What would happens if one sister shows up at a sorority with another sister's one true love?What would happen if one sister is forced to face a grave mistake she committed in her past?What would happen if a sister goes against the advice of the others and carries on a relationship with a married man?The sisters of Theta Phi Kappa is a journey through the trials and triumphs of sisterhood between four ladies. The author embarked me on an exploration of the lives of these characters, weaving in a touch of romance, a hint of mystery, and a wealth of life lessons."
2,A long drawn out story about sisterhood and secrets,"I was so happy when I finished this book because I couldn't stand it. I just wanted to read the whole thing because I like to finish books. This book was supposed to be about sisterhood and friendship but these characters seem like they forgot the meaning of the word many times throughout the story. They were backstabbing each other, not respecting the code, and interfering in other people marriages and then in the same breath saying they respect the sanctity of marriage. Also one of the main characters were so needy she got on my nerves more than the other ones. She needed to get a backbone and stop letting older men bully her around. A lot of sappy friendship get togethers could have been left out. The little poems about the leaves are falling and this represent new birth could have been left out. If this book was supposed to make you want to have a group of girlfriends it did just the opposite for me."
1,The Sisters of Theta Phi Kappa,"This book starts off boring and slow then it continues to be boring and slow. I am more then half way throught it and I just want to skip to the back and see what the damn secret is!!! I have been reading this for more then a week. The book would not hold the attention of my 1st grader. Oh my gosh, why?"
3,Nice Read,This book was ok. It did drag on in certain spots and it took me a while to get through the book. I thought it would be more about sorority life. The only thing it demonstrated was the bond that they had and this could have been done with any group of women not just sorority sisters.
4,Pretty Good,This is the first book i've read by Kayla Perrin and i was impressed. It kept my attention but the reason i gave it four stars is because i had figured out what what the secret was and who was involved way before the book actually to told me...to predictable. other than that it wasn't bad.
2,Just OK,The title really fooled me. This book had nothing to do with the sorority. The story line would have been the same if the women weren't sorors. And the BIG secret-what a joke. It took me a month to read this. I only finished it because I paid for it.
3,so- so,"Although I am not familiar with the ""Sorror"" lifestyle, I feel that Ms. Parrin gives the reader a sneak-peak, if you will, into the scared sisterhood. I bought this book almost 2 years ago, an just got around to reading it. Was I overwhelmed, no, but all in all, the story held my attention until the end."
2,Okay,"Don't get me wrong, the actual summary, dialogue, and organization of the book were fine. But I was rather dissappointed that the ""secret"" had nothing to do with being in a sorority. Matter of fact, the whole sorority deal was just a way to connect the women. The title was a little misleading so when I found out the big secret, I was like ""Ugh, that's it?!"" I thought it was going to be some big pledging deal--instead it was something any extremely dumb, sensitive girl would've done. I also didn't understand why the messenger wasn't questioned which easily made me figure out who was behind the threats. There were MANY moments of sappiness towards the end that made me go ""Okay, you all are tight, move on with the story"" and after awhile, I just wanted it to end. It was okay, but I wasn't impressed."
3,Good Book!!,"Kept me in suspense for the 3 chapters, but it was pretty easy to figure out...still it was a good book."
4,mysterious and real life,"I enjoyed the book. I think sometimes the book read slow, but overall I can relate to the friendship isssues. I am a member of a sorority and I know how confict can arise when different personalities come together, she did a wonderful job displaying that. I also enjoyed the mysterious plot. I am an avid mystery reader as well. I think those two combinations are what kept me glued to the book all night."
3,OH MY!... Not an entire speech...,"The idea of the story was ok. However this book is too wordy. It contains an entire speech that one of the characters was making.WHY, WHY, WHY I do not need to read an entire speech, especially if it has nothing to so with the story.I found myself getting bored and the story moves a little slow at times.This is the first book that I read by Kayla Perrin. I will give her one more try. Hopefully it will be a better experience."
1,Did not enjoy...,"I was very troubled by this book. The claims that Lutzer was making were very rarely backed by Scripture, and he gave conflicting statements on topics in different parts of the book. I think any Christian experiences enough of Satan's influence in the world, not to have to study Satan in a way that does not feel Biblically sound."
2,Not as strong as advertized,"The linkage doesn't actually support the weight listed for the product (in our case, a small TV that was less than this weight), with the final (distal) hinge unable to hold the position, no matter how tightly it was cranked - the TV just gradually rotates downward). As a temporary solution, I've used a bungie cord as a spring to hold it in place, until we replace it."
4,"The plot of this Tarzan film is much like the others, but it is fun to watch","As usual with Tarzan films, the title of this movie is overstated; he does not express savage fury, although he does kill his enemy. It is fun to watch. This 1952 film is the sixteenth movie in the Tarzan series since 1932. It is the fourth of five films in which Lex Barker has the role since he followed Johnny Weissmuller in 1949. Two crooks with native carriers trick Tarzan into believing that one of them is his cousin. They try to persuade him to take them to a jungle tribe that has many diamonds. He refuses but, as usual, Jane gets him into trouble by persuading him to do so. En route, people get killed and the crooks steal diamonds. Jane is almost murdered by the tribe who think that she is involved. A new character, a lost white orphan is introduced; Tarzan brings him home and Jane says he can remain. Cheetah, as in the other films, does many funny tricks."
3,It's just okay,"I was hoping that with the individually sewn squares, the filling would not shift or clump like most down comforters. Although it's super warm all the filling still clumps up in the squares. I wish I had returned it but it's for a guest room so it hardly gets used. When I do prep the bed for company, I have to beat the filling in place. Bummer, keep looking."
1,this is retarded,"Tyler Perry is back. ""THE HOUSE OF PAYNE"" is againmore stupid than ever. *Uncle Curtis* is still keeping usin pain from beginning to end and ""Tyler"" is still leavingus with messages that anybody cares, while continuing to makeus mad at the same time.Keep Cooning TYLER BECAUSE IT WON'T LAST!!!!!!!"
5,House of payne,This movie was alot of fun to watch i will purchase furhter vols just waiting for a reduction in price.
3,shipping not so great!,"This item was shipped pretty fast but when I received the dvd, the disk was loose in the case and was scratched when I opened it."
5,"Tyler Perry's House of Payne, Vol. 2: Episodes 21-40",I love this show. It keeps my family laughing as well as relating to some of the issues presented.
4,House of Payne Volume 2,My daughter and I truly enjoy this series. The cast is too funny! Congrats to Tyler Perry!!
1,Now that's funny (Rated N),"This show has been rated the ""best comedy on cable"" by the very same organization that was insturmental in getting THE AMOS AND ANDY SHOW taken off the air. Now that's funny!!"
3,light weight and smaller than expected,"Forks were light in weight and smaller than I expected, wish I had ordred the dinner forks instead. Also I ordred two sets and each was a different pattern, I would have preffered them to match."
2,Sexist and Ridiculous,"I wanted a book that would help remind me of some values for Christian wives to hold on to, and to help keep my relationship with my husband strong. I was hopeful because of some of the reviews associated with this book; however, after reading several pages and scanning the rest of the book just out of curiosity, I realized this book would NOT work for me. This book makes women seem stupid and weak! I'm getting a Master's degree right now, and it talked about how women can't read large books!!! SERIOUSLY!!! I laughed a lot at the stupidity and weakness of this book. PLEASE find a better author. I gave it two stars, because it made me laugh."
5,Great for single women!!!,"I'm in the ""Career Class"" at my church...this class is for singles out of college, yet under 35. My Bible study leader gave this to me to help out in a completely different area of my life than that of husband/wife and it helped immensely. Because of the profound effect it had on me, my dear leader went on to purchase copies for all the dating girls in our class and I couldn't be more happy.If you are a Christian woman who is ready to be smacked with the truth and you are interested in the Progressive Sanctification mindset of GROWING and CHANGING...this little gem of a book is for you!WOOT! for Reformed Theology!!"
1,OH BOY!,"I read some of the things in this book to my christian husband and he said, ""If you ever act like that I will go crazy!"" There are little scriptures in this book, it is basically all opinion. In one part of the book she says you must make your breasts available to your husband at all times so he won't be tempted by other womans breasts. Wouldn't that just make him view you as a sex object even more? This book is an embarasment to the christian faith."
5,Great for Teamwork & Understanding,"I was discussing this book with a colleague who also read it, and we both came to the same conclusion. It's well-written, comprehensive, and detailed to the point that anyone at a large or small company in the semiconductor industry can benefit from it. We learned a lot, and I would recommend it to everyone in this sector."
2,Catchy title... but a waste of time and money,Nothing new to be learned. Just very simple superficial stuff.
4,"So far, so good","I have used this product for about 2 weeks and am very pleased with it. My paella didn't stick, which was one of the main reasons for my purchase. I really dislike losing so much rice to a pan that stuck. And my braises have turned out very well, a true one-pot meal, since this size fits my electric burner better than my larger 8.5 quart saucepot. This item is also lighter and has been truly nonstick (so far).I look forward to using this saucepot for more culinary adventures in the future!"
4,Bosch Countersink Set,This is a quality product and performs as expected. I would rather see Bosch eliminate the Phillips bits from the set and instead include a countersink depth stop.
4,Happy but not soo happy..,Its what I wanted but I thought the blinker lights wher also attach too it...But other then that Im satisfy...I think they should had been a little more specific about the item...But other then that Good Job...Keep up the Good Work...
5,An Interesting Take,"For those who aren't interested in a Lit Crit approach: Don't bother to read it, then complain that it's focused on Literary Criticism! If you bother to know what you're getting into however, and want to approach it not as a collection of horror stories but as a provocative take on what these ""little stories"" mean when applied to the broader cultural perspective, then I definitely recommend it. This is a well-written book by a very intelligent and engaging author."
1,Poor quality,"The quality is too poor. We are not experts in diamond, but these didn't even look like diamonds - extremely dirty and yellow. We returned it and got it from somewhere else."
4,Depends on what you want it for,"My husband likes to sit in his big recliner and watch TV with his laptop beside him or on his lap. I got him a wireless mouse and this pad, thinking he could use them on the chair arm, but it wouldn't stay put, and he finally decided that the mouse works just fine on the fabric of the chair arm, not the fault of the pad, but maybe you should think through how you're going to use it a little more than I did."
1,I hate this thing... waste of money!,"When I first got it, I like it. I moved it ONCE and it no longer stuck to the table, slid around with the mouse and became completely useless. Don't waste your money on this thing. Is a glorified, laminated piece of plastic crap."
2,Wow Does This Thing Slide Around,"It's supposed to have a patented sticky backing, but I find it does not stay in place as advertised."
2,Not so WOW,"Add my voice to the growing list of complaints about it sliding all around on the desk. Says you can wash it off and it will stick again, but that's not true. It's thin, but so what? If it slides around, it's useless."
2,Could be better...,"First, the things I like about this pad is that it has a very thin surface and is very easy to clean. However, as others have reported, my mouse cursor often jumps. I though I needed a new mouse and bought a new one. I still have the problem. It seems to jump only if the grid is not parallel to the desk. If the grid is at an angle, the mouse jumps. Unfortunately the sticky back is not very tacky which causes the pad to move an rotate very easily."
2,Slides on glass,It might work on some surfaces but it will not stick to my glass desk. It slides badly.
4,Nice,"Love it, however, slippery as hell. My mouse keeps sliding around and has even fallen off the mat onto the floor."
1,Product not as described,"I own another, larger WowPad with which I have been quite happy. Needing a new mousepad for work, I decided upon the slightly smaller version being sold here. To me, the phrase ""8.5 inch diameter"" along with the item picture implied this was a circular mousepad. It was not. The product I received was rectangular and roughly the size of a traditional mousepad. Also, I assumed the tracking surface would have a pattern similar to the photo. Instead, I received a mousepad with an image of Van Gogh's Starry Night - not exactly the image I was hoping to convey next to my multi-monitor setup.Operationally, this product works fine with my Razor DeathAdder mouse, but I was disappointed that the item's shape and surface image were far from how the product was described."
3,Has a limited lifespan,"I use this mouse pad with my Apple optical mightymouse. I really like how thin and sleek it feels on my desk, almost like you're not using anything at all. The mouse moves very smoothly. I can't rate it very high though because it wears out on me after about a month of daily use. I work at home and use it about 8 - 9 hours a day. No matter how I follow the cleaning instructions, the slippery surface just seems to wear away and get rough. So I just buy a couple at a time and keep replacing them."
4,Better than Expected,"For a mousepad, I am rather pleased. It is really thin, works very well with an optical mouse, and does not move all that much. Gice it a try, more than likely you appreciate its simplicity."
3,Better than earlier editions,"This 2006 version is arranged excellently and gives a lot of very detailed information. Like Rick Steves' book, it could use a better index. The Fodor choices are directed more toward the well-heeled traveler and seem to not go to the inexpensive places to stay or eat that must be out there. When we get back we will know for sure."
3,Don't purchase this card for a clunker PC it needs 450W power,"Well, this card had fantastic reviews when it was manufactured/released and the price was certainly wonderful at below $200 for a big video card. My intention was to stick it in an HP PC (HP M8300f AMD Athalon 64x2 dual core 3.0 Ghz 3G RAM 32 bit) that had an Nvidia 9500GT card to upgrade the graphics capability for rendering movies and videos. I knew there was an issue when the card arrived and it was huge. I didn't press the issue of trying to cram it in the tower, as I didn't want to damage the card or inadvertantly yank out some wiring on the motherboard. I haven't completely given up but now I have to ask an expert or technician to see if even with an upgraded power supply will this card fit in the motherboard and not set the machine on fire if I start it up. It sure looks nice there in the box. My wife wants to kill me."
4,"Neil Young, Heart of Gold",My husband saw this from a rental and liked it so well he purchased it. I watched it and liked it enough to purchase it for my daughter for a Christmas gift. She was happy to receive it as she had seen parts of it and said she had wished she owned it. The music is great and lots of other interesting scenes
4,Chilling,"The first half, the ""Prairie Wind"" stuff, is alright, doesn't do much for me, but the second half is excellent. The most chilling part of the whole show is an 8 minute long static shot of Neil playing ""The Old Laughing Lady"" before an empty auditorium while the closing credits roll, it's worth purchasing for that alone."
5,Saw this on pay TV and loved it,"Loved it so much, I bought the company. Kidding. Neil Young is a fantastic writer. He gives a lot of thought about the musicians and voices that bring his music to life, especially on stage. I really enjoyed watching this performance. Jonathan Demme did a terrific job of capturing this concert to bring it to us on DVD."
5,Comes A Time,"This concert film is a complete and total delight! If you know the background of this concert, then you know that Neil Young was soon to have brain surgery for an annurism when he opted to stage this event at the famed Ryman Auditorium. The players and singers he gathered for the event perform flawlessly and Jonathan Demme's direction is seamless. As for Neil himself, his singing is in top form and because of his life threatening condition, there's an aura of being 'in the moment' in his eyes and in some of his comments between songs. The first half of the concert is a showcase for songs from his new recording, PRAIRIE WIND. The second half is made up of many of his best songs from his acoustic repertoire, including HEART OF GOLD, OLD MAN, NEEDLE AND THE DAMAGE DONE, HARVEST MOON and even I AM A CHILD from his days with Buffalo Springfield. I've seen many, many concert films over the years and this one is as good as it gets........"
3,Disapointed,"I saw this some time ago when it was on TV. I decided I liked it so much that I would add it to my collection.Much to my great disapointment the video quality is terrible. The video is far more grainy than a SD DVD. I get better video quality over the air and on standard definition DVD's.Great artist, to bad thay couldn't do justice to the subject mater and code this DVD in a manner that would produce high quality sharp video. There is no excuse for this kind of poor DVD encoding. I produce better video with my Sony camcorder and over the counter video editing software on my home computer."
5,Outstanding!,"I rented this video from Blockbuster and never returned it. I simply could not part with it. I watched it over and over and finally went in and just paid them for it. Now, I'm buying copies for my friends. It will make a great Xmas gift."
5,DEEP THOUGHTS,Totally Excellent! This performace made me think and appreciate my life and the short time we have on this earth. We should be thankfull for our familys and friends as Neil tries to express this point through his music. The DVD was well done!
5,All around enjoyable.,First saw on HBO & so good wanted to hear at my convenience. Didn't even realize how much I like Neil Young. Many great singers featured with him.
5,Simply OUTSTANDING...,"If you're a Neil fan, this reflective work is a MUST for your collection. Great introspective newer material interspersed with heartfelt renditions of many old classics."
3,STRUMMIN' IN THE REAL WORLD,"I'll make no friends critisizing HEART OF GOLD as a dull concert movie. I liked the modern Nashville insight centered around the historic Ryman Auditorium, where Young and friends gather for a concert to premiere the album, PRARIE WIND, but the strength of this film is dependent on the success of Prarie Wind as an album, given it is played in it's entirety, and the music falls short of being outstanding, a sort of lesser, ""Harvest"", with routine Young acoustic melody, sentimental, less than profound lyrics, and war protest songs lacking inspiration and artistry. I'm glad Young is alive and well but Praire Wind is less a wind than a gust of crudely simple ideas and songcraft."
3,Neil Young - Heart of Gold,"After having watched Neil Young in West Berlin Video DVD, this one was much more sedate. He is aging and it may be best to see him as a younger performer with more energy."
5,Niel Young's Heart of Gold,"This album is a classic. Neil Young, while no philosopher, is one heck of a song writer. He evokes images that stir tthe memories, good and bad. He puts these images to beautiful music with top musicians and singers.Unfortunately there are gratis ""coming attractions"" for some truly degenerate movies before the Young album starts; but they can easily be skipped through using the right buttons. It's as if the producers refuse to let normal people go without THE revolutionary message.Along with the entertainment, is a supplimentary album which focuses on the performers and how the album came to be. Everyone recognizes the greatness of Young's talent and I have to agree."
5,Neil at his best,This DVD made me want to go out and get a cowboy hat and a guitar. If you like Neil Young and a big sound (over 20 people performing on stage at the same time) get this one!
4,What A Guy,"This is a great DVD if you like Neil Young and his music, his connection to his music and band is evident as is his enjoyment of performing, good DVD."
3,Neil Young - Heart of Gold,When the dvd arrived after nearly one month wait it was not made to be played in this region of the world. the case was written in Italian. I contacted the original seller of the dvd and they apologized and refunded my money very quickly. I was unaware that dvds are made for different regions of the world.
2,Great concert but grainy video!,"I love Neil Young's Music. The performance is fantastic! Five star for the music. Viewing this DVD in large screen is a big mistake! I don't believe how grainy the film is and the horrible sound quality! I am really disappointed with the video and the audio quality! I have no problem with ""The Last Waltz"" on the large screen! That is an excellence production! Sadly to say this is a poorly conceived production that inhibit my viewing pleasure of Niel Young and his music. I respect a well produced artistic production, the grainy effect only works when it is done correctly! This effect was like an after thought added to counter a very stylized production by a first year art student."
5,Neil Young Heart of Gold,"Neil Young has a heart of gold when it comes to writting heartfelt songs and performing and that's all here. This video belongs in the Library of Congress as true American Music written by a foreigner...(And Arnold S. should be allowed to run for president...another subject). I love Neil Young, seen him numerous times, loved him since Buffalo Springfield days. I don't care if he is a horrible tipper. This is great product for anyone interested hands down."
4,"I HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SPELL OF, ENCHANTED BY NEIL YOUNG SINCE THE LATE SIXTIES.","That said, this dvd did not represent what I love about Neil Young. I gave it 4 stars anyway. This was done in Memphis at the home of the Grand Ole Opry----not my favorite genre. Some beautiful old songs were played, but not enough. The first half is his attempt at a country thing. But, I like watching and hearing him. Hence, the 4 stars. There is a second disc with interviews and history. The mood of this performance has something to do with issues and circumstances of his life and health at the time. He's allowed. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE COUNTRY AND REALLY LIKE NEIL YOUNG. I really like NEIL YOUNG.The second disc has a performance of one song from a 1971 JOHNNY CASH TV program. A BEAUTIFUL, PURE NEIL YOUNG SINGS ""THE NEEDLE AND THE DAMAGE DONE"". I REALLY LIKE NEIL YOUNG!"
5,Heart of Gold DVD is fabulous!,"This is a deeply spiritual, beautifully filmed and recorded, wonderful musical journey. I""ve watched it intently and also listened to it in the background. Either way is a pleasure. It's hard to explain just how much I love it."
4,Tradition doesn't Fail,Elaborate when required....This DVD is is a pleasure to behold...I actually got a nicer feeling for this artist..I worked with these artists in the 60's and I think maturity is real...
2,It takes too long to work.,This stuff takes days to take effect. Go see a dermatologist instead. They have prescription products that relieve ingrown hair faster and more effectively.
2,Have merci...,"Don't hate this product's producer(s) for hurting our ears with this unfortunate and shrieking combination of voice and harp. Have merci with Caterina Valente The Great, one of the finest singers of the 21st century, whose unique oeuvre makes this pompous pretentiousness easy to forgive."
5,Great skin care product I have ever used,"Love this product, my skin feel soft, moist and not greasy or sticky. I would recommend this product to anyone who experience dry skin in winter season. I believe this product also good for any season. I used it daily to keep my skin from drying out from winter dry air."
5,My New Favorite Moisturizer,"I tried this item first when I got it as sample gift that came along with my order of Aqua Derm Essence. My skin is combination skin in which get very oily during the Summer time and very dry U-zone during winterI started getting breakouts with L'occitane brand and getting flacky skin due to harsh winter weather.So I started using this product and voila my skin was back to normal with balaced moisture and no more flaky skin.I think this product forms the barrier agains the dry and cold air to keep the moisture balanced. so after finishing this sample contatiner I ordered the big one. My husband also uses it because it has no ""feminie"" scent to it and men's skin care was not giving him enough moisture. Also bought one for my mother to try it."
2,why this?,"if this is just collagen gel, why do you not buy it from amerimark at about $6.00 an ounce? isn't collagen, collagen?"
1,Don't waste your money. This is a biggest joke!!!,"Terrible product. you can't even say it's a skincare. Your face will have a full of trouble for sure. Guarantee!!! I contacted their head office in japan, but horrible customer service and ungenerous treatment were given instead of any advises. I saw their official website. They are out of business. Don't trust. This product is just watery glue.Nothing to do with your skin."
3,Good observations,"Its a good reading. Although the book is decorated with endless academic jargon, it presents the modern history of Bangladesh in a less-biased way. The authors style is very academic and he looks at the political set-up in a secular way. The reader can actually feel there is a sort of leftist touch when he sees that the author is referring to Gramsci not infrequently. But then the author is determined to explain the forces and motivation behind the ruling clique in a socio-political structure. I liked his observations."
4,Steamy drama starring Javier Bardem,"""Second Skin"" is the follow up film to Javier Bardem's Academy Award Nominated performance for Best Actor in ""Before Night Falls"" . In ""Second Skin"" Bardem again plays a gay man but this time he's in love with a married man. This Spanish language drama is a tense love triangle that you won't soon forget. The film also stars two of Spain's most famous actors ""Cecilia Roth (""All About My Mother"") and Ariandna Gil ( ""Belle Epoque""). This is a film that will appeal to Bardem fans as well as fans of classic love triangles. But most of all it will have a strong appeal with gay consumers because of Bardem's strong presence."
4,"Excellent actors, very real","Didn't give 5 stars because of the ending wich I didn't like(won't tell you how it ends!)It worths to be seen,great erotic scenes, great love story"
3,Mouse,"While this mouse has a great feel to it, I find that the programmable buttons do not function as advertised. I have always used Logitech products where the programmable buttons work perfectly - not that big of a deal but if you use the mouse for other then gaming, its a pain"
1,Service from Allergy Be Gone,I ordered these filters in December 2008 and in February 2009 still hadn't received them. I left a negative seller feedback and ABG contacted me about getting the filters out to me. It is now May 2009 and I have yet to receive the filters I ordered. Their complete Customer Service Department seems to be lacking so if you do order something make it simple. One item - one order. Maybe someday I'll actually get my order completed.
5,Viper what can I say,Viper makes a great product and this is no exception. I'm installing it my 98 Cobra so I don't need a remote start and some of the other bells and whistles included in the higher end units. Once the install is complete I'll comment again.
2,Does too much,"The product is great if you want a very touchy, overly-sensitive, loud alarm system. But it locks and arms way too quickly. I ALWAYS had to hit the unlock button just so the alarm wouldn't go off from leaving the car for 30 seconds. Also this DOES NOT FIT ALL CARS. I didn't have a bypass module (which is around $100 or so) so I had to keep my stock key fob to actually unlock the car. Overall I regret buying the item, there's a reason why they've made better and newer versions, the newer versions are a worth while investment."
2,It's okay...programming is limited,"It's a good basic alarm but I don't like the on board shock sensor. This makes it difficult to mount the brain in an ideal location under the dash without compromising the sensor sensitivity. If you want to take advantage of the programming feature, you need a bit writer. This can be expensive...another way the manufacturer makes more money. In the end, I returned the unit for another alarm brand."
1,Muy bueno,"El disco esta muy bueno, pero como toda marcha se va aburriendo con el tiempo. Este periodo de tiempo es muy corto, es decir, escuchas la marcha 3 veces y te aburris ya que las marchas duran 5 minutos de lo mismo y se repite y se repite y te aburris, asi que no te compres el disco, mejor bajate el mp3 porque ARRRGGGG! El disco es muy malo, mejor comprate el de santana"
5,Simple to use for the novice wallpaper,My husband and I have never wallpapered anything before. We were nervous but this was very easy and forgiving. It is the perfect border for the parents who still want pink but not baby-pink. The darker colors offer a nice contrast to all of the other baby-pink you inevitably get when people know you are having a girl.
3,Just okay,I was expecting a bit better actually for the money I paid. I even tried using honing oil but I am not impressed. The stone is wearing away too quickly.
5,The Elevator Family,I like the book The Elevator Family.Because it is on my reading level so it is a 4.0 book.If thats your reading level you got to read this book.I mean they stay in a hotel eleavator called Otis on the way they meet lots of people.
4,quirky and sweet,"I read it to my 6- and 7-year-old granddaughters in a little over an hour. It took a few pages before they were into it, but they ended up thinking it was funny. It sparked their imaginations and provided some interesting food for thought. It wasn't totally riveting, but enough so that they kept wanting another chapter until the end."
5,The Elevator Family,"I got this book as a gift from my older sister 6 years ago and never found the time to read it for some reason but 2 days ago I read the book and was sorry I hadent all these years its not very long and should'nt take much time at all. But it was a really was a cute book for younger kids and its about a family named the Wilsons who find that there are no rooms in the hotel they are staying at so they stay in a elevator they call Otis. They meet lots of guests who are staying at the hotel and for some reason its kind of funny if you ask me the Wilsons dont really seem to mind that they are staying on and elerator or that they are on one but they say it has its ups and downs the end of the book its interesting when they find out a girl is kidnapped but I wont give anymore away over all its a good book as Walter says ""only the best will do."""
1,Just Plain Stupid,"Wow what a bad book! Im serious this book was the stupidest thing I've ever put my hands on. Dont order this book because you can have it for free just grab a shovle and go to the desert there's plenty copies of it burried under the sand. First off what kind of family Goes to a hotel and rents the elavator instead of a room. Then the family doesn't seem to have a problem with evryone geting on and off the elavator, they just play pick up sticks with evryone that gets on and off.Then around the last three pages the author decides he wants this to be a mystry book. I lost 99.9% of my dignity reading this book before i got to the second chapter. Dont even look at the cover you will scared for life. Trust me on this one."
1,Inconsistent Used to be good.,"If you order this on a regular basis, They will send you something called ""Butterscotch Toffee"" half the time instead of the butterscotch you ordered which is very bitter. If you complain to the only person that works there, she will INSIST it is the same thing. It is not. Even when you point out the fact that BOTH varieties are on their website with different descriptions and very different prices. Also, your order will be fresh coffee once in a while. When it is fresh, it is wonderfully fragrant. When it is not fresh, well, there is no nice smell lingering anywhere. If they make a mistake on your order, they will do everything possible not to permit an exchange. Take it from somebody that has 18 years ordering experience from this company...."
2,Great book to learn from but poorly put together,Mr. Blizter does a great job explaining everything in such detail that anyone should be able to understand the topic. My problem is the book is falling apart at the bind. It is not put together as well as it should be for a product that costs over a hundred dollars. The book is always put in a safe place where nothing can mess with it and it is not thrown around or bent in any way. I open my book today to study and it seperates at the bind.This is a dissapointing product in terms of material quality. The inside is a great learning tool for College algebra and I recomend it only if they don't skimp on quality.
3,Some of the Pictures Are Good,"I like some of the pictures. But where the days are shown, I like them to start with Sunday and finish with Saturday. This calendar starts with Monday, and finishes with Sunday. And it shows the dates just with little numbers. There are no boxes to write in. Not the best calendar for kids, because it's hard to read the days."
1,Little Information,"I was disappointed in my purchase of this ebook because of the lack of information that it provides about the author. I was hoping to read a biography of Jean Plaidy and instead found something more like a bibliography. It provides a list of the work that she has done, but even this I found was not entirely complete. Most of the writing about her just describes what critics thought about her different books, and I learned nothing new about her. The ebook does not even tell you her exact date of birth or her husband's full name, and gives no other family information other than her parent's names. Internet research will give you a lot more info than this book can."
2,It's ok,"It's a good book, but there's nothing there you couldn't get from much cheaper and more modern sources. Do people still use SAS, anyway?"
1,Too redundant!!!,"I had hoped that it would turn out to be at least a good book (if not excellent) by seeing such big names in the list of authors but am terribly disappointed! The table which normally could have been printed in a fraction of page has been printed on a complete page. Even if that was not enough, 5-6 pages continuously filled with 5-6 tables (all displaying the same meaning) can be commonly seen throughout the book. There is a terrible amount of repetition in printed matter also.It seems (though might be unintentionally) that a lot of stress has been given to enhance the page count of the book while giving almost no consideration to the quality of the material.In addition, a lot of important matter (for example non-linear time series models) have just not been covered."
4,it worked 4 me,"I found that when I played by the ""rules"" in the book I won about 60% of the time which is better than I usually do. I think the book is fun, and very informational for a novice on how to get started online, handle your banking and things. The discussion forum linked to their website was very helpful. It looks like they are improving the strategy people give feedback. I think real gamblers will not be happy with this book because it takes most of the gamble out of the equation. Makes it a bit boring - but it made me money."
2,"Interesting, but flawed idea","The main argument of the author is that online casinos are different from land ones, so you need to adopt a different strategy in order to have a chance of winning. So this book describes a specific approach with the aim of accomplishing this. It's a interesting idea, but, ultimately, it doesn't work. The problem is that the 'systems' in this book are nothing more than very basic progressions; there is nothing really clever or innovative here. Another thing is that, according to the author, his approach only works on two types of casino software - the others are apparently 'unbeatable' because they cheat. All this is very unsatisfactory. Anyway, I tried the system and didn't do well except on baccarat; blackjack was a huge disappointment and craps very slow going. The next book in this series will be on poker - hopefully it will be a lot more effective than this one."
3,I expected more,"I excpexted more from thos title.. I have read and loved the other books in the Starfist series and absolutely love them. Force Recon however was just not the same caliber.. Sure it takes place in the StarFIST universe and even revolves around the main story arcs, but there are character discrepencies with a few of the main characters and the flow is very much not in ceeping with the originals... That said, if you want 1980's action style hereos Mary Sueing their way across the galaxy, this my friend is your book."
2,Self Promotion Thy name is either Dan Cragg or David Sherman,AArgg.. I'm increasingly disgusted by the authors self-promotion. In each of their books it gets worse! This time there is almost a chapter dedicated to refering to the authors other works and worse yet refering to starfist!!!Pat yourselves on your backs some other way guys. It's shameless and tacky the way your doing it now.As for the rest of the book....Simplistic with sci fi techno toys thrown in to liven up the plot. The main series is better but as filler Force recon isn't bad.Buy the book used or borrow it from your local library. It ain't worth the full price.
5,"Funnier than Dr. Ruth, more powerful than the right wing...","This book had me in hysterics from beginning to end.It says it all, and does it with much humor.If your mom says ""But honey, why?...."" give her this book.In fact, look up Ms. Roberts' other books and givethem *all*. You won't be sorry. You'll be laughing, andso will your mom. <G>"
1,what's the fuss?,"not only is it stereotypically negative, but shows society how irresponsible we are in relationships. it adds overall to society's view of us as partner switchers, unable to maintain commitment, irresponsible, and irratic. Seems to typify what you would find in the bar scene which doesn't include the rest of us."
4,Table Top Football (flashback to school days),This is a geat toy. It takes you back to your younger years when you actually made this toy with pieces of paper. It is so much fun...I felt like I was back in school playing football over my desk with a classmate.
3,If Magic Is Your Thing...,"This book was short on useable content and is geared more for the person wanting gimicks and tricks to attract people passing by on a busy trade show floor. I think that some of the tricks he shares do have value in driving your point home but pursuading people who don't want to be persuaded... so, so. I'm glad he made tons of money as a magician/entertainer and just made more on a less than stellar writing venture. I believe this could be used as a platform to begin being creative in you own enviroment."
2,How to ENTERTAIN people,"Despite being quite a nice read, this book does not live up to it's title!Rather than being a book on 'How to persuade people who don't want to be persuaded', it explains in great detail how to entertain people who want to be entertained - and use it to drive home your point in the process.This book is probably most valuable to you if you are in the entertainment business, or have a talent as an entertainer that you want to exploit in a business setting. It will certainly make your arguments more LIVELY - but it has to fit your style, otherwise the techniques will be useless to you.Being a psychology student myself, I prefer the hardcore scientific approach so I ordered Cialdini's Influence after finishing this book. Looking forward to reading that."
1,FlimFlam at Best,"Glad I only borrowed this book from the library. It was a waste of time. It was completely flimflam, conman, pitchman, pick one. There was very little usable content in the book. Look elsewhere. While the author may be good in person, the writing leads much to be desired."
2,"Lot of show, not much substance","As my review title indicated, the book is somewhat entertaining, but ""where's the meat?"" would be a good subtitle. If you do trade show pitches, it's more applicable. If you don't do trade show pitches, there's some value, but not worth the effort."
4,A funny and short comic strip book drawn and written by Buke,"This is a series of drawings/cartoons with a storyline about a snowstorm in LA. Charles Bukowski is the cartoonist and author. It has funny bits in it and the pictures are childlike but offer another look at Buke and his art. It is short and for the obsessive collector it is a must. It can be found in an online form on a search of Charles Bukowski. It is worth a look but unless you find an autographed copy don't spend more than a few bucks for it. If the demand grows for this work John Martin at Black Sparrow Press will most likely get a hold of it and put it out. He is the Buke guru and has the lionshare of Bukes work. John got Buke out of the Post Office. Bukwosk rules and this is a funny book for the avid collector. Find it if you can and remember Bukes immortal words ""Don't Try""."
2,5 star show - dismal service,"What gives?! The product listing for Unbox said you'd deliver videos with DVD quality. They look more like YouTube quality videos. Seriously, they're not even as good as plain old standard TV. They would have looked pretty OK on my iPod, but they weren't much fun to look at on my 42"" LCD screen. Everything was soft and fuzzy in most scenes and the tonal scale was very limited. Just so you know, DVD quality isn't an arbitrary standard-- it's 480P, not 240x160.To make things even less enjoyable, your servers delivered the product at an excruciating pace. Ready to watch in 15 minutes?! No. More like three hours. There was the occasional burst of data at 1500 Kbps, but it was generally around 400 Kbps. I ordered eight 42 minute episodes more than 24 hours ago and am still downloading the last one. Not impressive."
5,Glovers Baseball/Softball Score Sheets,"I could not be sure exactly what Glovers package this was until it arrived. It is BB-101: 50 Refill Sheets only which is what I wanted since I had previously gotten the binder and the 30 score sheets plus the other helpful stat sheets which I did not need at this time. The actual shipping weight reported for UPS purposes was only 1.6 lbs and not the 3.2 lbs in the description. Glovers big 11"" tall by 14"" wide sheets are easy to work with when you have their binder."
1,Exclibur Electronic NY53CS New York Times Touch Screen Sudoku Game,This item needs improvements to make it user friendly.The screen is VERY difficult to see. Back lighting would be a welcome addition.The start-up numbers should be distinctive. The player should be able to distinguish them from the selections he enters.
5,A must buy,"As a student of American history, I have not seen a better book that gives you an overview of American history. No this encyclopedia will not go in-depth on everything you want, but is merely a general look at our nation's history. If you want an in-depth study you do need to look for a book that deals with that issue, but if you want a good general book, this is the one to get. I believe it is a must get for any student of history, especially American history. And if you just like American history as a hobby, this book is still a must get."
2,"The most self-important, and annoying serial hero yet","This guy even sings! If I'd written the script, when he bursts into song on an airplane (in the first chapter), the passangers would've ganged up on him and threw him, sans parachute, off the plane. Then, of course, Noah Beery, Jr. would've had to battle the Dragon all by himself...That would've made for a more entertaining 13 chapters in my mind.Actually, this is the first serial I've seen where I was hoping, starting with the 2nd chapter, that the hero failed to survive the preceding chapter.Okay, there are some great aerial sequences here, and if you can stomach the hero, it's a fair action serial. But there are a lot of better ones around."
2,Hansgrohe must translate to plastic from German,"I purchased many coordinating products in the Axor Uno line. Based on the price charged, style, the pictures I saw, and German manufacturing, I thought I was getting a quality product. However, I am very disappointed as much of it is over-priced, chromed plastic junk. I contrast Hansgrohe with the items that I purchased from a huge, well-known plumbing fixture company. I was skeptical of this other company due to their pricing, which was also quite high and their items did not appear as style-forward (which for some reason seems to always result in higher prices). This other company's plumbing was beautiful when it arrived and they certainly didn't skimp on the copper. I will not buy Hansgrohe again or purchase purchase plumbing fixtures on-line without checking them out in-store first."
3,so so,It fits the vehicle. But it is very thin and it fades quickly. Since it is so thin it collapses with rain water and creates a pond in the middle.
3,Power Wheels Cover,"This product was for the larger (12v) Vehicles. It swallows the Barbie 2 passenger jeep that we have, but it does it's purpose to cover product from the elements."
5,Great Cover,I was very excited to find this product. It is durable and stays on during inclement weather.
3,Only for Beginners,Suitable for beginners - techniques were fundamental - scenes were a bit too simplistic - enjoyed background of scenes but Frank got carried away with the folksy approach
4,Fabulous!,I got this press for Christmas and I love it! I would reccomend using a thick enough bread so that the insides of your sandwhich get warm before the outside of the bread gets too toasty. I have been doing weight watchers for a few months and this is a great tool for making a regular old sandwhich something much more tasty and satisfying!
4,pretty awesome!,friend gave as a housewarming gift - have had it for a week but have used it twice already!!!! pretty awesome paninis - no need to go to panera or anywhere!
4,Made a great gift,"I bought this for a friend who had never used a panini machine. I picked this one because of the way the lid pivoted, allowing for even pressure on thick or thin sandwiches. My friend loves the machine and I looked pretty good for picking this one out. The only thing that would make it better would be removable grills so she could wash them in the sink. As it is, it's one of those ""wipe it off"" things and you never really get it clean that way."
3,Hamilton Beach 25450 Panini Press,I really like the look of this appliance and it does toast great paninis. The only thing I find wrong with it is that the green light never lights up to indicate that the press is ready. I just put the sandwiches in after the requisite 6 minutes. If I waited for the green light I'd still be waiting.
4,Very good panini maker for great price,I liked this product from day one and I use it everyday. Really happy with the purchase. Reason for 4 stars is that I haven't used it for long. Will change rating after 6 months.
5,Everything you need,"I was pleasantly surprised at how great this panini press works. I got this as a present for my wife for Christmas, and she has been thrilled. She thinks I paid a lot more than I did also. It does not have adjustable temperature, but I think that it preforms super. We had a sandwich maker before, but we both like these paninis more. Easy to clean, stylish looks; I am very pleased with this product."
3,"Good just for paninis, will burn anything else!!!","You can't set up a temperature, so it's ok for making paninis, but if you want to grill anything else(chicken, fish) the temp. is to high and it burns them quickly."
2,Not so good,Not so great the surface is not flat. I hoped that the heat surface was flat to make better sandwiches.
2,Too Hot To Handle,"I received this panini maker for Christmas and although it is very reasonably priced and does a pretty good job, it doesn't have some of the basics that one would expect when cooking. There's a very short cord, no ""on/off"" switch. You plug it in and let it go....but you had better watch it b/c it heats up quickly and there are no settings at all. It's ALL or NOTHING!"
2,Flimsy,"This is a very flimsy product. It seems like it might come apart at any moment. What's worse, it has a very very short power cable, and no on/off switch. If the plug's in the socket, it's on.I will actually have to go through the trouble of sending it back. Do not purchase. It is designed by evil people."
4,Works Fine,"Does exactly what it was meant to do at a reasonable price. The booklet says to let it preheat for 6 minutes, and that's exactly how long it took. The bread came out nicely ridged and crunchy (like panini's are supposed to). Just don't make a ""Dagwood"" sandwich and you don't have to worry about the filling not getting hot. Works well for $29.99."
1,Doesn't heat all the way through,"This panini press is just a glorified grilled cheese sandwich maker, but it doesn't heat all the way through to melt the cheese before burning the bread. There's no on/off switch and no heat adjustment settings, which makes it very inconvenient. You're better off buying a skillet and using a stovetop...at least you can adjust the heat settings and cook your food all the way through. Waste of money."
2,Good while it lasts,"We received this second hand from a family member who rarely used it. Our first 10 sandwiches came out great, then it just stopped working. The lights don't work and the grill won't heat. I searched the grill to see if there was a reset button but there are none. Since I don't have a receipt, there is nothing else to do but toss it. I'll try a higher rated brand next time."
5,Panini Press,"Love this thing, I make egg omelets all the time and it does wonders, I also cook frozen grilled chicken patties, and burritos with ease. I was expecting it to have an on/off switch but it didn't have one, I would have to pull the plug to turn it off. To preheat just wait a minute or two to warm up. Overall, its great."
4,"Nicely priced, multi-use grill","Excellent value because it's not just a panini press -- you can also use it as a contact grill for vegetables, burgers, etc. You do this by using a set screw to lock the upper plate at the height you want. Bingo: buy one appliance rather than two.The upper plate has about 3"" to 4"" of travel, so you can press fairly thick sandwiches. The size is nicely compact, with the overall dimensions not much bigger than the heating plates.The plates have very fine ribbing, so you can't use this grill to fry eggs or pancakes. If you want those options, consider the Breville SG620XL panini press/grill (which has flat plates that lock into 6 positions), or the smaller Hamilton Beach 25219 Contact Grill."
3,"Bread is Done, Sandwich Fixin's Are Not","Mechanically, the press has a nice design and it works OK for a $40 item. The upper lid is not hinged, so it can be raised very high to accomodate thick sandwiches. Bread comes out nicely ridged and crunchy. It does take a while for the unit to heat to cooking temperature, however. The main problem seems to be how to cook the inside of the sandwich without burning the bread; for an average sandwich (3 oz. ham and 2 oz. cheese) after 1.75 minutes the bread is done, but the ham is not sufficiently warm nor the cheese melted. This may be an issue with all lower-end panini presses, I suppose; perhaps some experimentation with different bread types and cooking times will solve my little dilemma. In any case, so far the resulting sandwiches are better than if served at room temperature, but not as good as those heated in my toaster oven and then slapped together."
2,Disappointing.,The press did make delicious sandwiches. Until the spring broke and the nonstick liner started coming off on the sandwiches. We only had it about 2 months before we had to throw it away. Very disappointing.
4,"Great panini grill, but tough cleaning","I really like the grill, it heats up in about 5 minutes and the sandwich grilling time is about 2-4 minutes. Sandwiches are grilled really well. My only complaint is that it is not easy to clean as the plates don't come off, so they have to be cleaned in place. Also, the top grill surface (at least for my item) is not totally nonstick, so it cannot be cleaned properly."
1,Waste of money!!!,I wish I had read all of the reviews before I purchased this product as a shower gift for a bride. I learned today that it worked for one month and now has completely stopped working!!! I have owned my panini maker for over 10 years. This is astoundingly poor quality and now I have read many reviews here saying they had the exact same problem. This is completely unacceptable. Amazon should pull this product from their inventory!!
1,Impossible to clean!!!,"I bought this panini maker about 4 weeks ago and I cannot use it any longer. I have tried to clean it after every use yet it's become so dirty and nasty after only a few use. I have no idea how people say ""easy to clean""!!! it is not easy, it's impossible specially the upper suface.This panini maker looks really good (that's the reason for my one star) but is made of cheap material. I have used ONLY the (cheap and thin) scraper that came with this panini maker and after a few use there are already scuff marks and scratches.Many reviews get written by biased and paid people! don't believe everything you read!"
3,Non-Stick Surface Didn't Stick Around,"I was disappointed to find that the Hamilton Beach 25450 was another product for which the Chinese cut corners on quality in order to increase the profit margin.Specifically, after a few uses the non-stick coating came off in small pieces and stuck to the food as it was cooking. To salvage the product, I removed as much of the non-stick coating as I could. I now wrap food in aluminum foil, which seals in the ""juices"" when grilling meat."
2,good and bad ..,"this was a gift from my daughter, who knew i wanted a pannini grill .. the worst feature is that you cannot remove the plates to clean them properly .. the best is that the top locks into place so you can prevent smooshing your sandwiches ..if used just for panninis, this is such a nice item and the price is even better now that it is lowered to 28$ ..but, still, it is a pain to clean if you grill anything other than just a sandwich (chicken, steak .. )"
2,not my thing,got as a gift for Christmas and after using several times wish I didn't have it. Clean up is a hassel. Its heavy and does not come apart so you have to struggle with it to wipe it down well. It does heat well and the indicator light is nice but I just would rather not have it cluttering up the counter or cupboard and will pass it on when I have an appropriate recipient
1,Bad packaging ..both handles were broken,"We had same model for several years and really liked it. We decided to introduce our son and daughter-in-law to paninis, so gave press to them and ordered a new one. Right out of the factory box, the handle was broken in two places. Had to have been packaged at factory with handle broken! Poor quality control....Hamilton Beach! We returned, thanks to Amazon great return policy."
1,Cheap Junk,"Although I purchase many items on Amazon.com, this item is one that I have purchased at a local brick and mortar store twice in the past six months. Both times the machine has only worked for a couple of months before it completely stops working.The price is great, but if I were to continue to repurchase it would cost me several hundred dollars per year. Buyer beware, the price is nice, but the quality lacks.I have decided to by a panini pan for stove-top use. I am tired of kitchen gadgets such as this one that just don't last."
3,Dissapointed,Tried doing simple grilled cheese sandwiches several times with less cheese each time=same result. Cheese squeezed out on to grill sticking & making a mess.
5,"works great, thiking of buying a second one!!","we got this machine for our cafe to make paninis on our homemade foccacia bread. we've been using it for close to a month so far, and it's great! heats up and is ready in the time it takes me to assemble a sandwich for grilling. we don't load too much in the sandwiches, some simple cheese/meat or veggie/cheese combinations, everything comes out hot and melty, the bread gets nice and toasty with those classic panini grill lines...we'll get busier as summer approaches and we're already thinking of buying another one to make sure we keep orders coming out of the kitchen in a timely manner.just remember you have to plug it in to turn it on and unplug it to turn it off. so far this has been no hassle, even during a busy lunch."
2,Stopped working,I purchased this item 2 years back. I have used this about 4-5 times. Now my machine does not even start when plugged in. It was a good product as long as it was working but I have no clue why it stopped working. I have to ship it back to HB for repair.
2,Died after a couple of uses,I have owned this machine for about a year now. I might have used it less than 6 times and the panini maker does not start up now. I hope Hamilton beach is able to service it for free.
3,Hard to clean,"I love this press, it's cheap and works well. The only thing is that I wish it had removable plates because it is horrible to clean."
2,While it worked it was nice,"I had a great time making food with this grill while it worked! Only six months later and it doesn't work when I plug it in. I don't know why it's broken, but when I would unplug this I usually saw bright sparks. I don't think that's a good sign. I hate how there is no on/off switch. Also, it heats unevenly. The front gets burned faster than the back. I think I will be getting a more expensive press soon.Anyhow, I'll share my favorite low carb recipe. Take Mission Low Carb Wheat Tortillas, spread pizza sauce on and sprinkle some mozzarella. You can add whatever to make your style of pizza. Basil, sliced tomatoes, chicken. Just leave it on there for 4 minutes or until the tortilla is nice and crisp. Make sure the top press is just hovering above- you don't want to splatter your pizza sauce everywhere. When it's done, take it off and cut it up!"
2,Panini press,"This is a wondwerful item,but was misled in editors review that the grill area was 13 1/2 x 11 1/2,which it is not,I would not have purchased item if I would have known it was only 12 1/2 x 8 1/2 which makes alot of difference on how many sandwiches you can cook at one time."
1,Woked great for 6 months... then died.,"We enjoyed this unit while it was working. Last night it just died in the middle of cooking dinner for the kids.I called Hamilton Beach this morning, and they kindly offered to replace the unit under warranty... for $15 s&h.; That is literally half of the cost of a new unit.This is a disgusting policy. I will not buy a Hamilton Beach product again.Hamilton Beach 25450 Gourmet Panini Press"
3,Good Product but be careful!,"The machine works great and makes very fresh sandwiches. A word of caution, the external part of the press gets extremely hot. I briefly grazed my arm on the top part and got a bad burn. Keep away from children and allow sufficient time to cool off before handling."
4,Great Panini Press,My husband and I use this at least twice a week. We love it. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have an on/off button. Otherwise it is a great product.
5,"""Best Thing since the Panini Iron""","I propose we retire the expression ""best thing since sliced bread"" in favor of "" Best things since the HB Panini Iron"" . It is the best thing to happen to sandwiches in a long long time!"
5,GREAT GIFT,"I am giving this as a gift to my bachelor son. We were at friends a few months ago, and they had this product. Every day the panini press was used and my son loved it. It was a fast and easy way to make a gourmet sandwich or an easy tortilla cheese melt. Great for 1 person for a fast meal and easy clean up. My friends have had it for a few years and it gets used often. Still looked like new."
5,Great product,"Excellent product - really like the feature that you can ""lock"" the lid in a semi-open position to top broil cheese on pizza, etc."
4,Makes paninis,"Not much to say really, it makes paninis. It is well built and seems like it'll hold up for a while.The power cable is really short, but then again all small kitchen appliances have short cables."
5,Hamilton Beach Panini Press,Purchased for my 14yr. old granddaughter who enjoys cooking. She's very happy with it; started with quessadillas and advanced to paninis for family and friends. Fun!
5,Really nice panini press,Panini maker is fantastic. I took it to work and make quick sandwiches for the employees. Toasts them in no time and easy clean up.
4,Panini Press,I am very happy with my panini press. We use it several times a week. Fast good hot sandwiches and easy clean-up.
4,Great Company,This purchase was a long time dream to have a Panini Press. Using the second time the handle broke on me? Was very upset and mad contacted the company within a short time replaced the Panini Press. I have used several times really enjoy and works great. If had taken a long time to correct would not have ever purchased another product.
3,Works good but-----,"If this grill had a temperature control it would be hard to beat!It really gets too hot,you have to stand over it or you'll have a burnt sandwhich.Also it's hard to beleive that a company as big as Hamilton Beach could'nt have included a $3.00 grill cleaning, grooved scraper like most of the brands have."
4,Awesome For The Money,Very good for the money. Only drawback to it is there is no temperature control so thicker sandwiches are some times not as hot as I would like in the middle. I would still pick this over a $150 dollar model.
1,bad buy,"Panini maker broke down within 3 days that I bought it. Very, very disappointed in this product. Tried to make grilled cheese sandwiches and the cheese barely melted and the bread got hard when put in a little too long. Would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
5,Nice vintage item!,"Everything was exactly as described, except the condition which turned out to be even BETTER than described. Exceptional transaction."
1,Balance Bar melt down,All of the balance bars I ordered were melted and tasted bad! This is not the first time this has happened when ordering from this seller! I assure you it will be the last. I ate some of the the bars and had an upset stomach later! I have never had a problem when purchasing these same balance bars at local stores. I also find the policy of this seller to NOT ALLOW THE RETURN of melted balance bars highly suspect. Were they shipped already in poor condition? Why don't they use a refrigerated truck when shipping food that requires it? I'll stick to the local stores thank you!JL
3,ugh,"I didn't love it. it's a little too big and it wasn't that cute on. probably better for a guy. Oh well, that's what i get for ordering a hat offline"
5,"Fits perfectly, very comfortable & great price","I'm very happy with my new hat. I've had it for a couple weeks now and it fits great, looks great and doesn't have any stupid logos on it like most baseball caps do. I would definitely recommend this hat to anyone looking for a simple, comfortable hat."
1,Not for the Optio W10,"At first glance, you will think that this skin will fit the optio w10 since the camera look very very simliar and its an optio waterproof camera.Couldnt be farther from the truth. I put this on my Optio W10 (new model released) and it although it slides over well, the button placement is basicaly off...and in some locations such as the shutter button, way off. To top it off, the new W10 has 2.5"" screen vs the 2.0"" screen of the WP and the WPi so the skin covers part of the LCD screen. Like another user said, the skin is hard to see through and will have to remember which button is what as well. Pentax should put in bold...DOES NOT FIT THE W10 PROPERLY in their add for this product.Now the concept behind it is fantastic. THe skin does seem like it adds an extra dimension of protection to an already rugged camera. All and All, if you have the W10, I wouldnt really recommend this product."
1,Not a good fit,"I returned this product. This skin does not fit the camera well at all. You have to blindly use the controls, including the shutter and on/off buttons, because they are under the skin and there are no cut outs or visibility of the buttons. The controls on the back of the camera are covered as well. The skin doesn't even math up with the viewing screen on the back. Nice idea, but doesn't fit and it is not at all functional."
2,Not too great,"Yes, it covers your camera and somewhat increases the protection. However, the buttons dont line up with the areas on the rubber casing where they are designed to. This makes it very cumbersome to use the camera with the rubber case on. You will find after a while, that you simply prefer to use the camera without the additional protection.Not worth the purchase."
1,Not Even Close,"This thing is a joke. Twenty-five dollars for a lump of malformed silicone. It may have been designed to cover some camera, but it was definitely not designed to cover the Optio. The screen window is too small, off center and doesn't line up with the display. The top edge, which is supposed to have ""push through"" buttons for the power switch and the shutter control lines up with neither button. You can not turn the camera on or off with the cover in place. The milky translucent color of the thing makes it impossible to see the symbols on any of the buttons underneath. You have to peel back the skin, memorize the button sequence you want, and then after replacing the skin, hope each button responds to your input. Inasmuch as the camera is waterproof to begin with, you are better off just accepting any scuffs and scratches which may occur while it is in your pocket."
2,Cam Skin review,"Not so great - even though it protects the cam a bit, once slipped onto the cam the operation buttons in the back won't work. For some strange reason trying to push the buttons through the skin does not work - in order to use any buttons, the cover has to be removed from the cam."
1,What the...?,What I received was grease-stained and torn and then stapled back into it's packaging. It was a different color than the picture. I promptly returned it.
4,makes the camera look really cool,"and until you get to know the controls, it is awkward finding which button to push but I have not had any trouble with sticking buttons. I bought it for case protection and anti slip when I set it down. It performs both functions admirably.If you want to protect the LCD put a skin on that... but I would worry about trapped moisture. Lens is already behind glass cover.I do always double check the lock on the battery/memory cover before going in the water."
4,MVP 23,"this is the secone one i have used, The firt one lasted 15 months. I loved the protection, non-skid, and grip. The only draw back is you have to pull it off to charge/ remove sd card.MVP23"
2,skin for pentax w camera,"this is only useful if you are worried about the battery cover coming off while taking underwater photos. I bought one and rarely put it on my camera because it makes the buttons hard to press when it is on. It is very cheap so i cant say i am extremely disapointed, but they could have made it a little better."
5,Dreamman,Here goes the first male recording ofAnd I'm telling you I'm not going?from Dreamgirls.C/mon Condon-- If you are looking for Eppie in movie you found theright person. You need guts.Also Sunday from Sondheim's musical of Sunday in the==========gets a massive production with a chorus.Other tracks are his own songs and other current Broadwaycomposers.This is a rare album when Billy can hold one's attention forthe whole recording.
5,Ten stars and a box of chocolate!,"Man oh man! From his (non-musical) spoken participation on the Oprah show it made me curious enough to look him up on the Internet and order an album.He is over the top!!This is the kind of music God puts on to listen to on a Saturday night!I feel priviledged to even have this album in my collection.(When are you coming to Europe, billy?)"
4,See my review of Billy Porter's Untitled CD,"Billy Porter is a remarkable talent. He has an extensive range, and has the inate capability of making classic songs, his own. I first became acquainted with his work after hearing his version of Love Is On The Way, from the First Wives Club soundtrack...when you hear his voice it makes you want to say things like, ""...he should be on Broadway!"" Well, he has been, and he has an extensive body of work. Check him out, you'll love him."
1,Matthew J. Bruckley: An Evil Thief,"Matthew J. Bruckley was a genius on the works and life of F. Scott Fitzgerald, but was also a liar, cheat and thief. He stole this idea from a professor at NC State."
4,Good book,This book gives a historical view of evidence on Druids. It is a good book to expand your knowledge on ancient places contributed to Druidry.
3,Not small enough for undamaged trim removal.,"I bought this pry bar to use for window trim removal. This is not the tool for the job, unfortunately. The ends of the tool are too obtuse and easily damage the trim, even when using metal putty knifes as a buffer. The metal used to make the tool is also too soft. There is quite a bit of spring tension built up when prying with this tool that isn't present when using a pry bar made of higher quality/ more rigid steel. This is a satisfactory tool for prying in confined spaces, where material damage is o.k.."
2,Now as good as I expected from Deepak.,I have read and listened to Deepak's works for over ten years. I was disappointed in the delivery. His teachings on Quantum Healing from long ago are much more substantial.
4,A wonderfully great read,Mr. Kun has done it again. Funny and touching.But does someone want to tell Publishers Weekly that this is his third book?
1,"For the ""special"" reader","This story is about Hamilton Ashe, borderline retarded, and his daily struggles. For example (p103),""One day I'm at work, and 'One O'Clock Jump' is playing onthe radio. It's a Benny goodman song. I'm repairing thewaistband on a pair of slacks for a man named Grimaldi.It'snot as easy as it might seem. First, you have to pin thewaistband, then turn it up and press it. Then you have tograde the seam to elimainate the bulk. After you've donethat, you have to fold the waistband inside out and trim thecorners. Then you turn it right side out again, clip it andtuck the seam allowance, then fold the clipped corner underat an angle. When you 're done with that, you have to pin theedge in place and stitch in the ditch of the waistline seam.It's not easy work...""Ashe doesn't grow, doesn't learn from experience, doesn't get any smarter. It's a dismal, boring, uninteresting tale, unless perhaps you too are ""special""."
5,Perfect Beach Read,"In a light, sweet and airy follow-up to the Locklear Letters, Michael Kun is at his comic best. Showing more depth than in his previous work, he manages to tell a somewhat disturbing tale in a funny, off-beat and compelling way. The protagonist, Ham Ashe, is an aimless everyman, who seems not to appreciate the things he has, although for no apparent reason. That is, until you find out why at the end of the book. In the meantime, there are several chuckles and enough lol's to keep the story moving. You can finish this book in one or two sittings, or just before the SPF 15 wears off. Really enjoyed this effort and can't wait to get his next book."
5,If you could only recommend one book....,"to a Siberian pet owner, this one is it! It covers basic care that all pet owners need to be aware of. I especially appreciate how Mrs. Kanzler conveys on what to expect in the Siberian's temperment. This book should be given to every new Siberian Husky puppy owner, and anyone considering this breed should read it! The price is definitely affordable. The author is a top breeder world-wide, and she certainly knows her subject."
4,A great guide from one of the World's Top Siberian Breeders,"Kathleen has hit the nail on the head with her new owner's guide to Siberian Huskies. An extremely well written book for the beginning owner to the seasoned veteran. I especially love her pictures and her views on Siberian history. The dog sledding pictures are my favorites as they depict the Siberian in their wintry habitat as a true working animal. This book is a must for every library for anyone who loves, owns or is owned by these breath-taking creatures. I've even had mine autographed! And if I know Kathleen the way I think I do, this won't be the last book either.Congratulations Kathleen on a job well done! I can't wait for the next one."
4,Extraordinarily well researched and gripping biography,"Martin's research in long-forgotten archives, in the United States, Great Britain, the Bahamas, and elsewhere, is extraordinary, and the tale that he tells of a young American socialite who falls in love with the Prince of Wales is gripping. He recounts the drama of the abdication crisis with detail and care. However, the post-abdication lives of the Duke and Duchess just were not especially interesting, so despite Martin's best efforts, the narrative does slow down and flags a bit.But as an account of pre-World War II England, told from the perspective of a participant in one of its most fascinating episodes, this book is highly readable."
4,Duke & Duchess of Windsor,I really enjoyed this book. It gave me insight to the life that these two people lived and their disappointment of being snubbed by the royals for most of their lives. It was a really good read.
5,Brilliant,"I had a party on the 22nd of December. As soon as I played this cd, everyone came to see who it was. Some know Peggy's sound, some don't. Babyboomers like me appreciate the trip back memory line when television had tons of variety shows and holiday themes starting the first of December. The sound is clean and sweet. If you love Peggy.....buy it."
2,Ho hum,"I buy a new holiday CD each year. After reading the reviews for this one, I thought it would be fabulous. I was disappointed. Unless you have a previous emotional tie Peggy Lee in general and the songs on this CD in particular, don't bother. This one is like flat champagne."
3,Christmas With Peggy Lee,The sound isn't the greatest and songs are kind of slow. I love Peggy Lee but this is just okay.
3,Christmas with Peggy,If your a Peggy Lee fan and like Christmas music this album is the only one I am aware of.
2,Don't bother with this one!,"As a tool to aide in ""de-militarizing"" your résumé, pass this one right on by. It's a poorly disguised generic how to write a résumé book that offers a few good suggestions in general, but nothing specific to the military. Nothing is addressed about the unique mind-set and terminology that is so predominant in the military, nor does it address the need to translate military terminology and phraseology into non-military friendly wording.If you're looking for information on how to transition your résumé into something head-hunters and potential employees would be interested in, keep looking. There are other books that actually understand what it is to be in the military as well as what civilian employers are looking for. I just wish I'd saved my money on this one."
2,Item not as described,I gave this product a low rating because I was shipped a different product other than what was described. This brush stand shows a position to hold a razor handle in addition to the shave brush.The item I received only held the brush. The seller was very accommodating in providing me a full refund.
2,Bad Video quality...,Bad video quality and equally bad battery life...Battery started having problems in less than a week. Video quality is very poor..Not recommended for a purchase.
2,No Camera capabilities,"I purchased this camcorder after reading further details on the Samsung website. The site eluded to the camcorder's ability to capture stills, but this is not the case. This is probably not a bad camcorder, I could not tell you since I was so upset about being misled that I returned immediately."
4,Nice Bag,"Well designed pockets & options in all the right places. The only problem: the size is just a bit too big, meant more for giants than normal people"
5,backpack,I bought this backpack for my son for school and he Loves it. The shipping was fast too. Will definitely do business with this company again
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I was going away to school and needed a new bag. When I got it it just wasn't what I expected. There is nothing wrong with it except it was too big. I'm 5'7"" and felt if i would have filled it up with books I would have tip over. Like a said there was nothing wrong with the bag itself it just wasn't a good fit for me."
4,True to description - would order again,"Bought this bag for work to replace a worn out bag. Needed it to be roomy which it is. The only negatives (small ones) are 1)that it doesn't sit on the floor well without falling over. 2) could have used another compartment on the back side (which my old bag had which I used for file folder or other thinner items). Overall, description was accurate and the order, shipping and delivery were excellent. Product is a nice roomy size and attractive. Haven't had it long enough to know how durable it will be. So far happy with it."
4,Very good messenger bag - needs more small pockets,"Overall I like the bag...the only minor ""nit"" I have is that I wish it had more small pockets to hold pens, business cards, etc."
4,High Sierra Messenger Bag,"The bag has plenty of room in the main compartment as well the the front flap. The front pouches are on the smaller side, but efficient for my use."
4,Good but bigger than it looks,"Got this bag for my sister. She had picked it out but when it came in, it was quite a bit bigger than expected."
4,Very nice bag for a low price.,"This is a nice bag. The price is quite reasonable too. The shoulder strap is a bit of a pain as it is attached, so you need to untwist it at times. The one end, where the adjustment is, has a plastic ring, which seems to get twisted a bit. Another issue is that it does not seem to be as waterproof as one might like. During a heavy rain it seems that moisture got in (I was not using an umbrella).With all that said, it is quite a few pockets, it is easy to open and close and there is quite a bit of room in it. I am quite happy with it, even with the above comments."
2,Messenger Bag,"I like the bag, but! There are some issues if you are using this to lug around books and a small lap top for school.- the buckles on the sides of the bag roll around, which causes the strap to twist.- I found that due to the flimsines of the bag that trying to get into compartments quicly during my college classes is a struggle.- It's a nice bag, but if your going to put it through the grind of everyday use, it's not what I want. A nice canvas messenger bag is something I will look for."
4,Pretty and sturdy,"My daughter (11 years old) loves this bag. It has lots of pockets- so little things don't get lost. It has outlasted the ""Hunger Games"" messenger bag that she HAD to have for school (that lasted 1 month, and then ripped at the corners), this has been getting heavy-duty treatment lugging books back and forth to and from school and is still in great shape."
4,A bit bigger than expected,"This is a nice bag - two big internal pockets (one zippered) and pockets for my cables, portable hard drive, iPod and pens. Seems well constructed. I'd like it even better if it had a few extra accessory pockets, or even an iPad sleve."
2,"looks nice, but poorly made","Bought it to carry files to work and it fell apart within a month of starting. Waste of money, not recommended."
5,Very large bag!,"This is a nice looking bag with a lot of room. It fits comfortable on your shoulder. If you are looking for a bag with lots, and I mean lots of room, this is your bag!!"
2,So disappointed,"I purchased this bag because I need something that could hold my work items and my school books. I didn't want to have to keep carrying two bags on the days that I had school. The bag was definitely big enough to hold two notebooks, two school books, my personal items, and a laptop. The thing that I am totally disappointed about is that this when this bag is completely full, it doesn't hang right on your shoulders and tends to put a lot of strain on your back. It is hard to carry, and I have to keep adjusting it just to keep it in a comfortable position. It is nothing like I thought it would be and am totally disappointed with the purchase. Now I have to go back to the drawing board and find a new bag for school."
4,Bigger than I expected,I have several backpacks for various situations. I prefer messenger bags when using public transportation as it allows my to quickly & easily slide the bag to my lap when getting into a seat in a crowed bus or train. The bag itself was a little bigger than I was expecting. The build quality is pretty good and has as decent amount of pockets for organizing. The two complaints that made me knock off a star are the shoulder strap pad & side release buckles. The pad is all but useless when the bag is weighed down. The female half of the buckle is attached directly to the main flap so I have to use my finger tips to release. I have small weak hands and they are even more useless when I've got winter gloves on.
2,Good at first now just crap,"Honestly I bought this bag when I was starting out my Senior year in high school. It was an awesome bag for then because I had enough space to really put in anything that I wanted and then some.Then comes college. I have been using this bag for the past TWO days of college and honestly my shoulders have never hurt worse. The shoulder strap when you walk twists itself up into a tight rope and the pad thats supposed to help effectively stops working whatsoever. Also, I only carried two books (psychology and intermediate algebra), two binders, 4 notebooks, and a couple pens/pencils......This is absolutely a good bag for those who don't need to carry alot with them at all times...I was almost forced to tears last night while carrying the bag so happy I bought a new one and with everything in it that I said above the bag that i now have feels lighter and truly easier to carry"
4,Great travel bag,"Great for business trips, has enough space and compartments to fit all my needs. It can hold a lot more than it looks, and is quite durable."
2,Be prepared for UK import duty to be payable on top.,"The bag's OK for a laptop. It's big enough for a 17"" but not expandable to take much else. The strap's OK for short carries but not particularly comfortable for any longer hikes. I wanted it for a camera and lenses - for that it's totally unsuitable it's just not wide enough. I had to pay 13 UK import duty on top to take delivery so beware."
5,great value,I bought this to replace a free bag I got at a conference. Although the old bag had a nice image of the Golden Gate Bridge (and I held out to it too long and spent money repairing it) this is a much better bag and holds more stuff without being too bulky when its not filled.
3,Horrible Service,"I ordered the high sierra tank messenger bag hoping to get a great quality product. I open up the cheap bag its sent in and i see a book bag of all things a two strap book bag not even a messenger book bag. I'm very disappointed. One might wonder if they see what they package.Edit: I originally gave it 1 star but am changing it to 3 stars. Their customer service was great and I got the original product I ordered. The Middle Strap Cushion slides everywhere and is very uncomfortable. This bag holds a lot of stuff (my laptop, 3 textbooks) and some food."
2,I found it boring,"I'm a big fan of the movie Braveheart, and of history, but I could never get into this book. It's written somewhere in between a novel and a work of history. Because it strattles this line it brings out the best of neither world.The author clearly attempted to write a biography on Wallace based on Blind Harry's poems, but he filled in many details to poems that are probably embellished history. I just found the book rather dull."
3,could do better,A great read but contains some obviously false claims about Wallace's birthplace. For a novelised and more readable life story try Nigel Tranter's The Wallace or for a more useful and accurate look at Wallace and Scotland try On The Trail of William Wallace by David R. Ross
1,Don't waste your time,Given - the author did a lot of research about Willaim Wallace - but he doesn't have to explain every step of research he did for the book. I want to read about the story - not go through the difficulties of writting the book. It is a 288 page book that could have been written in 150 pages. When you get through the torrtorous paragraphs of his extensive research - this is actually a pretty good book. It gives a good description of William Wallace. But if you want to read the story of Wallace - try another author. This one does great research - but a bad job on writting it.
3,Missed Opportunities,"The story of William Wallace is based on a very few sources of widely varying credibility. When one is faced with such a situation, there are two courses of action possible. Ronald Williams facing an even greater dearth in his excellent LORD OF THE ISLES compensated by filling in the background so that the resulting read was a much richer experience. Unfortunately, MacKay seemed to spend over half the time dealing with inconsistencies of his sources. This makes for great scholarly debates -- but I think it should be relegated to the footnotes.When I read a book about so exciting a figure as William Wallace, I do not want to know where Blind Harry went wrong and a competing source was a tad better. I want to know why the peerage of Scotland was so fickle, why Edward I had such a thing about crushing the Scots and Wallace in particular, and why -- after Falkirk -- Edward was so ineffectual in conquering Scotland."
4,"good, but tough read, perfect for history buffs","The legend of William Wallace facinates me, and this book offered an in depth insight into his life. James MacKay really did a good job of researching this subject. It is a tough read, but full of facts to keep you interested. Reminds me of the ""Similarian"" by tolken, numerous names to keep track of, but far better.Worth Reading, if your are into History.P.S. I read this one for fun, not coursework"
1,Save your Money!!,"The book itself is not bad, information is good, somewhat dated in parts, but good. The problem is, nothing new is in the book. All of the information can be found at one of several websites like quicken.com, or bankrate.com, etc. Most of the information is pretty common sense. If you have to get the book or don't want to look on the internet for the information, then at least go to the library and check it out and save your money."
5,Before you get in trouble - read this book,This book is excellent! It tells you the ins and outs of how credit cards work and how to use them to your advantage. It explains how to use them wisely and dispells many of the myths that so many people still believe about credit. It gives you in very simple terms the ability to compare different credit offers. The easy to use tables in the back of the book help you figure out if an offer will help or hurt you in the long run and how long it will take to pay off accounts. I also took the advice of getting a credit report. So much on there from the past that didn't need to be there that wasn't helping my rating.
3,OK,"My friend ordered this same gun from shorty usa and it shoots really accurate and far. So, I ordered this gun and it was a bust. It is pretty good for close combat but thats it."
3,I wouldn't get it...,"My friend got this gun and although it may look kool it is only good if your REALLY close to someone. I went airsofting with him today and i used it and we lost bad, it also takes forever to reload. you can slam fire though. if you are looking for a shotgun check out the stinger it hurts bad, I got shot a couple times by it and it's only 10$ more and it comes with a pistol+hotster. but whatever idiot said this is accurate needs to see some good airsoft guns shoot because this one's curveing is awful!"
4,Good economy clamp,"Bessey still makes the best clamps after all these years, no doubt about that. This does not measure up to my plethora of other, professional-grade, clamps in one manner--the threading on the handscrew is rather broad, which gives you a little less control over the pressure applied and adjustability. Also the pro-grade clamps don't utilize the clutch bars, which will invariably fail after a few years of hard use. That being said, I found it was a good value for the money and shipped promptly in time for a specific project."
4,Entertaining,It's fun to watch people's greed interact with their personal stories in this ongoing auction drama. You never know what's gonna be in that locker.
5,I am a little addicted to this lol,"I am not so much that compitition that I like, its the interesting stuff the find that make me want to watch. It catches my interest. Barry seems to find the most interesting items."
4,Nice show,I really like this show. It is very interesting to see what they find. I would recomend it to anyone.
4,review,I really like this program and think it is awesome that Amazon gets these shows that I can go back and see the pilots and start at the beginning that I never got to see.
4,"good, but not pawn stars or american pickers","good, but not pawn stars or american pickersfour different dudes. they're ok and all, but i doesn't really grab you or have the humor like the other shows.interesting storage units they have out in CA. i might gamble on a few myself"
1,But where are the original owners and their stories?,"Yes, it's fun to go treasure hunting in abandoned storage units. But it's good to keep in mind this stuff did not just pop up from nowhere. Behind the scenes are other people's losses. According to California law, 'abandoned' means just three months of unpaid rent. Why would anyone abandon a unit full of property - coin collections, restaurant equipment - unless due to some personal tragedy, death, prison, illness? I would have more respect for this show if they occasionally went and interviewed the people who were forced to give up these units, and learned why. That would be more of a true ""reality"" program and not just a vulture program."
3,It has ups and downs for all walks of life.,"While the concept is great, this show has too many con's vs pro results, sure it will make money for the scripted bidders and their counter parts,from what they drive I say they do much better then 90% of the crowd holding babies and attempting to get a chance to bid with so much network cash flowing around the auctioneer. sure it will make money for the network, sure it will see 1000's of dvd box sets and so forth getting sold. Who loses? the people who have been doing this work for decades making a living and keeping it simple, now they have 20 million auction fever newbie's running around default auctions bidding deliberatively high prices on a sub par economy in effect, breaking the bank for many who depend on this type of trash/treasure hunting to feed the family..Hopefully it comes and goes fast and people lose interest, rather not be working the beat for a welfare check cause of some show and corporate greed without recourse."
4,A great Sig Airsoft product!,I had high expectations for this gun when I saw it first and those expectations were met. It is a great gun but breaks easily if dropped from about waist level onto hard concrete. Although the price may seem high I would recommend this to any Airsoft enthusiast who likes Airsoft guns based of of real weaponry.
5,awesome service,"Great product, and timely service, I used it for a plaque for a soldier that was getting out of the military. The pistol realistic look made it look awesome"
2,Not for serious players,"Really is about 200 fps tops, plus after having it for 1 year of moderate use, it broke. The slide doesn't operate properly and the trigger gets caught. And, it doesn't shoot at all. So for $25? No way Jose`. Maybe $5."
1,I don't know why-,"I purchased this item for my son and husband's sensative skin. Since we use cetaphil lotion and cream, i choose this for daily sunscreen moisturizer but it failed. It stings my husband face and make acne on my baby's face. I'm very disappointed."
1,Do not buy,...this is way too complicated and does not need to be. The writing is too dense and honestly not entirely acurate.
5,Neat Little Machine for the Price!,"This is great for home use! If you try to do too many documents at once, the shredder will idle for 30 minutes to cool off. I think that is wonderful. I don't have to worry about burning up the motor. It takes care of itself.It shreds the way it claims. You can't read or put back the shreds to read personal information (banking slips, S.S. #'s, etc...It does exactly as described, it's not loud and doesn't take up a lot of space. You can do 4 sheets at a time, but I just do one. It's fast.Worth the money for basic home use. Don't buy this if you have a lot to do on a regular basis (because it will idle if you overuse it)."
3,Good Value,"Considering the price it Works ok, and as advertised, 4 sheets max. It is a little annoying that if you dont feed the sheets perfectly, which is almost impossible, they hit the corners and dont get shredded right. Basically the shredder blades, dont extend as far as the opening, ridiculous, so you gotta be carefull because the opening is barely bigger than a letter paper. An extra blade on each side of the opening, I believe would cure the problem and get it 5 stars."
1,"Great Software, if you are MAC user","I have been using this product for a long time.. years ago this was one of the most affordable and feature rich graphics software for windows. The problem I have always had with this software is that it was designed for the Mac, and the windows version seems like an after thought.. features that work great on the mac, just don't translate well into the windows world.. and the programmers and software designers at this company didn't really take the time or the effort to make them work on the windows version.. I would avoid this if you are buying the windows version"
1,Mac users are also suffering,"I disagree with the previous reviewers who seem to believe that this is a great program for the Macintosh that doesn't translate well to the PC. Its a horrible piece of software on both platforms. Many years ago, Canvas 3.5 for the Mac was one of the best drawing programs available at the time. Unfortunately, Canvas X is buggy, unstable, and much more difficult to use than earlier Macintosh versions. Most of the user interface does not seem vary Mac like at all and appears to have been directly ported from Windows 95. It frequently crashes (often when trying to save a file). It also hangs frequently, especially when trying to export complex graphics to other file formats, and one must use the OS X ""force quit"" feature. I've also had problems with graphics becoming corrupted when pasting them in from other programs. As others have mentioned the customer support is useless and no bug fixes have been released in a long time."
1,worthless,I bought this software to work on AutoCAD files: the software was not able to properly open one single drawing! It quits either upon opening or when performing basic tasks as zooming. When contacted the technical support from ACD was only able to aknowledge the fact but could not bring in any solutions.My advise: do NOT buy it: you are wasting your money!
2,CANVAS 9,"It is not too disappointing that ACD decided not to support Mac users by discontinuing with Canvas for Macintosh for their Canvas 11 version. After all, previous Canvas versions (7,8,9 and 10) are prone to problems including frequently crashing and slow printing. Canvas 3.5 was a wonderful product and not only did they (ACD) not improve on that, they raised the price dramatically. That was the first sign of trouble and sure was the first move to lose customer support. Their decision to finally forget about Mac users due to economic issues is something they created and deserve."
1,Don't Bother,"Very disappointing compared to other videos available. Scratchy, poorly recorded. Nice skating moves but the lighting and the camera do not do justice. Not worth the money."
3,OK MOVIE,Full Frame Panned & Scanned.Very Average Quality.Not worth what Amazon is asking.The Film . Typical Exploitation Bruce Le .
5,A Few Words From the Author,"Imagine my surprise at finding my book listed on Amazon! While the book is out-of-print, I believe photo-copy versions are still making the rounds (with my permission as long as the copy includes the copyright page). From the original photocopy versions in the late 1980s through the 1991 publication of this book to 1996 when I retired, this was the de facto standard for training those involved with Stop Loss Insurance. Are there any new pretenders to the throne interested readers should look for?"
1,Poorly written rehash of the basics,"This book is very basic, hastily written and offers absolutely no advanced trading tips whatsoever. Read Tony Oz' ""Stock Trading Wizards"" for a solid advanced day trading book. Our traders at Daytrading University, trainingaloha.com, benefit from good books, but I do not recommend this title as it offers nothing that could benefit anyone but the greenest of traders. 'Daytrading Into the Millenium' by Turner is also good, as are the Schwager's 'Market Wizards' books. If you buy this, you'll return it like I did. Flipped through it in 30 minutes and said 'so what's new?'. Can't blame these guys for trying to cash in on the daytrading phenomenon, I just wish they'd produce a meaningful or insightful book. This one's a dud."
1,This book is better than Pure Gold!,"For the authors that is. There is nothing in this book that you will not find in the book Electronic Day Trading Made Easy by Misha Sarkovich, which is about half the price of this book. Misha's book covers all that is in this book and a lot more. Do not buy this book."
1,Advertisement for a bootcamp,Any book written with the intention of selling a $3000 boot camp to its readers doesn't have the readers best interest in mind.
2,Another Disappointing OTA Release,"Everything that comes out of this place seems to be overpriced beginner material. There is nothing advanced at all about this book, I felt like I was being talked down to, as there was no ""meat"".Funny, the occasional positive reviews for this book sound like they were all written by the authors themselves, using different names. This book is not advanced, has nothing at all about market maker plays.Everything the OTA puts out should be labeled ""Warning-Rookies Only Need Read this - Give us Your Money"". I spent $3000 on their boot camp, boy what a ripoff.I should have bought more books from Amazon on trading and saved my money. There are some other good trading books out there, this is not one of them. Try books by Cooper, Turner, Murphy, Abell; they're all solid. This one's a loser."
1,Returned My Copy--Third rate!,Worst day trading book on the market and I know i read them all!Very little substance. Sub-standard information in every category.Patel's book is much better.
4,day trading is the business of the millineium,THE BOOK IS AN GOLDMINE FOR AN DAY TRADER.IT CLEARS THE MISTAKES AND IMPROVES TRADING DRAMATICALLY.
1,Donate your money and get a write-off!!!,"Instead of buying this book, go to Las vegas and select ""red"" or ""black"" and you'll have more success than trading these vague approaches. Better still donate to a charity and get a write-off. I can't imagine you trading profitably with these general approaches."
5,Excellent book - Excellent invesment!!,"I have read other day trading books but none has captured my interest as much as this one. Strategies for the Online Day Trader gives clear and visual examples of what day trading is like. Furthermore, this book also shares excellent day trading strategies. This book is definitely a good buy and a good investment for your investments."
5,GIMME A FOLLOW-UP!,"This is one of those books that I could not put down. Little fluff, no non-sense and a whole lot of beef. Well balanced between psychology and technicals. I see their perspective more and more everyday. I read a little bit, trade the next day, and go back to it in the evening and aha!...money! I want a follow-up!!"
3,"KJV is based on TR, not MT","In response to a prior comment, the King James Version is not based on the Majority Text. Actually the King James Version is based on the Textus Receptus."
5,Majority Text and Textus Receptus,"There seems to be a bit of a question about what these different texts are. I asked someone far more knowledgeable than I, and here's what I found.Textus Receptus, from which the KJV was translated, IS Majority Text. Or rather, is one of the Majority Texts. Majority Text merely describes a family of texts, that are all (apparently) similar. I believe that Majority Text is also known as Byzantine Text. The more modern translations (NIV, etc) are taken from the Alexandrine (I think) family of texts."
5,Best Customer Service Ever !!!,Super Fast Shipping. Contact customer service. They anwser all my need. This is the Best Customer Service Out There Guys. Thanks for product ( CROWN-XTI1000 . Keep up the good work. Will shop again.
3,Price is right,"The phones are about what I expected. I enjoy the speaker phone; the multiple ringtones and ringtones I can assign to friends. The message notification light for my voice mail is very helpful. The intercom feature to communicate with the second phone was an unexpected bonus. No more yelling for my wife from the basement. The phone offers all around basic features with perks that are difficult to find on today's phones.The phone itself is just ok. It sounds like the person I am talking to is talking into a can. When I talk, I feel as if the other person was disconnected. The voice enhancer does help with this. The ring volume is either very loud, or not loud enough. There needs to be another level. We have missed several calls because we didn't hear the phone when it was on level 3 of 4.Overall I am happy with the phone. The price was right and the extra features the phone does have are just enough for me."
4,Great portable phone system,"We purchased the Panosonic KX-TG6022B 5.8 GHz cordless phone unit in August, 2007 and it has performed beautifully. The sound quality is excellent and it was extremely easy to program and set up. We are very happy with this product and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a digital, cordless phone system."
1,Terrible sound quality,"I ordered this phone based on the positive reviews it recieved, but the sound quality is truly terrible. It sounds like I am in a cave - everything has an echo and everything is very indistinct. The problem may be that I have a wireless router, but this phone had even worse sound quality than my previous phone which was only 2.4 GHz. Since this one is a 5.8 GHz, it should have been an improvement. Anyway, I returned this phone and bought the uniden DECT 6.0 phone, which has much MUCH better sound quality."
1,I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone.,This phone has no interference with wireless internet. But besides that I think it stinks. Even if you don't have a message there is a bright light on the handset even when it is on the hook. That sucks to try to sleep with. The Caller ID is the worst design I could think of. You can't look at it when you are making a call like if you have to look up a number half way through dialing. No dice. Not bad to just talk on but as far as extra features it's terrible.
4,Phone Evaluation,I find this product very nicely meets our requirement for cordless communication. It has a number of features that are simple to impliment should you choose to do so. We are very please with the performance.
5,Great value,"I'm very impressed with this phone. I was prepared to pay up to $90 for an expandable phone like this. When I saw this one for $50, I snatched it up fully expecting a subpar product despite the impressive feature set. I chose the version without the answering machine because I have voicemail through my phone service.This phone is great. Even though the voicemail is through my phone service, the phone will tell me when I have messages. I was impressed by that. Batteries are NiMH, so they're better than the NiCd batteries of the past. CallerID works great. The phone gets an excellent range and it sounds good. I'm very happy."
5,Best cordless yet,"This is the best cordless phone I have yet to buy (and over the years, I have bought many of them).Handy, compact size, good lighting of screen, easy transfer of names and numbers from one handset to the other, clear voice (esp with the enhancer option), easy navigation with center button, no static whatsoever. Nothing really to complain about.If I had any recommendations for change, they would be for backlighted numbers on the handset and colored keys for talk and end (namely, green and red) to distinguish them easily from the two soft buttons at top. I found myself sometimes in dim lighting conditions pressing the wrong buttons to talk or end."
2,Caller ID does not display phone number!,"This phone has good reception and the design is fine. But the Caller ID does not display incoming phone numbers which is very annoying! What is the point of having Caller ID if all it says is ""Incoming Call""? Yeah, no kidding."
5,Great Phone,I like this phone set. They do everything they are supposed to do very well. No complaints. Great reception. People I talk to say I sound like I'm in the room with them. No static no matter where I move in the house. More features than we use. Easy to learn to operate. I especially appreciate the speaker phone function. I would buy them again if I needed another set.
4,great phone,"I really like this phone. it can expand beyond 2 hand sets and the handsets that come with it are really light weight. I haven't had any problems with it but i got a replacement plan just in case, only because the previous phone i bought, of another brand, the batteries died on me after 5 months. i would recommend to anybody looking for an affordable phone and a great phone, to buy this one."
4,Great Phone,I've owned this production for about a month now. It's very easy to use. Good reception and sound quality.
4,Great Purchase,"Being it's a Panasonic, I had no second thoughts about its purchase. The phone is great and my favorite feature is the light up ID. The ringers on my phones are always off and the light gives off just enough glow to catch your attention, I also am pleased with the alarm function on the phone. Four stars only because the handsets are very small and although I have long skinny fingers, the keys are somewhat hard to push. Aside from these two things and the handsets not having a lightup key pad, its a very good buy. Good looking phone with lots of neat features!"
3,Lack of belt clip makes phone a nuisance,"These are great phones, but I was stunned when I realized that they do not have belt clips on the handset. They have headset jacks, so Panisonic is well aware that people will be using headsets with the phones, but they didn't consider what you do with the handset when you are walking around with your headset on. It's really a pain, because the purpose of a headset is to talk hands-free and having to carry the phone in one hand really defeats that purpose. This small issue is enough to make me avoid using this phone in favour of my other set. It's concerning that Panasonic would cheap out on something this small."
1,Major Problem,"Even with freshly charged batteries, all of the handsets drop my calls without warning after about 30 minutes of conversation. Sometimes, the person I am talking to will tell me I am ""breaking up"" shortly before the call gets dropped. This problem occurs regularly, regarless of whether I am sitting immediately next to the base or not. I have been unable to resolve this problem on the phone with Panasonic service, so now I have to send them all in for repair. A major bummer!"
2,"Good sound quality, but a couple things drive me nuts","Overall, the sound quality is good, so I have no complaints about that. There are two things about this phone that drive me absolutely nuts. First is the phonebook feature. It is a bit of a hassle to enter numbers and names into the phone book of the phone. Once the names & numbers are in one phone, I have not found a way to get them to automatically sync with the other phone. So, it is a bit of a game of ""find the phone that has the phonebook"" when I want to dial using the phonebook feature. Second is that the product didn't come with a belt clip. I purchased two headsets so that I could go hands-free and do chores around the house while on the phone. Without a belt clip, I may as well forget using headsets (separate purchase)."
2,what happened to Panasonic?,"I purchased these phones to replace my old V-tech phones. I've trusted the name Panasonic for quality. These phones are not up to the Panasonic standard I grew up with.The sound quality is not as good as it should be, voices sound ""tinny"". The battery doesn't hold a charge. After a 5 minute conversation, it has to recharge. The phone feels shabby, no weight to it.I should've stuck with V-tech. Live and learn."
2,"Good Phone, Bad Battery Performance","These are nice phones with good features and are easy to set up and use. They are, however, sadly lacking in battery performance. When fully charged, one can nearly deplete the battery after a 45 minute phone call.If you talk a often on your home phone, don't buy this phone.If these phones held a charge as well as the older Panasonic phones, I would have given them 5 stars."
1,Not what I'd expect from Panasonic,"This phone was a huge disappointment. I used it for one week and returned it to Amazon. Its overall functionality was acceptable. However, the keys aren't arranged intuitively, the key pad isn't lit (come on...that's crazy), and the headphone jack was shorted out on both handsets. When I put my headset in, I heard tons of static when the cord would move a little bit.This is a pretty pricey phone, too, especially as compared to Uniden models that are much better."
5,Goood quality phone,Very good quality phone. what is missing is:1. Does not announce the caller2. Base has no speakerphone
3,expandable phones,Didnt like the phones once they were delivered. Everytime I am on the phone it just goes blank for a few seconds and the person I am talking to can't hear me.I wish they worked better...
4,Panasonic Cordless Phone Review,"We have always been very happy with the Panasonic cordless phones. These are very good as well and very easy to use. The only issue I have found is that I can hear anyone speaking on them when I am on my business LAN line in the house but I believe this is a problem with the phone company.Other than this, everything seems fine so far!"
5,Excellent cordless phone with no wire mess,Excellent phone. Tons of features that I have not even learned yet. Good display and good display light. The second unit does not need you to run a wire and create a clutter. That is the best part of the phone. Just one phone cord at the main unit. Then just plug in the second unit and you are set. Everything works perfect. No complains.
1,CARAVANS,"I was very excited to purchase this item, THE CARAVANS GOING HOME Cd. For I am a CARAVAN fan, I have every song already on the item rather it be on cassette and or cd, or album. The only reason that I purchased the item was that it's states that the last 3 to 4 songs are LIVE! I only came to find out that it was false advertisement, those songs are not LIVE!!!!! They where are all recorded in the studio. I real big disapointment, so I gave the Cd away. I wish that from now on AMAZON would check and make sure that the items that there selling from the distributors are all accurate."
2,Too much of a 'Users Manual',"This book was of little help. Although I am a Gay Witch, I got just as much about Wicca in this book as I did from other books that were not Gay oriented. This is to say that the book offered me nothing new. No new insights. No enlightenment or knowledge that I did not already have.Maybe I do not know what I am looking for, but this certainly was not it.Blessed Be."
3,A sweet read,"Not the most dramatic time travel ever ~ especially since the time gap was rather short and the time traveler, Charlie, had a less severe case of ""fish-out-of-water"" syndrome than most ~ but a great story. The whole bit about both romantic leads being able to get millions of dollars out of the villain (the lyin' cheatin' ex-husband, of course!) was a sort of a stretch, but forgiveable. We always like it when the story ends with the right people together AND rich, right?Any-hoo, go ahead and give this one a try. It's good reading."
2,It was OK.,"The book was alright, but don't rush out to buy it. This was my first book by Constance O'Day-Flannery, and it will probably be my last. I love time-travel romances. But this just fell short of what I like. The beginning was priceless and I couldn't stop laughing as Charlie found himself in a strange place with a woman in labor. But then as the story went on and I kept waiting for the romance to grow I was disappointed. It was an OK romance, but if you want good time-travel romance...""A Knight In Shining Armor"" is the best!!!"
1,Time travel element rather weak,"As a time travel romance - this book fell FAR short. As a person who has just traveled 76 years forward in time, Charles Garrity was able to adapt to the present time at a rather incredibly fast pace. After Suzanne accepted who this person was and where he came from, there was not much ""time travel"" interest in this book at all. You could also tell where the storyline was headed the first time Charles entered Suzanne's house. I felt this was quite a lame book. I've read other books by Constance O'Day-Flannery and this one (hopefully) is just an aberration on her part. I hope the next book she writes is much better than this."
2,Not Miss O'Day -Flannery's Best,"Dear Readers,if you are a devotee of Time Travel Romances, youmay wish to just get this from the Library.The fact that it wasn't until page 289 that Susan finally usedbottles for her baby, instead of staying exhausted and having herbaby literally hooked to her chest,was a real bore.If she was truly aware of the ""baby books"" she had read, a breastpump would have been extrodinarily helpful. So,Miss O'Day-Flannery why keep the character acting stupid?...perhaps thewriter needs to read the earliest of her delicious novels andreturn to the Genre with a block buster,rested and in full form."
3,Drags on,"Interesting topic, great beginning, but in the middle it just begins to drag on a bit. I had a very hard time keeping track of so many names and dates.Ok, it was interesting to read about the various myths surrounding the wall, and Lovell paints a nice picture of China not as a single entity throughout history, but as a jumble of ethnic groups where the distinction between barbarian and civilization is blurred. Wait, actually, this conflicts with one of her themes, that there is some uniquely Chinese ""obsession"" with wall building...A confused book. Interesting history, mixed with misunderstanding, unsupported opinions, and at times bizarre almost neo-colonialist commentary. Trying to justify the opium war? Really? And what does that have to do with the great wall?If it's a rainy day, read the first 100 pages."
2,Lovell against China,"I rate low the way Julia Lovell write this book: Its seems a revenge against 'China'. You can tell facts, and you can tell facts with anger. I'm a reader of Chinese History. All what Julia Lovell said you can find in History Books, but... the personal taste must be put aside, I think. It's seems a campaign, a crusade against ""those who they think they are!!!"" Sorry my English is not good enough in order to explain myself in a better way."
3,At times a struggle,The Great Wall is a history of the 'Great Wall' of China and all of its stages of growth. It book begins with some of the misconceptions regarding the wall and its history and origins. It was interesting to read how the first sections of the wall were built. The pattern of Chinese thinking regarding the wall and the protection it did (or didn't) provide.I did think the book dragged in the middle. The book got very repetitive in the middle regarding the various Chinese rulers and ow they continued to believe and expand the northern wall. I am not a scholar on Chinese history and found it a little difficult to foolw along with the many rulers and their names.The book is good and the story ends with the rise of Communist China and how they deal with the real wall of northen China as well as the virtual wall protecting China from the ever growing internet threats.
3,Opinion on 'Nun in the Closet',"This is a pleasant read, but slightly disappointing, in that it almost seems as if it was a fledgling writer's first book. Maybe it is,as Ms. Gilman has certainly written more convincing books. The main characters are endearing, but unreal. However, if there are any more, using them, I would be happy to read them. The idea is good and makes one want to turn the pages, but one doesn't feel that the writer has any actual knowledge of the lives of her characters."
3,"Rather cute, but check that copyright first","I ordered this book because I'm an Anne Perry fan, but I don't see Ms. Perry's name listed *anywhere* on or in it. I didn't buy the premise for a moment because none of the nuns this Catholic-from-infancy reader has known were even remotely this naive. The young, leftover hippies had me scratching my head until I looked and saw that this book came out in 1975. The author has a MESSAGE to convey and is none too subtle about conveying it. What saves the story from being a preachy bore is the author's sense of humor. I liked it, but not well enough to keep, so I gave it to my mother. Ann E. Nichols"
2,only Gilman novel I have given away,"The hippies, thugs, herbs and drugs were just too 1960s for me.I have reread the Pollifax books many times and love all but her last one. I have also found Kaleidoscope is just as delightful as the Pollifax stories. Am very sorry to hear that one reviewer was turned off to Mrs Gilman by this book but I can understand why. I would have been too if I started with this one."
5,Outstanding book on the POW/MIA Issue,"This 1993 book covers the POW/MIA issue from World War II through the Paris Peace Accords to the corruption in the 1991-1992 Senate Select POW/MIA committee. Sauter and Sanders expose the fraudulent POW/MIA ""official"" positions taken by the U.S. government.The number of documented examples along with critical analysis puts this book way ahead of those books supported by the U.S. government. If you want to see solid documentation on the biggest scandal of the century then this book is a must read.Rich DalyResearcher and Member of the Board of Directors of the Minnesota League of POW/MIA Families and Minnesota Won't Forget POW/MIA"
4,fantastic songs,I bought this product for a Christmas gift.My friend was thrilled over the CD because it had good ole'favorite songs. I would recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys Southern Gospel Music.
4,A great intro to country,"How often have you heard someone say how much they hate country, except for Johnny Cash or ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""Here's a compilation that person should enjoy.Featuring old tracks from Cash, Elvis, Hank Williams, Ricky Skaggs, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, and more, this cd breathes of the authenticity of yesterday.As a compilation, not every track is outstanding, however I enjoyed most of them, skipping only a few. The standout track is ""Farther Along"" by Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, and Dolly Parton."
4,Nice CD,this is a nice Cd of old Gospel songs my mother-inlaw loves it and listens to it everyday good it also has a verity of singers
1,Not worth listening to,This is a poor excuse for a gospel album besides being a bad recording. I can find no redeming features about this dvd.
2,Almost nothing about her designs,"Potential purchasers of this book should be aware that it has very little about Ms. Herrera's designs. I had hoped it would contain photos of her fashion designs, but the book is mainly a puff piece with glowing comments about Ms. Herrera from her family and friends. There are some interesting photos from her early years, conveying a sense of her evolving style, but overall the book is disappointing. Definitely not an objective review of her career as a designer."
5,"FABULOUS DESIGNER, MAGNIFICIENT WOMAN","Ms. Herrera is a delight to read about, a delight to see in photographs, and a delight to have in the fashion world.A wonderful, gracious designer, well loved and appreciated throughout the fashion industry."
4,A Must-Read for 11-12 year old American Girls,"Jean Fritz does a remarkable job engaging the reader in the compelling tale of one woman's life... a woman who is often overshadowed in the popular culture.Today's young girls will benefit in learning how much women of the past were much like they were AND had much fewer benefits AND how much they worked, created and moved their way towards their desired end result which we all benefit from today.Fritz' tone is amusing and highly readible while covering the important facts at hand as well.I am looking forward to having my daughter read this book so she can get to ""know"" Elizabeth Cady Stanton."
3,"You Want Women to Vote, Lizzie Stanton?",I selected this book to read for a Children's Literature course that I was taking. I found the book to be a good blend of history with humor. I found it quite enjoyable to read. I thought this is a great way to teach children about history.
5,A great resource for Disciple Bible Study,"Anyone involved in the Disciple Bible Study courses will find this Bible tracks very well with the lessons. I found that the majority of assigned readings were identical to the phrasings of this Bible. The comments provide a wonderful foundation for in-class discussion. Class facilitators would be well served with this Bible.As for those critical of the ""liberal"" commentary, I would offer that this Bible incorporates recent theological, social and archeological insights. The new (1999) informaiton has been scrutinized by leading scholars and approved for Christian consumption. You will find many of the same experts who were interviewed in Lee Strobel's ""The Case for Christ"" listed as contributors. I see these facts as a continuing affirmation of the Truth. You will find yourself better tooled to discuss your Christian world views with those who seek the comfort and guidance not available through secularism."
2,Good but flawed.,"The only real quibble I have is that the text used is the NRSV. This politically correct emendation of a great text, the RSV, does violence to the original imagery. Accuracy was given second place to being trendy and emasculated. This version is not useful for anyone concerned with accuracy."
2,Warps Badly on a Glass Top Stove,"We purchased this griddle thinking that it was a no-brainer since it came from Circulon. We were wrong. When we used it on our glass top stove it warped very badly in the center, to the point it became so unbalanced that we were chasing it around the stove top when trying to flip our pancakes. We did get a good laugh out of it, but it's a shame to have to return it. Thought this would be a winner. Instead, it's a loser."
1,NOT induction cookware,"Beware, this griddle is NOT induction cookware as it came up on induction cookware search. I had to return it, such a shame, looked like it would have been nice."
2,Are you gullible enough for this video,"This basically is an advertisement for his ""microfiber reduction therapy"".This video should be free or at least only the cost of shipping and handling! There are 4 basic stetches in the video. I think his insight on the biomechanics of the swing and how they relate to flexibility are good, but don't waste your cash on this video."
1,Golf flexibility,Way overpriced. Too little content. Could have been done in 6-10 pictures with some corresponding narrative. Very slow moving with lots of dead time.
2,"Straight Out Of The 70's, Early Cable After Dark!","Kinda lame. I had forgotten how silly her movies really were, but classics none-the-less."
4,Funny movie,"About 12 years ago, I was a university student. I saw this movie in the cinema. It was just limited version based on the press censorship. I thought this was a funny movie, some plots were ridiguculous. However, you can relax yourself. Don't think anything, just feel the interest."
2,young lady chaterly 2,The movie was disappointing the first one had a better story this is often the case with squeals.
2,Too noisy,"We had to return this unit - it was just too noisy during the night for us. Once the water starts to drain from the tanks, the two tanks start to rattle against each other."
4,pretty good humidifier,"Had this thru one winter. Good features in being wheeled, easy to refill, and quiet when i finally figured out how to stop fan vibrations with little felt furniture stick-on pads under fan housing and on tank sides. The filter being free standing and one piece is very esy to flip when refilling tanks. Beautiful to look at but a bit awkward to rest on a level in the sink while refilling because of the curved handle face of the tanks. Does a great job humidifying a small 2 bedroom apartment but wish it didn't make such frequent short off-on cycles."
4,Does its Job Well - Be Careful When Refilling,"I bought one of these a little over a year ago and recently bought a second to replace the first, not because it was defective, but because the water bin split.I recommend this product, but offer a word of caution: be careful when refilling the 2 water bins. One slipped from my hands, landed on the floor and split. I discovered that it cost almost as much to replace the one water bin (price plus shipping) as it would to replace the entire unit it was somewhere over 50% of the price anyway. I would have had to pay that and still had a unit no longer under warranty. Anyway, I wouldn't have bought the 2nd unit had I not thought it was a good humidifer and a good value (too bad the parts are so expensive)."
4,Excellent humidifier,"A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for with humidifiers. The controls are very accurate and reliable (confirmed with a separate humidistat), and a good deal of water is vaporized in a short time. Compared to the usual $30 drug store models, this is vastly superior. My only complaint is that the two water reservoirs must be placed back on the machine very carefully after filling to be sure that the mechanism opens the valves to release the water into the well as required."
2,Some problems with this model,I upgraded from another Honeywell model to this one due to the increased tank capacity. Well it turns out that this has 2 seperate tanks and when the one becomes empty the other is to take over. The problem is this does not happen and you need to wiggle the tanks to get the second tank draining. A quick internet search showed other users who reported the same problem.
1,Broken and terrible return policy,"I was excited to receive the Honeywell HCM-6012i Quietcare 11-Gallon humidifier, but once I set it up it did not work properly. The auto humidity control would shut off and not come back on until I manually made the humidifier turn back on, and the medium fan setting did not work at all. Also, the low fan setting was very loud and I suspected WAS the medium fan setting, which meant that there was no functioning low setting.Returning this item has been the real disappointment, so I caution anyone who purchases this item through eAccess. You will lose out on shipping TWICE. They only refund the cost of the item, not the shipping you pay to get the item in the first place or the shipping you pay to return the item. I am out over $45 due to shipping for an item that was broken upon arrival. Buyer beware."
5,Works great!,"I have had this for a week now and love it. The comment about not being able to roll it is ridiculous. You just push it on the opposite side of the tanks and you can easily move it from room to room. I researched for hours to make sure I bought a good one. I even went to Sears and looked at the one that the other reviewer mentioned. This one is $20 cheaper plus you don't have to pay another $10 in taxes.It is kinda annoying having to fill the reservoirs twice a day but that is necessary for all humidifiers. From what I can tell, the digital reader is dead on.You can adjust the settings to make it work for a certain number of hours, to a certain humidity, and a constant on setting of low, medium, high.I highly recommend for the $110 price."
2,Would Not Buy Another,"The first unit we received chirped like a cricket. We returned it without hassle and received another unit as a replacement. One tank empties just fine. After the first one empties, the unit shuts off and the other tank has to be played with before it will begin emptying.The comments on the design of the tanks are spot on as well. Refilling the tanks is an awkward task but is not as bad as some make it out to be. I need another humidifier for a second level of the house but will not buy another of these. We will just live with the failures of the unit as it does seem to put moisture in the air...when it's on."
2,Quite Loud,"As good as this may humidify, the noise at night in our bedroom can become unbearable. It is not the motor itself that is the culprit; it is the frequency vibration - one plastic part against another. Unfortunately this can happen at any combination of fan level and the level of the tanks being full. The only possible solution that we have found thus far is to wedge Q-Tips between the parts at several points. But even this only works sometimes and one can still be woken up out of a deep sleep by a sudden jump in noise level."
4,Effective but not so quiet,"This humidifier does work very well in the sense it does what is advertised but it is not as whisper quiet as some of the other reviews lead on. I definitely would not recommend it in a small room. We have it one corner in a large master bedroom and it produces a white noise that you eventually do get used to. Also, it does make an occasional gurgling noise as the water pressure equalizes as it drains down. I don't think you can avoid this with any humidifier with this basic design. I've used it for one month now and not had any issues with mold in the filter or housing. I am using the Protech ball that comes with the unit."
1,Honeywell Humidifier doesn't work,"It didn't work at all, the motor would not come on. It appeared to be missing a switch, so I sent it back. It was just a waste of time."
1,Sucks,Only one of the two water bays work most of the time. You have to adjust it to get it to be in quiet mode.
2,amazingly bad,"We received our first unit and everything was fine, until... After less than 1 month, one of the water tanks broke when we were filling it (it's really poorly designed, the tank is large and unwieldy and is impossible to stand on its own while filling, plus the handle is difficult to grasp). Also, the filter became moldy within 1 month of use.We ordered a replacement, and after receiving it, the unit didn't work.So the main reasons for NOT buying this humidifier are:- Poor design- Cheap construction- Difficult to fill- Difficult to maintain- Need for frequent replacement of filter and cleaning cartridge"
1,Became moldy in 2 weeks of normal use,"This machine is basicly a tube shaped sponge filled with water that air is pulled through. It did a really good job of humidifying my home, but after 2 weeks it began to smell musty. I opened it up and and the sponge was moldy. This is a horrible design and can't be healthy for you. I returned it and bought a Hunter with a ""permawick"" filter. It doesn't put out as much moisture as this one did, but it doesn't mold and it doesn't put out any white dust like the ultrasonic ones do."
2,poor design,"The honeywell hcm-6012i looks great until you attemp to fill it with water.The shape of the tanks requires more hands then a human posses to unscrew the lid, turn on the water, balance it while filling and screwing the lid back on now that it is full of water.This process is a two person job in a tub or a very deep sink.this just goes to show you once again beauty isn't every thing."
1,Flimsy and poorly built,"Several days ago I received my first Honeywell HCM-6012i. It arrived with one of the plastic water tanks broken and had to be returned. Amazon immediately sent me out a replacement unit. It arrived today. The box looked pretty beat up but the unit itself shows no apparent physical damage. However it does not work. The filter has been soaked,tanks have been filled with water, the unit is on, the lights are illuminated, but I cannot feel any cool air coming from the unit. The humidity level is set, the filter has been soaked and the fan is set to high, but there is absolutely no sound or cool air coming from the machine at all. This one will have to be returned also and two defective units is too much for me. This time I will ask for a refund and not a replacement....and buy a different brand."
3,Will I ever get the rest of this product???,"Ordered this item well over a month ago. the right water tank was cracked. Called the company (you talk to a company called KAZ, not Honeywell). They send you another one in 7-10 days (seems kinda long to me). They sent me a left tank (in 7-10 days), not a right one. Called back, they sent out ANOTHER left tank (in 7-10 days). Called back, the sent out ANOTHER left tank! I now have 4 left tanks, and no right one. This time, the man says he will send the right one, but I can use it anyway with just one tank. would have been nice if someone told me that earlier.anyway, no offer to expedite shipping, not much of an apology. When they mail the tanks, the mailing materials are so cheap that the new tank could easily be damaged. OH, and they don't even want the wrong tanks back...so strange.keep your fingers crossed for me.The unit is pretty cool, I'm sure it will be better and less noisy when both water tanks are on it."
1,Poor quality control,"I was excited to get this after all the positive reviews. When I received my first humidifier I was pretty excited and satisified with its performance. The digital hygrostat was a nice feature even though it lead to constant on/off cycling and I was impressed by how much water it could hold. Problems started after about 2 weeks, the unit started making a loud irritating whinny noise even when set on the lowest setting. As result I requested for an exchange from amazon, who promptly over-nighted a new one. Surprise, the new unit wouldn't come on period. To add insult to injury, the filter in the old unit got moldy only after 2 weeks of use and started spewing moldy air. This tells me that the mineral Pro Tek ball is not very effective. After back to back lemons, I'm looking for an alternative."
2,Listen to the bad reviews!,"If The Replacement filters were free for life I would recommend buying this but they’re NOT free. You can waste your money on new filters if you have a disposable income. Just spend 30 bucks every two weeks and every thing will be just fine. A company like Honeywell should have done some more product testing before rolling this out to consumers. I hope that Honeywell receives customer feedback like this to help them come up with a solution to this issue and improve this design flaw. Oh and by the way, don't even try to clean the filter or remove the scale it will just fall apart."
2,Quiet but Duh,"A wick absorbs water that is in a fraction of water around it in the base. Also in the base is a little well that holds the shutoff float.Like -> ---| |--- The wick will not absorb the little well water.If all the water is gone in the base, there will still be water in this little well that pushes the float up and down.As a result, the float always floats, and will not shut off the fan if all the water is gone in the base wasting electricity and not helping the wick. I guess Honeywell cut back on real engineers."
4,"Good set of spoons, not perfect","This is one of the most complete sets of measuring spoons that you can buy today. I chose these because they covered almost all the sizes I care about, especially the 2tsp and 1/2 tbs. The pinch measurement is somewhat useless (who measures a pinch?), and I wish the 2/3 tsp measurement was a 3/4 tsp instead (what recipe calls for 2/3 tsp, unless you're dividing it?). I like the red plastic ends; they add a little color, and I don't like really shiny measuring spoons (when you measure something like oil into them, it's harder to see the level you've reached). I think they'll be plenty durable. They do balance upright as advertised, though just---the slightest bump will send them over. Overall, pretty good."
3,Wouldn't have bought if I'd seen them in a store,"These spoons are cheap and flimsy. The metal is poorly finished and very irritating to the touch. I picked them because I trusted the brand name and I wanted lots of sizes. I'll keep them because I hate making returns, although when I find something nice these are going to Goodwill."
3,"Interesting family, satisfactory writing","The story of Reichmann family and how they built a real estate empire only to lose much of it is an intriguing story, however not a 200 page book. I feel like this book added irrelevant information in order to reach a length that would be acceptable to readers of the genre and that the writing style was inconsistent at times.For fans of the time period I strongly recommend Going For Broke as an alternative."
3,Not as thorough as I would have liked,"I would have liked more discussion of each pottery group especially Van Briggle. It really didn't give me the details that I was hoping to get. If yo are looking for an overview, this is a good book to have."
2,HPDeskjet 5650 Printer,"I have used HP Inkjet printers for over 12 years, I am on my 4th or 5th one, I had no problems with any of them, I just moved up to newer models. I have been very happy with them & have recommended them to several of my relatives and friends who were either just getting into computing or were unhappy with another brand. When I moved to a new HP computer with Windows XP I decided to move to another printer again & decided on the HP Model 5650 advertised at something like 21ppm black & white & 16 ppm color.Well it is the slowest printer I have ever used, it takes about a minute & a half to print the most simple b&w pages & ""forever"" to print color. I don't know if it is XP,or some printer problem but it's driving me crazy"
3,So Far So Good,I had an older model and it seened much sturdier.It is a good small office printer for one person.can't do envelopes on top of paper which I could do on the previous printer. Other than that it is fine.
4,Fast Shipping -- Good product,"Ordered this on Wednesday night. Had it installed by Friday at noon. 10 minute install. It's hard to find a personal printer to work well with NT. This one does, for a good price."
5,parallel port printer,"I was looking for a parallel port printer and could not find one. I finally checked in with Amazon and found exactly the printer I was looking for. Thank you, Thank you!"
5,HP 5650 Printer,I am extremely happy with the HP 5650 printer I purchased and it does an excellent job on pictures and print. I am also very impressed with the service and speed provided by the seller in getting the printer to me.
2,HP 5650,"Ordered the printer as the specs and the reviews seemed fine. First of all the printer was larger and heavier than expected. The real issues started when I wanted to install the software which I still have not managed to - plug and play... The customer service for Mac is at its best to be rated with 2 stars... Hope I'll get it to work, otherwise I'll return it."
3,"Printer OK, but HP Support Non-Existent","It's not a bad printer, but it is vastly overpriced. And- oh, by the way, HP no longer supports it by updating drivers, so it's essentially obsolete out of the box. Buy something else."
5,Superb upgrade...,"In December 2001 I bought a Lexmark P51, because of the price. The ink took hours to dry, and smeared on several different brands of paper. It broke after a year.In March 2004 I bought the HP 5650, and it is a much better performer than the Lexmark it replaced. Installation was easy, though the setup program took a while to install the drivers (strange, as it was running on a brand new HP Pavilion).I have printed several different things, including a flight ticket and two photos, on standard printing paper. The 5650 prints quietly, the ink dries quickly and most importantly the quality of the prints is superb. My parents were shocked that I printed a photo with such great quality, on an inkjet printer. They thought I bought a color laser!Although the installation was a bit tedious, the print quality is great. Taking into account the low price makes my purchase all the better. I highly recommend the HP 5650."
2,Not a good printer for students,"I am a college student, and I haven't had a good experience with this printer. I had a Lexmark for about a year, which was fast, but low quality and unreliable. When the cartridge ran out on that, I bought the HP 5650 instead. I've had it for about a month, and although setup was easy and the quality is very high, this is NOT A GOOD PRINTER FOR STUDENTS! Even on fast draft printing quality, it takes at least a minute to print a full page of text. The quality of the printing is very good, but it is EXTREMELY slow, even compared to most cheaper printers. The claim of 21 ppm is laughable. I think you'd need about 30 of these to get 21 pages in a minute."
4,Printer,In good condition and seller was great at communicating about problems. The cord needed to be replaced so there was delay in shipping order - the seller to replace cord. Sent two toners due to the wait. Very pleased.
1,POS,What a complete piece of junk!!! I'd spend my money on a Canon i560 if I were you AVOID this printer at all costs!!!
1,terrible printer,"Lots of problems installing (Windows 2000 Pro) - eventually paid for an in-home service call. Technician managed to get it to work, but could not get it (HP software) from trying to reload each and every time the computer started.Noisy - clangs and bangs. Slow. Eats lots of ink. Poor quality photos - lines visible, bad color.Finally gave up, and have bought a Canon. Love it! Staying away from HP now (have tried other products in past, very disappointed with every one)."
2,Installation,"What would be a four star printer is reduced to two stars by awful driver support. Installing on Windows XP is a terrible experience. It asks you to plug in your printer, then it freezes and doesn't detect it. When it does detect it, it says ""New Printer Detected, Please Wait"" and then freezes. I'm no computer novice, and I've never had drivers give me a problem like this.The drivers off the CD or their website give the same problem. It is very frustrating. HP did an awful job."
5,Excellent printer!!!,"Simply put, this is one excellent printer and I'm glad I bought one. I don't understand some of the complaints I've read in this review section--one in particular saying something about a quality issue. I couldn't disagree more--It looks and performs like a ""well-oiled machine."" I finally gave away my old HP (which also served me very well) and have been using this 5650 for about six months now. No problems whatsoever. I have it hooked up to a six-year-old laptop and do mostly black and white printing in ""best"" mode. I am continually impressed with the quality. The color printing is equally impressive to me even without the photo cartridge. Also, the black ink cartridges are comparatively inexpensive--I believe at about (...), and last a good long time. No complaints at all here."
5,Mr Hacker,I have been reading this book over and over to my kids. It has never been boring to listen to it again and again. That is what children do. Lovely story....
5,A must-have for any ostomate,"This book was given to me by a friend when I was in the hospital awaiting ostomy surgery. I must've read it 1,000 times...it became a reference guide and a best friend--the only friend I had who'd been through this surgery. Her writing is clear and comes from her own personal experience. It has practical advice on ostomy management as well as advice on getting through the emotional roller-coaster of ostomy surgery. An excellent book for anyone going through, or even considering, ostomy surgery."
5,Great Book,I am a sudden caretaker for my 90 yr old father's new colostomy. This book provided a lot of basic information and covered areas that we would experience after he left the hospital. It has given me the reassurance I needed to provide him with good care.
3,The Ostomy Book,It has alot of information for anyone who is having a life style change due to medical needs. It is a little to detailed for a beginner but would be good for Dr's to share for info.
2,Good introduction,This book is a good introduction to the topic but fails to address specific church/state interactions. It draws heavily from Matthews' 'Western Aristocracies' but that is a much better work for the scholar.
2,Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.,"While St. Constantine the Great is commonly credited with Christianizing the Roman Empire, the status of official state religion was not given to Orthodox Christianity until the reign of St. Theodosius. Nowadays, when American rulers commonly take as their main tasks the maximization of the GDP and the proliferation of feticide, the example of a ruler whose first concerns were the ""first things"" could be an elevating one. Unfortunately, this book examines the emperor-saint rather from the perspective of a modern member of the Labour Party, and its history is un-traditional. This book is not a good starting place for studies of this emperor, who bequeathed a major legacy to the world. The Orthodox still remember him on his feast day each year, and one should examine a different title to learn why."
4,Good book about the last successful emperor of Rome,A good history book that educates the ready about the late stage of the Roman Empire. It certainly provides enough information for a history student to lead them to more in depth studies.
1,DOA,"DOA - dead on arrival. Powers up, display is ok. Appears to transmit, nothing on the other radio. Channel and security code set."
5,A Much Needed Study,An excellent book dispelling myths associated with healing in Pentecostal circles.Thomas surveys the New Testament to understand where different authors understood the origin of illness to be and what our pastoral response should be.
3,Listening,"Listening is a good book, especially since there are so few out there on the subject. It is quite out-dated, and is hard to keep the information sorted in an outline form. It was purchased as a required reading for a college level class. As the semester goes on, hopefully the knowledge within this book will become permenant."
5,Delivered exactly as promised.,"The book was in great condition, just as advertised. It arrived very quickly. I am very satisfied with this transaction."
3,Chilling,"My first note is that the editorial reviews attached to this book by Amazon seem to apply to a different illustrated volume of Hansel and Gretel, not the one illustrated by Monique Felix.I ran across this on a search for the perfect edition of Hansel and Gretel. The illustrator does an excellent job, but her illustrations are far too frightening for young children. At times, Hansel and Gretel's eyes seem to glow, and the witch is horrifying... her long tangled hair has bones in it. You can almost hear shrieks and groans as you look at the pictures. I showed the picture to a friend of mine (a graphic artist), and she found it very disturbing.I cannot give the book fewer than three stars, because it is so well done. But I cannot give it more than three, because I think it would scare the daylights out of young children. Granted, Hansel and Gretel is a scary story, but I remember coming across less frightening versions when I was a kid."
5,Childhood book,"I loved this book ever since the first time I read it in 6th Grade. Now, I read it every Christmas. Wonderful, heart warming story."
3,"This book is not much exciting, but truly sad.","I bought this book at Scholastic not long ago for 4 bucks and after I read through the whole book, I did not feel any excitement whatsoever, the only thing I actually really appreciated is the sadness, especially at the end her dad said I love you to Darcy after all these.Again, this book is certainly not the best, however the author did a great job of depicting the character and the emotion captures."
5,""" It was a very touching heartfelt book that I enjoyed.""",Darcy Deeton has suffered a terrible tradgedy. Her older brother David has died while chasing after Darcy. He was struck by a car and pronounced dead.The story goes on about how Darcy searches for her brothers heart to lift the guilt off her chest and apologize.
5,A Beautiful and Touching Story...,"It's about a girl and an older brother (David), who both seems to be like close friends than a brother or sister. The girl seems to also admire him and likes the attention David gives her...until another girl came into the picture and it's like a love triangle situation. Darcy (David's sister) didn't like sharing the attention with the girlfriend of David's that something happened: David died after him and Darcy got into an argument. Now everything change for Darcy and she felt guilty about what happened that she thinks that the heart of David's (which someone has from a heart transplant) will show that David is still alive somehow. So, Darcy set out a journey that she (and the reader) won't ever forget and Darcy realize things that she never did realize before.I read this story 2 times now and it touch my heart. It probably will touch your heart too..."
5,"It made me cry, and I don't cry easily","This is by far my favorite book. I cried at the end, and I don't cry easily. It's believable, and the writer did a great job of showing how Darcy felt left out, hurt, and guilty. It's easy to understand why she wanted to find her brother's heart, and how it would help her. I especially liked how the book ended."
5,This book is wonderful and beautifuly written.,"""Searching For David's Heart"" was unbelievable. I didn't cry during the movie Titanic, yet I cried both times I read this book. More than once I wanted to scream at Darcy, ""Just tell them!!!"" This was without a doubt the best book I have read."
5,greatest book!!!,"Oh my gosh. This is one of the most hearfelt books I have eer read in my life ( and I've read a lot.) The book just makes you cry with tears of happiness and sadness. You know its a great book if your reading it and at every scene you can picture it happening. Well when you read this book you will. I read it about a year ago and I can still remember everything about it, THATS how great it is. So if you're looking for a great read read this its for all ages."
5,This book is good!,"This book was different than any other book I have read. When Darcy's brother David is killed in a car accident, she feels it is her fault. She runsaway with her best friend, searching for the person who recieved David's heart that he donated. This book also talks about racism, and everything comes together in the end."
3,Promotes Incorrect Safety Procedures,"The story is nice. However, on page 11 you will find the following text, ""At seven o'clock the watch became a warning. Ike's mother opened all the windows in the house.""In the 50's and 60's this was a recommended procedure because they incorrectly believed that the difference in pressure inside and outside of the house would cause the house to explode when hit by a tornado.Please let your children know they should not go near windows or glass doors during a severe storm or approaching tornado. They risk being injured by flying debris entering the house through the glass or being cut if the glass is broken."
4,To long,"Good for hills, but on my 26 in uni it made it hard to turn. Wish there was more info on sizing, it turns out you measure from the center of the square taper to the center of the pedal mount."
5,"Arrived quickly, worked wonderfully","I purchased these new cranks for my unicycle. My father-in-law helped with the installation. Out of the whole experience, I can say the easiest part was putting these on (removing the old cranks was a different, unrelated story)."
1,"RAMBLING, DISORGANIZED, SLOPPY","Read the last ten pages to learn the author's beliefs regarding this case. The rest of the book is mere filler with constant rehashing of ""leads"" and ""clues."" An interesting case, a terrible book."
3,"Good story, bad ending","This book held my attention as I read it practically cover to cover. It is very interesting, albeit annoying at times as the author goes in great detail about numerous leads, only to have them ruled out a few pages later. I can see why the author did that -- to show the exhaustive work done by CID and FBI investigators, and also to give the reader a small, small taste of the incredible frustration these investigators must have felt at the time. The problem with the book is that it is highly anti-climatic. The researcher, Jacobs, did not ""give up"" (as some have implied), he basically solved the mystery it's farthest moral extent. I do recommend reading this book, as it shall hold your attention through and through, but be prepared to be disappointed with the anti-climatic end."
2,"Good story, bad book","...and I wanted it to be good so badly! But, it just was not to be. This is a book about someone who did a lot of research and decided to publish every word of it, rather than just the pertinent information. It becomes irritating to continue to learn information about the subject, only to be told that it is all totally worthless. And, the end is anti-climactic. In the end, a diligent researcher accepts the word of a single source as fact. Doesn't seem like the same man. Perhaps he was just ready to retire. I suggest this would make a pretty good movie, but not a book."
3,Equal to an adhesive bandage strip in protection.,"I bought this product assuming it would seal my cut with a waterproof bacteria proof layer. It easily lost integrity whenever it was wet while washing my hands, which reopened my cut and caused annoyance and constant reapplication. A standard ""Band-Aid"" Adhesive Strip type of bandage would have provided the same layer of water sensitive barrior, but I guess this was more durable when dry and less permeable to bacteria than an adhesive strip. I will use this in the future when water isn't an issue, but when I need to get wet I'll seal cuts with a different Cyanoacrylate glue. Perhaps I will try LiquiVet, Vetbond or Dermabond."
4,pain free indeed!,"We really like this product. While it doesn't provide as thick a layer as New Skin Liquid Bandage, this goes on pain free, which is critical when applying to younger patients."
1,"Heavy, cumbersome and overpriced","It is HEAVY there is little rebound in the strings and the handle is extremely short. So short it is too awkward to use. Throw the ball, toss the ball or short hold a bat but skip this. Hurts me to say it about a U.S.A. made product but it is not worth the money."

3,Difficult to rate,"This novel poses complex problems for the reader, and there fore I find it difficult to give either a straight positive ranking or negative one. If you are interested in understanding the inner workings of the mind of someone who is living in a war-ravaged society, then this book is excellent. But if you are reading it to understand more about Lebanon's bloody history and civil war, you won't find much here...it's really focused on the thought processes of its protagonist, Asmahan, and if you don't bring to the book existing knowledge of the place or the conflict, you won't learn anything. Therefore, I'd really recommend it only to those who know the backdrop of Lebanon's civil war."
1,Confusing and Boring,"I personally thought that Beirut Blues was long, confusing and boring. I didn't have any clue what was going on nor did I have any motivation to finish the book, because I had grown no emotional attatchment to the characters. I couldn't work out what the main character, Asmahan, was actually thinking or understand her relationship with her friends and family. I also didn't know what was going on in the setting throughout the book either which is a shame because I know from research that she lives in an interesting place, yet it was not portrayed clearly enough for the reader to get that impression. I DO NOT recommend this book to anyone because I think it was a waste of time, words and paper."
3,"Slow, repetitive","I picked up this book, with the hope that I would getter a better glimpse of Beirut. As far as halfway through the book, I am still confused, trying to figure out more about the character and her thoughts. The book tries to look inside her thoughts, but it seems that every letter is a different way of explaining what is going on inside her. The story line is somewhat hard to make out, as one would need to read it within the thougths of the character."
5,The Starter Pack: an example of creativity against food shortage,"I have the opportunity to watch this documentary and it is really well produced. This is a non-biased presentation on how creativity and determination shaped a public policy against famine with outstanding results at Malawi, Africa.Reading the facts about the ""starter pack"" policy as I did, does not brings you the opportunity to put faces on the account that a paper brings. Here you will see the story from the side of the farmers, as well from the point of view of academics and government officials. Definitely, a ""must-see"" for those interested in economic development, agricultural extension service initiatives, and community participation.Check it!"
3,Eh,"I actually liked 'Escape to Witch Mountain' better than this remake. This remake is original in some ways (the kids are actually aliens) but overall the pacing and some of the dialogue in this movie are rather lacklusrer. Some will enjoy this movie, others won't, I recommend you try 'Escape to Witch Mountain' Dwayne Johnson does an okay job in this, though it's not his best role."
4,DVD Race to Witch Mountain,"Pretty good - love The Rock and of course the visual effects are good. Definitely oriented to the kids market. Tired sub-plot of the ""bad government man"" - aside from that, fun to watch."
3,The Rock goes to Witch Mountain,"Ok, so I'm one of those action/si-fi nuts. I watch most everything The Rock does. Some of it's good, some of it's not so good. This movie is geared to younger people, so you have to keep that in mind. My son is still a little young for it. It's cool. I probably won't be watching it again anytime soon, but if you haven't seen it just be prepared for a Rock movie aimed at younger people. If I didn't own it, I'd probably still buy it on-sale or second hand or something."
2,Yikes this is bad,"Being a child in the 70's, I really enjoyed the Witch Mountain original movies. So I had mixed feelings on this ""redo"". Like the other reviews point out - the plot is not related to the original movies.Unfortunately, this movie is pretty much a train wreck from the start. The dialogue is really poor, therefore there is no chemistry between the actors. Plus there are some scenes that make no sense what so ever - Cheech Marin as a auto mechanic, Junkyard the dog showing up in random scenes, US Govt's ability to locate 2 kids in Vegas using video cameras.I was hoping for at least some good special effects, but even those seem on the cheap side. Even the spaceship was on the boring/cheap side. I think a new Ford Fusion's dashboard has a more high tech look than the kid's spaceship.I think The Rock is a good actor and kids are were fine, but this script doesnt give them a chance to shine. I know this is a kids movie -- but it could have been sooo much better."
4,Can Hollywood make a movie without an Al Gore moment?,"From the previews, I really looked forward to seeing this and it was great except for the political ""save our planet"" from environmental disaster. The remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and even the ""Golden Compass"" had an appeal to save the North pole for the Snow Bears (like they live on a diet of snow cones ??) Can we have a movie just once without an environment agenda! Still an OK movie."
2,Interesting concept but with very bad actors,This movie would have been very good if they had just recast the two little alien people. In my mind they showed little to no real emotion and they both gave off silly performances in a bland attempt to sound serious. Other than that the movie was interesting. Also it is very weird that there are over 5 different remakes of this film. Can't Disney just stick with the original?
4,Fun Movie,"Didn't care for this movie when I saw it at the theater. After renting it, I liked it a lot and purchased a copy of the movie through Amazon. It really is a fun movie."
4,Better Than Thought,"Short and sweet, this was less corny than I thought it would be. I'm not all too familiar with the original Witch Mountain movies, but from what I can remember, this is much better. I love The Rock. He's not the funniest man or the best actor, but he really grabs on to the personality of the role and makes it his own. I rented this movie for the fear that it wouldn't be good and I wouldn't mind owning this. I do recommend this."
3,"For children or family, not adults or even teenagers","Perhaps I had been too indulged by the masterpieces of Pixar (I know they are animations). If I were not a fan of the Rock, I would certainly have not been able to finish it. The story is so standard. The CG and costume suck. May be good for children to be watched together with parents. Definitely not for adults."
2,Not so good,"I bought this film for my daughter and she bored, is good for a night without plans, but rent it."
1,More PC Crapola,"The usual mindless chase scenes, explosions, and aliens who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from the inside. Still, I was suspending much of the disbelief necessary to finish this film . . . until the PC drivel entered in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, their planet is dying because of years of neglecting the atmosphere, the military on their planet is the bad guy, blah, blah, blah, the Men in Black from the US government are violent and hideously unforgiving, blah, blah, blah. More propaganda from the ""hate your own country"" crowd.Wouldn't let my child watch this."
4,Race to Fun,"A good story if somewhat convoluted, the special effects and character interaction was very good."
4,Entertaining,"Good entertainment for the entire family. Fun, clean, action-packed, aliens, Dawyne Johnson! You can't go wrong for a family movie night with this one!"
4,Movie Worked and Met Expectations,"I just wrapped up the movie and my overall impression was that if you are looking for a kids movie that a parent can watch as well, it meets the grade. It is probably has too much action and fighting for the under 9 crowd, but the story is easy enough for kids to follow and the dialogue is clean. I will add that the there is no blood resulting from the fighting. Overall we were pleased with the movie."

2,Music wrecked movie!,"This movie should have been a four star movie but because of the horrible music, I gave it two stars. Trust me, the music wrecked the movie! Disney, I don't know why you used sub par music for this movie. I almost turned the movie off because of the sub b-flick music. Too loud, and just wrong music. It didn't match the movie. Just imagine sitting and watching Disney's Cinderella, then throw in some Rap music. It just don't fly. Way to go Disney! I'll be selling my copy of this movie for under $5.00"
5,Race to Witch Mountain,I received this days before I expected it to arrive. This was great. My son will be so excited on Christmas.
4,Lots of action,Great movie for kids in the 10-14 year old range. I enjoyed watching my kids reacting to what was coming as much as the movie.
3,Details About This CD,"As an fyi, the bonus cd only has one full track, the first one, ""No Idea's Original"". The other four tracks, 2 through 5, are just snippets of tracks that will be on his next release, ""The Lost Tapes"". Furthermore, on disc 1, the track ""Braveheart Party"", which was on the original release, was removed. I only gave this three stars because I have the original version, and this is a bit expensive for a release that doesn't add much new material. But if you never bought ""Stillmatic"" at all, then this is a good pickup."
3,Broke first time using it...but they replaced the faulty part,The strap clasp broke the first time I used it. I contacted the seller and they got a hold of the company...they sent me a replacement strap...WHICH WAS MADE A LOT BETTER!!! No problems since then!
2,stylish but strap not durable,I got this in red brocade. Looks fab. Lasted 3 weeks before strap broke. Anyone know how to get a replacement strap? I'm extremely annoyed!
2,"Great looks, but really poor quality.","I purchased this bag from Amazon during one of the baby sales a couple months ago. I was so excited to get this because it looked very stylish and just like the $$$ ones from other brands. The bag itself is fairly large and can hold everything you need from bottles to diapers to wipes to snacks and a few baby toys and rattles. But like others previous, after about a week of use, the metal buckle snapped and I didn't have more stuff than normal or anything that was overly heavy. So it gets a couple stars for style, but not for construction and quality."
3,Decent quality cable,"I purchased this box of cable to make custom-length cables for my server rack. The cable itself was pleasant to work with, and gave consistent crimping results. It cuts cleanly, strands are a breeze to separate and straighten, and all told I cranked out 30 cables in under 30 minutes. Considering the fact that I haven't had to make many cables in the past 5 or so years, I was fairly surprised."
3,not the broadway version,I'm doing the musical at a local theatre and wanted to get the true story. quick read of very interesting info. nice to know that the musical takes creative liberties.
2,Mediocre at best,"Hutson's intentions may be good, but the end product leaves a lot to be desired. Despite one reviewer who loves it so much he feels compelled to give it gushing reviews over and over again, this slender volume is short on anything resembling depth. Hutson devotes much of her effort to tracing the history of the Chicken Ranch, but she jumps the proverbial shark when she reaches modern times. Interviews with the actual participants--apart from some paraphrased conversations with anonymous former employees--are sadly lacking, and Hutson's prose is gossipy and prone to rambling editorializing. For pure entertainment value, check out Larry L. King's ""The Whorehouse Papers"" instead."
3,Innocent Obsession,"I think this is my first Harlequin publication that I have read. I wanted to read it because of the setting, and the author is thorough in her descriptions of locales. I wasn't disappointed. It was very nice and a little different from my normal readings. I was a little surprised at how good it was."
1,THe Ring Looked Nice but the Amber looked like plastic,"Generally speaking, the ring was light but that's not a deal breaker because it is being sold for a low price. I loved the ring and fit but I had to return it because the Amber looked fake -plastic like. I returned the ring using delivery tracking and the package was deliverd to silverinsanity. To date, this company has not issued a refund nor have they responded to emails. I emailed to check on the status of my refund and have not heard from them nor have I gotten my money back.Order at your own risk."
3,Good value,"It took only a week to had the ring shipped to Australia, but I must admit that I'm a bit disappointed with the amber stone. It doesn't really look like the one in the picture. It's kind of cloudy. And it's a bit too big (size 8), but I hope to be able to get resized down to a 7.5. It's definitely good value for money though and I'm glad I ordered it!"
2,ring,i love the ring but the sizes arent right i ordered a nine but its to small and I took it to my jewelry store and they said it couldnt be sized so I have to give it to someone else. its a lovely ring but i wasted my money on it. be warned when buying about the size
5,A New Owners Guide to Yorkshire Terriers,I wish this book had been available when I got my first Yorkie! Very well written; she approaches the subject with common sense --plus it is great fun to read. Super book--super breed!
3,Yorkie,"Being a new owner, I wanted a more practical book on the breed.I found the author to be focused on the competitive aspect and""quality"" breeding lines. For someone who was looking at entering dog shows, this would be a useful book. For me, whowas looking for some insight at the pet level, it lacked practical applications."
2,OK,"This book had a bit of interesting information...but like most dog breed books, seems ""canned""...like they change the cover picture, give the same general information about all dogs and sprinkle in a bit of breed specific information."
2,its okay,"I got one of these for my son, he loves it. However, it is impossible to find replacement parts for it. All the online sites give you the run around. Now it doesn't run and my son is bumbed."
5,oo yeaa,"great, great.....great? just buy it, don't ask questions, very talented musicians with great vocals and beats. guitar riffs unbelievable, all around great band talent wise and listening wise."
3,Please enter a title for your review,No progression here. He's just filtering what remnants he has of the creativity and playing techniques demonstrated on the last two Emperor albums through a coating of generic powermetal. Half this album sounds like it could have been written by Dragonforce.
3,A primer for the world of Battletech.,"The world of Battletech is for those people who enjoy sci-fi, Japanese culture, and Anime. Like so many successful series of books, Battletech uses the story line of an ancient culture and makes it new again by transplanting it into the far future. Battletech...3025 is the first step for those that are curious about the Battletech/Robotech etc. phenomenon. It has alot of neat schematic like drawings, and real-sounding history notes. If you like this book, you probably are a candidate to pursue the continuing story of the Clans. If you do not like what it gives of a peak of, then stop before you waste any more money"
1,"good for coloring, bad costume history","The illustrations in this book are redrawn largely from figures and recreated historical costume in the Costume Museum of Japan (Kyoto), which is not noted in the text. Not only does the author commit egregious mistakes in attributing illustrated costumes to specific periods, the dates for periods that accompany the illustrations are not given. Nineteenth century examples hardly represent the tremendous changes is fashion that modernization brought about. Let my nine year-old color the pictures? Yes. Let him think it represents accurate period costume? Not on your life. Dover usually does much better than this."
4,Does the job,"Good product. They shipped it right away. Move in a slow random pattern to prevent streaking. Pressure is split between two nozzles, so for areas needing maximum pressure you will need to use the wand. Saved a lot of time - and most importantly eliminated the isotonic fatigue of using the wand by itself."
2,Not enough content,I have purchased his dvd before and been happy with them. I was disappointed in this one because it had only two paintings. Others I have purchased have 4-6 paintings.
3,CHeaP,"Viz is being cheap. CHEAP. 3 episodes I mean come on! for [money] dollars. Do the math it's [money] per episode! There are over one hundred episodes and it's still going and you expect to get them all like this pLEASE.This includes the english dub and Japanese with subtitles. THe English stinks and the Japanese rules! The english dubbing is horrible. Ok More on the content now, these episodes will not get you satisfied. Cliffhanger at the end of episode 9. might as well get volume 4 with this. I'm warning you! There is brief nudity on episode 8 WARNed"
5,A Great Buy,"In this DVD Sesshoumaru changes himself into a gigantic white dog demon, complete with red eyes & poison saliva. Also we meet Nobunaga, a clumsy dimwit with a monkey on his head. Nobunaga is head over heels in love with a princess, whose husband has been turned into a toad,& who has been taking young girls from villages & sealing them inside frog egg things so he can steal their souls. And then in the last episode Shippou appears (he's so cute)along with the thunder brothers, who killed Shippou's family. What makes things wrose is that the youngest Thunder Brother wears Shippou's father around his waist. Poor Shippou."
5,An amazing piece of work.,"This is THE reference for anyone, professional or amateur, who is writing an episode guide or just wants to have a list of the episodes of a given drama in airdate order. An invaluable resource, as shown by the number of Web-based episode guides that cite one or all of these volumes as references. For most TV series, Gianakos also critiques certain episodes, and puts the shows into the context of their time. The 1959-75 volume is my personal favorite, capturing the era I believe to have been TV's best. This is an inexplicably underrated series of books."
3,simple and honest,"Yes, when a personality rivets one - and haven't we all been there - any close up look into their lives is welcome. Jeannette is thus affected by MFKF - she is hungry to be in Mary Francis' company and I don't doubt for a second that MF understood full well that JF would write this simple story. I don't find dishonesty in the effort."
4,Intense action filled drama.,"This book is an intense and thought-provoking story. It's characters are realistic and entertaining. I am looking forward to and wondering if Duncan stays in the ""game""? I'm ready for a sequel!"
3,Useful supplement,"This is an excellent secondary text for an intermediate student of Arabic. I wouldn't try to teach myself grammar points out of this book, but it is a perfect reference guide for refreshing knowledge of the more subtle points of fusha grammar.Grammar points are explained in English with English terms. The Arabic grammatical terms are in parenthesis following the English. Thus this text will not help you understand 'irab like the Arabs do- for that you'll have to tackle something like the al-Jurumiyya. In lieu of something that hard core, Haywood and Nahmad have created a quick and relatively painless reference guide (far more user friendly, if more modern-focused, than Wright's Grammar)."
2,It's ok for collecting rather than playing,I purchased this item as a X-Mas gift for my 12-year-old nephew who loves to play with star wars toys and he really liked it but he would have loved it if the batteries didn't leaked in the batterie compartment causing it to no longer make sounds. This a nice gift for someone who loves to COLLECT star wars item rather than to play with.
5,One of my favorites,This is one of my favorite CDs that I own. I don't get tired of listening to it like I do other music. Matt is great to see live as well if you get the chance.
4,An artistically-written first-hand account of a natural life,"I found this book by accident after remembering her articles on bee-keeping in The New Yorker some years ago. What is startling about this writer is that she lives her very full life, and yet has managed to perfect the craft of writing to tell us all about that life. She has made me re-think my definition of art. While I have always seen art as communication (some may disagree with this), I have grown to be less impressed with people who are artists first and livers of life second. Sue Hubbell reminds us that you have to have something to communicate first and foremost. It's just wonderful that she has the ability to give us insight into something prosaic as beekeeping (others have written of the country life) and show us the magic that lives within."
4,Natures + Ozarks Enjoyment,"This is a good book, and I agree with the generally positive comments made by the previous reviewers. But I would also like to add that what I actually enjoyed most was the author's keen observations about the Ozark people -- shrewdly funny. I married a Missourian with roots in the Ozarks, and having spent some time there now, I can hear their words, their voices, their sense of humor, and their stories, through Ms. Hubbell's own voice. (In fact, I find it almost hard to believe that I'm not actually listening to my husband's relatives at their social gatherings!)"
4,Just enjoy,"This is solely for the pedantic review by ""Urban Naturalist"". This book is simply a look at a person who is making observations of the world around her. It does not need an over analyses or pretentious display of book learned education. It is a book written by an individual about simple things that make up her life and the feelings she receives from this experience. It is a nice read. You do not have to memorize the scientific name (genus species) of a critter for it to give you a unique memory. I write this as a field biologist working in Alaska who sees daily the awe in recent college grad eyes when they witness nature in person. There is nothing analytical about it, just visceral. This is what Sue writes about. For those interested in nature, I would recommend a search for the book ""The Abstract Wild"". Urban is Urban and this recommendation may give insight to that. Enjoy your reading time."
5,good book,recommended by a friend and i thoroughly enjoyed reading it. couldn't put it down. need more books like this in this day and age.
3,A year of Country Living,"We read this book in my book club. The subject matter, nature, birds, wildlife etc is not something I would pick out myself, but it is beautifully written. The author lives alone in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri. She writes about what she sees around her, mostly about nature, birds, amphibians, mammals and some about her neighbors. She loves her life and surroundings. I would recommend this book to those enthralled with nature and discovery. I really wasn't excited to read it but I am glad I did go out of my comfort zone. I give the book 3 stars."
4,The REAL Secret Life of Bees ... and Beekeepers..,"""A Country Year"" is an absorbing bucolic, understated tale of life as a rural beekeeper in the Ozarks. Sue Hubbell offers naturalist lessons without a whiff of pedantic as a shrewd observer of animal and plant life. Her story of the hard work needed to farm undercuts any idyllic fantasies of rural life, though there are compensations. ""Green Acres"" this aint!!Hers is a tale of plucky self-reliance as an (aging) but still spry single woman. Sweet honey in the rock, indeed.Hubbell's description of nature at times is so lyrical that it soars to the threshold of poetry.Worth reading and savoring for its understated charms."
3,"Pleasant book, but is that enough?","Sue Hubbell takes us on a yearlong tour of her Missouri Ozarks farm. Why did I buy this book? I live on 3 acres of land in rural northern California, and like Ms H. I have an interest in the many, diverse creatures that walk, crawl, and fly around my property. I hoped to dig into a book stuffed with anecdotes, facts, and trivia about the wonders of nature. While the reader is provided with some interesting information about the world around us, much of the book is just a reflection of life on a small bee farm. Pleasant musings, perhaps, but not enough for me.This modest volume neither suffices as informative natural history or spiritual odyssey."
4,Works as described.,I bought this because I have a few rare games that I don't want damaged. In fact two of them are selling here on amazon for over a hundred dollars each. Emulation is great but has errors and other issues. So this little device allows me to play my backups with no problems. As others have stated you must have a PlayStation with a parallel port. This is not the same a the PSONE serial port. You will find little in the way of documentation with the package. A quick Google search gave me a lot more info than what came in the box. I would print out whatever you find because sites devoted to the aged PlayStation hardware are becoming a relic of the past. So all in all this was a nice find for the price and I recommend buying one if you want to preserve your PlayStation software.
1,Not the same product anymore,"Previously, this Dermalogica masque was amazing. It was a clear gel that absorbed into the skin well and left it feeling soft. The product has since changed. I received a mask that was the consistency of snot, not at all it's original clear gel form! It was milky yellow. When I tried to wash it off my face after 15 minutes, it left a greasy film on my skin. I had to go back and use another facial cleanser to wash the greasy feeling off my face. This mask is no longer what it used to be and I will definitely not buy this product again!"
2,Not for really sensitive skin,"I purchased this product hoping it would work for my very very sensitive skin. It did not sting when applied so I thought it would be good. However, each time I used this product I developed a rash on my face next morning, so I had to throw this product away after three uses."
3,Throne of Isis,"Judith Tarr writes well. Her language flows, and that's what keeps this book readable.On the other hand, to me what keeps it from being a really good book is the fact that very little of interest (to me, anyway) happens. Romances and the upbringing of children take up a vast portion of the lengthy text. Battle scenes get only tantalizing hints. The portrayal of magic is intriguing but too often veers into the silly (as in the childbirth scene, which I found laughable).I'm not an expert on the period; what I see here seems accurate enough to me. I think it's important to remember that even though characters portrayed in historical fiction are ""real people"", in the context of literature, they're still fictional characters--and Cleopatra's ugliness or beauty is a matter of great indifference to me. The characters as written here are sufficiently vivid; the problem is that they don't get more active roles to play."
4,A Minimally Brighter Side of Lloyd,"Having cheerfulness break out in a Lloyd Cole CD is about as likely as having it break out in a Leonard Cohen work. But just as LC has taken to admitting on his version of the NeverEnding Tour that it does keep breaking out, even in the bleakest of moments, here too we have Lloyd in some cheerful moments. It's not constant and it's certainly not for always, but it is nonetheless clearly there. See, for example, Woman in a Bar, New York City Sunshine, I Didn't See It Coming, an, especially, Every Song, where happy is almost a theme.This CD also establishes Lloyd in retrospect as the first prophet of the 2008 financial apocalypse -- ""Fortune hits the wall/And the whole 500 fall/How wrong can you be?/How wrong can you be?""Otherwise, it's the same Lloyd from Rattlesnakes days with the Commotions -- reliably musical, intelligent, and genially gloomy and resigned, the Eeyore of Pop. I've always liked him and most likely always will."
4,"gorgeous, restrained, evocative, heartbreaking","i have loads of lloyd's early stuff--then recently got back into him withthe negatives record...since then, he's put out a mess of records and it's beena bit hard to keep up. the strings on this CD are quite astonishing--and his voice is in fine fettle. a very confident, skip-along, chimy effort.instantly likeable/hummable.RIYL: Robyn Hitchcock, the black watch, Pernice Brothers, and have ever heard any Lloyd Cole.i am rushing to buy the records i have missed in the past couple of years now!"
4,Massachusetts songsmith part 2,"Just to clarify. Lloyd is not American, not Scottish, but English. He is often confused as Scottish as he and his band the Commotions came out of Scotland in the 1980s. He left the UK, and moved to NYC around 1990, and later settled in Northampton, MA.This album, by the way, is fantastic as are all his albums. Buy them, if you want to hear great songs from a great songwriter."
5,PURE PLEASURE,"I RECENTLY BECAME AWARE OF THIS BOOK AFTER READING CHINABERRY.MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT I DIDN'T READ IT YEARS AGO.THIS BOOK IS A HONEST,COMPASSIONATE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPLEXIETIES OF THE TIME,PLACE AND PEOPLE OF EASTERN KY DURING THE DEPRESSION.MY BACKGROUND IS SOUTH CENTRAL RURAL KY BUT I CAN CERTAINLY IDENTIFY WITH THE CHARACTERS IN THIS NOVEL.THIS BOOK IS A MASTERPIECE. I THANK GOD FOR TALENTED PEOPLE SUCH AS JAMES STILL."
3,Sonar 4 Review,"The Sonar 4 was shipped and delivered quickly - thank you. It functions as expected. I am concerned, however, that because it's a knock off I will be unable to get updates which may affect its performance in the future. All in all it performs as expected - again, thank you!"
3,Glad I tried it,"Canus Goat's Milk Fragrance Free Bar Soap, Five-Ounce Bars in 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)I was surprised that this soap smells so much like a goat and could not imagine using it with that smell. Luckily the longer it is out of the box the more the smell lessens but does not go away completely. So I started using it sparingly and have not had the goat smell linger on my skin. It sudses nicely and softens the skin. This is not enough reason for me to purchase it again. I wonder if the fragranced bar has a better smell to it."
4,Viva Cuba is a wonderful film,We showed this film for our Spanish club movie night at our college and it got rave reviews from young adults from age 18 all the way up to the non-traditional older students. It is a touching film about listening to your children and the language is reasonably clean in the show too. Lots of humour and drama. Money well spent! You will not regret getting this film for your own collection or if you teach high school or junior college.
3,Viva Cuba,"This was a very touching and true reality of the struggles in old Cuba,When two kids growing up from same cultures, but different families.Venture out to find the girl's... Father, and on the way rediscover themselves. I've truly enjoy watching this movie. Bravo!!"
5,Movie Content,"This is a great services from shipping to delivery. I have no issues at all and I recommend this video, talk about the reality that is lived in Cuba and the constrain of the population. In addition, show the commitment of the authority, however no sure is this true. Not at lease the 6 time that I visited Cuba back in 1990. But overall is a great movie and I hope to see more coming."
5,Leave the kids alone ;),"Two school friends embark on a journey across Cuba in order to reach the girl's father who can help her to complete her wish: stay in Cuba instead of immigrating to the States. While their parents and Cuban police are looking for them all over the country, the kids get into various adventures and get their friendship 'tested'.Funny and moving story where kids turn out to be much wiser then adults (with revolution spirit attached)."
1,Obvious Question,How can there be class differences between the kids if they live in a nation that's been communist for over 60 years? Wasn't the whole point of La Revolucion to do away with those kinds of distinctions?
3,I expect more from Grauwels,"Marc Grauwels is one of my favorite living flutists. His sound, technique, intonation and time are usually exquisite and beyond reproach. I take issue with his performances on this recording on two fronts. First, he consistently plays horribly sharp above A4 or so. Second, the choice of material is positively reactionary. Most of the recording is performed on soprano flute and marimba: limited colors at best but this performance utilizes no extended techniques and hardly makes a contemporary statement. One might say that the recording is a little ""dinosauric"". There is so much great repertoire for flutes and percussion... Mr. Grauwels has hardly scratched the surface of the literature here."
5,Indeed it's quiet,"My older computer started to shutdown unexpectedly and repeatedly.Upon checking the older power supply with a testing device it was found defective.This one was very easy to install, works great and is indeed less noisy then the previous one.I guess it's a great buy for the money."
3,Defense,"Mr. Arnsparger obviously knows his football and the book does a good job compiling complete information on how to play complex defensive football. Unfortunately, Mr. Arnsbarger is not a writer and the book sorely needs a good editor. Many terms are used but not defined until later in the book which causes much confusion."
2,Too scheme specific,I found this book to be way too specific to Coach Arnsbarger's scheme. That is great if you are starting a defense from scratch or want to revamp your system. We already have an effective scheme and a successful defense. I was looking for something that would just make us better. I did not find it in this book. Just my two cents.
5,Simple and Effective way of broadening your tarot knowledge,"This book is a wonderful addition to your standard favorite tarot guide. It gives you simple everyday practice that makes learning the tarot more enjoyable. All of the enties are easy to comprehend and apply. The best part of this book is that it can be used many times over. You will always learn something new about the cards because they are not predetermined, you pick one or more to study. Excellent read."
5,Fun and a great learning experience to become more intimate with your cards.,McElroy provides information and exercises to enhance how you look at your cards. He's funny and witty. There's rarely a dull moment in reading. He keeps it light and relevant as well as interesting. I'm truly enjoying it.
5,The book provides readers with a vital examination of black,"Using the Sea Islands as a foundation, Mictchell provides readers with a fascinating and vital examination of Black folk medicine. Hoodoo Medicine also details cures used in the Sea Islands and the book includes a dreictory ofmedicinal roots and herbs. With a burgeoning interest in ""traditonal"" practices, I hope this book will find its way into the hands of professionals and lay people eager to support healing and wellness."
5,Ground Breaking Study,"The healing traditions of African American herbalists have been largely overlooked, called backwards or adaptations of other traditions. Faith Mitchell systemically refutes these claims in her concise overview of our ways of working herbs. ""Hoodoo Medicine"" belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in African American healing or multicultural herbalism. Though written several years ago, Mitchell's lovely book remains a powerful and inspirational affirmation of African wisdom in the New World."
3,Good recipes; lousy binding,"The book contains straightforward, easy recipes that let good ingredients shine through. It's a good reference for recipes suitable for every day home cooking. But the binding is atrocious! Clumps of pages started falling out after my first use of the book. That shouldn't happen with a book [of this price]. As a result, I wouldn't bother buying the book unless it came at a VERY steep discount."
5,Six Sigma Neophyte,"As a practicing physician, I have found this book to be helpful in increasing the efficiency of my staff and the overall performance of my office. The book's ease of use allowed for rapid implementation of some of the Six Sigma principles for problem solving. The user-friendly text made a complicated technical system realistic and accessible to this neophyte. I highly recommend this book for any professional who wants to improve the quality of the work environment."
5,Understanding the Power of SIx Sigma,"This book is an excellent guide for people who want to know, what is Six Sigma? The authors inform you that Six Sigma is more than a bunch of statistics in a production environment, but also a culture that can be applied to any organization. There is a section; however, that covers the statistical tools used by Six Sigma professionals. They provide important information on how to use the DMAIC model and what it can do for your organization. It covers the key points of implementing Six Sigma and how to measure processes by looking for the ""vital few"" variables"".I highly recommend this book for anyone considering implementing Six Sigma or those who want to know more about this powerful culture. It is well written in terms that can be easily understood by all."
1,In my opinion NOT worth the time or money,Well...just another book on six sigma that does not take the time to demonstrate what it is covering.
1,Way too complicated,I gave up reading this as it was very detailed and complicated. Not why I buy Dummy books. I want it simple. This book did not deliver.
4,A Relevant and Helpful Introduction to Six Sigma,"""Six Sigma for Dummies"" offers a good overview of Six Sigma as a methodology, in addition to offering context on the history and benefits of Six Sigma.Craig Gygi, Neil DeCarlo, and Bruce Williams offer a practical and usable guide to Six Sigma at a high enough level for beginners to the practice of Six Sigma, while providing tools and techniques that are detailed enough to implement and use right away.More of a beginner's guide than anything else, ""Six Sigma for Dummies"" is a good and worthwhile introduction to the powerful Six Sigma methodology. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about what Six Sigma ""is"" and how it can be...and is...used across the world today."
4,NABMP Endorsed! A Suitable Starting Point for 6-S.,"This book is a suitable tool for those who wish to learn more about Six Sigma. It can get a little too complicated in some parts if you are not already familiar with certain aspects of Six Sigma, however it may still serve as a helpful reference guide. If you are a college grad with any kind of business degree, Six Sigma material should be a part of your library. Our recommendation is to look at Six Sigma as a philosophy as well as a business operations modality. Such an outlook may aid in the understanding of the material. If you are embarking on the program, get this book along with the BIG 6S handbook, as well as a toolbox companion, this should give you a foundational reference pack for learning and implementation. Peter Theo, Business Management Consultant, National Association of Business Management Professionals, [...]"
2,basics,this book covers the basics and gives a good overview. if you are serious about 6 sigma there are several books that are much better. this is a good starter.
4,Six Sigma for Dummies,"I think it is a great book. The subject is very complicated, but the writer tries to break it down into little pieces."
4,I like it.,"I'm a bigger guy (size 44 waist pants). I bought the XXL fishing vest, and it fits nice. I decided I needed one of these, so I wouldn't need a floating tackle box when wading in the river, lol! Also, I needed to put my pocket gun higher up on my body, so it wouldn't get wet. I have a small Diamondback DB9 pistol, and it's just small enough to fit in the top pocket. I'd say any other gun wouldn't fit in the top pocket 'cause the pocket is just too small (with the exception of other pocket guns like the pocket .380 calibers). The inside pockets are even smaller. I also kinda wish that The vest had less cotton in it. However, it does serve its purpose though, and I think it's a nice vest."
4,Handy,"I've been using a similar Columbia multi-pocket vest for almost 30 years and decided to replace the now tatty old one, which I rate 5 stars. Comparing old and new: the material in the new vest is thinner and the pockets are smaller. Items I used to be able to put in smaller front pocket now has to go in the larger of two pairs of front pockets. Some items are more prone to fall out unless zipped. The plastic zippers aren't as sturdy as old metal zippers. But I still like the new vest compared to ads for other brands of new multi-pockets. But I really don't think this one would last for almost 30 years."
4,not bad,"The mere fact that this product exists is really the most helpful. I had to clean paint from old cast iron radiators. All the scroll work etc. took days and hours with our previous strategy of scrapers and dentil picks. This tool is great. However it starts to leak air after about 2 hours of continuous use and only works intermittently. That was kind of frustrating. I'd have gone with a better made scaler if I'd have known that. You have to give the tool a break for a couple of hours, then its back to normal operation. Really handy, Love the pistol grip for the job that I had. And even with the problems I had, it saved me days of work and did a very nice job."
4,Interesting and worth reading,Book is a good summary of differences in Eastern and Western thought. Great if you are doing business or have some interaction between the cultures
4,I liked the book,"The Geography of thought is a pretty good book, content-wise. I learned a lot, since I hadn't come accross this topic before. Very interesting, surprising and informative. Certain thing I didn't like, though. Sometimes I felt that the author keeps writing about the same thing over and over again. But overall, the book gave me a lot and helped me understand certain differences between the two cultures."
3,Interesting but turns too academic,"The topic is fascinating and the author is obviously a subject matter expert. I commend him for it, but the book gets a bit too academic after about the 3rd chapter and becomes too dry for the lay person to continue reading with great interest. I found myself skimming most of it after chapter 3."
4,Great psychology book,"This is a book about philosophy and psychology that challenges the idea that there are core cognitive processes across cultures. It compares Eastern (Asian) and Western (European and American) cultures to make the point. It's only about 240 pages and can be read in a day or two. It examines how even our most basic assumptions about core human thought processes don't hold up when viewed across cultues.This is an excellent book that should be required reading for any psychology student. It not only highlights the power of cultural influences, but is also points out tons of issues to take into consideration while conducting psycholical research.I give it 4 stars because it might not be as accessable to the casual reader due to the emphasis on psychological experiments."
5,East vs. West,"Having grown up with Western values while living in the East, I can attest to the fact that Easterners and Westerners think differently. Western civilization has been shaped by the Greeks and then the Enlightenment. It is all about progress. Eastern philosophy, on the other hand, originated from the Chinese and is about balance and harmony. They offer very different views of the world.I have found it to be almost impossible for Easterners and Westerners to truly understand how the other thinks as they can't help but see the other through their own cultural lenses. But other than living in a foreign country for an extended period of time, reading this book is the next best option."
4,Very Informative,"I bought this book as a foundation for a graduate level study on differences between Eastern and Western thought and I could not be happier. Incredibly informative, yet reads as an enertainment book."
1,Disappointed,"I am disappointed in the author's historical assessment of the ancient world. Many authors intentionally exclude the significant role of the Persians and their influences on the human development and thought process through literature, poetry, mathematics, architect, science, democratic government, the bill of rights, ...etc. Persians were in power far beyond 2500 years ago and the only ruling empire expanding from borders of China to Morocco. Today, whatever we see in any of these geographical areas we can find the path leading us to the ancient Persian Empire. China and Greece gained enormous knowledge from Persians. The entire middle east, southern Europe and northern Africa have their civilization rooted in Persian culture. Read more about the unbiased history and report it in your future books and give the credit to those who truly deserve it, The PERSIANS."
4,Love Blue Collar!,"This of the three editions was not my favorite, but it was still great comedy. Bill was my favorite. I would recomend this movie to anyone who loves a good laugh and has seen these guys before!"
3,Not Quite As Funny as Before,"The Blue Collar Comedy Tour features well known ""redneck comedians"" Ron White, Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and the headliner, Jeff Foxworthy. This is the third video in the series and was filmed in Washington, D.C.All four of these stand-up comedians are funny but this particular show just did not live up to the first two in the series. While the jokes are new, they just weren't as cleverly delivered and just not quite as entertaining. Like the last two videos, the best part is when all four of them sit down together at the end and crack jokes. The special features are okay but nothing special.While I didn't enjoy this video as much as the others, it's still a lot of fun to watch and something you can stick in for a few laughs just about any time."
3,Blue Collar Comedy Tour - One For The Road ( Full Screen Edition),"I like this movie but didn't find it as funny as the first two. It was still great and gave us all a few laughs, but not as many as hoped for!"
3,Dissapointing,"Sadly, this was not as good as the first two which rocked. I love the blue collar comedy movies, but this one just wasn't that funny. Don't get me wrong, each of the boys have their moments. Just as a whole, I don't think anything will top the second one. Granted, I will probably still buy it, but you may be better off buy ""you can't fix stupid"" as that was absolutley hysterical."
1,that was stupid...,"yawn.totally pointless to watch. it was about as funny as a fart joke(which are not funny btw). i guess i don't think its funny because i'm not a ""red neck"". sorry but the cable guy blows. as i said before, ron white is the only funny guy on here. the rest are lame. if you like something actually funny then i suggest dane cook or Jim Gaffigan, maybe even lewis black. but if you're a moron then yeah i'd stick with the fart jokes....."
4,Recommended for fans of doom or power electronics,"The product description for this album is incredibly weak--""more like an album of sound effects""? Come on....Sure there are a lot of creepy sounds in here, but they are masterfully composed. It's a really unique sound as well, incorporating field recordings/found sounds, PE-esque analog synth gurgles, harsh noise type feedback squalls & dark ambient cave echoes and rumbles. Incredibly creepy but drone enough to relax to...until the random scream comes crashing through.Highly recommended if you're a fan of anything from Lustmord to Whitehouse to David Lynch soundtracks."
5,A masterpiece,An exceptionally well-written account of facts and historic events that contibutes validity to Walter Rodney's case. Clearly an enormous amount of research was done for this analysis to be as clear cut and decisive as it illustrated. A fantastic piece of armor for any student or intellectual of African/World History. We were so captivated by this book that we have made it a point to relay its information to all that we know and have even given it as a gift to many of our friends and family menbers world wide.
4,I used this book in my ESL class last summer,"I used this book in my ESL class last summer. The material was appropriate for my capability, and it will be much more helpful if you study in teacher-led class."
5,"Different from American Movies, but Good","I love the concept of the original story called ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" by Yasutaka Tsutsui (the book from which this movie jumps off). I've read the book and seen the manga version of ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" that was released in 2006.Unlike the anime, the protagonist in the movie doesn't play around much. She is on a mission to find someone from her mother's past. There are, of course, complications, but what good story doesn't have any? The movie has a really good ending, but I wouldn't necessarily classify it as happy. That's one key way in which Japanese movies can differ from American ones.As another reviewer said, the quality isn't perfect, but I think the story and the acting is good enough that watching this movie is totally justified. There are plot twists that I never saw coming, and it kept the movie very interesting. I highly recommend it!"
2,Love time travel movie,"This one was not what I wanted to see, it may be worth it for you to watch but had I had known I would have rented it."
5,Watch this movie.,Watch this movie you will love it.If you love Japanese movies like I do then you will love every minute of this film.
5,I feel nostalgic seeing this book on sale online,"Good book for students new to field of Electronics. This is the first book i read on ""Electronics"" (in high school grade 11, 12). It created so much passion in me for the field of electronics that i saw myself doing an undergrad course in electrical engineering (am doing my masters too in the same field now). I also returned to this book on a number of occasions during my entire undergraduate course. The book is written in a very student friendly fashion. I used to love reading it. The other book i used by the same author: Digital Principles by Malvino and Leach was the first book i read on digital electronics (in high school grade 12, undergrad school). Both these books just reflect the richness in the writing style of the author. Best of luck, new techies!!! :)"
4,goood basic book,if you just started in electronics this is the book you need. excelent book for beginners
2,great explanations.. but very basic,"some of the explanations (actually.. a lot of the explanations) are amazing.. but the analysis is basic...he shouldn't use the first (ideal) approximation to show us clipps, clampers, etc. etc...many times in the book.. the ideal approximation is used... which is only good for troubleshooting..."
4,This Material is amazing,"Pros:This material is amazing and works great for speaker isolation. It's surprisingly heavy compared to standard isolation foam.The sticky/fastening surface on the bottom is convenient, but make sure where ever you stick it that you plan on not moving it... it's not easy to remove from a clean flat surface.Cons:Not terribly easy to cut, standard razor blades or scissors will not make clean cuts in this since it's 1-1/4"" thick.Tips:You may want to buy a long blade box cutter or use one of those old paper chop boards with the chopping paper cuter arm if you want a clean edge when you size it."
1,too cheaply made,"I bought several packages of these in August, they have already been relegated to the trash. The elastic is hanging in threads, sometimes after only 1 or 2 times in the washing machine (front loader), no dryer. I expected at least a nod toward quality, never again."
2,too high,"I thought these panties were comfortable when I first put them on, but after I wore them with a pair of jeans that were a little below my waist, the waistband kept rolling down."
5,Excellent Briefs But.....,"I was very disapointed that it was not the actual colors they showed in this picture for example. Those were the colors i wanted instead. And instead of that i got this off peach off green, pastel colores instead. That is the only thing i was disapointed with. Thank you."
4,Hane's Women's Panties bought through Amazon,"What can I say? They arrived in the original packaging rather quickly. They are as advertised the right size too. They're panties rather low tech, the fit they look good I would buy them again. The colors aren't may favorites but their underwear so who cares?"
2,Poor Quality,I have bought Hanes underwear for years. These are my favorite style but the quality seems to be getting worse and worse. The seams do not hold up for more than one or two wearings. I think someone at Hane's needs to be checking into changing the way the seams are done. Hate cotton underwear but may have to end up buying them.
1,Died within 9 months,"I used the keyboard succesfully for several months. It was perfect for use with my computer connected to my TV. However, in the last few weeks it started working sporadically. I replaced the batteries twice and each time it worked again for a day or two but then it stops. It was not too expensive but I was hoping for at least a year of work."
4,WIRELESS KEYBOARD,I LIKE THIS KEYBOARD. IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL. THE JOYSTICK MOUSE IS TRICKY TO LEARN TO USE BUT I'M GETTIN BETTER AT IT.
3,Good for PC bad for PS3,"This keyboard was designed for the living room or classroom. The keyboard is compact and sturdy. It is strong enough to sit on your lap or grip with two hands to the side. What I like is the very responsive keypad. The mouse pad is convenient and is like a game console controller joystick. I returned this after the compatibility issues with the PS3, but it worked fine on a PC. For the PS3 I loose signal after exiting the PS3 web-browser and have to reset the keyboard many times. There are trigger buttons in the front.There are also Bluetooth rechargeable keyboards from Logitech. The RF range on this pad is good. It is at a great price, but need to be more compatible with the PS3. Interlink's Versapoint is a similar product. Its cost twice as much but it works on the PS3 and PC. Sadly, its mouse is not as good as this one."
1,broke after 2 months,decent while it lasted; unfortunetky after 2 months the keyboard started acting up. I'm using my x-360 controller as mouse; the mouse on the controller is actualy better then on the keyboard
5,High quality wireless 'couch' keyboard,"I've had this keyboard for years now and it is still working quite well for me. They keys are not cramped and it even has a full size backspace! The keyboard has a quality feel to it and a decent tactile feedback on the keys. Works great for a HTPC setup. The handles are great for when you want to pick it up and the bottom is contoured to your legs. The joystick works well if you don't want to have a separate mouse to loose (trust me, I lost a Gyration mouse before this...I think it fell off the arm of the couch and into the garbage!). Although it's not as fast as a mouse it gets the job done for occasional/light use. It helps to turn up your mouse acceleration on your PC to max. The software will let you know how good your batteries are and gives you some shortcuts on the joystick so you don't have to move the mouse pointer quite as much."
3,"Very handy, but a bit oversensitive joystick",I'm happy with this purchase. Why 3 instead of 5 stars? -1 because the joystick is a bit oversensitive. I can't really get used to it. Makes it difficult to maneuver on the screen. -1 because they originally they sent me a NONAME brand keyboard and I had to wait for this one for 2 weeks. Overall the keyboard is very handy and a nice design for this price.
2,"An exposition of an obvious, but neglected idea.","Dubois has one good idea, that pre-Christian religions in Scandinavia influenced each other. This should be obvious - people travelled a lot in that time, as traders, raiders and mercenaries. Sami and Norse intermarried. However, few scholars have mentioned this before, so Dubois does fill a need.He also manages to avoid the ""all pre-Christian Germanic heathen religions are the same"" trap, another point that should be obvious, but that is often glossed over. However, Dubois doesn't emphasize that quite as much. This is a pity, since a good, scholarly comparative work on this subject is much needed.For some reason, this has become an instant Asatruar classic. So, if you are Asatruar, you probably need to own this. If not, borrow a copy from the library. There isn't enough non-obvious thought here to justify owning it."
4,Ok not great,"I have been taking these pills for quite some time now. I am getting ready to become pregnant and this is my third bottle. The only reason I have stuck to this brand is because the size is the smallest I have been able to find. THe downside is that it makes my stomach feel awful after taking the pill. I feel nausea and terrible cramps. ---Yes, I always take it with meals but I have found that if I take them right before bed I avoid the symptoms. Another problem is the taste--they taste terrible and leave a horrible after taste in my mouth.Still looking for a better fit. But I'll continue taking these until I find a better pill."
4,"Easy to swallow, inexpensive, but they do smell","In comparison to the other ""horse-pill"" prenatal vitamins out there, these are a godsend! I do understand what the other reviewers are saying when they mentioned the strong smell. The smell is strong, but I don't think it's a terribly offensive odor. In my opinion they simply have a strong vitamin smell. I never noticed them tasting bad, but maybe it's because I take them with Orange Juice. I tried the Stewart's vitamins that another reviewer suggested for my next round, and they are a bit longer, but are more narrow than the Pregnancy Plus. They are also coated and so I think they are just as easy to swallow as the Pregnancy Plus and they do not have an odor or taste at all. The only draw back is they are twice as expensive as the Pregnancy Plus brand."
1,Waste of money!,"Do not buy these vitamins. I have a very hard time swallowing large pills, so I specifically bought these pills because they were advertised as being small. The pills are flatter than most of the prenatal vitamins I have seen, but they are still large. And if the size does not get you, the smell will. I almost gagged from the smell when I opened them up. Do not waste your money on these, you will come back an unsatisfied customer!I suggest to those with trouble swallowing large pills to try Stuart's prenatal vitamins."
1,Manufacturer has changed ingredients!! : (,"pregnancy Plus has now included titanium dioxide and polyethylene glycol in this product! :( check the ""other ingredients"" list on your bottle. I won't be using this product anymore. Sad to see these changes... I'm guessing money had something to do w/ it.. cheaper to produce using these unhealthy ingredients."
2,Strong odor and taste,I'm not a pregnant women but am very sensitive to strong vitamin tastes and they tend to upset my stomach. I ordered these thinking that if they are made for preganant women that they should be easy to take. They are easy to swallow and easy to digest but the smell and taste are awful. It is so strong that when I open my bottle it stinks up my kitchen. My whole family gags at the smell. Since I already paid for 60 tablets I swallow them with food to overcome the taste. I don't know if a pregnant woman who may be sensitive to smells and taste can take these.
5,Great vitamin,"It was difficult for me to find a vegetarian prenatal vitamin that isn't loaded with herbal extracts and doesn't contain several times more than the recommended daily allowance for certain vitamins and minerals. Who really needs 588% of B1? I also have trouble swallowing large pills, so the small size of this vitamin is a plus. I don't mind taking a separate calcium supplement instead of trying to swallow large pills. Some other reviewers have complained about the smell of the vitamins, but I have no problem with how they smell. How many vitamins are fragrant anyway? These vitamins also do not upset my stomach. I had a very upset stomach during my first trimester and I could tolerate these vitamins, whereas I could not tolerate one of the other leading brands of vegetarian vitamins that I tried. I plan to continue to take this vitamin throughout the remainder of my pregnancy and while I'm breastfeeding. I feel fortunate that I found this vitamin! Thank you, Amazon.com!"
4,Good so far,"I purchased these vitamins because 1.) the good balance of various vitamins, as other reviewers have noted, and 2.) because in FDA studies these have one of the lowest lead counts of any of the prenatals they tested (0.189 mcg per daily dose... the highest tested had nearly 9 mcg per dose... Big difference!). The vitamin A is all in beta carotene form. I've only been taking them a few days but like them so far. There is a vitamin smell, but I don't find it potent at all nor that different from any other vitamin on the market. The downsides to this product are that it doesn't have any calcium, and the iron is less than the recommended amount for pregnant women, only 18 mg in this vitamin versus the 27 mg that's recommended (I'm not pregnant yet so I'm not worried about that now, but when I am I will have to make sure I get iron in my diet to make up for that). I also wish this vitamin had magnesium and selenium. But at this point, this product works for me!"
4,Very Interesting Book,"Very interesting book years ahead in talking about the troubles we now face. I would assume this would be brought back out given the state of the war on terrorism. Ok so he does not have a boatload of facts, but that was in 1992 - look at what has happened over the past 10 years. He comments were right on. There are lost of interesting stories from Africa to Europe and central Asia. This book provides a look into the French intelligence agency that for me a new given that most books in the area deal with the CIA, MI5 or the KGB. If you read this book you will be talking about it to your friends for weeks after you have finished it. The book is written well and keeps moving, it does not get bogged down in ""the French are the best"" hyperbole."
3,smashes,If your peas are not completely ready then you will have problems with them getting stuck.It takes practice on which peas works good in the machine. It is not the worst but not the best.
2,"small peas yes, large or butter beans no",Was wanting this to work. guess i will buy the bigger one. works great on purple hull / blackeye peas fine but does not work for the larger peas or butter beans. Sending back to try the 280.00 model.
2,More like a Pea Masher,"This is more like a Pea Masher than a sheller. I like my peas and beans tender, but they have to be pretty tough to survive this sheller. Plus, the unit is so short, only a small, shallow bowl will fit to catch the peas/beans. Overall, I found it mashed too many good beans and left too much fibrous matter on the beans."
2,pea killer,I found the pea sheller not worth the time. We purchased a more expensive one that works well. You get what you pay for.
1,Bad Product,"This is the only item that I have purchased through Amazon that I did not like. I am going to try to return it and get my money back. First you have to figure out how to mount it so you can use it. Then you have to figure out how to run only perfect pea pods through it. I gashed a finger on it because the edges are too sharp. It scratched my counter. It sits too low, mashes some of the peas, (if the pods aren't the perfect size), makes a mess of crushed pods and pea juice, and it doesn't stay tight. I could go on but...."
4,mr pea sheller,"Bought this pea sheller to shell peas from my garden and found it to be a great investment for the money. Although it is a small gadget it shells peas at a pretty fast pace. Workws good with a blender or hand crank, but is only for the home gardener."
2,not worth the time,THIS PEASHELLER DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS.IT MASHES AND MANGLESTHE PEAS.The peas were ripe mostly yellow easy to shell by hand.It will not shell larger peas.Sorry but this expensive toy is notwhat the ad claims.Harvey Dwayne Trotter
2,Quality,Product is of very poor quality with sharp edges on the stamped out metal. It would not shell sweet peas any faster than by hand. It does a good jop on Blackeye peas and field peas. The attaching method leaves no room for a bowl to set properly and will not attach to a regular counter edge (1 1/2 inch)
1,Too small,"It's possible that this thing works, but not with the nice-sized telephone pole peas that I grow. They won't fit through the slot."
5,Perfect for Southern Peas,"We use this sheller for southern peas, also known as cowpeas or crowder peas. It works perfectly. Cranking it by hand works just fine. I think it works just as fast by hand as with an electric drill....but my friend likes the drill better. Either way, the sheller will do a 5 gallon bucket in about 45 minutes - that was for pink eye purple hulled peas. It is somewhat cheaply made...but unless you hit it with a hammer, it should last for years. I would say that it is made appropriately for the task. Definitely a fair price for the amount of work it saves. Hand shelling leaves you with a slightly cleaner bowl of peas.....but unless you enjoy spending hours on the front porch shelling by hand, use the sheller!"
2,Amazon Pea Sheller,The Lee Pea Sheller worked great the first two times of use. Then the rollers started slipping and would not allow the pea pods to enter between the two rollers. Do not know if it can be repaired. It would have been great if it had continued working as it did in the begining.
5,Whats not to love about Shirely,"The best of is a bit much because Shirley Horn has a deep bench and wide range of vocal talent. Example is Miles Davis on horn on ""You won't forget Me"" if you ever been in love, this is a anthem, it just weaves around and recalls past moments of your first, present or last love. This CD swings, hums, cries and shouts, 14 tracks of just good listening, thinking and lov'n take a moment or hell a day and enjoy."
5,Hidden Pictures,Delivery was timely as promised. The item was the exact quality promised. I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again.
1,My dog got used to the tiny air pop and sound so quick it only deterred him for a week.,My dog got used to the tiny air pop and sound so quick it only deterred him for a week.
4,"Worked, mostly.","First, my cats no longer defecate and urinate on the landing of my stairs, so in that regard, this product was a success. However, I found it to be somewhat sporadic. Sometimes, I or the cats would walk by right in front it and it wouldn't go off. Then a few minutes later, I would just climb the stairs and it would go off when I was still 6 - 10 feet away. The good thing is, it goes off often enough that the cats learned to stay away. I only had a problem with my big Tom who figured out he could knock it over. I had to put it in a base and now the cats stay away.So while it isn't fool-proof, it seemed to do the trick in the end."
4,It works as described/,Worked well for me. Just wish it had bigger range. Im using it in my basement and need a few of them to really do the trick.
5,Works like a charm/,"Set it for spray and tone, then, after just a couple week, set it to tone only. Cats stay far away and don't bother the couch at all, even the back of the couch. There is a cheaper unit, made by Innotech which I am trying as well. Seems like the same unit."
3,"work well, but shouldn't they last longer?","I can't remember exactly how long ago I purchased 4 of these, but it's been about a year. Certainly less than 2 years. They are not cheap! So the cost of 4 is a significant expense. I find that they do work well if you can get them aimed correctly so as to discourage the cats but not scare yourself to death by setting it off accidentally. The sound alone is all that's needed, really. The hissing spray will not only scare the perpetrator, but clear the entire room of every cat in it. The problem is that the motion activation sensors have stopped working on all but 3 of the cans. I changed out batteries and tested them in turn. One will work every now and then, 2 are completely dead, 1 still works. I've ordered 3 more because I can't find a good alternative ..."
1,Didn't work.,"It doesn't spay, just makes a sound that intrigues the cat but doesn't scare it away.The product didn't work for me, I got it put the sensor on top of the compressed air and turned on the switch to spray/sound. The cat gets near it and the sound goes (beep, beep, beep) and the cat simply looks at it.I called their customer service in hopes that they might be able to help but got a message ""Saying that their customer service was closed, that they were available from 7am to 7pm pacific time"" and it was late (Monday) morning.Tried to return it to Amazon but they won't accept it because it's classified has hazardous.This product received positive reviews, which made me get the product, but my experience wasn't great."
1,Don't buy this!,"I ordered this thing and it's a piece of crap. I had it set to spray and alarm and when the motion detecter was set off, all it would do is beep incessently for 10 minutes until I had to finally shut it off to make it stop. Because it's classified as ""hazardous materials"" (yet pet safe????), I can't even return it. I'm out $50 between the unit and the refill cans. Not happy AT ALL!!!"
1,2 Out of 2 Didn't Work- Cannot Return Due to Aerosol,"The first model worked for a full aerosol can. I ordered a replacement can. The spray unit stopped working. We ordered a new spray unit and it didn't work AT ALL. Because it is an aerosol it cannot be returned via mail, which means it cannot be returned at all. That's $80 for nothing. Don't do it! Don't buy it!"
1,Refill.,I ordered a refill canister with my original order. When the first canister ran out I connected the refill canister but it was empty. Returns are only valid for 30 days and obviously more than 30 days elapsed before the first canister ran out. I don't see any link to the vendor so I am writing this review.
3,Stay-Away,Does scare the cat off the counter - but goes off intermittently when nothing is setting it off especially when first turned on. Does seem to stop after a couple misfires.
1,Simply doesn't work,"Two cats peeing by the front door, so I set one up. It never, ever worked. It only makes the noise when I'm turning it on or off, and it's on off for good.The product insert says to elevate it a few inches. Man, you could give this thing a hot air balloon tour and it still wouldn't matter. I am EXTREMELY disappointed and feel very jipped. The seller should DEFINITELY allow an exchange, even if just the motion sensor and sound part (I don't use the spray). I really wanted this to work, but it doesn't."
2,Naughty cat,Product not easy to use. The air blast insufficient to scare a pet with a narrow spray. The horn worked on my cat but not very loud. Horn sensor did not always activate or sounded at the wrong time. Response time too slow for an agile cat. Gave up on using it. Did not work for my counter top and doubt it would work in a doorway with a quick moving pet. Would not repurchase.
2,"STAY AWAY from the ""Cotech Stayaway Motion Pet Deterrent""","I Purchased the ""Stay Away Motion Pet Deterrent"" and It did not work properly. I set it up and would wave my hand back and forth in front of it. It would work about 40% of the time in waving my hand. I called the company and they were very good about sending me a replacement one right away. The second one worked a lot better but was also defective. It would go off and keep going off even if you were not in front of the motion sensor part, but off to the side and way away from it, it would go off. How it did help regarding my cat was because it caught her in the act of getting on the counters a few times, after that I could simply place the Motion detector on the counter and that helped to detour my cat at times. However, it was not consistant enough to resolve the issue. I would not recommend the purchase of this item."
4,StayAway,"Although this is quite expensive, it did the trick in keeping my cat from doing his business in an unacceptable spot."
4,Would buy again,Stay a way realy works! I would recommed it to anyone who is having problems with your cat spraying. The one and only problem I have is sometimes it will just goes off. Which would not be a big deal if the spray was not $13 a can.
5,Works great for my trouble-maker cats,"My cats get into everything including the trash, the sink, and even food cooking on the stove. I had pretty much given up trying to get them to stop until I found this product. I works great and now my cats are afraid of the counters. You do have to keep it up though. I sometimes turn the product off when I use the sink and forget to turn it back on. I think my cats have realized that sometimes I leave it off on accident and try to get up on the counters. They run when the air and the sound goes off though. :)"
3,"Not great, but works ok.","Works as advertised, but the range of detection is less than 5 feet. Also the propellant is a refrigerant. I have not done the research on it but I would guess its not something you would want to inhale. I am very health conscious and I try to pass those values onto my pets. I don't want to breath that stuff and I would assume if my cat had a choice he would not want to either."
3,Works Good - When They Work,"These things work really well for my six cats - when they work. I've bought eight of them but three of them did not work when I got them. Trying to return the non-functioning ones is a pain. You have to go to the ConTech website and either call them or email them for a ""RMA Number and Special Instructions"". They are slow to reply to email. I haven't tried calling yet. I'd give them five stars if their quality control was better. They also seem to be slow shipping them and although they say ""Prime"" there is no way to speed up shipping over the usual snails pace."
3,Too Loud,"Purchased: April 2008Pro: Easy to put together and set up.Con: Scared the cats so much they went into hiding. Rather than keep them away from a particular location they were too frightened to come out from under the bed - 2 floors up.Overall: It does what it says and, for our cats, way too much more. We decided not to continue using it - so wasted $$. You may have a different experience with your cats - this was ours."
1,Does not work.,"I purchased this item to try to keep the neighborhood cats from attacking the birds at the bird feeder in my yard. It does not work as advertized; in fact, it does not work at all. Save your money...."
1,NOT compressed air !!!,"This is advertised as containing compressed air. It does not. It comes with a can of 1,1,1,2 Tetrafluoroethane. This item cannot be returned."
3,CONTECH STAY AWAY MOTION ACTIVATED PET DETERRANT,SO FAR THE CONTECH PET DETERRANT FROM AMAZON IS WORKING FINE. I TURNED IT TO ALARM ONLY FOR NOW.
5,Works,"I've been using this product for two weeks now. Main objective was keeping my cat off the kitchen table. This was pretty hard, as she is quite fearless and was used to having her way anywhere in the house. The table is now totally cat free. I also used it to keep her away from a specific room by placing it at the door; she now barely comes near it. Purchased two more which are on their way to me.Btw, Aluminium foil does a pretty good job as well keeping her off the kitchen counter."
2,"Great, until they get used to it...","This made my cat run full-speed away the first few times he set it off. Then it gradually became a game. He would creep up to it slowly; I swear he was seeing how close he could get before he set it off. Then it no longer bothered him a bit and would walk right up to it and get into whatever it was supposed to be deterring him from. Now it can sit there beeping and hissing all it wants and he totally ignores it. I guess my cat is just too smart. Scat Mat (ScatMat 48-by-20-Inch Electronic Pet Training Mat, Large) works much better (and no, it's not inhumane - the shock is SO mild it doesn't even hurt)!"
3,Works GREAT until it dies after a few months,"I've had three of these, and as everyone has noted, they truly frighten the cat away from off-limits areas. However, the sensor is unreliable, and all three died after just a few months--well before the canister of gas was even empty. Fortunately, the cat was so traumatized that she still stayed away from forbidden areas for more than a year. But now she's forgotten, so guess I'll get another one. I kept the old canisters to use as ""scarecrows""--once in a while, I switch them out with the working one."
4,"deters well, doesn't always activate properly","I got this to keep my kittens away from the front door so they wouldn't try to dart out when I come and go. It works pretty well, and has done the job. The cats definitely don't like it, and have learned to avoid it. It's a little hard to tell where it can ""see"" though. Sometimes one of my cats walks right up to it and it doesn't go off. Other times, it sees one of them several meters away and goes off for no reason. It also goes off if I open the oven door, since it's infra-red activated. I've also used it to keep them off counters. A little annoying when I forget it's on and set it off myself, but that's not really the device's fault.I would recommend this product to cat owners who need to keep their cats away from counters, doors, cables, etc."
1,"Defective motion sensor, AMAZON WILL NOT PERMIT RETURN!!!","I buy a lot from Amazon, but this once they really pulled one over on me. While this device works well in theory, unfortunately once it's triggered and the alarm sounds and compressed air sprays, ours continues to go off until you turn the unit off and then back on again to reset the switch. It's extremely frustrating and an issue that happened the first time we used it. Alas, Amazon says that this is a ""hazardous material"" due to the compressed air so even though ours was defective right out of the gate, we're SOL. Thanks Amazon..."
5,The kitchen counters are MINE again!,"My cats absolutely loved to get on my kitchen counters and drink from any dish I had in the sink. I tried everything: Double-sided duct tape, aluminum foil, shaking cans, and water guns. Nothing worked. Then I decided to give this thing a go. Well let me tell you, this device got the job done. After just a couple of air sprays, the sound alone scared them off. Now they won't go on my counters at all if the spray can is there, even if the thing is turned completely off!Note: The sensor is quite sensitive. It's been known to pick up movement a good 10 or even 15 away. As a result, I recommend placing it on the *front* of the counter and aimed toward the back. (Don't forget to pick it up when startled kitty knocks it over. ;))"
2,"Sometimes works, sometimes not so much.","I got this to keep the cats out of the bedroom. The good is that it has both an alarm and spray. You can choose between alarm only or alarm and spray. The bad is that it only works sometimes, which has one of my cats still trying to get into the bedroom. I've tried changing the batteries to lithium and the sensor still only works intermittedly. At night I've tried leaving the light on in the hallway, which means I still have to close the door which defeats the purpose. If the sensor was able to detect the cat's on a more consistent basis, I would highly recommend this product. As it only works sometimes it hasn't done much to keep the cats out."
4,Glitchy but so far its doing what its suppose to.,"We have a canary and we got a kitten thinking that she will get used to the bird and they can live in harmony. Boy was I wrong. The cat spends half the day trying to torture the poor bird. She even managed to bring the whole cage down, I was certain she killed the bird that night. I tried everything! Placing foil around the cage, orange essence, tape.. squirting water, getting highend squirters, shaking can full of coins. While some things would work, like squirting water but unless I plan to stay near the cage day and night, she would jump right back up there. So as our final straw we purchased this device. So far sometimes it read us walking by and goes off, other times we can do a whole dance in front of it and nothing. But the two times our cat tried getting in the room, it went off and she ran in complete fear. Now it appears she is avoiding the room. I've only had the decide for a few hours...so lets see how it goes but we are hopeful!"
2,Motion detector is FAR too sensitive,"I have tried every single setting on this device, and it still detects motion at a distance of 10 feet away. I can move my foot to get comfortable in my chair and it will go off. I am sure that it will keep my cat off the counter, but it's also going to run out of air in a week at this rate."
1,Challenging,"Product DOES work, but I'm not sure at what range or angles. Also, one can select sound and air blast, or just sound, but not just air blast. The sound has taught my cats to jump every time my oven beeps, or my tablet beeps, or when the microwave goes off. If I had been ware there are similar products out there that offer just the puff of air, I would not have bought this one."
4,Really works,Bought this to keep our cat out of the bedroom. Works perfectly-as soon as he hears the sound he runs away
3,AIR CANISTER REFILLS ARE EXPENSIVE MAKES THIS FAIR BUY,AIR CANISTER REFILLS ARE EXPENSIVE MAKES THIS A FAIR BUY.. THIS WOULD BE A GREAT PRODUCT IF THEY HAD REFILLABLE AIR CANISTERS LIKE THEY USE IN PAINTBALL. BIG WASTE OF RESOURCES BUYING THESE REFILL CANS. SO FAR I HAVEN'T USED THIS AFTER THE ORIGINAL AIR RAN OUTIT WORKS WELL. IT WILL SCARE THE HELL OUT OF YOUR CAT
1,Waste of money,"This product did nothing to deter my mom's 7 month old kitten from jumping on the counters. He actually went up to the unit and smacked it with his paws until he knocked it off the counter.... An expensive & useless item. Also wasted 1/2 of the can of air trying to get the lid on it, the sound it makes wouldn't scare anything or deter it... Total & absolute waste all the way around. I would not recommend this product!!!"
3,Works OK in bright areas,"I bought this because our cats keep going into the back corner of the hallway to ""do their business."" I'm guessing the previous owners had a cat that used to either have its litter box there or would just do its business in that spot.I bought one of these to test and works great when the lights are on and its bright in the hallway. The problem is at night it is useless. We bought two fairly bright night lights to put in the hallway, even had to install an electric outlet but works maybe 1 out of every 3 times. Just caught our one cat back there last night and alarm never went off while she went right past it or left. The unit is on the floor pointing straight ahead so the cat has to walk right in front of it.Going to try to install a motion sensor attached to a bright light to see if that will help, otherwise this unit and the cats will be finding a new home ;)"
2,Not worth it.,"I bought one of these to put on my covered porch to keep the chickens off of it. I've been messing with it for the past hour trying to figure out the right spot that will make it work.It works less the 50% of the time for me and the chickens. It worked fine when I turned it on and tested it with my hand. The chickens must have some special avian cloaking device that we have yet to discover because they can pretty much peck at the light sensor and it won't go off.I then go out there and walk in front of it to see if it will go off for me. Sometimes it does, most times it dosn't.I've messed with the height of it to see if that would help(put in on top of a over turned bucket). It didn't.If you're ok with it working half the time then this item is for you. For me, it's not worth the price I paid."
5,Love it...,"I was super cautious because there were other 'poor' reviews, but I am so glad I decided to try it out anyway. My beeper alarm and the spray work fine. The cat only had to be scared by it like twice. The batteries do die pretty fast if it is being abused. The sensor is less effective when you first put it down, give it a few minutes to realize what it has to cover and then it works fine. I have a friend that is a small animal vet and I gave her all the info to share with any clients that are at thier wits end."
4,I am pleased; my two cats are not!,"I purchased 2 sprayers to use on my kitchen counter-top and dining room rug. I have used them for a few days now, and my cats are afraid of them! They stay away from the areas where they have been placed. Over the last few weeks, one of my cats has been pooing on the rug every few days. This is unusual behavior for my cat. I originally found a similar product at a national chain pet store, but found this product online at a better price. So far, the Stay Away sprayer seems to work!"
4,Work really well!,"This product works really well especially with the alarm and the air combination. My cat seems to get used to the alarm, but she hates when the air sprays out. My fiance is afraid that she might get used to the air as well, so he wants us to get the Stay Away mat.Overall, I would recommend this product."
2,"Inconsistent, not accurate","It's better at catching humans than cats! Even then, it's only 60-70% accurate. You'll put it in a doorway or on a table, and it'll go off if you walk past it slowly. Works best when the animal walks up and sniffs it.If the device uses an infrared sensor, their sampling rate is too low or the threshold too high. I doubt they used ultrasound."
1,DEFECTIVE,"This product never worked. The alarm portion worked, but does not deliver the puff of air. Very upset due to the inability to return it...$40.00 down the drain..."
2,Not so away,"The conway stay away cat deterrent does not consistently fulfill its claim. Maybe the sensor on the detector is not working properly, but my cats can sometimes walk right by it and it does not go off. Also, I have one cat who has figured out that he can walk in front of the can but close to the opposite side of the door frame and the detector will not detect him; he then walks into the room. Another of my cats trots by it without detection. It sometimes goes off when there is nothing around it. Sometimes it doesn't pick up anything no matter how much one waves a hand or leg in front of it. The detector should definitely be redesigned."
1,do not buy!,"This item was terrible. It went between going off all the time on it's own with nothing in the room to when you wave your hand in front of it, it not responding at all. Also the sound is not very loud and would not deter any animal. Not worth anything! Also- cannot ship it back because it is considered ""hazardous material"" so you can't even get your money back."
1,"purchased 12, 4 do not work",I purchased 12 contech stayaway's. 3 do not stop beeping and keep spraying. 1 does not spray.YOU CANNOT RETURN THESE. DON'T BUY FROM AMAZON!!!!!
1,Buyer Beware,"I received a defective unit and it is not returnable despite the so-called warranty. Amazon will not accept this a return nor will the manufacturer. I emailed them and got the run-around. Waste of money. The motion detector will not work, you can wave your hand in front if it all around and nothing happens. It will beep when you first turn it on but that's it. I bought this to keep Kitty away from a plant. No such luck.Buyer Beware, you might get stuck with a defect like I did."
1,"WARNING, NO RETURNS ALLOWED","I didn't know this item was classified as hazardous/flammable and couldn't be returned. After all, why would a spray that is advertised as safe for pets be classified as hazardous/flammable? (Plus, it is incredibly disheartening that it is considered hazardous/flammable when it emits a spray that easily reaches your pets). Besides the fact that a customer wouldn't suspect it of being classified as hazardous/flammable, there was no warning on the product information page that it was not returnable. I would never have bought it if I knew there was no way I could return it."
1,Doesn't work with fast cats!,"I bought this product specifically to attempt to keep our cats from slithering out the door behind us. Because it has a non-sensitive photocell and there is a slight delay in the spray/sound, this product is worthless for a cat that moves quickly."
1,Warning - NO RETURNS!,"I received this product and the head unit would sound an audible alarm, but the sprayer didn't work. I called the manufacturer and they quickly replaced it. The second unit worked, somewhat, but very poorly. Any cat with any sense can deal with this and laugh at you. Don't waste your money. Then when I tried to return it, I find out that it is supposedly hazardous materials and can't be returned!Nowhere did I see that it wasn't returnable before I bought it. Anyway, I am not done with this, I don't take no for an answer without a fight.However, I highly recommend you DON'T buy this product!Your choice, you have been warned..."
2,Won't work well with deaf cats,"I thought this would be a good option to train our deaf cat to stay off the counter or other places. It actually worked well with our hearing cat, but not at all with our deaf one. The problem is the unit beeps first and the air blast is delayed. It's ment to condition the cat so that ater you can just use the beep setting. Since our cat can't hear the beep is useless, and the air blast doesn't come until after the cat is past the unit and out of range of tha air blast.If it has an air only mode that triggered right away, it would probably work, but as is it's useless for a deaf cat."
3,Worked great for 6 months,"I've had the StayAway for about 6 months now. For the first 4 months I could not have been happier with its performance. While there was a slight delay between motion detection and the sound, it was quick enough to train my cats very quickly. Unfortunately, about 2 months ago it stopped working for no reason. We've tried new batteries and an air canister, but the only time it makes a sound now is when we turn it on or off. I'm disappointed that it stopped working so quickly and have contacted customer service."
5,Works like a charm!,This product is great. Keeps my cat away from my furniture like a charm. Definitely recommend.
4,Wish I had tried these years ago.,"These things are great! They have effectively kept our 3 cats off our Oriental rug. A little pricey, but cheaper and more humane than shock collars. Just be sure to buy enough of them to cover the area you want to protect, as the sensor only sees what is directly in front of it and it only has a range of about 3-5 ft."
4,Earns its name!,"We bought this to keep our cats off the kitchen counter. I was unsure how this would work, as we have an ""open"" kitchen, so the possibilities for catching us rather than the cats was very high. Nonetheless, we set it up, and watched. Our youngest cat hit the floor and scrabbled around the corner as fast as she could! Our more laid back, older one, simply jumped down. It only took a week or so, and switching it back and forth between counters-they have learned not to go there. It is so nice not to have to worry about food left on the counter... Kudos to Contech for a great product!"
3,Works Intermittently,"Sometimes the sensor will detect movement and sometimes it won't. It's very hit or miss. Fortunately, my cat only needed a couple of encounters with StayAway to keep her from pooping on the rug. She's been using the litter box again for a whole week with no problems."
1,This is not bluegrass or even close.,I have a bunch of John's recordings and this totaly different. It's nothing like Mark Twang or the Aeroplane album. It was more coffee house music. I was disappointed.
3,who is this guy?,"John Hartford doesn't seem to be able to decide whether he is a banjo player or a singer or a composer. but he is one of the few who can play the banjo and sing at the same time (unless that's some trick of the recording). ""Gentle on my mind"" is major; the rest of it is a mixed bag."
1,"Not worth the money, smells yucky","I was told that this was a wonderful product because of the ways that it does not need a filter, nor do you have to add humidifier bacteriostat liquids. My air-o-swiss began to have a nasty odor after 6 days of continuous use. Since I have heard such great things about this brand, I am somewhat inclined to think I had a 'dud' seeing that when I returned it the employees told me they have ""very few problems"". So buy it from a reputable store so that you may return it if you encounter any problems, as I did. Good luck to you"
4,good but slow,"Hi folks,I read about this camera that It's a very good camera, but it's fairly slow to record the picture? Somebody have comments on this..And what's about the rafale mode?cheers."
3,Don't use the screws that came with it.,"I would like to find something better, and would pay more, but there probably is not a market for that other than just a couple of us here. It's a bit shaky when you are buffing, but as long as you have mounted it correctly, you can get a good shine by having a long buffing cloth.Unless you are screwing into a solid wood post, the screws are not good. They are too short to get to studs through anything at all. You will need a sturdy spot, and longer screws to reach the studs. It wouldn't hurt to include longer screws and better mounting instructions. I would be happy to write them for the company.All in all, it's what it has been for years. But not that many people polish their shoes any more, look around."
1,Great Old Idea But Too Flimsy,"I had one of these as a youngster and kept the family shoes in tip top shape. This product, although a reasonable copy, is far too flimsy to allow an adequate amount of pressure with the shine cloth. It wobbles all over the place and will not support the shoe steady enough to allow you to work the brush or shine cloth. A waste of money!"
3,Hard to say...,"Just got married and moved into our first apartment. The unit we have is the T10-1143. The only complaint we have was something happened that wouldnt let the fan run on auto...instead it stayed on ALL THE TIME, unless the heat was turned off. It cost us about $90 in elevated power bills before we realized what was happening and had it fixed.Not sure how it compares to a digital unit, but would be very interested to find out."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"Drug Related will have U biting your nails and pulling your hair. I am very impressed with Mr. Glenn's writing abilities. He will have U staying up late nights trying to figure out what will happen next. His characters are all unique and very complex, which keeps U wanting more. Make sure U check out MOB.."
1,Waste of time and money,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is little more than a 97 page infomercial for the author's $95 makeup kit. The step by step instructions are in black and white, leaving the reader to guess exactly what color he means by ""amaretto"" or ""brown suede"". (Unless, of course, you buy the $95 kit.) Most of the ""37 Secrets"" revealed in this book are either standard makeup application tecniques or common sense items that I believe most women already know."
4,Pleasurable reading material.,Great easy to follow instructions. Teaches women how to coordinate their clothes to bring out the beauty in the color of their eyes. It has great helpful tips on make up application and how to choose the right clothes combinations. I thought it was fun to read and very helpful
3,Airline Adaptor for air shocks and struts.,"Works great. The only negative is that the nut that secures the schrader valve to the mounting surface has a very poor zinc plating that corroded away within 4 months of use in a winter environment. Lets make the nut out of stainless steel (310 or 316), UV resistant Nylon, or Aluminum. Now I have to find out what thread is on the outside of a Schrader valve and source a nut with that thread, something done a whole lot easier at the manufacturer level."
4,Monroe Air Shock kit,"This order came is fairly fast. It was what I ordered, great condition- new. Everything is good."
1,Fraud,"No such book was ever written by Wyatt. The ""book"" mentions this on page one. Do not fall for what is in essence someone taking advantage of a ficticious scene of in a movie."
3,Wrong title,"This is not the actual book written by Earp. He wrote a short story entitled ""the life and times of Doc Holiday."" I read a copy in the early 80s for school but haven't seen a copy for a long time. I have not been looking either."
4,"Only con, it is not easily washed off of skin and clothes.","Fun for my kids but I would recommend ages 4 or older, my 2 yo kept putting her hands on the ink and it was really hard to wash off of skin and clothes."
2,not so rich,I find that these stamp pads are not so rich in color or very enticing. I had hoped for more.
5,Great stuff!,"My hair is straight but tends to be fly away at times. This product smooths my hair giving it a sleek, straight look. I love it!"
5,Inspiring prospective of the Promised land,"""Inspiring and written in a simple and entertaining language. The main idea is presenting a deeper definition and prospective for the ""Promised Land."" It is answering the questions: What does the Promised Land really mean? What is your promised land and how to inherit it? I found in this book an inspiring review of how people in the bible perceived the Promised Land and how we reacted to God's call. The book is written in an easy to read language and will help you see a new dimension of some of the bible stories and character."""
2,Audigy 2 is better,"First, be forewarned that this soundcard/external box system requires an extra power connection inside your computer. If you do not have a spare power connection, then the external box is useless--and that means no MIDI connections (no keyboard), no mike, etc. etc.Second, the card itself. Uses a 32-bit audio engine. It is widely believed that the more bits, the better. However, some sources say that the bits above 16 are mainly noise, with some increased definition. At any rate, recording or playing soundfonts with this soundcard produces very harsh-sounding instruments. This may be what you want if you're writing rock music. If you're writing chamber music, choose a different card."
1,The product is great --- not the seller BIGFLYSPORTS,Received the wrong size and need this item asap. What an inconvenience! Amazon is great. Refunded my account for this item.
2,Eh.,"The WarmFX Formula is like a mixture of Bengay and Body Glide. The body parts I use glide on, such as under my arms and around my neck, are not areas I would put bengay on. For the brief period I used the WarmFX formula it seemed to provide similar anti-chaffing effects."
4,Only 4 stars to be nice.,"WWell, i waited anxiously for the coolmax psu to arrive, only to find that there was only one SATA rail plugin for the hard drive, and on my ATX case, the SATA cable was just too short to reach my HDD. Be careful, and i suggest you don't overlook the value of a Good psu for your pc that u love."
4,Great price - Good Power Supply,"This model power supply is the original PWS that was installed in a medium tower PC I built about 10 years ago. The supply finally gave up the ghost and I needed to get a replacement. I was surprised to find the exact model still for sale. I read the reviews which ranged from 1 to 5 stars and decided to purchase. Upon receipt I tested the PWS by connecting, on the 20 pin plug, the green (-PowerOn) to black (gnd) and then tested the voltages of each of the outputs. (You can find what these voltages are supposed to be by searching the Internet for ""ATX power supply voltages."") All the voltages were close to the nominal voltages so I installed the PWS. If this supply lasts 10 years it means it will outlive the life of the computer it's in. Very happy so far. I gave it 4 stars since the PWS is kind of limited on the number of connectors. For my use it was not a problem, but check the specifications before purchasing for your use."
3,Product Description should mention that this is an ATX v2.0 power supply.,"Replacing a blown power supply on an older computer, only to discover that this item's 24-pin motherboard connector is incompatible with my 20-pin ATX 1.x motherboard... 5 days wasted waiting for it to arrive. I rated it '3 stars' because there's no way to rate it 'can't use the product'."
5,PUSH WAS INTENSE,"This book was so intense that at times I had to put it down. It actually had my heart going pitter patter.Relentless gives us a fictionalized story with well researched facts.One reference I will give you from the book but then you have to buy your own. Relentess refers to the now Harlem as the Disney world of the ghetto. Just having shopped there last month this author is on target. There are plenty of other well researched topics as well.This book read like a movie it was just phenomenol. If you like my alltime favorite author Gloria Mallette, Then you will love Relentess. He has this way with his storyline that leaves you not wanting to pick up another book right away. Because you want to still remain on his ride. This was a wonderful book that was well written. I didn't catch any errors. Beautiful Job!!!!!!!! I know there better be a PUSH2 Because I am waiting............."
3,Over Rated,"After reading all the rave reviews I was drooling to read this much over rated novel. I was very disappointed at the countless descriptions the author felt the need to devulged to introduce each and every character. Asondra was as stupid as they come! Willing to do and ignore any and everything her man commands just for a quick buck. Push was the sterotypical jail bird! He spent the best years of his life behind bars which resulted in him being hardened, emotionless, and thinking he could out smart his PO. This makes me think, do they ever learn? Can they live the straight and narrow? Can they benefit society? Sara, was a ucking fay trip! A white woman using this type of language towards a black man is totally unacceptable! She would've been killed with the first racial remark she felt the need to let loosely slip her lips. Overall, Relentless did a good job taking the novel full circle but was surely in my opinion overly descriptive. Although, sex scenes can never be too descriptive :-)"
4,Push Relentless Aaron a quick read.,"I finished this book in just a few days, finding it a very easy read. Reality just jumps off the pages. Very hard to believe,however, we have to take it as it is in this world.Will read the follow up."
4,Love this book. Its one of my favorites,"I love this book. It has lots of creative ideas. Each section gives you a type of shower with preparation ideas (including pictures), invitation, menu, decoration, activities and even type of favors. It makes it easier for you to do. I used one for a baby shower ideas just a month ago it was a big hit, I just added a few more things to it and BAM the perfect shower that was fun and colorful. I have recomended this book to my friend and will like to recommend it to you too."
1,Great title but very poor content!,"The book has a great title, but the content is poor!!It deals with generality and lacks depth and with no data to backup statements made. Worse of all, when I check the existence of ""Innovation Trust"", one of the author claims to be the first bank to manage intellectual assets, in which he serves as CEO.As it turns out, the ""bank"" does not exist, I only find ""Circle Trust Company"", a trust company which offer 401K mutual fund, self-directed brokerage opinion, and custody and trust services. According to Connecticut state report it has assets of $3.45 millions. No information talks about intangible/patnet assets with Circle Trust and the billions of IP assets. What a disappointment!"
1,Hogwash!,"The biggest load of hogwash I have ever read! This book is virtually devoid of the very title that it claims to be analyzing - ideas. Borrows shamefully from every little management cliche that every high-school grader already knows about, talks about ideas and spins them into stories that only PR spin-masters can appreciate, this is a book meant for the trash - the one original idea left"
1,Worst Book Ever,I have never read such a horrible book in my entire life. The main character is terrible. Craig Morgenstern is a disgrace to all literature. It is the worst developed character in a goosebumps book ever...this book is easily a mockery to anyone who calls themselves an author.
5,Truly a Classic,"I have nearly 60 Nana Mouskouri CDs in around 10 languages, but I must say that this new release has left me astounded! To have recorded such a credible album at this point in her career will assure old and new fans that Nana Mouskouri is still in top form and should stay that way for some time. On Classic, an album of mostly arias and sacred works, Mouskouri gracefully makes the transition through Greek, French, German, Italian, English, Latin and Spanish all on the same album. Usually her albums are in the same language and marketed to the corresponding countries. Classic is a refreshing change from that. Not that I can think of any significant weak points in Mouskouri's career, but this album should remain as a highlight. (Although I would compare it favorably to the recent Concert For Peace.)"
2,Questionable Quality Control,"My last Panasonic cordless gave me 5 years of excellent service. I recently purchased this 3-handset unit. However, while I am pleased with their functionality and sound, I found that one of the units functions intermittantly. It will connect a call when picked up, but 50% of the time the microphone and ear-speaker won't work. I've already disgarded the box, so I guess I'm stuck with it."
5,HOT HOT HOT!!!!!,"You can't beat this album if you just wanna get down! This melodic (yet out of tune) Hot (but goes down smooth after 6 or 8 caipirinhas) album is king o' the hill baby! Se voce quiser disfrutar da melhor musica brasiliera deste seculo, nao busca mais. Voce ja achou em Claudinho & Bucheca! Buy this album. It is off the chain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,not enough !,"I understand exchange is a huge application but this book try to cover all the aspect but is does not give enough information,I found this book almost ""inutile"" when trying to solve my problem with rcp over httpdo not buy !!"
2,Not Enough Technical Details,This book lacks technical details. This book talks too much about planning and management.I would rather have a book with more step by step instructions on how to accomplish different tasks. This book talks more what Exchange can do and less on how to do it.
1,A thick Exchange 2003 Brochure,"Trust me. I went through many Exchange server books and I am an experienced system admin and Exchange admin. This book is the worst book for technical people. The concept in the book is for readers who are most likely a non-technical managers who want to have an overall knowledge about Exchange. If you touch Exchange server, do not read this book and waste your time. Go with Exchange 24/7 which is much better."
2,Don't waste your time and money,"I bought this book because others rated it so high. It was a great disapointment. Microsoft's 70-284 training kit had a more in-depth coverage of Exchange 2003, even though it is basically a copy&paste of technet articles, than Unleashed. I found Microsoft's course 2009 material to be the best source of information on Exchange 2003. It is definetely the most complete out of the three. I was surprised!Well, my advice is if you want to go out and buy a book, don't get this one, get Microsoft's training kit. If you want to learn Exchange 2003, take course 2400 or 2009, they'll give you a better return on your time spent.FCMCSE 2003,2000,4.0 MCSA Linux+ CCNA"
4,Great Book,Exactly what I needed. Great book. This is not for your average user. I will keep buying this line of product.
1,Superior to Float Pumps,"Vastly superior to Float Pumps. High reliability. Works well with the Rule 98A Shower Kit found on most Sea Ray boats. Just cut out the Rule Switch, splice in using waterproof butt connectors, and screw down where the old switch was installed. Pay careful attention to UltimaSwitch wiring instructions.===>>> UPDATE: The switch completely failed after 1 month of very light use. Just fresh water. Not happy. I thought it would be reliable. I don't know if I just got a defective unit or if this is indicative of the product."
4,Informative,Very sensitively aware production... The interview style of the film successfully narrates the intimacy of a few queer middle eastern individuals in diaspora...
4,Great Rare Gem,"Personally, I loved this album and recommend it to anyone looking for a great rare Marley album. The sound, however, isn't perfect, though still quite good. I would, however, not recommend this for the casual Marley fan, but rather, the diehard audience."
3,Global Bible Commentary,"This collection is entirely focused on neo-Marxist, anti-American, anti-Israel, and anti-global economy nonsense misnamed as ""biblical theology."" The much too generous salaries and perks of these seminary professors come from countless church folks totally unaware of what these so-called mentors of future church leaders express. How many of these seminary folks have EVER run a business or coroporation, been involved long term in labor unions,political parties or in governmental projects outside of the academy. I patiently read through this book and found so shallow as not tot be workth much creditibility at all. The kind of bitterness sown by these authors is absolutely foreign to the sovereign God who judges all. A much better resources is The African Bible Commentary, edited by Tokunboh Adeyemo. This work combines true exegesis with hard-hitting social justice reflections."
4,Global Bible Commentary,I got the item very soon after placing my order. And the item is in very good condition although it is from the used item list.
5,Cutest Charm,"Bought this for my stepdaughter who is into scuba diving ""big time""!! She just loves it!!"
2,Interesting setting. Dragging plot.,"A Woman is murdered in the early 20th century of Vienna. There is no bullet found and the door of the room where the murder takes place is locked from the inside. Dr. Lieberman is called by his detective friend to help solve the case. I thought the setting was interesting. I liked the references to Sigmund Freud. The mystery did not grab my attention, however. I thought there were too many mini-plots that were really not pertinent to the story. I wondered if they were intentional to make the book longer. The resolution was weak. There wasn't enough of a surprise at the end. Disappointing and not highly recommended."
3,So-so,"It was a decent read, but I wasn't jumping up and down with excitement at any point in the book except in the first 50 pages. I thought that the characters were not fleshed out in as much detail as a book of this kind warranted, and the Sherlock Holmes type deductions made by the protagonist based on Freudian theory seemed outlandish. Good for a quick read on a flight, but forgettable."
3,Do Your Research,"This is not a bad yarn, but its main attraction for those who know Vienna is simply Tallis's sense of place. He skilfully weaves in elements of early 20th-century history, but the overall effect is somewhat spoiled by his sloppy orthography: far too many of the German words (place names, small talk, etc.) in this book are misspelled."
5,"Good price, very good quality.",A great replacement blade for my old lawn mower. It was cheaper than buying it from Lawn boy. Very good quality.
1,"Does not fit ALL 21"" Lawnboys.","I believe this fits older models, but not current 4 cycle models. Costs too much to return."
5,Pure emotion,"I don't buy many CD's. I'm picky about what artist's CDs I'll plunk down my hard earned money for. I do most of my listening on my way to work. I've found I'm sorry I don't have a longer commute, I'm enjoying this CD so much. I recently bought Brad Paisley's latest (enjoy it too!) and boy, what a contrast, but it's kinda fun to jump back and forth between the light and happy Brad and dark, sad Gary. Gary's pain is evident, and I appreciate that he chose to share it with us. Great CD, I'm glad I spent the money!"
5,Fantastic!!!!,I love this CD!!! I think it's one of Gary's best so far. It really helps you understand (a very small amount) what he must have gone through this past year. Gary is usually a very private person so it must have been difficult for him to put himself out there so much. He has a fabulous voice and he really shows it on this CD. If you like country music this should be your very next CD.
3,Ok Cd,Im a fan of Gary but this cd just wasnt worth the money. Im just not into the majority of songs on this cd. If i could do it over I would find a web site where I could purchase songs individually. Other than that I received it rather fast and it was in great condition and a decent price.
3,Vertical Horizon Should Feel Ashamed,"I am sorry that this is basically a CD that showcases his misery after his wife's suicide, and I am sincere when I say that I am truly sorry that his wife killed herself, and I am sorry that I am going to tell you that I dislike this disc. However, that aside, his version of Vertical Horizon's ""THE BEST I EVER HAD"", is absolute torture. VH should be ashamed that they allowed their record company to allow this terrible rendition to be made, or they should be ashamed of themselves for personally giving the go-ahead. IT IS HORRIBLE. They do such a better job on this song. I mean, it is one of my FAVORITE SONGS!!!!! Ok, now that I got that out of they way........ I can now say that THE BEST I EVER HAD was the only reason I gave this CD 2-stars. The rest of the CD?.........pure, lovely-depression, sadness, and dark themes. Great stuff! The VH re-make? Trash."
1,ripoff,"Hey, look at me, I'm Gary Allen and just like all other pop-country, I rip off pop hits that no one who listens to pop-country will know because we're so close-minded...oh, what's that, a Vertical Horizon song from like, literally a few years ago? What's that, I can record it EXACTLY the same way and everyone will think it's my untalented self? Wow, great, here you go America."
4,Tough All Over much better than Use Heart for Sale,The songs were better and the music went in a different direction. The material on this CD was just better.
5,One of my all time favorites!!!,"Gary Allan has done a phenomenal job on this album. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would! You can hear and feel the emotion behind every song. Some of the songs might even evoke a few tears. His voice is amazing, and the scratchiness in it only adds to his appeal. If you ever get the chance to see him in person as I did this summer, do it. You will not regret it!"
5,A lesson in the truth of music,"Gary Allan was gifted with a raw uniqueness to his sound that has never been more obvious than with this cd. While Gary could have easily ""called it in"" for Tough All Over while dealing with his wifes death, he didnt. Music should represent life and Gary let that happen. I was moved to tears through much of the cd. He allowed the listener into the emotions he is dealing with instead attempting to heal behind closed doors. The rest of the music world could learn a lesson from Gary Allan. He understands and appreciates the power of music."
5,Excellent work,"I do agree with the ones that clame that Cazuza was a genious and that Cazuza&Barao Vermelho together, composed songs that will remain among the best of the brazilian music for many and many more decades. But the thing is that, even after Cazuza left the band, it was still clear the brilliance of the compositions and versions made by Barao Vermelho over the past two decades. This band, specially Frejat, was very important in giving life to Cazuza's lyrics. In this work they again were able to show their talent, by going through the different moments of their careers and of course, through the compositions of Cazuza as well, always with the same musicality and sensibility! Cheers"
4,michigan climbing,"AH, i so miss Utah, CO, and Alaksa... now my climbing days are on my roof and anchor systems for roof repairs and such. But a whole new thrill when your brother with no climbing experience and a 5 minute instruction on safety promptly removes his belay rope hand!!! Black diamond is great and functions as expected"
2,average or below,"Yes, this book tries to cover everything in military history, but it abounds in slips and errors. For example, its authors write that 'hungarians are related racially and linguisticaly to both Finns and Turks' ( that's a strange hybrid, indeed ); 'Khazars were Turks and probably descendent from Huns' ( nobody knows for sure who were Huns, but certainly not Turks ) and so on.Thus, in my opinion, this book is rather mediocre, and hardly can be called a serious and impartial historical reference."
5,a taste of the musical diversity and richness of benin,Denagan Janvier Honfo captures the richness of Beninese drumrhythyms found among different peoples and languages....every region has its particular rhythym and he brings out their uniqueness in a fabulous way. I spent four years in Benin and consider this CD a wonderful representation of the traditional drum music of Benin.
1,Get something else,"I bought some fairly generic Cat6 RJ-45 keystone jacks along with these (different brand). Modifications to the box (with pliers and and tin-snips) were required to make it work for my jacks. They never snapped in properly, before or after modification. Maybe it only works with it's own brand? Standards for the win."
5,Superb,"This CD is excellent. It is diverse. The Csarda is played by lara St. John, and she's phenomenal. Track 14 is a Chinese piece that uses the erhu. There are also great classical pieces, and fun fiddle tunes, all played superbly.This CD is a must."
2,Not what I expected...,"Thought this was goling to be another awesome action filled movie. But, had me dozing off the first 20 mins."
2,a bit tedious,There is an art to making a language learning course interesting and engaging. The art was lost on this course although it still does a decent job of teaching with lots of repetition.
1,Bad for beginners,"I'm preparing for my trip back to Japan, and thought these tapes would help me remember what I was fluent in as a child, so I skipped the first edition.I listened to level 2 tapes a few times, and after not recognizing the words they were saying, and then realizing they were using phrases I'd never use, for example ""i am not your friend"", I figured out I bought the wrong tapes.The phrases are said in English first, and then in Japanese, but the Japanese is so fast that you don't have a chance to mimic the sentence, and if you do, you don't know how to break down the meaning of each part of the sentence. Maybe I should have bought level 1, but I really don't think I need to learn how to say things they were trying to teach.I bought the 1993 version of Henry N. Raymond's cassettes, but I'm not sure the current version is any different!I've since found a great book for beginners called Japanese in 10 Minutes a Day. It is easy to learn, fun, and really does take 10 minutes a day!"
1,dangerous,These things are dangerous. the are unstable and will tip over in a heartbeat. I would never buy these again and would advise others not to buy.
1,Not the hit versions from the radio.,"These are new recordings of the old hits. Yes, Holly and Janie sing them, but it's not the same. Amazon should make notes about products like this, informing customers that they are re-recordings of the hits. I was under the impression that these were the original recordings, which is the only reason I ordered the CD set. I feel cheated by amazon.com, so I felt that I should warn other fans, so you won't be surprised the way I was."
4,At a loss of words,"How could something so simplistic in theory be so amazing? This ""supergroup"" of sorts is tight and funky. They are not funky in that watered-down white boy way. They are funky in a Prince and the Revolution kind of way. They sound like Aurthur Lee and Prince's love child. On top of all this Neil Haggerty is an amazing gutair player (you already knew that). One of the top 5 albums to come out this year easily. To sum it up, tight+sexy+funk+dirtyrock'n'roll=classic material. For fans of laterday Royal Trux, Love, Funkadelic and the Rolling Stones' ""Aftermath."" Classic stuff. Buy it. Back to you Lavar (Buh-buh-bum)"
5,Fabulous!,"I love, love, love this! It is great quality definitely for the price and is very trendy! Great buy!"
1,Actually ZERO Stars!! What Happened?! Cringe!! Ouch!!,"Don't be fooled by the slick cover art, this record is by far the worst record SAGA has done. IT is very hard to listen to. An awful cover of ""Taxman"" gimme a break! A terrible re-recorded version of ""You're not Alone"" WHY!? Hideous German techno on ""Where's my Money."" Sloppy drumming on the title song-where'd Steve Negus go?! I would've left too! The best song here is ""Gonna Give it to Ya"" which is how the whole record should sound based on their direction up to this point. The rest sounds contrived and tired, however, ""Heaven can Wait"" and ""Welcome to the Zoo"" are ok. Overall, I can't believe this is the same band that relased gems such as ""Behaviour,"" ""World's Apart"" and ""Silent Knight"" I love SAGA and feel bad writing this review, but unfortunately, this is well deserved. Skip this and get their earlier remasters which are ESSENTIAL!!"
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly","First of all this cd suffers from bad production. Some of the songs on here are good, but like welcome to the zoo( on this cd) it comes off better live. The best song on here is gonna give to ya which is a really excellent song..the only one here well produced. Heaven can wait is very good but once again comes off better live. You were made for me is good but suffers from poor production. For example, take give my money..which is good musically but has really annoying voices shouting where's my money in it"
3,Worse than some better than most,"As a long time SAGA fan I was a little disappointed in this album. A few really great moments, and some weird choices in covers. ""Taxman"" Give me a break. All in all, this album grows on you, and has seen a lot of play at my house. Too bad we didn't get the original cover art. That was cool."
3,remastered but still one of sagas weakest,"OK, not the best saga album but it is remastered and has a bonus track live. however my version has the lyrics and this one doesn't, and they say all the remasters are restoring artwork. does this only work on the old albums?? Either way I like about half the album so 3 stars. generation 13 and full circle are better releases over the last few years. however they are remastering all of the catalog so dont miss the classics. and (they're not listed) as remastered so look for a 2002 release date."
2,"Recognize ""No Stranger ?""","I find it very strange that none of the reviewers mention the track that continues the old track ""no stranger ( chapter eight)"" of the WORLDS APART album. The titel-song ""pleasure and pain"" has the same melody as the beginning and end of the old song. Like the chapters, its a continuance...Although I must agree that the best song on the album are ""gonna give it to ya"", but I also like ""you`re not alone 97"" and the titel-song."
1,Fantastically Wrong Indeed...,This is without a doubt the worst Saga release ever pushed on the fans. a disgrace in every respect.
3,A disappointment,"While the writing is fine here, it is mostly about fishing and not so much about writing, and not very much at all about Nova himself. I was kinda hoping for more of a ""memoir."" I didn't get it. The truth is I suspect even anglers would be disappointed in this too brief book. While the style is quite personal, the content is not.I first 'discovered' Nova years ago when I read THE GOOD SON. Liked it so much I read a couple of his previous novels, including TURKEY HASH, which I also liked. So I was curious to learn more about the author. Unfortunately BROOK TROUT didn't give much away. Nope. Something of a disappointment.- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir BOOKLOVER"
1,Card slot cover broke 1st day.......,"The cover to the slot for the card broke the 1st day, very weak hinges and door is in an area that is most likely to get grabbed when using it."
3,I'm Satisfied,"I have been using this reader for over a year with no problems at all. I bought it because I needed an SDHC card reader and it has never failed me.I like the attached ""door"" so I don't loose it but I'm not crazy about the wine bottle design. It is too wide when I plug it into a front USB port... it extends into the space of the other USB slot and I can't use both slots at once. That's my only complaint."
1,Broke during first use,"Yes this bag looks very nice and the ad brags about durable handles, and yet I took it on vacation, used it to carry sunsceen and towels and in just 2 weeks use the handle came loose from the bag. Do not buy!"
5,American college jocks,"I luv American college jocks. Give me more and more. I luv seeing American college jocks on campus, then coming home and seeing them on the DVD. More More More..."
3,cupie doll mold,"wasn't overly happy with mold,arms and legs didn't match up ,throught the price of shipping was a little dear as item was plastic and didn't weigh muchbrought another 3D mold on different website much better results ,had 4 arm &leg; parts so they match up cheaper shipping costthey both come from overseas second one from UK price was cheaper"
2,After years of waiting....what is this?,"This entire novel was devoted to characters walking around wondering why the sky is dark all the time. If your looking for something to happen look elsewhere. It's strange that the author writes in the back of the book that she has to extend the series by another novel, since 80% of this easily could have been cut. Almost as big a let down as George RR Martins exact same excuse in his new novel, a book we all waited around 5 years for only to discover 700 pages worth of everyone's least favorite characters doing nothing. There is one major downfall in both these new works and that it extremely lacks in events taking place and instead heavily leans on boring diatribe from characters we are already tired of."
3,3 stars for effort alone,"I admit that this series is quite a work of fantasy. I was sucked in immediately by the story told in the first three volumes. At volume 4 though, it started dragging. This, the 6th book, was a terrible disappoinment to me. After reading it, I wish I could of had a friend recant the story for me over a cup (just one cup) of coffee. Rarely do I feel this way about any books I read, but I feel that I wasted my time and money reading it.Nonetheless, I will read book 7. I remain hopeful that this obviously talented author will find a way to skillfully resolve all of the conflicts she's created and not gloss over anything or leave the reader hanging."
