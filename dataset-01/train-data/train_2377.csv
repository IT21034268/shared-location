3,for the hard core fans only...,"I thought with such a blockbuster title, this book would be impossible to put down... but instaed, at thirty nine thousand pages, it's impossible to pick up! As for the text itself, well, frankly, I had come to expect more from Mr Scully, whose previous efforts in the genre (""Allievial Homochromes: Diminished Thrip Fixage"") kept me home on Saturday nights, to the dismay of my cocktail-party-loving wife. I will admit the work contains valuable reference materials, and a lot of good charts, particularly on incipient gonad malformation; but even this topic is drier than one might hope.I will always anticipate Sully's latest work, though I would suggest that neophytes might be better served picking up any of his 1970s efforts (""Regenerative Dysphasiac Therapies: Slock Nodes"" for starters) before picking up this one."
5,Very Good Book,"I really liked the story. I am looking forward to reading ""Something Blue"". I hope I like it just as much."
5,Fabulous,"This was a really great book that I had seen several times at the store but never gave it a 2nd thought. I finally saw it at the 2nd hand store near my house for 29 cents and I said what the heck. Well I am so happy I did, it was one of the best books I have read in a while. FABULOUS!!! Easy and enjoyable read, would highly recommend it."
3,"""there are no moral absolutes?"" I disagree","OK: evidently I am the only reviewer who isn't drooling over this book, but I feel compelled to share my differing opinions. Yes, this book is entertaining in a way, and the pop culture references to the 80s are a Gen-X'ers dream come true. But I just couldn't swallow the whole premise of Dex cheating on his fiance (Darcy) with Darcy's best friend (Rachel) being acceptable because, well, Darcy's basically a witch. That doesn't make it ok! And yes, there are moral absolutes (the author begs to differ) and cheating on your fiance with her best friend should be taboo! Rachel struck me not as a heroine or winner, but as an idiot for wanting to be with someone who is a cheater. Call me crazy, but last time I checked, having an ""affair"" with your best friend's fiance is absolutely morally wrong."
1,Awful,"A friend and I both read this book and it was unimpressive. It was terribly slow, unentertaining, and I couldn't even finish it. It's too bad, since I had seen all the good reviews and really wanted to like it. Won't read books by this author again."
2,What they wanted vs. what they deserved,"The problem with Giffin's book is that the main characters only got what they wanted; they did not get what they deserved. I am usually a fan of chick-lit, but this book sorely disappointed me. While the writing was good, the plot lacked any subtleties. It was contrived and seemly written for those ""other"" women to make them feel better about their situations. I wish I could get my money back."
1,Bad book about bad friends,"I read this for my bookclub and I was baffled when I found out people actually liked it. There is nothing about this book that makes sense. If someone hates her best friend so much, why is she still her friend? It simply doesn't make any sense. The author tries to make the protagonist more likable by discussing her insecurities and dislikes but it has a hollow feel. I agree with other reviewers that this had the potential to make a really great book and to open up discussions about nice people doing bad things but in this case it was a huge failure. The fact that Darcy's character has no redeeming qualities whatsoever really throws off the balance of every other character in the book."
3,It was ok,"This is a book about a spoiled brat and her cheating fiance, that's seeing her so called best friend. It was alright. It kept my interest but its not one of those books that you just can't wait to get back to. I was kind of disappointed. I probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends."
2,Not Worth your Time,"I read this book because the first chapter sounded interesting, but it was definitely not worth the time I spent on it. There are a couple interesting events and a ton of boring whining by the unrealistically pathetic main character (I mean, seriously? Is anyone really that weak?) in between. All in all, the characters are flat and unbelievable, there's no wit in the writing, and the storyline is predictable, so what's the point in reading it? Truly the only interesting part of the book is reading the incredibly selfish, bitchy (and very unlikely) antics of the main character's friend Darcy. Pick it up if you have absolutely nothing else to read. If you're looking for some simple, fun chick lit, I recommend Jennifer Crusie instead. Sure, she doesn't write high-brow lit, but the banter is at least fairly witty and fun."
3,Something Borrowed,"I didn't think I'd end up liking the main character, Rachel, in this book, considering she's having an affair with her best friends fiance! But I did. Perhaps it's because the best friend/fiance is portrayed as so self-centered and shallow. I ended up really feeling for Rachel as she tries to reconcile her feelings about being the other woman and being in love with her best friends fiance. I also think she grows during the course of the book and learns more about herself. This is a nice, light summer read!"
2,Plain Read,"So, the plot of the book was good...Stealing your Best Friends Fiance(DRAMA!). Yet the characters are boring. For some reason I couldn't really create an image of the characters or a setting. The main character was a bit annoying because it took her forever to finally stand and give an ultimatum. Too much detail in the mist of getting to main points. Too many trips to the Hapmtoms...if anything the characters needed to be developed more. I am debating on reading ""Something Blue,"" hoping it will give the characters more depth. Currently reading ""Love the one you're with"" and sorry to say, thus far it is not sticking to me."
5,Miami Review,"Very entertaining! I really enjoyed this book! Emily Giffin paints the loviest pictures through her writing. She has that ""page turning"" quality that all writers wish they had. This book was fun and enjoyable; I would definately recommend it!"
2,Boring.....,"I purchased this book on my Kindle, big mistake! It is the never ending book! The characters are very bland and it's almost like Ms. Griffin was on a quest to make the book longer so she added a bunch of needless babble. I found myself thinking ""Get to the point!"" Not too sure where it's getting all the stars from but I definitely don't agree!"
2,SNOOZE!!!,"i was excited to read this book.. i watched the movie first & i usually do not do that, i always read first. anyways this book is a total bore compaired to the movie, again usually the movie is not good & the book is great.. it was not a bad book i did like the story line & i like that she & dex did get together however is was very boring & i found it hard to get through & then a good part would come & i would continue only to have it be a bore again :( way to much info on parts that really needed no explaining & paged upon pages of nothing chatter .. i am not sure i would recommend this book ever but the movie YES!!"
2,"Unrealistic story, underdeveloped characters.","I read this book because I wanted to do so before seeing the movie. I have to be up front and say that I'm not really a ""chick lit"" person and I didn't expect to LOVE Something Borrowed. However, I'd heard a lot of positive things about how it portrays the gray areas of having an affair blah blah blah. Unfortunately, I have to disagree with all of the glowing reviews that say as much. This story was unrealistic - the good characters were too good, the bad characters too bad, and (spoiler alert!) everything worked out far too perfectly in the end. Some say the ending was predictable but I disagree...it wasn't. But that doesn't mean it was GOOD. I think Giffin had a great premise with this story and could have made this a far better novel, but the entire thing just felt lifeless to me."
2,unlikeable characters,I read this book quickly because I wanted to get to the part where I could understand Rachel's decisions but it never happened. I found all three of the main characters to be unlikeable and it actually made me depressed. Awful friends and awful girlfriends/boyfriends.
2,Never really engaged me,"Perhaps I am in the wrong age group to really identify with the characters in this novel, and was never - even when I was this age - as obsessed with sex and ""hooking up"" and working 7 days a week like these NYC characters all seem to do, but this book never really engaged me, beginning to end. The life these young ""have everything"" people lived felt alien, and so totally self-centered and even arrogant, that I grew tired after the first several chapters of the constant angst, but refusal to do anything about it. I finally just longed for it to be over. I stuck with it, and as I feared, even with a partial resolution at the end, the book just .... stopped, with two of the main characters ""riding off into the sunset,"" figuratively speaking. I also purchased Something Blue but I don't think I will take the time to read it."
1,Disappointing.,"I really enjoyed Emily Giffin's ""Love the One You're With"" but ""Something Borrowed"" was simply annoying and contrived. I tried to finish it, but felt like I was wasting my time. It seemed like conversation was being repeated ad nauseam. I purchased ""The Help"" by Kathryn Stockett last week to return to good writing. It's a lot heavier topic but definitely worth my time. (""The Help"" is Ms. Stockett's first novel; it is fantastic and I'm only half way through it.)"
1,I could not stand RACHEL!!!,"I will give the book one star because the first chapter was great. The one about turning 30. After that I wanted to yell at Rachel and Dex, they were fustrating. Rachel was so weak and stupuid, to let that man have the best of both worlds. The book dragged on for way too long. I did finish the book because I was hoping she would end up in London. At least Darcy was fun, outgoing, and somewhat honest."
1,I can't believe I finished this book,"I've never written a review before, but I feel compelled to this time. It was just that bad. I didn't have to finish it, I kept waiting for it to get better, when it did not I resigned myself to finishing it. It wasn't that hard being a lightweight beach novel. It was a rainy saturday so I figured why not - it was only mildly better than finishing the laundry. I almost feel dumber for having read this. Is this really what women RELATE to? If so, that is so sad? I found every character in this book just sad. Mind you, I don't find the characters or the tale unbelievable, the tone that I should somehow empathize and root for true love. C'mon! Even for a book that isn't supposed to be intellectually challenging, it was nothing but a letdown. F-"
2,Chick book,"Entertaining summer read. Kind of cheesy, but it's a chick book. Written similarily in style to the ""shop-a-lolic"" series, if you enjoy the first person plus the inside-the-head thoughts of the narrator."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"Like most of the other reviewers I thought that this book was fun, light, and quite a page turner. That however does not warrant five stars in my book. This novel about a young woman stuck in limbo after cheating with her best friends fiancé is somehow lacking in depth. I know that this is intended to be a light read, but for me it was a little too light. I really enjoyed the first few chapters and was gearing up for something great, but after I while I really just wanted to the book to hurry up and get to the conclusion. Along the way I did enjoy some parts, but all in all I thought that the book was too long for the type of novel that it is. I may read another one of Mrs. Giffin's books in the future, however I will proceed with caution."
3,Sort of cringing the whole time,"I want to start by saying, I do like this book. The characters are well-developed and you can find an emotional connection with most of them.I hate to give anything away in the book, so I won't give away too many details, but it is a book that induces cringing--a lot. Though the subject matter can be considered ""chick lit,"" it explores infidelity and friendship. We get to view one side of a lifelong friendship, and while the other side is explained and developed through many eyes, I kept feeling like she was being sold short.I did not see the movie, but I liked the book and delving into the lives of two friends and their history as well as their potential future. It is also fairly realistic, and that is probably its best quality."
5,Held me captive until the very last page!,"I will be honest I am EXTREMELY tired right now. I stayed up way to late 3 nights this week reading Something Borrowed. After the first chapter or so I will admit I was a little bored, I felt like it was the same old chick lit that I have read a million times. But alas, I was wrong! I was enthralled by chapter 3! The characters are great, the plot line is great, something borrowed is an all around great book. I definitely recommend it to anyway who likes authors such as Jennifer Weiner, Plum Sykes etc. If you are looking for a good read you have found it here!"
1,"Something else, please!","I would rather be punched in the stomach than to be friends with these two women. We live and breathe in a world where there is enough drama and I prefer an immerse myself in feel-good characters that I read about. Although the author had a unique twist to the story at the end, the characters were both a bunch of backstabbers no matter how you slice it. ""With friends like these, who needs enemies?"" Oh, by the way: can we be more original than use NYC as a backdrop for the location? It's so Sex in the City- in this case, the book doesn't come close."
2,Can you still be a teenager at age 30?,"Rachel and Darcy are best friends. Rachel and Dexter (Darcy's fiance) wind up in bed together. The remaining 20+ chapters are devoted to Rachel's angst: Does Dex love her or Darcy? Will Dex call off the wedding? Should Rachel tell Dex that Darcy has been cheating on him? It's all very junior high school. I was never able to figure out Dexter's appeal, other than good looks and the fact that Darcy was engaged to him. Hardly the stuff of which soul mates are made. I DID read through until the end, and Giffin's sense of humor does make me smile, but this is not a novel about anything remotely approaching adult relationships."
5,Addicting Read,"The book was great, I couldn't put my Kindle down. BUT, the ending was slightly disappointing. I'm hoping that she created the ending for a reason...will the story with Dex continue?"
5,AN AUTHOR HEADED FOR GREATNESS!!,"This book is AMAZING and SO MUCH FUN--- a complete page turner. Buy it now and pray that St. Martins brings out that sequel sooner than next summer!! You will be dying to know what happens to Rachel, Darcy and Dexter. With Giffin's easy writing, the characters just come to life! Giffin captures intricacies of friendships like no one else. This is a must read for summer '04!"
2,Wimpy heroine,"This book was frustrating. Why would Rachel even be best friends with someone as self-centered as Darcy and why would a man supposedy as ""great"" as Dexter be involved with someone like Darcy? If I ever met a man who could propose to a jerk like Darcy, I would know he had a screw loose. Too bad Rachel didn't hook up with Hillary. Hah hah! Rachel and Dexter are both wimps, so maybe they do deserve each other. I think the novel would have been better and braver if the author had made Darcy a more sympathetic character. Instead, she conveniently makes her a bitch and has her sleep with someone else so the reader even feels less sorry for her. But that makes the rest of the story about Rachel and Dex tolerating and even liking Darcy even more unbelievable."
5,great book!!!!,"Awesome book for summer reading. Girly, and full of stories. Hard to stop reading. Awesome choice for some good and interesting girl book"
2,Predictable,"A predictable but easy beach read. Unfortunately, it glorifies infidelity. It is a shame a fun romantic book cannot also hold up some moral values."
3,I have read better books,This one just didn't . I read the whole book just because it was the only one I had at the time.
3,So-so,So-so. I didn't love & I didn't hate it. Not sure if I would read anything else by this author.
4,Cute easy read.,"I saw previews for this movie and ran home to read it first. The book was cute, an easy read. If call it a great poolside book."
1,doesn't anyone get concerned when we applaud a woman who betrays her best friend by having an affair with her fiance??,"if you (1) hate your best friend, (2) believe that the end justifies the means (no matter how many rules you break), (3) think that being nice/good is more of a handicap than a virtue, (4) enjoy character-stereotypes that leave no room for the color gray (only black and white: good vs. evil), and (5) feel that believable dialogue and fun references to growing up in the 80's make for actual ""literature"", then this is the book for you! enjoy! :)"
1,Not worth the time,"This book was waaaaay too long for the insignificant content. Much of the description was unnecessary and the longer the story dragged on the more boring it became. BUT I had to keep reading to find out if Rachel would develop a spine and dump her user of a lover and ""best friend"". Don't bother to read this book."
1,Are you kidding me? I HATED this character,"The main character of this book is by far the most unlikable protaganist I've ever come across. She sleeps with her best friend of 20 years fiance and doesn't feel guilty about it!! And she whines incessantly about how her friend is so lucky and how she's been outshone by her all these years. Well, maybe that's because you're an f'ing loser, sweetheart. The only reason I finished this book was because I was hoping she'd meet some terrible fate and end up even more miserable."
5,Couldn't Put This One Down!,"I am not one for romance novels, and had my fill of Sex in the City. I'm already in my 40s, and figured I would no longer be interested in a story about a gal who sleeps with her best friend's fiance. Think again! I could NOT put this book down---normally it takes me a month or more to get through a book, since I'm a working mother. But I read this in less than 2 days. It's not a cheap romance novel or Sex in the City rip off- it actually has substance and you find yourself rooting for Rachel and Dex, even though they are betraying Darcy in the worst possible way! It's complex; funny; and the author does a great job pulling off the story. I highly recommend it!"
3,Something Old & Something New,"""Something Borrowed"" is exactly the kind of book you think it will be - it's fluffy, romantic chic lit. Yes, it's well done and an enjoyable read, but in the end the plot is rather meager and apart from the intial twist (the love story in question is really an affair involving the narrator's best friend's fiancé), the story follows a fairly predictable trajectory.Giffin does a good job of making a fairly undesirable situation sympathetic, although there were times when the main character's wishy-washyness was frustrating and her refusal to take a stand an obvious ploy to drag the story out. Still, the author's characterizations are done well enough that you do root for Rachel even if she is stabbing her friend in the back.I devoured this book over the course of an afternoon. It's light reading - good for a day at the beach or if you want a breezy comfort read. I don't think it advances the genre in any real way, but it's certainly a solid addition."
3,Just not my thing...,"I read it because it is a NYTimes best seller and there is something inviting about the cover. I didn't think it was terribly written, but it just wasn't my type of read. It's definitely a soap opera filled with silly drama."
2,Not my favorite book,"Didn't care for this book---the premise behind the story or the story itself. I don't want to read a story where the heroine lusts after her best friends' fiance, and wins him. My basic sense of morality is offended."
3,Mindless Reading,"This book was mindless entertainment. If you like lifetime movies, you will like this book. I would think women would like it more than men do."
3,Just OK,I read reviews and expected a gripping story. Plot is very thin. Will not buy another one of her books
5,loved it,"I really enjoyed this, I could relate to the main character and was able to feel the pain as reading. Great when a writer can do this."
4,Fun Book,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun read. I'm reading ""Something Blue"" now, but it is NOT as good."
4,Something Borrowed,Emily Giffin does not let me down. this is the third book of her i've read and am enjoying the characters and the situations both believable and understanding. i look forward to reading another of her novels.
5,Great book,"Saw the movie a long time ago without reading the book, and loved it. But the book of course is better, what a great read I can't wait to read Something Blue. The book really made me understand the dynamics of the friendship of Darcy and Rachel. LOVED IT!!!!"
5,"Great book, great purchase",This book is great and I received it quickly and in the condition promised. I recommend this seller!
1,what a waste,"ok, so I disagree with almost everyone, I thought the book was stupid, shallow and just a waste of time. Good thing I was on the beach in Hawaii or I would have tossed it. Sorry,just a ""dumb blonde"" book."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"Like many other reviewers, I normally hate ""chick-lit"" and never would have looked at Emily Griffin's books until a friend of mine so highly recommended them. I'm so glad I took her advice and read this book. I couldn't put it down and finished in 2 days, reading bits in every free moment. I could relate to the main character in so many ways - Emily Griffin's portrayal of the childhood friendship between girls that continues into adulthood is spot-on. I loved this book!"
4,Good Read...,"I like the author quite a bit for chick lit. The references back to the 80's & 90's (childhood and teenage years) in general were quite good.The characters were interesting, although Darcy was a tad predictable. Overall a very good read that I'd recommend and give to my gf's."
1,It was pretty bad...,"I really didn't find any of the characters to be at all likeable. Rachel whined too much and felt too sorry for herself all of the time, Darcy is a vapid witch and I have no clue how or why anyone would be friends with her and Dexter was just an indecisive wimp. The only character who was mildly appealing was Ethan, and he was in exactly two chapters of the book. I bought it for a ""mindless"" summer read, but it was so stupid that I couldn't even be bothered to pick it up most of the time. I kept waiting for the story to pick up or for one of the characters to change, but that didn't happen. I really just wouldn't bother with this book at all."
1,Don't Bother,"I have been reading a lot of books since I got my kindle a year ago. This was probably the worst book I've read since I got it. The writing was poor, she was so annoying with ""It is.... this and It is... that (nobody talks like that in real life). I thought the plot stunk. How could she do that to her ""best friend"" and how could he do that to his fiancee. I won't be reading anymore in the series."
1,Really wanted to like it...,"Unfortunately, it was truly awful. I really wish I had stuck to the 50 page rule, but alas, I did not. The characters - all of them - are really REALLY unlikeable. Not funny or in any way uplifting - don't waste your time."
3,"half good, half bad","The beginning of the story was very entertaining, I enjoyed it very much and could not spot reading. It has some good insight on how women generally behave, and you are scandalized when yu can recognize yourself in some of the girls actions. However the last ten chapter were way too boring, it seemed as if the action had stopped.I do recommend it if you want some light reading to distract yourself from the stress of everyday life."
2,Glorifying stabbing your best friend in the back?,"The book is well written, with decent characters, but the relationship dynamics are where Emily Giffin lost me. Dexter is a sexy hero, Darcy got what she deserved, and if I were Rachel, I would have done the same thing????? Is this what we are supposed to be saying while reading this book? While Darcy wasn't a saint, I didnt read where she came close to deserving her best friend stealing her fiancee as this author wants us to believe.."
2,Surprising surprises,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. Although my review seems rather low, I did find the writing engaging and the characters well developed. The plot offered some surprises along the way."
4,An Easily Recommended Read,"This book was one that I enjoyed immensely on my recent vacation. It is rare that I actually have time to read, so vacations are usually spent doing just that. I brought this with several other books, but enjoyed this one so much that I ordered the sequel and had it delivered to me on vacation so I could read it too - Kudos to you, Emily! You have created that read that we are all looking for - a light, simple love story that makes you actually pull for the couple to be together. A wonderful read - I highly recommend it!"
5,I found this book..,"in the midst of me not knowing of which book to buy. Anyway, I love Rachel & I hate Darcy (you see, I kind of like Darcy in Something Blue). Maybe Rachel seems heartless snatching Dex the-soon-to-be-Mr Darcy but Darcy is a big-time self-centered. I suppose Dex made the right decision by withdrawing himself a week before the big day of Darcy and him. And Rachel if only she ascertain her feeling towards Dex while they were at Uni. .. apparently & definitely Dex & Rachel & Darcy would not end up in a terrible mess.."
4,An absolute Gem!,"I actually stumbled across this book while browsing in a near by book store that was closing its doors for good. I had not read any of the press or heard any of the raves about it until after I finished reading it.This book is an absolute gem! Emily Giffin may well be a literary genious! The story flows entirely well and the confliction felt by the main character is comparable to the emotional torment I, myself, have experienced (albeit under slightly different circumstances). Emily Giffin hits this nail square on the head!I cannot wait to delve into the sequel ""Something Blue"" - although I am awaiting shipment, as every local bookstore seems to be sold out. I KNEW I should have bought them both on ""clearance"" when I saw Something Borrowed in that store....This is a MUST READ for any helpless romantic. You'll laugh out loud and feel Rachel's confliction every step of the way."
5,What a great summer read!,Wow! I haven't read a book this juicy in some time. This is a must summer read. Great work Emily Giffin! Can't wait to read Something Blue.
2,Predictable and Unrealistic,"A 'love story' that seemed just too unrealistic. It dragged on and while I had some sympathy for the characters, they did not do enough soul searching about what they were really doing and it was hard to have any respect for any of them. This was an ok book but not any where near the quality that I was hoping. If you like good fiction with engrossing characters and stories then move on. This was written like a made for tv movie."
2,something borrowed,i am really surprised this book has such good reviews. the characters have no depth and the story just kept getting sillier and less fulfilling. rachels pathetic nature grew tiresome. it was easy to read though felt a bit like watching a reality show...entertaining at times but very little substance.
5,AWESOME-Laugh and cry! So well written!,I absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED this book!! I could NOT stop thinking about it once I was done! I went straight on to reading Something Blue. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes an easy read that will make you crack up and even shed a few tears!!
2,Chick Lite - sure is!,"I read this book thinking it would be a cute love story - but I didn't like the characters - didn't know or get to know the characters and I didn't like the story because it was all about lying, selfishness, jealousy, and self-absorbtion. Thought I would want to see the movie - but the book turned me off to that. There just was no depth to this book, characters or story. Luckily, I didn't pay much for the book and I can sell it to someone else. Rarely do I find a book where I would like a refund - but this is one of them."
3,"Infidelity, Infidelity, Infidelity",Dreary but realistic. This is not the end all book on why people stray but it is a good book.
4,Fun Summer Romance!,"This book was engaging and a very easy read. Somewhat predictable yet still exciting and fun. I am now interested in Emily's book, Something Blue...."
2,I HATE RACHEL,"I read something blue first and then something borrowed. When I read Rachels character I could not believe how selfish and whiny she was. Of course Darcy outshone her. Dary is confident, a go getter, and someone who takes charge. I was so upset that this Rachel was being portrayed as some kind of heroine in this book. How can we condone something such as sleeping with your best friend's fiance? If you read something blue you will see that even despite the fact that Rachel resented Darcy, Darcy was a true friend to her. I think this was so sad that Rachel got her happy ending. I was hoping she'd get run over a bus or something."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"I purchased this book on a recommendation from a friend: I was in for a surprise. The main character is a whiny, spineless ""girl"" who cannot stand up against her ""bully"" best friend who stole her former crush? & then they ""accidentally"" had drunken sex and tried to hid it from her before her marraige? Really!? The entire book is one long, whiny disappointment. There are far better reads out there. Don't waste your money."
1,Not much substance,"It's not so much about the simple writing, the flat characters, the predictable plot. For me it's all about the author not even having enough respect for her readers to be more creative. Not much of a book, just like movies and tv aren't much either these days, either. The author gets credit for actually writing books, getting them published and reviewed. But you'd think she'd want to write something of some value. Surprises? Oh, please. We all slog through it, hoping for the best. The best never comes. Another shallow beach book."
1,OH gosh...,"This is the worst book I have EVER read and that includes this awful book I read in January that had an evil gnome as a main character. Don't ask.Okay, but back to ""Something Borrowed"" which is referring to a girl ""borrowing/doing it with"" her best friends fiance.Right then and there I should have just put the book down. This book did not keep me interested. I would have been more than content finding out the ending to it via google but since it was one of the first books I purchased on my Kindle I felt this responsibility to finish it.Anyway, long story short if you want to read a book where all the characters just whine and complain about their lives, this is the book for you.Also, if you are currently cheating or have cheated on a boyfriend, fiance, or your husband and you need someone to tell you that you didn't do anything wrong, again this is the book for you."
2,Like eating cheap chocolate,"That's exactly what reading this book was like. You can't put it down, devour it all in a sitting or two, then end up completely unsatisfied when it's all over. The writing was interesting and I particularly liked the many insights, but Rachel got off too easy - far too easy for a fictional character, anyway. Darcy, typecast as the 'evil' friend, tied up the ends altogeter too nicely. I was waiting to see how Rachel would have to pay the piper, but apparently she didn't have to get her hands dirty. In the end, the reader is the one left covered in dollar-store chocolate."
3,I'd give it 3-1/2 Stars if I could,"This is a great book for the beach. Griffin succeeds in writing a book that is a big page-turner. I stayed up late reading this book to find out more more more about the Darcy-Rachel saga. I kept thinking I'd be able to stop in one more chapter, but the suspense just kept building and building. I liked the protagonist, Rachel, but by the end of the novel I found her to be a big of a whiner and also a pushover. Plus, as a newlywed it wasn't easy for me to overlook the immorality of her decisions no matter how selfish and superficial and nasty Darcy was portrayed. The ending was too neatly tied up and I'd guessed what the twist would be long before it was revealed. If you like chick-lit, this is a great choice for you. It's great if you're looking for a light read that has a lot of flash-in-the-pan kind of suspense and thrills."
2,Unreadable,"This book is so shallow. I tried to read it but had to give up somewhere around page 75. D'arcy is *such* a cliche - just way too one-dimensional and loathsome. Also, I found it boring to read on and on about relationships with no other plot developments. Clearly, I'm in the minority here but that's my story and I'm sticking to it!"
2,Not nearly as good as I thought it would be-,Two stars because none of the characters are likable. There wasn't one that I was rooting for or wanted to see what happened to. Disappointment.
4,"Plain Jane living in the ""fast"" lane","I read this book after reading some of Giffin's other novels, and this one is by far my favorite. Rachel and Dex genuinely fall in love and you find yourself applauding the breakup of an engagement and friendship between two best friends. Nonetheless, it is an easy and entertaining read. I wish I would have read this book before I had read some of Giffin's other work. I would recommend this to a friend."
4,Good read,"Very nice book. Interesting insight into the relationship between women friends. As someone who has had her fair share of ""giver/taker"" relationships I found that Ms. Giffin really understood how these relationships function, until they don't any longer."
2,It was ok,"Worth the read if only to get you to ""Something Blue"" which I found to be the better of the two in the series.There was something about the dialogue (mainly from the male perspective, specifically Dex) that threw me throughout the book; it made me feel that it was forced. Not to mention that Rachel's inner monologue would abruptly answer questions that other characters would pose (for example, Darcy mentioning Dex and Rachel's thoughts suddenly spitting out for the reader, ""Because I'm sleeping with him..."") in a way that grew old quickly. It was hard for me to side with Dex and Rachel considering that, most of the time, I just wanted them both to simply put up or shut up about it all. I just wasn't a fan of the pair of them.I wasn't crazy about Darcy either until ""Something Blue"", which I almost didn't pick up; though I highly recommend to all. I even felt the dialogue and relationships were smoother and more natural in that one."
3,Not What I Expected,"I must say I was a little mislead by the title. This book was nothing that I expected. It was a little disappointing, but the plot that ended up occurring was executed well."
3,Something Borrowed,"The story kept my attention, however I couldn't get past the fact that the main characters werepeople I couldn't really respect(reagardless of their excuses and rationalizations for theirbehavior)--., no sense of honor whatsoever"
5,LOOOOOOVED THIS BOOK,"I loved the story, the characters, the detail, all of the events, the setting.......basically everything about it. I found myself thinking ""I know exactly how this feels...."" It isn't all happy, sappy, unrealistic. Stuff happens and sometimes things don't always turn out as expected. This is part one followed by ""Something Blue."" I will reread this book I'm sure of it."
4,"I liked it, despite what Rachel did","Ok, so maybe Dex and Rachel messed up when they hooked up. He was with Darcy for 7 years and Rachel was her best friend since they were children! But still i really enjoyed reading this book and really thought that Rachel and Dex deserved each other and despite the fact that Darcy was hard to like, I was anxious to read her story and her point of view. Overall, i really enjoyed the book."
3,Fun read,"This book was fun to read although I grew to hate Rach, I think she is a jerk for doing something like that to her lifelong friend."
3,something borrowed,Disappointing!!! This book was slow moving and Rachel came across as the victim. Hello how can you be the victim since childhood.The characters were self centered.
4,Something Borrowed,"I got this book through GoodReads' giveaways. Emily Giffin's covers have always attracted me because they look so simple but elegant.The book is about Rachel, who just turned 30, is not married and is a good friend to Darcy ... until her drunken birthday party where she sleeps with Darcy's soon-to-be husband. Rachel feels horrible and so does Dexter( the Fiance). They vow to never do it again, but soon realize they feel something toward one and other.Most of the book is Rachel either talking to herself or to others about Darcy. Her friends think has some comeuppance and deserves what Rachel did/ is doing. It was the kind of book I wanted to talk back to and say, ""yeah she may have deserved it, but it's still wrong to do."" So sometimes the book was a little frustrating, but something kept me hooked to find out what was going to happen.There is a sequel to this book that is all about Darcy called Something Blue. It may fall in my to be read mountain."
3,Pretty Good. Easy to read.,"This book was pretty good. I felt like I was reading Something Blue, but of course from Rachel's view of what went on. I had read Something Blue and liked it very much, which led me to purchase this one. Although this was a very quick and easy read...I felt like I already knew the story."
3,giffin's books...,"I've read a couple of them now because I like the style and I do want to see how they turn out...but I have come to realize that you just can't plan on liking ANY of the characters in ANY of the books. They are so flawed and pathetic with no inspiring qualities. That said, the stories flow along and as long as you go into the books with the attitude of ""eh...it's just a story""...then they're enjoyable.I really think in this particular book Rachel is a sell-out, Dex is a shallow jerk, and Darcy is an irritating egomaniac. I'll give the others in the series a try to see if any of the characters redeem themselves, but I'm not expecting them to.This is the perfect book for when you're ""in between"" better books."
2,Why did reviewers give this 5 stars?,"Searching for a new author of romantic comedy? Keep looking. Although Griffin's a pretty good writer, this book is a dog. The plot is: girl really likes boy; girl introduces boy to best friend who snatches him up; 10 years later, on eve of boy's wedding to best friend, girl has a fling with him and ends up breaking up the wedding. This is funny?? These are characters you want to know?? The characters hardly talk to each other, so there's no clever conversation, and there's no action either. I'm not into betrayal and I don't understand the 10-year time lag (I understand that being 30 is a big deal in this plot, but if turning 30 doesn't freak you out, major motivations are not going to make sense to you). This book is dull, so if you're looking for good romantic comedy, try another author."
5,Great Book,"This is a soap opera type of book that will absolutely wow you! This author is the new up and coming star of the romance world. Read all of her works as well as another newcomer- Katlyn Stewart ""Fire In The Ice""."
1,Shallow shallow shallow,"I bought this book because of all the positive reviews. These are some of the lamest, weakest, and most pathetic characters I have come across with these kinds of reviews. Come on.... I know this is fiction, but could I at least have some postive characters that have some dignity and respect going for them?"
1,Worst book I've read in some time!,"This was the worst book i've read in some time; the whinning just got to me and instead of feeling compassion for Rachel, I found myself resenting her self deprecating and annoying view of her life; I do not have time for weak women;"
5,LOVED IT!!,THIS BOOK WAS GREAT... BUT IT REALLY DOES MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT FRIENDS AND ESPECIALLY TRUST!!
4,Phenomenal Audio Book & Received Quick & As Described,"The book, even on CD, was phenomenal. I have even shared it with a girlfriend who teared up, its that moving. And it was received quick and as described by the seller."
2,I didn't respect the main character enough to like this book.,"I hated Rachel through out the whole book. If Darcy was such a shallow person, why be her best friend for 20 years? Doesn't that make Rachel just as shallow (if not more) for sleeping with her best friends fiance? It was difficult for me to like this book when I didn't like any of the characters."
4,Cute adult chick-lit with more substance than fluff.,"This is my first shot at an Emily Giffin novel after receiving several recommendations from friends and I must say that I was very happy with the selection!It's a quick read that I found hard to put down. I loved the characters, the forbidden love story... and as a 30 year old myself, the 80s pop culture references were a delightful opportunity to giggle."
3,Enjoyed this book,I purchased this book after seeing the movie. I enjoyed the book although it was a bit slow at times. The book is not as good as the sequal something blue but it is noteworthy.
2,A Cold Book,I found this book really hard to relate to. The characters all seemed fake and unrealistic to me. I really wanted to give this book a chance since I am such a chick lit fan but this book just made me want more feeling and depth. Emily Giffin tried to incorperate these things but it never sparked any feelings with me. There are too many good books there to read this one.
5,What if you borrow someone else's fiancé??!!,"The funny part about Something Borrowed is that I read its follow up (Something blue) before! In Something Borrowed the reader understands what brings Dex to call off his dream wedding with Darcy, who comes across as too beautiful, too rich, too lucky and too full of crap! However, the reader discovers that Darcy's best friend Rachel is not the holy Virgin one might have thought of...! Read more on my blog 'Books in the backpack' [...]"
3,Got you thinking,This book was decent. It really did get you thinking about friendships. We have all had some similar story to Darcy and Rachels although maybe not as extream. Sometimes is best to just move on. At times it seemed a little drawn out but it was a nice easy read.
4,Liked it but...,"I liked this book, but the ending left something to be desired. Even though, in the end, things ended up the way I wanted them to, I still wasn't satisfied."
1,Horrible waste of time!,"If I had known how it ended, I would not have wasted my time. I cannot fathom how anyone can cheat on another person, particularly someone you ""love""... it just doesn't make sense to me. I feel that the ""heroine"" is a spineless, weak, unethical character who lacks morals. *sigh* I hated this book. The fact that the author tries to justify WHY the character cheats with her best friend's fiance' just boggles the mind. I'm completely appalled by the characters and the overall outcome of this book... as someone who's been cheated on, this book is horrible!"
1,An utterly dislikable cast of characters,The main character is a horrible friend and does the unthinkable by falling for her best friend's fiancee. I could not identify with any of the characters bc I felt disgust for all of them. The ending was a complete cop-out and this book genuinly disturbed me with its utter lack of regard for friendship and love and honesty. Emily Giffin is a great writer - it was the plotline I despised.A word of advice - if you have ever had your heart broken and been betrayed by a friend at the same time then this book is not for you. It made me furious and sad when I read it.
1,"Horrible, Distasteful, Painful","absolutely horrible! i have no idea where this book is getting all the stars from?!extremely awful plot.painful narration.spineless characters.im surprised i actually made it to the end, but then again i just kept clicking next page.reading every other paragraph actually works cause the whole story was written in one painfully long babble."
2,A big disappointment,"I really wanted to like this book as I've been in the mood for some chick-lit recently...and an overwhelming number of reviews here say it's great...but i just don't understand it. This book is such a major disappointment! UGH! I really hate the main female character Rachel, I hate the main male character and I really don't care about any of the other characters. By the end I was just skimming past the ridiculousness to get to the conclusion which was pretty lackluster at best. I was planning on reading the other Emily Griffin books but after this one, I think I had better move onto some other author."
3,hard to root for the main character,"The writing was pretty good, the story was like watching a train-wreck....you know it's going to end badly but you can't stop yourself from watching.The whole time I was reading this, I was thinking to myself that the relationship was just wrong. If a man will cheat on his fiancee, nevermind his feelings for another, how can she ever fully trust him not to do it to her. What if he falls in love with someone else down the line. That is classic!No matter how selfish and spoiled Darcy may have been, neither of them should have carried on the affair. Dex *was* spineless in that he waited until the last moment to break it off with Darcy. If he was so in love with Rachel, he should have done it immediately. Rachel was the backup.I am still interested in the sequel to this story, but the author has her work cut out for her redeeming the Darcy character after slandering her to make Rachel and Dex's relationship go down easier."
2,Something Borrowed,"This book was one of the worst books I've ever read. I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I would give it zero stars. It might appeal to someone under 30. Perhaps a 15 year old, but if over 30, forget it. It was a shallow, unlikely story. It was a total waste of time, and I will not pursue other books written by this author."
3,Something Annoying,While I enjoyed the book and found the initial concept interesting I overall didn't love the book. However I would say that i'm the exception and most women would love the book. My problem was that I didn't identify with the main character making it difficult for me to understand and like her. But it was definitely interesting once you start you won't want to stop.
1,Not at all good,I have to say that I didn't like this book at all. I am not even keeping it in my library. All the waiting around for him to make up his mind is absurd. There is no bone in her or in the book. There is nothing to tell.
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!,"I HAVE BECOME OBSESSED WITH THIS BOOK! I CANNOT WAIT FOR ""SOMETHING BLUE"" TO COME OUT! I WILL BE ON VACATION AT THAT TIME AND WILL PUT IT FIRST ON MY BOOK LIST!NOW I COMPARE EVERY BOOK TO THIS ONE AND CANNOT FIND ONE TO HOLD MY INTEREST QUITE AS MUCH! I LOOK FORWARD TO MANY MORE GREAT BOOKS FROM EMLIY GIFFIN!"
3,Average writing but mildly entertaining,"This book certainly maintained my interest and I found it mildly entertaining. It is a very quick read.However, in my opinion, it truly serves as a prequel to Something Blue. Something Borrowed develops the characters so that the reader can more fully appreciate and enjoy the plot in Something Blue."
4,Great read with an EVEN BETTER sequal,"I really enjoyed this book about what happens when two people find out their true feelings for eachother when it's almost too late. It explores friendships, what they mean, the competitions within them, the dynamics of them and, of course, love.I actually read this book after Something Blue which is the sequal to this book. I read it more or less to get the back story as I absolutely adored Something Blue. I am glad I read it.Definetly worth reading and I would reccomend it. One of the better chick lit type of books that I've read. Not to mushy and you really get lots of back history on the characters, which make them more realistic and easy to understand or relate to. I really like Emily Giffin's writting style and can't wait to see more from her.Be sure to read Something Borrowed (this one) before Something Blue. I would put Something Blue in one of my top 20 list of books."
2,Not worth it,This book started out ok but as you go through the entire length it becomes obvious the main character is wimpy and someone I did not admire. She became so dependent on her best friends' fiancee that she stopped being herself. It ended well but I will definitely not be reading any more by this author.
4,Well written chick-lit.,"This book is so much fun! You might get a little worried, because things start up right off the bat - Wham! Bang! And you're thinking, ""Where could one possibly go from here?"" But what proceeds is a spunky romp through the lives of some narcissistic, self-obsessed, and self-deprecating people, whom you know you've met before. It's fun because you've got a ringside seat to a train wreck, and you're so thankful you're cuddly cozy in your home not worrying about ridiculousness like this. The tone and writing of the book is a blast, and it goes so fast you end up reading it in a couple of sittings. Everyone I know who has read it loves it, and the only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it's not really very ""literary""."
4,Better than expected,"I don't typically like romance books, however, I read this book on recommendation from a friend. And though I didn't particularly like the main character, who's perspective the book is from, I found that I couldn't stop reading it!"
4,it just ended,"it was great way better than the movies,.. but it ended .... i mean it just ended left more openbut over all great loved it... get it"
4,Fun Read,"Fun read and enjoyed the book. The storyline was interesting and kept my attention. Even so though I don't really have an interest in reading the sequel. Since the 2nd book is about the character that you aren't rooting for in the first, it doesn't have much appeal for me. This book I would recommend though."
2,Not Great,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that I just couldn't help but wrap my brain around the idea that it's okay that Rachel, the supposed heroine in the book, was cheating with her best friend's fiance. I didn't even like her that much-- she created her own situations (remaining friends with a person she really didn't even seem to like, being so jealous of that friend that she could barely see straight, staying in a job she loathed, etc) and continually blamed everyone else for her miserable choices. Her lack of any sense of self-esteem seemed to be a driving force in this book and her rivalry for her ""friend"" was annoying. Not that Darcy was blameless, but I couldn't help but wonder why on earth I should be rooting for Rachel either. Not my favorite chick-lit book (and I've read a ton of them that I adore-- like anything by Sophie Kinsella!) and I'm not sure I will read ""Something Blue"" even though I bought it with this book."
4,Prequel for Something Blue,"This book is suppose to be a prequel for Something Borrowed but I don't think it matters if you read it out of order. This is the same story as Something Blue but from the perspective of Rachel, the smart, hard working, good girl that was best friends with Darcy the pretty popular girl. Rachel is a devoted friend and also a little naive to Darcy. Rachel sets up Darcy with one of her male classmates at law school and watches them get engaged and on the verge of marriage. Then, on Rachel's 30th birthday party, she has a fling with Darcy's fiance. It is shocking to her but she doesn't want to stop. She struggles with her loyalty to Darcy or following her heart for a guy she liked but never had the confidence to go for herself, but rather set him up with her pretty friend."
4,A nice surprise!,"I bought this book to take on summer holiday - and was expecting the typical 'chick lit' read. But instead I found it to be engaging, the characters very real - and funny - and the plot moved along at a brisk pace. It was a nice surprise to read a contemporary author with such a finely honed and distinct style. It's not literature - but it's a fun and entertaining read."
2,I'm gonna have a BF (bitch fit)!,"This book is ridiculous, don't waste your time. I was forced to read this book by my book club but I would not recommend it. The characters are all petty, self-absorbed, immature and despicable. I think the Wayan's brothers did a much better version of this story, it was called ""White Chicks."""
2,"Not offensive, just boring","I knew what the book was about and wasn't offended with the main characters being ""cheaters."" I simply just thought the book was dull- mainly because the characters were not likable. Darcy was utterly obnoxious - the author obviously did not want the reader to like her, which therefore made me wonder why ANYONE would like her, including Rachel (who stuck around as her best friend for 20 years) and Dex. Dex was average; I wouldn't have been surprised if he had turned around 3/4 of the way through and screwed over Rachel (he wasn't a bad guy, but he didn't seem that incredible). Rachel was okay, but I wasn't drawn to her. I do not normally read ""chick lit"" books, but I'm not opposed to them; I was looking forward to reading a silly romance series. However, after reading this first installment, I do not think I will be reading the sequel."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book after seeing it as Target as their spotlight book - the plot looked interesting and from the reviews that I read - I had high expectations.I think the main reason that I didn't love the book is that I didn't love Rachel - the main character. She seemed really needy and to be honest - I didn't really want her to be with Dex (the love interest and fiance of her best friend, Darcy). I thought that she was shamelessly persuing Dex and that she was way too accomodating towards him - which really annoyed me. The only characters that I really found myself liking were Rachel's friends Hillary and Ethan, her confidant's that give her advice.While I didn't love the characters, I did find myself drawn to the story to see what would happen and if Rachel would end up with Dex. The book is a quick read and would make for interesting summer reading."
5,A READER FROM NORTH CAROLINA,"This is a wonderful book, I could hardly believe that it was her first novel. I read it in one day because I could not put it down. I have already lent it out to two friends who also read it within a 24 hour period. Highly recommend buying this book. Also, since I live in North Carolina I found the basketball right on about Duke fans, they are that crazy."
1,Should have gone with my gut,"I thought about reading this book about 3 weeks ago, but thought against it when I read the reviews. However, I had second thoughts and bought it this weekend. I really immensely disliked this book - I disliked Rachel and her weakness, jealously and envy of Darcy. Rachel was a pathetic character and weak to allow herself to be a doormat to Darcy who was pretty,popular and obnoxious - which she was because she got away with it. Rachel invited the pity party and she should have taken the opportunity to stand up for herself countless times. I ended up skipping pages just to get to the end. I'm just perplexed, confused and surprised that his book has garnered so many positive reviews, not to mention the movie and the others that have been optioned by this author. To each his own, I guess."
2,The movie trailer is more interesting than the book.,"There are no redeming qualities about these characters. The characters are so black and white. There is the spineless plain jane Rachel and the beautiful but shallow Darcy. The book tried hard to convince me these characters are best friends but failed. Everytime Rachel would feel guilty about the affair, she would have a flashback about Darcy treated her so cruelly in the past. She just wanted to justify her betrayl. This trick got very old. The men are also weak and useless. I am wondering the same thing as other reviewers and ask how someone rates this book so high. Don't waste your time."
1,Not worth the Money!!!,This author is long winded and has no direction to the story line - I really don't know how this book got published - I feel so cheated!!!
4,loved the movie,"so I read the book, which was really good even after watching the movie. Books are always better than the movie."
2,Not a fan,This was my first Emily Giffin novel and I just have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of this book. I wasn't really sure if I was happy the way it ended or not. I ended up not really liking any of the characters at all. Big disappointment.
3,3.75 stars with mixed feeling on this book,"Dex and Rachel flounder through the whole book regarding their affair. There was some emotions, but yet it also felt a little cold - kind of like observing a lab experiment. Know how horrible Darcy was also helping in feeling empathetic to Dex and Rachel's plight, yet it was at odds knowing that cheating is wrong.I did question why Dex stayed with Darcy after the initial night, then after several times, why didn't he break it off with her??? It made me think less of him.The book itself was NOT very romantic and not graphic. It really needed something to liven it up."
4,Fabulous beach read!,I really enjoyed this page turner while I was on my beach vacation. The characters were well developed and you love the twists and turns that the author writes for each. This is set between Manhattan and the Hamptons and I am familiar with each and enjoyed all the references to restaurants and bars etc. Great book with a nice twist at the end. I am onto Something Blue now!
1,Don't waste your time,"I didn't have a problem with the morality of the cheating. Happens all the time. What I did object to was the two-dimentionality of the main characters. All were cliched, boring and predictable. And Darcy's revelation? How convenient to justify Rachel and Dex's behavior. I agree with the reviewers who wondered about all the praise. You want to step into the book, shake Rachel and tell her to get on with it! You're living in one of the most exciting cities in the world and you can't find one other decent man? Weak plot, weak characters, several hour of my life I'll never get back."
1,Awful manipulation,Rachel was portrayed as whiny and lacking courage and honesty. It was very manipulative to have the Darcy character as also having an affair and worse as pregnant in order to justify Rachel's own infidelity. I hope the author chooses to be more bold and original by writing characters and situations that do portray grayness of life. I hope Emily Griffin chooses to challenge financial success in order to present untold stories of love. Please stop recycling (down cycling) love tales that only serve to excuse dishonesty and fear.
1,It's been a while since I read this book,"...but I hated it. It frustrated me to no end. The only reason why I finished it was because it was recommended to me by a friend who said it was really good. I kept reading and reading, hoping it would get better. But it just got worse and worse and worse.This is a do not buy. If anything, borrow it from a friend, borrow it from the library. Waste of space on my bookshelf.. it made me so angry that I had to put it in a box out in the shed because it was a constant reminder of all the time I wasted reading the book."
4,Entertaining read,"At first I was upset that I had read the sequel of this book first but after I began reading I realized that it didn't really matter Something Borrowed and Something Blue are the same story told from two opposite points of view; best friends betrayed by each other. Darcy is betrayed by Rachel when she sleeps with Dex, Darcy's fiance, and Rachel is betrayed by Darcy when she does many many other things. I found both of their behavior sleazy, selfish and disgusting but who doesn't love to read a little drama? Giffin's work to me seemed innovative for the Chick Lit field and I look forward to reading more."
5,Did not feel sympathetic for Rachel ...although that didn't stop me from loving the book.,"Something Borrowed is a great book, and even though I didn't like Rachel's character, I think the situation that the writer created is one that a lot of girls happen to embark. I think every girl must read this book. This book is simply sending out the message that you should go for whatever you want or who ever you love, and thats a message I absolutely love."
4,friendship vs true love,"I can visualize this story being put into film!The ending can be more in depth & traumatized though... it seems to me the ending is too ""easy""..."
4,A great beach read,"I bought this in paperback so that I could take it to the beach (still too paranoid about ruining my Kindle with salt/sand/water), and I wasn't disappointed. Maybe it's because I don't demand too much from my beach books, but I thought this was a well-written story. The characters were well-developed, and I thought that Giffin did a great job of capturing the ""love-hate"" relationship that close friends sometimes develop. I liked the ending as well--I thought it was a great mix of the craziness of real life and the tidy feeling of resolution that is delivered at the end of a novel."
4,Wonderful and Witty,This book came at a perfect time just as my daughter is entering adolescence! I enjoyed the witty and edgy humor of this great book! Great buy!
3,Not so great.,Marc Antony is a better live performer sorry to say. Although there are some great songs here by Manuelle. He tends to talk too much during his concerts which is a waste of time.
3,Nunca igual que estar en el Concierto,"Yo fui al concierto Del Madison Square Garden, y jamas el DVD se iguala a la Fantastica Presentacion que Victor Manuelle en vivo. Corto muchas partes buenas ademas que solo una hora y media para el DVD no me gusto. NO le hace justicia el DVD al concierto para nada."
2,No how-to details,"This book provides an excellent overview of high-tech PR tools. But it says almost nothing about how actually to communicate well. For example, on page 53 she cites one woman as being an expert on gaining reporters' attention with effective subject lines. But she does not provide even one example of an effective subject line!At the end of the book, she does include a sample press release format. Beware -- it's a template for an extremely boring ""us too"" press release!"
2,"Susan Kohl, Getting Attention","This book is targeted for novices who know nothing about high-tech PR and marketing. If you are new to the world of technology, then the book might be worth leafing through. Otherwise, it is a complete waste of time because the author does not offer any new perspectives. The reference guide at the end of the book is very self-promotional. When you read the book, you can tell that the author knows what she is talking about. The problem is she wanted to target the book to everyone which made the content very basic."
1,Buyer beware!,"I ordered this watch as a gift and was pleased to get it for far less than the retail price. When I received the watch it was clearly not authentic. The crystal is convex and appears to be a polymer composite as it distorts the dials when looking at it from any angle other than straight on. I investigated further by going to the mall where they sell the same watch and it was clearly not of the same quality. Beware of buying watches online, most are fakes."
4,Beautiful...but...,"I love my watch, it is so nice and it looks great with any outfit, from jeans to a cocktail dress, however, I wore it for less than 1 month and it stopped working. I had to send it for repair and now I have it back, I must say that Bulova has a great Repair Service, even though they never contacted me, they returned my watch properly working within the 30 days they state as the time fence."
4,Saved well over $100 fro Amazon.,"I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend. She saw it at Macy's and it was well over $100 more, on sale. The only thing I noticed was that the pearl face was not as ""pearlescent"" as the ones I saw at Macy's. All and all she loves it, and all the diamonds."
3,Disappointing,"I am a great fan of Brian Wildsmith's art, however, this book is not at all up to his usual standards (though my 2 year old son likes it). Furthermore, the nursery rhymes include a number of macabre and violent ones, which I would rather not subject my son to."
4,Same book same pictures,"I purchased ""Great Escapes""- Inspirational homes in stunning locations & ""Great Escapes""- Dream homes in fabulous locations. Both By Judith Miller. Buy the less expensive one. It's the same book with the same pictures."
5,Great protection for electronic items,"I bought my first one of these to protect a handheld GPS that was under the seat of my car most of the time. Texas temperature extremes can be tough on delicate electronic gear like MP3 players, cameras, cell phones, or GPS units, and this does a good job of protecting such a device from temperature extremes, dust, dirt and accidental spills.I now have several of them which I keep on items like cameras and audiophile headphones even in the house or workshop. If it's (a) valuable or (b) delicate or (c) gets exposed to temperature extremes, it gets one of these on it, now. They work great in your luggage around your camera, or in the trunk of your car."
3,I should have read the reviews.,I thought this was a travel video. It's not. I should have paid more attention to the reviews. I can't use it.
4,Handwash only!,I had to buy a new one because they are NOT dishwasher safe! The inside corroded and I had to hammer the attachment off of my mixer.
4,Interesting look at the great DL Sayers,"I've always loved Sayers 'Wimsey' stories and so I enjoyed looking at her work from a different perspective. I thought some of the theories drew a bit of a long bow but they were still stimulating. Easy to read too, so no need for a degree in Comparative Literature.Recommended for anyone interested in Sayers and/or Britain between the wars."
5,A Sweet Investment,"I can't say enough good things about these lectures, which mesh Celan, Simonides and Karl Marx with a grace that makes their union seem inevitable. The way Carson folds together money, language and memory reminds me of Ezra Pound without the shouting. Her insights have a math-like clarity (""Eureka! I've got it!"") that brings two extreme ends of our history under the same light. You'll never mistake negation and loss for modern inventions after reading this book. The coins have changed since Simonides's time but the economy's remarkably the same. The funny thing is, after Carson's dazzling treatment, lament never looked so good."
4,Understanding postproduction,"I bought this book to provide me with an overview of the administrative process of post production in post-production houses or other organizations providing these services.The authors provide an excellent overview of the process and the book suits my needs very precisely. It is not a useful book for the general reader, or even a reader interested in films, or even film production.It provides no useful information about the creative process of film or video editing either. So editors looking for creative tips etc are advised to go to Pepperman or elsewhere.If you are somehow involved in the post-production process and want to know how your job fits into the whole process, or if you are an intern about to work in a post-production facility. This book is for you."
5,Post-Production Bible!!!!,"Susan Spohr and Barbara Clarke have created nothing short of a post-production bible. BRAVISSIMO to them both!! I would not have survived the last year in my job without their brilliant book!!! Everything flows in a clear, concise way, bringing the reader visually into the post-production process. Read this book and keep it with you as a reference tool! I guarantee you it is well worth your time!"
1,An Editorial Disaster - Stay Away!,"I was suckered into buying this worthless book for a survey class I took on Post-Production for Film and Television. What I hoped would be an enabler to my education turned out to be a hurdle: the book is poorly organized, the concepts aren't clearly explained, and the entire text is fraught with spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. When the authors aren't clogging the text with jargon, they're giving you advice on how to do business in this industry. If you work in the industry, as I do now, this book won't tell you anything you don't know already. If you want to learn about the process, this book won't enlighten you. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this editorial disaster!"
5,Great for licorice lovers,If you like black licorice this is for you. This was a gift for my borther and he loves black licorice. He was amazed by the different choices.
5,Scrumpsous,I purchased this for myson-in-law. He loves black licorice andwas very excited with the variety. WILL consider buying it again
2,I am amazed at the number of 5 star reviews,"I already have a lot of wooden spoons and silicon spatulas. I purchased both the silicon covered flat whisk and the balloon whisk about 3 years ago.Once a year, I pull them out of the drawer in an attempt to prove my money was not wasted on this purchase.These whisks have a very soft silicon coating on the beater portion that tends to drag on the non-stick surface of the pans. It is like you are dragging rubber against rubber. There is way too much friction to actually whip anything in a pan. It definitely does not work well in a mixing bowl - there is too much friction.PROS:- Soft silicon coating on the beater will not scratch.CONS:- Beater is way too flexible. It can not be used effectively to whip any ingredients.- Silicon coating is very soft and creates a drag against any surface which it comes in contact.SUMMARY:If you are worried about scratching your pans use wooden spoons and spatulas."
2,NOT STIFF ENOUGH,"I WANTED A COATED FLAT WHISK AND ORDERED THIS ONE. IT IS NOT STIFF ENOUGH TO WHISK ANYTHING BUT LIGHT INGREDIENTS, SUCH AS EGGS. I TRIED TO USE IS FOR A STIFF CAKE BATTER AND FINALLY GAVE UP AND USED ONE OF THE REGULAR WHISKS. AM NOT SORRY THAT I PURCHASED IS BUT IT'S USES ARE LIMITED."
2,What a mess...,I have owned several versions of non-scratch whisks including this one. All have two major failings. The lessor failing is they wear out in a very short time - usually in less than a year you have metal showing through the nylon and out goes the non-scratch feature. But the worst problem with these is the designers all seem to think it important to have a heavy handle which makes in nearly impossible to keep from flipping out of the sauce pan and throwing a spray of sauce around the kitchen.After many tries I finally gave up and just let my stainless pans scratch. These whisks aren't worth the mess.
3,Short one,Had one of these previously that didn't like so many trips thru the dishwasher. Ordered this one but it is the short version and my old one was the long version. Measurements when ordering were a little deceptive. Love the product as it is the only flat silicon whisk I can find. Great for making gravy.
3,Work Book is great for preparing for the PMP Certification,The work book goes well with the text book. Professionals beware... The answers to the excercises are NOT in the work book. This is the student edition and you will need the instructor edition if you want to check your work.
1,Missing Answers : Save Your Money,"There are no ""answers"" to the questions in the book. This begs the question as why to buy a workbook with no answers. If you buy this book, think twice. Otherwise you will end up with more questions than answers.The textbook that is written by the same author is excellent however."
2,Highly Flawed Existential Characters,"I usually like the types of characters that are cast in this collection of stories: highly flawed, living out their existential lives with consequences that are just a little too obvious. But this cast of characters, as much as I like them, are not nearly as interesting as they would have been in the hands of a better writer, someone like Junot Diaz or Elizabeth Strout. And quite clearly Jason Ockert has a lot of improving to do to make it to that level. I do not recommend this collection of stories."
1,Own a different BestMed thermometer that is real junk,Bought a CVS thermometer that's made by BestMed (it says BestMed on the back) -- it's unreliable and after two days seems to have already started to break. Highly unrecommended.
1,"inaccurate, often doesnt work at all","this thermometer started working only on and off after a few days, also, gives drastically different readings one after the other. not reliable."
1,Horribly inaccurate thermometer,"It has routinely given us readings for 101 and higher for healthy individuals. For those who make decisions on whether or not to give an infant or child medication, this is a very dangerous scenario if it leads to overmedicating.Spend a little more money and get one that has a good Consumer Reports rating such as the Vick's Comfort-Flex or the Omron 20 Seconds Digital."
1,A novelty joke thermometer perhaps?,I tried to take my temperature with this thermometer and found that my temperature was 96.8F instead of 98.6F! Other members of my family have also found that it generates temperatures values on the low side. Don't buy this thermometer if you want a serious assessment of your body temperature! I pity the person who is seriously ill and is tricked into relying on this thing!
1,Unreliable and Inaccurate,"This thermometer is not worth buying. It does not give accurate readings, and there should be a way to recalibrate it, but there isn't. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.BestMed KD-192 Flexible Tip 5 Second Thermometer"
1,Very difficult to use,"This thermometer is very difficult to use. The button that changes modes rarely works, and I can almost never get the thing to take a 40 second reading."
1,A WEAK Prince Rip-off!!,This is the worse CD that I have ever purchased. The songs sound like a rip-off of Prince's music. The amature guitar playing is irrating and the lyrics are about as interesting as a headache. I understand now why this band did not go anywhere because the songs are really immature. There is nothing positive to say regarding this CD even the CD cover has a goofy picture. Do yourself a favor and by-pass this CD.
4,Not bad for a bunch of white boys!,"Great funk from some white dudes from the south. Go funkgure. Standouts - Sweet Jane,Candy and Righteous."
1,Should be ashamed,I gave it 1 star because that's the lowest they allow. This was ordered as a new item. Arrived in an obviously used box broken into 3 pieces. Contacted sell who never replied so I asked Amex to credit it and the seller sent documentation showing it had shipped as ordered. This is the worst seller and product I have ever encountered at Amazon.
1,Disappointed,"The picture that is used is NOT what you get. The nutcracker with the ""bent arms"" does not exist. False advertisement if you ask me!"
1,Lasted a week,"Stopped working/charging the computer after one week of use. The adapter has 2 sections, one going to the PC and the other to the wall outlet. The 2 sections don't hook up tightly, it's very loose. Not very good quality at all."
1,"it's the laptop, not the charger","This is the OEM charger, but it doesn't fit the DC input thing well at all, and keeps falling out, which means the stupid thing doesn't charge. It's not the fault of the seller, but of Sony for designing such an idiotic setup. I will never buy another Sony laptop, that's for sure."
2,Died. Quickly.,"Bought the laptop set a little over a year ago, and the adapter just gave out today and started ""beeping"" at me and refuses to charge anything. Apparently, this is a common problem with these adapters. For 70 dollars, I expect more than a year out of my charger."
2,Lasted 7 months,The original lasted nearly 5 years. This one lasted only 7 months. The wires broke where they connected to the plugs at the wall socket and at both ends of the adapter. It's a shoddy product but a good price.
2,wires exposed,the cord looked fine when I took it out of the box. But after a couple uses the plastic pulled away from the plug and the wires are exposed now. Looks like this was a repair that didn't stick! It is working fine though.
3,Sony VAIO PC AC Adapter,"Cord works well as far as providing power to my PC, but the end that actually plugs into computer is loose and comes out while using."
1,"Smoking hot deal, yeah right!","My power supply started to make this bubbling sound then suddenly started smoking noxious fumes about five minutes ago. I am writing this review in the few minutes I have left until my laptop dies. Thank you, sony!"
5,Needed my Sony power adapter ASAP!!,"My power adapter went out and I needed a replacement power adapter ASAP. I paid for the ""Next Day"" delivery and it was delivered as promised. I looked at other generic power adapters; however, I wanted to stay with the manufacturer of my laptop PC. Thanks Amazon!"
3,sony power supply,"Power supply was under the heading as ""by sony"" which is wasn't...it is an aftermarket...it works, but is not what I thought I was getting..."
2,Thought I was getting a genuine Sony product,"This product was advertised as a ""Genuine Sony Product"". I even looked closely at the photos where I could see it clearly said ""Sony"", not ""For Sony"". So I was surprised when it arrived and was a ""For Sony"" product. I have had these products made by other companies before and they seem to break fast. We'll see with this one. Frustrating."
3,Warning! Mistitled,"Please note: this ""first omnibus"" is *not* made up of the first three Morse novels. Last Bus to Woodstock was his first book (1975), and these are '77, '79, and '81. Confusing.... (ignore the star rating, please)"
5,Fred enjoyed it.,"I read this book to my guinea pig and he loved it. He said it was obvious that Ms. Ripper had spent some quality time around guinea pigs because the illustrations were dead on. He also thought that guinea pigs' obsession with I Spy was a secret.I would recommend Brian And Bob to anyone who is looking for a good guinea pig book. I would, however, suggest waiting until your guinea pig is old enough to deal with the separation issues which are raised in the book as they could be somewhat traumatic for younger cavies (having been a food source for many years, guinea pigs do not normally have a well developed sense of ""The Happy Ending"")."
5,Brian! Bob!,"This is a great, great story!!! We received this as a gift a number of years ago and had to replace it when the book was water damaged. Brian and Bob live in Pete's Pet Palace and play I Spy everyday--who knew guinea pigs played I Spy? It is a touching story about two best friends who are separated and then reunited. Beware, when read properly this story gets very loud at the end!"
1,"Pointless music, HORRIBLE remastering.","Raymond Scott, so often the quirky innovator, really fell flat on his face with this album. Arranged to please other people rather than himself, the music is blander than bland, failing to evoke the flavor of either rock and roll or symphonic music. A couple of tracks rise to the level of decent MOR, but not really worth the wade through the rest.The remastering for CD is a pure amateur job. Treble-heavy, with no bass, and a gee-I-can-do-hiss-removal approach to noise reduction that has left a heavy cloud of digital burbles and other artifacts over the music that is far worse than any tape hiss could possibly be. Note to whoever thinks they can remaster for CD: First, buy yourself a decent pair of headphones. Then look for something beyond the first freeware program you find that claims to do noise reduction, and learn how to set the parameters so that the result sounds like music."
5,A New York Christmas/Rob Thomas,A New York Christmas is a beautiful song. Rob has a beautiful voice and the music is magic. He is serious about the Christmas message. I only hope he will provide us with more Christmas songs.
3,Nice,"This is a very nice song, but nothing earth shattering. I'm a huge MB20/Rob Thomas fan, so I bought this for my ""collection"", but honestly that is the ONLY reason I'd listen to it. That said, I'm not a big Christmas music fan; I like old fashioned carols and find most modern Christmas music a tad cloying. This isn't cloying, but like I said, it's just nice. Ho-humbug."
2,whats the fuss????,"After reading the reviews on amazon and being a huge fan of MB20, Tabitha's secret and the amazing ""Smooth"", I thought I would download this song and give it a wee listen. Expecting it to be absolutly superb and fantastic, I found it to be quite average and definetly not as amazing as all the other reviewers are saying it is. Yes it has a nice wee message but seriously, whats so special about it?"
5,A New York City Christmas,"""A New York City Christmas"" is a beautiful song by Rob Thomas. Hopefully he'll do an entire Christmas cd soon."
5,Best Christmas song ever!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best song rob thomas has ever wrote. it is amazing and very inspirational. I listen to it even when its not christmas. Words can't describe how great this cd is!!!!
2,Careful what you order,"The description of this CD matches a different CD with the same title. ""Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings"" is synthesized orchestral music composed by Mickey Simmonds. The CD with the De Meij and Bilik symphonies for wind band showcase the Dutch Military Band, whose name appears on the cover. Somehow these two CDs have been linked on the website and have the same reviews. If you are expecting De Meij or Bilik, and get Simmonds instead, you will be very disappointed.The Dutch Military Band is a good group, but I didn't enjoy the recording as much as the one by the US Marine Band. For my taste, the recording mics seem a little far from the group and pick up too much of the hall. I'd give them 4 stars.The Simmonds CD is really a set of 3 discs and if you enjoy descriptive synth orchestra music, you want the CD with the picture of big rocks at the ocean shore. I'd give the Simmonds music 2 stars because it's not really my thing."
5,Russell: My Lucifer,"This book was a pleasure to read. Like the two previous volumes, Lucifer was an enlightenment. The evoultion of the ""lightbearer"" becomes more exciting as Russell progresses to the modern age. This volume, focusing on the Middle Ages, solitifies some philisophical beliefs of evil, matter and its representation in literature(specifically Dantes Inferno). I strongly recommend picking up this book(and reading it)."
1,Junk.,"Was excited to try this but after 3 weeds during its very first use, the piece of junk broke. One of the two little side bars that is attached at the very bottom that goes up through the top piece broke right off at the solder point. Used it as directed and everything."
4,"Light, but entertaining retro-show with lots of laughs","This is a great video that is a blast to watch. My three youngest children (6, 7, and 12) love it, too. It's got all levels of humor, with some ""out of date jokes (related to that era only),"" but it is still very funny. The acting is not the best, but it appears that some of it was intentional. Sledge Hammer is an awesome series, and all the videos should be on DVD. There has never been a comedy quite like it. A Comedy version of Dirty Harry. It's raw, 80's, and innexpensively done, but it is still worth owning. I'm glad I bought it and hope to eventually have the whole series. If you like movies like ""Raising Arizona,"" or Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you will most likely enjoy this series, too."
5,Worth Buying,"Preforms exactly as advertised. This is a high quality toy from a toy company with a good reputation. Fits Snap 'n Style Dolls, the Snap N' Style Dolls includes several pieces of snap on clothes (extra clothes like this Bedtime fasions set are sold separately). These dolls and clothes make a great toy especially for young girls ages 2-4. Each Doll can wear other Snap `n Style doll clothes, or the fasions clothes sets ...so play expands by mixing and matching with each new set. The Snap N' Style Fashion Wardrobe that Fisher Price makes to go with these dolls might be a nice accessory cost retail around $20.00.Cons:When moving the dolls arms, the doll's snap on top can dislodge. Snap on clothes only cover the front of the doll; the rear of the doll and it's painted on underwear is still visible.(....)"
4,Krussel Always good,"this is my 3rd purchase from Krussel. they are just about the only cases that consistently fit well, are not bulky or ugly."
1,Avoid,After one use this stuff clouded my water. It definitely wasn't by over feeding since I used the smallest pinch to see if my fish liked it. Avoid.
2,"Very basic, but well put together","This book is simply two forms: one for the straight sword, and one for the Chinese broadsword. Without any pretense, this book dives first into the straight sword (jin) form, then immediately goes into the broadsword (dao) form. Normally that would constitute very little, but the illustrations are excellent and arrows make understanding the movements very easy."
1,Burgandy parchment Shade,"My initial reaction to the shades I ordered was very positive. They werebeautiful and seemed to be well made, however; after about three weeksthe parchmant started to pull away from the top of the shade. Almost likeit was melting off or shrinking! Unfortunately I have misplaced the receipt and the shipping box has been tossed so I now have a melted shadeon my office desk untill I can physically go and find a replacement."
2,Only two librarians could write such a boring book on such an interesting subject,"Yes, a scholarly book, with illustrations. Yawn. If you seek anything more than research and the occasional black and white illustration, look elsewhere. I'm sure the authors are being ""celebrated"" within their communities, but the hype is just that; hype. The cover of the book is the only colorful, exciting thing about it.Not that I was expecting a cookbook, but it does not appeal to a wide range of people, and that is a flaw. The authors therefore come across as if they must be glad to be part of such an ""elite"" group of people who ""get it,"" while the rest of us are simply ignorant.Also, this is definitely not for the foodies."
3,From TMPress Features,"When the small band of separatists from the Church of England whom we call the Pilgrims arrived at Cape Cod in November 1620, they entered an abundant land. `America's Founding Food' explores the history and the recipes that have served as the basis for New England dishes and recipes."
4,"Great machine, despite unreliable transmission",I had this drill and it's a great machine on all parts except the badly engineered transmission.I know have the BHP458z. It has a far better transmission which you can rely on.I think Makita stopped making this 3-speed machine due to it's unreliability and they have now gone back to using only 2 gears in their machines. I guess we have to wait a little while longer for a 3-speed gearbox that can be relied on.
5,sweet drill,"I pretty much agree with all the positive comments and minor caveats in the reviews, to date. I've always liked the Makita products in comparison to Milwaukee or Dewalt: better feel in the hand and outstanding balance makes it feel even lighter than it already is.Only neg so far: lowest clutch setting is a little too much for lightweight drywall.Within what it's built for, this one does not disappoint."
4,Transmission Problems,"I have used three of the Makita BDF451s in my home furniture and cabinet business for three years now, and they are great drills to use. Just need to be a little tougher. I used to own a commercial cabinet shop and must have heavy-duty tools, as I demand a lot from them. I concur with what others have said about power, balance, the very helpful light, quick charge time, etc. But now, two of the three drills have developed transmission problems. The problem starts with 3rd gear (gears slipping, popping out of gear). Eventually, all gears are affected. The motors run just as powerfully as the day I bought them, and battery endurance is likewise still great. But the drills make horrible gear grinding sounds now, and power no longer gets to the chuck. I would give 5 stars if Makita made a tougher transmission."
5,Makita BDF451 LXT drill,The drill has performed flawless. It has great power and battery life. The only thing I wish it would be about one pound lighter but the trade off is worth it.
2,cd scratched,In the beginning the music was great then I go worst and worst. It was scratchy when I played it on my itouch. So buy at your own caution
5,Survey course in Mathematics text,"This text was used in a survey course in mathematics for non-math/science majors. It reviews the development of thought from arithmetic reasoning to algebra as generalized arithmatic,expands algebra to include exponents and scientific notation, logarithms, then geometry and trigonometry.Applications are used. The concept of functions is introduced so that the user can understand the concept and the necessity for functions. The mathematics of investment is used to illustrate the use of series and progressions. An entire chapter is used to explain each concept in this text for first year college students.One of the objects of the text is to show that many fundamental ideas of mathematics have their sources in physical experience. It is a strong argument for the acceptance of thinking based on mathematical concepts aimed toward the ""math hater"",the easily overwhelmed, the arts and history major, and most of all the MBA types."
5,Great! Heavy duty,"I have the Calphalon professional line, and recently purchased this set of bakeware. I am very impressed. Even cooking, and strong, ridged pans. Never flex or bend in the oven. I even forgot to grease the pan, and nothing stuck. That's my idea of a good pan.But, like all of Calphalon's non-stick line, these are not dishwasher safe. Be sure to read the included owners manual next time!"
1,Great for first use ONLY. Not dishwasher safe.,"These are heavy, sturdy-looking pans that I enjoyed cooking with... once. After popping one into the dishwasher, I pulled it out and was greeted by a splash of brown, rusty water all over my floor and pants.The side lip of all these pans are curled over, leaving space for water to get trapped. The metal in this crevace must not be treated with *any* kind of coating, because it rusts very, very quickly.It's a shame, because they would have been quite nice pans."
3,Not Dostoyevskys Best,These two stories do not impress me. They are not near the best of Dostoyevesky. Stick to the longer novels of Dostoyevsky to see why he is considered one of the greatest writers in history.
5,"Good Book, nicely bound","Nice binding, good size print. I love books that are 2-in-1 like this.Also I like the built-in book-mark."
3,nice protection for lens,I use this to wrap my DSLR in when placed in my daypack. It protects it and works well to give it a little cushion.
4,See storylines above,"Weinberger and Schweizer have put together a novel that is definitely fast and highly entertaining, with enough thrills to please most thriller fans. The only slight drawback was that the plot seemed just a little farfetched, though it was fun to read.Recommended for the thrills"
2,Same old story,"You could figure this book out after the first 10 pages. It reads like Brad Thor's ""The Lions of Lucerne"" except Brad book was first and better.While this was not a terrible book, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking for something new."
2,mp3,this would be OK if it did not have a rechargeable battery in it. must be charged on your computor
3,Not that great,"This is an OK version and I do applaud those publishers that are reprinting the Latin writers in the original Latin. However, I do not alway like the editions they choose to reprint. They tend to cheapen the product by using small type -- it is in no way comparable to the original edition which they are copying. This same edition is also one of the books scanned by Google and can be downloaded for free from their web site. At least by printing it yourself you have come control over the size of the font."
3,Coast 2 Coast Readers Review,"""Change Don't Always Come"" when you want it to... the saga continues and Jaylin is still playin' games with the women in is life. Will he keep stringin' Scropio along like a puppet or will she wake up and get her self together... Nokea has flipped the game and now she is playin the game that got played on her. Will she be as good at it as Jaylin or will she get played again. The third time is a charm and Brenda M. Hampton has did this series of books well. Avid reader will love all three of this trilogy. [...]"
4,currently reading this,"I am currently reading this book right now....and it is soooo full of drama! And I love it! I swear Jaylin just doesn't quit with all of these women,but these women never get enough of him. No matter what he does to them, or how bad he hurts them--they keep coming back to him for more! Like Jaylin is gonna up and change one day. YEAH RIGHT!"
1,Choose something else,This book bears only the slightest similarity to the Ignatian spiritual exercises. Especially bad was the examination of conscience. It is assumed that the wife is not competent to handle money and does not have the right to make decisions; that privilege rests with the husband. The general tone of the book relates more to 19th century family life than to 21st century family life. There are many good books on Ignation Spirituality. Choose one of them. Forget this one.
5,Great coffee - Great price,"I drink more coffee than anyone I know. I HAVE to have at least two cups a day or I am very unstable. I have a HomeCafe system and this coffee can be expensive, but on Amazon it is cheap and comes quick. It also has a great taste and I don't even have to go to the store - it's delivered straight to my place. Anyone with a pod machine knows these pods can be pricey - your best bet is to order them online here."
5,Bahamas Flyfishing Bible,"This is not only the definitive flyfishing guide to the Bahamas, but also (i) a very insightful book on logistics and non-fishing pursuits on the islands; and (ii) one of the finest fishing guides written for any area in the world, which is an especially great accomplishment given the span of the area. Read to plan, or just read to dream. Essential for anyone deciding on which island to go to, and which areas to fish. My only complaint? -- that I personally wasn't able to help research this book by visiting/fishing all areas covered."
1,Waste of time and money,I found this book while searching the web for Bahamas fishing information. The website for the book touts Stephen and Kim Vletas as a great resource for information about fishing the Bahamas. I tried the email addresses they gave on their webiste and they never bothered to reply. I mailed them a check to purchase the book which they never responded to or mail me my book. Another charge for me to cancel the check! I even contacted Kim by phone who promised to return my call with much needed information but she never bothered. There is nothing in this book that isn't readily available on the web. Don't waste your money on this book and more importantly don't waste your time trying to get any useful information from these people.
4,mmmmm,the best dry seasoning I've used. can't understand why the area stores only stock the bbq flavor and not this.. wake up KC Masterpiece people
5,What will I do...down to last shaker!,"I love this steak seasoning on ribeye steaks, pork chops and chicken. I can't find it in the store anymore. I ordered a case of it from Amazon last year...I am anxiously awaiting notification of the availability of this product on Amazon....I can't believe KC Masterpiece isn't mass producing this stuff! It is so delicious!"
2,Disappointed,"I have read seven other books by Stephen Frey - all seven excellent. ""The Successor"" is my number eight. Why would someone who obviously knows the financial world inside and out and writes so well about it jump into the subjects he is clueless about? Politics? Very weak."
2,Lame,You know the plot is okay but the author has this incredibly annoying habit of having to explain the background of every previous paragraph. I couldn't even finish this book because of it. This was my first book by Frey; I picked it up at the airport. I really believe he thinks his readers are stupid.
3,The Cuban story is a little too much,I am a huge fan of Mr Frey. I read every book and enjoy the Christian Gillette and Everest story line. But this whole deal with a government overthrow in Cuba is too much. I hope the next book is about finance and thrills not politics! Two of my favorite characters are out.. Q is body guard dies and Gillette retires..
2,Nothing to remember,"This book supposedly has to do with economy, politics, ideology, and such. I couldn't find any of them in this book. I like that author introduced us about his view on Cuban history and society. That was the best part of the book. However, in my opinion the plot was contrived and far fetched at best if not simply a conjured up non sense. Still, the worst part of the book would be lack of emotional and psychological depth in characters. They never came out of two dimension. So basically this book was readable but had nothing to do with nothing. I couldn't find anything to remember about this book."
2,Learn to Finish,"It seems that Mr Frey got burnt out with his own novel as he got to the climax. It concluded so abruptly, completely abbreviating the ending and lacking a meaningful resolution. I won't spoil, but the way things are concluded with a few charaters leaves the reader with an unsatisfied, empty feeling.Mr. Frey can write the first 80% of a novel fairly well (a poor man's Robert Ludlum is still entertaining), but he has got to figure out how to write the last 20%."
2,Get back to finance!!,"I read the book in two days because I've read most of Frey's books but I don't like the politics story. Too far fetched. I thought the series was getting a little off track in the last book. Frey needs to stick to finance power books. I also hated to see Gillette become such a dumbass, wimp. Get back to the days of Protege!!"
2,Redux,"I liked the first few Frey novels of high finance and the people who deal with money - good and especially the bad, but now I have the feeling that I am re-reading the same book over and over. The writing is adequete, and the characters are interesting, but sorry to say it seems to be the same plot over and over. The author has come to a point where he needs to stretch a little more or risk losing his audience."
2,Disappointing,"This book continues the downward spiral of the Christian Gillette series, unfortunately. It started out with so much promise in ""The Chairman"", but this book effectively demonstrates that this storyline is on life-support. I mean - honestly - Christian Gillette hired by the president as part of a plot to restore order to Cuba after an American action to overthrow their government? I didn't realize Vince Flynn was a ghost-writer for Stephen Frey!The way the book was written, it's almost as if the author even knew that he extended this series too far, which is why I look forward to a much better follow-up."
1,"Frey, please get back on track!","Having thoroughly enjoyed all of Mr. Frey's excellent financial thrillers I was sadly disappointed with the SUCCESSOR. The characters are not credible and the plot implausible. (It's almost as if this book was written early on and not fit for printing, but, with the success of all the others just thrown in to make a few bucks.Let us hope the author gets back on track; he has provided all of us many hours of excellent diversion."
4,more funny penguins!,Bought this as a gift for a friend. She liked it and has had no problems with it. Would recommend to friends.
3,Took me a while to like it,"The beginning was okay.It took me some time to get into the cartoon and enjoy it. I'm not really much into penguins of madagascar. And it's not the whole 2 hours movie, but a collection of mini series,ca 10 mins each."
3,"Not an entire movie - just short ""adventures""","We loved Madagascar and the humor of the Penguins so I thought this would be great. However, I misunderstood how they put the DVD together - it is a bunch of short adventures."
1,Buyer beware! This is not a complete season of episodes.,I purchased this dvd believing it to contain all of season one's episodes. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered it only had a sampling of episodes and a few that had not yet aired. I enjoy this show but doubt I'll buy anything from Nickelodeon again simply out of principle.
5,killer record!!!,"i'm beginning to suspect that the overly harsh reviews of this record are fueled by old fans' disagreement with fogerty's outspoken POLITICAL views more than anything else. this is an awesome record. I *love* this record! it's all about fogerty's voice...one of my top 5 in rock n roll EVER. the best is the title track. if you like CCR, jf solo, or music in general, you WILL dig this record!!!"
2,sorry,"I understand that fans want to love everything Fogerty does, cause I'm a fan and I do as well. But this is repetitive and inferior stuff."
5,Deja Vu,This is a great CD. I bought this just for one song~Sugar Sugar. After listening to it I love all the songs!!
3,"""Swamp"" Is a Tough Act to Follow","I consider ""Blue Moon Swamp"" one of the finest rock albums of all time. Perhaps, John Fogarty's new effort would not be so disappointing if I weren't comparing it to his previous masterpiece. Unfortunately, the two discs must be compared and ""Deva Vu..."" suffers. I don't think there is a truly memorable song in the whole bunch; in fact, all of the tunes either border on the pedestrian or sound simply derivitive. Fogarty did not enter the groover's pantheon with this kind of mediocrity; let us hope he'll return with something more up to his high standards."
2,What happened?,"Did anyone at Geffen Records actually LISTEN to this collection before giving it the thumbs-up? Could someone not have said, ""John! We gave you seven years, and THIS is what you deliver?"" I am giving it a maximum of two stars out of genuine goodwill. I'm a lifelong Fogerty fan, and I admire his body of work. But this CD ranges from blatant copies of his earlier songs, to repetitious tuneless pop. With all due respect, Fogerty's fans who counted down the days to this release are owed an apology."
2,what exactly is the point..,"After several decades of entertaining it's obvious that Fogerty doesn't have much to say anymore. The songs I listened to, only six of them before I ejected the disc, are predictable and mediocre. Kudos for the musicianship, but I'll stick with a few CCR discs and ""Centerfield."""
1,I love old CCR but this CD is not very good,"Seven years between albums and this is the best Mr. Fogerty can come up with? I would be hard pressed to pick more than one, much less two songs, off this CD for any homemade complilation disc. I read a few reviews today before picking this up and wasn't expecting much but I really like most everything John Fogerty has done in the past so I took a chance on it. Needless to say, it's much worse than I was even prepared for. I figured if half the songs were decent than it'd be worth it, but sorry to say, that's not the case at all here. John Fogerty may be in a happy place in his life and good for him. It just doesn't translate into very interesting music I'm afraid. Don't be fooled by all the four and five star Fogerty slappy reviews, this disc isn't worth the price of admission. Save your money and pick up a copy of Centerfield, Blue Moon Swamp, or any CCR disc you might not already own."
1,Seven Years For This?,"It's been seven years since John Fogerty released the excellent 'Blue Moon Swamp' and the thought that kept going through my head as I listened to this CD for the first time was ""It took him 7 years to come up with this mess?"" There are certainly some good songs on the CD...the title track is a catchy, poignant and melodic song that sounds exactly like CCR, which is not a bad thing. But songs such as 'Radar' and ""She Got Baggage' are simply horrible - like something a band of 13 year olds would come up with in their garage. Even the songs that are musically pleasing ('Honey Do' 'I Will Walk With You' 'Nobody Here Anymore') are filled with the type of inane lyrics you would expect from a teenager, not the creator of 'Fortunate Son.' If it is taking John Fogerty 7 years to comeup with this type of music and lyrics, he might want to give it up now."
4,john fogerty deja vu all over again,this cd does not stand up to his earlier solo projects but to hard core fans we can forgive the few shortfalls here. more of a rockin country feel to it that will probably appeal to most fans.
3,"Too much ""All Over Again""","There's half a good-to-great collection here but the weaker songs really drag this down. The title song, She's Got Baggage, Wicked Old Witch, and especially Nobody's Here Anymore (hearing Fogerty channeling Mark Knofler's vocals to Knofler's fret work was fun) are great compliments and even extension of John Fogerty's previous work. As for the rest, it would have been worth the wait of another couple of years while he came up with a few more and better songs."
5,John still satisfies,"How fortunate we are that John still chooses to enrich our lives with his music. How many of the old rockers are kickin, much less writing? The title song ""Deja Vu All Over Again"" is Iraq's answer to Vietnam's ""Fortunate Son."" The rest of the music shows he's happy with his wife and young children. Good for you, John. You don't have to apologize to me for being happy and content with your life. Keep on rockin John, I love you!"
5,Great Stuff,"Another classic CD by John Fogerty. This man is a marvel in the way he can delve into many diverse musical styles and come up with songs that are truly his own but sound like they have always been around. Every song on this CD is well-crafted, hook-laden, and catchy. After a couple of listens you'll be humming them and hearing them in your head over and over. Rather than rehash Blue Moon Swamp or CCR, Fogerty sounds very fresh, and the singing and playing is first rate. The softer acoustic songs will open up a whole new audience and be well received by women, particularly as they are about them! The title song gives me goosebumps with its evocative lyrics, but is typically Fogerty-like in the way it doesn't preach. The more I listen to this CD the more I like it, and the more convinced I am that Mr Fogerty is in a league of his own when it comes to singing, songwriting, and musicianship and contribution to popular music."
4,Stop and think about the title song!,"This is not Fogerty""s best effort. I am a loyal fan. It is growing on me. It doesn't have that hard edge, but it is still what I consider good. The title song is haunting for those of us who lived through the wasteland of Viet Nam. When you understand the""Wall"" is the one in D.C., you better understand his message. This is not ""Fortunate Son"", but a very powerful statement of what is going on right now with Iraq. I pray his vision is false, but know better. Buy the CD just for this song."
3,Not His Best,I'll make this a short review. There are 3 or 4 good songs on this cd and the rest are pretty much duds. This is not John Fogertys best work. If your a strong fan you may want it for the few good songs. If your just parousing for what John Fogerty record to try this isn't the one. Overall it's pretty weak.
2,Lackluster,"I was expecting more from this release. The songs stake out a middle ground: some good, a few forgettable, the rest passable. I was a huge fan of CCR in the late 60's and early 70's and had the memorable experience of seeing them live at the Forum in 1971 (after Tom Fogerty had left). I also saw John at the Fillmore in the late 90's after he came out of retirement. I can't expect J.C. to keep playing swamp rock. It's just that I wish he would have mixed in a bit of the bayou and some straight-ahead rock 'n roll for old times' sake. That being said, I remain a believer in the man and his music."
1,Tedious Familiarity All Over Again,I am a life long fan of CCR and John Fogerty but this is definitely one to avoid. There is only one good song - the title track. The rest is a mixture of familar CCR riffs and immediately forgettable country/folk/rock influenced songs with absolutely terrible lyrics. Mark Knopfler plays the Sultans Of Swing riff in the background on one track and that was probably the lowpoint of the album. Even John's thoughts on today's world are immature and unoriginal. Listen to Don Henley or Jackson Browne. I wanted to like the album but after repeated listenings it actually gets worse.
2,Uggh!,"Maybe two good songs including the title track, but the rest is very weak. I can't bear to listen to this again. I will remain a fan of his earlier work, but this effort is extremely disappointing."
1,It's just bad,"Where can I start talking about how dissapointed I am with this album. The title track, although slightly copying ""Who Will Stop the Rain"", was fairly good....I've never been more disgusted than when I heard the gut-wrenchingly bad Ramones rip-off ""She's Got Baggage"". Only the title track, ""I will walk with you"" and ""Wicked Old Witch"" (which I liked the first time......when it was called ""Green River"" sound like John Fogerty, and lyrically, all of the other songs on this album are some of the most shallow and vapid things I've ever heard the man produce.Considering Blue Moon Swamp was the album that inspired me to play guitar, I feel horribly let down by this album"
4,New Fogerty is Pleasing,"OK, I will admit up front I'm a Fogerty fan since the Hoover administration, but Deja Vu is one fine little CD.Sugar Sugar will delight all -- it's the CD's highlite. Fogerty's flat picking on that tune is very admirable. His guitar playing just keeps improving and improving.I will walk with you in another excellent tune that all will love. A nice love song to his daughter with some great dobro work from Jerry Douglas of Alison Kraus and Union Station fame.He even throws in his ""swamp rock"" signature tune on ""Wicked Witch."" Good tune that will probably get some airplay this coming halloween.The ending tune....In the Garden....weak. I have no idea what he is talking about and the song doesn't work for me.But, all in all, 4 out of 5."
4,Hard to believe he's 59!,"It was definitly worth the 7 year wait! First let me say, I did'nt give it 5 stars because It's almost impossible to give anything a perfect score, but this comes close. Sugar, Sugar and Wicked Old Witch are my favorites. I can't say I dislike any of the tunes on the album, they all sound great. John sounds great and sounds like he is having a blast! I guess I'll listen to the cd for the 4th time today and play Wicked Old Witch extra loud! It sounds awesome!"
4,The Vietnam Iraq connection,"Fogerty creates a short masterpiece here. The title cut completes the connection between his Vietnam classics ""Fortunate Son"" and ""Who'll Stop the Rain"" and his present concern about our involvement in the Middle East. But this would be well meaning but for naught if Fogerty didn't bring his musical A game. My only problem with this album is that it should be at least two songs longer . I guess there is just no pleasing me. This is a must buy."
4,Short Sweet and To The Point,"If you like John C. Fogerty / CCR then you will like this CD. If you don't, then nothing on this disc will change your mind. Saw this man in concert in KC in 2006 with Willie Nelson and he puts on a good show. The title track and Nobody's Here Anymore are vintage Fogerty and are the two best tracks on the disc. The rest are good for any Fogerty fan. My only complaint is that the disc is too short."
2,1 great song-rest forgettable,"There is no doubt that the title track is exceptional and about as good anyhting Fogerty has ever recorded. However, the rest of the Cd is just bland. By no means are the remaining nine songs lousy, just instantly forgettable. While I think this release will please Fogerty fans, I doubt the typical listener will enjoy more than the 1st song on this so-so album."
1,one good song,This cd has only one good song. Definitely not worth the full price and a disappointment for a long time Fogerty fan.
5,Refreshing Fogerty,Hey they can't be all Voodoo stuff. This is a fun album. Too bad he got sucked into the liberal camp with the first tune. JF is one of the last of the great American rockers. Hope he doesn't go into hibernation again.
2,Dear John,"Is it just me or is this an experiment of some sort to see if John still has what it takes? Aside from Rhubarb Pie and Wicked Old Witch I found the fare to be bland at best, lacking the fullness of Johns previous work both solo and with CCR. Not to demean John's guitar work in any way but who is he trying to be? I could swear I heard Clapton and Knopfler in there. That driving beat that was CCR is missing and I think that's what the real fans were looking for. In any case John you still get E for effort."
2,Deja Vu Misses the Mark,"This record is a MAJOR disappointment. John is showing his age by recording mostly insipid acoustic disasters incorporated with unusually shallow lyrics. The album's highlight is Wicked Old Witch which is the only song that comes close to what we would normally expect from John, but then the poor arrangement (the song is far too short) ruins it. Unless you are a die-hard fan, do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this half-hearted effort. For you die-hards (myself included), we just have to shake our heads and wonder how an artist with John's ability can spend seven years working on a record and still have it come out sounding like this."
2,Only 'cause I remember when,"I would have thought J.C. would have grown up by now, with his immature political views. That being said, What's up with this 35 minutes, for $15-20 Crap?!? Wonder why people are pirating music on the internet? There's your answer!!The songs on this CD wouldn't even make good b-sides of Creedence singles. It's very sad to see my inspiration to be a singer decline like this. With any luck, sales will suck so bad, it'll wake him up. He'll get more chances, because he's politically correct, so we may get more good music out of him.We can only pray. (OOPS! Didn't mean to mention God!)"
4,"Not ""Blue Moon Swamp"" but................","Anyone expecting another ""Blue Moon Swamp"" will be disappointed but overall this is a very good CD. It is the most country music oriented John Fogerty recording since ""Blue Ridge Rangers"" and as such is more laid back than many of his more rock oriented efforts. ""Deja Vu (All Over Again)"", ""Honey Do"", ""Nobody's Here Anymore"", and ""Wicked Old Witch"" are the standouts in my opinion but all of the songs are vintage John Fogerty. It is great that there are a few of the masters from the golden age of rock n roll still out there recording new music and touring."
2,Pathetic!,"I love Creedence, and love John's solo music.HOWEVER, this is a total piece of s***. Devu Ju is trying to tie the Iraq war to Vietinam, but sounds like a whining coward afraid of standing up to a bully. Honey Do is just plain stupid, and none of the songs stand out.This is a guy who's written dozens of the greatest songs in our lives, and this is the best he can do? Pathetic!"
3,Disappointment after such a long recording hiatus.,"I love CCR and John Fogerty but Deja Vu All Over Again is probably the worst of Fogerty's post CCR efforts. The album isn't horrible, just lightweight; there's nothing remotely remarkable or memorable here and nothing that will create new fans for Fogerty.What's particularly disappointing is that this is all he could come up in seven years. Hope the next one's better."
3,"John ""Mellow"" Fogerty","I own, or have at one time owned every sound recording that was available by John Fogerty. In my opinion, Springsteen, Dylan, and Fogerty are the top three Rock Songwriters of all time. That said, the only reason that I gave this effort three stars instead of two is because I am such a big fan of JC Fogerty.Besides the title track ( a great song! ), there isn't a whole lot of energy or ""chooglin"" goin' on here. When Fogerty does his best stuff, you want to hear it over and over automatically. Besides Deja Vu, and maybe ""Honey Do"", that ain't happenin' hear. Too bad. I wish I could say that this is a great cd, but it's not."
4,"More Fun, Less Serious","This is the year 2004, not 1969, so I don't think it is fair to make a value comparison between John Fogerty now and the John Fogerty from 35 years ago. Times have changed, and John has changed. I think it is more useful and appropriate to focus on his modern work. That said, this collection of songs is different from any other collection he has ever released as a solo artist. John is a family man now, and my feeling is that he is more content with the world around him. Aside from cell phones and the invasion of Iraq, he seems pretty happy about life. His music and lyrics demonstrate this. The title song is sad, dark, and reflective. From there, the songs are mostly upbeat, and less intense. He even lets his young daughter pipe in on one of the songs. I like this collection of songs. I admit, it's not my ""new favorite"" but the songs have really grown on me. It's great to have you back, John."
2,Is this a joke?,"I would really like to subscribe to this, and perhaps I will, but like previous posters have said, how in the world do they come up with pricing that is MORE THAN the printed version ??!You can subscribe to the printed version for 60 bucks for 2 years and that comes out to 2.50 a month. Come on Amazon get real on this.This should cost NO MORE THAN 2 bucks a issue.Bob"
1,Authoritarian to the extreme,"I used to read the paperback version of Analog which I enjoyed very much. One of the reasons that I bought a Kindle is to read Analog. Although the Kindle format is great, I am extremely disappointed in the degeneration of Analog content. It's editorials have taken an extreme authoritarian bent - hackers are evil, always obey the government, you need to give up civil liberties so you can be protected from the other etc. The story quality is poor as well. Thanks to Kindle, I have discovered Light Speed magazine which contains much higher quality stories. I can highly recommend Light Speed magazine as an antidote to the poor writing, extreme authoritarian bent and incoherent editorials of Analog."
1,Absurd Price!!!,"$5.99 per month, without images. This is obsurd. I can buy analogue on the news stand cheaper. Hell, I can subscribe for $72/year in the US and have it forwarded to Canada for a fraction of the price. This is just absurd pricing."
1,Back issues?,"Wow - they really make this difficult, don't they. I want to buy the back issues with the David R Palmer story in them. I emailed the publisher and they don't answer - Amazon doesn't seem to have the option. This should be one of the great advantages of ebooks!"
5,Ignore the old reviews. New formatting makes it great,"I *almost* passed on subscribing to Analog on the Kindle. So many of the older reviews gave a poor impression of the digital edition, largely because of horrible formatting and a lack of table of contents. However, I kept on reading (and reading) the existing reviews, and to my great pleasure I found that Analog now uses the more-or-less standard layout and TOC as other digital Kindle publications. Now that these issues have been resolved, I am a satisfied subscriber.On a related note, if you like Analog, Asimov's is also available in an updated format. Sadly, the The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction is missing. Of the big three remaining digests, I'd like to see it represented here most of all."
1,Worst Kindle Content Ever,"I tried this for several months and finally gave up and cancelled it. The publisher has done probably the worst job of rendering their publication for the Kindle that can be imagined. The articles don't start on new page boundaries. The table of contents is sometimes there, sometimes not, and is not linked to the Kindle popup menu. Basically there's no way to read the magazine but to start at the beginning and page through it in sequence from the beginning to the end. Don't waste your money."
1,A complete rip-off,"As a UK Kindle 2 user the price for this Analog is $6, which is about TWICE the price it costs me to get the print publication sent to me on subscription from the States.Why do Amazon think it is reasonable to rip Kindle 2 users off who don't live in the US. When I bought the 'International' version nobody at Amazon mentioned that we'd be ripped off big time, and have to pay 100%, and sometime more, than US users, and more than it would cost to get the physical product.It is a shame as I do like my Kindle, but it leaves a VERY sour taste in my mouth that we're being taken advantage of, to such an extent.Shame on you Amazon!"
3,"good content, not so good navigation",Just to much of a pain to navigate around the magazine. Why not have a quick menu button to see all the articles? (Like the SF Chronicle)? Instead of pushing the back button repeatedly to get to the table of contents.
5,Great stories!,"Amazing scifi stories, wich make you think about how things work today and how they can be better done./Best regards Peter R.K. Öst"
1,Very disappointed,I would think that a magazine that embraces the future would be more in tune with ebook technology. There was no table of contents. No way to go to the next article or story without hitting next page repeatedly.
3,"Price has been fixed, how about bookmarks",It's a dollar more than buying the paper copy at a magazine stand and 1.25 more per month than having it mailed to Canada from Analog. Update May 2012-- It appears that DELL Magazines/Amazon has listened to all the complaints and matched the U.S. price for us Canadian subscibers. I am currently subscibing but am unhappy about the lack of abillity to bookmark a page in the current format. As soon as the nook software is available to Canadian customers I will switch my subcription to get the bookmark feature.
1,Overpriced,"No other way to put it, this is grossly overpriced. It's much more expensive than a standard subscription.I can understand that maybe Dell is doing this intentionally, because if everyone dumped their paper subscriptions for the kindle version, they'd have trouble making ends meet for the remaining print subscribers. Maybe it's just doomed to fail anyhow.I suppose that puts me in the terrible position of hoping the print circulation drops enough that they have to drop paper subscriptions entirely, and switch to the lower-cost e-publishing distribution method. Maybe then the price will come down to something reasonable."
1,Can't get if using Kindle for iPad,"I tried purchasing Analog using Kindle on my iPad. I got the message that I must have a Kindle to purchase this. To lock content like this to only your device seems to be a poor business decision. I'm not going to buy another (limited) reading device for one type of content. Amazon, do you want to sell content or do you want to sell hardware? You seem to be doing a poor job at doing both."
2,Overpriced and delayed delivery killed my interest,"I've been a subscriber to the paper version of Analog for many years and love the magazine. However, my 3 year subscription to the paper version only cost me $86. The Kindle subscription would cost me $36/year or $107.64!!! This is $21 MORE than my paper subscription. If the price were more like $2.00/month, I'd get it ($72/3 years).Then, the delivered issue was the May 1st issue when I'd just read the June issue. A one month delay did not excite me at all and has been mentioned by other reviewers.I'd really like to have all my magazines on my Kindle. BUT, I will not be sc....d over on the price and delivery. Amazon can do without this sale.PS: Love the 14 day trial periods. This was just a bad choice."
5,"Translation, Physics and Facts of the Matter","It is manifestly obvious that Prof. Gibson has a knack for appreciating what Quine is up to in Quine's beautiful if somewhat enigmatic prose. Gibson's essay ""Translation, Physics and Facts of the Matter"" from the Schillp volume dedicated to Quine demonstrates that Gibson appreciates Quine's fundamental committment to the best physical science of the day. This helps to distinguish the indeterminacy of translation from the more general underdetermination of empirical theory, a distinction that apparently eluded Chomsky for an extended period of exchanges between himself and Prof. Quine. Gibson is to be regarded as a spectacular expositor of Quine's philosophy, and this work is surely an instance."
5,Still wonderful after 60 years!,"I was so delighted to see, completely by chance, that this book is still in print and being read so many years after it was written. Helen Fine was my teacher for many years and made religious school and Hebrew School classes interesting and fun. We were so thrilled to be in her class as everyone had read G'dee - a real, live author was going to be our teacher! When she wrote her second book, Camp KeeTov, she put us all in there and read us the galley proofs as they came back from the publisher. G'dee is a wonderful story for kids of all ages. If you read this as a child, read it to your child. It is a timeless story of Jewish family life and celebrations, in terms even young children can understand. It's a simple book - a pure delight."
2,Funny and Cute,"The title of the book comes from a bet that Nick Hastings makes with his best friend Ethan that they'll both find a bride by midnight, and within the next 30 days. Nick meets Amanda Van Patton and quickly convinces her to marry him. But, although he has the bride he doesn't have the marriage in the more traditional sense. Amanda discovers the bet Nick made and their marriage turns from one of possible happiness to avoidance and unwillingness to be together. Their relationship is actually funny and Amanda isn't the typical Harlequin female - she has a brain and a sharp wit and uses both. This book is far from great, but it provides some entertainment and is slightly better (and longer) than the average Harlequin. The book cover says it's a Harlequin Western, but it's not at all western."
5,"Great book, great island","We are planning our first trip to Hawaii and have been amazed on the amount of information that is out there. This book summarizes all of the hawaiian islands and helped us plan our 3 week trip. It reviews not only hotels, but restaurants, activities and hot spots to see. All for less than $20! I feel that it is a must for any traveler to the island."
4,Great for keeping foods or marinating small quantities,"I have a few of the foodsaver containers, and use them for both food storage and marinating. The smaller containers are great for small portions of food or for one person. For food storage, I used them primarily for foods that I know I won't use for a couple of days. I have had no problems with cracking, but I don't use the containers in the freezer, and I wash them by hand. I gave them 4 stars because they are not good for storage of foods that you might use in portions. Each time the container is opened, it has to be sealed again for the remainder of the contents. This means pulling out the Foodsaver sealing unit which is often inconvenient.These containers would be very useful for someone that packs a lunch to take to work. They would keep sandwiches or salads very fresh until lunchtime."
3,Read my other review,"I have rated the food saver containers. They are ok, but after a while... the lid ribs crack, and they won't hold a seal."
3,A lot smaller then I expected,I cook a two weeks worth of food and store half in the freezer and half in the fridge. I figured I could use these to store some. Id have to get about 18 of these packages and I dont have that kind of money. Looked bigger in the picture. Oh well will store some of it anyways
2,Difficult to seal,"I've followed the instructions to a letter and these containers are very dicey to seal. Sometimes it works, sometimes I have to try multiple times to get it to seal, sometimes I just give up. It also seems to take an extraordinarily long time to seal the container even when it does work. In addition, one of my container lids broke, a part of the plastic ridge inside the lid broke off so that one doesn't work at all, and this is after literally less than 10 (probably far fewer) uses. I would get the canisters any day over these, I just wish they had more small sized options."
4,"These are good, new user","I use these for storing the rest of a can of frejoles and for storing shredded cheese. As with all products of this nature they require a bit of downward pressure on the lid when you seal them. The seal remains, the cheese stays just as I made it and the beans are like new, they don't collect moisture. I recommend this product. They may seem small but so are the amounts of food I am storing. I can get three uses out of one can of beans. I don't put the lids in the dishwasher, that would be dumb. But the bottoms are like new every time. The packaging says leave a half inch below the top of the container, don't pay attention to that. This will store a whole leftover serving of pasta, sans red sauce of course. More like pesto. Hello!"
1,Wallet Kickin popcorn,Warning - this is $7.99 for 1 bag of microwave popcorn and it is not a 3.2 pound bag like the shipping weight indicates. I love the product but I returned and will get elsewhere. For cheaper popcorn go to the movie theater.
3,Good Information but No Lists of Hits,"I found this reference to be useful, but I was looking for lists of hits by the artists, and there was only a brief timeline of some hits. That timeline was good to have, however."
5,Spot-on survey of Swing Era,"Unlike a previous reviewer, I find Schuller's ""biases"" quite refreshing. He is unafraid to distinguish the outstanding from the merely imitative or blantantly commercial, whether in comparing bands or musicians or in pointing out the strong points and weak points of individual artists.While not providing individual biographies, he does manage to put the music into a social/economic context and does better than any other writer in speaking frankly about the interplay between black and white artists during this era without prejudice on either side."
3,Central Chef,This item would be nice if it wasn't received damaged and Central Chef has a working email address that didn't bounce back so one could get a RMA to return the product.
1,Do not buy,"When i first bought these it oke them outta the package and noticed they were very unimpressive quality, i figured it would be worth it for the comfort and noise cancellin quality. the buds fit secure but i had a problem the first time i went to use them one bud had split in half just sitting in my car not been touched, i reattached and it just fell of again. Also u have to spin the input jack around for it to connect and if you bumb it it will fuss out and only work in one ear. overall this is the worst purchase i have made in my life."
1,Broken in one week,"First the sound quality was definitly lacking. No base at all. Then the earphones had trouble getting sound in both ears without constantly resetting the plug into the phone. Then within a week, one of the earpieces broke off. I would not recommend them at all."
1,Dont' buy it!!!,Too flimsy and sound when listening to music from phone is horrible. Also ear pieces don't stay in very well. Waste of money.
1,The headphone sucks,The head phone sucks. It's not loud enough and it distorts everything that comes out. If you turn the volume up the only thing that amplifies is the static. Not worth the $5. It is basically going to the trash bin.
2,Poor quality product,"Shipping was quick, and product arrived in new condition; however the sound quality was tinny (no bass). One of the ear buds fell apart each time I took it out of my ear. I used superglue to re-attach the plastic pieces and now that side doesn't work at all. Oh well, the price was right and the shipping was quick."
3,Not Compatible with the Vaio FS980,"Although this is supposed to be a Port Replicator for the FS Series it is not compatiable with the FS980.The replicator has prongs that plug into the bottom of the laptop and there is nothing to plug into in the FS980. Luckily, Amazon accepts returns, but I'm out $10 for shipping it back.I called Sony and was told they do not make a port replicator for this particular notebook and was told since they haven't by now, they more than likely will never.Best Buys even has this port replicator listed on their site as one of the accessories available for the Vaio FS980."
3,Sony VAIO Port Replicator,"It does what it is supposed to do. Keep your keyboard, mouse, and monitor already plugged in so you don't have to connect and disconnect them from your laptop every time. Other than that, I guess I am spoiled by the Dell replicators we use at work. They lock into place. On this unit the plug part is so small I wasn't even sure it was connected. And there is nothing that secured the laptop to the replicator. So if I lift the laptop it disconnects from the replicator. Ok if you are on the go but sometimes I just want to move the laptop without discconnecting.So like I said, good for its intended purposes but does not secure the laptop in place."
5,A Book That Will Make You Better,This is a book that will challenge you. He covers quite a bit of ground and will almost certain jack you up in one way or another. It's a good book if your not afraid to get challenged.
5,STUNNING,"I was able to watch this through my cable provider ...and I cannot believe how amazing this film is. I await the precious day when it's out on DVD...I will buy it and tell everybody I know to buy/watch it. This is the most haunting, chilling, and incredible beautiful film..I highly highly recommend this!!!!!! Norwegian cinema is a hidden gemstone...and this film is STUNNING. The acting, the true history behind the film, the cinematography, the mood, all of it."
5,Foolish was one of Master P's only good movies,"I am not really feeling Master P as a rap artist but when it came to the movie ""Foolish"" he did a good job. It must of been the atmosphere of having Eddie Griffin in the movie and not all of the NoLimit family. This movie was funny from beginning to the end. Eddie really helped Master P out with the movie business. Now all Master P needs is help with his rapping style and he might be tight after all. The movie was not just for the blacks to see it was also a good movie for anyone else of any culture or color. You need to go and check this movie out. NOW!!!!!!"
4,An enthusiastic guide for your first trip,"This book is for everyone who wants to be like Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttleworth but doesn't have the millions to spend yet. Because this book tells what it must have felt like for them to be genuine space tourists, and at the same time gives all potential space tourists good hopes for regular affordable trips to space in the near future. It is enthusiastically written, with lots of details about what each space tourist should know and be prepared for, with the occassional twink of the eye, or a critical look where that is needed."
3,"From 2005 (Or, ""Forget it, Yuri. It's Chinatown."")","This is a cool book, but it mentions SpaceShip One as an upcoming event. A lot has changed and clarified since then. Good basic information about any theoretical processing of space tourists up to launch, which will likely remain unchanged for the time being--and therefore recommended with one caveat: There is no discussion of the moral values (or possible lack thereof) implicit in a space vacation. (The reason I mention this is that the moment the first space tourist does take off, someone, somewhere, is going to point to a heroic teacher being paid minimum wage, and also to a starving child, and also to a homeless campground within sight of the launch contrail, etc. And rightly so.)OTOH, why should a book like this bother with issues like that? Hell, it's all going to happen here in Florida anyway."
5,"Nice tone, needs a lot of lung","I had the standard recorder training in elementary school music classes, and decades later I thought maybe I could use this low F whistle in a song I was recording in my home studio. There are only 6 holes in tin whistles, but the bigger, deeper ones like this F whistle take a lot of wind, and they demand a great deal of breath control to sound right. (It's easy to underblow and go flat on the lower notes.) The finger holes are spaced far apart, but fortunately I have very long fingers. So, it took a lot more practice than I expected, but this instrument recorded beautifully. The intonation is right on, and the tone is soft & breathy.Bottom line: This ain't no school recorder! This instrument sounds great, but like all new musical instruments, I had to practice quite a bit before I could get it to sound as good as it should. The instrument's quality was there, just waiting for my skill level (& breath) to catch up."
1,"some real gems, but some paste","This album was released back in 1988, by which time Aerosmith were signed to Geffen, and their former label Columbia were understandably keen to capitalise on the band's resurgence. They'd already put out a pair of ""Classics Live"" albums, which were good enough, but this collection is nothing short of a cynical cash-in.With such a wealth of material at hand, the previous ""Greatest Hits"" compilation was bound to overlook a number of classics, but there's no excuse for this second anthology to do just the same. Sure, there are some good songs on here, but there are plenty of better ones that aren't: what about S.O.S (Too Bad), Lightning Strikes, Seasons of Wither, Sight for Sore Eyes?What you actually get is a seemingly random selection of album tracks with a few genuine ""gems"" scattered throughout. If you already have the ""Greatest Hits"" and want to investigate more of the early material you should just buy ""Toys in the Attic"" and ""Rocks""."
1,Not What I Expected,"I have listened to the 3 cd box set that has self titled aerosmith, get your wings, and toys in the attic. This album didn't compare to those and was totally disappointed. Get those three and their current albums, this album belongs in the waste of money bin."
4,Not a bad place to start...,"When paired with the better-known ""Greatest Hits"", ""Gems"" is the second half on an excellent primer to pre-comeback Aerosmith. However, much like any compilation package, this is only supposed to begin the journey. The ideal end result for the label is that you purchase more old Aerosmith albums. And, honestly, that's what you should do. In the interests of space (the album only clocks in at 53 minutes, average length by 1988 standards), a number of classic Aerosmith songs have been left off - there is no ""Big Ten-Inch Record"", ""Seasons Of Wither"", or ""No More, No More"" on here. But ""Gems"" is what it is - a jumping-off point for the Aerosmith novice, and a boarding pass for an amazing journey. Buy this."
4,Kicking Out The Classic Gems Of Aerosmith,"A Great complaiton of Aerosmith`s lesser known songs. Perfect for crusin in my car. Especally with songs like chip away the stone, and nobody`s fault. This is a must for any Aerosmth fan All these classic gems are the prime cuts of Aerosmith`s carrer."
1,Where's the beef?,"Anderson and Beason try unsuccessfully to combine the particle physics subject matter of hard sci-fi author Gregory Benford with the ""I'm just a good-old FBI agent"" narrative approach of Tom Clancy.While the story successfully presents a mystery involving high-energy particle physicists, there is very little technical content to go along with it. Besides having predictable 1-dimensional characters (just like Clancy) the book has its share of other aggravations. For starters, it contains a critical overuse of the unheard of term, ""towelhead"", describing East Indians that wear turbans. And let's not forget the ""sepia-eyed"" nurse whose too often quoted expression is that she ""never felt this helpless since Chernobyl"" and did we mention that she was ""sepia-eyed""? Oh yes and just in case you didn't get it before, her eyes are the color of, what's that, oh yes ""sepia"". ARRGGG!! And what in the world is so special about a checkered tablecloth turned 90 degrees?Terribly unsatisfying read."
4,"good,but not great","read the title.1 train kept a rollin=woo!!!great!!!2 kings and qweens=pretty kool3 sweet emotion=one of the best aerosmith songs ever4 dream on=best flippin song ever written!!!!!!!5 mama kin=great!6 3mile/reefer head=sweeeet....7 lord thighs=ok,not great8 major barbra=sucks.no good.pooy."
2,Maybe not completely worthless... (2 STARS),"Yes this album does only have 8 tracks (7 of them live), the quality of the performance and the production is pretty poor, but it does include some interesting tunes, namely ""Three Mile Smile"" and ""Train Kept a Rollin'"" that fans wouldn't expect them to put on the record. That still isn't enough to make a potential listener want to buy, much less create a new Aerosmith fan. In essence, your money is much better spent on ""Bootleg"" which is a more complete performance and collection of songs (but still only rates 5 out of 10). They need to go through old master tapes of performances and make a killer two disc live set from the 70's a la Zeppelin's ""How the West Was Won.""The real attraction is the definitive recording of ""Major Barbara."" It's better than the recording used on the ""Pandora Box Set."" That still doesn't make it worth your 10 dollars. ""Classics Live 2"" is better, but not by much.Overall: 4 out of 10."
3,Pick Your Guitarists - the Fire Still Roars,"The fact is, if Wikipedia didn't tell us which guitarists played on which tracks, we wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The performances from ""Classics Live,"" whether they were driven by the guitars of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford or their brief replacements Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay, are fiery and raw, though most times a bit muddy. Taken into account these recordings come from a band in tense splinters, the first volume of ""Classics Live"" is quite a solid disc of proof that Aerosmith were consummate showmen. 'Sweet Emotion,' 'Train Kept a-Rollin' and 'Dream On' are highlights, though the studio outtake 'Major Barbra' is a bore. 'Kings and Queens' is the biggest surprise, departing from the studio wizardry of its original and turned into a blistering rendition."
5,"Calmness, Awareness, and Love - right here!","This is a truly great cd. I am new to meditation, but Bodhipaksa makes it simple and accessible. There is no background music (which is really a good thing), and his voice is very soothing and pleasant. He also allows you to count your breaths at your own pace, instead of counting out loud the entire time, which can make you feel rushed or distracted. The Metta Bhavana is my favorite. It helps you cultivate ""lovingkindness"" towards yourself and others, and it is very effective.The title says it all: ""For calmness, awareness, and love.""Bodhipaksa also has a really great website listed on the cd cover. I found very helpful information on meditation posture and other things.I would recommend this to anyone interested in meditation. I can't say enough about it."
3,Guided Meditations,this CD does have a calming effect. the mans voice has a slight accent in it. i don't like how there is no music in it. it is quite short so if you don't have alot of time you can get through it quickly. all in all its not bad. I wouldnt reccomend it though because of the absence of music.
2,Anything but relaxing,"This seemed to be very highly rated and my own doctor recommended it but I could NOT get into this CD at all. There is no music, which for some may be great, but for others like me is just distracting. Listen to the clip first carefully before you consider buying; if the gentleman's voice seems to go in one ear and out the other, then beware. I could not concentrate on his voice in the least. I've listened to many guided meditations before and never had that problem. I really enjoy guided meditation but this CD did nothing but raise my blood pressure. It just did not click with me and I'm still surprised at how many people liked it."
4,Very Good,"Although I haven't listened to the CD in full, I can tell you that this guy is very good, and I will actually listen to this one again, and again....especially since I just quit smoking! Good voice, techniques, very therapeutic."
3,Great for Beginners,"This is a good starting place for someone new to meditation.I thought the price was rather steep just to hear Bodhipaksa talking thru the entire CD, but again, a good no nonsense approach to the basics of meditation."
4,Not just for beginners,"I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this CD, but, after listening to it a few times, I'm happy I gave it a chance. I have been meditating for years (Vipassana, mantra meditations, etc.). This CD slows down my thoughts, and clears my head very quickly.As they say in Yoga: keep that beginner's mind. This CD is great for beginners but I also find it useful for those times when I want something external to help me focus.Perhaps, in years to come, I will be so adept in my meditation practice that this will be completely superfluous. For now, it's a little luxury, a healing voice to ease me into my my own peace."
5,Just as I was hoping,The guided meditations true to their descriptions. Very pleased - a bonus is that the speaker's voice is soothing and kind.
1,Not what I expected,"I've used guided meditations in the past. This is not a meditation guide, it's a breathing guide. His voice is monotone and puts me to sleep."
2,Eh.,"I actually haven't listened to the whole thing, I just wasn't engaged. Plus, there's no music! The guy's voice is pleasing to listen to, but I just couldn't get into it. I have found many other guided meditations that are far more effective for me."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this tape to relax me and help me go to sleep, but I got so irritated with content that instead of relaxing, I fretted about spending all that money for something I will never use and can't return. I bought this tape because of the good reviews, but I'll quit paying attention to reviews from now on."
2,"OK, but only fair for the Bodhipaksa",The only reason I listened to this CD for a second time was to make sure that I gave it a fair chance BEFORE never playing it again.
3,It works,"I liked it, it is helpful for a beginner or a person who has not yet mastered the art of mediation. Relaxing, it helps a new mediator develope an appreciate for what is to come with practise."
1,A Waste of Money,"I didn't like ""Guided Meditations: For Calmness, Awareness, and Love."" I guess it was a little too Buddhist for me. In particular, I didn't like the ""loving kindness"" and the ""walking meditation"" doesn't do a whole lot of good when listening at home.I tried using this CD 4 times before I donated it to the Goodwill. You are better off buying something else."
1,Disappointed and misguided,"I bought this CD based on the below review,what a mistake. This CD is worse than a meditation 101 class. Very elementary approach, repetitive, and boring. Highly recommend taking a pass on this one."
5,Calming the Spirit,"This CD really works to calm the spirit. I listen at night and when walking. The words are inspirational and soothing. Do not listen to this CD when driving. Great for anxious people, the authors words and are uplifting while at the same time so soothing that it lulls you into deep calmness."
4,Very effective meditation CD,"this is the best one I've found to far in terms of getting peaceful and centered. I didn't think I'd like it when it started, but I relaxed and went with and ended up loving it. I wish you could forward through the tracks easier as when you do it a lot, it gets repetitive and if you want to get to the walking meditation it takes forever. I also change the chant from ""may I"" to ""I am,"" as I believe in positive affirmation rather than wishing for something. Very peaceful CD."
2,Average,"I was a bit disappointed when I received this CD. With all the rave reviews I thought it would be wonderful, but I found it only average. I was dissapointed that there wasn't any music, no sound in the silence (I can do that without the CD). Also, I had a bit of trouble understanding him. I don't know if it's the quality of the recording or his accent, but I felt like I had to work really hard to figure out what he was saying. I purchased Experience Yoga Nidra: Guided deep relaxation by Swami Janakananda Saraswati and I would recommend his CD instead.Please read my other reviews on Amazon if you have time. Thank You."
4,Original publication of Clive Barker's Hellraiser,"This anthology was the first publication of CLive Barker's novella, ""The Hellbound Heart,"" which was the basis for his film adaptation HELLRAISER. ;)"
4,Made me take a trip.,"This book is great. A lot goes on. Typewriter repairs, organs, volcanos, the whole works. It made me want to go to Iceland. And then I went and it was awesome.Iceland the country 5 stars.Iceland the book 4 stars.Sorry Iceland (the book) Iceland the country just eggs it."
5,two sides of the reading coin,"After reading the 'real' reviews, I am reminded that the reader is always in danger of seeking far too much from symbolism than the author may have meant in the first place. But after re-reading Iceland, I think the professional reviewers phoned it in and passed over the fact that nearly every paragraph, definetly every page has some nugget - that describes the human condition, meditations on the worth of human life, the validity (or lack) of it over anything else, and how quickly our own memories will be forgotten when we are gone. Definetly read it a second time - it is like a crossword puzzle trying to figure out what each character means both literally and symbolically. Writers like Jim Krusoe have their craft honed to a fine point and they'll cut you with it as many times as they see fit."
1,Ambiguous - and not in a good way.,I found this book to be extremely pretentious and uninspiring. I had hoped that the ending might redeem the novel somewhat. It didn't. I would not recommend this book.
4,More beautiful in person,I love this watch. The picture doesn't do it justice. It looks even more beautiful up close.
4,Beautiful watch,"Bought this watch along with the Bulova 96T63 for my gf birthday since I was not sure which one she would prefer. Turns out she chose this one, and it's easy to see why one you see the item up close. The other watch is nice in it's own right, but this one has it beat in terms of eye catching sparkle and versatility. She is a petite girl about 5'5"" and athletic with slender wrists so this watch is perfect in size for her. I gave it to her at her birthday dinner and everyone there remarked about how good it looks. She still raves about it even days later! The only reason I took a star off was because there are no real diamonds and the watch is pretty light, but hey for around $130 the value of this watch can't be beat."
5,ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!,THE IS THE MOST GORGEOUS WATCH I HAVE EVER SEEN!! THE PICTURE DEFINITELY DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE. I WISH THERE WAS ONE MORE LINK IN THIS WATCH BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE SNUG AND MY WRIST IS AVERAGE SIZE.
5,Beautiful!!!,"This watch is so beautiful and unique! I had to take it to a watch repair shop to have the band sized, but other than that I've been very, very satisfied!!!"
1,"YUCK, LOUSEY, DON'T BUY","the most poorly lighted, scripted, acted,produced, and degfinitely most directed movie ever. don't even waste the time to read this, just look at the single star for ""lousey-hated it-wish i could get my money back - movie QQ"
4,A good reference guide for CR 8.5 & 9 users,"Crystal Reports 8.5 User's Guide is a concise reference for Crystal Reports 8.5 and 9.0 users. Many of the examples are the same that you find in the Crystal Reports help menus. Having a desktop copy in hand to learn how to do ""not-your-average"" report writing makes it easier to get the job done. I would recommend this book for occasional reference when switching back and forth between your report and the help menu becomes a nuisance.--Julie Mifsud"
4,Great Product but it forgot to mentioned a required pwr supply,The liftmaster garage door opener receiver is a well designed product and so far a reliable one. HOWEVER there was no mention in the product description that you may need to purchase a powersupply in order for it to work! This added another couple of weeks before the Door Opener was operational. The SELLER/RETAILER needs to add this little tidbit of information to the description of the receiver.
4,"Smarter, faster, easier receiver",After replacing the old Genie opener for my garage I decided to also replace the gate opener receivers so I could use the remotes from the opener and get better security to boot. The install was so easy and the programming of the remotes so easy that it took only minutes for each one. Even teaching my car to communicate with them was much easier as the range had increased considerably so the training was very fast.My order was quickly processed and the delivery actually came a day ahead of the estimate. The price the lowest too somI am very happy with this product and vendor.
1,missing key content from print edition - poor quality,"The Oct 12 Kindle edition shows an actual picture of the print Fortune cover, which shows a feature article about Charlie Rose. Yet this article is nowhere in the Kindle edition. I read it in the print edition and it was excellent. I contacted Amazon and received a lame answer that its controlled by the publisher. So beware that any Kindle magazine can be missing key content of the print edition totally at the publisher's discretion. All Kindle magazines are suspect as being inferior and you cannot assume you're getting the same content as the print edition."
2,Back-Issues on Kindle,"As a kindle owner, I was disappointed to learn you cannot purchase back-issues of Fortune magazine (or other magazines). Even as I write this review, it is frustrating that the one issue I want ""100 Best Companies to Work For"" is still visually advertised on Amazon / Kindle website, but not available for downloading on Kindle."
3,Why so much for so little?,"Why is the Kindle version $30 a year? It costs more to get the stripped down Kindle version of the magazine than for a 1 year subscription ($19.99 for the year)for the full printed version. I don't get it, put ads in the Kindle version I don't care. But it shouldn't cost more to get an email than it does to print and distribute a magazine."
4,tsdtrader,"In response to Kindle Geek there is a way to get back issues. Go on to the Amazon acount that your Kindle is registered on and go under whatever periodical you wish to get a back issue of and then siply select: send wirelessly to your kindle, then select whitch back issue you want sent to your kindle and amazon will send it, free of charge."
1,Kindle only!?,WHAT!? Kindle only? That stinks. Judging from the other reviews its also missing content from the printed version. Come on Fortune! Give us a printed version we can read on any device.
3,efficient but not quite as rewarding,"There is a huge difference in price between the printed (at least for Canada) and Kindle versions, and I can see why. The lack of visuals in the Kindle version makes a huge difference in my enjoyment of the issue The simple absence of a cover with the Kindle version, is something I miss greatly - in my mind, this is a distinguishing feature between a newspaper and magazine. At the same time, with the Kindle version I love how efficiently I can go through all the articles. Once I figured out the navigation, I love the ability to see a summary of the content and pick out what to read immediately and what to save for later. I also love being on vacation and having my Fortune delivered to my lap! So while I would say the print version kicks butt over the Kindle version, I am going to give the Kindle version a try. It's different but does have it's advantages. It will not be for everybody. However could you please give us a cover?!"
1,Inability to order previous issues of Fortune Magazine,I agree that it is a shame that you cannot order previous issues from the kindle store. I would think this somethimg that most readers want a loss of revenue for amazon.
3,No Captions! What a shame!,"What's going on with HBO? How they can put out a worse product, not keeping the standards they already have? The first two seasons had english subtitles but the third doesn't have any! It was a very bad surprise, since I noticed that only when I started to watch the DVDs. This is very disrespectful with the hearing impaired and foreigner fans of Sex and The City.Beside this faux pas, the series is brilliant and funny as ever. Hope they get the subtitles back in the next season."
5,can't wait,"I got the 1st and 2nd Season Of ""Sex In the City"" for Xmas. So when I knew the 3rd Season would be available in May, I preordered it; so that I could get it ASAP. As soon as I recieved it I started watching and couldn't stop watching until I was done with all 3 DVDs. I loved it as much as the other 2 Seasons, I can't wait for the fourth season. If you are a fan of this TV show or know someone who is, the third season is a must have. Well worth its price."
4,So Funny!!!,This is the best season by far! No need to have seen the first two seasons to appreciate this off the wall series! Highly recommended for 17+
4,What is she wearing????,The 3rd season is not as funny as the other ones.But Carry's outfits are worth watching....and I thought it couldn't get any worth...but it does! :)
1,Take note BEFORE you buy,"HBO Video is releasing Sex and the City: The Complete Series on November 1st. The mammoth twenty-disc box set will include all ninety-four episodes from the six seasons that the show aired. As for bonus materials, all the extras from the previous season sets will be included. An additional disc of new bonus features has been created for this release and will contain a trivia game, guest appearance highlights, as well as various guides to fashion, restaurants and dating advice. The ""super-premium"" set will be packaged as a decorative velvety photo album coffee table book. Retail will be hernia-inducing $299.95"
3,Great series - bad packaging!,"The case was broken when we received it! I was replacing a lost disk from my full series set, so it wasn't a huge deal, but it was disappointing nonetheless."
5,EXCLLENT ENTERTAINMENT!,"Get this set and all the other seasons, especially the first 3. They are wonderful!! They deal with real issues in very clever, comical ways. Trust me, you'll like it- unless you are a prude."
5,sensation and the city,"this is going to be the dvd of the year.the sexual goings on of these four manhatten lovlies is compulsive viewing. never have i been captivated by a show that is so up front and so accurate at analysing relationships, sex and love. its like having 4 of your best friends giving you therapy.if you missed the first two seasons, then buy them and catch up -if you saw it, then you are probably as hungry for this dvd to his the store as i am!new york is the idea place to set this show as it can be one of the coldest, cruelest city's but also one of the most fun and friendly... pure genius."
5,Sex and the City Season 3,"Great. I love this show. Season 3 is my favorite. Well, and 2. And One. Love this show."
5,one of the best seasons,does anyone know if the music at the beginning of the DVDs on the main title page is an actual complete song? if so could you tell me who it is and what the song it called? thanks
2,no SUBTITLES in this season,"i bought the whole series and its great ,the show is great and everything but in this season which is THE BEST SEASON in the show i think-from some reason they didnt put NO SUBTITLES-and im from israel and dont control english so well (its my second language) so i only understand 60% of what they say-this is really sucks especially in this season which is the best in the show. so i rate it as 2 stars although this is a great season but without SUBTITLES - watching it is a real HEADACHE-to transelate it without knowing how the words they speak are written."
3,No subtitles!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just bought Season 3, and found out that the subtitle function is not available for this DVD! I can't beleive this since both Season 1 and Season 2 have subtitles available! I am so disappointed about this, since I'm not a native English Speaker, subtitle is very important for me!!! I can't beleive they issue a DVD with no subtitles, why are they taking this feature away when it was available in the previous DVD (Seaons 1 and 2). This is not going to be as fun as I watch Season 1 and 2 without the subtitles. They have 2 other different languages to choose from (Spanish and French) but NO SUBTITLE?I'm not alone about this no subtitle issue, as I can read that there is another customer who complained about this as well."
1,A Truly unfunny sitcom,This show is on TBS and I finally had the chance to see it. I didn't like it. This show is all about women over 30 having sex and laughing about it. It's a pointless show. If you want funny. Buy Family Guy or Friends or the simpsons. But not this show
5,"Excellent Season, Excellent Gift","I believe this season was one of the best, the characters are fully developed into their own and we know them, yet they still manage to surprise us. Many people might have been disappointed with Carrie affair with Big, but that is life and these things happen in reality. So I looked at it in that way rather that Carrie being totally silly for cheating on such a great boyfriend (Adian).I believe this Set is freaking fabulous!!!"
4,Fun in NYC,"I have to admit that my wife likes this much more than I do. For her, it's an ongoing reminder of New York City life that we both love. We live in Munich, Germany, so we are seeing these episodes for the first time. This continuation series seems to be sillier than the 1st two seasons, and the sexual graphics are far more in-your-face than in the previous two versions. Probably not something for your 12-year old babysitter to be watching just yet. However, we find the discussions, humor and themes to be excellent adult entertainment with a unapologetic no-holds-barred attitude, which we find far more refreshing than general American TV fare. The shots of NYC buildings, parks and streets really add to the stories, and the quality of the DVD (both sound and picture) is excellent.But for the life of me, I just can't understand at all what Big sees in Carrie. But then again, Big is no great catch either, I suppose. Ah, well."
5,"Sex,cosmopotitans,shoes,NY,Chris Noth...what more do u want?","This season is THE season to see! The characters are more defined.....making them more ""real"" feeling this season and the writing is simply hilarious. My favorite character is Big a classic Hollywood looking wealthy man that just is too smooth for his own good. The chemistry between Big (Chris Noth) and Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is at times very romantic and at times very frustrating. Spend a little money on this dvd......you won't regret it."
5,I love Sex and the CIty,If you have never seen Sex and the City you better act now. This is the best Woman show I have ever watched. This is really about how Women are and what we are thinking about. This DVD should be great. I have season 1 and 2 and can't wait to add season 3 to my collection.
3,Great Show but NO SUTITLES,"The show itself worths 5 stars and i took two off due to the lack of subtiles. I have just stared watching a few episodes of the 3rd seasons, and I was surprised to see that the subtitles were not included. It's not mentioned in the description of the DVD by amazon either- in fact, Amazon has mistakenly labeled this set as Closed-caption. The first 2 seasons have got this function!!! While it's less distracting to watch with the subtitles on, it's annoying when you can't make out what the characters are saying. I don't know how HBO could have overlooked this. OR could it be that it's about the region-coded issue?- customers should be buying from their home countries??? This show would be so much more enjoyable by all viewers from all countries if this function were included."
5,GREAT PRODUCT. WHY DO i HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORDS. WHY CAN'T I JUST RATE WITH THE STARS?,...GREAT PRODUCT. WHY DO i HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORDS. WHY CAN'T I JUST RATE WITH THE STARS?
2,The season when it all starts to go downhill,"I was so excited when I found out that HBO put the 3rd season of SITC on DVD since I don't have HBO. However, the more I watched the more i found myself disgusted by the show. It has zero substance.Every episode is the same thing, Carrie attracted to a non-attractive man and stressed over overpriced clothes and shoes while trying to write some sex column.The other characters on the show importance seems to be diminished by the minute.By the end, my freind had to convince me to continue watching.If you are a die-hard fan, go ahead and watch, if not, go floss your teeth, it will be more entertaining."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this item because it marked as ""like new"" in condition and was very disappointed to find that when it arrived the case was broken and more than one of the DVD's did not work I ended up replacing it."
4,The unsung hero-Grumman's TBF/TBM Avenger,"Let's hope that the second edition of this book -I own the first- has the nice supplement (0816805822) included, otherwise I can recommend you to look for the Squadron/Signal in Action of this plane. Together with ist supplement this 1970 book has something to offer, it becomes 90 pages of information together with good photographs and a good text. Without the supplement it loses much informational value about the units who flew this plane, where and when, something the Squadron/Signal book can't offer in its 49 densely photo-packed pages. Compared to earlier books in the Aero series this one stands out by having far more and better textual information by the writing duo B.R.Jackson and T.E.Doll, who also wrote the book about the Devastator in this series."
3,Good for first timers,"This book provided help to many of my friends and family who are new to computers, especially Outlook. However, this particular Quick Course book was limited to the most basic and some intermediate levels of Outlook."
5,First book I have finished for Outlook 2000,"Easy to read, great examples, and covers alot of detail in a relatively short period of time. Highly recommended! First Outlook 2000 book that I finished reading. Most others are tailored for people using Exchange. This one tells you to skip the following if you don't have Exchange."
5,PROOF OF MIRACLES,"I've personally known Pastor Paul and Alice Prather for lots of years. Several years before I met them, Paul suddenly needed a miracle. His Christian faith did not, at that time, include the working of miracles. He was given a few days to live by the medical profession, but God proved that He is in charge and granted him a miracle, the instant removal of a cancerous tumor from his brain without assistance from the medical profession. Remember the wonderful hymn of praise: He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today. So does Paul.The book is full of a lifetime of testimonies from Paul and Alice about the love and power of our God through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Your faith will grow with each chapter."
4,Buone sonorità,"Buone ed alternative sonorità dall'oriente. Musica vivace e caratterizzata positivamente dallo strumento a corde giapponese (tipo arpa).Soddisfatto dell'acquisto, consiglio a tutti quelli che vogliono spaziare un pò nello smooth jazz."
4,Great for any music lover,"Great for any music lover. It's an upbeat, smooth jazz, make you happy cd."
4,Best of Hiroshima,"fine musicianship on this DVD but I miss more authentically Japanese content, this is too pop mainstream for my taste"
5,"A great ""Best Of"" compilation","This is the best of the quazi-cultural group, Hiroshima. A good cross between Japanese and American influences. Sort of a healthy synergy of East and West which creates a style that is a pleasure to listen to. The songs that really stand out are ""Another Place"", ""One Wish"" and ""Hawaiian Electric"". It's probably worth buying the CD just for those 3 songs!If you are a music purist, you might not like this concept. Purist or not, you'll have to admit that this one works."
3,This Is A Good Starting Place!!!,"I always recommend greatest hits or compilation CD's when listeners are unfamiliar with an artist. Such would be the case with Hiroshima (the L.A. based band). This is a good starting place for those wanting to get a taste of their world/pop/jazz sound. They have their own unique style. The top cuts on this one are San Say, One Wish, and Go."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I wholeheartedly agree with the 5-star reviews of the music and performances on the two LPs included on this CCM remastered CD. However, I rate this particular CD 2 stars (or even 1 star) due to the weak, shoddy remastering. If you want this music to sound as marvelous as it sounded on pristine copies of the original vinyl LPs in the late 1960s, get the two Buddha Records CD reissues from year 2000 (or: a good turntable + eBay + mint copies of LPs that originally sold in the millions = pure joy). The Buddha reissues include all the bonus tracks that appear on the CCM reissue. You have to ask yourself, how can CCM reissue music in 2007 that sounds significantly worse than when it was reissued by the original label in 2000? The artists originally involved in the production and performance of this music must be disgusted."
2,I'm Prejudiced...,"I actually read this book before it was submitted [having 'Mike' live with me helped], and was disappointed that he was asked to take a great deal of the meat out of the story. As someone who knew the model for Sharon Rose, i wasn't thrilled to see her killed off, either [he didn't warn her, either, & kept insisting in act that he'd 'save Sharon' in the final cut].It's the earliest cyberpunk story - written *before* there was such a term - but if he had the power, i'd suggest he re-releade it *with* the 'good stuff' added back in. I wouldn't insist that he save Sharon, but his dishonesty to all of his pre-readers flaws what could've been a better book. Maybe even he realized it, because this book doesnt sing the way the unpublished MS did..."

2,Who want to clean a seat every time?,"Agree with many other poor reviews. Because it's in two pieces, urine is collected in between so for boys it is a problem. Apparently the instructions indicate the need to take apart and clean. But I don't have to take apart my toilet after I go... why should I have to take apart a seat for my son? Cheap and not very sanitary."
1,Not good for a boy,"I bought this seat for my 2 1/2 year old son because he didn't like sitting on the ""little potty"". I thought it would be good because it has that built-in pee catcher in the front. The problem is that the seat is way too small. My son is average size and every time I try to put him on the seat, it takes several times to get him in the right position. It is very hard to get him on there so his penis is anyhwere close to peeing into the toilet. He always seems to be hanging over the edge so the pee will go on the floor. I hate this seat and I will have to buy a different brand."
2,Not good for oblong toilet seat.,The first time I sat it on the toilet for my daughter to use it she sat down and it fell through the toilet seat under her!!! Not recommened for oblong toilets.
1,Not worth even 1 cent,As if potty training weren't already frustrating enough this product now makes it possible to have to clean up a mess even if your child makes it all in the toilet. Urine gets stuck between the two pieces and spills out if you try to move it. It never really feels clean ans just makes an already messy process worse.
2,Annoying to clean,"The two separate pieces of this potty seat make it a pain to clean. When my son pees on it, his pee usually hits right in the seam and the pee goes between the two pieces, collecting there, then spilling when I take it off the potty and making it necessary for me to clean it frequently. It's a pain and I'm searching Amazon right now to find another potty seat to buy. It's a shame, because other than that one thing, I really like it. Maybe it works better for girls."
1,Yuck,"I really, really can't stand this toilet seat. All it does is collect urine in between the 2 parts. And then when you take it off the toilet, more urine drips onto my floor. No thanks."
1,"Would not fit, dangerous, and small hole!","This seat would not fit our toilet seat. It is very unstable when my toddler tries to sit on it, it slides back or left/right. That means he can't even try to go on himself without sitting on it wrong or possibly falling in. Also the boy pee blocker in front scrapes his penis. :P Also was afraid the hole looks so small!We decided to buy the munchkin potty seat instead which fit perfectly.Munchkin Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary"
2,Not the potty seat for a boy.,"If you are training a boy, don't bother getting this seat. The urine guard is a joke. It might be fine for bowel movements, but not peeing. I think we'll keep it around for our daughter, but for right now I'm going to have to figure something else out for our son.There was a reviewer whose son was horribly injured by this seat because it was too sharp. I will say that ours is very smooth, so I hope this means that they have at least fixed that problem."
1,What a Mess!,"i wish i had seen the reviews on this before we bought it. i came on here to also chime in on what a terrible design it is for boys!! it is designed to come apart and that means when the boys sit and pee, it just collects urine between the white and blue pieces. they snap together, so to clean the seat, you have to struggle to get it unsnapped. meanwhile, the urine just pours out of where it has collected. the hole is too small as well, guaranteeing a mess to have to clean up if he has to do #2. if you have extra time on your hands and enjoy added stress during potty training, this is your seat! otherwise, keep looking!"
1,Not a good fit,"This potty seat slides all over our current toilet seat, giving my son a wild ride. The hole also isn't big enough to get all of the important parts over the toilet at once. It may work for you, but it doesn't work for us."
2,Not sure yet,"We have not really gotten into training our 14 month old grandson, but his mom and I thought this seat would be good in both homes and I do like the looks of it and how easy it fits onto the toilet"
4,Light enough for a toddler to handle,"My two yo wasn't interested in her small potty, but she loves this seat. It's light enough, and the handles are well-placed so that she can place it on the toilet herself. She is tremendously proud of herself to be using the toilet, and likes being able to remove the seat and put it away between uses. We have oblong low-flow toilets and haven't had any trouble with this compact, padded seat. It snaps together easily, too."
1,fits over child's head,"Up until now this has been a great potty seat for us: comfortable, fairly stable, and light enough for my daughters to use. This morning my daughter (20 months) managed to get it over her head and we had to cut it off. While she was not in any immediate danger, it was pretty scary for her."
1,I hate this trainer seat,"I am so displeased with this item- I'm on a search to contact the company now to complain about it. I thought it was fine for the first few weeks, then I noticed a horrible odor in my bathroom- it always smelled like urine and I could not figure out why. The one day, my daughter was putting her potty seat on our toilet. She tipped it up and all of this urine poured out onto her pants and socks. Unknown to me, urine had been collecting between the white soft seat and the blue base of this product- the source of the horrible odor. I've made it part of my cleaning rituals to take the seat apart and clean it every week- yet the smell still lingers. Every time I use my bathroom, I can smell that awful smell- I hate it. No matter what I do, I can't get rid of it. I'm on a mission to purchase a better trainer seat."
4,"Ya, Quick Dose of Pulp","For those addicted to Pulp, this anthology rocks. Great Detective fiction mysteries and action. Loaded with Pulp. Gives you your quick fix. Good Read"
2,ugh!,"Dead in the middle of a decent collection of stories is an excessively long, vulgar,racist....even if protagonist is a black and by today's PC ""standards"", blacks cannot be racist/bigoted...violent and misanthropic story. Ruins the rest of the book."
1,"Sade called, she wants her song back","I just heard ""Hana"" on the radio. The strings in ""Hana"" (i.e. the cool part of the song) are taken from Sade's song ""Pearls"" on Love Deluxe. Loop the cool strings, add weird vocals and totally incongruous bongos, and hey, you've created an original song! Just kidding. I'm all for reasonable sampling--this however is a music rip-off (see related: Crazytown, ""Butterfly"")."
4,Helpful book,"This book has some great, up-to-date information in it, but the girly-girl tone gets old. I turn 50 this month and can't imagine caring about some of the stuff the author considers essential. I started laughing when I read ""The Eight Cosmetics Every Woman Over Forty Has To Have: Face Primer, Skin Illuminator, Concealer, Light-diffusing Foundation, Bronzer, Cream or Gel Blush, Anti-feathering Lip Pencil/Lip Gloss, and Lash Extender."" Is she serious?Exercise, a healthy diet, and fresh air will do more for your looks than any cosmetics.I also laughed when I read, ""...if you don't want to change your look in any dramatic fashion (although that is what makes being a girl so much fun!)...""Sometimes I felt like I was reading a fashion magazine instead of a book about menopause. Maybe this book was written for women in New York City or Hollywood?"
4,Worth the Read,Her background gives you a variety of perspectives to try to deal with a difficult time in life. I found several of the websites and products to be helpful. It gives you somethings to try. Every woman is different so not all work but I have found her insight very helpful.
4,informative and entertaining,I find the book both informative and entertaining. It's nice to have all the serious (and useful!) information and still a thing or two to make you laugh
5,Great tool!,"This is a great tool! I had used one previously and wanted one for myself. When I found this one and at a great price also, I decided to buy it."
3,Good start,"This is a good book for beginners and for anyone interested in the art of oil painting since it provides an ""introduction"", or general overview, into oil painting since it covers all the basic techniques, tips, and tricks. It may not be for those who want a more detailed step-by-step type of instruction manual (get a video or take an art class). Yet it is easy to read with short chapters that stand alone as reference. Book has lots of colorful pictures of paintings from famous artists so you can see the types of painting styles it talks about. A decent manual, inspirational and highly recommended reading."
4,Good Pump,"Installation was easy, and the pump works great. A thermo-coupling would have been nice, but an easy fix for later. Yeah, I would recommend this pump."
5,Deeply pleasurable reading.,"""A Case of Nerves"" was very funny, romantic and imaginative. Angie Kay has a very bright future!"
5,swept away with the spirit of scotland; a must read,"Kay transports you to the scottish moors and then back to the 20th century, and it's a ride filled with excitement and lust. Her detailed descriptions of the landscape and structures can only be written through the eyes of a keen, scientific observer. The author clearly understands the trials and tribulations of a modern woman, and i found in kate macGillvray a kindred spirit. Read it as they say, in ""slainte mhath""!"
3,halloween,the costume was a big hit for me....its really adorable on...but there was more complaints that i had about it than it was worth...the inner lining was very itchyand the zipper that is located down the back...bunched and waved making my back look like that of a stegasorous...
4,DanceMania Rocks!!,"Dancemania is the only music series of it's kind that i know of. Dancemania EXTRA is another great CD from these guys. The music is mixed well and flows fluently. Not only is this music great to listen to when you have nothing else to do, it actually relaxes me while i am concentrating on something else, but the beats and rythms have the power to energize also. I would recomend this to not only Dance music lovers, but ALL Music Lovers."
5,Well done and suitable for elementary age children,"This is a very good thematic unit for younger elementary age students. It is reproducible and so suitable for classroom teachers. Students will learn about the basic history, geography, government, and culture of Rome. Fascinating stories from Roman history are retold and children are encouraged to find out more. Story starters are provided to motivate creative thinking. Children are introduced to some simple Latin words so that they can make the connection between the ancient language and modern English. Young people are also introduced to Roman mythology and cultural achievements.There are games, crossword puzzles, project ideas, word searches, research ideas, and maps. Colorful time period stickers are included as well.The material is challenging and interesting, but it is also basic so as not to be overwhelming. All in all, a nice introduction for elementary school students."
3,Not Kotzwinkle's Best,"I was excited about picking up a new book from the author who wrote great books like The Fan Man, The Exile, Dr. Rat, etc. but---This one had promise for a while but then gets muddled in the middle and didn't really keep me interested. Characters like Oldcastle and Lizardo seem to be the heroes, but they take a backseat to others like The Observer, who, I think is the only interesting character in the story. There are others who are introduced, like Man O' War, but their impact on the story is unclear.There's some interesting robotic encounters and other-worldly concepts that keep the reader involved, but, overall, the story is pretty anti-climatic. The theme of humans (or aliens) playing with mortality works well, but the story becomes made-for-tv and fizzles.If you're looking for good Kotzwinkle, I'd recommend the books mentioned above as well as some earlier titles like The Midnight Examiner and The Bear Went Over The Mountain."
3,Disappointed,"I read THE BEAR WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN and it was one of my all time favorites. I was excited to read another by the same author, but this book was hard to follow, and it never really sucked me in. I think he should have spent more time on it, or maybe it's the wrong genre for the writer. I'm still super excited to read his other books and hope more become available on the kindle."
3,Very uneven quality,"This was my first Kotzwinkle book.Despite the three stars I give this book, I give Kotzwinkle's imagination and originality a 5. The strength of his little periphery ideas were intriguing enough to keep me going through the end.The previous posters are correct. The actual ""hero"" of the story, Link, was extremely flat compared to other characters like Oldcastle and Upquark. In addition to this, his personality (what little we can glean from the book) seems to change without explanation as he assumes the role of hero toward the end.The twist in the book was interesting, but it seems to be carried out rather roughly. There is little background or foreshadowing. The storyline just abruptly changes lanes.In addition to this, there seems to be leftover pieces of incomplete or changed subplots.Was it a rushed deadline?The ideas were fantastic, and this could have been a 5-star book with more development."
4,Sony stuff just works.,"Purchased a Sony VGP-UFD1 3.5 USB floppy disk drive...even though it says that it is only to operate with Sony computers, it will work with most any decent unit with the proper setup. No problems yet...yet! Seems that this type of device is hard to screw up but as you know, anything is possible. Not a bad buy for the $."
4,Beautiful work of art,Gorgeous pictorial overview of the Japanese esoteric Buddhist iconography with some description of the meanings behind the symbols. Too bad it's unavailable now...
5,natural causes,"perhaps the best conspiracy film ever made! taught, tightly woven, riveting! even better than the manchurian candidate, and seven days in may! a real sleeper!"
5,child size groovy girl doll,Excellent product received well packed and in perfect condition right on time.
3,"An OK book, but limited","I loved the information shared in this book. Yes, I admit I do look out the window as I'm driving and try to ""figure out what that is."" Such is the excitement of my life. This guidebook addresses a lot of the things I was clueless about and confirmed many of the others that I thought I knew.Too bad that the book isn't more comprehensive. Some of the items discussed seemed to have been picked arbitrarily while some others have been ommitted."
5,Max Richter is GOD!,"I bought The Blue Notebook about a year ago and it has been one of my favorite albums. No stranger am I to modern classical compositions. This Richter album, however, blew the blue notebook away in terms of raw emotional connection, elegance, and shear aural beauty. This album is at the top of a very long list (I own about 2000 albums). If you're a fan of classical compositions, ambient, subtle electronic melodies, or delicate music at all, this album is not to be missed."
3,I like Max Richter.,I am not that familiar with Max Richter's work but I like it and I think the cover art helps in selling it. Although it may seem similiar musically there is some maturity to it.
4,I'm sure I know these people...,"Laisha Rosnau does a wonderful job of evoking real small-town life in this first novel. I grew up in a town much like that where the book is set, and reading this novel was like reliving my adolescence (wait, maybe that's not so good). The story centres on the lives of conflicted small town teenagers, but we also get to know the bizarre but all-too-real adults that influence their lives. A very satifying read that made me laugh, and made me remember why I moved away."
3,Slow Go,"Beautifully written, of course, like all Unsworth's books. But this one unfolds too slowly, with a stuttering narrative rhythm and a very non-charismatic narrator. The other characters are not interesting enough to take up the slack and as a result I didn't really invest in the story. I found myself skimming to get to the good parts."
4,A Classic Read,"This historical novel revives beautifully a largely forgotten period of History: Palermo in the 12th century when the Normans had recently invaded the island and society was still divided between the previous governing class (the Arabs) and the new one (Norman-led). A story of intrigue and passion, it delivers many moments of pleasure for the reader - unfortunately, it's a little too 19th century-like in its long, overwrought descriptions and one would wish for the action to speed up. Also, when it does speed up at the end of the novel, the intrigue becomes so complex that it (nearly) defies understanding...Hence, regretfully, the 4 star rating. Regrestfully, because this is a truly talented writer."
1,A novel of boredom in the 21st century,"I can't even get past the first several chapters. The writing is not bad, but you could care less about the characters. If I am alone on an island with nothing else to read, I might try and finish.....no, I would not even do that. Boring, boring, boring. Don't waste your money."
3,OK,"I'll cut to it - the best advice in this book is - the most important thing a manager can do is hire good people. While it seems intuitive, it struck me and changed the way I view personnel placement and management of an organization. 'Good Enough' people wont make your organization more efficient. This was solid advice considering a manager of a large organization can get lost in the multitude of 'critical' things to focus on, depending on what book you read. This simple focus, when put at the forefront has had tremendous results for me.The book was ok, a lot of common sense, and fairly straight forward. Not sure it's worth the price."
3,Too short to be insightful,"Although several good tips are provided, few of the chapters are long enough to be insightful and hence very helpful.It may be good for a beginner though."
3,Monday morning leadership,The book was ok. Would I recommend it? Yes to a certain group of people. I don't feel it had a lot of info I could use personally.
4,Monday Morning Leadership,Great easy read on management principles... I would recommend this to new managers along with existing managers and business owners. It highlights and reinforces the items we need to do more effectively.
5,Small Book with Great Value,"This book is short and easy to read, yet very insightful, packed with valuable principles, and practical! Progressively, through 8 mentoring sessions, one for each Monday Morning, you will learn practical ways to apply essential leadership principles. This is an excellent book on leadership and mentoring that you can't afford to miss!"
5,Well written and easily digested,"This book is one of the few leadership books which provides vital information without complicated, unnecessary filler material. I enjoyed it very much and recommend it."
2,Very Little Information,This CD presented a few tips with very few details presented in a cutesy way that pads the small amount of information presented to span 1 1/2 CD's.There are many better CD's/books to help you improve your management techniques.
5,Simple teachings...very practical...must read!!,I would recommend this book to every Christian person who wants to be a leader with integrity. You need to read it!
5,To Bob...,"Reviewer: Bob (CA USA) - See all my reviews""This CD presented a few tips with very few details presented in a cutesy way that pads the small amount of information presented to span 1 1/2 CD's.There are many better CD's/books to help you improve your management techniques"".What part about short and concise didn't you get? This book is meant for those with little time to read, but still seeking knowledge. It's meant as a quick read, not an indepth study...Those other cd's/books are longer, more time consuming, and are completely worthless to those with little time...hence...this book/cd."
2,Poorly Written Fiction,"This book is actually a fictional first-person account of meetings with a family friend. With an M.A. in English, I've read my share of fiction, and this book is among the poorest attempts at fiction that I have ever read. The book is essentially a short list of leadership guidelines, but expanded to the length of an 80-page book (plus 25 pages of prologue, recommendations of the book by a number of other relatively unknown authors and CEOs of companies I'm not sure are still in existence, and so on) through painfully amateurish narration. This is the sort of unsubstantiated writing on leadership that holds the whole field back from establishing itself as a valid field of study--""pop psychology"" at its very worst. Readers looking for a fairly accessible guide to leadership that is research-based should turn to Kouzes's and Posner's work ""The Leadership Challenge."""
2,Waste of money,"I recently purchased this ab toner and used it maybe three times until I noticed it's losing it's volume. I know noticed it has a hole at it's seam and not a small one. I will return it today.The other thing is it's bad handling with the pump. I can't say if other people do have the same problem but it takes ages to get the pump into the right angle to actually pump the air inside.Like almost everything which is manufactured from Everlast, buy the more expensive brands because Everlast produces cheap stuff."
2,A huge disappointment,"I had previously read Me and Mr Darcy and thought I'd give this a go. However, I have been struggling to finish it. For chick fiction it is very long winded and the best part of the story happens in the flashback section early on. There is a lot spent on set up and links that are in the end pointless and don't develop the characters much. I remembered half way through why I only liked Me and Mr Darcy, it is her writing style. Great ideas over worked. If you are looking for a fun light read, avoid this and read something like Twenties Girl by Sophie Kinsella instead."
2,Boring,"This story has been done time and time again. Don't waste your money. Humor was forced and trite, book was way too long."
5,"The Only Reason To Watch ""Daze Of Our Lives!!!""","In his movie we have Paul Le Mat who plays the leader of a group of bikers known as 'The Bourne Losers"". These guys spend their days riding the highways and the byways of America in search of ""A Good Light Beer"". I can most surely relate to that. This movie also stars Eileen Davidson who appears in skimpy lingerie which is about the only reason I would ever watch 'Daze Of Our Lives"". This movie is PEFECT Drive In Movie Fare!!!"
5,"Break out the ""movie helper!""","It's so bad, it's funny. It's so funny, it's good.You'll be singing the songs for years to come."
2,Bully NB-113 Stainless Steel Side Step,"When i recieved the product it was not what the picture showed it would be. There was only one curved end on the Bully Bars, whereas the picture showed two curved ends. Also when i tried to mount them the brackets did not line up at all. As it turns out, i ordered bars for a 1999 Chevy Silverado and received bars for a 2001 GMC Envoy. I really don't think i will try this again from the internet."
1,"It will scratch your 7D, camera still twists a little","I have purchased this product to work with my Stroboframe Pro bracket and my Canon 7D for wedding work. There's no cushioning of any sort (cork) provided with this product. (I had used cork strip from my previous Anti Twist Plate)Camera was not completely stabilized and was still twisting a little. Plate had scratched 7D's paint, metal is showing.This product will have an impact on resale value of your camera, I would recommend to avoid it."
4,Solid product,"Perfect fit to the Warn XT winch for my UTV. I couldn't use a fixed mount because of my Bobcat's front end hydraulics, so using the 2 inch rear receiver hitch was the only option. would have liked to have a mount for an electrical connection for the winch power. also the hitch pin for the receiver bar has a very short arm (about an inch) which means it doesn't have much to grab onto when you want to remove it. I replaced it with a standard one."
4,It is what it is,"I was looking for a plush, pink elephant, and that's exactly what I got. Don't get this if you are not looking for a plush, pink elephant. The toy is educational insofar as it gives you an approximate idea of what an elephant looks like, though it may be misleading as elephants in the wild are not pink. Nor are they plush. The toy is about as fun as you'd imagine a plush pink elephant would be, which for me is fairly enjoyable. I'm not entirely sure on the elephant's durability. I've never really liked the durability question on these reviews, as you are not allowed to review something a long time after you've bought it. That being said, I believe the elephant will last quite a while on my fiance's dresser without decomposing or bursting into flames. Overall, I would recommend this toy to anyone looking a plush pink elephant."
4,But why so expensive?,"Can't go wrong with one of these little stuffed elephants. I recommend getting a few at a time- google ""Winks the Elephant""But- come on- why is this one listed at over $60? Does it crap out additional stuffed animals? What gives."
2,Muddled,"This book was pretty disappointing. Not really an enjoyable read. Doesn't seem to be any reason to believe any of the things he says. It all comes across as a bunch of opinions with his own thrown in there as well. Also has the annoying habit of saying ""Next we're going to talk about X"". You get to the next section and he says, ""Now we're going to talk about X"". I've read ""The Cambridge Quintet"" which was a very enjoyable discussion of the philosophy of AI. Also Godel, Escher, Bach is an excellent read for philosophy. I was hoping to get a concise overview of current practices and the reasoning behind them. It didn't happen."
2,Todd Edwards - New Trends Sounds 2004,"One of the best things about Todd Edwards' tracks is that they're so easy to mix -- their tempos vary minutely, if at all, and the cut-up garage that he specializes in help ease the transitions. I hope that Mr. Edwards gets a good chance to listen to his mix album _New Trend Sounds 2004_, because I'm convinced that he'll hear how much he needs to add some diversity to his sound. That's the Todd Edwards conundrum -- on their own, each track is great. Mixed all together, they sound exactly the same."
4,Great for the basics!,"If you are as clueless about football as I was, this is the book for you. It covers the very basics so you at least get a basic understanding of the game. I always wondered why everyone got so excited about ""downs"". I thought touchdowns were what you got excited about. I understand now. This book got me hooked on football. It's just a primer. If you want more details after reading it, there are other books out there. Of course, just watching the games will help too."
4,Very good but too short,"The DVD did a great job of explaining the basics of electricity, how circuit breakers and GFCI outlets work, explaining Amps, Volts and Watts, short circuits, using the correct gauge wire, etc...They gave good safety warnings about what to do before starting work and showed how to test for live current.The actual practical tutorials were on how to install or replace electrical outlets, GFCI outlets, how to replace light switches and how to replace a light fixture.The information was presented really well but I would have liked it to have been a little longer and to have covered more topics.It could still be very useful for anyone who just wants to know how to replace outlets, switches and light fixtures."
3,The basics of household wiring,"The material was decent, but somewhat on the remedial side. I was looking for something a little more informative and hands-on about the various aspect and practices of wiring and installation of fixtures."
5,Excellent DVD,"This wiring DVD was exactly what I needed. I am no electrician, but now I know how to talk their language, not to mention, do it myself if I want to. I've watched the program several times and it is excellent. It answered a lot of questions I had. It sure is a lot easier watching how something is done instead of reading about it in an electrical manual. Would I recommend this tutorial to someone? Absolutely. It is probably the best how-to program I've ever seen. I wish I had a dozen of these."
3,Good album but Halford remakes are better,I thought it was a good solid album with some good songs but kind of tony and not much bass. The Halford Crucible and Live Insurrection are the real hot ones in my opinion. Again if you have a massive stereo this might not apply to you but I don't have anything fancy and this was my feeling on the album.
3,Decent but not essential,"After Rob Halford's departure from Judas Priest, he went on to have a somewhat relevant solo career, and this album fits nicely into that. It may not be necessary to own this but if you are a fan of Halford you will find plenty to like on here. Nothing about this album screams at me to recommend it to anyone unless they are already a Judas Priest or Rob Halford fan. If you stumbled onto this page out of curiosity and and are not already a fan, you may want to skip it. Otherwise you will be treated to a solid album from a man that already has so much amazing material under his belt that it could go easily unnoticed."
3,"In This Fight, There Are Some Hits and Many Misses...","War of Words is an overall good effort from Rob Halford. The parts of War of Words are undoubtedly stronger than the whole. The first three tracks are amazing. Into the Pit is just a flat out metal anthem and one of the best things Halford has ever done. Nailed to the Gun, Life in Black, and War of Words are all hits as well. The rest of the album is not very good. Halford was obviously trying to make a statement that his band was going to rock harder than Priest ever dared. The result is an uneven record with some gems sprinkled in. Halford's vocals are amazing(as always) but the magic just isn't there. Pick up Halford's Resurrection and Live Insurrection before this one. Recommended for Hardcore completists only."
5,Excellent,"Rob Halford with a new band including Priest drumnmer Scott Travis is amazing. I first became acquainted w/ Fight on Halford's Live Insurrection. The Fight songs were some of the best on the album. Rob copies Painkiller-era Judas Priest. This is a good thing. Painkiller is one of the best/the best Priest album, and had a sound distinct from any other release. When people think of Rob Halford, they think of Painkiller, etc. It's the voice- he's best when he uses his high pitched shriek as opposed to mid-range melody. Halford's shriek is quite different than King Diamond and he doesn't use it as much. If you're a fan of Judas Priest or Halford, do yourself a favor and pick up this Fight CD."
5,A Great History of Stand-Up,"Very possible the best book ever written about the history of stand-up comedy. Better on the 1960s than the more modern chapters, but a great read all around."
4,Just Got It,"He looks nothing like Elvis, sounds nothing like Elvis, but there is a certain charm to listen to someone attempting to interpret the King of Rock n Roll and fail miserably. Yale-house Rock is my favorite from the disc (""Little Yoie blowin on slide trombone"")."
1,One star cuz there are no negative stars......,I'm sure thie king is rolling around in his grave because of this guy. I have heard imitators before and at least they come remotely close. I have heard all kinds of foreigners sing all kinds of songs but this is by far the worst. If you like Weird al kinds of music then buy this for a laugh. If you can get it free then thats the way to go. If you have a craving for Elvis listen to Terry Buckwald.
1,Scratches and Bubbles,"While the product arrived on time in attractive packaging, the product itself was a complete disappointment. First, the screen protector was scratched right out of the package. I figured not big deal since it's going to get scratched anyway. Well, after following the steps to adhere the screen, I was left with multiple airbubbles. I was able to remove some of them with the plastic tool included for that purpose. Finally when I followed the last step to ""PULL TAB (2)"" it made the air bubbles worse.Overall, don't waste your money or time. Get some disposable screen savers and save yourself the hassel."
4,Does the Job...,"Followed the directions to a T. Noticed there was a scratch on it before I even touched the protector (supposed to be scratch-proof). Cannot get rid of the tiny bubbles on all four corners of the screen, but they're not that noticeable so I guess it'll have to do. Rated item four stars because it is effective at protecting the screen aside from the aesthetic problems."
5,It was a gift,"These were given as a Christmas present. The person who received this item loved it. He's happy, so I'm satisfied."
4,Great Buy on Brand Name,"Great Price on Dickes Bib overalls, savings from store prices and even better with free shipping if possible."
2,Size Matters,"I always buy the same size and type of overalls and this is the first time ordering this pair from Dickies. They are very stiff and tight fitting. They should have actually been baggy on me, being the size that they were."
5,Definitely order a couple sizes up,"This is a good pair of overalls, thick denim, triple stitched...will probably last me a few good years out in the yard.But, like others have said, order them at least a size or two than what you would normally wear for jeans. For instance, I wear a 34X32 Wrangler regular fit (""five stars""...the Target/Walmart variety), and I ordered these overalls in 38X32...I'm sure glad I did. They fit perfectly after a few washes."
4,Good price true fit for me,I was worried after the reviews that my size would be too small. I typically buy Levi jeans. I bought the same size as typical and they fit well. We'll see after a few washes what happens.
2,Sizing is wrong,"Like most of the other reviewers noted, ""order the next larger size as they tend to run small."" The real reason they appear to run small is that they are not made in the United States, and the sizing is backwards from what we are used to seeing. For instance, I ordered a 34X32. Since I usually wear a 32 waist, I took everyone's advice and ordered a 40"" waist since in the U.S. we size men's garments with waist size first and length second. Well, guess what? The length of these is exactly 34"" and the waist is just right, maybe a little snug, but almost perfect. Since it's really difficult to measure the waist size accurately, it's easy to measure the inseam and it's definitely 34"" right on the button. And I have to turn about a 4"" cuff on them (I normally order 32 length in denim because they shrink at least an inch with repeated washings and I really need a 31 length or less). Anyway, I have to return them and get a much shorter size."
3,sizes vary,For me these are the best overall value however I always order the same size some fit loose some fit tight.
2,"denims ok, delivery came too late","This item was ordered at least ten days before Halloween , regular delivery. It was for a Mario Brothers costume my son intended to wear. It came two days after Halloween. Amizon delivery dates are inaccurate, so If you need it by a certain date , don't use Amazon."
5,GREAT FEEDBACK ALLOWED,execellent thnxk already sent others an others love it also good job need to work on response guide here not xcepting short reviews otherwise great work on product
4,fit,"The bibs were great. I love them. The only thing is I wish they would have come in odd sizes, I needed a 33 inch waist. 34 would have been to big and the 32 inch waist, I can't hardly button the top side button. I know, lose an inch, (smiling). Otherwise I love them. Thank you. Greg McGinnis"
4,Dickies Denim Bib Overalls,"Just what I was looking for. Perfect sizing, color & appearance. Comfort is always an impotant factor & these are so comfortable."
3,Fit runs EXTREMELY small!,"I am having to return my order and reorder these, which is very disappointing (and expensive). I have worn size 30/32 for many years in jeans, overalls, etc (and smaller in Carhartt's). I bought these in 30/32 and they are as tight as sausage casings. I am returning them for 32/32 and hoping for success... but still concerned and dubious about what I'll receive."
1,Bib Overalls,"I ordered overalls from Dress Code Clothing. They were prompt. They did not fit correctly, mailed them back by registered, certified mail on 8-13-10, stating what size was needed. Received the green card back and have not had a word from them since. I absolutely will not use them again. I will write to them concerning this order. Thanks for caring.Peggy Shoemaker"
3,cut weird,"If someone orders a large size, the bibs should be cut to provide lots of room. These aren't. They are cut too tight through the hips, and I would have returned them had I not washed them first. Live and learn."
1,Baggy and to big,It would be nice if the company selling these things gave some more info on sizing and some pictures. They only show a picture from the waste up. These bibs are baggy as can be and do not fir right at all. I am a 32 length on every pair of pants I own so I ordered a 32. These are at least 4 inches to long on me. The waist im swimming in to. The part that sucks most is that its not worth returning these bibs because it would wind up costing as much as getting a new pair. This is a disgrace.
1,Worse than a waste of money!,"I have used , and respected, Farberware cookware most of my life. It has laways been a durable, reasonably priced product. When I received this item, I was amazed that Farberware would lower themselves to put their name on it. It is cheap, shoddily assembled plastic, with a coarse threaded ( complete with burrs ) cap that leaks around the threads. On day 2 of ownership, this piece of junk found it's new home in a dumpster at work."
1,YUK,"This clock has huge numbers on the face. However, one must hit the snooze bar to see the numbers. Kind of useless at night. I really would like to just roll over and see the time. However, you must find the clock and hit the snooze to see it. Ridiculous. I do not recommend it."
2,Not recommended,"I can not recommend this clock. It is mostly fine but there is no way to stop the alarm from ringing.One of the highlights of my week is when I get to turn the alarm off first thing on Friday morning and not have to worry about the alarm until Monday.With this clock, the alarm will ring every day. There is a switch with AL ON and OFF but that turns a Z on and off on the display. I am guessing this is the snooze feature. Even with the AL in the OFF position, it still rings. I will have to take the battery out in order to sleep it on the weekend.The fact that there were two in the box and I only ordered one does not make up for the very bad design.That I ordered an Elgin clock and got a Timex is just confusing.Not good."
5,excellent turn around,Great turn around from the time of Purchase to when rcieving it..... Please feel comfortable dealing with this vendor******
3,Outside: From the Redwoods,About the only part that I liked was towards the end. The first part pretty much on the jazz side. 5 star performer.
5,Awesome performance that you don't want to miss!,"The video contains interviews of the famous violinists and behind-the-scene shots. It's just a marvellous performance! I wish I were there to attend the concert which has the best violinists of all time! I especially like the performance of Isaac Stern and Gil Shaham for the Bach Concerto in D minor for two violins and Vivaldi Concerto in B minor for four violins. All in all, I really enjoy this video and highly recommend to anyone who loves violin!"
3,Action figure,This was too expensive for a action figure. This price should be wayyyyyyyyy lower than what they sold this toy for.
5,SOngs of December,"Excellent CD. Soft, peaceful, and realxing music of the holiday season that can be played all year long!"
1,Wrong Book,I thought that I was getting the actual book instead of the EViews so I obviously didn't like this one.
4,Lighting spawns killer leeches,"Fans of Shaun Hutson's ""Slugs"" and ""Breeding Ground"" will probably enjoy this and it makes a perfect companion piece to those. Yes, the ending was a bit of a letdown, but that's mostly because there's so many deaths/attacks up to that point that the climax did seem rather miniscule and rushed. There's also some in-jokes that lighten the mood but at the same time just makes the reader envision the author patting himself on the back, which momentarily took me out of the story. Also, the words spoor and annelid did become a bit tiring after constantly popping up. Still, it's a pretty good book (for fans of this stuff) that I'll eventually read again."
2,Hard as a rock...BUT....,"I'd have given these four stars for flavor IF they had not been hard as rocks. To be fair, I DID buy them on clearance here and Warehouse Deals did give me a refund...if you suck on these for a very long time, they are tasty. It's just that you could break a tooth if you tried to chew on them right out of the package. I am thinking they are probably just old stock and fresh ones would be chewy and lovely. The flavor is good and they are adorable."
2,made water murky,Have to change the water too often after using this product. Very strong smell and it made the water murky.
4,better than flakes,"flakes seem to fall apart quickly, making a mess of the tank. These crisps are much better and the fish seem to like them just fine. I really like these and haven't found a dry food I like better."
1,st. johns white camelia parfum,"PLEASE TELL THE PUBLIC THAT THIS ITEM ""IS NOT"" THE MUCH SOUGHT AFTER ST. JOHN ""ORIGINAL"" (NO LONGER PRODUCED). ONE RUINED CHRISTMAS.JIM DEMIK"
1,classic junk sold in America,tried putting this piece of junk together...the holes barely lined up..unable to screw several of the allen wrench screws(why allen screws?) to connect the sides as the holes did not line up... why do these companies sell us such junk and are we fools enough to buy this stuff?
2,disappointed,"I should have read the reviews first - parts were missng! Call to the company was never answered. E-mails were ignored. Luckily, a $15 investment in parts from Home Depot made it usable. What a sucky company!!!"
1,Missing Parts,"I ordered the Strathwood All Weather Wicker Storage Box twice. The actual box looks nice. Both were missing a rod to hold the top to the bottom of the box. Part ""G"" in the instructions. I called the company and they stated they were made in China and replacement parts were not available. With out the part, the box would not open and close properly. After 2 tries, I decided it wasn't worth the hassle to try a third time. Unless you like packing up heavy boxes for return, I would avoid this product!!"
3,Missing parts/two-tone color/difficult to put together,"Got this last night and took 1.5 hours to put together. The metal holes didn't line up with the screw placement. A little hammering did the trick. But still difficult. Got down to the last part, the lid, and realized a piece was missing. Missing one grey sleeve on the left hinge to hold the screw in for the rod. Left a message for the company. Also noticed that the front panel was half one color and half another. Not dramatically different but enough to notice. The price was right but I got what I paid for. Hope you have better luck."
2,Not waterproof!,"I read all these reviews..and they all say that it keeps the water out..and that they got a good deal on it..well..it is currently 200 and that is not a good deal..so..I wonder what they paid.I bought 2 of them from lowes..on sale for 50 and 40 respectively...same item..and...The first one..I used on the deck...It does not keep the water out..all the time.I have tried readjusting the velcro liner many times..and it still leaks.we get very heavy rains here in Florida..and..I have to dump the water out of the liner about once a week...so...I did use the other one inside as a yarn storage bench..and I put pillows on it..to make it a seat.The inside one..works great ..and is very attractive and strong seating..but, the outside one..which still looks great after 2 months...has to have a waterproof cover put over it in rain storms."
2,It seemed like a good idea at the time - save your money,"I purchased this whisk and the flat version 3 years ago. Once a year, I pull them out of the drawer in an attempt to prove my money was not wasted on this purchase.These whisks have a very soft silicon coating on the beater portion that tends to drag on the non-stick surface of the pans. It is like you are dragging rubber against rubber. There is way too much friction to actually whip anything in a pan. It definitely does not work well in a mixing bowl - there is too much friction.PROS:- Soft silicon coating on the beater will not scratch.CONS:- Beater is way too flexible. It can not be used effectively to whip any ingredients.- Soft silicon coating creates a drag against any surface which it comes in contact.SUMMARY:These silicon whisks can not replace a regular stiff wire whisk. If you are worried about scratching your pans use wooden spoons and spatulas."
2,The whisk has way too much flex,"The first time I saw one of these I could hardly wait to take it home to try it. It's perfect for egg whites but I was looking for a non-metal whisk that was a little more versatile. There is way too much flex in the wires that it is too flimsy for use with any sauce,no matter how thin it may be. I much prefer nylon whisks for batters and sauces."
3,"Certainly not one of her best, but a nice diversion","I agree with the reviewer who referred to this novel as a 260-page coming-out novel. I also agree that it reads more like late 1990's lesbian relationship than 1980. For a more accurate picture of lesbian relationships and coming out in the early 80's, read Annie on My Mind, written during that time. Once you've read that novel, you will realize just how utopian and false this novel reads (for the time in which it is supposed to be set). I found it easier to get into the novel by just switching the time in my head. Brown does write an incredibly steamy sex scene or two, and the characters exude that Southern charm Brown writes so well. This novel does not rank among her best but was enjoyable."
2,The research is lacking,"As someone who graduated from William and Mary in 1979, about the same year that some of the characters in this book are supposed to have graduated, I had a hard time with the fundamental lack of understanding of the W&M; experience displayed in the book. In particular, the football team (and a major character is a football star) was not considered to be a dominant and organizing force at the College. In fact, many people in my class remember protesting at Board of Visitors meetings when the board was considering expanding the football stadium in order to accommodate an expanded football program that would play bigger and better teams. We didn't want it. Rich football star boyfriend? Oh, puh-lease.It may be a small thing to point out, but, if you're going to set a book in a particular location at a particular time, it would take next to no effort to do a little research to see what was going on there at that time."
5,Rita Mae's BEST!!,"""Alma Mater"" is a wonderful effort by Rita Mae Brown. In this book she explores and explains the many kinds of love and relationships that women and men can experience.It is beautifully, humorously, and sensitively written.I have read almost everyone of her Mrs. Murphy, and Sister Jane books.This one takes a completely different tack, which is a testament to her great talent.""Alma Mater"" is full of love, sex, passion, compassion, acceptance, and great humanity.I highly recommend it, and may read it again for the sheer joy of it!"
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"i have read this book a number of time. it is well written, passionate and sexy. the story is fast and compelling. it leaves a playful, sexy taste in your mouth."
2,Poor Choice for a first Brown read,"The story behind this book could have been good, however, the dialog and storytelling techniques are just completely sub-par.I was attracted to the plot of the story, and within the first few chapters I realized it was a waste of my time. I finished the book, but I was left wanting. The characters are all one-dimensional, the ""surprises"" are no surprise at all, and the epilogue was an unnecessary waste of time which wouldn't have even been necessary had the book delved any further than superficial sitcom levels."
5,Out of the Desert,"Out of the Desert by John Blundell is an exciting personal account of the experiences of an American hero during World War II. The book provides insider information about a strategic air battle that played a key role in turning the tide of the war in Europe. The accounts of Mr. Blundell's experiences are told in away that made me feel as if I were hearing them from an old and trusted friend. I was also fascinated by the author's encounters with world leaders, and celebrities. I found it very difficult to put the book down."
4,Versatile and Comfy!,"At first thess Jessica Simpson flats were a little painful because I have wider feet and the elastic around the edges was uncomfortable, but I broke them in relatively quickly and now they're so comfortable. They're great day and night shoes, and are a great alternative to heels if you hate wearing them almost as much as I do!"
2,Cute & Sassy...NOT so COMFY!,"While this shoe is adorable, and great for almost any outfit, it tends to pinch the toes, and rub against the heal...even if you buy the right size. I have very narrow feet, and it even pinch my toes, so people with wide feet BEWARE!"
2,I wouldn't recommend,"Not well made. Very cute idea in theory, but there isn't much to the shoe. No support at all, very uncomfortable."
4,Pendaflex reinforced file folders,"These are good folders - the reinforced tabs make them a bit more expensive, but they also ensure that the folder generally does not get ""dog-eared"" and look sloppy. These are folders I take to customers and one of the purposes of having the folders (aside from the obvious use of organizing materials) is to convey to the customer that we are organized and prepared. A sloppy looking folder conveys the opposite.One caveat - we ordered the 1/3 cut tabs which means each tab is 1/3 of the width of the folder in length. We use Dymo labels to label the files, and the label is a tiny bit longer than the tab. When we reordered we got the 1/2 tab which extends half way across the top of the folder, and I much prefer this configuration."
3,Interesting Book,I look forward to reading this from the Indian perspective. All other books are from the white settler perspective and I am glad to have something to see the other side.
1,not a CD,I was disappointed in this because it was a cassette instead of a CD.. I dont have a cassette player in my car or even own one. so I needed buy a cassette player to listen to these tapes.
5,Information on Bryce Wilson,"Bryce also used to be part of Mantronix (for all you '80s music fiends), and he also produced ""You're Makin' Me High"" for Toni Braxton's second album (he's also in the video as a pizza delivery guy). I don't know what he's been up to since producing that single."
1,One Hit Wonders,"I love these duo singers there fresh and new, they have such creativity in them but I have to be honest this album is terrible, the only song I actually enjoy listening to is ""Tell Me"" the rest of the tracks are boring and repetetive, the first track is the only track I will actually maybe listen to without probably skipping over it like the rest. ""Tell Me"" was their only single to reach the top 10 billboard hot 100 singles chart in the mid 90's, after there success with their first single they rushed out their self-titled album wich bombed and debut at the bottom 60 of the Hot 100 Billboard album charts. I maybe wrong, some of the other reviewers seem to really loved this album. But I urge you that if you want to get this album just because of ""Tell Me"" DONT! Go and grab a Various Artists album with there song in it like ""Monsta Jamz"" available on Amazon.com, or listen to the sample tracks on the groove theory album you could listen to and maybe you'll see what I mean."
1,This Album Seems Somewhat Different,The version of baby luv on this album is a different version than the remixed song you may have heard before. Tell me is the only song I liked on this album but like some of the other reviewers you may find more to like with this album.
2,Borderline pedestrian soul-groove,"I think the recommendation engine is fixed, or these guys paid for placement. Generally I go for electronic, dance, techno stuff. I like music with a groove latin or funk, but this album basically is to my ears in that bland top 40 black soul with female vocalist genre. Nothing that interesting going here to my ears."
4,Classic,I heard a cut from this CD on satellite radio and found it on Amazon.The music and lyrics are really timeless. I was surprised to find this first came out in 1995.
2,"The book is good, but do not deal with this company!! Shipping took it for more than two weeks!! waiting forever for this book!!","They should have a better shipping system.This is 21st century, It shouldn't take no more than 10 days."
1,"Tough subject, poor textbook.","Very difficult to correlate the line drawings with the blown-up grayscale CT slices, which just don't seem to look the same as the real thing. The Sagittal MR slices in chapter 2 are exceptionally difficult for the intended audience to follow.Factual and typographical errors occur throughout this text, such as identifying the vertebral foramen as the trachea on page 55.It seems like there could have been a better effort to develop the reader's understanding of 3D anatomy, rather than the brief review of freshman anatomy that is given.Instructors, please don't inflict this torture on your students."
3,Somewhat confusing,This book has MRI images and CT images that are not great for sectional anatomy. They could do have done a better job.
1,waiting,Still waiting for a credit since I returned this book weeks ago. I ended up not needing it for the course =and it is not something I would read for pleasure!Please get me my credit!!
1,"Propagandistic, biased psychobabble","Previous reviewers have said it all, so I'll just sum it up: Mrs. Hodges' only motive to write this book was obviously her deep hatred toward Franco. In line with other apologists of the deeply flawed, undemocratic Republican rule, she glosses over the outrages and injustices committed by the Spanish Republican government but spends an inordinate amount of time analyzing - in a rather silly psychobabbly fashion - every single episode in Franco's life which may reveal ""sinister"" connotations. This strange book tries very hard to uphold the myth of the Spanish Civil War as a good fight against ""fascist"" totalitarianism. In fact, it was Franco who fought for independent Spain against Stalinist totalitarian dictature."
5,A real live critical biography,"I expected some type of revisionary bio since I've never really read much good about Franco in other books anyway. This bio though did a complete axe job on the dictator and I was left wondering why Spain always seems to have Torquemada like figures in important government positions. I really started getting that ""inquisition"" feeling with all the shootings and persecutions during Franco's reign, that were described in digested yet graphic detail. My only question after I read the book was just how many years did Franco's reign set Spain back? 5 years or a century or two? Ouch!! I can see why some might not particularly agree with the author's brutal representation of the short squat Generallismo."
1,patetica....,"descrpcion del español mas grande del siglo XX, el unico que vencio al comunismo en los campos de batalla, el unico."
5,First-rate!,"Had this unit a couple of months and really happy with it. We've tried a few of these BP monitors, and this is by far the best. Easy to use, reproducible, comfortable, plenty of features (averages for each of 2 users, morning and evening averages, others) and durable. The first unit we bought over 5 years ago was a Panasonic unit and it still works, though the Velcro on the cuff wore out. The electronics in 3 other units that we bought all failed during this time! The Panasonic just keeps on tickin'"
1,Not accurate,I bought this but just returned it. Readings were inaccurate. I took it to the doctor's office and compared the results... sure enough doctor told me to get a different one. I cannot recommend it to anyone else...
2,Accuracy went way off after 2 months,"I really liked this unit for many reasons and the accuracy had been superb, but after 2 months the systolic reading went anywhere from 20-40 points high. Since the unit had been so accurate and trusting I was on the verge of increasing my meds when I went to the Dr. and found out my BP was OK. I had used it over 300 times and already changed the batteries when this occured. I installed another set of batteries just to check but this didn't help.I hate to rate this monitor low, but with a reading of 40 points high, this can be dangerous if one actually increases their meds as a result. Even if only short term until one can see the Dr.Too late to send back to Amazon, so I'll see what Panasonic will do. Meanwhile I've ordered the Panny EW3122S arm monitor as I still like Panasonic products.kd"
1,Panasonic Flat Panel Arm Blood Pressure,"I'm unsure about this product. It rates both my husband and me as having very high blood pressure. Neither of us has had such high scores in the past. Until one of us sees the doctor to compare, I am withholding a positive rating."
1,HORRIBLE,"I was so excited to get these earrings for Christmas, my best friend purchased them for me off my wish list. I loved the way they looked in the picture and they didn't have size specifications but the picture looked as if they were at least 3/4"" to an 1"" in length. When I opened the package, I could not even find them they were so tiny. The entire earring is the length of my thumb nail -literally, and you cannot even see the stones! I don't know where this picture came from but it's magnified quite a bit. I do not write bad reviews and I am very fair on all my purchases but these were really horrible and I was extremely disappointed when I saw them. NOT worth the price or effort put forth to receive them. These will be returned and I will not purchase from this seller again!"
1,Terrible,"This is the worst antivirus system I have ever used. Panda or Norton are far superior. Contrary to the previous reviewer, I have issues with Mcafee activating features that I do not want it to use, and have disable multiple times, and often stalling my computer by unnecessarily asking me to approve multiple files from the same source, such as a CD that I willingly installed. Look elsewhere, this was supported by the computer I ordered and necessary for my campus, but if you have a choice, choose something different."
2,It didn't work for me,"Mildly entertaining, but the falling in love in 3 days was not believable in this movie. It had a good set up, but Sandra Bullock's character never became endearing, and resorted to the same ""i love your family"" lines that made While You Were Sleeping such a great movie. Ryan Reynolds, Betty White, and some of the other characters were enjoyable."
4,One for the Romantic Comedy Collection,"You can't go wrong with cutie patuties Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Although the story itself is not very original the cast is great making this a great must-see romantic comedy. The cast also includes Betty White, Craig T Nelson, Mary Steenbaurgen, Malin Akerman, and Oscar Nuñez. Betty White is superbly funny.I bought this movie after having seen the movie online. This is one of those movies that I had to have a physical copy of in my DVD/Bluray collection. The movie also comes with French and Spanish Language tracks. I use the Spanish Language tracks of movies when I have family(mom, aunts, etc.) visit. Definitely a must for anyones romantic comedy collection."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It may have been a bit predictable, but that does not change the humor presented in this movie. Ryan is always great at his subtle sarcasm and wit. Sandra walks and talks like an uptight city girl (no offense) and pulls it off. Betty White is wonderful as always. I even enjoyed the location depicted in the movie, Sitka, Alaska; very serene. But lets also not forget the character Ramon! The stripper scene was hilarious. A movie does not have to have twists, turns and surprise endings for it to be enjoyable. I laughed and had fun watching this movie and I will watch it again and again."
3,The Proposal,This is a most enjoyable movie. It has enough twists to the plot to keep one watching. More like Sandra Bullock's movies of late.
2,I propose you not buy this one,"Great movie, but they advertised a digital edition I could use for my PC or IPAD. However, the code for it had expired last year... Bad advertising and I paid 10 extra for that feature. :("
3,no brainer time pass,"Seriously, how many times have we come across a story of two people who hate each other and then fall in love eventually. Of course, one of the two is tragically messed up and the other falls in love. Its an age old story in a new pot. But if you want a no brainer, a lovely romantic comedy and some very nice acting, then you are up for a treat."
5,The ULTIMATE Comedy,"One word: Hilarious.You can see this a million times and never stop laughing.All though it is a good comedy, that doesn't mean there is no good acting. FYI: AMAZING ACTING.Sandra is at her prime. Ryan is a good addition. And it was PURE JOY to see Bette Whit perform. She was hilarious-her comments and facial expressions-PRICELESS!The chemistry is perfect between all the actors on screen and that is what produced a perfect movie, as well as a perfect script.Spoilers:Good Scenes:1) Campfire scene where Bette is Indian and Sandra does a dance2) Bette fakes a heart attack3) Ryan and Sandra tell their engagement story4) Sandra and Ryan sing"
4,Typical Romatic-Comedy,"It’s a cute romantic-comedy with a typical and predictable plot, but I enjoy that type of movie. A warning to those who are downloading to HD to Kindle, make sure your internet is fast enough for HD. I purchased HD but had to download standard. It’s probably not an issue with most users. Also, you must be connected to the internet to watch; something I didn’t know."
4,Like New as Stated,"This was a great buy and was like new as the seller stated...but I am pretty sure this is a copy, not original disc since the disc loads like a DVD that I burn, not like all the new DVD's I have. Just saying..."
5,Good romantic comedy!,I love this movie. Not your typical plot.The actors are both very easy on the eyes. Especially a scene where Ryan nearly bears all. ;)Love watching this with my hubby. We have seen it a handful of times and still enjoy watching it.Watch it!
4,the proposal,sandra bullock is very funny in this movie. love the change her character goes though. Great movie for a date night.
3,"Good movie to watch if you just want to relax. Not realistic at all, kind of a fairy tale for grownups.","Good movie to watch if you just want to relax. Not realistic at all, kind of a fairy tale for grownups."
5,All around perfect,"Well written and acted and a light, funny, meaningful story, The setting is beautiful. all of the actors are perfectly chosen, Betty White is really great! another great one for Sandra"
4,Very Funny!!!,"I loved this movie when I saw it for the first time in theaters a few months ago! There is never a part where you don't laugh from start to finish, and it also has a good moral as well. I wanted to see it, because the previews looked hilarious, and I am a big Sandra Bullock fan. She is just one of the top few actresses that are truly talented, funny ,sweet, and down to earth. She also has this certain glow and charm that you can't help, but love her. This movie definitely is a romantic comedy that is at top at its game with laughter and fun! If you love romantic comedies or Sandra Bullock, you will definitely enjoy this movie!"
4,Good movie,"Very good movie. At first I was hesitant due to it being another Rom-Com but I was surprised. The backdrop is awesome and looks fantastic in 1080p. It's a funny yet a bit predictable story. All in all, it's one that has made our repeat viewing list."
1,Is It 1995?,Sandra Bullock is still stuck in 1995 in this uninspired romantic comedy where she goes through all the motions that the genre calls for with little originality.Betty White makes it all worth it with her scene-stealing turn as a grandmother. She's always one to watch for.
1,NO digital copy!!,This was advertised as the movie + a digital copy. I feel mis-lead. No digital copy was included. We will be returning it!
1,Regional error,"This is a great movie I've seen several times, however the copy I purchased from this seller has the regional code for somewhere other than the United States and I was unable to play the disks on any of my devices."
2,wrong region,"Why are there even different regions for blu rays? And why would Amazon ever send me one from a different region. Clearly shipping to us, I need a us compatible blu ray."
3,Indecent Proposal,"Generally, I liked this movie. Sandra Bullock gives her regular rom-com performance and Ryan Reynolds is passable as her assistant-turned-amour. They had absolutely no chemistry together though, and their getting together is kind of unbelievable. And that end of the movie kiss, where you're supposed to believe anything is possible? Appeared completely fake and over the top to me. All in all, a good piece of fluff to watch when you have absolutely nothing else better to do."
4,AN EASY WATCH BECAUSE OF BULLOCK AND REYNOLDS!,"It's hard to trash this predictable romance film because the stars are so appealing. While the is little new here, the film is entertaining with some good laughs. I was surprised to see Sandra Bullock in a semi-nude scene and she is looking mighty fine! Betty White adds to the fun and shows no sign of slowing down. If you like romantic comedies, you should really like this good natured film."
3,I just don't know???,"This is one of those indecisive reviews. I like Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock but the two just don't seem to mesh like say a...Kate Hudson/Matthew McConaha(SpellCheck) movie. I liked the plot and the movie had some really scenic moments when the BLU-RAY showed off but it just seemed like something was missing. Reynolds is his usual funny self but I find it hard to laugh at Sandra Bullock sometimes... she's just too serious an actress.I will probably watch again sometime cause I just don't know. I can't remember any really great parts, and that in itself is not a good thing... I am glad I bought it, it was entertaining so overall it wasn't a waste of money. Just not a great comedy..."
3,formulaic and generic,"The Proposal is an average romantic comedy. Perhaps there is more comedy than romance, but none of the comedy is particularly original or smart. No new ground is broken. If you like romantic comedies, you will probably like it; if you don't, you probably won't. The movie could serve as a commercial for Alaskan tourism (or wherever they actually filmed the Alaska scenes.) The geography was breathtaking, and there were a lot of talented actors with very little to do."
5,Love this movie,"Although it's a classic Sandra Bullock story, Ryan Reynolds really helps make this one work. Some very funny lines throughout and awkward moments had us cracking up. If you haven't seen this one yet, it's worth the rent!"
4,its a good movie,"its a rom com, of which im addicted to. cute funny movie no real surprises, but that's not why your wanting to watch it is it ?"
4,Enjoyed The Proposal,I had seen the film in theatres and really like it so I bought the DVD so I could watch it again from time to time.
2,Weak Chick Flick,"This is the quintessential chick flick. The primary roles are female. No big deal. The same was mostly true of ""A League of Their Own."" But, what's missing here is anything resembling a male with much testosterone. In addition, the character development and especially the shift in feelings between Bullock and Reynolds is lacking. For women looking for something to watch on a Saturday night ""The Proposal"" might fit the bill. On the other hand, this movie brings to bare the lyrics to the ballad ""Where Have All the Cowboys Gone."" As a guy, my only excuse for watching this movie is that my girlfriend really wanted to see it so I went along with her. That takes care of the chick flicks for a while."
2,Weird Movie,This was about some woman with a personality disorder who has a hard time holding onto her job because of it. She makes a sexual arrangement with a co-worker per doctors orders. The couple flies to Alaska together. This is where the story goes off-track. There is a lot of confusion and misunderstandings between the gentlemen's family over this woman. They're on and off boats and planes many times. It is hard to make heads or tails out of much of this film. I think it would be best suited as an art house feature.
1,The Proposal,"Well, I watched The Proposal one time. I was disappointed that such a good plot was smeared with crude actions, language that made me blush, and gross nakedness. What did I do with it? I threw it in the fire!"
2,Disappointed,"This movie was so funny! Sandra plays one of the most stuck up, rude, non caring rolls I have ever seen, and she was Great! The thing that really brought down my rating was the implied nudity. There was two parts with implied nudity and I was very disappointed with that. This was a funny movie but because of the implied nudity I will not buy it."
1,Did not rent or purchase this movie ???,"I am confused. I did not rent or purchase this product... movie or DVD I guess! So why are you asking me to review it... Please check your records and if you have charged me for this... please correct and credit back my $$$$$$. Gee, guess I should have labeled this "" review of your system""... bahahaha."
1,"Sound & Fury, Signifying NOTHING!","Well, Sandra Bullock is a favorite of mine, though I've been very disappointed by many of her films. It's not always her, it's the scripts. My favorites being Two Weeks Notice, The Net, and The Thing Called Love, in which she wasn't the star, but the film was pretty good.But this, this was about the most boring movie I ever saw. I kept fast forwarding it, hoping it would get better or thinking about turning it off, and finally it came to and end. Thank goodness. I put it back in the little box and slipped it down below in the cupboard with other movies I didn't like, hated or some boring re-runs.The plot is ridiculous, made no sense. The characters were ridiculous and made no sense. In fact, the whole movie made no sense. You've probably read the plot somewhere, so I won't bother to run through it, but unless you love bad farce, don't buy it.And PS. I don't consider this a romantic comedy."
5,Genuinely a fun and entertaining comedy,"Ok, the premise is a bit of a reach. But honestly, the movie is good enough that you don't notice at all. The main stars give a really good performance in this truely funny story. The film is very well done, and if you are looking for a comedy, you will not be disappointed with this one."
2,"Pleasant, funny, but as formulaic as algebra","If you enjoy romantic comedies, you'll probably like this movie. I did. Sandra Bullock is as charming as ever, Ryan Reynolds is bitingly funny, the supporting cast is very good, and the movie itself has enough funny moments to be worthwhile. The downside is that it is extremely formulaic and predictable. You will know what to expect from this movie from the very beginning, with every cliche played out in full. I think the cast saves the movie, they are funny enough to make it work."
2,Very disappointed,"I was so looking forward to viewing this because I like both Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds (and of course Betty White!) and I was expecting a great time since it was a huge box office hit and had good buzz. After 30 minutes, I started wondering when the hysterical moments would begin. Unfortunately they never do. Sure, there are a few scenes that are mildly funny but I found most of the film awkward and strained. The leads are attractive, the setting is gorgeous, and the photography is outstanding but the movie fails to get off the ground and the whole scenario is just unbelievable."
3,dvd the proposal,i thought I was buying a new product because that is how it was put on the sight. when I got the item it was used but I paid as if I were buying a new one. Needless to say I was not as happy as I should of been.
4,Decent romantic comedy,"Sandra shines in this movie. I have seen better chick flicks, but this was worth a rental. I did like that the movie was relatively clean compared to some."
3,I propose better scripts for Sandra Bullock!,"She really is deserving of better than this sort of frantic comedy; so are all of us. Too contrived, too forced, too everything.Cyndy K."
2,good story but not well done,"the movie script is awesome, and I also like Sandra Bullock, but in overall, movie was not well done, maybe just the first half was actually fun to watch"
1,PG-13 is too loose a rating!,"I thought that while the plot was a bit predictable it could still be a good ""chick flick."" I was very disappointed. There was a lot (as in the amount of skin) of nudity!!! Seemed like grounds for ""R"" to me. And the turn of events were so subtle that it seemed as though the affections of the couple were out of place. The nudity, however, was my biggest complaint!"
2,The Proposal + Digital Copy (Blu-ray),"I received the DVD The Proposal in October, 2011. Love the movie, but the digital copy was expired. So basically, I paid the additional money for a digital copy that had expired in April, 2011. I am very disappointed that Amazon.com did not disclose this information. I think that they should not even sell the digital copy version since it's expired. I am usually quite satisfied with my purchases from Amazon.com, but this was a huge disappointment."
4,Hilariously entertaining,"I have watched this movie sevral times and I laugh out loud every time I watch it. Sandra and Ryan are great together, The cast of this movie is outstanding I love watching Mary Steenbergen, Craig T. Nelsom and Betty White. If you enjoy well directed, good story line and fine acting you'll enjoy this movie. I get so tired of all the gory filled R rated movies these days."
4,"Cheesy, but Fun","This movie was super cheesy and predictable, but fun to watch. It is pretty clean, too. Sandra Bullock always does a good job of playing the ""tough girl"" who turns ""soft."""
4,ahmyers,"I truly enjoyed this movie. It was light hearted and very funny. Sandra dn Ryan played off of each other very well. This was a nice feel good movie and not just a chick flick, guys you will enjoy it as well. Thumbs up!!!!!"
2,Mindless,"It was hard to keep watching it. We didn't stop because it was too late tto start another movie. Otherwise, we would have bailed out."
4,Fun movie!,"Sandra Bullock is great in this flick. Betty White almost steals the show, though! Full of funny moments....Sandra's comedic timing is great."
1,Very predictable plot,This is a typical simplistic and 100% predictable Disney plot. I felt like I was watching Dora the Explorer with my granddaughters.
2,Tolerable at best.,"This was a very overhyped movie to start with. The movie showed very very little romance or comedy and it was filed under romantic comedy. I hate 99% of these style of movies but I sat through this with my gf and managed to watch the whole thing, so thats worth two stars I guess."
2,huh.,"I agree with the person who said that if you've seen while you were sleeping, you've seen this movie! Throughout the whole movie, things kept happening that happened in while you were sleeping! Like when she said she couldn't marry him at the alter, here we go again! Anyways, it was kinda annoying.."
5,In great shape as advertised,"This movie was advertised as 'practically new' and it was just that. We have watched it and it plays great, the case was perfect!"
4,Oh Sandy!,"The Proposal starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is a cute, harmless romantic comedy. Bullock is one of my favorites and parts of this film remind me of While You Were Sleeping (the movie that made her a household name). Reynolds is funny but I don't quite believe the chemistry between him and Bullock, seems kinda forced and off-kilter. The Proposal was better than expected, Sandy never disappoints!"
2,Missing something,"I love Sandra Bullock, and most of her movies. This movie was not that good. Beautiful location, beautiful people,etc... BUT there was no spark between the two leads. It just did not work. I fell asleep, rewound, and fell asleepagain. Sandra you need more serious roles, you are getting to old for the cutesy girl roles."
4,DVD The Proposal,"Having rented this movie twice, I decided that buying it made sense. I would categorize it as a ""feel good"" movie. Light, but pleasant story with wonderful performance by Betty While. There are movies that do not require suspense as to the ending, and The Proposal is certainly one of them. As usual, when I enjoy a movie which I have rented, I go to Amazon to buy it, as well as almost anything that we may need or want, or even about which we may have questions."
5,The Proposal,"I love, love, love this movie. Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds and Betty White are amazingly funny in this movie."
4,Four stars,"I'm giving this chick flick four stars rather than five stars because, although Sandra Bullock is brilliant in it, the movie isn't amoung the best I've ever seen. The story is about a high powered book editor from Canada whose visa has just run out so she needs to get married to stay in the US. She sets her sight on her PA who has no choice but to pretend that he and she are madly in love. Not a brilliant film but very enjoyable way to spend a night in."
4,Romantic Comedy,"I just watched this movie two nights ago by myself. I don't know Guys; I really think it could have been better. I really don't like the way they portrayed Ryan Reynolds's character. I'm so much happier when he can be himself or some other version of ""Van Wilder."" Sandra Bullock was funny? I don't know I think I giggle like five times through out the whole movie. The story was cute and predictable. The story is that Sandra's character is from Canada and is getting deported. Ryan's character is her assistant and is forced to marry her or loose his job. I just wish Ryan was more sarcastic and funny like he's known for. Sandra plays a good hard arss but not really believable. All in all I give this movie a three out of five. If Ryan was topless more often maybe there were be a higher score."
2,Bad even by the standards of rom-coms,"The Bottom Line:Much as I hate formula, I have a soft spot for romantic comedies because the ones which feature good chemistry between the leads always offer some interesting character interaction; that said, it is my displeasure to inform you that The Proposal hastily skips past all of that pesky character bonding--save for one scene with the two leads in their bedroom talking--to focus on the stupid formula hijinx, resulting in a pretty bad film.2/4"
4,Good movie,"Good movie. Very funny. Arrived quickly, but Blueray is starting to annoy me because there is always an issue with them. This one stuck at times on the one player but not on the other."
4,The Proposal isn't the LOL film it could've been,"I bought the Blu-ray version of The proposal for my wifefor Christmas and after watching the film, we decided itcould've been done better.The alternate ending would've made the film better. The film dragsalong during the middle and the ending wasn't very satisfying."
5,Hilarious movie,This movie is absolutely hilarious. I have seen it several times and it is always very funny. A must watch and one of Sandra Bullock's best movies.
4,A great romantic comedy,"In ""The Proposal,"" Sandra Bullock goes against her usual girl-next-door roles and plays Margaret, a no-nonsense Manhattan publishing executive her employees affectionately refer to as ""Satan's Mistress."" Unfortunately for Margaret, she's a Canadian whose visa is about to expire, and so she ropes her assistant, Drew (Ryan Reynolds), into agreeing to marry her. The fake couple carries their scheme all the way to Drew's home state of Alaska, where they inform Drew's family of the news and continue the fiasco all the way to the altar.I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did, but Bullock and Reynolds are hysterical. The film also boasts a great supporting cast, including the sassy Betty White as Drew's outlandish grandmother. ""The Proposal"" is a hilarious romantic comedy that I will definitely want to purchase on DVD and watch again and again."
2,I HOPE this isn't THE funniest movie of the year...,"I couldn't wait to see this movie! I love Sandra Bullock. I can't think of a movie of hers I haven't enjoyed. I even liked ""Miss Cong. 2 Armed & Fabulous"". Not her best but still better than The Proposal.The movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't very funny either. A few smiles maybe and ""It was cute"" at the end was about it. Her character was unlikable (that was the point, but it didn't improve much over the course of the movie) and with such a great cast, I had hoped for better. I can't really pinpoint a bunch of negatives about the movie. I just didn't like it. Not funny, their relationship progressed painfully slowly, and you just really didn't get into the movie. All the funny scenes were in the trailers."
3,Watchable,"Yeah, you've seen this kind of thing before. But the players are pleasant and Massachussets never looked better as a substitute for Alaska. That was pretty cool. A chick flick a guy can get thru."
5,The Proposal,I have never laughed as much and enjoyed a movie as much! I've watched it over and over and over. Too Funny!
5,The Proposal,I bought this movie for my wife's birthday. She laughed throughout the whole thing! It got me some good brownie points. Would recomment it for anyone who just needs a pick me up!
2,Should have saved my money,"Very disappointed. I usually like most things with Sandra Bullock but this just was not up to any standard. A real pot-boiler or as they once were called ""a B-movie"""
4,LOVE YOU BETTY WHITE!,"Yes, this is your typical chick flick. Two mismatched people, Bullock as the demanding boss that needs a husband to avoid deportation to Canada,and Reynolds as her assistant that agrees to marry her in exchange for a promotion and then it's off to meet the parents and Grandma Annie (Betty White, from The Golden Girls) and presto by the movie's end, they are in love. It's great to see Betty White still at the top of her acting game. Sorry Sandra, but Betty is the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place. Three stars for the movie, 1 additional star for Betty White for a total of 4 stars."
4,Disappointing,"The basics of this movie has been done several times before but just with a little twist. Two people pretending to be engaged for ulterior motives. Betty White stole the movie -- she was great. I was very disappointed in Sandra Bullock doing a nude scene - she's too good of an actress to have to do that. She is the boss lady and her visa is up so she needs to either marry an American or be deported. Naturally, the latter is not to her liking so she enlists the (unwilling) assistance of her assistant. As part of the ploy they have to visit his family for his grandmother's birthday (played by Betty White). At first his family is a little too country for the sophisticated boss lady but as she gets to know them, she takes another look at her too structured and perfect life and decides that she likes them. The usual last minute detractors pop up but all's well that ends well. Sandra Bullock could have done better."
4,The Proposal,Enjoyed the movie. Was not disappointed. Sandra Bullock was great. Looking forward to seeing the Blind Side also when it comes out on DVD.Amazon is my favorite source for DVD's as well as other merchandise.
3,the proposal,I don't know. I haven't got the movie yet! I would love to rate this but I don't have the movie yet!
5,Very entertaining.,I love this movie. Betty White is awesome. It's definitely a feel-good movie! It's one of Sandra Bullock's best movies.
2,Formula movie that simply is not credible,"Sanda Bullock is looking her age. Her on screen relationship with the leading man simply doesn't come across as credible. He looks about 25, and she looks all of 45. The movie hangs together like a jig-saw puzzle, with a few of its pieces missing."
1,Sub Par,"There was not much romance and not much comedy--other than forced comedy--in this movie. The chemistry just wasn't there for the main characters Andrew and Margaret. Their bickering, which was I think supposed to be funny, seemed more like real arguing and quickly became tiresome. I would have just turned the movie off, but I wanted to see if they could pull it out of the scrap heap at the end. There was one scene that made me laugh, but the rest of the movie was a wash out. If I had known it was this stupid, I would have saved myself $15. Now maybe you'll have that opportunity."
1,No Chemistry between Bullock & Reynolds,I was disappointed in this movie. There is absolutely no chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. He also looks and appears 10 years younger than her. None of the actors/actresses played their roles well. Betty White's character was a typical Betty White character but silly to the point of ridiculous. The tribal scene in the woods was pointless. Craig Nelson was not convincing as the overbearing dad. The dude from The Office who played the male stripper/minister was disgusting. I did not laugh a single time in the movie. The best thing about the movie was the Alaskan scenery.
1,Terrible script and predictable performances,"When will Hollywood stop putting out these awful rom-coms? Probably when Sandra Bullock stops playing herself.The script of this film is dire; the actors often appear embarassed delivering their lines. The plot is thin and predictable. The comedy is nothing original or even that funny. If Sandra Bullock's acting ability is deserving of an Academy Award, then it makes a farce of the whole process. Yes, I've seen The Blind Side and she's the same in that...Sandra Bullock."
1,Not one of Sandra's best movies!,"I found this movie very predictable that they were going to fall in love at the end. And find it hard to believe that they would actually fall in love over those few days at his parents house. I don't know.... it just doesn't seem like they spent enough time togather to of fallen in love. Like Jack and Rose from Titanic you could tell that they really loved each other over those few days, but I didn't get that sense of true love from this movie."
2,Nope.,"I love Sandra Bullock, but this was not one of her best roles. I don't like seeing her as the 'witch' that she portrayed. But mainly 2 stars b/c the writers didn't dwell long enough on WHY she did the 'turn around' personality. I thought this was quite dull but I truly enjoy whatever Betty White is in. She is great. Ryan Reynolds is a cutie, very sweet in this one but again, not enough story line on the transition of the hate to love scenario. They could have cut a lot of boring out and written the middle better."
2,Less is less,"Who is too timid to enter a room naked when they are the only person in the room? Who aims a boat at a buoy in the middle of a bay, and then lets go of the steering wheel 5 seconds before hitting it? Who goes to Sitka from New York for the weekend, and believes they will be back for a morning appointment on Monday? These are examples of the leaps of logic expected from viewers of this rubbish.Weak writing, poor character development, and a useless Bonus feature of a self serving narrative by the writers of The Proposal, left me bewildered and disappointed.There are huge holes in the script, making the characters seem quite clueless. I get the feeling that all the nice things that are being said about this version of the movie and the 2 disc deluxe version are being left by members of Disney's PR department, because The Proposal is a stinker. Skip it. If you are a die hard fan of the stars, rent it somewhere cheap. Don't spend more than a buck, or you will feel cheated."
2,"A ""Stitch"" not quite in time","The ""Contemporary"" of the subtitle is a misnomer. This compendium is cited as being a 2002 update of 1997's ""Creme de la Femme,"" but most of the humor here has a dated feel. My recall of '90s zeitgeist placed the general approach and style at 1994, and a glance at the back-of-the-book index of each article's original publication date confirmed that suspicion. Whether that's positive or negative is subjective. Personally, I only laughed aloud once, and that was at a sentence it turned out I'd misread to be funnier than it actually was."
1,not what I thought,"I actually wanted a book about Kwan Yin, and this book is about the I Ching. I already read the Tarot, so I'm not very interested in learning another complex divination. Had I known, I would not have bought this...so hopefully I can help someone else....if you are looking for a book about the GOddess, this is not it!"
1,Not Worth the Name,"I am very dissapointed with this book. This book does not really include any specifics on IP as mentioned on the cover. There is in reality only one chapter which covers IP, the rest of the book is more related to Physical Layer. Also there is a lack of continuity and clarity.This book is good as far as physical layer is concerned but then their other book ""Wideband CDMA for Third Generation Mobile Communications "" also covers those topics.Finally i would like to say that anyone who wants to purchase this book should first go through it before buying it."
5,Rip off for black history month,"I have kept my eyes on this for a entire year. I noticed one thing, I wasnt willing to pay 80.00 for this it was going to be used several times with adults to share with children, so I thought I would wait. Sometime in August it was down to $54.00 right here on amazon and at that time I was just about to get it. Now that it's martin luther king day and going to be black history month, the price will be HIGHER until about april and then your see a dramatic change.Keep your eyes open, people will onyl tell you what they want you to know. PBS has been asking for money for past 20 years that I can remember. One or two things should have happended. Either they got richer or they got poorer. Which one do you think happened?This is a excellent tool to teach children and adults, please note that the high price has nothing to do with PBS, it's the system designed to make you think otherwise.Please wait until this product goes down, cause it will."
1,Horrible...,"I bought these because they're flushable. The perfume is strong, which let's face it... it's not good for down there... it burns and it hurts for several minutes after using them. Whomever thought of that, wasn't too bright. Don't waste your money on Kandoos. They definitely KanDON'T.I bought Wet Ones instead and they work fantastic, no burning, no pain of any kind and they're also flushable. I wish they were the size of actual baby wipes. I also wish they'd make some that are free of fragrances but they work just fine. The best Wet Ones I found were with Aloe and they're hypoallergenic."
5,Use 'em and luv 'em and they do flush nicely,"I don't understand the complaints about flushability. We've been using them through several box-loads and never had a flushing problem. The scent is not strong and they are just the right size. Highly recommend them, as they KANDOO the job!"
1,STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT,I'm pretty upset that I placed this order on Jun 30th and still have not recieved it. Please send ASAP.Courtney Yin-LaVoie
4,A Succinct Guide to Famous Battles,"Battles: A Concise Dictionary is a useful reference work that outlines and summarizes over 500 battles from ancient times to the 1990s. For each entry, we are provided a brief description of the events in the battle, its participants, and the battle's significance. The book also includes five pages of battle maps, a chronology of weapons development, a chronology of wars and battles, and a fifteen-page overview of notable military commanders. Quotes on military strategy and the experience of war are interspersed throughout the book. Students and teachers of military, world, ancient, medieval, or European history will find this book quite helpful."
4,Great Guide Book,"This book has some great finds such as places to eat (for reasonable amounts). It talks of one place on Maui that's a community college. The students create a four course meal for only $11! It also gave us some great suggestions for where we can spend our honeymoon. I would definitely try out the bed and breakfasts over the ""canned"" travel agent resorts. Excellent resource for prices on tours & activities. I reviewed at least 6 books on Hawaii and found this one to be the most resourceful. Definitely a keeper!"
2,Eh.,"The author sees Hamlet in a completely different light than I do - I disagreed with just about every statement he made. If you want a definitive analysis of Hamlet, I recommend J. Dover Wilson's ""What Happens in Hamlet"""
4,Oswald On the Go Oswald,"Great DVD for your little one. My 3-year old loves Oswald and all of his colorful and interesting friends. I love hearing Fred Savage and ""Squiggy"" from Laverne and Shirley, on this DVD."
2,Not much here,"This DVD doesn't really contain much about the Korean War! Half of the 60 minute run time are Defense Dept. films from the 50s encouraging teenage boys to join the military.No mention of Korea at all. There are a few short news clips of inconsequential events related to the war and 1 entertaining bit of pro-US propaganda where an alleged reporter describes the destruction of Seoul by mindless deranged communists. Altogether, this DVD does not contain enough content to be sold on its own.[...]"
4,I know i'm in there somewhere,"I would recommend this book for anyone who is uncomfortable with being emotional. As a follower of Jesus, I see the references to the Larger self as the place God has in my life. Overall, it is very helpful and gives you a place to start working through overwhelming emotions that certain life events might trigger."
2,Probably the best book purchase I've ever made.,"I have read a number of ""self-help"" books over the years. Ms. Brenner's book is, without a doubt, the most moving, useful book I have ever read. I think every woman should read it. It impressed me so much that I bought copies for my daughter and all my closest friends!"
2,Not very useful,"What makes this a 'file' is the addition of a pocket to each section of the book. I normally love Caroline Cliffton-Moggs books but this one is minimally usefully. You can stick a few indeas in the book, but not a very good organizer for decorating a home."
2,"Love the cast, disliked the plot.","2 stars, one for each laugh. Read the reviews, but how could this cast make a movie that bad. They are all my favorite actors (except Tony Curtis) in one movie. Ok for a dollar I bought the movie. Watched and then put it in the give away pile. I have lots of public domain, black and white, full screen, blurry prints that I find more enjoyable to watch. A good study in how a great cast can be wasted. Tony Curtis roll in the movie (script fault) drug it down more. Hy Averback, the director has been great in hour TV shows but doesn't seem to know what to do with a 1 hour movie. Tank, with James Garner, same type plot, is much better although not a comedy, it has it light moments. MGM has to have better movies to release. Oh yes. That's right, they did with their Midnight Movies series."
5,Add this one to the classic list!,"Adore all of these actors. Had to add this to my ""classic"" list of home movies. Goofy and fun. :)"
2,Funnier in memory,"I remembered this as a really funny movie, but wasn't all that amused by it. I guess humor changes as times change."
5,.suppose they gave a war & nobody camegood seller dvd just as describe+good shipping,dvd just as describe+good seller+good shipping++ if you are a collector it worth having in your collection-bad note is it mucher harder to leave feed back at this sight I bought this movie 2 mo ago with ebay when you receve it you can leave feed back-ebay is 10 time easer
5,Comprehensive Book on Proposals,"I've got quite a few books on proposal management/writing, and this is the best one in my opinion. I found it to be the most enjoyable to read, the most comprehensive, and the most resourceful. When I moved from managing proposals at a small company of 100 people to a global firm with 7,000 people, there were a lot of new processes I needed to learn. Reading this before I started my new position kept me from looking stupid and unprepared for much more complex pursuits!"
2,Disappointing,This review written by Harold Rome was a very disappointing recording. The satire of the songs did not have the punch they might have had. The music was forgettable and the performances were adequate.
4,Great DVD to go with the book,"I think this DVD makes more sense if you've also read the book. It could be watched on it's own, but it is a bit choppy. It is a great look into debt and how it affects people. I think he may have tried to fit too much into this one DVD, but overall it's a great look at this problem. Everyone with a credit card should see this!"
3,Another great documentary with no solutions,"Information is knowledge. When it is revealed to the public many of the corporate practices, many of us get it. We can no longer make bad choices without referring back to our conscious that reminds us ""we were warned"". I would only hope that one day we get smart people to do documentaries in Part 1 of 2 and followed by a Part 2 for a solution."
4,Decent eye-opener for those who may not know,"This movie is a documentary on the lending system of the U.S., mainly on the credit industry. This is heavily weighted to the anti-credit card side of the issue, but still a well made documentary for people to see if they do not realize how bad things can get for other people. A wise girl once told me to always pay yourself first before you pay others back, and that philosophy works well, and helps build savings and assets. Along with that, if you don't ""Need it"", don't buy it, that's what the folks always said. Wise use of credit cards is possible. I lived 28 years without one, but eventually, traveling forced me to get one due hotels taking out big ""hold charges"" for rooms, being too much for my debit card. almost 3 years later, still a 0 balance at the end of most months, no interest ever paid. Many of my friends are the same. Be wise with your credit. See this film if you want to re-affirm how fortunate most of us really are."
3,The Borrower is Slave to the Lender,"I like ""In Debt We Trust More"".Proverbs 22:7 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender."
1,Propaganda,"This piece is slanted. All blame is heaped on banks, politicians, and debt collectors while consumers are not held accountable for their choices."
2,"Emotional, but lacks information","I found some very interesting parts to this movie, unfortunately I felt it just lacked enough hard information. I'd liked to have seen how, generally, the system works and what are it's major problems. Instead, they danced around this and only partially explained FICO, political influence, and hardly even touched the nation's debt and its consequences.But still, there was enough in the movie to make it worth the watch."
1,Propaganda,There was no examination of American individual's role in the credit. Biased to Democrats. After seeing this film the director could be the next Michael Moore.
2,Half of the Story,"Sure, predatory lending exists, and is immoral. But borrowing beyond your means to repay is ALSO IMMORAL. This movie highlights the former, but not the latter.If you charge something on a credit card, you are BORROWING MONEY. That money is NOT YOURS. It belongs to someone else, and it's wholly irrelevant that you don't like them because they're a greedy corporation. It's still NOT YOUR MONEY.Now, if you don't pay the money back, YOU ARE STEALING. That's right. You are a THIEF. Taking something that isn't yours and not giving it back is the definition of theft. How on earth can this movie rightfully argue that those who borrow money and don't return it are always ""victims""?Be accountable for your actions!"
4,Interesting Documentary But Lacks A Solution,Maxed Out is a documentary about the financial woes of the American People. The documentary chronicle's families problems with staying afloat in a debt ridden environment. Maxed Out was able to get some pretty big names in the financial community to agree to interviews including Dave Ramsey & Suze Orman. Although I think that the documentary makes a good case that credit card companies are taking advantage of certain families with ridiculous interest rates and fees I also believe that the DVD lacks making the case for personal responsibility when it comes to credit issues. I do not feel that stronger regulation will fix the credit problem. We live in America and should try to keep government out of any industry possible. Look what government regulation did to the airline industry. The only solution to Americas ever growing credit problem is personal responsibility and more education regarding financial products.
5,Maxed Out,"This is an excellent film! I am a professor of history at a small college in North Texas and I show it to my students as an extra-credit assignment. Many of them are shocked after they watch it. I find it to be an indispensible learning tool concerning the dangers of credit, not only for myself, but also for anyone who wants to learn more about the financial world in general."
4,Educate yourself and your children,"A great video to watch with teens/young adults to illustrate that life without debt is much more enjoyable than life with lots of stuff and the debt goes with having it all right now. Although the film shows some of the underhanded tricks of the lending institutions involved and tends to lay the blame there, the real crux of the problem is ignorance on the part of the consumer. Don't borrow unless you have a firm plan to pay it back."
2,more like a documentary,"than a helpful tool. This would most benefit high school students. If you're already ""maxed out,"" this is unlikely to help, but may make you feel better by knowing you're not alone."
1,Horrible,"Nothing new here. I could not finish this one. Synopsis: Credit card companies are evil. The consumer is not at fault. We have no control over our credit cards.There was absolutely no substance to this movie. A few interviews of people with debt, and a boring Harvard professor.I was looking for a more detailed analysis of the workings of credit card companies and the growing household debts across the country. Instead, the movie chose to focus on a select few people, with rather mundane stories. The people interviewed were simply boring. The title is MAXED OUT, interview some people with some MAXED OUT stories."
1,Maxed Out is Totally Political,"We found Maxed Out to be incredibly political, blaming most of the problems on Pres Bush, the Republicans, and of all people Jerry Falwell. You have to watch it with an open mind to see the slant. No one that had bad credit and debt was responsible in the producer's eyes ....just those nasty credit card companies. Liberal Senators were of course portrayed as ""caring for the Downtrodden"". This could have been a great teaching tool for the people in debt or thinking about going in debt by explaining interest, etc."
1,never received product,"I never received this product although I waited ample time allowing for holiday mail. Since there is no phone number to contact a customer rep and no easy way to e-mail, I have asked my credit card provider to charge back the fee and they agreed. You are entirely too difficult to reach. I mentioned the fact that I had not received this product when I rated the other dvd I ordered at the same time and I tried an e-mail address and reported that I had not received the dvd but no one has ever contacted me. I will think long and hard before I order anything through Amazon again because it is too difficult to contact customer service. Consider me an very dissatisfied customer."
3,Missed Out ....,"Thought-provoking, scary but yet ....You don't need to be an apologist for the financial industry to see this as a less than even-handed treatment of the credit issue. The glaring omission is any aspect of personal responsibility on the part of those who run up big credit card debt. Yes, there is predatory lending. But does anyone put a gun to the consumer's head and force them to borrow to or ""max out"" their credit cards?""Maxed Out"" feeds on the victim mentality so prevalent in arguing that THEY are responsible.Fast food companies are responsible for making us fat.Cigarette companies are responsible for us choosing to smoke.Everyone else is the villain and I'm just the victim.I'm not responsible.Sorry, I for one am not buying it.... Even on credit.For that reason, ""Maxed Out"" misses out."
5,A must see movie for every consumer!,"I've been teaching financial literacy and homeownership education for over 20 years now. Consumer finance has never been more complicated, and as this movie emphasizes, companies that extend credit are setting us up to fail. Their advertising would lead you to believe they care about their customers, but as another reviewer stated, they are in it only to make money--as much as possible--no matter the cost to the consumer. Although I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know, except perhaps the extent of the lobbying done by these companies, this film was very well done and made its point eloquently. The more information we have, the better able we are to make wise financial decisions--this movie is an important source of information and insight into an industry that pretends to be our friend--reminds me of the Spider and the Fly. Buy it, watch it, and pass it to others to watch."
5,Got to watch this DVD!,"I heard about this on the Dave Ramsey show. I picked it up for my wife and I to watch and was blown away on what the documentary showed. This is a powerful DVD, that is a must to watch if you have debt. I have now let people at my work borrow the DVD and they have had the same reaction."
3,"Interesting, but views consumers as victims...","This is a good documentary for providing the point of view from a consumer standpoint. However, it makes the spenders look like the credit card companies are evil, when in fact, the consumers were the over spenders. It's not a very entertaining documentary, but they do make some good points, and have good examples as to why staying out of debt is so important."
5,Seen it and love it,I saw this documentary on tv. I was appauld by the outright disregard for human lives. We are no longer people simply numbers in some coporate paycheck. This documentary proves and shows everything we have always feared. That we are in this by ourselves . our only defense is our power as consumers. You want to take down credit card companies? Want to make them care? Hit them where it hurts in their wallets. Dont apply for credit cards. Take the advice from the other reviews too. buy this dvd and pay cash. Its totally worth it.
5,Debt,"Debt, particularly credit card debt, is the modern version of sharecropping, which replaced slavery. The beauty of sharecropping, from the landowner's point of view, was that labor was much cheaper. Slaves had to be housed and fed; sharecroppers didn't. And with sharecropping, white people could be owned as well as black people.The best kind of slavery, again from the ""slaveholder's' point of view is invisible slavery. The ""slaves"" don't even know they are slaves, therefore they don't rebel.The slick marketers of debt, like predators in nature, prey on the most vulnerable; the young, the old, the unsophisticated, and the desperate. It is a conspiracy between the debt marketers, the government, and the colleges and universities. The American school system does not teach the dangers of debt, or how to avoid the trap.Buy ""Maxed Out"" in both forms: book and video. And share them."
3,"Worthy, but possibly skewed","I was compelled to view this documentary when I heard about it, and I'm glad I did. It is a jarring examination of the credit industry that I believe everyone (especially those who have ever used credit) should watch. Having experienced the negative aspects of credit industry practices, I feel like this movie's message is on target and desperately needed in our country.Even though I mostly agree with what this film has to say, its point is made mostly anecdotally. There are many experts interviewed on the one side I'll call ""anti-credit,"" but not enough on the other side to make this presentation balanced and fair. There is a clip of Jerry Falwell that appears to be apropos of nothing except perhaps political motivation.I would give Maxed Out four stars for emotional impact, but must detract a star for the one-sidedness."
5,Very very good indeed,"What an eye opener this book has been to me - and to think that all my life I have been hoodwinked and fooled by such a myth. Simply brilliant. I am so pleased to find out the truth. It was all a hoax, all a myth, all the time - and it has caused so much evil, so much war, so much blood shed. Thank you, Timothy and peter for writing such a brilliant expose on such a ridiculous religion. Those that still try to sell this outdated outmoded superstitious nonsense shouldbe made to write out ahundred times - I have been fooled! this must rank as one of the best truth books ever written. Thank you again for setting me free."
5,"Offense facemask, instead of like the one in the image, but I love it anyway!","Cool realistic helmet! It came packaged in a heavy duty circular clear plastic case that could be used as a display case if one wanted to do so. Like stated previously in the title, the helmet I received had the facemask of a player on offense, not like the one shown in the image, which is more for a player on the defensive side of the ball. I absolutely love mine!! I think it is of very good quality, and a fantastic value at around 20 bucks!"
2,Not for the extreme chewers!,Well I must say for the 3 hours my Pitbull had this toy he loved it-until he chewed it in half.This toy is not very durable-the ends (thicker areas) seemed to hold up ok but the middle was chewed through in no time. This might be an ok toy to fetch/play with but NOT recommended for the serious chewers out there.
3,"Nice, but my dogs were able to chew into pieces within a few days",I have 2 German Shepherds and they are big chewers. My oldest (4) was able to get the ends off within 48 hours of receiving the product. I will say that I liked that it took him that long. Usually its within a couple of hours. My dogs loved them. Wish I could find something that they wouldn't be able to chew apart.
2,Fun toy for 20 minutes,"My ""chomper"" is an 8 month old pit mix and destroyed this toy in under 20 minutes. She loved it when I first gave it to her, but it didn't last long. Good thing it has the warranty though."
2,Would be good if my dog liked it,"It's an interesting concept and a well-designed, durable toy, but my dog is simply uninterested. He is generally unpicky when it comes to toys, but this one just sits there, unused and unloved."
1,Destroyed in 1 minute,Our pit bull is a very powerful chewer. I was hopeful about this item after reading all the reviews. Within 1 minute he had one side of the item completely ripped off. I know there is a warranty but it wasn't worth it if he was just going to destroy the next one. The search continues.
4,very rugged,"my dog eats and destroys everything. this toy actually survives him.he is not infatuated with it and gets bored after a few minutes, but it lasts through his aggressive chewing habits, which none of his others toys can."
4,Another Great Hurley Toy,"Another great Hurley Toy--although I really like the Bumi ""boomerang"" a bit better. This is made out of either the same or similar recycled material(s). This bone is a bit on the heavy side, however, if you happen to have a smaller dog. Great for a lab or similar sized dog."
1,Not a durable toy,I purchased this toy because it claimed to durable. I gave it to my dog and it lasted all of about 15 minutes.
4,2nd one holds up to the beast,The last one held up for about two months which is two months longer than any other dog toy my Boxer has had. On my second one now. Hoping to get at least two months out of this one as well.
3,"Durable, but my dog doesn't 'dig' it","My doberman/pointer mix loves to chew and shreds many toys - in fact it is her goal to destroy toys in the most efficient way possible. She likes most nylabones (esp. the wishbone)but I thought she might like this because it's softer. It's quite durable and attractive (to me), but my dog just doesn't have much interest in it. She prefers the nylabones or blankets she can chew the binding off of. We've had it around for a few months now, and despite trying to get her to play with it, she mostly just sits on it."
4,One of his favorite!,"The first one we had lasted a really long time, (3-4 weeks) the second one (which they replaced free of charge) seemed to last half the time. Not sure if they are changing/working on the formula but this is a great toy and worth a shot for heavy chewers. Milo simply loved this toy!"
4,durable!,"we bought this for our large pup who is constantly chewing, and she has not chewed through this one yet! She even chewed through her kong, much to our dismay, but this one is completely in tact. That being said, it doesn't get alot of play because she knows she can't take it apart, but we're glad to have a few toys that last."
5,Great product,"60Lb lab/ hound mix 2 yrs old, kills kongs, kills anything with a squeek. This is still alive weeks later. Great product."
5,So far so good,I bought one of these and a Tux to see if a) my boys would like them and b) they'd hold up to my furry weapons of mass destruction. The answer to both is yes. They really seem to like both toys although they have a definite preference for this one (they're wrestling over it behind me as I type) and not a tooth mark on either one so far after a few weeks of heavy play. I've had to toss out a ridiculous number of toys in the last year because of damage (Kong toys included) so to find something that holds up ... that they actually like playing with ... yay!
5,Fetch,"Can't say enough good things about ZogoFlex and their toys. My dog loves them and has the hardest time destroying them. My dog has lost them long before destroying them. This toy is great in the water, it'll sink slightly when first thrown into the water, but it does float. Also great for tug o war as well. Its not as durable as the ball from ZogoFlex but its right up there."
4,Perfect For Strong Chewers!,My 1 year old bulldog mix loves to chew up anything he can get his paws on- he's even chewed up a Kong. This is one of the few products to last more than 5-10 minutes. It's still intact a week later and only has one small puncture that has not gotten any worse. We have 2 of these toys now and they are worth every penny. An added bonus is that they will replace the toy once if destroyed. Only 4 stars because he is not interested in this toy on a daily basis. I would love to see more Zogoflex toys produced. I would definitely recommend this line for strong chewers.
2,Nope,It was great for about a week until my 8 month Lab got a little piece off... the rest is history. So far only black kong and Planet Dog Orbee Tuff can survive. Poor Hurley is on his way back. :(
3,Not strong enough for a pitbull,"I read all the other reviews and saw the boxer loving the toy and had high hopes. I put this toy into the tux toy with treats and within 15 minutes our 2 yr old female pit mix had created a gash in the heart of the toy that will likely split by tomorrow. I love that the toy is made of recycled plastic and when coupled with the Tux it creates a great deal of excitement for our girl, but it just was not strong enough for her."
1,My dog chewed it apart in about two days,"I was foolishly looking for an industructible dog toy. My dog has gone through everything in a half hour at the most. So I try anything online that purports to be tougher than most toys. This was no different, although I must stay it took my lab about two days to tear an end off. Unfortunately my lab tends to eat what it breaks off. I have to watch all the time when I give her something. Anyway, this did last longer than most, including Kong balls, but outcome was the same; didn't last for any length of time as other reviewers had stated. So disappointing once again."
1,It didn't last,My Dog basically ripped it into three pieces in just a few minutes. But then my dog ate a Kong. So I am not sure if there really is a product out there that he cannot destroy. But no problem with shipping or service. Just the product did not last.
5,Sturdy,"My pup destroys most all her toys, all 10 pounds of her! She likes this bone, and has not made a dent in it."
4,so far not bad,"my little destroyer has not been able to take off any chunks of the rubber as she has been able to with every other toy, that being said though, she does not chew on it for extended periods of time, it is not a very fun or appealing toy."
1,waste of money,"If you have a 125lb french mastiff who aggressively chews or any aggresive chewer dont' buy this, my Buddy had it for 10 minutes and tore it up.........stick with the nylabone, they are the best he has many of them......"
1,"Well, it did last an hour.","My 8 month old 60lb lab mix destroyed this toy in an hour. Honestly, I never expected it. It seems that the largest Kong toy is the only thing he can't destroy. They advertise this toy as indestructible, but that just isn't the case here. Maybe some other dog can't break thru it or break pieces off it, but mine can and did.There's also a 1 time replacement if you take them up on their warranty replacement offer, but I'd have to spend $6 to ship it back only to get another one that my dog will destroy. That seems like a waste of time."
2,Not so indestructible,"I have a chocolate lab who has torn up every toy you can imagine. I don't know why I thought this would be any different! At least it didn't cost as much as the others I have purchased in the past for him. It lasted for about a week so I thought it was going to be a good buy because the others never make it past day 1. But after the first week, I started finding little blue chunks all over the house. Soon by the end of week 2, it was widdled down to about a 3 inch long piece and I had to throw it away. I still have yet to find a truly ""indestructible"" toy for my dog."
2,not very tough,"Got this for my doberman, he chewed on it for a day and had it ripped in half! The great thing is this company will replace the toy 1 time, at no cost. I am hoping i just got a bad one the 1st go around. My dogs other hurley toy is the best!"
1,Not for heavy chewers as listed,"I was really hoping this would stand up to what it says it would do. I have a 2yr old black lab, he is the sweetest fellow but he can chew up a storm. I thought this would be the answer. He had a chunk out of the end in just 5 minutes. Do not get this product if you have an agressive chewer it is just money lost."
3,Durable but not apealing to the dog,I was searching for an indestructable toy because my puppy can shred virtually any toy in a matter of minutes. This toy seems to be made well but the dog is not interested in it. If I put peanut butter on it he will lick it off but that doesn't take very long then he's done with it and leaves it alone. Would be better if it had a hole in it for a treat.
1,Destroyed in 35 minutes,"Tossed my 7-year old pitty the ""indestructible"" ""awesome for pitbulls"" ""made-to-last"" bone, in 35 minutes it was bitten in half. Either my dog has super-doggie powers no other pitbull possesses, OR this is a piece of crap that is marketing-hyped to make more sales than it deserves. Hmmm I wonder which it is.Do not buy this expecting a pitbull not to gnaw right through it. It will. Yet another over-priced over-hyped piece of rubber."
1,Boo! :(,My dog had pieces torn off of this within 10 minutes. I was so sad....this is not indestructible like they claim.
3,Nice dog toy,"My German Shepherd has her favorites, but they don't last too long. I'm hoping this will become her favorite, but it's taking awhile. The best toys for her are the ones that roll, bounce, or fly!"
5,Great Toy!,"This toy is great! Definatly tough and long lasting! Taisha (my 10 month redbone coonhound, who is 60 lbs) has a very strong jaw and she has constantly played with this toy for about 6 months now. Besides it looking a bit dirty, it still looks the same as when I bought it. I am very pleased with how well this toy has survived during her play time. My sister-in-law has Taisha's sister and she also purchased this toy and it is lasting at her house too! highly recommed this toy for anyone who has a hard time finding a toy that their dog can't destroy."
5,Great product for heavy chewers,"I have a 100 lb. yellow lab. He loves to chew and I could never find anything that would last--until now. The Hurley chew toy is virtually indestructable! They last through daily chewing for about 6-8 months. Unlike rawhide chews (his favorite) there is no risk to their stomachs from digesting the rawhide. Love it and always recommend it to my other ""dog friends""!!"
3,Not enough Art,"See the Space Monkey on the cover? Ok, now you don't need to buy the book. I like the monkey - but didn't need to see 20 permutations bound in a hard cover. Disappointing."
3,He's got me until the end,"The first three-fourths of this book are a fascinating cultural history of a style of music I love but know little about, and I found it all extremely enlightening. The last quarter of the book I frankly found a little self-serving, as it basically details Sapoznik's own career. Frankly, I kinda felt he was bragging a bit."
4,Well written for the everyday reader,"As someone familiar with the concept of game theory especially the prisoner's dilemma, I found this book to be particularly informative, on a layman's level. The history/biography of Von Neumann was interesting, and the applications of theory were appropriate. If you are looking for a purely scientific read, this is not for you, but if you are looking to be able to talk about a prisoner's dilemma and have some more cultural literacy, this is a good read."
5,Very interesting story about a remarkable man,"I just finished reading this book last night. It was a very enjoyable read, and did a wonderful job describing John Von Neumann's life and his brainchild game theory. It also does a decent job talking about how they both were related to the Cold War. An interesting fact I learned was that there were advocatesin 1950 for preventive war against the Soviet Union.While I enjoyed the story of Von Neumann's life (it is amazing how many great mathematicians were produced by Hungary in the 20th century), it is the discussion of game theory that truly grabbed me in this book. It has prompted me to look into the subject further.I highly recommend this book."
5,A primer on game theory and how it was developed,"A simple introduction to game theory through the lives of the people that developed it. A very interesting biography of Von Neuman, his views on politics and his influence in Cold War strategies"
3,non-technical intro to game theory,"Fairly readable book with a lot of background information. Not exactly what I expected. It outlines all sort of games and their histories but focusing more on the histories. Also talks about how the game situation shows up in different places. If you are interested in trivia around J. von Neumann and others, this book is for you. If you want to get an idea of what game theory is about without ANY math, this might be okay. But not the book to learn anything substantial about game theory. I guess thats the purpose, its just not my expectation."
4,Layman's intro to Game Theory,"I enjoyed this book and learned a lot. The author weaves the fundamentals of game theory through significant historical events. I particluarly like the examples and discussions the author presents to put the theories and dilemmas into realistic, social contexts.Two drawbacks: the lack of a technical theorem guide or appendix; and, the way the book lacks something that ties it all together. It loses momentum when Von Neumann's story ends. The last quarter of the book is abrupt as it runs through a group of definitions that fit under the game theory umbrella.Overall, it's a good enough balance of storytelling, logic and game theory fundamentals to recommend it to anyone interested in social theories, and the how game theory relates to political and economic policies."
3,Not his best,"I liked Poundstone'sLabyrinths of Reason: Paradox, Puzzles, and the Frailty of Knowledgemuch more than this book. I don't think Poundstone really knows how to write history or biography. He tends to pile up quotations (too often from popular newspaper and magazine articles) rather than offer any deeper sense of Von Neumann and his time. I was not entirely pleased with his presentation of game theory - it would have been much clearer had he made use of the notion of a ""dominant"" strategy. Some of his explanations are confusing. People interested in getting a quick understanding of what game theory is about might be better served by chapter six of Martin Hollis'sThe Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction (Cambridge Introductions to Philosophy)."
3,poorly organized,"Granted the subject matter is absolutely fascinating, 5 stars out of 5. Having said that, the subject deserves a much better treatment. This book was poorly organized and felt rushed. Yes, it was readable. But it felt like Poundstone just jammed together the results of his research rather than using his research to flesh out a coherent structure.The purported central point of the book was the influence of game theory on cold war strategy. Yet this theme was not well developed or documented. The book was part (weak) bio of von neuman, part (weak) introduction to game theory, and part(weak) history of the cold war. The parts just did not fit together smoothly."
3,not much of a primer.,"Although I enjoyed the book it was, I'm afraid, not much of a primer on game theory. The background and biographical information on Von Neumann was well told but lacked adequate information on his involvement politically. This book is more of a introduction to the IDEA of game theory and falls short of explaining the reality of game theory. Not informative enough, but still entertaining."
3,Add It To Your Bukem Collection,"While of course it's all a matter of opinion, I have to respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer. This album in no way sounds like GLO/Bukem's classic material, but that's what I liked about it. It definitely has a different energy. This album isn't a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but if you're a Bukem fan it belongs in your collection. For the price you can't lose."
2,a grade of C,"The artwork on the cover and on the actual disc is very generic. It's made to look like a blank CD that a civilian recorded stuff on. This is not LTJ's best work. It doesn't come close to ""Logical Progression"" in any way, shape, or form. Disc 1 was worse and droned on. Disc 2 was shorter in length, but musically, of much better quality. I'm not a DnB snob, so much stuff gets my approval. This was just okay. It doesn't stink, but there's better stuff out there."
1,Do not waste money on this book.,"The author is something of an anti-sex fanatic. The entire book is nothing but him saying sexuality is the ""devils work"" and then throwing out a bunch of bible verses to try and support his preconcieved notion."
1,Logical Fallacies and Irrelevant References Abound,"This book contends that sex is the center of moral crisis in America and that the trends we have currently adopted (tolerance of homosexuality, permissive pre-marital sexual relations, pursuit of sex for pleasure, etc.) will inevitably lead to a social collapse. Heimbach's arguments are based almost entirely on unsupported speculation. His social theories are flawed and inadequate. His references are frequently taken out of their proper context and misinterpreted. To make matters worse, Heimbach attempts to use these references to denounce paganism and encourage society's return to the same intolerant, cynical society it was in the early 1900s. This is a poor effort to support an unworthy cause. Sadly, it is likely that many irrational Christians have taken this book to heart and will thoughtlessly follow its teachings. For those who think critically, however, this book will be of no interest."
5,#1 Aaliyah fan 4 eva,"One of the most beautiffuly assembled calender, as tribute to a beautiful young woman,although there are some pictures of her that appeared in the previous 2003 calender,but other than that it's a must for any Aaliyah fan!"
1,WRONG CHORDS!!!,"It has a nice look to it, but MANY of the chords are wrong. There are other guitar chord books out there. DON'T waste your money on this one!"
3,What Happened?!,"Wait a second! Before all you people who love this cd decide to dismiss my review as trash, wait and hear me out. I found this review very hard to write because I myself am a huge Extol fan. I own all their cds and have enjoyed each on its own. For some reason though it is too hard for me to get into this cd becuase of their huge change musically. Also while I do really like the strong Christian lyrics on here, I didn't find the songs very captivating to listen to like on their older albums. Granted this cd is still better than lots of others out there. It will also be interesting to see how their next cd turns out considering they lost a couple members of the band. Anyway when the day comes for a new release I hope they remeber their roots and return back to that sound that made them so fantastic at what they do, which is to make outstanding music that rises above the rest."
4,awsome album,this album is so awsome. i loved it from the first time i listened to it. im pretty sure extol fans will love this album and if u are a fan of hardcore u will love this album. it is melodic as well as rough at some points.
5,Classic,"While they stumbled a bit with Undecieved, Synergy is a solid album on par with the immortal classic, Burial. The entire cd is tight. Sure, the vocals have changed, but once you get used to them they aren't that bad. The cover are is freaking awesome, too. If you buy one metal album this year, make this the one."
4,Get used to the Vocals and you have 1st Rate Extol,"Musically, this is the tightest Extol has ever been... The record goes for a thrash sound which is fine with the exception of the vocals... The singer goes for more of a weak shout than an all out growl as in Undecieved. This distressed me greatly at first but after a few listens you get used to it. Not as good as Undecieved but still a great album."
2,New Sound! Wait.. I've heard this before...,"Extol started off as some decent Black Metal that just needed a bit of polish. Rockin stuff I can occasionally get into. But with this release, they've fallen into the recent trend of Screamo. Which really blows. All I hear is Thrice with worse drumming. The Used but faster. Overall, incredibly lame. I'm pretty sure this'll play on American Radio, but honestly, this is one to pass up."
3,???,"Okay I'm Christian so I can say this without sounding prejudice - I have not heard one Christian band to date who can produce anything other than pointless hardcore or overdone black/death metal. It seems they're just out to show up the satanic crowd. Face it, only morons take the satan suckers seriously, so you don't need to show them up!Anyway, Extol is a pretty good band, and I didn't mind their previous efforts, but this one seems to be a regression. The songs are shorter, which is okay because they have no melodic elements to them and get old really fast. Extol's vocalist is really poor, and while I can't deny their guitar talent, I can say they might want to touch up the drumming just a bit. Their lyrics are just too praiseful; if they want to appeal to a wider audience, then they need to stop evangelizing. Furthermore, there's nothing creative about their song structures. Anyway, I'll be sticking to the secular stuff, but these guys have something to offer."
5,childs request from Santa,A young 3 year old child requested a fork lift for Christmas. He sees them everyday on the highway reconstruction project near his home. He loves this toy. I didn't think I could find one. He plays rough and he hasn't broken it yet. Although the engine door had to be removed because he kept lifting it too high and bending it.
5,Great Toy!,"Purchased this toy for our 6 year old grandson. What a great toy and he spends hours playing with it. Good size, easy to operate and very durable!"
2,disappointed,"well I expected to burn calories, the reason I bought it. I use a smaller t.v. and found it difficult to see the gear I was supposed to be in until I figured out to watch the little monitor move........but my bike computer put this at just over 200 calories, not over 1200, and I realized that this was for beginners or not as advanced, my opinion only. so I'll try different dvd's. And yes, 2 hours in the saddle is painful."
2,Not Good!,"I did not Like this DVD at all.... It has great music however, everything else is really boring....! you wont be motivated at all....!"
2,Defective and overall not worth the money,"The DVD was defective so almost half way through my workout I had to stop and start the DVD all over again. The music is decent so I gave this two stars. However, the view is not great at all. This was definitely not recorded by a professional so what should have been scenic views were mainly patches of dark gray/black views with bright colors coming from the cyclists gear. Don't waste your money."
2,Picture too grainy,"The reviews on this were great so I was excited to try my first indoor cycling video. The biggest problem with this video is that the resolution is awful. They really need to do high definition versions of this stuff. The picture quality of this when shown on my 60 inch tv was just terrible, even from across the room it was fuzzy. Second, the whole thing is on a cloudy day. How depressing, the only reason I ride inside is because the weather is bad and I have to be indoors. I sure don't want to watch an ugly day on tv, would much rather see a beautiful day at the beach or something.The commentary and shifting was good, gave me something to do. Although they shift waaaaay too fast and often to keep up...you'd think it was a video game controller they were using and alternating between the A and B buttons."
5,Great training video,"This is my first of Paul's videos. It got me hooked. This ride is probably one of the earlier in the series based on production standards, i.e. the brake cable in the camera shot. However, that doesn't change the quality of the workout. It's harder than it looks at first, and I still struggle to keep up with the metrics on the dashboard.Great scenerykeeps your interest. This is a great way to get a full ride in without leaving home."
1,TERRIBLE maybe Dangerous,"This seat is not sturdy it wobbles from side to side, it does not fit securley against the seats. Further, the back of it also does not tighten securley against a chair. My son who is a relativly quiet and still baby, was falling off the adult chair while positioned in this booster. It is just awful. I bought it and hated it so much that i had to get rid of it. Save your money and buy a plastic one. This travel size is not made well at all."
1,I don't like it at all,"I bought this as I thought it would be handy and portable to have around with my granddaughter and other visitors with little ones, but absolutely do not like it. It is easy enough to use, but way too floppy on the sides for little ones. I tried it on my 6 month great nephew who is used to sitting in a hard booster seat, and he was all over the place in this one. He wasn't close to falling out, I just didn't feel like he was in a good stable feeding position. For the money, there are other, better traveling boosters."
1,Not safe,"Had the Eddie Bauer seat for kiddo #1 but broke the buckles in the car door one night, no fault of that seat. Bought this seat for kiddo #2 and have to say that we've tried it at two different restaurants and it slides a lot and last night the LO nearly fell on the floor with just small baby moves. Scary."
3,Anti-psychiatry's New Manifesto,"I begrudgingly award this book 3 stars for readability; to deduct from its rating further for its painful bias (or its lack of copy-editing) would only bring into question the veracity of my review. However, I do so wish that this piece of propaganda had come with some sort of content warning. It's unfortunate that the narrator received what she perceived to be unnecessary medical treatment, but the fact remains that ECT and psychopharmaceuticals *are* medical treatment. They are, for some, the only way to stem the crippling symptoms of brain diseases. Discrediting psychiatry as a whole is a disservice to them.Being institutionalized is not fun, but there are many tomes that detail the ""awful truth"" of life on the wrong side of social services without casting aspersions on the entire field. Try ""The Last Time I Wore a Dress,"" for starters."
1,rip off,"this is the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased, i cant believe it, please dont waste your time or money on this, it b roke the second day, rubber bands poped man what a piece of junk i rate it a fat zero but i only had an option to give it a one,"
1,Waste of money,"the very day i received the armor abs 2, i used it, and all the bands came loose that same day. i see why it is so much cheaper than the 6 second abs"
2,"Works great, for the first day or two.....","I bought the armor abs because my gym membership just ended at my college. So I wanted to get a few small workout machines for home. The day i got it, one of the rubber bands popped of its holder already. The machine is designed very poorly, although what can you expect for the price. I've had to reattach the bands at least 15 times over the past week, and today one of the rubber band holders snapped in half, leaveing that resistance level useless :-( . Overall though, i have to say, i really love this thing. If it wasnt for the d*mn bands flyin off all the time, it would be a great peice of equipment. If you use it carefully and correctly, you may be able to avoid these problems though. I give it a two because i love the machine, but i hate its bad habits...."
1,Junk,"This is the worst piece of junk I have purchased. I should have looked at the reviews first. I put it together and it broke right away. I tried to fix it and it worked for three usese. After the thirs use, the bands snaped and I had to throw it away. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!!!!"
4,astounding insight from a child,"I was there when this young man wrote some of his first poems, as we first met when I was sixteen and he was fourteen. He is a truly beatiful person with a delicate soul and it shows through his words. Seizures of the Sun reflects the purity of his personality and the fragilty of his heart. His poems put wordsmiths three times his age to shame; Meschach's insight is unparalelled. He has the ability to craft words like clay--his poems work magic. It is truly a shame that he stopped writing--the only greater shame is that I can no longer speak with him."
5,Floricienta es lo mejor de latinoamerica,"I WILL SPEAK SPANISH, SORRY AMERICA AND EUROPE...Floricienta es una de las series mas divertidas que hay en latinoamerica, a quien no le guste Floricienta, es un ridiculo de malos gustos, aunque se ve de niños y puras cosas infantiles. Te llega al corazon con un flechazo. Recomiendo todos los CD's de Floricienta. Te hara bailar y reflexionar todo lo que hay en este mundo maravilloso de esta serie."
3,Bounty Hunter Carry Bag,"Like many other reviews, the Bounty Hunter Carry Bag lacks pretty much padding, period. It is nicely constructed with good material and has an inner silky-like liner with maybe a thin sheet of something sandwiched in between the two. But basically it's like a thin one layer canvas bag for the most part.With my Quick Draw II broke down it fits ok, but with a tight fit on putting the front shaft into the bag.The bag has a bag length adjustable shoulder strap, two smaller handheld straps, dual closing bag length zippers and a 8.5"" x 8.5"" zippered storage area on one outside end and Velcro straps inside. But when I strap the detector down then the head control unit has to lay on the bottom of the bag for the straps to hold it.Bag does have quite a bit of room but everything will just bang together as there is no partitions or padding inside.Buy some bubble wrap I guess and wrap everything up, then strap it down and then it's a great bag."
2,Total Rip Off -,You have to take the Metal Detector apart to put it in the bag. Considering the price - Total Rip Off.
1,I wouldn't buy another one.,"I saw a review where the guy said he could put two detectors and all his equipment in the bag. I can't. It's a cramped fit to put one Sharp Shooter two in it, and that's after you take it apart and put the two pieces in the bag. There is enough room for 8"" and 4"" coils and headphones, but you have to take everything out of the bag to get to them. The bag is cramped with the detector alone and offers no padding for protection. If it sold in the $5 to $10 range, I would have given it two stars."
2,Questionable Value,"I bought the metal detector because I needed to find a lost survey pin. I assumed I'd need something to keep it in so I ordered the carry bag. It is reasonably well made but it is just a nylon zippered bag. There is nothing particularly unique about it (other than the name emblazoned on the side) and it does not afford the metal detector much protection. The metal detector arrived in a well designed box that would suffice for long term storage and probably offer more protection against accidental damage in transit. It would take more time to unpack and repack the box so I'd recommend the carrying bag to those buying a metal detector for frequent use. But for someone who, like me, who intends to use the device infrequently and needs a storage case, I'd recommend saving the twenty bucks. Just use the product packaging."
4,Nice carry bag,Bought this for my husband's new metal detector and he really likes how sturdy and roomy it is. He can pack all his 'extras' inside and the carry-handles make it convenient to pack around.
4,Padded,"This is an ok carrying bag. The only diffrence with this and the standard is the extra padding. It is not larger or have more pockets. It is just more padding. However, its nice and does the job by what I can tell. I would spend the extra buck or two for the extra padding in this one compared to the standard. Actually, they both are over-priced. You can get the same thing at &*%-mart. But if you insist on a Bounty Hunter Bag, go with this one. The padding is worth it....I guess."
5,Great bag,Perfect bag for your Bounty Hunter Metal Dectector. I was able to add another coil and a book and digging tools with no problem.
3,Too Short,"The bag is of good quality, but is so short that I struggle to insert my bounty hunter landranger detectot with it broken down to it's most compact size. It is so much trouble to use that I've decided to purchase another longer bag."
2,Smaller than expected,I'm disappointed that the metal detector has to be taken apart to fit in the bag. Other than that it was great quality and nicely padded.
3,this was a good sequel to DAUGHTER OF PROPHECY,"in this book Bush introducesto us the children born at the end of DAUGHTER OF PROPHECY as adults. it follows Roderic, the son of Phineas and Mellisande, who is now the prince of Meriga, as he is thrust into the spotlight when he is called upon to sit in as king when Abelard is kidnapped by his son Amanander. it also follows Roderic's discovery and relationship with Annandale, the daughter of Abelard and Nydia, who is also a magical empath. like DAUGHTER OF PROPHECY, bush concentrates a little too much on the physical aspect of their relationship rather than the intricate plot that was created, but never resolved. but it's a solid book. the only thing i did not like was that unlike DAUGHTER OR PROPHECY, which could have stood on it's own, CHILDREN OF ENCHANTMENT has an open ending, baiting us for the final book in the trilogy."
1,swisher postmaster,"Disappointed in performance, is under powered for most tasks. The machine is difficult to pull behind ATV and get close enough to fence to do and adequate job and then is easily bogged down by grass. The recoil action increases the difficulty in doing a nice job of mowing.The postmaster does have limited application along ditches but again you must move very slowly to allow machine to keep running this can be extremely difficult even in the lowest gear on an ATV. I have owned the postmaster for two years but after initial trial period rarely use the machine. Very disappointed."
3,Pretty good for what it is.,"The lens attaches like a lens cap and isn't good for big, jolty movements. It's not really secure, but I wouldn't call it flimsy either. If your camcorder doesn't have lensthreads though, this is the only thing I see out there that will workFor the Camcorder that I have, I noticed a few things:1. I'm not sure why the buttons on the sides have to extend out so far. It gets in the way of the flipscreen.2. I have giant vignetting around the edges. but it works!3. My camcorder has a auto 'macro' mode. but the lens wouldn't focus that way. I have to manually turn on macro and then the lens works great.Overall, I'm not sure whether to return it, or whether to get the .5x converter as well (or instead)"
1,The QC series are not compatible with HD cameras.,I bought this lenses but had to return it back. My HD camcorder refused to focus with this lenses on.All that I could obtain was a blurry image. I was informed later by manufactrure's Customer Support the QC series are not compatible with HD cameras.
2,Disappointment,"The chapter by Dr. Richard Spaide is excellent. Other chapters by other authors don't even seem to have been thoroughly proofread. Given the relatively low price, I suppose it's reasonable."
2,"Sloppy, undisciplined, cloying and--- brilliant!","After years of agonizing near misses, the common man's poet, William Logan, finally discharges the poetic equivalent of ""Springtime for Hitler."" Logan's verse has always been remarkable for the simple rhymes, predictable structures, sloppy word choice and desperate, cloying neediness. This time, somehow, Logan turns all of those hideous tendencies into a hilariously comic satire on academic verse with a collection of mulch-pile ditties so lifelessly bombastic that it screams ""I was born in an MFA workshop.""I laughed so hard as I read this book that I almost wet my pants. Logan has finally done something worthwhile with his life. Can the Broadway musical of ""Vain Empires"" be far behind?"
3,"Not comfortable, poor sound quality","I purchased this headset for use with my phone. No problems pairing the headset with couple of phones and my laptop. But the good things end there. The ear loop starts hurting my ear after 10-15 min and is not flexible to suit/adjust to your ear. Switching from one ear to another is a pain. Also, I heard several complaints of poor sound quality when talking to my friends.I would stay away from this product next time !"
5,Love them.,They were a very hot group back in the late 60's and early 70's. They made some great music and had a lot of hits.
5,Great For Toddler's,"This is such a great movie for little boys everywhere that loves animals and tractors. My little boy has watched it so many times in just the short time he has had it and every time he interacts with the movie. I am also so surprised at how much he has learned from this movie he has learned all about tractors, combines which to be honest I didn't know that is what they were called lol. So, I guess you could say I learned something too. It is really a cute movie and I am sure I will be getting more because they have a lot of John Deere movies just like this. I also feel that the movie is just the right amount of time, with little ones after a short time they get really squirmy so 35 minutes was perfect."
4,Great For the Tractor Enthusiast!,"My 2 year old went through a phase where he was obsessed with tractors and when I found this movie, I was thrilled! It is really cute, with catchy songs and is also very informative without boring the little ones. This is one movie that my son would sit down and watch for 20 minutes non-stop, but also loves to take out his own tractors and mimic what they are doing on the movie. I would hands down recommend this DVD!"
4,Buen Intento como Solista ! / Good Intent as Soloist!,"Me encanta hj aqui en colombia es el primer ssingle y esta sonando muy bien, cuando era parte de elefantes me encantaba ese grupo, pero no lo hace mal como solista, otra cancion muy buena es Al Fin Me Armé de Valor.I love Amor Del Bueno here in colombia it is the first single and this sounding very well, when it was part of elefantes I loved that group, but doesn't make it bad as soloist, another very good song it is Al Fin Me Armé de Valor.."
4,Average,"I consider this album as an average... Reyli did a big mistake by separating from his fellow band members.. ""ELEFANTE"".. now this album contains very few Elefante like songs not too good for Elefante Fans... he went in a very romantic direction and that's what this album contains... a lot of romantic taste and not that beautiful guitar sounds that distinguished Elefante from other bands... i like this album but i would've considered it better if it would've been with Elefante"
1,Horrendo asqueroso cursi y naco,esto es lo que me parece el cd de reyli y es un naco que se cree el muy chiapanieco deberia de retirarse y seguir planchando ajeno
4,"It stores pictures, I don't have another card to compare it to.","The Ultra 1, Ultra 2, eXXXXXtreme 3, eXXXXXXXXXXXTreme 4, eXXXtraSuPer619 card thing that Sandisk has is kind of confusing. Despite that, I took the advice of others and went with an Ultra II for it's low cost and OK speed. File transfer isn't instant but it doesn't really take that long. Considering the price of Sandisk's fastest cards, I'll wait an extra minute or two."
3,great pump for the price,"could be quieter, but powerful enough to drive 4 air stones in my under gravel setup as well as driving a 5 inch bubble disk."
5,An album of substance from an artist of immense talent,"I haven't heard anything this good in years, the themes touch on the essence of the human condition. I know what my music loving friends will be getting as gifts this year!"
4,Honest Love,"The book, Modern Love: 50 True and Extraordinary Tales of Desire, Deceit, and Devotion gives the reader, within a few minutes of reading, the chance to enter the completely honest mind of another person telling a ""love story."" Often insightful to the human condition and the quirks of happenstance that happen in the lives of real people. Like a secret history you'd only tell a friend, this book is full of them! Just imagine fifty unusually honest secrets you've never heard before all about modern life and love."
5,VERY IMPORTANT ARTICLE ON FUTURE OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT,"In this article, Prof. Fisher creates a framework to point out the benefits of supply chain flexibility. Though the notion of flexibility is an old one, Fisher adds in substantial anecdotal stories on how exactly it could be done.In the most important example in this paper, the authors focus on Sport Obermeyer and how delaying orders until the company has a glimpse of demand (a trade show) can help improve forecasting and thereby the profitability of the entire supply chain.Though the example is focused on Obermeyer, there is enough information in this article to help a reader find for himself ideas on how to improve their own supply chain's flexibility and the benefits of implementing such solutions. This is definitely a very good, easy to read article that can help any supply chain manager convince others of the benefits of flexibility."
4,"Great UPS, as long as you add-in the SNMP management card","This is a great stable rackmount battery backup with dual-conversion so devices plugged in always get clean power even with a dirty utility.I never did get the built-in USB or serial management interface to work with any open source monitoring tool, so I had to spring for the add-in SNMP card in order to monitor/manage the UPS. With the add-in card, NetAgent web and SNMP work great.I've had the system up and running for 150 days, including several brief power outages, and haven't even had to think about the system, it just works."
3,Buy the originals,"While containing a couple of new songs...All the re-recordings of their past hits are a little on the self-indulgent side. I love Agent Orange's old albums. Upon reciept of this, I was disipointed that the once great songwriting and musicianship had fallen into a pattern of living in the glory of the past. Save your hard earned money, and buy the originals."
4,Good and balanced,"Great matched pair. Brighter than expected, so I eq-ed the individual poles for a slightly higher bass response. Using the tone knob also helps. This can do everything from clean jazz, to overdriven blues to hard rock and metal. Much warmer than ceramic magnets, so that might make metal guitarists soft in the pants. Dropped in and installed easily into triple shots on an epiphone les paul ultra for maximum flexibility."
5,Relly catchy lyrics with wonderfull music,the first time i heared the single Shakespeare in Love i liked it at once. it has all i want in music rythem lyrics music.
2,Not the best read,I would just take some time and google the subject as oposed to reading this collection of idea with little factual information backing it up.
4,Decent guide,This book is a decent guide for writing in this genre. There is enough practical knowledge to give a jumpstart on writing in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy realm. It is a good read.
3,THE WAY WE WERE,Probably one of the greatest love stories (on film) Streisands' haunting theme melody makes it a good buy.
2,More expensive than print...but less info,"The Kindle edition is much more expensive than the print edition....and does not have the charts, pictures etc. Hope TIME is rethinking soon."
4,Interesting Magazine,I have perscribe to time eight years and starting this year I have an Amazon Kindle and believe I will for now on as long as I have an E reader I will be reading Time Magazine because I love them for the pictures they use on the cover is very explainatory on the issue that is important at the time we live in. And all the other issues that are in the magazine are important and interesting events happenning around the world that most people I think people would want to know about happennig at the time. I sincerly recomend this for people who want to keep up with what is going on in the world in the time of today.
1,No Kindle Fire Version,What a disappointment. Crap version for the older Kindles and no version for the Kindle Fire. I refuse to go out an buy a hard copy of this magazine if they don't respect its readers.
3,Pros and cons,"The good thing about suscribing for Times on Kindle is being able to keep it digitally forever (as long as you keep your Kindle) while having a magazine in print may lead to tearing and etc. Also, there isn't any annoying ads to flip over. The not-so-good part is that the pictures aren't as great as the ones in print."
2,Time and time again,"I have purchased the magazine for years and love it. when i recieved notification from time it would be free on my reader, I was even more owerwhelmed but lo and behold there is no way to do this on my kindle. i am amble to get it ob my ihone but not willing to pat again for the Kindle."
4,Great way to keep informed,This is a great way to keep informed of current events. At less than $1.50 a month it is much cheaper than a Kindle newspaper subscription. You can see the cover picture the moment you open your new magazine each week and there are pictures with some of the articles. It is much easier to read in this format with no advertisements and you can read each article start to finish. Your old issues are archived so that the newest edition is what you find under Time on your Kindle.
2,Terrible Format but Convenient,"Pretty much all has been said. The content, which is the most important aspect is the same as the print edition - I.e. enjoyable and interesting. But it's incomplete without the pictures and charts, and absolutely terrible formatting spoil the experience. That said, for $1.49 what do you expect? So, I've kept the print edition, but at this price I've also kept the Kindle edition for convenience. If Time wish to charge more, they'd better get their act together with the formatting though. Let's hope enough interest is generated in Kindle to make it worth their while."
5,Quite Good,"The formatting is a little off, but most of the content is there. Since there are no ads in the kindle version, it is even easier to read than the paper one. Defnitely worth the price."
1,Did not seem to have as much content as the hard copy.,I read the Kindle version of Time in very little time. It did not seem to have anything in it that I could not have read for free searching the internet. I have to question the wisdom of any form of weekly news magazine in the age of the internet.Not worth paying for news you can get for free on the Internet.
1,Only on e-ink Kindles?,"How is Time not available for the cloud reader or for the Kindle fire? This doesn't make any sense. Time Magazine: If you want people to pay you for your work, don't limit what screens they can view your content on."
2,No Access To Kindle Fire Android Edition,"As owner of regular Kindle and a new Kindle Fire, I've been waiting for the Fire to arrive before subscribing to Time. Now that I have it, I discover that Time's android app will only give access to print subscribers. You cannot subscribe to the digital Kindle Fire edition. Thekindle edition is only for the older B&W Kindles and not include all articles or illustrations, nor does it give you access to the android app."
2,Ad should be more forthright,"In the advertisement, we read ""The Kindle Edition of Time contains most articles found in the print edition, but will not include all images."" Either TIME has shrunk dramatically (possible) since I last subscribed, or you don't get ""most of the articles"". I found a lack of hard news and too much fluff. Images should be featured. Until the e-version becomes a lot more robust, I'm going to opt out."
2,Inferior electronic version costlier,"Here's the thing. Many reviewers have touched on the issues with the electronic version of Time magazine, the formatting issues, the problems with graphics, and so on. So tell me, why would I pay $36/year for this electronic version when I can have the dead-tree version delivered to my door with none of the problems of the electronic version for just $30/year? Do publishers really think we are that stupid? (Wait, with all the eBooks priced the same as or higher than their printed version, I guess I should already know the answer.)"
3,"The text version, sans graphics.","I am a moderately satisfied subscriber of this ""text-only"" edition of Time.The articles are there and with the recent SW update, navigation is literally a piece of cake.My only gripe is thus the total lack of descriptive graphics and graphs, complemented by completely illegible text-only tables. If the staff at Time would take its time and include a couple of pictures instead, I'd gladly upgrade my review to 5*"
1,Kindle is not ready for magazines,"No pictures (some present), awkward table of content. In all, very unpleasant to read in Kindle format."
2,Just not complete,I tried the 14 day sample and I enjoyed the articles as usual but without a the headings on the content page you have to page through the whole magazine or click next article. I also felt I missed something with no images being included in a few articles. The Kindle 2 has pretty nice images for black and white so why omit? I would give it another try if they fixed these areas.
5,"Everything a Time ""READER"" needs.","If you love your Time magazine and hate advertisements...this Kindle edition is for you. It has all the articles and no stupid advertisements. I see a lot of reviews about lack of photos...if your get a Time magazine for pictures, you are plainly missing the point of a Kindle. The Kindle is designed for ""READERS""...not for pre-schoolers who like colored pictures. For $1.50 for four issues a month...I give this five stars."
1,Amazon increases Time price,"I don't mind reading Time without pictures and I have enjoyed the articles, but Amazon just doubled the subscription price. Sure, since I am already a subscriber, I can get 6 more months at the $1.49 per month, but I am afraid that this is just the beginning. I understand that everything goes up in price, but I have only had a Kindle for 2 months and I didn't expect such large increases in book and magazine prices so soon. I guess I am too naive."
4,Simple and Quick,"They are not going to win any design awards for the implementation, but the content is simple and quick to read. I use it as a supplement to my printed subscription of the magazine. I commute via the subway, so for me it's really handy to have the articles available on my Kindle.The Good: Quick and simple to use.The Bad: Don't expect this version to replace your printed or online experience. Time's photos and graphs really enhance the stories... they currently are not a part of this version."
2,What have I been missing?,"Stupidly subscribing to this online magazine since January 2011. At a price 75% higher than the print edition, I might add. But it was convenient to find it on my Kindle every Friday and even though the formatting of some articles is pretty brutal, I just accepted it as something to be improved upon...eventually. However, after finding out that there was a special Bin Laden edition released dated May 20th 2011, I began to wonder ""what else have I been missing?"" Goodbye Time e-edition."
2,You CAN beat the price,"Bob, don't know where you learned the ""new math"", but at 2.99 a month the Kindle version is 69 cents an issue. I recently renewed my paper subscription and at $20 annually, that one is 38 cents an issue. And it has all the pictures and charts, etc. For my money, the Kindle version just isn't a good buy."
4,Kindle Time magazine is NOT the paper version,"I always appreciate the reviews from others that Amazon provides. I think that like most people we tend to look at the extremes in view when in fact, like most things, the quality of a given thing is usually somewhere in the middle. No, this Kindle edition is not the paper edition with colorful pictures, advertising and needless fluff. Another reviewer found fault with Time magazine in general and decided to voice those complaints against this Kindle edition. If you don't like Time magazine then by all means don't read it, but don't take it out on the Kindle edition when in fact you don't like Time magazine at all. It is what it is, and I think we all pretty much know what it is, a well established franchise like McDonalds or Burger King, it tastes the same everywhere; and if you are happy with a convenient, portable electronic edition of Time magazine which can be read on the go, then you'll be happy with this."
2,Almost complete lack of images is alarming,"When the cover story of the current issue (December 21, 2009) is ""The Year in Pictures - Extraordinary Images from 2009 in the Words of Those Who Took Them"" and there is NOT ONE accompanying image - yes, even in the US edition, downloaded in the US - it absolutely beggars belief as to what the point of the Kindle version is. (Each and every article even has a lead-in crediting ""Words and photograph by..."" each author, just to tease you.)"
1,terrible,not amazing. there is no insights like the actual magazine. no maps pictures or graphs makes it difficult to comprhend. no value of inginuity has been placed in this to make a worthy sybsciption to subscribe for.
2,"Too little, too late.",Osama got whacked on a Sunday and I couldn't wait for an in depth story the following Friday when the new issue downloads. Not a word about it.
1,Laughably irrelevant,"Time has had some ridiculous cover stories in the past, but really? There's no story more pressing than some whack-job parenting technique that encourages borderline incest?"
1,Should be names Obama instead of Time,"Enough Obama already. There are other topics in the world. No wonder you are going broke, the electronic version of your rag is even worse, much worse, than the regular magazine. I am so sorry that I spent one penny on this crap!"
2,kids and summer..,this year lots of kids are wasting their time in the pool.th e worst thing is that their is a virus in our state.i think you know that virus:the swine flu.
1,Good when it works,"I do like getting my Time magazine on the Kindle since it eliminates extra paper cluttering up my house. The articles lack a bit because of no pictures, but for the most part I find it an enjoyable way to read my magazine weekly. However, at the end of 2009, my issues stopped arrived even though they were paid for and Time Magazine's website shows two more issues have hit the stand. An e-mail to Amazon has gone unanswered. Not great service! From here on I think I'll stick to books."
2,Time and The Amazon kindle,No pictures/graphics in m my current Amazon Kindle.I am be moving to a Galaxy Tablet.Thank you very much
2,"Great writing, but...","I thought I could deal with the ""no photo"" aspect that Canadian users are faced with for Kindle magazines and newspapers. However, when the ""Year in Pictures"" issue was delivered sans photos it was too much to take and I had to cancel."
2,I don't believe the Kindle edition is a complete issue of Time,"It's been awhile since I picked up a paper copy of Time, but I find it difficult to believe that the issue I recently purchased in digital format here was a complete representation of the print edition. Forget about pictures (it does have a few) -- I'm talking about articles. I didn't compare with the paper version, but I would have expected more than 30 minutes of reading material."
2,No table of contents,"I'd like to read some parts of Time but not others, so I very much miss having a convenient table of contents. As it is, we have to (slowly) leaf thru all articles to find out what's of interest."
2,Democratic Rag,"There's nothing wrong with being a news magazine with an agenda to forward the Democratic Party as long as you 'fess up to it. What is wrong is purporting to report the news with no bias when nothing can be farthur from the truth.For an illustration in honesty in publishing, check out National Review. Readers may not agree but at least they understand what they are purchasing.Love Live Prada! Oops. I meant Time Magazine."
1,obamas magazine,if you are a democrat and support obama@you will love this magazine. i am not and do not so i will unsubscribe
1,Not enough format options!,"Admittedly, its my fault for not checking whether or not it came in iPad format, but the the button for drop down menu revealing the available formats wasn't immediately obvious either! You could argue that I should have checked more thoroughly, but when every other publication I've purchased for my Kindle has also been available for iPad I didn't think it was necessary! Naturally, I find this dissapointing! Nevermind. I will reconsider this purchase if and when this becomes available for iPad in the future."
2,Thin Is Not Always Beautiful,And this periodical is thin on content. A half dozen items and that's it. Now if I can just figure out how to cancel before the 14 days is up.
1,"Print Subcriber, App doesn't work, Time Inc/Kindle don't help","I am a print subscriber of Time and am supposed to get the Kindle App for free. However, it doesn't work for me. When I enter my log-in information, it says ""unknown error."" I have called up both Time Inc and Amazon and they keep saying it is the other's fault. Bottom Line - I pay good money for Time Magazine print edition and want to read it on my Kindle, yet due to incompetence, I can't. It's no wonder the newsweeklies are dying."
1,Why pay more for less?,"Time will sell you the paper magazine, mailed to your home, for $25/year. Here you have to pay $36/year AND you can only have it on select devices (none of which have color displays). ""No Sale,"" Time Magazine - get with the current age and 1) stop wasting paper, 2) give a discount for low-cost production and low-cost of delivery, and 3) open up to all Kindle devices."
1,Disappointing Omissions,"The straw that broke the camel's back for me was that the magazine cover highlighted 3 stories including one about Walter Cronkite. But the Kindle edition of the issue does not include the story. I can forgive (but not love) the lack of graphics, but when the cover stories aren't even included, then I wonder what I'm paying for."
1,Passable - but not good enough for a price hike,"Time has addressed some of the concerns previous reviewers have brought up - there are no more truncated articles, and there are occasionally a few pictures with the articles. The writing remains diverse and interesting. I find that the lack of charts, ads, and huge picture spreads allows me to better focus on the writing, and the messages the authors wish to convey.However, it still lacks a table of contents. I still feel that some articles are missing on occasion, although I don't have a print edition to compare it to.So, for a $1.49 a month magazine (just under the price of a print subscription), it's decent. But at $2.99? Nearing double the price of a print subscription, with all the color pictures and charts, and knowledge that you are, in fact, getting the whole text of every article published? Just not worth it."
1,Just the text,"As others have noted, Time version for Kindle is pretty bland and without the feel of a magazine. Like the Kindle for books and the Wall Street Journal. Can't get excited about it for this magazine."
1,Poor Value for Cost,"Time has always been an excellent magazine, but there is no excuse for charging more for an electronic version that doesn't require paper, ink, a printing press, or postage for delivery, especially when the pictures and graphics (many of which help explain the article) are so limited.The publisher's unwillingness to pass on their savings to the consumer, and at the same time offer a financial incentive to undertake a greener method of delivery, earns them poor marks in my humble opinion.Everybody wants to go green, but I see no reason to make us pay extra for it when the publishers aren't."
1,Time is a Dinosaur on the verge of extinction,Will cancel my free trial. Thought subscription price was reasonable but content and restrictions are ludicrous. Time is a dinosaur and will be extinct soon unless it evolves!To bad really
5,review of this issue of Time magazine.,I am partial to Time--this is an excellent article on Osama--filled with details--I am so happy to be able to read this--
1,DISAPPOINTED!!,"I'm really disappointed. As a current title holder and someone who has competed for national titles I don't think this book is really accurate. It is billed as a rodeo queen pictorial, but the pictures are so limited. It's about rodeo culture. Not rodeo queens.There are so many pictures of random rodeo scenes. In fact, I think it gives the layperson a really negative view of the rodeo culture. The pictures are over exposed and the way they are printed make them seem so dated. It's almost embarrasing. The few pictures that she had of queens weren't great, nothing to write home about. If they were of myself, I probably wouldn't buy the book.To me it was a disappointing waste of money. But if she got THIS published, I know I could put my personal photos together, not rake the time to title them and be a hit!"
1,Rodeo Girl...a book of pictures,"I was disappointed in this book. I have met and spent time with Miss Rodeo America 1999 and 2000, and the Miss Rodeo California's from 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 as well as held rodeo queen titles of my own.I purchased this book as a resource for rodeo and queen competitions. I expected a book about the life of a rodeo queen and some of the challenges and triumphs that are experienced by the first ladies of rodeo. This book is unfortunately of little to no use for current or potential rodeo queen competitors.Much to my surprise, this book is a compilation of untitled photos that depict candid images of rodeo queens, children, and cowboys in a variety of rodeo-ish settings. As a coffee table book, this would be great, if all I wanted was a book of pictures."
3,"Well written, but still something lacking","This is a book that I really wanted to like. The premise is interesting and the characters have real depth. I blasted through the book in two days, with most of the reading on the second day, so I have to admit that the book was captivating. I found the ending, however, unsatisfying. The final resolution between the main characters seemed forced and abrupt to me. In spite of my misgivings, I think this book is worth reading because it is well written and I think others would probably enjoy it more than I did, particularly if character driven stories are more to your liking."
5,My favorite book by Octavia,"This was the first book I ever read by Octavia Butler - I remember staying up to 6 in the morning to finish it. The story is fantastic and I love that unlike many other science fiction and fantasy authors, she remembers that there is more race in the world."
5,A breath of fresh air,"After reading Butler's book, I felt a rush of relief. Finally-something different! Butler's book is marvelous in its orginality. As an African American female, I couldn't help but feel overwhelemed. Though there are many fantasy stories where women are the main characters, there aren't many where they are black. It was as though black females just didn't have a place in fantasy, but after reading Butler's well-written novel, I was greatly thankful to the author. Also, the nature of Anyanwu and Doro is so original along with the complex relationship. Fantasy readers in general will love this because it's so different."
4,A Masterpiece,"This novel first came to my attention via a book by Orson Scott Card on how to write fiction. Mr. Card drew a handful of worthy examples of style from this book, and rightly so. Although the first chapter is by far the best on many levels, the rest of the story is fascinating and gripping. A work of speculative fiction, ""Wild Seed"" contains elements of history, anthropology, biology and geography combined with the genres of fantasy and science fiction. A century from now this book should be well enshrined as a classic of North American literature."
5,Humbled,"If you want to be humbled by writing talent, buy this book. Octavia Butler manages to be succinct and brilliant. She is a master at exposition--it's so subtle, so interwoven, that you barely realize its there.I loved the story and gobbled it all up in one sitting on an airplane. Truly impressed."
5,A good futuristic story,by Octavia Butler. I ordered this before I knew there were other story books attached to this story. I read it a second time when I received the 4-part novel.
5,Imaginative,"This was the most imaginative book I've read in a while. When I was explaining some parts to my sister, I really began to realize the depth of Ms. Butler's world. It was our world, but these character existed on a level that most people would never encounter. The main character Anyanwu is so strong and wise and yet a bit naive when it comes to Doro. Butler balances these two characters against each other so well that you can sense the chemistry between them as you read. I was very impressed with the story and the writing. I borrowed it from the library and when I finished, I went and bought myself a copy and recommend it to anyone who reads."
4,Great book until the end,"Ingenious book really well written and gripping, but the ending is disappointing."
5,Best Author Ever,"This was the first book by O. Butler I read. I still re-read it sometimes. The woman is brilliant and truly, honestly, unbelievably original. You won't find her ideas cropping up elsewhere. They are new and completely original to her. Extremely satisfying read; though my favorite is still the series Dawn; Adulthood Rites and Imago. Riveting. I'd live there in a heartbeat."
2,Ultimately a downer,"I disagree with the majority vote here. I found the writing and story line to be like a bad Anne Rice novel. At least with Rice's vampires, you get a sense of their passion. Butler's book lacks this passion. For this reason, I found the characters not very well developed. To me, Doro was flatly evil and Anyanwu was long-suffering. And the various powers the characters possess end up seeming X-men cartoonish.I do think Butler writes well, and loved the Lillith's Brood series. But this book disappointed me and didn't leave me any the better for having invested my time in reading it."
2,Story okay...Kindle formatting awful,"The story was pretty good. I enjoyed it. However, the formatting for the Kindle was awful. Words were mispelled, periods were missing at the ends of sentences, the number ""1"" was used for the letter ""L"" randomly, just to name a few of the many, many mistakes found on every page. If this had been a free book, perhaps I wouldn't complain. But I paid around $10 for this book. Amazon, what gives?"
5,Lovely somewhat steamy story,"This book what GREAT! The charactors were totally believable and I ACTUALLY was abale to stay focused! I have adult ADD and this is the 1st book I have read from cover to cover on my own free will. I normally get bored in anything I try to read, but I could not put this book down! After reading the book I checked out the author info and I was amazed to find that she teaches HS in my community. That alone was amazing! Buy the book! I cannot wait to read the next book in this series!"
5,Excellent!!,"I loved the book!I read it within a day,i could not make myself stop.Great plot,well developed characters,awesome writing.Perfect!"
5,A beautiful story of true love and forgiveness...,"This is a beautiful work of art... a story of a prostitute finding meaning in life through God's mercy and love... a man trusting his broken heart to love again... This is indeed an ""up-until-three-in-the-morning"" book... I couldn't put it down... If you love inspiring and romantic tales of God's love and mercy i encourage you to read this great piece of work..."
1,No one cares,"How fitting, I'm the first to review this record probably because I'm one of the only people, besides fellow band members, to have heard it.Right now, this record is fittingly collecting reams of dust in cut-out bins across America. I scream, you scream, we all scream for Impaled to just call it quits."
4,Good little realistic excavator! Great price for Bruder!,"This is one of the smaller, lesser priced Bruder vehicles. But a perfect size for a 3.5 year-old. Well made, German made. Easy to store unlike some of his Bruders. Perfect companion to the mini steam roller. Some of the parts are a little fragile, though. I would try this one out before you invest in a more expensive Bruder toy."
4,I like it.,"My son loves any type of equipment and loves this because of all the attachments, but eventually I had to buy another one because it was not sturdy enough to hold up to a three year old."
5,Good quality item!,"Another great Bruder toy! I love the quality of these toys, and my son loves what these bruder toys do! defineatley would buy again."
2,Broke twice in first month,"My son received this as a gift for this 3rd birthday a month ago. He loves construction trucks and has about 15 in his collection so far. The excavator is his favorite truck, so this is his favorite toy. He can put figures inside to pretend like they are driving it and he likes to take it outside and pick up dirt with the bucket and put it in his dump truck.After about a week, a plastic part of the boom disconnected, never to be reconnected. He continued to play with it and ignore it, but after about 3.5 weeks, the bottom part of the boom broke as well. Which was the source of alot of crying in our house. Although he did play with the toy alot, he's not especially rough with it. And, of all his trucks, this is the only one that has broken beyond repair so far.We will be buying a new excavator toy, just not this one."
1,Arm broke,"I bought this excavator for my son for Christmas. He was so excited to play with it. But like another review states, after a few minutes the gray piece in the arm does not stay where it is supposed to and falls down every time he tries to manipulate the bucket. He was crying on Christmas morning b/c it would not work correctly. We used tape to fix it but it was still very disappointing. Do not buy this."
1,not to be played with,"Nice looking toy, but considering it is made for a young child not worth more than a few dollars.My son loved this excavator for 3 days before it fell apart. When I received it and saw how flimsy it looked I was concerned about durability and my worries were warranted. My son played with this toy as you would expect a 3 1/2 year too...not abused.Don't waste your money. I am in the process of finding a replacement."
4,This is a great book if you are intrested in Peru,This book tells about it all from all sorts of people from the conquiers to the Indeans plus the shing path and the Presedint
4,The Peru Rueader,"I haven't gotten too far in this book yet, but it is a very diverse and comprehensive overview of Peru's history. Some of the pieces are of a more ""textbook"" nature, but inclusion of poetry and other sources makes for a less boring read than the average historical tome."
2,Excited in a sleepy kinda way,"It was a quick read, I enjoyed the well known authors, but didn't much care for the unknown ones. Felt like this book was published late, if it was closer to 911 I would have cared more."
3,Its all black and white,"It seems a well written and informative book, but i wish any one of the reviewers had mentioned there are no color plates at all here, everything is black and white, I would have gone elsewhere had i known as there are others to choose from. I don't understand the reasoning behind such an economy at all."
2,Very disappointing plates,"This really wonderful book by Clark, with its good introduction by Martin Kemp, was marred by the very bad quality of the plates. They're all black and white and every one is washed out (with the exception of the color cover), perhaps because the printing plates are old and worn out. Shame on Penguin for releasing such a poor quality product, especially in these days of quality reproduction. If you can be content with just the extremely good text (I was not), no problem, but be warned. The copy I received 3/11/09 was a 1993 reprint of the 1989 edition."
1,Leonardo da Vinci,"This iw the worst book I have yet read. While the concept of the Biography is enhanced by the plates and drawings, the foot notes don't correspond to the propper painting. The facts of his life don't even go hand in hand with Leonardos notes on himself. Other journalists and recorders of Leonardos time dictate him as being a marvelous genius in which all aspects of talent blossomed from his soul at some point in his life. If this books had any basis in researched fact it would have been reviewed by the Museum of Science and Technology in Milan. And by the National Historical Preservation Society and since it has not been,. Anyone interested in - da Vinci, read for yourselves from the masters own hand writing, even if in translation. This book a pathetic fallacy on a great man."
3,Not for the first time traveler,"I bought this one, and also the Frommer's Paris guides. This book would be perfect for the frequent Paris traveler, that has already seen all the major tourist attractions and wants to get more information for the best and out-of-the-way dining, shopping, and hotels. It's very consise in those areas, but definately not for the first time traveler."
4,ChiRunning is for me!,"There's always mixed reviews when it comes to running styles and the books written about them. I think Danny's method works for certain people such as myself. Since starting his method, I've been pain free and my legs and feet are getting stronger, my runs are easier and longer without much effort. I was a heel runner and suffered with multiple injuries, aches and pains and now I'm pain free after a half-marathon. This year will be my first time using the method in a full marathon and I'm sure it will help me cross the finish line faster, healthier and injury free.This book isn't teaching you to be a world class runner, it's teaching you to be a more efficient, pain-free and joyous runner. The bent over technique may not work for some runners, but it may work for others."
4,Great companion with the Chi Running book,I have read Danny Dreyer's book on Chi Running but I also wanted the DVD as a companion visual guide to my journey in improving my runs one day at a time. I like the principles I am learning from the DVD. My husband doesn't have the motivation to read the book so he watches the different sections of the DVD.
1,more bleh,"Nothing on here reached out and grabbed me. The only real gem is Monkey King with 72 Magic, and that's only if you were a fan of the Monkey Magic series back in the 70s (80s?).The ones that are good are only decent, and the ones that are bad are so horrible even mst3k fans will have a hard time having fun with them =\"
4,Still great stuff,"I came across this book while searching TURKEL's Web site. It's a nice retrospective of the agency's work over the years for some pretty impressive clients. Granted, there's not a lot of cutting edge guerilla/viral stuff like Crispin does, but this book was published long before anyone knew what that was! Still, you'll find solid design and well thoughtout strategies to inspire you."
2,"""Brain"" Dead?","A towering monmument to mediocrity. With the exception of a handful of first-rate ads (Designing Eye furniture, Discovery Channel, The Peabody Hotel), the creative showcased in ""Brain Darts"" is devoid of wit, daring or originality. It's second rate stuff that doesn't begin to compare with the breakthrough work routinely created by fellow Miami agency Crispin Porter & Bogusky. I can't believe they honestly believed the ads for Bet Shira, Bacardi and Multivision - to mention just a few - actually merited publication in a book. This shows a shocking lack of judgement on the part of the authors."
1,Brain Dead!,"it's just rehashed, old and boring.....it is chest beating at it worst...It is like a glorified portfolio for the company."
1,"""Darts"" Misses The Mark","For me, this book was a bust. It's not that the creative is terrible: it's just not terribly good.So why give it one star as opposed to, say, two or three? Because of the utter lack of originality that pervades much of the work. For example, the Elbow Beach Resort ads are a pale imitation of Goodby Silverstein's far superior NCL campaign. Likewise, the work for Bet Shira is a shameless ripoff of Fallon's lauded Espiscopal Church ads of the 1980s. And the cover? It seems like a swipe from Target. As a marketing ploy designed to raise the agency's profile and impress potential clients, the book is undeniably brilliant. As a collection of original and daring creative, however, it is sadly lacking."
5,Brain Darts: Smart Creative Made Simple,"""With Brain Darts, Turkel Schwartz & Partners helps people better understand how simple and magnificent creative thinking and problem solving can be. Bruce Turkel's illustrations make the complex and esoteric very clear. His style and humor make the process of learning a joy. Of course, you can't articulate this stuff so well and make it so real without walking the walk, and Bruce Turkel does that part with long strides and a nice bounce in his step. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to get the most out of this visit to the planet..."""
5,Awesome Pants,Use these as a goalie in hockey. Keeps my legs warm during some slower games. Love these pants for less then 20.00.
1,WSI Hockey Jock Pants,I ordered this product over a month ago and never received it. My rating of this prouduct is very poor because I NEVER received it. Due to Amazon's inability to deliver this product I am unhappy with it and Amazon.com. I wil be heading back to Hockey Monkey for all future hockey purchases.
2,"Works, but only worth 1/4 of the price.","I searched for the best dual socket adapter. The Lind brand claimed a higher current handling capacity due to ceramic insulators. Not in the one that I received. It's all plastic, same as the $3.99 ones. It did have a paper sticker on the back of the package showing the Lind part number but the adapter itself had some no-name logo decal on it. No replacable fuse of LED indicator either. Most likely a cheap knock-off. Besides paying way too much for this, the handling charge was close to another $5.00."
1,accupressure mittens not worth it.,"To my dismay the gloves aren't for self-treating the hands.They're for pressing on other spots.They don't work well and they tire your hands. Better tools are out there.Get""Trigger Point Therapy Workbook""by Davies for Real Answers."
5,Excelent book.,An excelent book for those who want to explore the political identities of leaders in times of change. Easier to read than other books on the subject and deeply engaging.
2,tooooo bad,"Considering the prestige of the author and the publisher, this should have been better documented and better edited. Miguel Enriquez is spelled just like that, not Henriquez."
4,pretty impressive for the price,"I knew from the HV20/30 forum that this converter would be better than the original Canon converter. It indeed does a very good job at wide angle. As expected, less convincing at full (10x) tele zoom.Bottomline, nothing to complain about for the price."
3,He was a man without mercy.....,"From back cover: Kaara knew that before the night was over, she would become Juan de Carvallos's possession. Abducted, held prisoner, she would be ravished like some captive woman of old, a victim of the Spaniard's lust for revenge against her brother. Fear clogged Kaara's throat so that she couldn't speak. It was like a nightmare - but the man facing her was real. ""You can't prevent me from doing what I want with you,"" Juan said harshly. ""I'll keep you shackled close to me, Kaara, until you learn to love the chains that bind you."""
4,The I Love to Fart Cookbook,"Not only does this book contain recipes, any man would love, it was fun to read as well. Wonderful entertainment, made me laugh until I cried. My family's favorite recipe, Those Stadium Stinkers!"
4,Faltulence Forever,"Outstanding book of recipes, fart history and little known facts. Each recipe is rated. Humorous comments about each recipe are included. Something for everyone. My favorite is Thunder Wafers!"
5,:),"Oh snap son, this is off the chain. i load this thing UP and it still stands plus its easy to put together if you can read. shoot you might not even know how to read but i bet you can still put this sucka together"
4,"Good book, but not excellent.","If you are newbie, you should buy it. But dont expect a definitive guide."
2,Chillingly repetitcious,"While this is a truly disturbing tale of a very sick man and my heart goes out to each victim and their families the book could have been written in a fraction of the pages used. The author repeats the same information in exactly the same way over and over and the story looses the impact it should have. While Tim Bindner is a creep and the author clearly expresses that point, he really doesn't give us enough about the victims. These poor little girls must have had a very terrifying last few moments of life and there is no punishment Bindner could receive that would compensate for that."
2,No evidence.,Philpin just kept beating me over the head with nothing. Very biased and unkind view of a kind and gentle man.
5,I'm still waiting...and hoping...,"I'm waiting and hoping for the follow up book that features his arrest. Regardless of how I feel about him, I hope these girls are brought home, if anything, for closure.Evil never triumphs in the end, though in this case, good seems to be the tortoise to the hare. May justice be served.Excellent book."
5,fun,"if your kid s a Pinocchio fan, this is an interesting version, This was very popular in the 80's and has been re-discovered"
1,.,"I got this a long time ago when i was about 5 or 6. I must say, this game scared me and still does. It is also a very very VERY boring and repetetive game, i'm almost positive that if any pro gamers heard of thisg ame and played it, it would be in their bottom 3.."
5,Speakless when you hear this voice,"This entertainer, crooner, singer is still marvellous. Completely wonderful disc which never bored. A master in his branch with eternal music."
2,Not a good showcase for Bennett's great talent,"Fred Astaire will never be remembered for the songs he sang. These songs were only great while he was dancing to them! I am a huge Tony Bennet fan and felt so disappointed by this CD. The songs gave him nothing to ""wrap his voice around"" or put his heart into. I listened to it many times, hoping it would grow on me, but after six months I'm still disappointed. His other tributes (to Sinatra and Billie Holliday)are so much better. Sink your money into those!"
5,distant lover,I really liked the version of distant lover. I wish I could get it on a cd or mp3 so I could listen to it on the road.
5,"Great Book, but Kindle Problems","I love this book, and my problem isn't with it, but the Kindle version. This is the second Danielle Steel book I've gotten for Kindle that has had spelling errors by the dozens.For me it takes away from the story when I find errors on almost every page."
4,One of her best,"I am a huge fan of Danielle Steel and I found this to be one of her all-time best novels. I've read it probably 20 times and love it more each time. It's definitely a tear-jerker and once you pick it up, you can't put it down. I would recommend this to anyone who's as big a sap as I am."
2,extremly boring,"most of danielle steels characters are stereotypes-suffering females who have brief bursts of joy-oodles of suffering-and then all the stories end happily ever after.sabrina-is good,her mother is bad-her son is bad-but almost becomes good before he dies, please---i don't even know why i read these books-----they make hardly any sense--and leave me feeling really hollow. in some ways an ordinary mills and boon scores better----atleast there is humour and interesting talk. avoid this book-u can do better stuff with ur time."
1,Oy vey . . . This book . . . is rather . . . stinky.,"My ""friends"" persuaded me to read this one, as I had admitted to never having cracked a Danielle Steel in my life. Now I know why. This is so poorly written, every page felt like a chore. Steel's constant use of ellipses . . . makes the reader . . . feel like an engine is . . . sputtering. How does this woman sell so many books? Must be the sex. Of course, the book got me riled up to write this review, so it must have affected me somehow."
1,Did Not Receive Book,"Never received this book. Filed a claim. Claim has not been processed.It appears I have lost the payment. It is to late to get it now. The purposefor ordering this book has been surpassed. And it it is not needed now.So if I don't get a refund, I will contact my credit card company fordisposition."
1,Let me be blunt.,"I did not like this manga. I have always gotten completely angry when little kids threw around animals like they were toys, even when I was their age. This manga frustrates me so much. To think that she'd actually have the guts to throw a Ferret around like a doll just sickens me. I couldn't even finish the first volume. I don't think I will ever show this manga to my future kids, in fear that they would probably try it themselves."
5,Light and Fun Read,"This is a story about a girl named Amanda who gets a ferret. If you want some though-provoking novel, then this book isn't for you. But if you want an amusing book, and don't care how ""childish"" it is,read this book."
4,Fun AND educational,"My daughter is seven and a half and loves this book, She's read it many times and keeps coming back to it. It teaches a lot about ferret care too! I had ferrets as pets for over a decade and I think this book would be a great way to start talking about the responsibilities of taking care of a pet.I have very high standards with children's literature. Since there is so much out there, why settle for something less than perfect? This book may not be great literature, but it'd fun. I haven't found a single objectionable thing in this book."
5,Genuine Product,"I just received a couple of these ""offered and shipped"" by Amazon. They came with the red thumbscrews and look and work exactly like my others. These were not knock offs. These are also the best mounts you can buy. They are smooth and lock the flash head or ball head very positively. You can't even force your equipment off of them."
1,Pass this one up,"How can you mess up a simple shoe adapter? I concur with the opinion of other reviewers that you may not get what you thought you were getting--at least from one vendor (Adorama). The unit is supposed to work by pinching the outside of the hot shoe. Enough pressure to hold a heavier object is likely to bend the hot shoe. I would have thought that there would be a piece to actually slide into the shoe--much better mechanically--but no such luck with this piece of junk. Perhaps it might work on some cameras, but that list doesn't include Canon.Perhaps it's a good idea never to buy something like this sight-unseen. I sure won't."
2,Don't hold the flash...,"They don't work worth a crap on the SB800 flash,,,, Twice now my flash just fell off my Beauty Dish and hit the floor... I even used pliers to tighten it, still don't hold the flash good... Just not engineered right.. I have a tether cord on my flash not just in case..."
5,Legitimate,"I received exactly what was ordered, a real Stroboframe and not a knock off. It's anodized metal. The price was right."
3,should not have purchase it,Nothing wrong with the product. Its really good.just that i should have used my 600ex-rt shoes instead of this.[...]
4,Stroboframe Bracket Shoe Mount,it works better than the stock ones that came on the umbrella/light adapters.
1,BEWARE!,"Adorama Camera will pull a fast one on you and send you a cheap knock-off,which, even though it's a simple enough product, is built like crap.In order to get the flash shoe to fit, the thumb screw has to be backed all the way out, which then causes the tiny springs to fall out. If you're not careful then the spacer on the thumb screw, which I think is the culprit being slightly too long, will also fall off. Adorama wants the parts returned in new condition for a refund, HA!"
2,Not as advertised,"This product was advertised as a genuine Stroboframe product from Tiffen. The one sent by Adorama was a no-name knock off.It does the job (let's face it, this is not a complex product), but it was not the product advertised.After two attempts adorama refunded the money, but the whole purchase left a very bad taste in the mouth."
4,works as intended,"purchased 2 of these to hold my speedlites (580EXII and 285HV)on stands.I was originally using the plastic foot that came w the 580EXII, but had issues with the flashes slipping out.The red knob is a bit small, however it and the metal bracket work well enough to tighten so I no longer worry about speedlites coming loose.If I were to purchase replacements or additional units, I would look for:1.non plastic knob2.larger knob.3.possibly knob 1/4"" further out from bracket for easier adjustment w speedlites on top."
4,Good but could be better,"Received the item promptly. Good built, and has a nice smooth feel to it. Stroboframe had this bracket shoe mount design for a long time and hasn't evolved it. They could have changed the knob with something that is easier to hold and adjust."
5,As always...,"Those cold shoe are perfect, this one comes with a round headed screw to hold it where ever you want. Buy this instead of the 12US that is around. I use them to be on my manfrotto's umbrella bracket and my manfrotto nano lightstands. Works great...!!!!"
4,Silliness! Watch to be entertained.,Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece. This is a silly movie. Watch and enjoy as you would a Monty Python episode.
2,Snorefest,"As stated by another reviewer, buy the theatrical release, it's much better. The pacing of this movie is way too slow."
2,Disappointment.,Short and sweet: I didn't laugh throughout the entire movie. It's lack of comedy is dwarfed only by the ignorance of the producers for making such a film. Shame on you Ben Stiller. We expected better from you.
2,Better Ways To Spend Your Time And Money,"I thought with the cast of this film that it would be much better than it actually was. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but close.Just spend your money on a sharp stick and poke yourself in the eye, you'll have more fun than watching this."
1,BLAZING SADDLES?,"Blazing Saddles? No way! This thing has more in common with HOT SHOTS PART DEUX!Painful to sit through, not funny for long agonizing stretches, save 110 minutes and just laugh at Robert Downey in blackface in the trailer, because it's the only thing funny here."
1,horrible,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Adding Tom Cruise, Matthew McConaughey didn't help also. Robert Downey jr. was very annoying.Thank god I rented it. Because if I bought it -it would have gotten thrown out."
1,"YOU CAN CALL IT A ""SPOOF"" .....",".... or any other adjective you care to embellish upon this travesty. ""TROPIC THUNDER"" is the most desensitizing, degrading excursion into the realm of film-making I've ever witnessed. With the obvious target audience being young men and teenage boys, it will be sadly interesting how many psychotherapist's journals in decades to come will have reason to enumerate the long-term effects of ""TROPIC THUNDER"" on the psyches of the young and once-young, precipitated by this cinematic free-fall into a foul-mouthed, mind-numbing vortex of ghastly depraved graphics (while for 106 minutes ""innocently"" cloaked and selling itself as a ""humorous spoof"").I didn't like this ""humorous spoof"" movie.Not-at-all."
1,Not for everyone,"This movie is not for everyone. Some of the blood and guts humor was not funny to me. I know, it is just a movie........just a movie not for me."
1,A WASTE OF TIME,"Aside from the first 5 minutes, which were quite funny and creative, this film is one of the worst I have ever endured. I can't see how people are saying they laughed through the whole thing and give it such high ratings?After the intro I didn't laugh once. The film made no sense, I honestly can't see how so many fine and well known actors agreed to do this mess! When I think of all the time involved in making a film and the cost! What a waste. Luckily I rented from my library and didn't spend a cent."
1,Absolutely stupid,Don't waste a dollar on this. Looks like several actors needed some play money and decided to do skits in a full length movie.
3,Tropic Thunder,"Tropic Thunder is a reasonably funny parody of several Viet Nam war movies including ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon"". The cast includes Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Nick Nolte, and Tom Cruise. They all bring their particular talents to this movie, without which this would be a pile of bat guano. I was surpised no Private Gomer Pyle and Sergeant Carter showed up. When a group of actors is dropped into a real war zone somewhere around Cambodia after their director can't get them to cooperate, things get dangerous and interesting. A new side of the actors is seen, and not necessarily a better side on all cases. Jack Black's character wants to jump into the Heroine in the camp where they must rescue their technical advisor, FX man, and a fellow actor. Good quality DVD with a few extras. Lots of cursing, so not recommended for anyone offended by it. If you enjoyed this catch ""Scary Movie"".CA Luster"
3,Funny BUT....,"Tropic Thunder is an entertaining and sometimes humorous spoof about Hollywood making war movies.The ""humor"" in this movie ranges from characters who often lose touch with realty, genuinely funny, to bathroom and anal humor which, to me, is simply poor taste masquerading as funny lines or free speech.This script gives Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise an opportunity to expand their range of character portrayals and they both rose to the occasion with apparent zeal and ease.I rated this movie 3 stars.Without the crude humor it would have been a five star video."
4,Extremely Funny!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present. I think this movie is very funny! It has an awesome plot and very good actors! When 4 snobby actors try to make an action war film, they all screw up, so the writer of the book of the film they are making suggest to take the actors into the jungles of Vietnam to make them see what it's really like. They run into a heroin factory who kidnap Tugg Speedman and hold him hostage and make him perform as a 'special' kid in a movie he did a long time ago. Will the actors make it out alive? I highly suggest TROPIC THUNDER!!!"
3,Thought it was going to be funnier,This movie came highly recommended by my friends so I bought it immediately. Every actor did a great job playing their part but when it all came together it was a little weak. There were some very funny parts here and there and at some points they tried to squeeze in some emotion.Great Blu-Ray picture.
5,Plenty of heat.,"This film pays homage to several great war films such as Bridge over the River Kwai, Apocalypse Now, and Saving Private Ryan. We see the camraderie build as in a classic war film. I can overlook the Howard Stern-type crudeness and admire the finesse of the cinematography, and the dead-on impressions of Hollywood. The real meaning of the movie is that the U.S. lost the Vietnam War, but Hollywood not only won the war but conquered the world. It should be watched by anyone whose childhood happened during the Vietnam war, because it is therapeutic. But another reason that I, as a woman, watch it? Incredibly hot guys in uniform!"
2,Sparingly Funny - not enough though,"I very much looked forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, most of it did not work out for me. The movie just wasn't funny enough throughout. I enjoyed the fake previews adn the actual beginning of the movie, but other than that the rest of Tropic Thunder fell apart. Just because the movie has an all-star cast does not mean the movie will be a good one. Quite disappointing. Doesn't hit the spot for me."
5,Tropic Thunder Unrated Director's Cut,"This product was exactly what I ordered, widescreen and everything, and it arrived within a few days brand spanking new."
1,An Off Day,"Ok we all have off days our thoughts jumbled you know a yuck moment.Here was mine,I liked everyone that was in the movie but yuck.I have tried to get threw this movie twice and I just can not do it.I would have been better off if I bought the commercials.So this was my moment of shame when I purchased this movie,I will have to live with the shame lol."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"FIRST THING I DONT IMAGE HOW THIS ACTOR CAN BE CONVINCED TO DO SUCH A BAD MOVIE, IT'S NOT FUNNY, IT DOESNT TRANSMIT A FEELING OR A SITUATION AND AFTER 5 MINUTES YOU START HAVING THE URGE TO FINISH THIS PUNISHMENT OF THE MIND, ACTUALLY THE BEST MOMENT OF THE MOVIE IS WHEN YOU THROW THE DVD TO THE TRASH ....."
1,S sandwhich,"This is a terrible movie. The dodgeball film Ben Stiller did was much more palatable, which isn't saying much. They've taken three of the most over exposed actors, two of which aren't even really actors, and given them a horrible vehicle. The veritable avalanche of Jack Black and Ben Stiller projects is begining to taste like so many doses of castor oil. It's begining to resemble the Will Ferrel syndrome; please make it stop. The Tom Cruise ""cussing jewish producer guy"" was so over sold that when I watched his performance I was just left scratching my head. The same can be said for the black face Robert Downey; it's funny that he's wearing an afro wig and lowered his voice a few octaves? I don't get it. I'd rather watch 'Kelley's Heros' for the 20th time."
1,offensive and a waste of time,the war sequence was completely offensive...there is nothing funny about people getting shot and ripped to shreds in a war...even if the intent is to spoof other movies. that left a bad taste in my mouth from the start and almost made me shut it off completely...it didnt matter because it was so unfunny and un entertaining that my wife and i fell asleep not even half through the movie.
2,Robert Downey Junior stole the show!,"First of all, why would Ben Stiller be the star? His character was not funny. Jack Black had a few moments, but not many. Robert Downey Junior was the best character of the movie. I have never seen anyone play a black man like him! My husband and I are also black and we thought that he stole the show. Even when he just said an average line it was funny because he made it so real. I can actually imagine a real person being like his character. We are also a military family and you would be surprised at how many people can take it all to another level. I have to admit that I didn't look to see who was in the movie first (my husband bought it), so I didn't even know that he was in it at first. It actually took me a little while before I realized that it was him! He did an excellent job! I didn't think that the movie was that funny, but he saved it. Without him I probably would not have watched all of it."
4,fun to watch,Robert Downey jr was incredible in this.He is very versatile and one would not know it was him at first. it was a fun movie to watch
4,So funny,I love this show. You do have to be in the mood for crazy comedy to fully appreciate it though.
4,Not the Issues You'd Expect,"Much was made of Downey Jr.'s foray into the culutrally sensitive issue of wearing black-face for the movie as well as the use of the word ""retard.""However, the name of the game was satire from the word ""go."" This movie didn't mock African-Americans or the mentally disabled - it mocked Hollywood trying to make a big deal of these issues.At the end of the day, this movie is mocking Hollywood stars trying to the best it can to make money, and names, off of issues. You can see dozens of Hollywood stars in the characters portryed by Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey, Jr. and (insert name of the kid in the movie).Tropic Thunder acheives its goal and while it drags a bit in places and is not ""falling off of your chair laughing"" throughout the entire movie, it is quite funny and if you are able to ""get"" what Stiller and co. are trying to do, it's a great film."
2,Not as funny as it thinks it is,"I really can't believe the other reviews here - I'm thinking that Ben Stiller has created dozens of Amazon accounts and is posting positive reviews....By now you know it's a spoof. I read one of the reviews comparing it to Blazing Saddles - heresy. This is rubbish. What story/plot (I know it's a comedy) is paper thin. Stiller and Black are going through the motions. Downey is only interesting because of his black/white thing.It's essentially an unfunny spoof Rambo. You remember that ""coal miner"" segment from Zoolander - it's that kind of crap for 107 minutes.The only thing getting it above 1 star is Tom Cruise (yes you read that right) - Tom Cruise is intentionally funny.Inane, pointless, drivel."
2,Terrible even for a comedy,It has a few funny moments but its too lackluster in between those moments to really enjoy the movie. Dont waste your money buying it. Rent it.
3,I'm a LEAD FARMER!,This movie was pretty good but not as good as I thought it would be. It had some funny lines and take offs on Viet Nam genre and a heck of a cast. Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise stole the show totally. Ben Stiller was ok but just ok like he is in most of his movies.The movie was pretty good but not the over the top laugh fest I thought it would be.
2,Not very good,"I had high hopes after reading the reviews and hearing the hype. However, for me, this movie fell flat. I found it more stupid than humorous. I came away disappointed."
5,Tropic Thunder,"One of the best films of 2008. Robert Downey Jr. steals the show with one of the best performances of 2008, as ""the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude."" Great supporting cast including Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Nick Nolte and Tom Cruise."
1,What was all the hooplah about. This movie is unbearable!!!,I attempted to watch this movie w/ 4 other adults. we could not even get past the first 30 minutes. I t was absolutely horrible. Whats up with all the rave reviews from critics. I am glad that I only paid a dollar to see it out of the redbox machine. It's not even worth a 1 cent rental fee. This is a new low for GAYLORD FOCKER-his real name is escaping me at the moment!
1,Ben Stiller proves once again that he has zero acting ability,"The only reason I watched this movie was because Robert Downey Jr. was in it. Watching Ben Stiller play next to Robert Downey Jr. was gut wrenching to say the least. Robert Downey Jr. preformed flawlessly of course and carried the poor script and most of the scenes as much as possible. Ben Stiller was horrible however, proving once again that he has no acting talent what so ever. Tom Cruise pulled off his disguised nasty producer part pretty good except for his dancing scenes. I have seen several of Ben Stiller's movies and he just never seems to get any better. Someone please drag him to acting school and chain him a desk so he can learn something. Can I have my movie rental money back please?"
1,Thought this was dumb.,"I thought this was one of the dumbest movies I've seen in some time. It was, in my opinion, a total waste of my time and money."
1,Not worth watching,"I thought this movie would be funny with Stiller, Black and Downey in it. I was very upset with paying $20 for this movie and being disgusted with it. Every other word out of anyone's mouth is a F-bomb, I guess they thought if they could cuss alot it would make the movie better. There were a VERY few moments where you may laugh, but the rest was not worth it. I dont know about most people, but watching Tom Cruise with a fake gut and bald head screaming and yelling at everyone on the screen and then trying to save his screen time by dancing at the end of the movie was HORRIBLE.You need to rent this movie before purchasing it unless you are into crude humor."
1,Yuck,I couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes. Gross and crude. Is it me? Where have the good movies gone? The concepts seem good but the writing lacks imagination w/o sex and gore.
3,Funny! Esp if you know the movie industry,"Some slapstick humor but if you are familiar with the theatre or movie industry I think that you will really like it. I found the humor very funny regarding the acting aspect of movies and/or Hollywood. Sometimes stupid, but some movies are just cotton candy entertainment."
3,"Stupid movie, but some funny dialogue...","This movie was actually better than I expected. I was expecting to give it one or two stars based on what I'd heard about it, but there was some funny dialogue throughout the movie and Robert Downey's acting was excellent. I also enjoyed the Tom Cruise cameo."
1,Overrated,"There was no comedy in this movie whatsoever. No real jokes, no witty dialogue and too much choreographed political incorrectness (race, mental disabilities and sexuality).All in all one big budget, all star disappointment."
1,Tropic Garbage,"It was painful to watch this movie. One the few movies I stopped midstream. What utter trash and horrendous script containing an abundance of unnecessary profanity. Yeah, I appreciate spoof movies but this one is a must avoid."
2,Rather dull,"If you've seen the trailer and liked it, don't go any further : all that is worthwhile is there."
3,Hollywood conceit.,"Well, Tropic Thunder didn't win anything Sunday night. But that doesn't take away the fact that Robert Downey was the funniest thing in this movie. He an Aussie playing a white American playing An African-American soldier. Actually its a movie about a movie about Vietnam. Do I have that right? Anyway, it goes horribly wrong, deadly & at times offensively funny. Therefore, everybody in Hollywood wanted to have a cameo in it. Apparently everyone in Hollywood loves Ben Stiller. The audience at the Academy Award was laughing uproariously at his antics as a presenter. Sorry. He's just not very funny. But that just me. Lot's of Hollywood insider stuff in this movie that I didn't get either. Plenty of starpower in this mediocure, at best, movie."
3,Wierd/Funny,Not your regular spoof. Yet parts of it will make you bust out laughing and other parts..uhh?. It has its viewers.
2,Not impressed.,"I would say that I am a Ben Stiller fan but I was not very impressed. The best thing about this movie was Robert Downey Jr., that was good acting and good make-up. My kids are still haunted by the panda bear scene, HA! HA! I would say that I liked the Love Guru and Zohan better, what does that tell you about 2008's year of comedies."
2,Boring,"I had high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, the humour was stupid at best and the movie felt like it was thrown together with little thought"
4,So Wrong...So Good!,Come on people...LAUGH! This movie is hysterical and Robert Downey Jr. gives such a stunning performance that you have to watch his scenes over and over again to get all the jokes.
3,Hit and miss,"First up, this has some incredibly funny scenes in it. There are parts when I was laughing fit to burst.The only trouble is, these bits were spread out in between some very lame or average parts which lasted far longer. On the whole the film outstays its welcome, but it's worth seeing for the few bits that really are extremely good.A shame it wasn't consistently good, then it would have been worth five stars.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
3,Lots of dings,"The video stopped at around 1:02 during an especially funny part of the movie. It finally skips its way over the bad spot but you miss a whole scene. I checked the disk, and it has lots of dings on the playing side. Lots of scrapes that won't rub off."
4,:),"The beginning is slow, but you will definitely be rewarded for sticking it out. The rest is funny as hell!"
3,okay,I didn't realize this was only the director's cut. Not as good as the theatrical version. Returned it to get the original version.
1,Worst Film Comedy of All Time,"As comedies go, Tropical Thunder makes Porky's II look like something by Noel Coward. Embarrassingly tasteless and unimaginative. Not even the magnificent Robert Downey, Jr. can save it.Horrible through and through, from the script to the direction to the cast (excepting Downey). I'm still looking for someone who can explain why Ben Stiller and Jack Black are successful film comedians. Neither is a bit funny. Stiller looks okay, I guess, especially considering who his parents are, but Black doesn't have good looks or anything else going for him. He's like John Belushi without the talent.Don't even slow down to glance at this dead skunk.Jeff Huber"
1,It would have been OK (just OK) if it were not for the foul language,I didn't see this in a theater and I am glad I didn't waste the money. Lots of potty humor and way way too much foul language just for the sake of foul language. It could have been made with much less bad language and been funnier. I gave the movie away to a friend (hope we are still friends after he watches it). Please say there won't be a sequel.
1,Worst movie ever!,"This movie is awful. I want my time back. Do not waste your money or time on this film. It's a draw for worst movie of all time between 10,000 B.C. and Tropic Thunder."
1,A big disapointment!,"The cast seamed fabulous. The trailer was funny. I had great expectations then the movie started. Bad taste, not funny jokes. I zapped it because I got bored of this non-sense.The two strong points are: Ben Stiller's fabulous biceps and Robert Downey Jr's acting. The rest is just not good.I honestly don't see what people who gave it good ratings found in that movie but maybe I just don't get the Hollywood's inside satirical critic?I wish I could give it a zero star!"
1,Did not enjoy the black humor.,"I ordered this dvd for my husband, who insisted that I watch it with him. I did not find any redeeming qualities in this movie."
1,Train Wreck,"Absolute train wreck. Too long, too little plot, too much swearing, noisy, painful to watch. One pointless explosion after another. I couldn't wait for it to end.And to top it all off it's a movie about making a movie."
1,This was a really bad movie!,"I expected this to be campy, but it was just way over the top. Jack Black plays Jack Black. Ben Stiller plays the Zoolander (again). Robert Downey Jr. plays a black man and is convincing and interesting, except I couldn't understand half of what he said. Tom Cruise is surprisingly funny and Matthew McConaughey is good.But the movie is just stupid. The premise is funny, and I knew the premise going in - prima-donna actors doing a film on Viet Nam go off-set and think they are still filming a movie when they get caught up in a drug lord operation and are under real attack.But it is poorly executed and just over the top camp.I'm clearly in the minority here, so as a guide to others let me say that if you like Zoolander then this movie is for you. But if you prefer your humor to be a little more intelligent then this will let you down."
2,This movie makes fun of the dead and the wounded in strange ways,"This movie makes fun of the dead and the wounded in strange ways. For example, in one scene a soldier stepped on a land mine and was blown to pieces. However, his head was intact. A short while later, one of his fellow soldier put that head on a stick and waved it around. I don't feel it's funny."
4,A funny satire,"This movie pokes fun at some classic scenes in war movies such as Platoon. It has a lot of comic relief, however, may not be appreciated by those dedicated Americans who served and endured the horrors and hardships of war. Overall, entertaining if you keep it in the perspective of satire and not a slap at our brave warriors."
2,Too ugly.,"It contained way too much profanity!!! And many of the props were used in a very ugly way, i.e., wounds. Granted there were some funny scenes...but too few & too far in between."
4,Hilarious,"Tropic Thunder is a great comedy that has some fresh ideas. At some points pushing the envelope in material which adds to its greatness. The entire cast works great together, and Tom Cruise when on screen steals the show."
4,Hilarious,This movie always makes me laugh. Nice to order and get it so quickly in the mail. Popped it in quickly and remembered why I liked it so much.
4,This movie is insane!,"I really like this movie! It shipped right away and I received it when I was told I would. This movie is really crazy and sometimes I ask myself ""Did that really just happen?"" But I received a brand new copy of this movie and it was in pretty good condition. I've already watched it and there were no problems as far as I am concerned."
2,faulty,"The dvd skips and picture cuts outs, watched directly after receiving and opening so not a consumers fault, not happy with the quality of purchase"
1,"Dire,rubbish,bad beyond belief","Wish I'd gone with my instincts and not bothered. Ben stiller is as funny as piles! has never made a good movie,ever! lesson learned again after just 25 minutes of this rubbish."
1,Disrespectful?,"O.k. where do I begin? Yes, I thought the movie had some very funny moments and if the subject matter wasn't based on men who actually died this way in real life, I probably would have laughed harder. Yes, I know, it was an unrealistic view of war and over the top, however, ask any Vietnam vet if he thought this was remotely funny. I was even born yet when Vietnam was happening, yet this offended me in some ways. I wonder if Mr. Stiller would find a comedy about Auschwitz just as funny. Bottom line? Yes, a funny movie, but the subject matter(which is war and death) should be respected and not the subject of slaptick comedy."
1,Unbelievable boring!!!,"It's incredible that with such good and funny actors as Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downet Jr., the only thing you long for, while you're watching this movie, it's the end of it."
1,You must be kidding.,"The only possible explanation for this movie is to target 12 to 13 year old boys. Nobody else could possibly think that this is worth the time to watch it. One of the great frauds perpertrated on the American public is that Ben Stiller has ANY talent. You can add Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell to the list of no talent movie ""stars""."
1,Tropic Thunder,Terrible. Terrible. It is a satire and a bad one. What a waste of money and time. Sorry guys but I am also surprised. Best. W
1,Words can't describe how dumb this movie is.,"The product itself was great and I would order more movies from this seller again. As far as the movie itself, I wasted the 1.00 for the movie and the 2.98 in shipping. I cant undo the star I put as a rating, I wish I could put minus stars. For the seller, I would put 5 stars, the movie, not so much. I think If I had the choice between this movie and 2 hours of Barney, I would take Barney. The only redeeming quality in this movie is Robert Downey Jr. and how he played a black guy, that was pretty funny. And the one scene where Less whats his name (Tom Cruises roll) when he made the key grip punch the director in the face, ""really f'ing hard"".But, yeah... even if its free, it wasn't worth it."
1,Simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!,I was very disapointed with this film! I just watched it for the first time last night and after an hour finally just turned it off. I can't understand with all that talent how the movie could turn out so poor. It's funny that individually I love several of the actors in the film but they did not mesh at all. The script & diologue were just horrible.
2,Disappointed,Tropic Thunder was not as funny as I thought it would be. Also not as good as past Ben Stiller films.Too drawn out and stupid.Only good things about this movie were Jack Black's performance and the Tom Cruise cameo.
2,Disappointing,I thought it would be funnier but I was disappointed. Harold and Kumar was much better
2,...RedBox Rental...,...everyone says this movie is sooooo funny! i disagree!!! there are a few funny scenes but overall its just not that funny.
3,entertaining and some funny stuff...,"I found the movie pretty good and entertaining. I just saw it a second timeand still found it good. but as the previous reviewer mentionned, there isa little surprise in the movie and come out as Les Grossman. There wassomething different about this character...i just coul'dnt put my finger on ittill he started dancing in 2 places in the movie...these 2 parts ,,i dont knowhow , but improved the movie with its music and moves....then i found out thatLes Grossman is played by the one and only John Travolta....Atta Go John...good work and thank you Ben Stiller for keeping the dancing and not deleting it.A keeper"
2,Tropic Blu Ray S*@#$,"Watch it at the movies, loved it. Finally got my hands on the Blu Ray and was extremelly dissapointed with the picture quality. Parts of the movie the quality really played to the strengths of Blu Ray whereas some parts especially when it is dark it snows on screen!!!!I can understand if it is made in the 80s or the 90s but this was a movie released in 2008??!! What the F???!!!The sound on the other hand is good as with most Blu Ray releases.It is a pity about the pic quality, as this is a great movie and the Blu Ray extras are awesome."
4,As Funny As I Had Hoped,"Wow! Filled with lots of star power, although predictable still funny. Would definitely recommend. Tom Cruise totally surprised me, I had no idea he was in this movie and it took me a minute to figure out who he was. The voice was so familiar but wow, ...."
5,Laugh out loud,this movie is hilarious. I laughed hard the entire time. Acting is top notch and for a comedy that's amazing.
4,Uneven but a lot of fun; good satire,"The comedy is somewhat uneven in this full-frontal farce from Ben Stiller, but it is a great satire about the movie business, producers, actors, directors, awards, and more. Robert Downey Jr. is the most politically incorrect one, playing an Aussie actor who gets his skin darkened to play the role of a black man in a movie about Vietnam. His comments to Stiller about the latter's ""going full retard"" as Simple Jack are just priceless. Yes, they're politically incorrect, but we could use more of that!Jack Black holds his own as a bleach blond, druggie whiner, while Tom Cruise takes the cake as a chubby, hairy, obnoxious and abusive producer back home in Los Angeles. And Nick Nolte is perfectly cast as the grizzled Vietnam vet whose book is being made into a really bad movie."
3,Not Oscar Material But good humor for what it is.,"I did not think I would be surprised by the twists. I was thankful for these as they covered up my disappointments in where the script really dragged on painfully slow. It was good enough to make me laugh, and say more then once, ""No way! They did not just do that!"""
4,Camouflage comedy!,"Rude, crude and completely hilarious, Tropic Thunder hits the mark by being shamelously offensive to everyone. For those who liked war movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and of course Apocalypse Now, this movie is not an homage but a spoof of all of them. The drastic step the character Lazarus(Robert Downey Jr.)takes to play his role is extreme in which he completely immerses himself in the role almost forgetting who he really is. Another great twist is having Tom Cruise play someone so radically different from his usual roles(his dance scenes are memorable). This movie is full of surprises and very entertaining!"
4,Enjoyable,"Great fun. I haven't enjoyed a comedy this much in a very long time. While the pace of the movie did die off at times, it was more than made up for in other parts of the movie."
5,Better than Batman!,"I saw this film seven times in theatres when it was out. I couldn't get enough of it! This movie is definitely worth it for Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance alone - the man can do no wrong. The fake trailers at the beginning are comedic gold, and the film itself is great! I started laughing when Scorcher was being advertised and didn't stop until the credits stopped rolling. This was almost better than Iron Man and definitely better than the over-hyped Dark Knight."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted to like Tropic Thunder. I was looking forward to seeing it having heard some good reports. In the end though, I just didn't enjoy it. There were some funny moments, and the production was very good - it's slick and impressive to look at, especially on blu-ray. But the film is let down by a dull plot, and empty characters. I just didn't care about any of them - they were all one-dimensional. I know, in a way that that is the point - they are all supposed to be one-dimensional actors - but that joke kind of carries on into this film, making Stiller, Black, Downey et al all seem boring. Downey Jr. is great, but the joke wears thin, and is kind of dealt with in the first few minutes of the film.I found myself longing for the more nuanced character comedies of Steve Martin, John Candy, Chevy Chase etc. The Three Amigos, for example, was a similar type of film, carried off with a more absurd humor, and some genuine warmth.For all the explosions, Tropic Thunder left me cold."
2,My Eyes! The Horror!,"This movie had its funny moments, but nothing to earn the rave reviews I have read about it. Maybe I'm not enough of a Hollywood insider to catch all the jokes and references.It's really a horror film. Tom Cruise. Dancing around in a hairy fat suit. Grinding his pelvis. OH. MY. GAWD!!! My eyes are still burning. I am going to need years of therapy to get that horribly creepy image out of my head."
4,"""Never go full retard""","But these guys did - and IT WORKS.The pros far outweigh the cons. It's quirky, insightful, irreverent and funny as hell. A couple of slow moving/overdone scenes are the only real cons - otherwise a lot of fun."
4,Frickin' Funny,"I LOVED THE PARODIES, AND THAT EXCURSION INTO THE FACE OFF BETWEEN DOWNEY AND STILLER IN THE EXTRAS IS A VERY GOOD CHARACTER ACTORS PORTRAIT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FORTITUDE."
3,Good but the original cut is actually better,"A friend of mine came over a few months back with a DVD of Tropic Thunder (original cut). I thought it was hilarious, especially the beginning parodies of movie previews. I liked it so much I order this here blu-ray thinking maybe i'll get something extra out of the director's cut. Turns out the extra scenes in the director's cut were cut out of the original for a reason, they aren't funny. Not only that but they hurt the continuity of the movie and the characters. I would have really preferred if watching the theatrical version was an option on this blu-ray but it's not. I'll be trading this for the original on craigslist if there are any takers."
3,Love the movie but issues with the BluRay,"I absolutely love this movie and it's why I ordered it. I think it's one of the funniest, savvy and intelligent comedies made in recent times.My rating is a 3 for this disk because I don't actually have a BluRay player but the disk does not allow me to download a copy to watch on my laptop like other BluRays I have purchased.Why did I buy it? Because I have been able to watch a downloaded version. And, I plan to buy a BluRay player in the near future, anyway.I also followed the insert's instructions to go to Paramount's BluRay website which no longer exists. So, I tried their UltaViolet website and this movie isn't even listed there. Too bad. I'll have to wait a little longer to see it."
1,Vulgar,I like Ben but it has way too much foul language and Tom Cruise looks horrible and his Character is not likeable. If you think cussing and putting down others with foul language funny then you will like this. This movie is not for children.
5,Great can opener!,It's a great can opener. It's sturdy. It locks in the can. Someone recommended it to me so I bought it. Made to last.
5,Works Fast and Easy,Very ergonomic and perfect gearing for large strokes. Once the Zyliss clicks together over a can you know its properly set for instant cutting. I've had mine for almost a year with not a single mis-cue. Plus I like it's fun looks! I highly recommend.
4,smooth access,I needed a can opener that was carpal tunnel friendly. I was impressed the first time I used it; the over-sized knob and ease of turning were nice. I do think the item is a bit bulky for storing but I can manage. The product instructions were very clear unlike reports from other reviewers. I was successful the very first time I used it. I am thinking of buying one for a friend with similar hand concerns.
5,the best,"this is a great can opener, ignore the haters. We had some cheap PoS and I got this cause it was the nicest looking one for the cheapest price, or at least it hit that price/nice sweet spot. Works well, easy to turn. Buy this one and not the others."
5,"As Usual, Great Zyliss Product","We got this can opener(Zyliss Lock-n-Lift) to replace our Kitchenaid one which was a waste of money. Every Zyliss product we've tried has been fantastic, and this is no exception. The lock on this opener holds the can tightly for a quick, easy open. The release button is in a convenient spot. I love the magnet on the end to lift the lid out of the can- no more cuts on my fingertips! I usually rinse the opener in hot water after use and set it in the drainer to dry. I also rinse cans before opening to help keep the opener cleaner.I highly recommend this opener!!!!!"
5,Superb! Especially good for Seniors,"Zyliss Lock-n-Lift Can OpenerImagine opening a can being pleasant. No, I am not nuts; please read on!For several years, I have owned this Zyliss and each time I open a can, I am again impressed with the ergonomics, ease, quality, and longevity of this product.The ultimate can opener test: Open a rectangular can of sardines with the Zyliss (of course the can must have rounded corners)? Forget the pull tab on the can because this opener does the job better and the lid is completely severed. Why do I care? Because I can now pour out all of that tasty juice along with the sardines. Rinsing the can afterwards (a must to keep family members happy) is easier because the lip on the edge of the can is gone.Today, I sent a Zyliss to each of our (very senior) parents with the thought and assurance it will make their lives much easier.Who says a better Can Opener can't be invented!Oh yeah, it also works equally as well on all cans I have opened!"
1,Broke after 5 cans,The cutting wheel could only be accessed by holding opener at an angle after only using it on 5 cans. It would not cut the can lid at all. Am switching to an automatic opener.
3,Can Opener,"The product works all right but doesn't seem to be any easier than my old one which is many years old. Still, it works."
3,Magnet on top is very weak,The magnet on the opener doesn't work very well to hold or lift lids off of the opened cans. That is specifically why I purchased this can opener. It opens the cans with no trouble but most openers do!! I purchased it to lift the lids and hold them so they don't fall into the cans and this one does not do what it's supposed to. When it's time for a new opener I'll not buy this brand again. I'll be stuck with this dumb thing for years I'm sure!! Lol
4,Seems sturdy,"After destroying 2 can openers in the last year, I decided to do a little research before my next purchase. Have had 2 higher end openers crap out on me, but this one doesn't seem likely to die anytime soon. I don't like the locking feature, but its a minor annoyance, and as other reviewers mentioned, the magnet to get the can lid off is kind of laughable... I usually just leave a little can uncut and bend back the lids so they don't fall in, so I don't use it anyway. I have had it a few months now and it seems to be doing fine, but I will update if/when it dies!"
5,Easy to use,Just remember that the thingy that you rotate has to be at the top to get the best results. You could do it with the thingy in the side but then the top falls in.
5,Love it,"I have wrist and elbow problems, so I was looking for a can opener that was easy. I found it!! My 10 year old son can use this thing. I would recommend this to anyone who has limited strength in hands and or arms. Well built, seems like it going to last a long time. I am buying another one for my elderly parents."
4,Awesome can opener!,Ive had this for a few months and its great! cuts through tin like butter and is very comfortable in the hand.
5,My mom loved this and asked for it for Christmas,"When I had my most recent child, my mom came to help out. She fell in love with our can opener and asked for one for Christmas :) We love this can opener too. It is very easy to use which is nice b/c I have early arthritis. This is the BEST can opener I have ever had. I would definitely recommend it and many of the other Zyliss products!"
4,Good opener but difficult to use,"I would gift this opener five starts, but it just isn't the easiest to use. I love Zyliss products - very high quality and this one doesn't disappoint there. However, you have to apply the opener perfectly or it doesn't close smoothly. Also, it is difficult to use the magnet. By the time you release the opener and position it just perfectly to get the lid, the lid has already started to sink into the can. Now, once you get the lid, the magnet release is a really neat feature. I just wish it was a little easier on the hands."
3,love it... mostly,excellent most of the time but if you don't have it just right on the can it will not latch and sometimes finding the sweet spot takes a moment. Aside from that it's been a great can opener and I would absolutely buy it again. BTW I've owned this for a year or so now.
5,EASY to Turn.,I have ordered these before. I found them very easy to turn. I would rather use these than bother with electric can openers. I had an older twist can opener on our boat and could not even turn the handle.
5,Best can opener I've ever owned,"After fighting with cheap can openers for years, I bought this one. Very simple and easy to use. Amazing the difference between a good one and some of the ones I've used in the past."
4,Works great,"It works, hasnt shows any signs of rust (yet). Works as expected and has out-lasted all of my previous openers."
4,whaaaat,best can opener i've used. i hate manual can openers and electric ones always crap out after about a year. this one works better and faster than a cheap electric and saves counter space. yay!
5,zyliss opener,love this opener. you can use it with one hand once you lock it in. great for someone who can't use 2 hands.
3,Good item but not great....,I purchased this item because my cheapo one was really hard to use. I'm left handed and it can be difficult to use the manual can openers when positioning and opening cans. This can opener does what it's meant to do and does it fairly well. This item has a lock feature that's handy. The actual motion to open the can is much smoother and requires less effort than my old can opener. The main disadvantage is the price. For $14.95 (Macy's) I expected to get an opener that would create a beveled edge. I have small children so this is really important.I wouldn't recommend buying this one go for the one sold at Target instead that bevels the edges. You spend the same amount of money and get more useful features.
3,A gift,"I never got a chance to use this product, but I bought it because of reviews and it fit the bill. Nice grip and big knob was well received by someone with little counter space and no room for an electric. I'll post more info when I find out more about it's operation. It came well wrapped and ready to start cranking. I feel like it was a very good purchase."
4,great can opener!,"A very heavy duty style--I like that it locks closed and fits nicely in the drawerthe magnet is OK, but not really a feature I need"
2,Can Opener,The can opener in clumsy to use. However it gets the job done. The magnetic feature is difficult to use.
4,no sharp edgeas,"This can opener is great, easy to hold and does not leave a sharp edge. also it has a magnet to remove the lid after you cut it off."
5,I looked and looked,"I looked for a manual can opener for years. It's not all I did. I bought a lot of bad can openers. This is the best can opener I have ever owned, and I don't expect to buy another one for years. I've had it for three months or so. It hasn't slipped once. Perfect operation. Perfect. I will buy anything this company offers."
