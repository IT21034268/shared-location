3,Disappointing,"Gilbert presents a huge pile of evidence to the effect that we are not so good at predicting what will make us happy. In the final chapter, Gilbert offers a solution--if you want to know how X will make you feel, consult others who have experienced X. Individuals are enough alike for this to be revealing.This advice presupposes that to be happy we need to strategize our way toward greater happiness. But do we? It's possible that the happiest people don't aim at happiness at all. They have a set of values and they live by them. They ""stumble on happiness"" as a result of being immersed in doing things they find worth doing. Are the happiest people those who try to be happy or those who are focussed beyond themselves? Sucked in by the title, I thought I'd find out by reading this book, but I did not.A final complaint. There is a joke in nearly every paragraph of this book. If found 99.9% of them distracting and unfunny."
2,"Appreciate the effort, but nothing new here","Reading this book was like listening in on a rhetorical conversation that started with 'Isn't it weird how we always think....blah'I decided that this book has the knowledge equivalent of a conversation you would have with good friends over a bottle of wine, except you have to read this one.Sorry, but I found myself wanting to hurry through this book looking for some gripping anecdotes or new insights. I think this book marks the official end of the whole 'Tipping Point', 'Blink' and 'Freakonomics' movement. It's all been done to death and now this book is giving the academic treatment to things that we all realize ourselves, but still do.I appreciate the author's effort but I was underwhelmed."
5,Must read...what a perspective on our thought process!,I have since bought 5 copies of this book and given them all away. I loved it so much I also purchased the audio copy to hear the author himself verbalize his wit personally!
2,"not very impressed, this book is overrated",I was not very impressed.I had to force myself to read the second part since I lost much of interest.Author's inclination to try to be funny and insert lame jokes everywhere became a turn-off.This book is overrated.
2,Not impressed,"I was expecting a Malcolmn Gladwell type of book where interesting ideas are backed with solid evidence but more importantly narrated in an engaging way. Unfortunately, this book did not have anything I didn't know and the author's style was repetitive and boring, definitely not like Gladwell's. If you want an easy read with somewhat interesting topics, go for it but otherwise it's quite forgettable."
2,Waste of twelve bucks,"Fscinating message. Too bad about all the rest. Wordy, self-importnt, meandering, and unfunny, this book takes a random walk through poor allusions lame jokes and irrelevant trivia to fluff his message from its proper size (5 pages would do) to a book he can feel justified collecting 12 bucks for. Skip the book and just read the wikisummary or the NYT review."
2,"boring (er, sorry, Dr. Gilbert)","Big fan of popular science books, especially books in the social sciences. I like nothing more than reading books likePredictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our DecisionsorNaked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science. I'd read anything done by Malcolm Gladwell, for example.Yet I found this book a struggle to finish. Given Gilbert's reputation, I expected it to be mind-blowing. It wasn't.Weeks after reading ""Predictably Irrational,"" I was left with many examples that simply wouldn't leave my mind. I kept thinking about the studies done in that book.Nothing like that happened with this book. Once it was over, I forgot about it completely."
4,Pretty good,"I found this book very interesting, but the writer tries to be too ""cute"" too often. However, the facts were very interesting."
5,Amazing Series,"When I first saw the first season, I was hooked. Great voice and Characters. Love how they made this like a RPG game. Level up while getting more characters to fight evil. Love it. I cant wait season 3 comes out or gets made. I will wait til it comes out to buy it.If you want to see season 3 in English subtitle. Go to dailymotion.com and type in d Gray man 52. 52 is right after set sail to the east called Raid next episode. If you have real player. you can download them onto real player and once there on your computer you can make them into movies. real player will download them into mp4 format. I took 52-103 season 3 and put them on my HTC Evo and Ps3 to watch them."
4,An anime review,D Gray Man is a great anime but this particular set of episodes are mostly fillers. But fillers with good stories. Funimation needs to license the rest of the series. Hopefully one day.
3,Grainy but OK if put on thicker.,The base in this latex is a little thin and the rubber particles are quite grainy. I put it on a bench top for a non-slip surface and I think it will work well for that. I poured it on and then used a fluffy roller to spread it out. I also put masking tape around the bench so it formed a tub of sorts. After I smoothed and leveled it as best I could I got a couple of rubber mallets and pounded on the sides and underside of the bench top to shake the surface and that seemed to smooth it out fairly well. I'm not sure how well or how good this would look if you put it on thin. Seems to have dried well and it seems to be OK so far.
3,Could have been better,"Not one of their best records but it was nice to see HR back in the line up. The track "" Justice Keepers"" is a great track but most of the others seem to lack the intensity of their previous work."
4,Underrated,"This is an underrated album. Maybe not the best Brains (It is short on hardcore/heavy tunes and BIG on reggae and HR sounds like He's dying on a couple of tracks) but worth having for 'Justice Keepers',Long Time,& 'Thank Jah'. 3 Great songs in their respective styles. Overall 4 Stars for just being Brains."
3,"Keep your hopes down, and your heads while you're at it...","'Complete and utter disappointment"" is the words you'll likely hear from any true Bad Brains fan, after inquiring about this album.It's not the move to a major label--better distribution and better studios/production, how could we complain? Add to that, the reunion of all the original members (H.R. could never be replaced, let's be honest), and it probably seemed like a good idea.And it would have been, even going (as this album does) the ""Quickness"" route and maintaining a metal stance as opposed to their earlier thrashy sound, but the songwriting just isn't there, and the conviction is lacking.Is it better than ""Rise""? Sure, but not by much. While I'm happy they could get together for one more album, the truth is that it doesn't hold up to their earlier releases, and outside of a few listens, you won't be tempted to slip it in your discman that often."
4,the New Bad Brains,"This album lacks the sheer energy of ""Bad Brains"" and ""Rock for Light,"" but no one else has recaptured that energy either, so I can let 'em off the hook. The songs are a bit forced, but the power of ""Cool Mountaineers,"" ""Thank Jah"" and ""God of Love"" give the album a potent religious focus and their gospel mission comes accross. Did I mention that this album beats the hell out of ""I Against I""? Well, it does. The songs are almost all straight-up metal, punk, dub or reggae except ""Rights of a Child,"" and HR's voice shines."
3,Understand the culture of the South Tyrol,"This is an academic treatise from a few decades ago. Let that be said right off the bat. It was recommended to me while I was in the South Tyrol (at the regional museum in the village of Dorf Tirol in 1988) when it was an obscure book available to me only in the reference section of the Free Library of Philadelphia (I could only read it in the reading room). Now I own my own copy, and having read it, I understand a lot more about the nature of the South Tyroleans as a part of Italy (which neither they nor the rest of Italy really want to acknowledge). So, on return visits (several), I have been better able to understand why the villages just south of the old Austrian border look and act differently than those to the north. If you have been, or are going, to the Sud-Tirol (Italian: Alto Adige) and really want to understand it, this book will help you. If you want a tour guide, look elsewhere."
5,love this little phone! keeps it simple!,"This is a phone.It does not sing, dance, tell stories, or download garbage.1#You can make calls.2#You can send and receive text messages.3#You don't have to constantly charge the thing.4#It will survive a drop.My eight year old and thirteen year old love theirs. I got both of them one and I don't have to worry about them accessing websites or making an obscene amount of puchases online. It also has been a great way to teach them responsibility. I would recommend this little phone to anyone."
4,"nice phone, screen easily scratched","my 13 year old son is satisfied with this phone, so that's a pretty good recommendation in my book. He scratched the screen the first time he put it in his pocket; that would annoy me but he doesn't care. Putting it in a baby sock or something similar before putting it away would be sufficient protection."
4,simple and effective,"With this phone you can make calls and send messages. It's light, inexpensive and easy to use. No photo taking, internet conection nor fancy gadgets in it. But if you are looking for a regular phone this is your choice. Simple as that."
4,motorola motofone,greay little phone.would be better if you could download music.other than that it's a good phone for kids. compact and cute.
5,"If I could only buy one book on guitar scales, this would be it.","This book is by far the best teaching method I have seen in writing. It cannot be beaten for the price. The author does not just give you the scales, he clearly explains all of the theory used in developing the scales and then explains how to use the scales to develope your own leads. I have many scale books and many instructional books and videos. If I had to choose only one, this would be it."
2,Fiction Not Romance,This is the first of her books I have ever read and I thought too that it is more of a fiction book than romance. It was a long fiction book at that.
2,"Fiction, not romance","I was expecting this book to be more of romance than fiction. The story focuses on finding the outlaws who killed and robbed money from the McKettricks. Amanda poses as a nun, but Kade McKettrick believes she is hiding something. Her past catches up to her when Gig Curry,a mean, old bf of her mom's come to threaten her life for her half brother, Cree. Kade becomes Marshall when the one prior to him had a stroke. He captures Gig after a horse race who is accused of murdereing 12 soldiers and robbing. Throughout the book they try to solve the problem. They also try to resolve the relationship between the McKettrick brothers and Holt.I thought the story reflected too much on the outlaw problem rather than having it focus on the relationship between Kade and Mandy. Romance is lacking in this book, which is why I would call it more fiction than anything else. The book was a bit dry. This is not something worth buying, perhaps buy as used or rent from library."
1,JUST HORRIBLE!,"I have read more romance novels that I can count and I think this was the VERY worst. I had to force myself to finish it. There is no real love story. The plot is unbelievable and lacks depth. This was the first novel I have read where I didn't like the female lead. YIKES! MAIN problem I had with this book, Kade was thoughtful, caring, sweet, mild mannered, a book worm actually, the peace maker of the family in the first book HIGH COUNRTY BRIDE, In this book he is a marshal, pig headed, rude, thoughtless and childish! BIG ERROR on the Auther's part!I am going to read the 3rd in this series on the hope that Miller gets her act together!"
4,Not a bad read,"I read this book in one sitting and while it is a rather lengthy book, I think some of it could have been edited out. There seemed a lot going on with a lot of different people and I didn't feel as if there was enough time spent on Kade and Mandy. I enjoyed Rafe and Emmeline much more in this story than I did in High Country Bride, a book I didn't really care for. But, again, I enjoy LLM's style of writing in her western romances. I think she does a very clever job of it."
2,hmmm . . .,"""You'll adore the McKettricks . . ."" raves Romantic Times. But if you're like me, by the end of this book you'll be hard put to even like the McKettricks. Nearly every one of them's got a mile-wide mean streak and a stunning inability to actually apologize. Ever. And what is it with this book, any way? In 20 pages it can go from boring to funny to romantic to philosophical to gruesomely violent. Don't get too attached to any of the minor characters, either; the author manages to kill a surprising number of them off."
5,Shotgun Bride,Love Linda Lael Miller and her McKettrick series. The book arrived in a timely manner especially since it was christmas time and mail is usually slower.
3,Amanda Past,"There are a lot of twist and turns in this book. Sometimes they get in the way of the main plot. Amanda has a past she is trying to hide. Kade knows in his heart that she is trying to hide something. However Mandy is special to him. It is a good read if you don't let the sub plots get in your way. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
2,I wanted to use the shotgun!!!!!,"This bit of fluff was ok but........no passion, no excitement, wham, bam, thank you maam. I like to read stories of the Old West where 'men were men and women were women', but this was a trifle boring. Concepcion, the housekeeper (sp) had more personality than anyone else in the whole book.I almost didnt finish it and waded thru to the end to see how it all turned out. This is my first western from LLM and I will get her future books from the library."
2,Where is the old Linda Lael Miller?,"I can't believe this is the same author who wrote, powerfully passionate romance, such as, Corbin's Fancy and Banner O'Brien. I keep buying her books hoping for the return of that almost erotic feel in Banner O'Brien. The first love scene in this book was the biggest let down. Where isthe fire, spark and flame? Shoot, more Mandy didn't even get any foreplay???? Oh well, Kade is happy. I gave this 2 stars because I love the the idea the stories are built upon."
2,snowcap,"I've read other books by Ms. Miller (Corbin's Fancy & Yankee Wife) and I smiled & laughed throughout the books thoroughly enjoying the interaction between the two main characters, but not this time. I'm disappointed with this book & hoping Secondhand Bride & McKettrick's Choice will be better since I've already purchased them."
4,Confused,"I'm confused since reading this book and starting the third book. In this book, a secondary character, John Lewis tells Kade to send a telegram to his daughter, Chloe. In the third book, Chloe Wakefield arrives at the Triple M and says she has come to see about her ailing uncle, John Lewis. So, is Chloe his daughter or his niece? And, just how old is Angus McKettrick? I can't figure that one out. When he and Concepcion announced they were expecting a baby, I thought he must be in his 50's, another review on this book says he's pushing 80. If that's so, them expecting a baby is a little out there. Even if he is in his 50's. I'm glad I didn't pay any money for this book. I was reluctant to read another LLM book because the stuff she puts out now I don't think is even written by her. This was an earlier book and I thought it ought to be good because she probably did write it. It was in fact, pretty good."
1,Shotgun bride,This story lacks the romance its back cover promises. Yes there are wedding bells but what a disappointment to learn more about the family verses the relationship between the two main characters.
2,"Western only, no romance...","I loved the first book in this series, so I was excited to read Shotgun Bride. Unfortunately, for me it was too much ""Western"" and not enough drama/romance. I am all about romance novels with depth and great storylines- I'm not in it only for the sappy stuff. This book, however, went into WAY too much of the Western-type book. I am not a fan of hearing gory details of men who were murdered, how they were murdered, how bloody and gory the scene was, and how they were scalped or ""butchered."" There were SEVERAL of these scenes in this book. The book dragged on for me, and about half way through I realized that it was just a book to get through to read the next in the series- and HOPE that it is WAY better!! I really think the author was going out on a limb and trying something new for herself with this book- and I'm sure certain audiences would love it, but not me. I don't regret reading this book but only because I want to read the entire series."
4,THe Virgin River series by Robyn Carr,This series is one of the best series I have read. The little town and the characters come alive and makes you wish you could be there. When I have finished one book I can't wait to start the next one. I so hope she keeps going with the series. Definitely a winner in my eyes.
3,gift,"brought them for my manager for xmas, she said the they were ok but would have like other flavor in there. only came with 2 differant ones. flavor also don't last to long"
5,Timeless,"This is Trini at his best. A timeless rock 'n' roll classic with a boistrous crowd to boot. Each song (with the exception of ""Yeah"") is a gem. Put this on at any hip party and watch the rug cut. I would take this album to my grave."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I was new to calligraphy when I got this book, and I was expecting a book that had many different styles portrayed, with an explanation of what each could be used for, and instructions with exercises on how to form the letters and practice the art of calligraphy. The book contains several common fonts (not many by any stretch), but only includes details about how to form the letters for some of those fonts. It does not provide exercise sheets, nor give specific exercises for the fonts. I got the book because I'd decided to start my venture into calligraphy by learning the italic font. Well, she does not give adequate instructions for that font. I could get better information on the formation of italic letters on YouTube. (And I did!) This book has sat unused on my shelf ever since. I'm honestly surprised to see two, five-star reviews here. I foundLearn Calligraphy: The Complete Book of Lettering and Designto be far superior, and used that book instead."
3,"some interesting stuff, but overall dull","I usually like books like this, with questions that many people ask themselves and simple, to-the-point answers. Unfortunately, this book isn't all that great. First of all, many of the people who supply answers tend to present theories as facts. Secondly, the answers aren't always quite as concise and to-the-point as one would like. For example, should it really take two pages to say that we just don't know if dinosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded? Questions for which we have no answer probably would have been better off edited out of this book. Then there are the occasional answers that wander around all over the place without really answering the question. Overall, a pretty disappointing reading experience."
2,Needs work,"First off, I love the size. It also came undamaged.Now for the rest:The handle gets way too hot. The tea did not stay warm for as long as I had hoped. Even on my tea warmer, it just stayed barely luke warm. Pet Peeve: They put a stinkin sticker on the cup, right near the handle, that takes superman to get off. Now I have this sticky mess.It's going back."
3,its ok,"I have used this cup multiple times, and I'm looking for a replacement. Its a little too heavy for backpacking, and I've been leaning toward getting something lighter. However, its a good cup if car camp, and Overall its ok."
5,Wonderful Record!,"For me, the late 50's and 60's Bing's voice sounds the best. Mellowed and deepened with age. It's incredible. Clooney sounds perfect, and is an excellent match for Bing. Don't listen to the other reviewer here. This is an amazing collection and both singers are in peak form. Do whatever you have to, to get your hands on a copy. You'll want it for your collection."
3,That Travelin' Two-Beat/Sings the Great Country Hits,"Another fun to listen world travelling show in dixie sound and a sequel of 'Fancy Meeitng You'. (That Travelin' Two-Beat) A good combination with Rosemary Clooney.A boring combination and lacking for his color (Great Country Hits)So, a half of four stars and another half is two and thus overall three stars."
1,"Horrible, horrible toy. And Y is for yacht?",Worst toy ever. No volume control and the volume is SOOOO LOUD. The LEDs are brighter than the sun. We wouldn't let our son play it because it drove us nuts. Then we wondered why we even had it and threw it in the trash.Do yourself a favor and just throw your money straight in the trash instead of buying this.
3,Trip on This,"Words cannot describe the profound sense of peace and tranquility which eclipsed my heart upon hearing this soundtrack. Just like ""G"" said in the motion picture, ""We all gotta keep things 'real'"". Finer words were never uttered.When ""G"" fantasized about becoming the Terminator, I was like ""Woah"". That's da bomb. This album's tight, but not as good as Diddy's new joint."
3,ridiculous.......yet tiny glimpses of perfection,"The reviews of this book encouraged me to read it. I have to say I was disappointed. First and foremost, the book is overpriced, so don't purchase it unless you can find a used version. Second, I truly found it to be a waste of time to read about two people who truly craved each other...who were supposedly soulmates...but played games and wasted each others' time. Life is too short. Why did these characters continue to torture each other and deny the obvious until later in life. Ridiculous.However, the proposals that the character ''sang'' under the branches of this ''magical'' tree were quite impressive. Beautifully written proposals that would woo any woman."
3,Useful but not what it implies,"The book goes into all the steps of iconix (a kind of lightweight RUP); It uses small examples drawn from an ecommerce system implementation; It shows top ten errors in each step of the process.However the implication is that the book takes you through an eceommerce example using iconix (use cases, activity diagrams etc) but it doesn't. It takes you through the theory of Iconix and shows disjointed fragments of the system. There is a lot of good stuff in there, but a fully worked example would have been far more useful, especially as it is described as a companion to another theory book.So, useful bot as good as the description suggests."
3,Pricey for what it provides,"I was excited about this book when I bought it online. Now that I read it, I am not very happy. The authors could have drilled deeper into some examples of how to implement the application using some wide spread technology like Java or ASP and COM. Giving concrete examples of what a Boundary Object should be, or what classes make sense to implement to interact with databases, just to mention a few, would have been very helpful. I also found ""the top ten error"" method very tiresome (I often skipped it and went straight to the right ways of doing things). The book was helpful though in providing a guide of what steps to follow in the design process as well as giving us a good idea on how to break the project into objects and diagrams."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,THE SOUND RECORDING IS SO BAD IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE LISTENING TO IT UNDERWATER WITH A HEARING AID THAT HAS A LOW BATTERY. BUY ANY RAY CHARLES RECORDING BUT THIS ONE. I LOVE RAY CHARLES BUT EVENHE WOULD TELL YOU TO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BY SOMETHING ELSE. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
5,Amazing,Hugh Courtney once again explains with his unique way the types of the uncertainty that a manager might encounter and the analysis that he should perform in order to use that uncertainty for his benefit.I highly recommend it.
2,Nothing impressive,"This book provides bascially no new ideas for strategic decision makers. The only idea it has is to distinguish uncertainties into four levels and this book uses the four-level frame in all its following discussions. If you want to read it, maybe you can stop before chapter three and you won't miss any precious insight by skipping the rest of it."
2,Nothing impressive,The book provides no exciting findings for strategic decision makers. The only idea this book has is to distinguish uncertainties into four levels and it uses this four-level frame in its following discussions. And even the four-level classification is cliche. You can skip contents after chapter 3 without regretting anything.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought the Shure e5c after reading some reviews, and based on using their phono cartridges for years. There is no bass with these phone, even when I get a good ear seal. I wrote to Shure explaing the situation and their Customer Service did not have the courtesy to respond to the message. I then called the 800 number and just got the run around until one of the representatives stated that a new model was comming out shortly and would fix this problem. That does not help me now and by sure I am not going to waste another $450.00 on a lousy product from Shure."
3,Mixed Bag,"My experience with the product is mixed. To be fair, the sound reproduction is as good as everyone says it is. But some suggest this as a good alternative to the noise canceling headsets - it is not. On an airplane, headsets like the Bose do a far better job of excluding background noise; to the extent that I can't use these at all on planes. I really question the ""Sound Isolation"" tag."
2,Shure E5 Fault,"I have used this for nearly two years and have found the sound good. However, the cables oxidse within two years quite badly. On checking with a Shure agent, they claimed that Shure said that this happens all the time and Shure will not do an exchange."
4,Get the fit for the base shure e5c,The best earphones I own and I own plenty. These must fit into the ear canal to get a snug fit and whoa the bass comes alive. I Don't like the stiff cord that is supposed to wrap around the outside of your ear. They are overpriced and at this time you should consider the shure e500 pth( smaller and more flexible)
5,Gallery of flamenco greats,"This boxed set comprises volumes 5-8 of Chant du Monde's definitive 20-CD set ""Grandes figures du flamenco"". The artists are as follows:05 -Ramón Montoya06 -Carmen Amaya07 -Manolo Caracol08 -Manuel AgujetasSince a complete review would be very long, I must refer the reader to reviews of the individual discs for more information. You may also find my So You'd Like To... Guide of the complete 20-disc series helpful."
3,Nopalgarth aka The Brains of Earth,"This is a fairly early Vance book, published in 1966. However it has a feeling of having been written in the same period as 'To live forever' ['56] and 'The languages of Pao' ['58] in being a darker world-view than 'The Blue World' ['65] and the demon princes series ['64-'81].But hey - it is still Jack Vance, out of print and worth finding. Note - two titles - but the same book"
2,PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE,"This is a low budget version of ""Predator"" except we don't see the actual killings and they lace the film with comic book scenes to save money. The special effects were pretty bad and it would have been a better film if they had used more comic book pictures instead of low budget special effects. An alien is attacking a community. The film centers on a core group, but then deviates to total strangers whenever it needs to have it kill someone.The scenes are dark and mostly shot at night. A lot of screaming in the dark type of stuff. Poor camera action to go along with the stiff dialogue.Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, shower nudity- An odd scene where a teen gets out of the shower to answer the phone where she says she would do nudity in a film. Seems like they were trying to launch a career, but I didn't see her in the credits."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This movie sucks. I like zombie movies and end up buying a lot of B-movie crap so amazon is a common place for me to buy stuff but this movie is really really sucks. I have seen high school projects that are far better than this movie. REALLY, I made it through about ten minutes and threw this crap in the garbage. It is an insulting waste of plastic and thats all you can say about it."
3,101 Ideas All Right But Lacking Unity,"Although I personally enjoy a book like this - individual positions that I can first play out against my computer and afterwards compare with the ""correct"" attacking procedure - you should be aware that that's about all there is to this book. It's not a primer on attacking chess, it doesn't develop an ""attacking theory,"" it just gives you isolated, random examples of attacks (usually against the king) and frankly, you probably have alot of good examples already in your own books."
1,POOR SERVICE,I HAVE STILL TO RECEIVE THIS ITEM I AM STILL WAITING- VERY POOR SERVICE.IDONT KNOW WHAT IS WRONGI ALREADY SENT AN EMAIL TO EXPLAIN THAT THE ITEMS HAVE NOT ARRIVED ON TIME AS SCHEDULED AND ITS LIKE AN EXTRA TWO WEEKS NOW.
4,Musical Calculus - but in a good way,"I've listened to this four times and I'm just scratching the surface. These guys are all amazing muscians. I don't even know how these guys could remember all the tempo changes. The guitarists shred with the metal equivalent of Neil Peart in the background. Think of Iron Maiden at their peak and combine that with Rush's time signature changes but way faster and like 5 changes in one song. Four and a half stars because I think Leviathan (the album before this) is a little better. But it's really just semantics (production-wise they are identical, I don't think that the knobs on the amps or the soundboard were ever moved from Leviathan). Cool lyrics, super heavy, and melodic at the same time. Josh Homme's presence on one of the songs doesn't hurt either (I'm of course a biased QOTSA fan). Great album. Procure it now!"
5,It's grrRRREAT!,"Alot of times when I'm anticipating an album from a band I like, I have high expectations that usually go un-met, Mastodon have managed to far exceed my expectations. They are a truly great band and this album further proves it."
2,Lacking,"I'm a big mastodon fan and expected something better than what they did on this album. I mean, these are just rehashed riffs that they have used before, only now they are rearranging them. There are definitely some stand out spots that caught my attention but wow, overall, it's just a letdown. I'll stick with lifesblood and remission. This band is too popular to make an album like that again."
2,Bad album title.,"When I review an album, I review all the aspects of the album.This albums lyrics are fantasy and don't deserve to be published.I dislike the use of the word ""blood"" in the title, as it offended my adopted cousin.I am in trouble with his father for teaching him about ""death""...The actual music is sub-par. All they do is scream and whine about their problems in life. It sounds as if they are still in high school. But their guitarist is a really good master of the 6 string and knows how to make it sound good.Overall 4.5/10"
1,U a Volta fan???,"if you're a volta fan and want to buy this like i did.....save your money, dont buy it, is almost impossible to catch cedric's voice, too many fx on cedric, ikeys work doesn't shine at all, doesnt sound like volta at all.it ended up in my trash can, metal for teenagers, nothing new.hector cancino."
5,"""Right up there with the best""","Mastodon truly have a great feel for dark, strong music. If you are a fan of the genre you could use adjectives like ""beautiful"" and ""epic"" to describe their sound. This material drove me to pay for it. I wanted to ""own"" it. That is high praise I think."
5,All hail Mastodon.,It Mastodon! Mastodon deliver the goods again. Buy it. You'll love it! The whole CD is great.
3,Its alright.,I heard a little mastodon and thought id try them out i just wasnt a big fan of the vocals and the songs didnt have any real great breakdown points for me but you might like it try it out.
2,Slippery slope,"2 1/2While there is definitely some modicum of ambition that makes this metal stand out, not many of the songs really click into an all-enthralling whole, giving the impression of a growing band, operating in a limited genre, itching to explore outside."
3,Get a new singer!!!!,"All this group needs is a real singer. Musicianship is excellent! Singer sucks. Anyone can yell! Get with it Mastadon,...you guys have real talent!"
2,Thinking man's metal? Really?,"Everyone keeps saying this is ""Thinking Man's Metal"". If a thinking man can't understand the vocals, there is not much to think about now is there? There has already been a band that has forged this ground long ago, ""Thinking Man's Metal"", and that was IRON MAIDEN. These guys cannot touch MAIDEN in their heyday. The music is good and they have talent, no doubt, but man, what happened to singing a song instead of gagging it. 2 stars for the guitars. Also, the drum fill-ins are cool the first 150 times, after that, it wears a little thin."
2,Cut And Paste,"Watching the creation of the music on the DVD showed me why this left me cold. It wasn't performed, rather it was assembled in the studio. As such, its an exercise in high-tech recording techniques and currently-fashionable metal stylings. The songs are disjointed in construction, and lacking the organic wholeness and grooviness required to make heavy music great. I don't know how it was created, but Leviathan was a much more engaging listen."
3,Teach Yourself Word 97 Visually,It is a very good and simple book for new commers in the computer field.
4,"Good quality, too big to move around",I returned this product for a smaller roll because I needed something more portable. Paper is of good quality.
2,Too much shine,"I wanted paper that was FLAT black, this paper creates a lot of shine. I can use it when I want shades of gray in the background, but it is not usable as a black backdrop for me."
5,Trini Lopez at P.J.'s,"For Trini Lopez fans, this is Trini at his absolute best. On this CD, you can hear the audience keeping time to Trini's tunes with their cocktail glasses, fists and feet. If you love Trini Lopez, this is a must have!"
5,Wish I were there!,"The one constant thought that crosses my mind when listening to Live at PJ's is how I wanted to be in that audience; to soak up that 1960's nightclub atmosphere. A place where gin, bourbon and cigarettes ruled and no one was ordering Skye Vodka or drinking French wine. This is Trini Lopez at his early and hungry best, before the horns, the orchestra, overproduction, time and big money combined to clutter up his clean and unique sound. This is raw, energetic, live music at its best with just a guitar, bass and drums and no toys in between to mess up the signal. You can hear the obviously well-lubricated crowd drowning out Trini when they join in on the refrains and screaming ""one more time"" again and again as they clearly enjoy a night they will never forget. This was entertainment before the smoking nazis and health police forever destroyed the classic nightclub scene."
5,You Won't be Disappointed,"I first learned about this record when I heard LaBamba in a restaurant juke box in 1969. I went around to all the local record stores looking for it. I finally found it. I already had the single of ""If I Had a Hammer"", so I knew at least 2 songs. I loved the entire album. In 2001 Collectors' Choice music released it on CD, of course I got it.I always thought Trini was underrated. He made some fantastic music. According to Joel Whitburn's Top Adult Contemporary hits 1961-2001, Trini was#152 out of the best 200 artists."
5,Ride Beyond Vengeance,"Realistic and tough, ""Ride Beyond Vengeance"" is a remarkable adult western. Great cast! See it."
5,Great music,Quincy Jones is a great musician and so is this CD. It will be a wonderful asset to my collection.
5,A truely magnificent album.,"I'll keep it brief. This is one of the best albums I've ever heard. If you happen to like Rhythm & Blues / Soul / Rap / Jazz, this is the album for you."
3,"an album with great ""old-school"" flavor, but little appeal.","I was sorely disappointed. I expected something better from a great producer like Quincy Jones. Out of all the songs on the album, only 3 were noteworthy- Brandy's ""Rock With You"", Quincy's duet with Tamia-""You Put a Move On My Heart"", and ""Slow Jams"". Better luck next time."
3,Several Highlights,"Tamia. ""You Put a Move on My Heart."" The highlight of this CD. By Far.R. Kelly's ""Heaven's Girl"" is also quite nice, as is the Phil Collins track (""Do Nothing Til You Hear From Me.) The rest is acceptable, but mostly unremarkable."
4,"Too many ""friends"" were invited to the party!","Albeit an enjoyable album, ""Jook Joint"" is, by far, not an exceptional one. The production is typical Q: huge, HUGE...HUGE! And that's what hurts it. The restructuring of earlier Jones' classics (""Stomp"", ""Stomp"", and MJ's ""Rock With You"", just to cite three) and the majority of the album's cuts become exercises in celebrity recognition, nothing more.The best cuts are the jazzier ones (""Cool Joe"", ""Moody's Mood for Love""), although, too, lack the spirit of the original recordings. The pop/R & B hit, ""You Put a Move on My Heart"", is passable Jones.The final verdict on this one is 3 1/2 stars, rounded off to 4."
5,This CD was a well kept a secret. Why?,"An eclectic gathering of folks who party and sing well, that's what this CD is all about. Found it by accident. Heard the Phil Collins cut (Do nothin' Till You Hear From Me), tried to find it at music store and surprise, surprise...it was just a teaser from Q's Jook Joint. Everything, and I mean everything (including the creaking of the hot tub floorboards) is great on this CD. Whoever did the marketing should be fired. Most of my friends never heard nor were aware of the CD. This is one of the best CDs I've heard in years."
5,A LEGENDARY work of art from a true LEGEND!,"It is a tribute to Quincy Jones' stature as a musician and a producer that such a cast would want... no, INSIST... on being included in this project. One listen from beginning to end - reading the liner booklet while doing so - will blow you away! It is a stunning achievement! Want the double whammy? Play ""Q's Jook Joint"" and ""Back On The Block"" back to back! Quincy is probably the most important figure in modern music. Do yourself a favor and get a schoolin' from Dr. Q!"
2,Zen and the art of.....,"With the practice of being present, writing a zen ""memoir seems like a dicey proposition. And critiquing a zen memoir and even more perilous endeavor...lol. The recounting of his life does not attempt to make sense of or understand anything, so its got that going for it...lol. However, being lost in memories while sitting zazen in a forest seems like the kind of activity which would be rewarded by the keisaku stick by Katagiri Roshi.Of course, someone has to document what went on in the formative years of the San Francisco and Minneapolis Zen Centers, don't they?"
4,"Mr, the sky'sa contortionist. The streets are skippin records blaring hiss","Why am I just reviewing this thing, I bought it the day it came out? Anyway, I got so happy when I slipped this cd in and Set Fire.. blasted through my car speakers. Ahhh bliss! Their last record Crimes had taken awhile to grow on me, but when it did it was quite an infectious disease. And while I insantly liked this album, I still like Crimes, This adultery and March on better. This is better than Burn Piano Island Burn though. That album had songs that were waaay too long. Ironically my fav song on here is one of the longer ones : Camouflage, Camouflage. Anywho buy this album, kids, it'll drive your parents crazy.Oh and see them in concert! I lost count of how many times Ive seen them live and its always a pleasure!And buy all the Blood Brothers cds, especially March On Electric Children and my personal favorite This Adultery is Ripe."
4,Merest Survival,"Although one of her most acclaimed, QUARTET IN AUTUMN is my least favorite of Barbara Pym's major novels. It is spare and muted in tone, and its humor is very subdued.QUARTET IN AUTUMN is a study of the courage required of ordinary people when old age begins to take away all that gives life meaning--work, family, friends. It is therefore mainly concerned with questions of survival. Its four main characters are isolated and anonymous London office workers on the verge of retirement. Some manage to continue to find ways to make their lives possible, but the book is also unsparing about how bleak the alternatives are.QUARTER IN AUTUMN is admirably disciplined and honest, but it is disquieting because it admits the possibility of only the merest survival."

4,Nice book,I'm a big fan of Mingus and this book have a nice collection of transcriptions of his songs. But for we the bassplayers there's a lack of info about his bassplaying and his way of play each song...
1,not low rise at all,"I have Hanes mid rise briefs and i bought these thinking they would be a lower rise brief thus the name their given. For some reason the Hanes mid rise briefs are a lower fit than their low rise, which are basically just regular fitting briefs with thinner fabric. So if your looking for a low rise brief, don't let the name fool you, go with their mid rise."
2,Disappointed,"I was under the assumption this was a BOOK, its not really. Its flimsy and more like a pamphlet. While my daughter (2) enjoys the fact that they are talking about ""her"" dad. Its not something i would EVER pay $10 for if i had seen it first."
3,Cute book but small,"My Daddy is a Soldier is a short but cute book. I didn't realize it would be such a small book but it was a good, quick ready nonetheless. It's right on target for a child's level."
1,No different,No different from store-bought brands. Store-bought brands are less expensive and provide the same results. I wouldn't waste my money on this product again.
4,great belt,"I use this belt to support my core when doing overhead presses or pull ups (weak core/lower back muscles due to an injury). The belt is very well made and seems like it will last quite a while. I only wish I bought a smaller size. I am a 36"" waist and bought a size large as suggested by many reviewers. The problem is the belt does not get as tight as it needs to be in order to provide optimal support. I had to cut away 2"" from one side of the belt to get a tighter fit. Overall, I am satisfied with this product."
2,Questionable Understanding of Kant,"Bowie clearly misunderstands Kant and turns him into an advocate of running a business by consensus, a misuse of Kant's concept of personal sovereignty and a misunderstanding of his ideas about property and commerce. He also does not adequately address the limitations of the categorical imperative, particularly the requirement of generalizing maxims, which leads to many odd moral rules...(e.g., never lie....not even to hide Jews from Nazis). For a better rendition of Kant, generally, and as applied to business and economics, specifically, see Michael Berumen's Do No Evil: Ethics with Applications to Economic Theory and Business."
1,Wish I didn't even have to give it one star.,"If you buy into his demented logic, then by all means this is the book for you.However I would recommend any parenting book over this garbage. Try something from the Dr. Sears selection."
1,This isn't Christian parenting!,Dobson again perpetuates the myth that Christ wants parents to hit their children with belts. No wonder Christ wept.
1,ONE MORE MISINTERPRETATION OF THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS,I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY HEALTHY AND CHRISTIAN WAY TO RAISE CHILDREN IS NON-VIOLENTLY.THIS BOOK IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR VIONCE AGAINST CHILDREN. IF YOU WANT NON-VIOLENT ADULTS YOU MUST RAISE YOUR CHILDREN WITHOUT VIOLENCE. COMPASSION IS THE WAY OF JESUS.
1,Why go to extremes,"Mr. Dobson does not seem to understand that there is a ""happy middle ground"" between permissive parenting (a la ""Smart Love"") and the corporal punishment which he approves of. Why not try Anthony Wolf's book ""The Secret of Parenting""? Dr. Wolf rejects the need for punishment, but he also thinks its wrong to think that children should always be made happy and not have to do what they want (as is recomended in ""Smart Love"") The philosophy in Dr. Wolf's book is that you as a parent must be in charge but that harsh punishment simply is not necessary to get well behaved kids. Dobson's book is bad because it inflicts punishment when it isn't necessary. I say try something like The Secret of Parenting before deciding its necessary to hit your kids."
1,There are better ways.,"While Dobson isn't as bad as the Pearls, there are better ways to discipline your children. I can't imagine Jesus ever striking a child for any reason, so why should I? My children are taught by my example, and with firmness, but never with physical punishment. There just isn't any reason for it at all."
1,child abuse plain & simple,"I am a parent of a spirited girl. I understand desperation. But hitting is NOT the answer! If you're in need of help, look up Attachment Parenting and try Gentle Discipline."
1,Christ's True Teachings,"Many well-meaning parents are going to read this book, as I did, with the expectation that they are going to be taught effective methods for disciplining their child. And, they will be disappointed as I was.This book runs totally counter to my concept of Christianity. To me, Christianity is embodied in the life of Christ. His life was characterized by consistent compassion for others...even for sinners. His life's message is perverted in this book.Christ's teaching, in my opinion, can best be summarized by: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Would any of us accept being hit..particularly being hit by someone who is several times our size and who has complete power and control of us?I would dare to ask parents who are tempted by this to remember this true meaning of Christ's teaching. Christ is empathy..not bullying."
1,This book deserves no star: A psychologists perspective,"...Despite the fact that MOST psychologist promote positive reinforcement, he decides that spanking is still good based on what his bible teaches him. Sure, the bible can be a great piece of work for some people, but I would rather have a doctor who expands his mind past philosophical text from thousands of years ago..."
1,sad idea for a book,"I can't believe that in this county we not only treat our children worse than our dogs but we write books about it and make money from it. Love should NEVER hurt. We have made it illegal to beat our spouses but condone the same abuse on human beings that are so much smaller and have no alternatives. Maybe one day in this country children will be recognized as people and not pets, or belongings."
1,stop the whipping!,"To even want to whip a child as young as 15 months, is just awful to me. To whip the child until he is in complete submission as mentioned in the book, sounds like breaking this poor child's spirit to me. I think it's sad that we feel that we have to whip our children in order to bring them into obedience. God doesn't whip us does He?? I have heard the arguments about how it's to be done in love and so forth, but coming from a position of trying Dr.Dobson's method on my son (mildly), I found that my son was getting very aggresive...this from a boy who is the most loving kid I have ever seen. We stopped the spanking immediately! He now gets time outs and it works well. One and a half minutes in a corner for being one and a half years old.Let's love our children and stop the abuse"
1,Proceed with care,"Dobson writes in a convincing way, mixing truths with falsehoods. After I read ""Dare to Discipline"" I promply got rid of it and ordered ""Without Spanking or Spoiling."" Dobson teaches parents to use corporal punishment (whipping and spanking of children as young as 15 months old) to correct what he calls defiant behavior. This disturbing advice is a sure recipe for creating an anxious or even a depressed child. Parents should run from this book which claims to be for Christians, yet contains not one quote from the teachings of Jesus Christ. I have raised seven wonderful children and had no need to strike them or dominate them with fear and pain. Seeking parents should look elsewhere for good parenting instruction. Stay away from any book tells you have to whip, hit or spank a child in order to guide them to become self-disciplined adults. It simply isn't true."
2,A Little Alarming!!,"While I am in complete agreement with the basic thesis that there is not enough discipline of children today, and feel that there may in extreme circumstrances be the occasional need for spanking, I was alarmed by this book. He speaks lovingly of having his legs switched by his mother, and though he protests that he does not believe in child abuse, it is difficult to understand where he draws that line. Also, be warned that the author emphasizes Christianity (and occasionally broadens it to the ""judeo-Christian"" heritage)often in the book as seemingly the only belief system that can provide the basis for an effective system of discipline. Non-Christians may find this idea offensive."
1,What's not ok for adults is ok for children?,"Would you behave this way toward a non believing adult? Would you send them away when you didn't like how they addressed you? Would you threaten to hit them or hit them if they had a ""bad attitude""? Of course not! How is it different somehow for children who are even more fragile and voulnerable? It's not! Plan and simple children are people to and they deserve the same amount of respect as adults."
1,A n awful book from the dark ages of child rearing,A book that suggests using something from around the house to hit your child with rather than you hand....this is a very dangerous book. Research is clear that physically punishing children does little good except teach them to fear you. I recommend looking at The Explosive Child if you are having problems with discipline. And maybe looking up the word. Its more about teaching and modeling than punishing and hitting.
5,fantastic book,Fantastic. Fantastic. Every parent should have a copy. It is very balanced and is so full of common sense.For too long the liberals have led the day.True love of our kids involves disciplining them.
1,A Gift to be Given,"This book is in good condition,I read it years ago as my daughter is 45 years old.She and her husband are in the process of adopting a son from Nigeria.I will give the book to my son in law.Thanks Bertha"
3,Great book but...,"I loved the Biblical advice Dr Dobson gives in this timeless book however I'm not sure why he felt the need to awkwardly vouch for animal rights in a book about child rearing!! I thought it was totally out of place!!Also, I found rather than providing tangible advice he was trying too hard to entertain the reader."
1,Not a good book,"This book is not good. It talks about actualy hitting little tiny kids who just learned to walk. Children should be protected from danger. Not put INTO DANGER?? Adults need to understand that children have feelings. How would they like to be whipped with something like a hard piece of wood??? It's better to talk with your child. Show respect and they will respect you. This is the golden rule. I am a good student and nice person, and it's not because I was whipped with something. My parents are good to me, not like Mr. Dobson who thinks us little people are just asking to be hit or something mean like that."
1,Disturbingly ignorant and aggressive,"The New Dare to Discipline by James Dobson is a chillingly narrow minded, and at the same time egocentric, book. The ideas which it endorses, of physically attacking young children, shows a real lack of understanding of the sensitivity and complexity of human beings. The lack of understanding about how to teach children how to behave is extreme. Dobson focuses on using such force on tiny children which would bring him a jail sentence if used on a contemporary. His book is a pedantic presentation of a self indulgent need to always have the upper hand. This book is the antithesis of kindness and understanding. What a shame that such destructive views are set forth as legitimate."
1,Based on faulty opinions not research,"THis book gives horrible advice. The guidelines in this book are based on Dobson's ideas, not any research. HOw dare he say (in Chapter 2) that Dr. Spocks idea were off the wall! Dr. Benjamin Spock's books were based on research and very nurturing to children. Save your money and go for a book by Spock, William Sears, or Brazelton.Jennifer Kuehn"
1,Disgusting,"This is the sick advice from a profoundly damaged, unfeeling person who does not know what a child is, or indeed what a human being is; or is in deep denial about it. If you are a good christian and want to be a good parent, you should not waste your money or a minute of your time heeding such pervert, disturbed and disturbing misconceptions."
1,Absolute garbage,"This is the worst book I've ever read. I only read it out ofcuriosity. The title itself is degrading to children. Dobson hasforgotten what it's like to live. Instead, he wants children to be weighed down with overly protective parents and unnecessary restrictions. I remember as a child going to my first concert. You know what? It was a very dangerous place. Lots of drugs and everything. But I had FUN. Thank God I didn't have parents who would've followed this drivel. Dobson promotes constant spanking and meaningless boundaries that restrict children from any sort of real freedom. Part of being young is being free of responsibility. Having fun is what life in general is all about. For anyone out there craving life and all its splendors, don't read this. Don't risk your children hating you for their restricted and unfun youth. That is all."
1,Was looking for discipline help... this is not it!,"I read this and several other books looking for some help with my 3 year old, who is not a bad child, I just wanted some advice about effective discipline. I could not believe the paragraph where Dr. Dobson describes pinching the muscles in a child's neck to inflict quick pain. My parents did not spank me, I was expected to behave, but encouraged to be creative, empathetic, and stand up for what I believe in. Very anti-Dobson. Guess what, I am a happy well adjusted adult who looks at each day and each new sitaution optimistically. I guess I didn't realize how many people did not grow up like this. I literally called my mom to thank her for not reading this book. She surprised me when she said that she did, but it just went against her instincts as a mother."
1,Dobson's dare to discipline is dare to hate your child!!,"I read Dobson's book, ""Dare to Discipline."" Followed his advice ONCE. After spanking my 2 year old for what I thought was ""defiance"", my son looked at my with such hurt in his eyes that I threw his book out in the trash. I NEVER did that again and my son is now 15, a straight A student, and a very decent loving boy! I, however, am still haunted by that look and how I hurt him that day. Don't buy this book, it is TRASH!"
2,An Alternative: Families where Grace is in Place,"Having been raised by parents who strongly believed in creating a Dare to Discipline environment, I can only say it was refreshing to read an alternative (dare I say ""more Christian""! ) approach to raising children. For those who want to read a kinder, gentler, yet just as effective view, read ""Families where Grace is in Place"" by Jeff VanVonderen."
5,"great book, give it a chance","This book contains great principles to implement consistency, structure, and order in your home. It does not advocate child abuse in any way; in fact, Dr. Dobson specifically explains the difference between child abuse and discipline. From problems with school work to tantrums to questions about sex, this book covers a variety of practical topics in a candid way. Although the majority of the book is geared for use with kids under the age of 10, there are sections regarding teenagers. The book is not really about spanking, it's about raising your child according to Biblical principles. If you are against spanking, you could substitute the word 'time out' and it would still be an effective book to use in your home. It will especially help parents who feel overwhelmed by their young children."
1,"Spank and Pray, Spank and Pray","My neighbor gave me a copy of this book when my kids were small, and I was APPALLED.Dobson's entire philosophy could be boiled down to this: spank and pray, spank and pray. Is the praying supposed to assuage one's guilt over what is essentially bullying a small child?I was also very disturbed by his many allusions to incest and began to find Dobson's obsession with that subject positively creepy.Look anywhere else but here for advice if you're a parent. This book is evil."
4,Dare to Discipline is a must,"I have raised three children and they were all very different. This book gives the parent the tools to deal with all types of children. My oldest daughter is a lawyer, my second oldest a nurse, and my youngest ( a son) is still in high school. They were all treated fairly and disciplined carefully from an early age. So far they seem to be well adjusted and are useful citizens. This book has had much to do with that. Thanks Dr. Dobson."
5,child rearing for all religions,I must say that you do NOT need to be a believer in Jesus Christ to find this book helpful. It is an example guidline for raising children who are respectful of others and understand the proper way to live in society. It was very encouraging about feeling better about disciplining my child. I loved the way he explains the difference between discipline (reacts to the behavior) and punishment (towards the individual).
1,The advice in this book deeply concerns me,"I had heard so many good things about this book that I am a bit stunned by it's actual content. As a Christian, it concerns me that though he is such a visible Christian in our society, he did not quote Jesus even once. It does lead me to ponder how would Jesus parent, if He was in the room could I follow the advice in this book? For me the answer is no. We do discipline and I suppose we are strict but there are other effective ways to get your point across. As a result, our kids do behave well but more importantly we know them as whole individuals, not just the part that is ""acceptable"" to us. Most importantly we do listen to our intuition and pray and try to listen to God's guidance. There are other Christian books out there that are closer to Jesus' gentle instructive nature that is illustrated in the gospels again and again."
1,Abomination in God's name yet again!!,"Yet another treatise on how to beat a child into submission--in the name of God and citing scriptures to justify abuse. I don't think this ""man"" (and I hesitate to even call him a human being, let alone a 'man') gets the concept that any idiot can beat fear and obedience into someone--it isn't acceptable, moral, LEGAL or Christian to do so and he seems to conveniently avoid that issue entirely. I am sickened and disgusted by his perversity in parenting and his greater perversion of the true doctrine of Christ--love & forgiveness."
1,Damaging,"I have to say I have no time for this book at all. When my children were small, James Dobson's books were all the rage in the church circles I belonged to - by some almost elevated to 'scripture'. This book was supposed to present the 'tough love' of Godly parenting. I remember going to parenting teaching based on this and other of this author's books.Sadly, I implemented it in my family, believing that this kind of harshness was Biblical and beneficial to my children's future. Oh how many times I wish I could press the rewind button and do it all differently!As I look back now, I would have urge other parents to find alternative material, that is more balanced and far less harsh and controlling. For me, as a church leader, I would not allow this material anywhere near the parents in my congregation.I think a more apt title might be 'dare to damage', because certainly that is what happened in my family and others that I know as a result of this kind of teaching."
1,S&M Chistianity,"I read enough of this book to be entirely sickened. Dressing up abuse with religious language does not make it OK. It makes you both a sadist and a bad Christian.And I have to address the weird sado-masochistic vein that runs through the spanking on the butt, total domination and loving to be whipped with mother's girdle. I can't tell you the degree of wrongness I feel in this. Maybe I'm too straight-laced and this is the proper way to give your kids sex ed.[...]I am a mother of a three-year old and have never hit her except a small slap on the wrist when she repeatedly reached toward something dangerous. I never made her cry or dominated her just to show I could. We have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship and she says ""Mommy, I love you in the whole wide world!"" What kind of a psychopath would use a stick on their child? I don't want to know."
1,I'd rate it zero stars if possible,"Dobson, himself an acknowledged victim of child abuse, perpetuates the problem by dressing it up in religion. Without qualifications in pediatrics, child psychology, social work or even theology, he twists and tortures the Bible to justify what can only be described as a severe psychological illness of his own.The techniques he advocates - prolonged spanking, and even shaking - are dangerous, and are documented causes of both severe injury and death.Please, please, do not buy this book, and do not recommend it to your friends. It destroys children."
1,Horrible Scary Advice,"This book is truly awful. This book is for parents who are lazy and don't want to think. A much better book is ""Kid Cooperation"" by Elizabeth Pantley. I strongly believe in discipline but there is a line between discipline and abuse. Dobson's book is pure abuse."
1,The New Dare to Discipline,"Hitting kids has always been a favorite sport for the religious and political right. Intimidating and brutalizing children apparently makes these folks feel authoritative, powerful, important, self-righteous and firmly in control. James Dobson's new book is even more draconian than its predecessor. It's truly frightening! Yet it's important to note that Dobson and his followers do not reflect authentic Christian values. In Jesus' words, these are the false prophets. Dobson takes the thinking of a far-right, almost Fascist, political philosophy and cloaks it in Christian language. Anyone who takes seriously Jesus' Sermon on the Mount will immediately spot the fraudulence of Dobson's counsel. It's inconcivable that Jesus of Nazareth-- compassionate as he was toward the weak and powerless--would ever sanction or participate in violence toward children. I give the book a negative five."
5,Thank You,"Thank You so much Dr. Dobson for a book with advice that works. I am the mother of one child, but I have been a pre-school teacher for many. The books we had to go by in the daycare didn't even begin to build self control in children. I was slapped, kicked and abused by four year olds. Thankfully I can apply your book to my own child and she will become an adult with a happy life, because she will have learned self- discipline."
1,Absolutely Awful!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the worst books I've ever heard about on the topic of discipline. Dobson seems to believe that hitting, using a ""switch"" or ""paddle"" is a good ""parenting tool""! (and yes, spanking IS hitting).One part that just makes me shudder with disbelief is where he insists that if a child cries ""too long"" after getting a spanking (which he warns should not be too gentle), then they are being defiant and should be spanked again (this time for defiantly crying).He is constantly name calling- he refers to children as ""tyrants"" ""rebellious"" ""destructive"" and others. He constantly makes children out as the enemy, that needs to be beaten.Please, do yourself and your child a favor and skip this one. There are a lot of other GREAT parenting books that do not suggest hitting a child."
5,James Dobson shoots straight at the target!,"The original ""Dare to Discipline"" was great for parents, and the new one is even better. Dr. Dobson carefully explains the needs that are most important to kids and their parents. He lays out his belief, complete with scripture references. While it is obvious that child abuse has increased, the need to correctly discipline children has increased even more. James Dobson shows how teaching and training must be loving yet strict enough to sometimes be called old fashioned. This is a must-read for all newlyweds and especially new parents. It is as relevant now as it was when I first read it several years ago."
1,Gave my abusive Mom the excuse she needed to beat the tar out of me my whole life.,"These practices used on an adult are called assault and battery AND are illegal! My mom daily beat the snot out of me and degraded me. Loved to use the muscle pinching technique on me. Well guess who I don't see and who has seen my son only once...my Mom who loves Dr Dobson's Dare to Discipline. Want your kids to hate and fear you their ENTIRE lives, cause they will if you follow this book"
1,The New Dare to Discipline,"The content of this book is appalling. The author has some severe problems from a spiritual and human viewpoint. Just the thought of advocating hitting children with hard objects like ""the Rod"" makes me sick, especially since I was raised in a non-violent home. I feel giving any attention to this book is a complete waste of a human beings time. I strongly to do NOT recommend this book to any parent in any place on this planet."
2,bad but not as bad as I have seen,"I oppose coporal punishment (unless I have been bad and the girl is attractive) so i obviously am not going to give this book a good rating,I will say, though, that Dobson seems to be the more reasonable of the unreasonable. He does not advocate--as does Richard Fugate or Lisa Welchel-harsh corporal punishment for the slightest ""disobediance."" Dobson leaves a little more room for, say, redirecting a toddler, and he also talks about medical reasons behind behavior. He also, at points, talks about giving a kid who is having a bad day a break, and I like that.But I don't like his politics or his methods, or him for that matter. If you do go in for this type of crap, however, this is the least toxic of this type of book."
1,Violence Begets Violence,"Dobson has it wrong. Children's susceptibility to God and the attributes of God has to do with rearing them with the love of God in their hearts from the beginning, praying and relying on God, and being taught to please God. Violence begets violence. To spank and be violent toward children is proof of the perpetrator's ignorance of modern scientific evidence that spanking is detrimental to the emotional, physical and spiritual evolution of children. Ignorance begets ignorance, and if you're in charge of children, feeding your mind with ignorance is no benefit to your child."
1,Violent child rearing begets angry and revengeful children,"As a society, we reap what we sow: Violence begets more violence, as well as a host of other problems. Thirty years of research has consistently found that corporal punishment in all forms increases the risk for anger and aggressiveness in children. Corporal punishment also has been found to increase the risk for many physical, psychological, sexual and social problems, including:Physical injuryEscalation to legally defined physical abuseSexual abusePost Traumatic Stress DisorderDepressive DisorderPoor self esteemSuicidal IdeationJuvenile aggression and violenceSibling violenceDomestic violence in adulthood towards own partner and childrenSadomasochistic paraphilias (fetishes)"
1,A kid says no stars!!!!,"This book is so terrible. I wonder why Amazon even sells it, because it recommends hitting little children, even babies only 18 months old! We children are not defiant spitfires like this book says. Children have feelings and are human beings. If it's not OK to hit an adult it's not OK to hit a little kid. And where can a little kid go to get away from being hit? It's not like we can go out and rent an apartment you know. Maybe adults should just get used to the idea that young people won't always agree with them, and maybe they have good reasons, and should be listened to. Anyway don't buy this book it's not full of Christian kindness."
1,This book made me hate my childhood,"I grew up surrounded by Dobson-ideology; not only did my mother read 'Dare to Discipline' and 'The Strong-Willed Child', she kept them by the paddle in the pantry. I've read the books myself, now that I'm an adult, and see them as psychology-shrouded justifications for violent people to exercise their angst on their smaller, defenseless children. I'm afraid to be a parent. I don't know how to be a good one, and it's mostly due to this book and its dangerously self-righteous author. He doesn't understand how far his sugar-coated words can be carried, or how many people he's unwittingly hurt by way of all those royalty checks. Please, please don't buy this book."
1,I should be sending Dobson my therapy bills,"If you want to render your kids deeply unhappy, confused, and fearful of you and the world, this will do it. ...The application of Dobson's techniques and outlook by unthinking, unreflective adults who sincerely thought they were doing their best for me wrecked my relationship with them, my confidence, and my sense of inner well-being."
1,Is this how Jesus would do it?,"This book is very disturbing. The author clearly doesn't like children. He is so focused on labeling children as selfish, demanding, defiant, bratty, rebels that he forgets to consider respect and love. The bible tells us to 'do to others as you would have them do to you.' I am pretty sure that Jesus didn't go around smacking people in order to train them into submission. Dobson turns parenting into a contest of wills. Dobson's mother once whipped him with a girdle and he says that it made him feel loved. Come on! It is extremely upsetting that this book is even in print, but to think that he makes these statements and then passes them off as God's Instructions makes me very very sad. Consider reading How Would Jesus Raise a Child by Theresa Whitehurst instead. Your children will someday thank you and so will all who come in contact with them."
5,Dare to discipline,"I read this book in the 70's. It gave me great insights. If folks are connerned about the spanking part, if you use his criterion it will be rare. The proof, for me is that I raised 2 very responible, outgoing loving children that are awesome as adults. I get comments about what a great parent I was based on my adult children. Now I am buying copies for them to use with their children, my grandchildren."
4,I Liked It!,"Having read several transcriptions of ""The Shewings of Julian of Norwich"" I have found that this version has been one of the best transcriptions. Georgia Crampton did a very good editing job. I had a few questions on her placement of certain punctuation which led to a little confusion in parts, but overall, the transcription and editing was done wonderfully. The footnotes which explain unknown words are helpful, though they explain several obvious words and don't explain many indecipherable words. This, however, is the only problem that I could find."
3,"Fast read and interesting concept, but a bit over the top","I enjoyed this book, and look forward to reading the rest of the series. It was a fast read based on a feng shui practitioner -- and with feng shui thus interspersed throughout. (Knowing virtually nothing about feng shui, I found that very intriguing.)The mystery/solution seemed hopelessly convoluted and far-fetched, but this was probably the result of it being the author's first book ... I'm sure that the rest of the series will be more believable -- and, as previously stated, the feng shui connection was unique and intriguing."
4,vryvu,"I enjoy these and the carrier series even if they're a little unbelievable now and then. By the way, there is no Keith Douglass, it's just a name the publisher owns. Different people write under that name."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It was dark and depressing, but very satisfying. Yates is an amazing author, and I liked this book even more than Revolutionary Road."
2,Depressing tale,"Reading easter parade puts you in depression, as much as the start is promising and has a great detailing into the character of two sisters.. end is abrupt and sad."
2,Depressing,"Well written, but I couldn't get interested in the characters. Too ""gray"", meaning no ""light"", in the story."
2,Not good literature.,"I liked Yate's novel ""Revolutionary Road"" very much, but found Easter Parade disappointing. Lots happens in a short book, and Yates exhibits the clean, simple prose style of a good crime writer. Looking back, at the end of the novel, I was touched by all the fruitless effort Emily Grimes had put into establishing a satisfying long term relationship, only to be thwarted by the limitations of the men in her life. Yet Yates is really writing about people, not making them come alive as well developed characters. When Emily turns her back on her sister, which should be a major event, it is almost casually dismissed. ""The Easter Parade"" is readable, but it is not good literature."
1,Great Premise But A Disappointing Result,"Richard Yates is one of those authors who seem to have fallen off the radar screen. In fact, I only came to this book because it was a selection of one of my online book clubs. While family dysfunction has proven the grist for many a great book, this is not one of them. The main problem is simple: the author doesn't seem to have any interest in or -- perhaps even worse -- any real talent for exploring the inner lives of his characters. This is particularly troublesome here because Yates chooses to focus on the lives of two sisters. This is not to say that male authors cannot succeed in plumbing the psyches of female characters (Ian McEwan's astounding ""Atonement"" springs to mind), but Yates' refusal to go beyond the surface results in an uncomfortable -- almost prurient -- focus on their sex lives. About the only positive thing I can say about The Easter Parade is that -- given the spareness of Yates' prose -- it reads quite quickly."
3,So sad I forgot to cry...,"One of the saddest things to witness is the gradual evanescence of a writer's reputation and stature. I'm afraid that Richard Yates is destined for a short ride to oblivion with brief pit stops at various Used Book shelves along the way. The reason? Time has the same effect on melodrama as it does on nubile women. The author's chracters inhabit a world where there's no place to go when the bars close and nobody really loves anyone, really. This brand of sentiment may work wonders with undergraduates their first semester away from home, but most of us have grown up a bit since then, haven't we? ... Earth receive an honored guest, Richard Yates is laid to rest."
5,This is the other book by Yates that everyone should read.,"The Easter Parade is almost as good as Revolutionary Road. It is almost as grim as RR, but there is a ray of hope at the end. I highly recommend this book and I would urge everyone to read everything by Yates that they can get they can get their hands on. I would also recomend that the reader go to Stewart O'Nan.com and read his essay ""The Lost World of Richard Yates."""
4,The Easter Parade,"""The Easter Parade"" may be the best book you've never heard of before. It's a novel about the Grimes sisters and the way their parents' divorce hangs over their unhappy lives. Richard Yates was a writer who could pick the perfect detail and show us lives in all their disappointment."
4,Well written novel,"I was so lucky to find this book at a library book sale recently. I was not familiar with Yates' work prior to this, and now I'm reading ""Revolutionary Road."" Unfortunately Yates lived so unhappily in his final years. His writing, on the surface, seems simple and uncomplicated, but before you know it you are engrossed in his settings and characters."
4,Like the versitility,"I had been without a Nesco roaster for 15 years, must say I was skeptical when my new one arrived. The materials used now are much lighter weight and I was concerned. After my first use the concerns were dispelled. I was very happy with the results of slow roasting a ham for my son's wedding."
4,Psalter for the Christian People,"For those wary of inclusive-language Biblical translations which might be too extreme, this psalter presents a modest but appreciable freshening of patriarchal language. Very close to the Book of Common Prayer (Episcopal Church, 1979) psalter, it is especially useful for worshiping communities in that denomination but could be used in public or private prayer in any church (or synagogue--the book's title is unnecesarily limiting; there are no direct Christological references in the book itself). The concise introduction (2 pages!) explains in ten clear points the criteria for the language selected and includes examples. A bonus is a short essay, also with examples, on singing the psalter. The handsome design by noted liturgical artist, Frank Kacmarcik, Obl.S.B., makes the paperbound volume worthy of use in places of public worship."
2,Too big for the size,"I bought it for myself, I use small and I order it as small and it said small on the tag but it was way to large, I had to return it."
3,Wheatherproof But Fit is not good.,"I have been using these pants for the past two months. I have a 40 mi daily commute in and out of NYC. These pants are definitely waterproof and warm and are easy to wear over pants/jeans (I did go a size up). Yes you do have to remove shoes which is not a big deal.The issue I have with them is that they are very baggy near the hips (especially with the hip pads in place). Also the crotch length is ridiculously long and while riding the pants ride up and expose ankles. You would need full length boots.Anyways all in all very functional, economical and definitely worth 3 stars.Just wish they made it fit better."
4,Good Pants but.....,"Received these just in time for the cold weather. The first time I put them on the little (and I mean little) holding straps for the inner lining ripped off! Both of them. The sewing of these holding straps were poorly done. I did contact the seller of these and they contacted me right back. They offered to replace them for me. But, I needed to use these as I ride to work every day. So I fixed the straps myself with a needle and thread. I feel they need to fix this issue with better attachment. They are very warm and most definitely order a size larger to fit over your pants. Must take off your boots to put on and off though. It could use a elastic strap to put under your boot to keep the pants from riding up on your leg while riding though. I might add this myself someday. All in all a good pant for the price."
4,Pants,"These pants are nice and very warm. The only flaw is the winter insert should have been more sturdy. I broke one of the retainer bands just trying to get my foot out (my shoes were off). :o( Other than that seems to be good quality. Not to restrictive, and comfortable while riding my Bike."
2,Returned the product___you get what you pay for,"I returned the pants for two reasons 1) they were too big 2) the pants need a zipper on the side. First, ordering the pants a size larger than what you wear is not the way to go; they were too big. Also, the pants did not have a zipper on the side, so you will need to take off your shoes to get the pants off. This is a big pain in the you-know-what.However, I sent them back and Jaffrum promptly refunded my credit card. I would order from this company again"
4,Nice stuff,"I like it good quality, worm and safety. This what I am looking for. The only negative point is pockets not easy to use."
5,"One Word, Two Words, Hyphenated?","I edit, rewrite, transcribe and type books for writers of all genre. I have spent many hours verifying if a word should be...one word, two words, or hyphenated. I read a review of this book and said, aha, this is for me. Amazon had to find it for me as it was out of print. This book should be called a ""Writer's Bible"" and I use it often."
4,-I Have Three Of These-,"I'm amazed how often I use this book. I have one in the office, one in my nightstand and one in my bathroom by the toilet. I don't know what I would do without it. It's not complete by any means, but it is always a good place to start."
4,Helpful book for courtreporting,I was a court reporting student when I bought this book and it really helps out in the transcription room. It could make the differenct between a pass and a fail.
1,Worst experience ever,"Was not pleased with experience at all. Waited three weeks to receive product, contacted the seller, he said Amazon insisted the order didn't exist and they never shipped my payment to him. Contacted Amazon, and they sent me an email saying to contact the seller again. After I emailed Amazon a second time, they agreed to refund my money. Wasted a lot of my valuable time! Will not shop here again."
5,Miller and Mirabal explore their traditional roots,"Robert Mirabal's solo music tends toward new age, and Bill Miller's toward contemporary folk and rock, but here, both put aside the embellishments to create truly Native American medleys of drums, pow wow chanting, and dark flute duos - with little hint of modern instrumentation. The first half of ""Embrace and Betrayal,"" which has a wonderful voodoo feel about it, is the highlight for me. Contemporary Native American music at its best; I have nothing else quite like it in my collection."
3,Needs to more native.,"I believe in one of your songs ""Praises"" I like it because of the drum beat. I would love to hear more songs that sound like your at a pow wow."
1,Box set incorrectly packed,"Midsomer Murders, Set 19I just received this set only to find that I have 2 copies of Blood on the Saddle and 0 copies of The Sword of Guillaume. Of course, I have no way of contacting customer service directly to advise them of the problem. I don't know if I returned the order for a replacement if it would be a proper set or not. I am really very upset about this!"
3,The corpses pile up high.,"I've been watching the series for a while now, the bests parts are: good acting and scrumptious English country settings. However you must suspend reality to believe that the British countryside has a murder rate 100 times per cap. higher than New Orleans or Detroit! The often grizzly murders move the plot, you can count on 3 to 4 death per episode. And here lies the rub, in order to explain why the the sedate conservative residents become killers the writer builds up reasondat based on shaky foundations. There is just not enough motivation for most of the characters to commit the ultimate sin. On the other hand there are tons of red herrings and plot twists to bamboozle even the hard core mystery buffs. In the end, while you may get entertained you may not necessarily get nourished."
3,Enjoyable BUT...,"This is definitely an enjoyable series with great writing and good performances. However, I'd like to point out a few things on the down side; 1- the murders are extremely grizzly with lots of blood and mutilated corpses at every episode, which is in sharp contrast to the supposedly peaceful villages where they occurred. 2 - The motives that caused the villagers to murder are very trivial and petty most of the time. 3 - The murderers are the most unlikely people; people who have lived clean and decent lives in a nice peaceful village suddenly go berserk for some petty reason and start butchering their neighbors.So obviously the writers achieve their goal - it's just about impossible to guess who done it, but it made me feel let down in the end of every episode.Anyway, like I said - it is an enjoyable show never the less, just take off your thinking cap and enjoy the blood fest..."
3,closed captioning on Midsomer Murders,"I purchased the first 3 volumes of Midsomer Murders several years ago,and they were not captioned. Some $154.00 worth. I too need closed captioning, but if the subtitles, or closed captioning is not specifically stated as a yes, then I will not purchase. These were from Alcorn as well."
5,Good British Mystery,We chose this book because we loove the Midsomer Murders. We are colliecting then as we cn afford them. This maked our collection one step closer to completion. My husband watches them over and over and enjoys then as much on the repeat viewings as the first time.
2,Not a fitting end to a great series,"Having viewed the entire series (including Midsomer Murders, set #19), I can tell you that #19 is a poor ending to a great series. The content is mainly contextual, 60 min of material unrelated to the real plot. The plot development is weak, truly the weakest of the entire series. The episode with an pseudo-American Old West theme is ludicrous and must have been written and produced on some ""high."" Goofy, is the only word to characterize this final box set of 4 episodes with the ""old"" characters. What a way for these folks to end their otherwise flawless run."
4,The essence of Egypt,"Musicians of the Nile, thats exactly what they are. Their music can be heard beside the Nile in Luxor, as can the music of many other street performers throughout Egypt. This is about as raw and authentic as Egyptian music can get. The sound quality is very rough, but instead of devaluating the sound it only adds richness and reality. This music really is a holiday for the senses."
5,Looking for something different?,"This album is as enjoyable as it is offbeat--from beginning to end. The songs mostly deal with the collision/collusion of a corn-ponish (is that a word?) country and western swing sensibility with a more refined cosmopolitan jazz band and pop music attitude. The results are incredibly clever, often hysterical, songs that read like vignettes of American culture clash. From the sepulchral western swing tones of Zeke Manners and His Swing Billies' ""Mr. Ghost Goes To Town"" (you gotta hear this!) to the wonderfully politically barely-correct more urbane Dorothy Shay (featured on 10 of the 25 tracks), there's a surprise at every turn here. Hell, even Arthur Godfrey and Dinah Shore deliver the goods. A wonderful album that's held together by an inventive spirit and a rather unique theme."
3,"Cute, But Don't Be Fooled","This is basically a cute little stocking stuffer. It's a little more than 5 inches in length. It's advertised as 7 inches, but beware -- it's really the size of a Christmas ornament. On the upside, it is cute and soft and appears to be well made. Just don't expect this doll to be something a small child can ""hold"" in her arms. It's not big enough for that. I was very dissappointed."
5,A fun historical book for kids,"All of Turkle's Obadiah books are great for 6-10 year olds. Rachel and Obadiah, in particular is entertaining because it draws the reader into a historical time and place which might otherwise be boring to kids of that age. The story of the competition between Rachel and Obadiah to bring the news of the approaching ships is a theme that kids and adults alike will understand and enjoy. Turkle's Obadiah books bring life and fun to the streets of colonial Nantucket and to its seafaring and Puritan cultures. I loved it as a child and I still do."
4,Diego's African Safari,"Toy is sturdy and can be assembled in many different ways, very stimulating for the imagination. Check carefully though, mine had one part missing, the front of the jeep. Little ones can get a bit frustrated if they can't get the pieces to click together, so I'd suggest it's a good plaything for adults to get involved."
4,Good for block lovers and Diego lovers,"I've had good luck with all mega block sets we've had, and this is no exception. My son enjoys playing with it. Hoping it does not get recalled like so many other Dora/Diego related items we've had in the past."
2,What?!? Mono... not stereo,"Okay,Sorry for the low rating but i didn't see the word mono anywhere and if you look closely in the black strip portion of the front cover of the cd, it say mono in small letters.If you are a steroe fanatic like me... purchase Vee's collection on BSO label, it's a little more but worth it!Larry GuidryNew Orleans"
3,not as good as his Miami Ice book,"Sadly, this book is more like a bunch of blog entries (although this is from the pre-blog era so more like a running diary). I got tired of the Leyland vs. the media jag. I get it--Leyland doesn't like the media...move on. About the only fascinating thing I took from this was Bobby Bonilla can skate and likes playing roller hockey.Go read Rosenbaum's ""Miami Ice"" (on the NHL's Florida Panthers beginning thru to the '96 Stanley Cup Final run) as that seems better put together. The added bonus is, unlike baseball players, hockey players are not world-class jerks."
3,Behind the scenes in baseball - not always a pretty sight,"Somewhat repetitive but entertaining enough to recommend to the hard core baseball nut. The true Jim Leyland appears (some funny stuff there) and reasons abound why baseball is not as good nowadays (at least for the fan, the players have it ALL). Loved the bit about the grilled cream cheese sandwich - yummy."
4,Lightwn Up,"At first, I read the comments that the Marlin fans had written and I hesitated to buy this book. But it was funny, I'm not going to lie about it. I mean, they don't say this stuff in the morning paper. This is not a suck-up view. This is uncensored, the real stuff. The Moises Alou and the Gregg Zaun bits made me laugh like crazy. Most of the guys aren't nice guys. They don't care about you fans. I just feel sorry that this team broke up. It was a classic World Series, and this book is as in-depth as you're going to get. I reccomend it."
4,Great summary of the Marlin's rise (and fall) in 1997.,Very entertaining sports book. I did not realize what jerks the Marlin players were. It is a great behind the scenes look at the 1997 when the Marlins essentially bought the World Series. Now that the team has been virtually dismantled it is interesting to read about the team that was...
5,Hilarious and you will be unable to put it down.,The first time I read this book it was mad funny. The second time it was 5 times as funny as mad funny. I was unable to put it down. You probably won't either!
5,"an idiot savant, statistical viewpoint","The authors give an excellent review of how matters stood in 2004, regarding text mining. The approach of the book is to minimise linguistic and semantic analysis. Instead, it looks more at the statistics of words (tokens) in documents. By using various such methods, they offer an automated way to classify documents. When this works, it can be a tremendous saver of manual effort. Think of the book as perhaps advocating an idiot savant vantage, and seeing how far one can usefully take this approach.The results of the methods can also be used as input to more advanced and specialised methods, that rely on semantic analysis.The book can also be applied to search engine analysis."
4,Very Good Intro Book,"I wouldn't give it 5 stars, but definitely worth the money. I took an online class at statistics.com that used this as the text. Really a great combination of book and class and wasn't expensive. Highly recommend both to any data miner interested in getting into text mining."
3,Amis crafts a timely story of post cold war social comment.,"Not content to limit himself to his usual playgrounds of lampooning modern English society and exacerbating the battle of the sexes, Amis shows off a scholarly appreciation of the differences, once shrouded by the iron curtain, between conservative and corrupt post-Soviet Russian society and the Western world. In a very readable yarn Amis does all this without bogging down in heavy moralization. The story of the romance between a bookish British professor of Russian and a young Russian Poet in the west for the first time is entertaining, sharp, witty, and wise. This is Amis the writer as a mature sophisticate who manages to keep his erudition in check."
3,"entertaining, not involving","A decent novel but nothing spectacular. Amis is (wordily) witty as always, but the conflict here seems contrived and the whole thing runs out of energy near the end. Too much dialogue with the prof's various friends, most of it repetitive. After reading five Amis novels I'm beginning to think his Lucky Jim was a bit of a fluke."
1,Kingsley Amis - in a world of his own,"What does this writer intend exactly? Hollow charcters you would personally boot out of a dinner party, plus linguistically dubious attempts at Russian double talk. An utter bore this book: God! I'm beginning to sound like Sir Kingsley himself."
3,For B-Siders Only.,"OK, the title says it all. At the price it is i'd say go ahead and buy the album. The only incentive is the Non-Album B-side, ""Are You Ready?"". If they maybe put a live version of ""I Hate Everything About You"" on it, then i'd say go for it. Are You Ready is a good song in its own right. So if your a big fan or a collector then go for it, like i say For B-Siders Only."
3,womens health,This book touched on the area of my problem but really didn't give me any new information. I was worth reading but I am glad I didn't pay more for the book. My error as I should have checked it better before purchasing.
4,Book Review,This is a very informative book and helpful in understanding Vulvodynia and/or Vulvar Vestibulitis. I would recommend this book. I found that reading this gave me more knowledge about the disorder.
5,The Vulvodynia Survival Guide,Great book for women to read. It will be of great help in my practice as a menopause clinician. I refer patients to read regarding a healthcare situation and this book will be very helpful and informative for them. It is a great addition to my library.
4,Well-rounded coverage of vulvar pain disorders for the layperson,"I think this book is a good addition to my growing library of vulvodynia books. I actually wish I'd bought it sooner - it covers just about everything that I've found online by multiple web searches. I don't think it offered me much new information as far as causes of vulvar pain disorders (essentially unknown) or treatments, but the authors are definitely advocates of not blaming yourself for your pain and the importance of properly treating it. There's a chapter on ""adaptive sex"" (my term for sex when your vulva is disabled) and relationships that I think is really important for any woman or partner of with vulvar pain."
5,GREAT INFO book,"This book helped me understand what was wrong with me and my body. It has changed my life and hopefully will change other womens. After years of suffering vaginal pain, now I am on the road to recovery. Excellent book."
4,DIG Drip Kit,The product was easy to install and the flow control provided works well. Make sure and use the tip on having HOT water available when making drip line connections. It made it much easier. I had no leaks except at the adapter for the Dripline at the faucet connection.
4,Can't beat it for $.01,"Exposed was OK ... too slick for me.Carved cuts it up.Do yourself a favor, buy it."
4,Standard pellets,"These are the standard pellets for competition and marksmanship with airguns. I used these in high school JROTC. They do their job well and punch a perfect circle in the target like a hole punch. These pelets can be as good as ""hollow points"" on other targets as well because they are flat tipped. These pellets have great stopping power for lower power (<1000fps) .177mm guns. They can still punch holes in wood at 600fps making them ideal for plinking or rodent control."
2,The title should be 'Understanding Fuel Injection',"I have read this book thoroughly. Although it gave me a great understanding of how TPI works, it doesn't address any of the problems you WILL run into when converting your earlier model Chevy, like my 84 ElCamino. The 50 page troubleshooting guide seems to be straight out of the GM manual. The remaining 80 some pages talk about the specific functions of the individual TPI components and their relation to each other: very comprehensive. Just don't expect any help on 'swapping' TPI to your specific vehicle."
1,THIS BOOK DOES NOT LIVE UP TO IT'S TITLE,"This book has very little to do with swapping TPI systems.It is mostly a primer on TPI fuel injection. It totally misses the boat on all the problems of installation and modifications required to swap or add TPI injection to a non TPI engine.For instance There are no reviews or advice on different wiring methods. Nothing much on after market fuel pumps, nothing on cable mods.,nothing on air conditioning compressor/alternator relocation brackets,nothing on converting a mass air flow system to a speed density system. If you are a street rodder or a hot rodder this book will offer you little to nothing in your quest to add TPI to your car.Don't waste your hard earned dollars here."
1,This book is a waste of money for TPI swapping,"If you are looking for guidance on swapping a TPI system this isn't the book for you. It is only a very general overview of the GM TPI systems. It looks like the author trolled through the available GM literature and picked up bits here and there. Most of the information is readily available on the Internet. There is no index, so finding specific topics is difficult. Half the book is devoted to the standard error codes."
2,Some what helpful,This book is good for someone that has no idea of what they are doing. It gives a good list of part numbers and a description of how the system works and then waste the majority of the book on trouble shooting guides that look exactly like the ones in a regular repair manual. I does not give you any of the information one might be looking for when doing a SWAP.
4,For every Christ-follower,"If you're a Christ follower, you know about helping the poor, visiting the sick and those less fortunate than you. This book explores another aspect of emulating Jesus...spiritual warfare.I recommend every Christian read it!"
5,Green Tea Fat Metabolizer,"I love this stuff! I think it really works, we are getting more & more people hooked on it too."
1,Causes Birth Defects!,"There is a warning on the bottle that says it contains a chemical that the state of California believes might cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. There is NO way a few lbs would be worth some sort of birth defects or reproductive harm! I'm not pregnaunt, but would eventually in the future like to have children. Did not even TRY it, so what a waste of money..."
2,I'm not convinced,"Just like most pills and supplements you can buy that claim to burn fat or give you more energy, this product also seems to produce un noticeable effects. I can't claim it has done anything for me at all. I also worry about the traces of lead that were found in this particular pill."
2,Caution. read the label.,There is a warning on the bottle that says it contains a chemical that the state of California believes might cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. As soon as I read that I quit taking these pills. They were good for energy but not worth the risk. I saw no weight loss over several weeks.
3,Tenchu3,"Wanted the Wrath of Heaven Tenchu, Vol. 3 as shown. Got Kureni soundtrack instead mixed up order?"
1,"Flippant, forced, forgettable","Castro seems to work pretty hard at sounding like a real writer. The result is a lot of over-thought poeticisms, overstatements and generalizations for the sake of the book and at the expense of a real look at Rio. Crudely crafted and flippant at times."
5,Love the scent,"my son loves the bubbles and I love the scent! I see another reviewer was concerned about carcinogens, it will affect you if your immune system is down. in this day and age what is pure?"
1,"SLS and other carcinogens, seriously????","I've just been disillusioned... I used Mustela products since my baby was born, no even before, during pregnancy, and all this time I thought they were natural. Yeah right... LOOK AT THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS! It contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate, and 1,4-dioxane.Mustela website provides information about ingredients. They do state that their products contain certain chemicals in small amounts etc. So, on one hand, they are open about it, but on the other hand, they market their products as natural.I am seriously upset by it. I've been using their products exclusively for my baby. I'm not blaming anyone, it is only my fault that I did not look closer. On a different note, the bottle I just received was leaking; however, I would've returned it anyway."
5,Great product!,"My 5 year old has excema and he has had it since birth. Just being in water triggers his excema. For a long time, bathtime was not quite as fun because we couldn't use any bubble bath products. We decided to try this one and it works great. My son has fun in the tub and his skin is not affected by Mustela bubble bath. We are grateful for Mustela!"
2,Disappointed,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this product. It produced very little bubbles, even with lots of product, and it didn't last but a couple of minutes! It smells nice, but not worth the price. I like other Mustella products, but I would not recommend this one."
5,They're just great,"These guys are absolutely fabulous. They got right to work when we took them out of the box and quickly showed their stuff. They have gotten bored with the supplied safe and I've been having to keep them occupied by buying other kinds of locks and safes to keep them occupied, which has been hard because I seem to be misplacing money. I've even lost a credit card or two, now!The wife seems to like them, too. She especially likes the little blond one and keeps talking about how he really has a heart of gold. She also points to the rather fancy Playmobil yacht that I'd only recently noticed (odd that, I don't remember buying that one for the kids) and keeps saying she bets he really knows how to ""treat a woman like the princess she deserves to be treated as"". I'm not sure what that means, exactly, but overall she seems happy, so I'm not complaining. Overall a great toy!"
1,"In addition to the game ideas in the above review, may I also mention","the need for a a Playmobil Big Pen, where youngsters can learn the fun and joy of our now privatized prison system. Statiscally speaking, 1 in a 100 is sure to end up there, maybe more if they take to the Safe Cracker game readily enough. Can't put larceny into little minds too early, I always say.Toy shanks, applicable tatoos, and lots of fellow inmates of varying derangements can be included.How about a PlayMobil Meth Lab?"
2,Order at your own risk,"Has anyone actually received their safe crackers? I ordered mine, only to receive an email letting me know the product was ""backordered,"" and wouldn't be shipping for ""5-10 years."" Dunno, that doesn't feel like you're gonna be getting the best-of-the-best safe crackers. If you have other connections, I'd pursue 'em."
1,Does not work,"It crushes the cereal into practically nothing and it is so hard to turn I can barely do it, never mind letting my kids try to do it.What a waste of money."
5,Do-it-yourself...,"Love it! Bought it for my 3-year old who is in the ""I want to do it myself"" stage. Put her two favorite cereals in the dispenser and now she can get a bowl, fill it with cereal and grab a spoon all by herself in the morning. She still has to wait until Mommy pours the milk - but we're working on that!"
4,Interesting,"This same skillet model sells on the Oster site for ten dollars less than the price it's sold here, and close to twenty less than what is listed as the list price here. Hhhmmmm."
2,not happy,"For what I gave for this skillet this is a bad buy. Cold spot in the center, does not heat to the temperature on the control. When cooking had bad smell, until I took rubber spacers on lid handle off. 65.00$ is tomuch for this skillet."
2,Charger does not fully charge battery,"This charger is well made and charges the battery to 4.1 volts, even though the label on the charger indicates: Output 4.2-8.4 V 700mAh. Other brands charges batteries to 4.2 volts. At 4.1 volts, the battery is not fully charged and runs out much sooner The camera shuts down at 3.7 volts, so at 4.1 volts the battery is only 75% charged."
4,Heartwarming,Factual information about Canada Geese has been nicely woven into this heartwarming tale of a father and son who rescue and care for an injured Canada Goose and her mate until she is able to fly south for the winter. The illustrations are drenched with the golden glow of autumn and greatly add to the overall appeal of this delightful children's book.
4,Glow Starter,It works great and does what it should. I love that I don't have to worry about charging it. Just change the battery when needed then you re ready to go.
4,Not Bad,I bought this because it was cheap and after dropping the money on the rc truck i figured I would save a little bit on this. I was not disappointed this works very well I have had no problems with its performance at all.
3,As with the first...,"As with TRANSPARENT MUSIC, this CD is a rather uneven mix. There is no question that BJ Cole is a superb and creative pedal steel guitarist, but I have to wonder just what he would do without collaborators like Guy Jackson; Jackson's use of synths does little (on either CD) to actually enhance or expand the music, and on the first CD really adds a trite and sappy ambience. Cole's original compositions are generally enjoyable, though not always to my personal taste, but his searching (perhaps because of Jackson) takes on a somewhat aimless thrust. As with some other artists, BJ Cole may prove a more effective and creative sideman than leader, but without hearing him really stretch on his own, I would suspect it's his choice of people like Jackson that prove a stumbling block. That all said, it is always worth hearing Cole's work. I would still recommend HEART OF THE MOMENT and TRANSPARENT MUSIC for their risk-taking and some really fine moments."
1,Disappointed.,"After reading the previous review I went out and purchased this product. I liked the idea of mesh sides, sturdy base and easy portability. But, when I received it the canopy was too floppy in the open position - so floppy I had to cut it off!. They should have designed it where the whole canopy was removable. If the infant is inside it must be in the closed position. I am also finding trouble finding a properly fitted sheet (it does not come with any sheet) and the mattress is thin."
2,Just not the same qulity...,"This is the second time my husband purchased this exact tool bag. He has barely used this bag and we already need a replacement! The expected delivery date was March 28, 2012 - we thought it was wearing out quickly...Its got a couple of holes in different places,fraying...its barely dirty and has gotten very little use. Tools are almost falling out because of the poor quality. Good size/design - tons of pockets but very cheaply made.The last bag (exact same model) lasted two years of heavy industrial use, out side, wet, oily...His job now is much easier - dry, mostly inside.... but even so the bag is coming apart, so disappointing.Its a great style, but not worth it. I will have to CALL the manufacturer - their website is not working."
3,"Well designed, fairly well made",I'm a electrician using this bag every work day. They last about 2 years which is pretty good-except for the super cheaply made plastic box that goes in the side compartment for little screws etc. My big complaint is that the sides of the bag are not stiff enough so the bag is always falling (or leaning to the side) with the tape measure. I end up putting rods in each corner to stabalize it. The pocket layout is great which is why I stick with it.
4,Excellent value and quality,"I bought this mainly for a drill tote, but it easily holds all of my most frequently used tools and is very compact.A few improvements would make this a 5-star product. A hard plastic panel on the bottom inside of the tote would prevent bits from gouging and penetrating the nylon. Adding four protruding rubber feet would keep the base off the floor and prevent wear. A metal wire stiffener should be added to the handle and top sides to keep the top open for easier access and drill holstering. The shoulder strap should be detachable. And a few more pockets and loops inside and out would be nice."
5,"Nice bag, compact with plenty of pockets.","The size of this bag is what makes it so great. Not too small, not too big. Plenty of space to store all of those tools that you use for small projects.On another note, Amazon sent me one that was missing the little emblem that is embedded in the handle. You can see where it used to be because the glue mark is still there. The CSR was polite and quick to ship out a replacement, but now I have to take time to repackage and send the damaged one back. Wish I could say this was a one time problem, but I've received damaged goods from Amazon before. I'm starting to loose a little faith because it takes time to place calls and send items back.If your looking for a compact bag, I think you'll definitely like this item."
5,Great Mickey watch...Battery info. here,I almost didn't buy this watch because of the Angry Mom review. This was a small gift so I didn't want it to be annoying to the person so I located a battery that works fine with this watch. Whenever you need to replace use the Energizer 379 battery. It works fine and costs $ 3.99 at a CVS near you. :) I hope Ksalber3 reads this.
3,Joanie at her best,I've been waiting to get this album for a long long time.This is one of Joanie's best efforts.She is one of America's best singers and she proves it with this cd.Nobody sings ONE BOY better than Joanie
3,A showcase for an unrealized talent,"Joanie Sommers had a sandy, rich voice that deserved better than she got. This album hints at what could have been. She was the voice of Pepsi (""Now it's Pepsi for those who think young"" and ""You're in the Pepsi generation"") who flashed brightly for several years. Had she used her natural ability to build on her early efforts, she possibly could have become a fine crossover jazz singer with great staying power. As it was, this album, coupled with ""For Those Who Think Young,"" is a showcase for the mismanagement of a short-sighted A&R man out to make a fast buck. The album is worth hearing and even owning, but it will make you wish that Joanie Sommers' unrequited talent had really made it."
4,Cute Toy,My son loves this toy. He started teething at 2.5 months. This toy is the perfect size for him.
4,diamond drill bits,"diamond drill bits, a must have, if you need to drill holes in stone, hard tile or glass.Use lower speeds and keep them lubricated and cool while drilling or they will not last very long."
1,Bad drill bits,"First since the bits don't have a pointed tip, they are difficult to use when you are trying to drill a new hole. The bit slides along the surface. Second, at least the smaller ones are two thin on the end that goes into the chuck. I used one of the thinner bits a couple of times, and it broke in half. They are just too thin."
1,Junk,My first mistake was not buying from a dealer that specializes in equipment for making jewelry. Bits didn't last long when used with plenty of water and proper pressure. The diamond coating was very weak and not bonded very well. I use them now removing dop from holes I drilled with good bits.
3,Typical Renaissance Comedy,"""A New Way to Pay Old Debts"" is a typical Renaissance comedy. The young hero, tellingly named Welborne, has lost his fortune thanks in part to an evil old uncle. Machinations, engagements, and quarrels follow. This is supposedly Massinger's masterpiece, but it has never been a special favorite of mine. I think that Ben Jonson and others pull off similar stories in a more amusing way.I am a fan of the New Mermaid series. I like the commentary and introductions provided. However, the language is more modernized than it is in most editions os such literature, and if you insist on reading the original spelling, another edition is better for you."
2,Long In The Tooth in 2010,"I purchased this used book from a bookseller at Amazon for a very low price although the shipping cost was a bit of a hit. The book was delivered quickly and in mint, ""Like New"" condition. No problems there.The problem however (which is entirely my fault) is that the book was published ten years ago (in 2000). When you are talking about ""online genealogy"", it means much of the book material is now really obsolete in 2010. Even though the book is ""long in the tooth"" there still are a FEW hints for internet surfers who are brand new to online genealogy. Generally however, the book is extremely dated and not of much use to anyone with a little experience researching genealogy on the internet. One example: ""Google Search"" is hardly noted (it's included in a list of a half dozen other search engines and that's it).Probably a good read 10 years ago but it's now ""way over the hill"". I should have checked more carefully before purchasing."
3,Shoe widths are deceiving,"The shoe is well constructed and very nice looking. But the widths are not accurate. I wear an E in this brand and the couple other brands that I frequently purchase as well. The Walden in an E width is not a true E. Initially I thought that i had perhaps just gotten a pair that was mislabeled. I purchased another to compare. The second was same as first. I returned one pair and kept the other in the hopes that I could have them sufficiently stretched. Stretching didn't work and now I'm stuck with the shoe. It is far too narrow to be an E. I have two other recently purchased pair of Allen Edmonds shoes. One required a little stretching as my left foot is wider than the right. The other pair required no stretching at all. So why is the Walden particularly narrow, I have no idea.If you're interested in the shoe, I would strongly recommend going a size up in width. Unfortunately for me, E is the widest in size 6.5."
4,"Great shoe, but fits narrow","I've owned several pairs of Allen Edmonds dress shoes and I've worn a size 10.5 width AA in each. So, I purchased the same size in the Walden, however, the Walden fits much narrower than the other Allen Edmonds shoes I own. After some stretching, I'm able to wear the shoes, but they are not comfortable. I should have sent them back immediately, but figured they just needed to be broken in. These are great looking shoes that will last forever, but they do fit more narrow than other AE shoes."
1,Stiff leather = sore feet.,"My feet are size 12 AA or 12 AAA. I own four pairs of Allen Edmonds shoes and will not buy another pair. I expected softer leather and much more comfortable shoes. The interior strip in the double layer of leather at the heel, right below my Achilles tendon, was exceedingly stiff. When I wore these shoes for about 9 hours, blisters developed immediately above both heels. I have not worn the shoes since then. Classify me as an unhappy customer."
4,Quality Shoe,I have had these shoes for two weeks now. They have a very comfortable feel to them and they are well made.I like the way the leather shines when I polish them. A very classy look.
3,neutral review because of sizing,"First of all. These shoes are beautiful! High quality shoes seem to be a relic of the past and Allen Edmonds is one of the only true American shoemakers that remain. With J&M;'s downgrade in quality and Alden's Beverly Hills price tags, Allen Edmonds is really the only company that remains for me. Everything about these shoes is immaculate, down to the high quality bags that they come with!HOWEVER: These shoes are sized entirely wrong. I'm normally a 12 D/E with ""average"" (*cough* J&M; *cough*) makes, so I ordered a pair of 12Es, they were entirely too small. I switched them for a 12EEE, which are still entirely too small. I went into their store today to find that NONE of their penny loafers fit me. This was extremely disheartening as I can fit into some SLT Ferragamos; an Italian maker should never make wider shoes than an American one. My advice: buy them in the store, and be ready to be disappointed if you have wide feet."
5,A 3rd pair of classic shoes in your wardrobe.,"This pair of shoes is a classic and well invested,the design,build,durability;however, these shoes take some time to break in.Make sure you wear some good socks,and extra cushioning for extra support if you have feet problems.Overall! the shoes are comfortable.I admire allen edmonds brand for the fact they have a lifetime service for the paying customer,depending the situation,and i also like these shoes,and other models are design for every foot type.I highly recommend these shoes to any man who loves penny loafers!!"
5,Johnny Mathis,"Wow. What wonderful music. Doesn't matter what age you are, his music is for everyone. He doesn't change. What a voice."
2,Sleepy Sony on Mathis,"This is one most unuseful hit collection on Mathis: what a loss of time. Only three out the ten tracks in this album are not in original albums currently issued in CDs that you can buy exactly here at Amazon. So, browse back to the original CDs, buy the 4 following CDs and you'll be much happier (I guaranty): ""Johnny's Greatest Hits"", ""Johnny/Deniece Williams"", ""I'll Buy You a Star"", and ""Open Fire Two Guitars""."
5,The Plan Works!,"The Plan is a guide that focuses on a defining a unique path of life that allows for personal growth and yet lets those around you grow within their own uniqueness. This book offers hope in the form of doable solutions adaptable to enrich one's presence on this planet and to overcome issues in daily life looking to defeat you. The Plan should be on everyone's nightstand to encouraging one to go forth with an infusion of peace and hope from its eloquently done prose, poetry and illustrations."
2,"do the job....sometimes, but cheap","I've had these knives for about 4 months. They can cut well for how cheap they are, but I snapped the handle trying to cut through pepperjack cheese. The metal part of the blade does not go far enough through the handles. Not a quality product by any means, but they are good if you need a cheap set of knives. They work for my college dorm kitchen."
4,Nice but not for me,This set is nice. I only have one complaint. I thought each knife is suppose to have its own place and on some of the knives I didnt know where to put them. I thought that they would fit perfectly in each slot. Maybe all knife sets are like that. Its not like its effects the performance because they do work good.
3,The rise of PR,"Most parts of this book impressed me, however some parts did not and it often seemed to point ou the obvious. They did a good job distinguishing the different between advertising and PR but using different examples to show how PR is more modern than advertising yet we view the advertising ass classic and somewhat essential. However, sometimes they drag on with exlaining the difference, and use too many example in a row that may throw people off. The thing I liked is that when distinguishing advertising and PR, they try not to show how they are different, but how it is impossible for them to be the same. This led into how nothing can be mass produced without PR."
1,The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR,"The most disappointing book I've read in a very long time. It is a poorly written rant. No argument is created. ""Evidence"" provided to prove their point is not substantial or relevant.They have a solid point which I believe in. But, I've wasted my time and money on this book."
2,So how do we implement this PR?,"The book states over and over that PR is great for brand-building, but never bothers to offer any tips on how to plan or implement a PR campaign. It could have at least given a few pointers on what to include (or not include) in a press release. Or, it could have given some guidance on how to select a PR firm. But, it's an easy read and somewhat entertaining."
3,"Useful message but simplistic, wordy analysis","Al and Laura Ries discuss why PR is more believable and so more effective to build a brand. The role of advertising is to manage the brand once it has been built up by supporting the PR message. Current focus on creativity in advertising is misplaced. This is because although creativity may lead to advertising awards, it rarely leads to increased sales. Instead PR is where creativity needs to be applied for appropriately positioning the product in the customers' mind. PR is more believable by the customer because it reflects opinions and views of third parties. This believability more than outweighs the loss of control in having third parties provide public opinions on your product and results in higher sales.The book gets three stars because the supporting arguments are simplistic, and the authors belabor the above points for ~300 pages. Also, there is no discussion on the evolving blogs and how they can be used to execute PR effectively."
4,"Advertisers beware, PR is out to get you","What a breath of fresh air! Too often I see ""Marketing Cconsultants"" recommend that their client must ""Advertise!"" Why? To achieve key marketing/communication objectives for the client? Nah. Fat commission from recurring revenue comes to mind. I feel physically ill each time a client mentions they want to advertise or that a consultant recommended that they do so. Sigh.The Ries' delineate the roles of advertising PR in clear and entertaining way. Many practitioners likely take issue with their elevation of PR to top dog. Such an attitude makes it all that easier for their competitors, and likely leaves them wondering why their advertising heavy promotion mix isn't spawning results. Read this book to get a clue."
2,"Redundant, redundant,reduntant...","This would have made an excellent article. As a book, it's a rip-off. I kept waiting for ""the good part,"" which for me would have been the author's ideas on effective P.R. He convinced me of his basic premise, that advertising is a waste for establishing a brand. He did not tell me how to effectively use P.R. to do that."
1,Self PR at its best,"This was a feeble attempt to draw attention to the authors rather than some of the truly critical and substantive issues related to this dynamic era in the history of advertising and integrated brand promotion.This is a poorly argued premise with a self-promotion agenda. While the authors provide a few case histories of brands that have succeeded by relying on the (unpredictable direction) of the PR process, there are literally hundreds of examples that contradict their premise. Save your money, read the other books that show on the list when you search for this book"
3,"Interesting, Not convincing","Al Ries has written some of the basic texts of marketing wisdom. While this book contains some interesting facts and is useful as a reference for those marketers that may want to have some facts at their fingertips for making tactical decisions or to use in presentation to management, the argument is not convincing. First and foremost, every good marketer knows that advertising is only part of the mix, as is P.R. And, a good marketing communications ""buy"" includes direct, out of home, sales support, point of sale, etc. etc. Further, you can't buy PR. Journalists are justifiably aware of product pitches and know a good story when they see one. When Ries suggests that getting PR is as simple as buying advertising he falls down in his argument. Buy the book if you need the facts. This is not a brilliant marketing text."
2,A sales pitch masquerading as a book,"Interesting, yes; convincing? Hardly. You will not be surprised to learn that the Ries are in the business of PR, and this book is nothing more than an extended sales pitch to prosepctive customers.There are still plenty of good examples out there on the efficacy of good advertising campaigns. Consider the single bet-the-company ad that turned Monster.com from a near-bankrupt entity into a profitible enterprise. Or Apple's original Mac ad.Advertising, like any other business, has its share of trends and fads, and right now the big fad is PR-based advertising. This, too, will pass, and we won't have to read books like this one."
4,Put your PR job into perspective,"It's a quick read. The PR industry continues to flounder with regard to defining its purpose and value; this book is a huge step in the right direction.It is, however, only a step. The authors do a wonderful job of pulling the curtain back on the waste of millions of advertising dollars to launch new brands, but did not devote much time to articulating how PR can better handle the job (and at a fraction of the cost).It takes time to change opinions, so maybe the near-exclusive focus on the folly of advertising for new brands is appropriate for this book, and the discussion about PR's value can come later. Every PR rep should send a copy of this book to his/her boss or clients' CEOs."
1,Not at all practical,"While some of the information is indeed interesting and a fresh look at the communication industry, I can hardly believe that the authors find themseves with work.One example: They were contacted by the government of Guatamala. Having done some preliminary research, the authors exclaimed that they could not do the job unless the country changed their name to ""Guatamaya"" to clearly identify the historical signifigance of the Mayan tribe. Yes...that is right, they wanted a country to change their name. That is all they came up with, all they were willing to do. This theme comes up numerous times throughout the book as they demand products and companies (and countries) change their names so they can better market themselves.Apparantly, brand equity (and the decency to not confuse consumers) does not factor into the authors' plans."
1,Another Lame book by father and daughter,"wow--talk about an insult to my intelligence. they really should try and research their books, provide footnotes for accountability. i am amazed that these books continue to get published. al should have quit after positioning.all of the other reviews on this board confirm my belief--you will learn NOTHING from this 2 pound business card/brochure for their PR services."
4,Not a how-to on PR campaigns,"I think some people are looking for this book to be things it's not. It's NOT a how-to on PR campaigns. It's NOT a book about media pitching. It's NOT a book for those who are looking for direct comparisons to their clients. It IS a book for those who enjoy PR theory and national case studies. It was a quick read, and I enjoyed every page of it. Most advertising execs might find it hard to swallow. But definitely worth the time and dollars."
2,Not Very Interesting,"Some of it is true... PR's wax and advertising's wane. But there's not enough insight, strategic or tactical information to make this book a valuable tool for anyone who accepts the hypothesis and now wants to know what to do about it."
2,Good concept ...but,"Interesting as a concept; however, the unreasonably ""passionate"" attack on advertising, using fragile -easy to reverse- arguments, makes you doubt about its credibility.This very subject, approached, explored, and presented in a different way, could have resulted in a great book."
4,Procative? I'll say!,"This highly readable, insightful book should be mandatory reading for anyone involved in deciding where any company's marketing bucks are spent. The authors speak some serious truths about advertising and how it is misused and overused and about public relations and how it is under-used. Of course, as a former PR consultant, I perhaps am biased. However, the numerous examples the Reises cite are hard to argue with. Ignore this book at your own peril."
4,PR's Where It's At,"Ries talks about how important PR is, how it's more important than advertising because PR's got credibility. Discusses campaigns, but not as much on tactics small companies can use. For that, Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired can give you lots of useful advice. Ries's Fall of Advertising is a good read, but it's a bit weak on good ideas if you don't have much money."
1,Talk about a new business ploy,"I work in advertising and I can honestly say I've always been open to the other ""arms"" of marketing, including the power of PR, so I was very open to hearing what Mr. Ries and Co. had to say. However, as I read this I couldn't help but laugh at the obvious animosity towards advertising and advertiisng agencies in general. The book is chalk full of half-baked case studies that just scratch the surface of a brand's marketing history. What's more, the book feels like it is jumping on the recent bandwagon of the advertising-bashing we've recenlty seen in a slumping economy thanks in part to ill-informed journalists. I stopped reading this book half way through as it become obvious this was a new business ploy for Ries' company and not an objective nor an informative read on what PR can specifically do to help grow a brand. Save your hard earned money and buy a real book on public relations."
2,"The Rise of ""PR"" Spin","Regardless of the fact that the Ries' recently opened their own PR firm, and are ""marketing"" it through the regular channels (including advertising venues), the book does offer a PR perspective, albeit an alternative view of what can be accomplished in brand introduction. However, the majority of Integrated Marketing Communication campaigns adequately do the same and even more. Securing space in newspapers (the standard PR vocation), and attempting to get something for ""free"" still drives the PR industry. The demise of advertising is highly premature ($249.2 billion in 2003). The business of America Mr. Ries is still business. The ""spin"" remains too thin and lacks legitimate credibility. IMC....That's where we're going."
5,"Really, really helpful!","The previous two reviews cover the detail...I will only add to them. I've looked through several XSLT books at length, and this one is by far the best. One of the aspects I like about the book is that it uses the same XML document throught. Various XSLT Transforms are preformed on the document and they systematically build in complexity and scope of features. The transforms start out very simple and progress at a comfortable pace. I'm very happy with it. Steven Holzner has become one of my favorite authors overnight."
4,Good to start with..,"This is a good book to start with but definitely not the ""all in one"" XSLT book.I would suggest to start XSLT with this book and then read ""Learning XSLT"" as well as ""XSLT cookbook"".That combination would make you an expert in a couple of days.This book follows the example of planets.xml and uses it consistently, but the example gets boring after a while."
3,lacks real examples,"The theoretical part is quite clear and easy to follow. However, the examples are rather simplistic. What I would like are some examples that face a real life problem and combines the different parts of xslt into one solution."
5,RUSH OUT AND GET THIS,I CAN'T BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE HAVE MISSED OUT ON THIS CD. I GRAB UP HIS CD'S THE FIRST DAY THEY COME OUT. I ALSO CAN'T BELIEVE THE CRITICS ARE SO STUPID ABOUT THIS ONE. ANYONE WHO LIKES ROD WILL LOVE THIS. A TRUE FAN.
4,Rod Rocks,"A Spanner In The Works remains one of Rod Stewart's most dynamic albums of all time. Although it didn't sell as well, I found it to be the return to his roots in classic rock on songs like The Downtown Lights, and Leave Virginia Alone. This is one spectacular album. I think that any Rod Stewart fan will love this record."
4,Too much fun!!!,"I bought this game for my 5 year old. She loves it. She keeps screaming ""Cooking Mama"". I've played and it is really fun. It is a game that you use the stylus ALOT. Highly recommend it!"
4,Loveed the game! Soo fun!,This game is really fun for all ages. I enjoy it very much and it's fun to challenge people and play it whenever!
4,Great cooking game!,"This game is so much fun! I bought it for my 10 year old niece and she absolutely loves it. It teaches how to cut, dice and much more but on a game level. I too even had a blast playing it."
5,Love it,The grandkids love this game. Played for hours. Thoroughly enjoyed watching them play for hours. They were totally thrilled and happy with Granny!
5,cooking mama,"Great game for young kids and very enjoyable for older adults, the game played well and was in great condition"
4,Different but fun,"It is a fun and interesting game, but some of the techniques with the stylus where a little hard to master. Practice makes perfect. To me, it is worth a try."
2,Cute Idea...Poor Execution,"I thought that cooking on my DS was going to be great. And it was for...the first 10 minutes. There just aren't enough variations to keep you interested for long. Chopping onion and cutting up potato is the exact same motion...Just like measuring rice and measuring water is the same. There weren't that many different dishes to make. So if you can already cook...stay in the kitchen. If you have no idea how to cook and are afraid to touch raw meat, then maybe you should try this before attempting the real thing."
1,Disappointed and do not recommend,"I purchased this game based on recommendations from friends and on-site reviews. My 7 year-old daugther has cried on numerous occasions playing this game because the feedback from the game is very negative. It basically makes ""YOU FAILED"" type statements as opposed to ""GOOD TRY - TRY AGAIN."" I have taken this game away from my daughter. I do NOT recommend this game to any child."
3,Only so-so,"This was the only game my wife wanted for Mother's Day. I bought it hoping it would give her hours of entertainment, but we moved on quickly to another game. It was a little boring; however it was a neat use of the touch screen that the DS is famous for."
3,Gets boring,"The first few days I played this,it was fantastic.But after a while,the game started to get a little boring.This game have skills that you need to do great on.After a while,you will start noticing that the skills keep repeating.Now that's when it gets boring.But this is a fun game to play.If you do buy it,play it slowly,or you will get boring as I did."
4,Fun and entertaining,"I bought this game for my DS lite and was expecting it to be a little different. The game itself is a lot of fun. Trying to cook correctly with the touch screen to be perfect like mama. The only drawback is that it is very repetitive. The recipes are all Japanese, so that is neat. Even though I get bored with it, I continue to play to beat my previous score to get a gold medal on all my recipes."
2,Disappointed,"After all the wonderful reviews, I decided to try Cooking Mama out. It didn't last long; I played it for about five minutes and proceeded to forget about it for a week before trading it it for Yoshi's Island DS.Visually, there's really nothing ""wrong"" with the game; the graphics are great. The controls, though, are clunky and counterintuitive. It seems to take forever to learn how to do some of the techniques, and by the time I practiced enough to learn how to do it for real, I had lost interest and tried to move on to nothing else.But that's the worst part of the game; there is nothing else. The minigames are as dry as the rest of the game, and there's really nothing else to scream about.If you're huge into anime style graphics and games that make heavy use of the stylus, buy this game by all means. Just don't be surprised when it bores the life out of you."
4,Cute cooking game,"In this game you use the DS stylus to perform ""cooking techniques"" and dish up tasty recipes. You can get a gold, medal or bronze for each cooking technique (like mix, break eggs, saute, etc.) and each technique in a recipe affects the final score and gold/silver/bronze for the whole recipe. And, completing basic recipes unlocks new ones! (I was puzzled by instant ramen as a ""recipe"" until I saw it unlocked soba and the whole noodle dish family.)Cute graphics and perky music. You're mostly trying to improve your scores on each recipe to get gold medals, and unlock new recipes. No, you're not saving the world, and there's not really a plot, but I think this a nice relaxing game for $20."
4,Fun... even for older kids!,"Hi, I am 11 yrs old, and my next door neighboor's little sister got a pink nintendo lite. She is 6 yrs old and she recieved it for her birthday. With the nintendo ds lite, she recieved cooking mama. I started to play it, and it was really fun! It is fun to get new recipies and prepare the food. My favorite is making the pizza, and beef stew."
2,Be wary of time limits!,"Who can cook in TEN seconds? NOT ME!Not a bad game or bad idea, very cute graphics and okay design. HOWEVER, in all the reviews I read, I did not see anyone mention the TEN SECOND TIME LIMIT on all activities. Yikes! For a ""gamer"" maybe that is cool, but for the average child, no go. You have to do things in warp speed, or the Mama scolds you while sending firey stink-eye your way, which is also intimidating to little kids. It is not always evident how to perform the tasks, and by the time you are realizing that you are doing it wrong, you are out of time (again!). Why can't this game have cooking without insane arbitrary time limits? Would be really cute if you could remove/reset time limits.I would say, if you are at least over 10 or have a lot of time to practice the exact way the game wants you to cut/stir/pour/ etc. then this game may be cute. But definitely not for the slower or younger set."
4,"Fun, but don't overplay it or it gets boring","This is really fun! You can cook tons of both weird food, and normal food. But I'm warning you, if you play it too much, it can get really boring, really quickly. If you're looking for a fun game for the Nintendo DS, then I suggest buying this game."
4,Become a master cook,"In Cooking Mama you are a Jr.Cook who's teacher is Mama.You must chop,fry,flip,peel,and cut with your stylus.You can practice recipes before cooking them which is good because you don't want to run out of time or do it all wrong and have Mama's eyes blaze red with flames all the time.You are judged by Mama and you get a gold,silver or bronze medel for each recipe complete.You start with 15 recipes with 61 recipes to unlock.You can also master newfound skills like chopping,cutting,flipping,peeling,ect...in the use skills section.Overall Cooking Mama is a good game that is very original and fits perfectly on the DS."
4,Pretty Good,"You have to pick from a choice of about 20 recipes at first, then after you beat a recipe you unlock another one. My 11 year old loved it! I even played once in a while with her. Something about it that isn't very good, is that you beat the whole game in about a few months. And it kind of gets boring after you make the same recipe over and over again. But overall this game was pretty good well worth it..."
3,Fun at first but...,"Once you beaten the game, there's not much else to do but go back and do everything over. It's not much of a challenge after you get the hang of it."
3,Not for Adults,"I've always liked little quarky games like this one but this game gets repetitious very fast. After you cook about 10 dishes you're ready to put the game down. The sound effects are great, the colors and graphics are cute. I haven't played it in about a month and there is no excitment about it that makes me wanna pick it back up. This game would be fun for a 10 year old but for adults...it get boring really fast."
3,"No so much, Mama.","""Cooking Mama"" is overall...OK. It's a little slow and it can ruin your touch screen if you are not careful. I would recommend getting a cover for the touchscreen before you play this game!The music is annoying after an hour of playing but I have learned how to make a few new recipes. Some of the recipes seem a bit off from what I would make in real life but I am tempted to try some of the recipies in my own kitchen some day!I only played the game for about 2 days and then my boyfriend has played it more than me. It's not an exciting game or something that I would recommend to everyone. I was a little disappointed by the game. Don't expect anything spectacular with Cooking Mama! It's a good game to add to your collection and gets you used to the touchscreen."
5,Great game!,My 5 year old daughter got this game for Christmas. She loves it! Can play it easily without a lot of reading.
5,Cooking Mama,Bought this game for my daughter's b-day & I think I play it more than she does! It's an awesome game & we will be buying more!
4,Good game,I still enjoy this game even after owning it for a few years. interactive and new recipes all the time. Would definitely recommend
4,cooking Mamma,bought this for my grandaughter this is her first DS and was easy for her to play and understand great
4,"Very fun, no matter your age","I work at a Japanese restaurant and not only are the recipes in this game very accurate, it's tremendously fun for all of us. Whether it's 30 year old me, my 40 year old boss, or their 10 and 6 year old kids, all of us enjoy it. It's easy enough for the 6 year to do most of it, but hard enough that even I haven't gotten 100s on every single recipe yet. I'd recommend this game whole heartedly."
4,Cooking DS Style!,"I just got this game, and I think it's a good one. In this game your stylus is your do it all kitchen tool. You use it to chop, slice, and dice your way through a tasty variety of recipes. Mama is your judge and she gives you metals depending on how good you did cooking the meal. I like the fact that you can unlock other recipes as you go along, and that there are different modes of play. This game is a good way to challenge your skills with the stylus! It may even give you inspiration to try some of the recipes! I think this game has a good replay value. It is definitely worth the buy!"
5,Cooking Mama,"I love this game, it's so unusual, and very cute. The recipes are like little mini-games and you can do one or two, or large chunks of cooking. You can practice before you cook for points, and can make new recipes while you're cooking, and unlock new ones. The foods are all very unique."
1,Awful,"If you enjoy real games, don't waste your time with this shuvelware. This is a game for""Casual Gamers"" or children."
3,Good for Older Kids,Cooking Mama is a lot of fun but not what I was expecting. I got it for my 11 year old daughter. Her friend has Cooking Mama 2 and they are both addicting to the Mama series. I recently got her the game. She does enjoy this game a lot but I hear her yelling at her DS occasionaly. She has showed me the game and I think it's very cute. Though on some steps it's very frusterating. She really likes it but is already on her 3rd way through because she completed everything. It has very cutesy graphics but the part where Mama's eyes go on fire and she looks like she is going to throttle someone is a bit much. Overall Cooking Mama is a fun game but should only be bought for children 8 and up.
4,Fun Cooking Game,"One of my nine year old triplets got this from Santa. She really likes to cook. She loves this game! Out of all the games they got, the two girls like this one the best! I have even found myself playing it :0)"
3,ok,"i think they should come up with mama exercise,healthy mama weight loss sound goood make a game out of that.they have her already gardening,crafting,cooking, they should do swiming like i said earlyier exercise, what about mama's daycare,mama's building something game. dr mama where she's making the people feel better it don't have to be cooking all the time after a while the kids will want to just eat eat all the time. different things"
2,Thats it?,"It might have to do with the fact that I didn't really get very far into it but slicing onions and flipping steaks wasn't very fun for me. My impression of the game when I was reading the summary was more of a Diner Dash. I played it for two hours, Finished about 10 recipes and decided to sell it. Boring. It might be fun for little kids but I didn't find it challenging at all."
5,Surprise,When i first got this game i wasnt sure what to think about it. But the more i played it the more i was surprised that i actually liked it and couldnt put it down!it can be fun to make all the different types of food and to see how well you do at it and what your score is after each one.
3,Not all its rated to be,I bought this game with my DS but i must admit its my least favourite game so far. I looked for games with relatively good reviews and high ratings but this games is not all that its rated to be. It's very repetative. the only way i would really play this game is if the i played out the other six games i bought and was snowed into my house without an internet connection to order another game. I was disappointed
4,"Fun, relatively easy, but a bit frustrating","This is a pretty darn good game. It's plenty of fun, and there are a lot of recipes to play. I also like the ability to change the recipe while making it. My only complaint is that sometimes certain processes in recipes are very frustrating, for example: circling portions of ingredients to stuff things with. This is pretty difficult to get right 5 or 6 times in a row. I've gotten ""gold medals"" on every recipe except ones that require me to circle certain portions. Other than that though, it's easy to play."
3,Not as bad as I thought it'd be (6 year old girl),"My 6 year old daughter told me about this game because she played it using a friend's DSi. By her description, I thought it'd be boring, but we bought it anyways and I have to say it is not so bad. She likes it and plays with it without getting bored after 1 minute, as I thought it would happen. It is not the most fun either, of course."
5,the first mastermind in cooking....,love love love love love this game i loved it so much i had to learn every recipe with all gold coins. it took me a very long time to do but i finally did it. must buy.
4,Where did THAT come from?,"A great album. Heavy, layered, distorted guitars and a thick bassline cover every track in sonic molasses. The singer has a raw, energetic voice that he uses to its maximum. Tracks like ""Hey Man Nice Shot"", and ""Under"" are screaming testaments to modern rock."
3,Strapping Young Lad minus talent,"After hearing ""hey man, nice shot"" about 40,000 times on the radio I finally had to go get the CD, but unfortunately the rest of it lacks merit. ""Dose"" is good song, so is most of ""take another"" and ""white like that"" is excellent, but the album fails to be effective listening in any way (with those songs being the exception.) Buy City by Strapping Young Lad and see what true power, precision, and musical force is all about."
4,Filter's Best Album,"I'm not exactly sure why anyone would say 'Filter' is an un-genuine rip-off of 'Nine Inch Nails'. Their first album, 'Short Bus', provides listeners with a unique sound that you absolutely will not find on any other record. Although certainly not 'Industrial' (which is what a naive music enthusiast would classify them as), there are obvious cliche's and overtones sewn into the lyrics and guitar riffs; but that's not the point. Every track on this album is a deep look inside a man on the edge. The chord structures, basslines, heavy drum beats, and screaming guitars / vocals are engulfed with emotion. This CD, like all others, isn't for everyone; but if you're going to throw slanderous remarks at Richard Patrick, please include a link to the music *you* write. You get the point."
4,Mainstream rock/metal/industrial hybrid,"With a rhythmic structure that hunts the spaces opened by its explosive guitars, the first Filter album merges metal and rock in a listenable hybrid. Industrial beats in the style of ex-mentors Nine Inch Nails thrust music upon the listener like a breaking wave. Able to use metal techniques of thunder, white noise and diffuse explosion equally well, the band make simple power chord riffs stand out with melodic, indie-rock lost boy vocals. Like most mainstream releases, it has its share of cheese so no one misses the joke, but this release puts a lot in the margins. Interestingly, Filter's name was derived from a reading of Immanuel Kant's description of the ""perceptual filters"" that he saw as a human tool for processing external reality."
4,Nice Shot,"I enjoy this CD. It is fast and furious. I like to listen to it when I want to wake up in the morning or anytime I need a lift. The style of quiet stanzas with loud chorus maybe not be new, but it is still effective. I find myself drawn in by the quieter parts and that gives more exhilaration to the intense parts. It's a bit of a roller coaster. I personally, don't consider this an industrial album as much as it is heavy rock and roll, but that is more opinion than fact. Either way, if you are interested in music that is fun, fast and ferocious, this CD will be interesting to you."
5,One of the best CD's I've ever listened to,This is one of the best Cd's out there and if you buy it you will not be disapointed from it. It combines the hard heavy rock without all the very screaming that you get from some bands.
3,"an okay cd, nothing much more than that though.","I bought this CD cuz I loved Filter's sophomore release ""Title of Record,"" plus the song ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" is catchy. Yes, this album is kinda old, but when Hey Man Nice Shot came out on MTV, i was only 9 or 10 years old, so hell, i didn't get into rock music until maybe 4 or 5 years later. Filter is a great band, but it seems like they didn't really shine until Title or Record came out. Only a few tracks on this CD stand out from the rest, like Hey Man Nice Shot (of course), Dose, Spent, and Gerbil. The rest are just sorta...blah. But hey, at least it's better than most of the crap plaguing the air waves these days. If you really must have this CD, i suggest downloading it online or something, but you might be somewhat disappointed with Short Bus if you buy it (I know I was)."
2,Alike,"This is a fair CD, its only downfall is that all of the songs sound very similar. The biggest track and the only mainstream hit off of this album is of course Hey Man Nice Shot. There are a few underground hits like Dose, Take Another and So Cool. Dose is a screeching metal track, literally, it sounds like there is screeching metal with the guitar riffs and the lyrics talk of why singer Robert Patrick feels like someone should go down on him. There is even a brief ballad called Stuck In Here which is reminiscent of Title of Record, that is slow and tranquil, a charming track amongst screams and hard industrial / rock. Many of the tracks sound like they are from Stabbing Westward (but that is because one of the guitarists in Filter was originally from Stabbing Westward). Another downfall of this CD is that every track starts with silence and tunes up. Filter&#65533;s second release Title of Record is a much more solid and commercially pleasing album."
2,A few good songs but nothing original.,"I absolutely love ""Hey man, nice shot"", and as a matter of fact it's one of my 10 favorite songs of all time. Unfortunately after opening with that song the rest of the disc leaves you hanging, waiting for another song of the like, no such luck. Although coming close to greatness on a couple of tracks, it falls far short of my expectations."
5,....,"I think its pathetic how played out ""hey man, nice shot"" is..it is by far the least compelling track on this album and yet it is touted as the best thing filter did. Every other song on this album is better. And as far as songwriting and singing go- filter in its 2 man lineup on this record (as opposed to the recent release, which is inferior to short bus) is by far, beyond 90% of what trent reznor has put out in his 10 year career. Nine inch nails may spend 5 years in the studio working on endlessly looped noise samples but their great samples do nothing for 3rd grade songwriting, whereas I doubt filter spent less than a quarter of that time writing quality songs AND putting togeather a unique soundscheme."
2,Hmmmm,"Well, this is a pretty good CD. But! There are a couple of things that really detract from it. First is the feel that its all been done before (and not just by NIN). This really makes the whole album seem tired and boring. And, sadly, all the songs sound the same and are not individual from each other. This is a decent album, but its really not worth it because it's quite boring."
2,"damn, dude!","I love Filter and have all their stuff. I will probably always keep Short Bus, but only to study it not to enjoy it. The entire album sounds like a demo disc. Every time I listen to it I get the same feeling and it's one of stagnation. Besides the first track all the songs sound too similar. That can be ok but only in moderation. I feel like I'm being generous by giving it 2 stars."
2,overrated and not consistently great,"I'll admit that this album has a couple shining moments, Hey Man Nice Shot is not one of them though despite its radio time. I feel that Dose is an extremely good song and I'd give this cd a 5 if all of them were as good. However, hardly any others are any good and it keeps getting worse as the cd progresses. The cd can hardly be dubbed industrial in my book, it is mainly alternative metal and reminds me of a weaker version of tool. Another complaint is that the lyrics are not thought out well at all except for the first couple tracks. Stuck In Here is a prime example of bad rhimes and low vocab. along w/ the fact that most songs have little emotion or atmosphere. Listening to this paints no image in my mind of any sort. I'd recommend Gravity Kills,or Stabbing Westward. They are way more inovative and convey a darker, more atmosperic feel"
2,Not very good...,"It's maybe closer to 2 1/2 stars, but I docked it a half point because of something I'll explain in a second. I like ""Title of Record"" much better... there are more good songs, and they aren't so ""white noise""-ish. I would give ""Title..."" 4 stars, rather than the 2 I give this. First off, to the reviewer directly below mine; Maybe Godsmack did rip off the bass riff from ""Hey Man Nice Shot"", but Filter ripped it from Stabbing Westward's ""Ungod"" (or they 'borrowed' it with permission from Stuart Zechman; either way, it isn't Filter's). THAT is the reason I give it 2; I bought this CD for ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" (I should consider myself lucky I got it used), but once I got SW's ""Ungod"" (which is AWESOME, a 5 IMO), it became redundant, and rather pointless to have. Short Bus has a FEW other OK songs, but not enough. And the best one with the awesome riff isn't even really theirs."
4,just plain rock,"This is a CD for people who love just plain hard rock....no sappy love songs and no excuses are made for their harsh vocals...not a fast, punk style of music, just a very intellectual hard rockin' album..good hard stuff"
5,New Album-August 24,"if you guys really loved their first album, then on August 24 go to your local music store and buy Title of Record, their second album...you will not be disappointed...and also for those who are confused...""Hey Man, Nice Shot"" is not about Kurt Cobain..."
4,It is a fairly good album.,"I like this album because singer Richard Patrick tells blairing industrial stronged emotion songs while still having a few mellow songs like ""stuck in here"". I started listening to it after I heard their song ""thanks, bro"" on the X-Files:Songs In The Key Of X album and there ""trip like I do"" on the Spawn soundtrack. They also did a blairing remake of Three Dog Night's ""One"" on the X-Files movie album. It's okay, but not really original."
5,god this is really good.,Don't believe any reviews that say this is a bad CD. The songs rock and so does the singer.
3,For Comparative Purposes,"Listen to this album and Stabbing Westward's UNGOD back to back and hear the similarities. Particularly on ""Hey Man, Nice Shot"" and ""Ungod."" You see, Stabbing Westward started with a guitarist, I forget his name, who would leave after UNGOD and join Filter just in time for SHORT BUS. It appears he took his riffs with him."
3,Short Bus...A Disappointment of sorts,I didn't really expect much from this album and wasn't at all surprised by the end product. This CD made me feel by the end of the CD the 'why bother? purchasing or listening. I can't say that I'll listen to this album again for it didn't appeal to my tastes for a number of reasons; It was hard understanding the lead singer; This CD sounded like a amateur NIN; The music was flat and had a demo feel about the whole tracks.This CD will suit adamnant rock lovers and NIN fans. Really for me giving it a 3/5 is a bit of a give me.
2,Its like a glob of clay...no definate shape,"The main part of the album is the same old screaming and power chords. Like clay, for the most part its formless. I mean, the first five aongs are okay, but after that its just the same old some old. i hope you agreee, filter has seen much better days. And by the way, heyman nice shot isnt that good, okay? Posers...."
5,"Good examples and lively, clear prose","This book presents a nice systematic approach to jdbc. The first section develops a foundation in basic database topics. The next section develops jdbc as an implementation of these foundation themes. Finally the third section develops how jdbc can be implemented on the web.This is a coherent approach to the subject matter. To keep things interesting the early sections present full java rich applications that demo things. Hint: place all files for each chatper in separate folders, make a path to your java compiler, and then remove all opening ""package"" commands in each file. The dependencies of the source code are not clearly given. The best approach is to start with chapter 10 code.This book is essentially a solid and thorough tutorial in jdbc. It does not have an alphabetic list of all the commands of jdbc, but it really is an excellent tutorial."
3,No websites available for some products mentioned,"While I think there is some valuable information regarding herbal and dietary supplements in this book (and I have used passion flower and valerian supplements with success), along with the first reviewer, I am frustrated because some websites mentioned for locating supplements do not exist, nor can the supplements be found by searching on google."
3,Beginner's Guide to Machine Embroidered Landscapes,"I think the techniques and descriptions are good. The author is truly knowledgeable about the subject. Beautiful work. I found the flat color of the pictures somewhat distracting. If you are getting the book to read about the techniques, then it is good. I would love to see the same book updated and bolder color. I don't think the pictures do the work justice."
2,All You Need to Know to Get Started with Machine Embroidery,Fantastic book! Detailed instructions to get you going until your own imagination can take over. All her supplies are easily obtainable and you don't need a complicated embroidery machine to make beautiful pictures. I highly recommend it.
5,So much fun..I feel like I'm a preteen again!!!,"When I decided to purchase the V.3 Tamagotchi, I mainly was buying it for my little brother (11 yrs). After reading about it, I noticed that it is absolutely more fun when you have friends who you can connect with. Unfortunately being 14 years older than him, I don't really know what his friends are like and whether or not they would own this particular toy. I promptly chose to break out the inner child in me and buy one too.I can't tell you all how much fun I have had!! I bring the little guy to work (and of course put him on silent) and have so much fun watching him grow and develop into new characters. I've even found a couple websites where others are really getting ""back"" into them. I am looking forward to having new generations of my tamagotchis and raising up new lines of cute creatures.I totally recommend this for a little extra pleasure in all lives and all ages!"
2,"Good for the maps, I guess...","This game book has a LOT of errors. Examples: saying the armor you wear effects the potions you drink (nonsense). There is a room that you are told you MUST have a spear weapon in order to move a block and proceed. Not only does the spear not work on the block, but you only need jump onto the ledge next to the block to get around it...There are three bosses you are told you should use the Instill chain command which will remove 10% of the bosses hit point if it works. Huh? That doesn't work, not even vaguely (no suprise, thats not the description of Instill, or any other chain command.)the real way to beat these bosses: For Kali and Asura, use your best Human weapon on the arm that is weak (thats the only trick: one arm will be easy to hurt, the rest will be virtually indestructable).For the final boss, let him zap you once with a spell, then pound on him with Raging Ache. He'll go down quick."
3,Alright book,"The author of this book did not know much about Weapons and Armor. He missed All the best Blade types for all the weapons, except Great Axe I think, may be more but I doubt it. Also for Armor the highest piece he listed was Hoplite, which is four Armor classes lower than the actual best Armor. As for Grips he actually writes in the book that the Power Palm is the best Grip for Swords, G.Swords, and Daggers. The Spiral Hilt is the best. He never mentioned anything about the Holy Win, the best weapon in the game, which is aquired by bating the Last Crusader (VERY VERY RARE). But surprisingly besides weapons and Armor, everything else was alright. If you just started out, and are planning to get a Perfect game by getting all the best Weapons and Armor, this book won't help a bit. If you care not about Weapons and Armor, then I suppose this book is great. Only worth buying, depending on your tastes of RPG gaming."
3,EVERYTHING OK,No complaints here. As far as I can tell this is a fairly thorough strategy guide for the Vagrant Story game.
1,Poor detail descrbtion,This book only looks good but with very limited resources about how to defeat the bosses and get the best armor or weapons. I can get a much detailed stragety guide for free online.
5,Verilux full spectrum lights,If you're looking for natural sunlike quality lighting these are the lights for you. I use them in my basement and its almost like being outside in the natural daylight. Really great.
5,A good read,"I grew up with Adventures of Tintin and introduced it to my boys. They love it.The characters are funny, goofy and solve mysteries. It is fun for children to go along with Tintin to all over the world from Tibet to the Americas and learn a little along the way."
3,Smaller than the paperback edition; hard to read,"I chose this 3-in-1 for the cheaper price. When it arrived I found it is actually smaller than the paperback editions and harder to read. I'd say buy the paperback ones.I give this a 3-star: 1 star for the size, 5 for the storyline. Average = 3."
1,Small font,ridiculously small font. The smallest that I have come across in ANY printer matter. Period. You should not be selling these.
4,"Vol. 2, The Adventures of Tintin","Printing and binding quality of the book is good. The images are just like the images of individual Tintin comic books. However, I was a bit suprised to find that the overall printing of the volume is a smaller size than individual stories/books. I have the entire collection as individual stories in french and wanted to buy them in english to share with my daughter. Apon the volume arrival I found that the printing is at least 2-3 inches smaller than the individual book printings making all the cartoons and print smaller. The smaller print size is at a threshold (around 7 or 8 font size) where if you have a hard time reading smaller print, you may want to go with the larger inidividual stories."
3,Text on the small side,Note the smaller size of this collection's books before you buy. Text is rather small so not as easy as read as the A4 size books I've seen around. Cartoon strip size is fine though.
2,a slanted view of Southern poetry,"The editor of THE MADE THING would have us believe that the University of Arkansas is the Mecca of Southern poetry and that a disporportionate number of the South's best poets go through that MFA program. It is clearly a partisan selection, omitting A> R> Ammons, Katherine Byer and George Scarbrough, while including not only unaccomplished poets like Ralph Adamo, but dead ones as well. What the editor was thinking probably has something to do with thorazine, but little to do with poetry. Was it ""poultry"" he had on his mind?"
4,X-Ray vision for TV news,"Whenever I encounter TV news after having read this book, the mechanics and biases behind it appear so obvious.By exposing the guts of a news machine, and insightfully comparing different coverage of the same event, Me and Ted gives you a level of news literacy that lets you appreciate it more. This level of detail -- clearly coming from someone obsessed with his creation -- is amazing and rarely tedious. Combine it with Randall Rothenberg's advertising expose ""Where the Suckers Moon"", for a good start at understanding post-70s America.The one drawback ... But once you get used to filtering it out, Me and Ted becomes a wonderful book."
2,Force Program book,"The invoice states that the book was ""new"". It might have beenunread, but it is not ""new"". The pages are yellowed, and stucktogether at the top for about 1/4 the of the book. The cover wastorn on the front. I am going to keep it because it suits my purpose of having a copy of the book for my personal use, and the price was good."
3,Not really necessary for replacement of intermediate steering shaft,"When I set out to replace the intermediate steering shaft in my 2003 Suburban, I purchased the anti-rotation pin out of an abundance of caution. However, it was not really necessary and I could only insert it all the way into the steering column when the wheels were straight. I needed to turn the wheel to get access to the nut. A bungee cord attached to the steering wheel and the handle on the passenger dash worked perfectly. It is not that expensive, but I could have saved the money and shipping costs."
5,READ THIS BOOK,"Seriously, this was one of THE hottest Blaze books. I loved the three little snippets of the sex scenes (there are other full love scenes), but wished they would have expanded off of those, they were definitely hot."
3,What a chore!,"It would be easier to mix milky spore with sand, then use a fertilizer spreader to disperse the milky spore, but Milky Spore provider says you can't mix it with anything and does not provide logical reason."
2,As much of a pain as any other way.,Just like a big can of insecticide powder. Its a pain and any other way is a pain to put down the Milky Spores. I hope they work and its the 10 years plus before we need to do it again.
1,Haven't re'd yet. Lost package now for 30 days.,Shipper UPS has lost the package 11/30/12 and only the shipper can enter a tracer on it. 1 wk for them to do the tracer and still no package 30 days later.
2,Not the easiest to use,"This tube dispenser sounds like a great idea until you read the packaging and unpacking instructions on the Milky Spore box. As you will find, it is near impossible to avoid the dust related to the Milky Spore product as you are filling this tube. Second, the tube does not work that great even after I reviewed the You Tube video demo. in the end the tube does not hold up to the banging on the ground to get the spore onto the grass. The adjustable opening does not stay in the selected output setting and dirt get into the wholes where the spores come out. Stay away."
4,Did what I expected,"As simple an item that this is, it did exactly what I needed it to do. I was able to dispense accurate amounts of milky spore in a timely fashion over a large area."
3,As Advertised,This product was shipped as advertised. I decided not to use it as it was easier to use a measuring spoon to apply the product.
2,Not worth it.,"We applied this last summer. The weather was very humid and the dispenser continued to clog. After about doing half the yard, the cap came off and needed to be taped on to complete the yard. For the cost I would expect a better product."
5,A little known product with big payback,"This is a great product for dispensing Milky Spore. This is the only product that will eliminate the evil Japanese beetles that eat everything in sight. They do what traps cannot do. After years of trying to reduce the beetle population, I found one that works."
2,"i really wanted to like it, but still prefer the old standard","i hate to use products with unnecessary chemicals, parabens, etc. for myself and my baby, so i really wanted to like this product. it worked fine for us in the winter and spring, but as soon as it got hot and humid outside, i found it just didn't do the job anymore. my daughter gets changed frequently -- she doesn't sit around in a damp diaper -- but i just couldn't get rid of her diaper rashes with this. i think the main issue is that this isn't as thick as desitin and other old standards -- so it doesn't stay in place as well or form as thick of a protective barrier. i didn't see the relief over several days with this product that others can deliver in 1. if you go with the mustela, i suggest making sure your baby is as dry as possible (even toweled off) before applying it."
3,Just Spend The Extra Money,"I bought this because it was cheap, and it is. It works fine but it feels cheap and it has a really cheap tightening system for each pice of the light stands. It works like a quick release on a bike except the plastic feels cheap. So if your really on a tight, tight budget it will work but I suggest you just save a bit more and get something nicer."
4,Great movie for the kids.,"Great animated movie for the kids. My son and daughter loved it and it gives them a feel for the god did for us. I still like the original movie ten commandments better, but this is better for the kids."
4,10 Commandments movie,"This is a fantastic movie that tells the story of Moses being guided by God to lead His people out of Eygpt. The film clearly portrays God and Moses' frustation to the people for not listening and obeying God's word. It's a great movie, well worth seeing again and again.The Ten Commandments"
1,"Awful, Terrible, Horrendous, Pathetic Movie","Please, please do not watch this movie. Rent the Prince of Egypt, the Passion, or Ben Hur, but do not see this extremely pathetic impersonation of Moses. You are going to be disappointed. It is a disgraceful impersonation of Moses. There is no passion. Couldn't even finish watching it. Spare yourself from this grotesquely awful movie. I love Christian movies and movies about the bible. But I hated this one."
5,"BRIGHT VIDEO AND LOUD & CLEAR SOUND, XLNT STORY TOO! PERFECT FOR ELDERLY AND ALL THE FAMILY!","GREAT MOVIE 4 ALL THE FAMILY! THE OLD FOLKS WILL ENJOY IT BECAUSE OF THE EXCELLENT & BRIGHT VIDEO AND GREAT, CLEAR SOUND! MY MOM IS NEARLY 95 YEARS OLD AND SHE HAS ENJOYED THE MOVIE SEVERAL TIMES. MOST MOVIES TODAY DO NOT HAVE THESE DISTINCT QUALITIES WHICH ALLOW THE HEARING AND SEEING IMPAIRED TO ACTUALLY WATCH A MOVIE ALL THE WAY THROUGH, AND ENJOY IT! NO DARK AND BLURRY SCENES & NO LOW QUALITY SOUND. BEN KINGSLEY AND THE REST DID A TERRIFIC JOB ON THIS, AND YES LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWERS STATE, ITS A TRUE STORY FROM THE BIBLE!KELLY K, SCOTTSDALE, AZ."
4,good Bible video for fourth grade students,"I ordered this video for our fourth grade CCD class, as they are spending the year learning about the Old Testament and how the stories and the prophecies are ultimately fulfilled in the New. They watched the video into two classes and it held their attention. This video is a good choice for any elementary age religious education class, especially those that are focusing on the Ten Commandments."
5,linebarrels of iron,Good anime dvd. I frist saw it on Yputube. It is about a boy who use a Linebarrels. he came a long way.
3,Lost Interest After Three Episodes,"Not a bad anime if your into mech series, but I really found myself hating the hero due to his character. This one just left me flat. They stated off with a good idea but it got lost in the hero's attitude. I really didn't like the head of the organization that he ends up working for either. Overall, it's Ok, but left me flat."
1,Not worth the money,"Very little information, accented narration, rather dark film. Frankly, it looks like a homemade production being sold as professional."
5,Adoption guide/not a Genealogy search,"I found Mrs. H. (previous reviewer)and myself at total odds! The book is a guide, above all else, to advise you of the emotional challenge an adoptee searcher, or biological parent will encounter. Biological parents have a reason for placing a child for adoption. An adopted child has a 'forever family', and hesitates to disturb anyone. EMOTIONS run hot and cold!! This is the heart of the excellent book. It is well written, sensitive, and most of all informative. Heritage Books publishes works other that Genealogy works. A book titled, ""How to find Birth Parents and Adopted Children..."" is not a.. ""How to find an adopted childs Patriot Ancestor""!"
2,Not a Genealogical Reference,"I bought this book after seeing it in a genealogical publishing magazine. I have friends and family that are adopted and thought this would help me help them with genealogical research. It did not. It is more of a touchy-feely kind of book, dealing with the emotional issues surrounding finding your birth parents or child, not the nuts-and-bolts of doing research. There were a few things in the chapter ""Needles in Haystacks"" but not enough that I would recommend this book to other genealogical researchers."
2,Morrissey for the beginner?,"Three years later and Im still trying to figure out the purpose of this album. Not a greatest hits but not a singles compliation either. Its tracks seems to have been assembled with a discography list and a dart board. Does contain a studio ""The Loop""; a plus in the minuses. Unless building a complete collection, Id stay away from this one."
5,Work great,"Used a bunch of these in my Samsung 40"" tv power supply. Tv still working great. If you need a cap, these work well"
3,Good Product / Bad Shipping,"Used this capacitor to repair the control board of a Vinotemp wine cooler - works great, fixed the problem - didn't have to spend $50 on a new board.BUT, $4.75 SHIPPING IS A BIG RIP-OFF - they shipped by regular postal service which took over a week - most of the package (large padded envelope) weight and contents was their catalog! So you're paying them UPS rates to ship postal service and send you their catalog - the shipping shouldn't cost more than $1.00 for a small padded envelope sent first class mail."
5,Very interesting,I found this very interesting and saw whet they went through in the production of Beowulf and Grendal. I enjoyed this very much
5,Highly Entertaining,"Even when you already know that the film did eventually get made, you'll find yourself drawn into the behind-the-scenes drama as the cast and crew deal with everything from a leaky Viking ship (which one crew member calls a metaphor for the project), set-flattening winds, a fire in the mead hall, and enough other tribulations that the unflappable director comments at one point that at least he hasn't seen any frogs falling from the sky. There's a lot of humour, and of course some incredibly beautiful scenery. If nothing else, you'll appreciate why a lot of filmmakers prefer to do their shooting on a soundstage rather than on location, at least if that location is someplace like Iceland in the fall!"
5,Shock and Awe!!,"I was, and am, a fan of Beowulf & Grendel for many reasons, one of which is the incredible vistas of Iceland. Little did I realize what hellish conditions the cast and crew endured to bring the film to life. Wrath of Gods takes us behind the scenes, from financial woes that very nearly shut down production at every turn, to acts of nature that blew away camps, vehicles, and very nearly people. Jon Gustafsson guides the viewer through the maze of obstacles that were thrown at director Sturla Gunnarsson and all others involved. The most amazing aspect is how they all managed to keep their humor and sanity intact. I'm thrilled to see Jon's documentary getting well-deserved accolades and awards, and also to see that Beowulf & Grendel is now being seen by more than just the few of us lucky enough to have experienced it on the big screen. After watching Wrath of Gods I dare you to complain about how tough your job is!"
5,wrath of gods,I'm happy with my purchase. Although I speak spanish I like to watch my dvd's in english with english subtitles and this item offered me that and much more because it also have the spanish language subtitles so the rest of my family can watch it too. Very interesting subjetc that keep my attention to the documental and made me apreciate the movie beowulf and grendel even more.
5,Great documentary!,"This is an awesome video! Amazing that Beowulf and Grendal was ever completed! Horrendous conditions! I bought it before I purchased the movie (which I also recommend), only for the Gerard Butler interviews and was not disappointed."
5,A favorite,"Love this sweet story with the illustrations! We sing it every year. The words are beautiful. Most books available at Christmas are about snowmen or Santa. I love that this is a Christian book, but is a bit different than the typical manger story."
2,Disappointing,"This was a gift for a ""first Christmas"" for a baby. It was not keepsake worthy. Poor quality, odd illustations. Would not recommend"
1,Stupid book,"Don't get this book, it's really bad. i think this is the worste book ever! about a little stupid boy with a drum. Who cares about the rest!"
2,Not a great buy,"I just received these earrings in the mail. I am very disappointed. The stone beads are very small. In this case you definitely get what you pay for. I was skeptical at first when I decided to purchase them, but due to the fact that another buyer gave them five stars I chose to take a gamble. One that didn't pay off.Since I didn't pay too much for them, I will keep them. But I will have to really think about purchasing from this company again. Not only where they earring not what I was expecting, the Free Light Blue Velvet Jewelry Pouch that was shipped with it looks to be stained. Had I know this I would have spent the money on something else."
4,More dynamite by Joanie!,"""Let's Talk About Love"" is about Joanie swinging hard again as only she can with a big band. My personal favorite is ""Till There Was You"". Although Tommy Oliver's brass is a bit over the top at times, Joanie's voice dances above it in all the selections."
2,One-sided to a fault,"Baker refuses to acknowledge a very real problem faced by libraries and their users: heavily used newspapers DO disintegrate. Yes, it would be nice if somewhere there were stored a mint condition copy of every book and newspaper ever printed. But keeping these volumes in mint condition means not letting anyone touch them, which would not do much to keep history alive! For all its faults, microfilm does allow people all over the world to read these newspapers. The money spent on microfilming was not wasted--it has provided unprecedented access to the stuff of our history. Baker is passionate and entertaining, but his passions take him too far with regard to newspapers, and other matters throughout the book."
1,Newsprint crumbles,It's a fact. Blaming librarians for the process of papermaking is disingenuous at best. One wonders if Baker resents the fact that librarians buy his books so that many people can read them without having to pay him a royalty.
2,size matters!,"This book probably provides useful information for persons otherwise unfamiliar with this genre of house and architecture, but personally I found two things about it particularly annoying: first, its small size. Many plans are reduced to the point where they might just as well be heavy line diagrams, and second, I find direct reproduction of original text to be far preferable to the uniform re-typing found here. Original text tends to be just as legible and lets the reader know with no uncertainty what is, in fact, original text. In all fairness, I have to say that since I am an architect and very familiar with house plans in general, my review may not apply to all readers. I much prefer the direct reproductions, and without a doubt favor a larger format."
5,A fascinating book about Sears Catalogue Homes,"I'm the author of ""The Houses That Sears Built"" and my love of Sears Homes was ignited by this wonderful book.The first 43 pages are photos and stories about real people and their real Sears Homes. This section makes for a delightful and easy read.And it is also a great reference on historic architecture. Sears Homes were patterned after the most popular architecture and housing of the day, so once you get a feel for the dates on Sears Homes, you'll be able to ""date"" many houses with some accuracy.Also has specific info on how to tell if you own a Sears Home.Rose Thorntonauthor, The Houses That Sears Built"
3,"a must-have, but flawed","If you're a budding Sears Home fan with the urge to go one step further, you have to get this book. As the only book with an example of each and every Sears Home, you can't feel confident in your Sears Home search without this book in hand. Nonetheless, the quality of the printing is disappointing. The illustrations from the Sears Catalog are reproduced so poorly as to lose much of their usefulness. If the picture is so blurry that you can't discern whether the house is clad with shake shingles or brick, then why bother? The Rosemary Thornton book does a much better job in that area, but, as it lists only a sampling of Sears designs, it is not definitive. Therefore this book, though flawed, is essential."
4,Houses By Mail,"The book is useful but has only b/w images, some of which are not the best. It covers the Mail order phenomenon pretty well."
1,Belt didn't last near long enough / Not exactly as described,"I only got about 2 months (30 hours on mower) of mowing with this belt. The belt is described as being an original Craftsman belt. This may be true if Pix makes Craftsman belts but it wasn't packaged or labeled as a Craftsman belt. I will probably be buying belts at auto parts stores (Gates belts) or a local outfit that has every belt under the sun. The prices are 3x as much but they are of much better quality. I am really getting tired of changing belts. And just a note, I keep my deck cleaned of debris and dry and I have inspected my pulleys for damage of which there is none. No reason for this belt to fail so soon."
1,Item appears to have been used,I ordered this perfume to my mother as a Christmas gift and once I received it I noticed it did not have the plastic wrap on the box like most brand new perfumes have. I didn't think much about it until my mother opened the box on Christmas and the perfume had a signifigant amount of perfume missing from the bottle. It appeared the bottle had bee used. I was not pleased with this item at all.
1,Avoid Beauty Encounter,"So I ordered perfume through Amazon insteadof going to the mall - and regret the decision.First of all, this product page may or maynot be correct - in my case it was incorrect.Second, I paid for expedited shipping.One day later, the package arrives, completewith the wrong perfume.Amazon insists I go through the seller.The seller insists they are just a fulfillmentcenter of Amazon.Customer Care Representative Anne and CustomerCare Manager Kelly act like they are doing me abig favor by waiving the restocking fee.Right now it I'm stuck overpaying forthe wrong perfume. Lesson learned - hopefullysomeone at Amazon will eventually help, becauseBeauty Encounter certainly does not stand bytheir products."
3,Returned item,"Rarely do I send anything back, however this is a big chunk of glass 3-5X's larger than any other Nikon converter lens. Bigger than the camera itself!Reason #1. Too big to carry around. Reason #2 I wasn't impressed with the optical quality either, blurry edges, erractic and difficult to focus and even with Nikon SB-800 hot shoe flash the lens shadow was included with indoor shots.Well at least I got to try it. The customer service I received from Ace Photo and Amazon.com was Great! I had to pay a 10% restocking fee and the initial shipping charges. I am very thankful to these guys in returning the items(converter mount) for otherwise I would had been stuck for my useage with a white elephant."
5,Past reviewers...look at the title of the CD more closely,"THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE SOUNDTRACK!!!There are some songs from the movie here but there are also songs ""inspired"" by the movie (similar to BT's CD of songs inspired by the movie Monster).Don't ding the CD because you had wrong expectations or couldn't comprehend its intent.If you want the soundtrack, go buy the soundtrack.Sheesh!"
3,not the same,"I was surprised that the songs on the movie are not played the same way as they are on the cd. I guess i would have too copy off of the movie to get the songs the way i would like. Overall the cd is good never heard those songs before. thats why I bought this cd, because of the movie. The movie was excellent by the way."
2,Did i miss the music?,"I really liked the music in the movie, but this wasnt most of what i liked. Maybe it was a different movie. I was disappointed."
2,Not their best...,"Most of this album consists of ok live versions of their hits, and a couple of soso studio cuts. Not their best, but still a worthwhile purchase for the hardcore fan."
5,Good Piece of Music,"I own this album on its original LP issue from Decca [DL-78750]. For the casual listener, this does remind many of funeral music. However, for those who have a keen interest in organ music, this is a spectacular piece to listen to. According to the album notes, these recordings were played by Mr. Crawford on the Lorin Whitney Pipe Organ in Los Angeles, California. I am not sure of the manufacturer. I would recommend this to anyone interested in knowing more about organ music or nostalgic music in general."
1,Why did this come up when I searched for Richard Simmons?,Here's a list of possible uses for this CD because this is NOT wedding music:1) Carnival2) Funeral3) Silent film4) Haunted House5) Broadway play5) MassIt's a pretty versatile CD. However I wouldn't recommend this for your wedding unless you want to get married in a graveyard.
1,Is this a wedding or a funeral?,"The music overall seemed to be too dark and ""heavy"". The deep sound of the pipe organ was not what I would like to hear for an uplifting occasion like a wedding. Save this disc as prelude music at your next funeral."
4,One of Joanie's best...,"I was fortunate enough to obtain most of Joanie Sommers' early albums in the 1980s, realizing how great a singer she was back in the 1960s. The folks at Warner Brothers were smart enough to market her music toward both teens and adults.Here, Joanie is given two distinct musical backgrounds...the first side with a blazing big band led by Marty Paich (recorded in studio), and the flip side with a jazz combo in live concert, with Bob Florence at the helm. Each of the 12 tracks is superb, but my personal favorite is ""My Ship"", which demonstrates how well she can get inside a ballad.The title of this album ""For Those Who Think Young"" is a fitting one because it was Pepsi's slogan back then (Joanie sang that well-known jingle). I'm happy that this album is on CD!!!"
1,The Lions of the North,"This review is NOT about the text; rather it is regarding the execrable job of editing by the publisher of the Kindle version. It appears that the text was pushed through a converter and made available for sale without the result even having been looked at. Some paragraphs have no indentation. Some paragraphs wrap only two or three words from the start. Some lines appear to have fixed length and thus wrap incorrectly. Where there is a break in the story and a double carriage return or other indicator is the norm, none exists, causing confusion for the reader. It is unconscionable to charge the customer $7.99 for this trash. It is apparent that for this publisher providing a quality product is secondary to charging far more than the product is worth."
4,Solid story,"King William adds Tanchelm of Ghent to the team of commissioners, and his smooth manner and genuine interest in the others defuse potential resentment. Their host Aubrey fought with Ralph under King William and is eager to show his guests every courtesy, even having his trained lions perform for them. But an unexpected murder sets the team searching for why as well as who.Not quite as complex or convoluted as earlier books in the series, but I found it more enjoyable. Whodunit was pretty obvious, but not why, and I think Marston left out some of the ""how"" needed to solve the mystery. But it held my interest all the way through."
3,Enjoyable but repetative,"Edward Marston aka Keith Miles is a marvel. He writes 3 or 4 books a year, juggles several different series at the time, and doesn't seem to get tired of it all.Unfortunately, the breathless pace is starting to catch up with him. "" Lions of the North"" the fourth book in the Doomsday series lacks freshness and allure of his previous works. It is well written and perfectly respectable and enjoyable book, but more than a bit repetative. Hopefully this is just an exception, his other works are well worth the time."
5,LOVE IT,"I Am In love with this product, Is the best thing ever, I had a severe case of acid reflux, That was ruining my life, I couldn't sleep well, I had to sleep in a sitting position, I had to take around 15 acid inhibitor pills every single day, I was not able to eat none of my favorite foods, I actually became Vegan because of my disease, even though even this diet was too much on me... I tried cabbage juice which is a lot of work, potatoes, I changed my doctor 3 times... Until I finally found this, a miracle, after a month of use I could eat stuff and not agonize in pain, The results are seen immediately, I have been buying this pills a lot, since this is free shipping don't expect it to be super fast, however it was fast for me..."
2,dissappointed,"i suffer from acid reflux ,looking for a natural cure i had high hopes for this product i used 2 bottles following directions, didn't see the slightest improvement on my condition in fact sometimes made the burning worse even tough i went hardcore watching my diet, very dissappointing product"
3,Does it help?,"Sorry - after a few weeks of using I noticed no improvement. Eventually I got better, but not because I was using this."
4,"Good, but expensive","I looked at other filters a lower prices, but opted for the Hoya due to their reputation for quality. Waiting for spring to see how this compares to infrared film."
2,"insufficient instructions, un-usable for digital","This filter did not come with sufficient instructions. I tried using it with my digital camera with NO results. I would NOT recommend it, unless you have an analog camera."
4,Good resource for the price,"Great dictionary... my two girls (2nd & 4th graders) love using it for homework and to famliarize themselves with everyday words. Very easy to read and uses each word in a sentence after the definition; book also has nice pictures and is not overcome by them as with other dictionaries. Overall, a good investment in my childrens' education and future."
1,Memories of Midnight,"This movie was terribly dissapointing. The Other Side of Midnight is one of my all time favorites and I could not wait to see this movie. The characters and story line are weak and unsophisticated compared to OSOM. I loved Jane's business attire, she dressed to the T in this movie and the scenery in Greece and Venice were lovely and that's about it. I would not watch this mini series again. Jane Seymore was wonderful in ""Somewhere in Time""."
3,Less than I expected.,"I've enjoyed Michelle's music for many years, and I knew she would put a twist to these Disney classics.She has, but I find the whole CD rather flat--though I cannot put my finger on what's missing or what might make it better.Die hard Shocked fans will probably like it, newcomers should be wary."
5,This is a great album- 5 stars!-,"I play it for my child everyday... I have never heard any other Michelle Shocked albums, but this one is so good I should check out her other ones. I heard this was a jam session too, like recorded in one evening.. Wow this woman must be talented to pull off such a high quality album in one night. This is a kid friendly album that both you and your child will cherish."
3,"Not as good as Jodeci, Dru Hill etc","For tru heads, this Group seems unimaginative and a rip off of the original bad boys of R&B, Jodeci. While smooth and taletned, this group poses no threat to take the throne from, groups like Next and Dru Hill. Not a must have but a good spin."
2,Not Que's best effort,"In the past, I used the QUE books by Kalani and the Transcender practice tests to gain my MCAD. I bought this book to help prepare for my next test (70-229) on the MCSD track, and I have been disappointed.I come from a programming background, not a SQL Server Admin background. This book is light on the kind of detail that Microsoft tests for in their exams. I am extremely displeased with the sections on replication, SQL Server Profiler, database security and performance tuning.Other sections such as the writing queries and stored procedure I found to be OK. But then again, most of my Sql Server experience has been in writing queries and stored procedures.Maybe this would be a good study guide for experienced SQL Admins. I can't answer that question. I do feel that us programmers would be better served by not using this book as a preparation guide."
3,a newly minted MCAD,"This book was marginally helpful in passing the 70-229 test, which I did earlier today. Don't get me wrong, I love the Que study guides, but this is not one of their best efforts. For example, the Que guide for the 70-320 test is a gold mine of sample code and working get-to-the-point examples. It was critical in my passing that one. This one is just a little too general and a little too non specific. If you want to nail this test, get the transcender practice tests and leave this on the shelf, or use it as a supplemental text and try another study guide."
4,Not bad,"I have just passed the exam with score 738. The exam was relatively difficult. I used the book to prepare along with MeasureUp exams. The book covers most of the areas needed for the exam but didn't go into enough details on security and performance optimization. Also you probably would need more practice with complex SELECT queries. (BTW, MeasureUp exam was almost completely useless)."
4,Good for exam and reference,"- This is a great book for studying and for reference around the office. I used it for the exam (and passed); my co-workers use it as a general reference at work.- As usual, Que did a great job editing. I found two mistakes, but they were very minor.- The sample questions / practice exam could use some re-working, but if you read this book through, the exam should not be too much hassle."
3,A good resource,"This book is a good resource for people who want to learn more about SQL server 2000 programming, but don't soley rely on it if your goal is to pass the exam. I used both Transender and this book and passed the exam."
4,Great FPS to add to your collection,"If you don't already have this highly-rated best seller, don't waste any more time. It's cheap, now it's on DVD (not to mention it comes with the latest patch) and it's loads of fun. My primary beef is that it has irritating save points instead of a proper quick save/load scheme, but I'm sure there was a good reason for it."
5,My skin care Bible,"Love, love, love this book! It has really helped me understand how to take good care of my skin. My skin used to be very dry, broke out a lot, had black and white heads. I have realized that i used the wrong products that only made my skin worse. I started exfoliating a lot and soon started seeing the results - my skin got brighter, not nearly as dry as it used to be, i got rid of those annoying blackheads, acne. Got rid of the appearing wrinkles. Great advices, looking forward to the new book by Dr. Denese. I also like her products very much. Don't care for the glycolic pads, they made my skin sticky and were simply not strong enough, but like her serums and creams. Her advices are the most valuable to me - they have really, really helped me! Thank you, Dr. Denese!"
3,Too Simplistic,"This book give you some basic information that might be useful for someone with limited knowledge of skin care. I found it to be too simplistic and ""one size fits all"". There is very little variaton recommended for different skin types, i.e., oily, dry, combination, young, mature, sensitive, etc. It you use as many AHA products as she recommended and you have sensitive skin, you could end up with some really red skin."
5,If you have Skin ..YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!,If you have skin you MUST read this book. As a 57 year old women I have reached the age of HELP ME PLEASE...That is exactly what Dr. Denese has spent her life studing. The dedication and love for people and skin care shows in each and every page of this book. I have also used her products which are availible on QVC and in my opinion only a face lift could work better!! She has been a God sent angel to me and I thank you so much Doctor for all your years of study and wonderful information. God Bless you!!
3,"informative, but a little too opinionated","I got this book from the library, and I'm glad I didn't buy it, because I don't think it had enough value that I'd want to own it. As other reviewers have said, her diet is impossible: no carbohydrates whatsoever within 3 hours of bedtime, no carbohydrates whatsoever at breakfast. (she suggests an eggwhites-only omelet, and says never to touch egg yolks.) I had read another book on skin care, by another doctor, and her book contradicts his over and over. Since she isn't giving reasons for her statements, I don't know who to believe.You will learn something about skin care from this book. But if I were you, I'd also seek out another opinion."
4,Informative,"I found Dr. Denese's book to be refreshingly open and honest about marketing schemes,labeling falacies and product claims. I found the information very useful in choosing a daily face regimen. Dr. Denese in no way endorses her own products, she merely allows you to find out what your skin type/age needs are and guides you on what to look for in your facial products, that will work for you. I have tried many products over the years and found very few that do what they claim to do, now I understand why, a specific ingredient that would allow such results would actully have to be used in greater amounts. But because there are no regulations on cosmetics,as long as the ingredient is listed on the bottle they can make the claim that the ingredient works in in their product. What they don't tell you is that it is only in trace amounts in most cases, which is why we don't receive the predicted benefits of their products. If you are serious about your skin I would recommend this book."
4,Better skin,This is a good book. There is a lot of information and the read is easy. The woman is a scientist at heart so this is scince applied to skin care. No off the cuff advice. I haven't read any other books focused purely on skin care. So I would buy this again.
5,Folk Music,"During the late 50 and early 60's folk music was popular and there were a number of groups and musicians performing in this style. Of those groups I found I listened mostly to the Kingston Trio. While it's been more than 50 years since I bought the LP record versions of these two albums, this CD has let me enjoy them all over again."
5,Lovely,My one-year-old son received this as a gift for Christmas and my husband and I enjoy it as well. Truly something we'll enjoy reading to him in the years to come.
5,"Great book, especially for boy toddlers!","The three-year-old that I nanny for LOVES this book, with all of Figwort's adventures before finally falling asleep. A must-have for a toddler boy!"
5,Lloyd Kaufman & the Independent Filmmaker's Tome,"Produce Your Own Damn Movie!, like all of the entries in Lloyd Kaufman's continuing ""... Your Own Damn Movie"" saga, takes us through a series of video vignettes and interviews that explore just what it takes to get your own movie off the ground and into production, even if your budget is a couple $2 bills and some loose cigarettes and change. I've been a huge Troma fan since the internal-gestation phase and this series is a pleasant insight into exactly how Lloyd and his studio have been able to make movie magic happen against the odds for almost 40 years. If you're an aspiring filmmaker, or even just a curious one, go for it: Lloyd is a candid and funny tour guide, and with interviews with the likes of David Cronenberg, Joe Dante, and Roger Corman it's a well-rounded look into how to do exactly what the title says: Produce Your Own Damn Movie!"
4,great second half,"this book truly exists from page 80 to 220. that's when the author starts talking about the transition from the transcendental realm of correspondence to the historical and on., page 80 should have been page one. there's been tons written on recognition so i wanted this book specifically for ""history and truth"". i got it after page 80. he's knowledgeable and clear and systematic in his approach. but just realize that you're buying the second half of the book with regard to history and truth. i'm glad i got it; that's still a good number of pages on the subject."
3,Won't order these again,"I use these in the air returns in my house for the purpose of collecting dust, debris & pet hair. I used to be able to get them at the local big box hardware stores, but they only carry pleated filters of this size anymore, and my HVAC guy told me that the pleated ones could be harmful to my furnace. The quality of these is so-so. The fiberglass seems very loose & I suspect a lot of debris could fall through this barrier. The ones I used to buy at the store were more dense & tightly woven. Maybe okay for the purpose I am using them for, but I think I am going to try and hunt for another source for these."

1,Trash,"This Graphic card is garbage.You shoud not sell this anymore.First time I installed it came already broken, I could't even taste it.It's a shame, I know it's not Amazon's fault, but if you want to avoid getting this kind of review you have to stop selling this."
5,Best card for older AGP boards,This is the best card for your AGP motherboard. I am not ready to switch to PCI-E just yet. I am able to play just about any game on this card. It is also very easy to OC right out of the box. Temps never go above 45C with normal cooling. Don't hesitate on this great buy. A+
4,Decent Price - Ok product,"Great price for 2 GB of memory. The casing is a cheap plastic...not very durable, but good enough for sharing data at home."
1,Sandisk dumped U3,"I recently purchased a U3 device. I added a few core apps that I thought would be useful and decided to add some more... WRONG! Sandisk has discontinued U3, there is no support, no software, no options. Sandisk has flipped any users the bird and just killed the sites. No warnings, no archiving for current users, just dead links.Thanks for nothing. DO NOT PAY EXTRA for U3! The only option is to uninstall U3 and install PortableApps from [...] Rumor is it's a better product anyway."
1,POC,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT...Unless you wish to experience a Red Chinese implemented exploit of Windows XP holes under the guise of ""U3.EXE"". It's no wonder they're cheap. Yes, you may run the SanDisk U3 removal tool - but don't expect portability between XP systems. U3 could have just as easily taken control of any user's system. The one I have was received during a San Diego SANS 560 course. There should be a class action suit brought against SanDisk for marketing this Piece Of Cr@p."
2,Plug pulled out (MAC),"The price was right and while it worked it was fine. I DID notice that the plug is a very snug fit on a MAC (plugs in better on a PC). And finally, pulling it out of the MAC, the plug came apart from the housing. For a while I would stick the plug back in to use it but finally, it wouldn't make contact and I was lucky to get my info off. Maybe with a MAC you have to have a lighter touch, or wiggle it back and forth to get it out?"
5,Great product,I purchase a couple Kingston Data drives a while ago...but SanDisk is SO much better. The U3 technology is GREAT!
2,confusing to use,"Keep getting confusing messages with U3 that tell me I may have errors when saving a file, but am not told what to do. I have the SanDisk Cruzer mini,but do not have any problems with that product. Am beginning to have doubts about some SanDisk products."
1,Outrageously intrusive U3 software makes this product less than worthless.,"Any conceivable positive the product might have is overwhelmed by the awful U3 software. Plug this darn thing in and it literally takes over your computer installing an obnoxious program without your permission. Sure, you can figure out how to eventually uninstall it, but is it takes precious time.It is hard for me to believe that any engineer or product designer anywhere could have OK'd this design. It is just plain utterly and completely without redeeming value for 99% of all users.Avoid this product like the plague. Unless, of course, you enjoy products that are poorly designed and intrusive to boot.ZERO stars, if this was possible. Unadulterated garbage. It offends me that any US corporation could have been so stoopid."
1,Another User dissatisfied with U3,"I bought this item elsewhere without knowing anything about U3 -- that's what I get for not reading the reviews here first. I can't use U3 at work because my employer has strict controls on the PCs. And I can't use it at home because I have a Mac. For the same reasons, I can't even run the d*!*@$ software SanDisk offers to remove U3. I returned the drive, and I won't buy another SanDisk product with U3 installed."
3,Cheep & the U3 junk is easly removed,"26 bucks for a 2G thumb drive! It is a little on the flimsy side but not any worse then my PNY Attache that crumbled around the USB connector after 6 months. I'm still undecided about the lack of a dust cap, but the lock on the slide out USB connector is still working. The U3 software is VERY annoying & caused problems at work but I think its part of the reason for the low price & its easily removed just get the removal tool from scan disk [...]"
1,The retractable tip fails to protect the plug from damage,"Forgetting the horrible idea of the U3 software installed on the drive, the retractable tip does not protect the drive. True it does retract the plug so that it will not bend or break off (and how often has anyone had that happen except when trying to remove it from a computer?) but IMHO the major 'risk' to the plug is for foreign materials to get into the plug and clog it up. Remember, that's why the cap was put there in the first place, to prevent pen tips, paper scraps and other briefcase or pocket debris from getting into the plug. Retracting the plug still leave it open to debris and other foreign materials such as liquids since the end is still open to air. I'd rather just cover the tip with the plastic cap which protects it just as well from bending and prevents foreign materials from getting stuck in the plug."
4,"Works Fine, Without the U3","The very first thing to do with this drive is to remove the U3 software, which is far too slow, too clunky and and too intrusive. I considered keeping it, but despite the advertised portability it would not work with my work computer. I did, however, come to like the idea of having applications on my flash drive and found that the Portable Apps Suite (Google it, it is easy to find) does the job U3 is advertised to do much better and without the hassles.Outside of the worth then useless but easily removable U3 software this is a fine piece of hardware that I used daily."
1,Too Many Problems,"It's just a storage device. It should be simple. This is not simple. Often the drive goes unrecognized and this happens on any computer I use. I have to unplug and plug back in the drive until it gets recognized (happens @ home, school, Kinkos, Staples, etc.) Also the software is fairly useless and it gets in the way and slows work time. If the information you're saving is important I recommend using another brand. I have to buy a different drive and back-up constantly since I feel I am taking a risk whenever I use this device.Also, as stated in many other reviews, the user has no choice regarding the software of the device. It will load onto your computer everytime you plug it in. The practicality of the software depends on if I want to spend extra money: Do I want to use the Skype applications? I need to purchase a subscription. Game applications? Photosmart? AntiVirus? All of these are included aplications in the software and all require paid subecriptions to enable."
1,no technical support available,This product stopped working a few days after purchase. 5 phone calls and 2 emails were not returned by SanDisk. This product did not work as advertised and no technical support of any kind is available. I would not buy this brand again.
1,Don't get this if you use a Mac,"I purchased the Cruzer 2gb but it's a disappointment. If you use a Mac you end up with 2 volumes on your desktop, one that you can use and the other a CD icon (e.g. Read Only file system). While you can reformat the drive you can not do anything about the included CD volume (aka U3) and every time you want to eject the damm thing you have to eject 2 volumes. I just want a simple high capacity device for moving files around and this is hugely inconvenient. It's going back to office depot tomorrow."
3,Washable,My brother owns this flashdrive and he notes no particular problems with it. He just wanted to note that he has accidentally washed and dried this piece of equipment in the laundry and it continues to work.
1,No U3 Security Feature,"This device is ok in terms of look and funtion, but there is no security built in like others. My friend had memorex with U3 and has a security passowrd to protect the drive. But greet from Sandisk management removed the U3 security feature, forcing you to buy the third party encrption software. Do not buy this if you need to secure your drive. Buy Memorex mini travel drive. That was my first choice, but changed my mind because of new retractable design from Sandisk. Now I regret it. If you are desperate for security, you can spend time installing the freeware TrueCrypt."
2,"Handy, but has a serious flaw for web work","Neat, small, nicely retractable, holds a lot of info, however...it changes the file names! Changes some lower case file names and extensions to all caps. Not all files, only some of them - folders, images, other files, maybe the folder and all items in it, but not the next folder in the list. Very strange.This is not so serious for transferring casual work, but if you're doing web work where upper and lower case file names DO make a difference, this is a big problem. Causes extra work - have to change the file names back to what they were - sigh.If anyone knows a fix for this, please post. Thanks. Meanwhile, I'm going to get myself another drive - this is a big time waster."
1,"Intrusive, confusing. Avoid U3!","There are better choices than this. Anything that does not use the U3 software is preferable. It seems that with U3, SanDisk has a solution that is desparately seeking a problem.So I recommend that you stay far away from this product. I've had good results with Kingston and Memorex thumbsticks."
1,Why Complicate Things So Much?,"Like many others have already said, this should be a simple device: just a USB storage device for holding files. But no. The genius engineers and marketing gurus get their mitts on it and turn it into a nightmare. The BS application that runs evertime you insert the damn thing is a true waste. I JUST WANTED A SMALL STORAGE DEVICE!!! Mine's coming right back at ya, Sandisk - eat it!!"
5,Love it,"At the time, I got this for a very good price for a 2GB drive. Others may complain about the U3 software; personally, I use it ALL THE TIME. Google search for U3 shortcut creator for links to an application that allows you to put shortcuts to various things in your launchpad and I think you'll see how this can be very useful :)"
1,Your mileage may vary.,Other people have had much better success with this product than I have. I'm very dissatisfiedwith Sandisk's customer support.This drive failed on me about after about 6 months of use on both Windows XP and Mac OS.I contacted Sandisk customer support at sandisk.com who suggested a variety of things to try toresurrect the drive on both Windows XP and Macintosh OS X. Nothing worked.They then suggested I contact the RMA department to enact a returnand from that point on the RMA department and support have been completely silent.They will not respond to email or support tickets.I won't be purchasing any further Sandisk products if they won't honor issues covered under what they claimis a two year warranty.
2,Slow and inefficient,"I bought this drive, in part, because it had U3, so I'm not complaining about that. U3 is moderately useful if you can deal with its shortcomings.What I can't accept is how slow and inefficient this flash drive is. I copied a 207 MB XAMPP folder to the drive which took over 40 minutes and required over 420 MB of space on the drive. Copying the same folder to an external USB hard drive took only 4 minutes and 209 MB of space. So the SanDisk drive is 10 times slower and has more than 100% overhead in this case. SanDisk customer support was useless. They made no attempt to diagnose the problems, which is clearly inherent in the drive. They simply sent a replacement which exhibits the exact same problems.The replacement will be returned."
1,avoid this purchase,Installed software is unnecessary and it creates lots of headache. And it can be a nice way for viruses to spread.
3,Uninstall the U3 software right away!!!,"First off, I bought this drive today and thought I'd give the preinstalled U3 software a try so I downloaded and installed a few applications including portable Firefox by yourbrainz.Well Firefox worked great except that it overwrote my bookmarks on my regular Firefox installation - meaning I had apparently lost 5 years worth of bookmarks instantly.After uninstalling Firefox portable, my bookmarks reappeared (lucky for me and for yourbrainz).All the negative comments about the U3 software are true. This software is worse than useless. On the U3 software site, if you add '/uninstall' to the main url (www.u3.com) you'll get the uninstall page. Use it. Do this right away since the uninstall deletes everything off the drive, not just the U3 software.Once U3 is gone, the drive is fine. So I would give it zero stars if you keep the U3 software, and 5 stars if you ditch it. Shame on Sandisk for forcing this upon us."
2,Mac users stay away,"As a piece of hardware, the cruzer is fantastic. It is sleak and small, and the transfer rates are FAST.But...The drive comes preinstalled with this very annoying U3 software. If you have a Mac, not only are the U3 features useless, but there is no way to remove them! You cannot simply reformat the drive to get rid of it; doing so will render the drive unreadable by PCs. I learned the hard way.Now I have to find access to a PC (not easy in California!) and use a piece of HP software to repair my drive. How annoying!"
1,3 of these crashed and took my data with it,"I used one of these for a year, but it stopped working unless you held it down while it was connected. I liked the software password protection and maybe it was my fault for letting my keys hang off it so I bought another of the same model. A week later I was using it and suddenly it started giving a red light and wouldn't be recognized by any computer. I figured that was a fluke and got a third of the same (although for 2 and 3 i never hung keys off it and always used up-to-date commercial anti-virus on both the computers i was using and the drive itself). Now (after less than a week of working) it just says ""You must format this device before you can use it"" and when i click format it says ""G: not found."""
1,Disaster,"I bought this after I lost my old usb which I loved. I have the 4gb one, and I found that this one asks you if you would like to install the U3 crap, which I denied cause it has no purpose but to take up more space. The slider is difficult, and once out, it sits at an angle and is a pain for me to get into my usb port. now comes the devastation. I wrote a 6 page term paper, a 14 page review packet, and a powerpoint. I loaded all of my projects onto my sandisk as I do with all of my school things. I opened them later, on my same computer, and they are all gone. I tried for hours to recover them. Only part of the powerpoint remained. Whenever I opened them it asked me what version I wanted to read the script with, and no matter what option I tried it gave me odd symbols and letters. I have had about four usb drives, and this is the first, and last, sandisk I will ever purchase."
1,Corrupt Files,I have only been using my USB for one week now and I keep getting corrput files on this drive. Some of them repair themselves but not back to normal and the others cannot be fixed. A search on google will show others complaining of corrupt files. I do not recommend this product at all. Buying a different brand today.
4,Troublesome,The weird design makes it a little difficult to handle. The usb plug thing tries to go inside the plastic case when fitting it in. Other than that it's just another memory stick with some fancy pseudo OS already installed.
2,Feels really cheap. Activity light is too bright and big.,"I have owned or handled close to 10 different USB drives and this one feels the cheapest. If this were to be in a loose pocket and I were to sit on it, I am not so sure it would survive. It has a very light and cheap feeling case.I also to not like the color of the activity light. Plus it is too bright and big. It lights up the whole white retracting switch an orangish red color. I use this for my USB mp3 player in my car and it is a little bright at night."
1,great hardware - lame software,"This product looks ok, but it comes from the company configured as 2 drives, and when you connect, it forces the host computer to install some bull**** disk management software in order to recognize the part you can put files on.Another poorly written, poorly implemented piece of management software that users are forced to install in order to use the drive."
2,Good Product but we don't know what this U3 this...,"Everything looks good. Except this U3. I wish someone can explain, in simpler terms what in the world it does to an average consumer.It is like the sales rep in Circuit city rep saying "" It has got 120Hz and a video processor blah blah""....all fine but what in the world does that bring to me? So sales reps or anyone doesn't seem to understand this simple question!"
1,Buy one that doesn't need a special driver,"This thin is ok, until you try to use it on another computer and need to install a driver. There is no obvious choice on the Scandisk support site.M|S"
1,U3 Nightmare!,The U3 software is a nightmare. You don't have an option not to install. No uninstaller or ininstall instructions come with it. You're forced to Google to figure out how to get rid of this garbage. The drive would be fine without it.
1,Includes a very annoying application you can't get rid of,"I want to rate this 0 stars, but the choices are 1 to 5.Anyway, I returned mine. It has a very pesky application that pops up every time you insert the drive.Worse you can't delete it.What was SanDisk thinking of?"
4,Just to clear things up,The software that automatically installs has an option to remove it. I don't see why this is a big problem with all these reviewers. I've used ScanDisk before and did not really have any problems at all.
1,U3 Software a Disaster,"I bought this drive to replace a smaller capacity Sandisk drive that I was very happy with. However, the U3 software supplied on this drive makes it virtually useless. The U3 software caused my computer (and another) to repeatedly lockup. Sandisk technical support suggested that I use another application to remove the U3 software from the drive. Unfornately, the removal application doesn't work any better than the U3 software. I would stay away from any usb drive the includes U3!!!"
3,If you dont want U3 then dont buy a U3 drive.,"A lot of people are complaining about the software loading by its self, well DUH. Its a U3 drive that's what its supposed to do. If you did not want the U3 software why did you buy a U3 drive? The drive works as it was designed U3 and all. If you just want storage buy something else."
2,Installs software without permission,"GOOD POINTS* Small* Fast* No cap to worry aboutBAD POINTS* Installs software without permission: When you plug in the drive, it uses a hack to take advantage of the CD-ROM autorun vulnerability to install U3 software without your permission. (At least once it's installed, the software has an option to reformat the USB drive without the U3 software.) You can also defeat the auto-install by keeping the shift key held down when you plug in the drive.* Slider lock will wear out: SanDisk's mechanism for locking the connector in the extended position will wear out. After about half a year of heavy use, you will have to firmly hold the slider down when connecting the device.* The packaging is difficult to open.SUMMARYI would have given this four or five stars if it didn't use a hack to force software on me. Other than that, the drive is pretty nice."
2,Deceived !!,The Ultra3 software that auto launches from this USB drive does indeed install software on every pc you plug it into. It does not ask before installing. It automatically launches when you plug it in and creates a c:\documents and settings\user\application data\u3 subdirectory. This directory does not disappear when the device is ejected. This was confirmed by SanDisk Tech Support after they told me it left no trace initially. For me this is unacceptable as I use it on PCs that are not my own. When the drive is plugged in it creates a CD drive and a removable drive. The CD drive is where U3 software auto launches from. To stop it from auto launching you have to get rid of the CD partition. That tool is not provided by SanDisk but if you look around on th internet you can find it. The RAM is this drive is also very slow.
2,you can disable U3 feature,I agree that there should be an optional U3 uninstaller program coming with the product. I guess there were too many people complaining about U3 launchpad since they put an uninstaller for U3 at [...]. It works and completely removes U3 feature as well as its launchpad.
4,"Great USB Drive, just need to uninstall annoying U3 Feature!","Right out of the box is a weird USB drive, i mean weird, because when you first connect it to the pc it opens the U3 Annoying Software feature, and installs itself without asking anything. It will be OK if at first it asked if you want to have that ""Smart Drive"" feature or just a Normal ""Dumb Drive"" used as usual. What i did is actually uninstalll the U3 feature right from the U3 menu and keep it as a normal USB storage drive. Now its a great USB storage drive with plenty of space to have lots of documents, pictures, videos, etc, etc, etc. If you want a ""Smart Drive"" function i recommend the www.PortableApps.com software, is freeware, easy to install and it does ask you to use this function or not when you plug your drive into a computer, with the same (or better) functionality as the U3 feature."
1,SanDisk,"Vista gives a message that this device is not ready boost ready. It will run in Vista, but no noticable speed increase. I later learned Microsoft now has a list of proven devices that work well with Ready Boost. (Oh well)."
1,very frustrated - U3 only mentioned in small print on back of packaging!,"The packaging advertises SanDisk Cruzer Micro USB Flash Drive 2.0GB. What the heck is U3!!!??? On the back of the packaging, in very small print, it mentions U3 with a website. The product packaging fails to warn buyers of the U3 obligation. I'd never heard or seen the term U3 until I inserted the stick into my computer. There was no reason for me to think it would be any different from other sticks i've used.For ease of use do not buy the ""Sandisk CRUZER micro 2.0GB"". This may be a great product for those familiar with U3 but I officially hate this stick because of the time i've wasted trying to get it to work and now remove the U3 software it installed on my home and work computer. I've used other sticks without problem and will unfortunately need to return this product for something easier to use."
1,AVOID U3 ... BE WARNED,"The U3 software is forced on you by trickery and cunning on the part of SanDisk, who formed U3.Please avoid any products with U3 software to send a message that we don't want this. Make it fail and they will give up on it."
5,Fun Fun Fun!,"I had been searching for fun jewelry, specifically pins, to decorate my jean jacket. I was so excited to come across Artazia! The pin is perfect. There are lots of different colors so I can match it with different tops easily. This piece is so unique whimsical. I plan on buying more jewelry as Christmas presents this year."
1,OMG!,This is the worst ppv I have seen since... I can't think of a worse event.The main event... Dana almost fired the winner! That's how bad it is. Crocop and Mir hugged (not grappled) and talked and laughed the entire time! Not even a sparring session!
4,Professional Careers Sourcebook by Savage/Dorgan,"This is a good text on the details of major career categories.The information guide will help with career planning for thefollowing professional categories:- managerial- engineering- computer science- the social sciences- teaching- health- technology- the visual artsThe book lists literature sources to help with professionaltest preparation, education, awards, fellows, grants andaids to facilitate entry into the job categories described."
1,Awful disturbing Pointless Movie!,I would like to thank the lady who made this drivel for wasting a half hour of my life(which was all I could watch). Basically its about a spoilt over indulged slut married to a hard working man(She cheats on her husband before and after marriage and while he is in the army). The daughter is cut from the same cloth as the mother and prostitutes and exploits her vulgar mother. What a shame that people like to profit by dredging their family through the mud. Unbelievable....
3,it wasnt what i expected,I got them and try to work with it once but it wasn't really fitting my right hand and cut my skin off.
2,Not the Item in the Photo!,"The product was shipped in a timely manner. That's the only reason I'm giving it two stars. The product I received is NOT the item in the photo. It is made of a VERY thin, dull, aluminum and is quite flimsy. Save your money."
5,a welcome release,I have been waiting for this album to be released on CD and am thrilled that it is finally here. I so loved this album and hope that through this release more people can appreciate their music. Wayland is one of the most deeply spiritual and moving pieces I have ever heard.
2,Cluttered and Casual,"Gary Dahl offers useful exersizes for the right hand, focusing on the several inversions of various chords and learning to hear melody within those chords. However, the text is minimal, with few explanations to put things into useful context, and the layout is visually cluttered. Worse, the accompanying CD features the author wasting valuable disk time reading text instead of providing uninterrupted musical examples. At one point he jokes that he is running out of time, but that doesn't seem to deter his apparently unrehearsed (and generally unhelpful) banter.Note to publishers: When printing music books, use a binding that allows the book to lie open to any given page when placed on a music stand or desk."
3,clancy's editor needs to grow a spine,"there seems to come a time in the career of every contemporary bestselling author when, due to his/her past success, (a) he/she comes to believe that every word he/she deigns to commit to paper is golden and unalterable; and (b) his/her publisher and/or editor (out of fear of losing him/her, perhaps), grows afraid to tell him/her otherwise. the result? bloated, overblown books like this one. it's happened to dean koontz, it's happened to patricia cornwell, and now, sadly, mr. clancy seems to have fallen prey to his own ego. my advice to the prospective reader? go for the abridged version, if at all possible...."
2,Where's The Pace & Climax ?,I recently finished Red Rabbit and was mildly disappointed. A great concept and idea for a story line. The time period is interesting and I enjoyed that portion of the story. The time period was interesting as it is right dab smack into the Cold War and pre-internet and everyday wireless technology. However the ending is predictable and the book is hardly with any suspense. The action parts (or lack there of)were slow and not suspenseful. Pace of the book was painfully slow. Like I said mildy disappointing and expected it to be much better.
1,There are better books out there to help you plan a party!,"I found the book to have basic common sense information, no real ideas! It was one of 3 books that I purchased and I ended up returning the book and keeping the other 2 books. But, if you need help with how to get organized, this is the book for you! The cover and title are misleading."
1,Not a good value for the price.,"The title of this book is misleading and implies that you will find lots of ideas for party games for young children. But I did not find this book useful at all. There are much more better books you will find that are bigger in size and content wise, they give you lots more organized ideas for planning and conducting birthday party games. Most of the comments the author makes such as how to serve ice cream to children is common sense information to parents with toddlers and you don't need a book to tell you how to do that. This book is not a good value for what it costs."
3,Good basic text for parties for younger children,"If you're new to party-giving, this book will be a wonderful way to have your hand held through your first event. It is filled with ""learn from our mistakes"" wisdom no new parent should be without. Many of the ideas are useful even in everyday life. I loan this book out a lot."
5,"I would call it ""definitive""","They are both great albums, but ...From the ""Hungry i"" defines this group and their broad appeal. Great rapport with the audience, great topical wit, and outstanding preformance. A very talented group indeed. Each song from this set is just pure gold."
5,Great to hear these voices again,"This is the group we all sang with and laughed with. It's hard to just listen to The Kingston Trio, you find yourself joining in. This CD has excellent sound and is a good representation of the group's wit and harmony. Though there are many favorites on this CD, the classic Scotch and Soda makes it all worth the price."
4,Decent.,I got this CD when it was first released and realized its intensity and Mile's like sound . I was too young really to appreciate how technically challenging it is even if you study Miles. It's a good listen but not causual music. I sold it years back and now have it again. I hope Roney is still growing like Miles who never stopped with the 50-60's sound.
3,Unfulfilled Potential,"Wallace Roney has one of the most beautiful trumpet tones since Miles but his recorded output after his straight-ahead Muse sides has been slim and uninspired. The theory here seems to be that if you like Miles 60's quintet, you'll like this. Sorry, but the meandering, abstract tunes never catch fire. The sound is nice but the feeling is strange. No swing or fire. His next CD, ""Village"" is much better with more life. I'd recommend his Muse reissue compilation (on 32 Jazz), ""No Job Too Big or Small"" for well-played, swinging classic jazz, but Roney needs a creative breakthrough if he's going to make his mark in the '00s."
3,"Becoming dated, missing some key topics","Basic concepts are, I think, well presented. This is terribly important because even those of us who are used to working with web applications might find Zope very different from anything we've used before. This would earn it four stars except for one serious flaw: the book is rather dated. There is no coverage at all of Zope Page Templates or METAL, which are very important topics in today's Zope.I reduced the rating to three stars because of essential deployment topics that I wanted to see covered that were also completely missing. SSL, the zope.conf file, using Zope in conjunction with Apache, for example. There's probably more, but I just don't know yet that I don't know them.So I give it three stars for being useful, but having significant flaws. You are better off going to Zope.org and getting the latest on-line docs from there."
5,Solid introduction to the Zope world,"If you've spent much time at all on the Zope site, you know who Amos and Michel are. This book is the accumulation of several years of work and an excellent public comment period in which real Zope users were encouraged to find errors/make suggestions/etc. I've been developing with Zope for about two years now and this is the book I wished I'd had when I started.The Zope Book covers everything you'd expect in an Intro To type book, and has plenty of hands on workshop to get the reader into the real world of using Zope. It also makes a great reference book for more experienced Zope-istas."
2,Not at all what it promises ..,It was beyond the scope of the book on how to connect with an existing Web Server - Apache in my case.It was beyond the scope of the book on how to connect with a non-Zope database (PostgreSQL in my case).It was beyond the scope of the book on how to use Perl scripts with Zope.It was beyond the scope of the book on how to install new 'products' (similar to Perl modules).Pretty much anything that you might want to do with Zope beyond a beginners overview is beyond the scope of this book. But then Im quickly learning that the Python community doesn't much believe in accuracy or completeness in any of their 'documentation'.
3,Not for older kids with allowances,"I bought this to encourage my almost-five-year-old to be more motivated to do his chores and independent skills (like getting dressed) on his own, without my nagging. I ended up still nagging him, and I decided that the token thing was rather meaningless for a child who already had a (small) allowance and was used to actual coins. I even printed out a reward chart with pictures of what he could earn with his tokens, but it was just too large of a stretch for him to make the connection between earning tokens and the rewards (too abstract), I think. I decided to make each chore worth a certain (coin) amount, and just got rid of the chart all together (ended up in the trash). It may work with younger children who haven't been exposed to real money/coins yet, but all the little pieces (cards and tokens) would still be exasperating."
5,Vintage Favorite,"Lovely! Just lovely! Have the liquid hand soap in my guest bathroom. Those new to my home inevitably ask....""what is that wonderful soap'."
5,Great!,Very prompt! It came in the mail way before the due date and exactly the way it was described.
4,Charlie St Cloud,"I thought that this was a great film. One gets tired of blood and gore after awhile and it is refreshing to just lose yourself into a fantasy that ends well for a change. I thought Amanda Crew was outstanding, even though the film was supposed to revolve around Zac and his brother I do not think that it would have worked at all without her. She showed emotion but did not overdo it...whereas I thought Efron except in one place did not show hardly any emotion. Now maybe this was the idea of the film that he was wounded by the loss of his brother and therefor ""numb"" to life .There were ""holes "" in the film also. After a brief part for Zacs mother she disappears from the film as doesTess's mother. I just think that part was unrealistic and left kind of an empty spot.It was a very good story and....I would sail off into the sunset with Amenda anytime."
4,St.cloud,"wanted to see it for a whil, this movie doesn't disappoint. This film has lets the viewer experience a wide variety of emotions. keep the tissues near be."
3,Fairly Good,"Not an Oscar Winner by any stretch of the imagination, but not unwatchable either. Critics panned this movie and especially Efron's performance. I didn't think either one was that bad. Maybe I am easy to please or just a sap, but I thought the movie was okay and did not regret watching or buying it.Not for everybody, but what movie is?!!"
3,"Okay, but it's a renter","I heard great things about this movie, so I had high expectations going in. I have to say, I was disappointed. It was a beautiful piece in regards to cinematography and storyline, but the actual substance of the movie was lacking. The characters were distant, so the emotion of the movie fell short and the relationships seemed superficial (although, the first fifteen minutes were promising). The movie was rather predictable, as well. I'm just glad I rented it instead of bought it, and I advise others to do the same. While, it's not a terrible movie, I really wouldn't want to watch it more then once or twice."
4,Charlie St Cloud,"I read so many negative things about this film and especially Efron's performance, that I was greatly shocked and pleased with the film. I liked the weaving of this life and the afterlife and the open possibilities of what might lie ahead. I found it to be food for thought and liked it quite a lot."
4,Charlie St. Cloud Movie,I thought the story was very good and kept your interest throughout the movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
4,What a great movie!,I love this movie b/c it's heartfelt w/ beautiful scenery. The lead actress in it is fantastic even though she is not well known. Zac Efron is an amazing actor and I am sure will become even better as he ages. I have recommended this movie to all of my friends.
3,Charlie St. Cloud,The movie had it's good moments but the premise was a litle strange and I kept hoping the story would get better.
3,Saw the movie... not as good as expected,"I watched this movie with three friends (Age 12,12,13 and I am 12.) We all disliked the movie because it was sooo depressing. Many people die and it was not like what it looked like on the commercials. The movie seemed to drag on. On the flip side the acting was strong and we may not have been the targeted audience. People who like Zac Efron will probably enjoy this movie more than I did."
2,mediocre,The movie was slow going. Good acting but not a good story line and sad and not upbuilding and a poor ending.
2,Universal Pictures Misses the Mark,"I rented this movie on NetFlix. Would have rated it better until I discovered that the rental version did not include the Bonus portion even though it was on the menu. I guess that Universal Pictures marketing decided that they could sell DVD's if they didn't include this in the rental DVD. For me it had the opposite effect, an now when I go to buy a DVD I will make sure it is NOT Universal Pictures. I seriously doubt that people will flock to the store to buy a DVD just to get the Bonus portion. Seems like Universal Pictures has an idiotic Marketing/Management group.Charlie St. Cloud"
1,Charlie St. Cloud,"I was very unhappy with my purchase. The seller listed the DVD as ""like new"". It was a Blockbuster movie rental which is hardly new! They have been viewed many, many times and the case was scratched up without art. I paid $7.48 for the DVD including shipping and was able to buy a brand new DVD at Best Buy for $9.99 with free shipping! It's worth the extra couple bucks to get a much higher quality DVD."
3,Read the Book!,"I purchased this movie because the book was soo amazing. Although the movie is good and well acted I was dissapointed. There were several important scenes in the book the movie left out. I feel as if the book gave more depth to the story. Zac Efron did a lot better job than what I gave him credit for, this guy will become a great actor. I believe he's on his way to becoming the next Brad Pitt or George Clooney. I recommend this movie for people who have not read the book, but I also still suggest you read the book."
2,A Far Cry From High School Musical----Ugh.,I was a bit excited to see a performance of Zac Efron but only disappointment came to a point I did not finish watching this. Just didn't like the storyline at all!
4,Nice to see again,I enjoy having a few movies on my kindle fire so that I can watch them now and again. This is one of those movies.
5,Wonderful but Sad,"If you don't like movies that tap into your emotions don't watch this. But otherwise you'll love this movie. It's got great performances by all the cast. This movie actually caused me to forgive Zac Efron for being that guy from High School Musical. He gave a very mature and convincing performance as Charlie. The kid who played his brother, Charlie Tahan, gave an equally effective and brilliant performance as Sam St. Cloud. Hope to see Tahan in more things soon. The story is very well done and the direction is strange and heart crushing.I give this a 10 out of 10."
2,OK movie but not one of my favourite.,Was not sure what to expect so kept an open mind. Zac I felt played his part well and the story was understandable of one finding it hard to let go of a lost one. Loved the brother relationship between these two brothers and how guilty he must have felt.This movie however is not one I would worry to watch again.
2,"Wow, Really Bad","While this movie did entertain me, it did not entertain me in the way I expected. Charlie St. Cloud is just plain bad, but at least I was able to get a good laugh out of it. Though lazy writing largely characterizes this movie, the lack of flow was just as bothersome. I don't blame the actors too much for the awkwardness, but it was in fact overacted, over-dramatized, and the lack of chemistry between the two leads distrated me from what might have been an OK plot. On top of that, this movie was packed with cliques. Far too many for me to stomach. Had to laugh or roll my eyes. Chose to laugh instead."
4,"Great book, Great movie","Actually one of the few movies I watched before reading the book. I am a Zac Efron fan, but looking pass that, the movie was really good in my opinion. I read the book afterwards, and there were many differences. I like the book way better, but still really enjoy the movie's interpretation of the story."
3,just ok,"I heard good things about this movie so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's ok, I'd watch it again if there wasn't anything else on tv."
5,Beautiful movie,This is the first movie I have seen with Zac Efron after all the High School Musical hype (which I avoided). He played a beautiful part and did a superb job at it. A very touching movie. Certainly one you could watch over again. Pleased to have it in my collection and I'll be looking for mor of Zacs movies in future
5,A good movie.,"Everything Zach does is touching. I really don't know why that is but I guess some people were just born with ""it.""This movie was simply amazing! A compelling film which pulled at your heart strings! Zac's performance in this movie was A+ as usual. And the storyline ran as smooth as can be. It was a little predictable but in a good way. I definitely recommend this movie but don't forget your tissues because I cried a bit. :)"
2,"Easy to read, use as a control systems review.","This is a companion to ""Modern Control Systems"" by Dorf & Bishop. Much of the text of this book refers back to the ""parent"" text, and as such some sections of this text seem somewhat ""incomplete"". Easy to read, good as a stand-alone review of control systems. Not much on ""modern control"" (most of the book covers classical control). Not a whole lot of Simulink content, mainly Matlab functions used for specific topics. Good example systems."
4,dear diary,"very nice, beautiful graphically. very nice story. in the same clubhouse with henrik drescher and maira kalman."
3,OKAY,An okay CD of the 'good ole' Jerry Lewis comedy of yearsteryear. Jerry was one of the greatest. All of Europe knows this. Why not his own America?
3,Doing What's Right: How to Fight for What You Believe- - And Make a Difference,This was a very informative book. It gave true life accounts of everyday events and how to cope with it.
5,Self-empowerment-the right idea,"I love this book. Instead of wild rhetoric, farfetched solutions, and fingerpointing, Brother Smiley not only shares the message of self-empowerment, he gives people a constructive and educational guide on how to do this and improve their lives and condition. Muy bueno senor!"
3,Read with a grain of salt.,"Tavis Smiley provides an inspirational, although somewhat impractical guide to living in a more peaceful and spiritual way. Some recommendations are made through rose colored glasses but all in all, a heart felt attempt.- Gemma"
4,Tavis hits the nail on the head.,"After reading Thomas Sowell and Jesse Lee Peterson (gasp, sigh, those smug pooh bahs really are something) I find a man, Tavis Smiley, that, what a concept, cares for his people. Smiley shows compassion not hurtful, unhealthy, and mean spirited criticism. But his solutions can help us all. Thats the great thing about those of us on the Left. Smiley's book is truly a great work full of ways for US, the common man to let our voices be heard since we all know the rich and corporations will have theirs hear. A great and inspiring read."
4,good bars,"Good tasting and plenty of protein. Only problem is it's a little high in fat, but they all are..."
2,Did NOT like this show.,It was very juvenile and I couldn't get into the characters. I thought I might like it from the description and while the drawing style is fantastic it's just not a good show. The characters are very immature and it's kind of a weird relationship they all have with one another. I wouldn't recommend it.
4,"""Antietam 1862"" Meets The Test!","I found this book to be one of the best in covering the Battle of Antietam in a general form. In order to study the battle with more detail one must select those available as to individual units, armies or individuals.The publisher, Osprey Publishing,has provided an excellent and attractive format. Mr. Norman Stevens is to congratulated on this his first publication at least with this publisher. The details such as maps, illustrations and list of units in ""Order of Battle"" are excellent.I would recommend this book for any student of the war."
4,Antietam 1862: The Civil War's Bloodiest Day (Campaign),"Very detailed documentation of the Antietam campaign. I found many facts that were absolutely amazing, for the Civil War buffs this is a good read."
3,Redeeming genius.....but almost too late.,"Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane! Honey! Did you improvise this entire album? The free style jazz sound doesn't work as well as you might think with your beautiful words, which are, thankfully, placed in glory in the song ""Oh My, My"" which last 25 minutes! (Not a moment too long or short for me) Thank heavens for ""Honeybee"", ""Maria"", and ""Lovin' Cup""! Otherwise, I might never have stayed through to the end and heard the magic that is Siberry!Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane! You are so gifted, it's hard for me to find fault with your work, but with this album, I did. The differing styles from song to song clash like nails on a chalkboard. I know the flow you were going for, but I was tossed around like a wave jumper. Once again, though, ""Oh My, My"" helped ease the pain, and reminded me why the sun sets in your eyes."
3,Siberry tangos with jazz-nouveau,"Siberry's last release with Reprise reocords before starting her own Sheeba records. An innovative art-pop-jazz infusion that her old fans will love--quirky, cartoonish and daring. A few hard to swallow pieces that grow on you with time. Otherwise, refreshing and fun with Siberry's typical tender-sweetness and bitter seriousness. Not a serious album, but seriously played. The twenty minute ""Oh My My"" recalls ""When I Was a Boy"" rapture. Fun and fleeting, nothing like you'll ever hear."
4,Fun start to a new mini-series!,"Leonard thoroughly delights . . . 4 stars~~Romantic Times!Tina Leonard kicks off her new series, Cowboys by the Dozen, with FRISCO JOE'S FIANCEE (4). An ad for a housekeeper placed by the eldest of 12 Jefferson brothers brings more trouble than he bargained for-and more than Frisco, the second oldest, thinks they need. A passel of women shows up for the position, including Annabelle Turnberry and her infant daughter. Much as Frisco tries to protect his heart, this woman and baby quickly get under his skin. In this story reminiscent of ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"" Leonard thoroughly delights.Also recommended: LAREDO'S SASSY SWEETHEART, RANGER'S WILD WOMAN, TEX TIMES TEN"
4,Best succinct guide to SE MN streams,"This 'little book', in its second edition, provides the trout fisher with a concise guide to some favorite streams of the ""Driftless Area"" of Minnesota. Limestone spring creeks abound. John's years of exploring the back roads and small streams is distilled into a straightforward guide to both the most popular fishing spots, and some sleepers. It will save the novice a lot of time that might otherwise be wasted fishing unproductive water."
5,"Thorough, fascinating, inspiring","This book covers many facets of this amazing outdoor dance of harmony between Earth, Sun, the Cosmos, Humanity, and Divinity. It includes the music, excellent photographs, and clear explanations of the outer and inner aspects of this practice. One note of caution: It is not feasible to learn Paneurhythmy just by reading this book. The best way is to do it with others. But the book will give you a flavor of this practice, and help someone with Paneurhythmy experience to dive into its depths."
1,Blank CD,"Neither my mac nor my CD player was able to find anything on the disc. I was disappointed; and later, pleased to find this very recording available for free download online. It is beautiful to move to. It's a shame the artists cannot be appreciated through this purchase."
5,A very enjoyable book. Easy to read,"I found this book in a book fair in Washington DC. I never suspected that this book was going to be one of the best fiction books I have read. Balbeer Rao, through his memoirs, takes us to a grand journey across India meeting all kind of peoples (Holy men, exotic concubines, royal families, the feared Thuggee) and living all kind of adventures.In this book Andrew Ward presents a very vivid image of India on the time of its independence. He describes the land as he describe the people in all their splendor and traditions. Read it!"
5,A realistic and comforting book,"I sat down in my favorite chair in the living room intending to spend only about 15 minutes with it because that's all the time I had, and I couldn't put it down. Finished reading it later when I woke up with insomnia. It was a comforting book, one I wish I had had years ago. The realistic tone is a gift. Most intriguing were the end-of-chapter comments from the author's children."
4,A Wise Book,"I really love this book. I'm in agreement with many of Susan Vogt's thoughts, but even if I weren't, her even-handed approach to her subject matter and her respect for her readers would impress me. Anyone looking for insight into helping their children to become adults of integrity, self-discipline, and compassion will find lots of wisdom here. The inclusion of her own children's perspectives is a delightful bonus. And Susan V's daughter Heidi is a fine writer (must be genetic!)."
5,Raising Kids Who Will Make a Difference,"This is one of the most insightful and practical books on parenting I've ever read. The blend of the Vogt family stories, as well as other families' perceptions make this book delightful and engaging. The honesty, sincerity and wisdom with which Susan Vogt writes present us with pragmatic, intentional and caring ways to ""be"" family. As a parent of young adult children, it was refreshing to be reminded that none of us parent perfectly!Linda MosesCo-President,National Association of Catholic Family Life Minsters"
4,"I LIKE ONE SONG FROM THIS WOMAN,JUST FORGOT THA NAME OF IT!!I DONT HAVE THIS ALBUM,I'LL GIVE 4 STAR'S BECAUSE SHE TURN ME ON!!!","BACK IN THA DAYZ,THIS WOMEN GOT MY EYE'S OPEN FROM HERE STRONG VOICE...PLUS HERE LONG HAIR SHE USE TO HAVE!!!!"
1,my step cousin alanis morsette--what i think of her music...,"well just cause im sort of family dosnt mean i gotta like her music. well sort of family more like step cousins. but i'll still admit her music is not that very good. the only good one is ""you outta know"" thats not even that good."
1,"It's You and Me, Bobo...","What makes Alanis such a treasure is the honesty of her convictions and her absolute allegiance to commoners everywhere. When she plaintively emotes ""I've got one hand in my pocket,"" you realize she could be singing about anyone."
3,It's not Courtney Love,"but Alannis really tries to get the angsty youth down pat. Appreciating the effort however, does not translate into appreciating the music.What she has in intention, she lacks in originality.That this former teenybopper was able to reinvent herself as an ""Alternative Rocker"" suggests that she is very talented, but not as authentically angry as her press club has made her out to be. There are several more artists Hole, Bikni Kill etc) who pull off the enraged woman thing much more sucessfully.In the throws of Alannismainia, I remember how the stations would play the canadian endlessly. Catchy at first, there are only so many times you can hear one of her songs before throwing up your hands to cover your aching ears. One of the happier days of my life was when the local radio station realized that moderation was everything."
3,"Decent Album, great price.","As I am a causal fan of the artist's album I purchased, I was hesitant to pay for price for the album. This is why I decided to buy through this vendor, the CD was in good shape and came with the original artwork booklet but lacked the case. Besides that the shipping was fast and the price was right, solid 3 out of 5."
5,Jagged Little Pill,I did not have any problems with my order. It was delivered within reasonable time and in excellent condition! This has always been my favorite album. Thanks!
5,"Raw, Rich, Powerful, & IN-YOUR-FACE!",Wow - I just heard this CD at a friends house and I had to buy it for myself. An awesome voice and an awesome band - what more could a music lover ask for. Count me in as a member of the Alanis Morissette fan club. One bit of advice: Listen to this music at high volume.
5,Every song is great,"This is absolutely the first CD that I ever owned where I loved EVERY single song on it. Each song is great, and still I know the words to every song, even today."
5,"The most original, inspiring and emotional cd!","This cd covers so many different emotions, it is like a journal of Alanis' life that anyone can relate to. It shows that women are writing music that isn't just about love relationships, they feel comfortable discussing REAL issues. There are variety of different styles in one cd, I recommend this cd to anyone who wants to be moved and who wants to listen to an extremely talented Canadian artist with a powerful voice!"
5,More Than I Expected,"This CD is great! None of these songs sound alike! From the chilling ""Forgiven"", the story of Catholic girls being told what to do and doing it, to the outrageously wacked ""Right Through You"" where she sings ""Now that I'm Miss Thing/ Now that I'm a zillionaire/ You scan the credits for you're name and wonder why its not there"" Alanis seems to put a different side of her into each song, and it really sounds awesome! The best tracks are the ones that haven't been released publicly; ie: Perfect (my fav) Mary Jane (heartwrenching) Forgiven (Gives me shivers-the music and the words) Right Through You- (wow)This CD is worth every penny~ don't forget to listen for the a cappela song at the VERY end of this CD... PEACE y'all!"
4,The gift that keeps giving,"My daughter learned about Alanis Morrissette in her literature class and learned the song ""Ironic"". She loved the song so much that I purchased the cd for her as a christmas gift and she loves it!"
3,See her live...,"I received this CD with Supposed Infatuation Junkie (her 2nd) and concert tickets. Jagged is a mediocre album, the bright spot is ""Hand in my pocket."" That song along may be worth the cost of listening to the rest of this cd. Her concert was fabulous. Her 2nd album shines and shows real maturity, lyricism and honesty. I truly recommend it over this debut.As a side note, I was in a seedy little blues club in the lower east side in NYC, when a girl in the club requested to sing ""hand in my pocket"" on an acoustic guitar, solo. The band allowed her to play; it was a great experience to be there and was the highlight of the night. That song truly makes this album."
4,"Almost ""Perfect"".","If there was one album in the mid-90's, that said ""bye-bye"" to the whole alt-grunge scene, it had to be ""Jagged Little Pill"". Only No Doubt's ""Tragic Kingdom"" sounded as fresh at the time. Plus, this disc screamed ""Girl Power"" better, and before the ""Spice Girls"" did. It's one of those albums that's musically and lyrically awesome, and came out just at the right time. Also, in an album of all good songs, half of them are excellent. Besides the huge hits ""You Oughta Know"", ""Hand In My Pocket"", and ""Ironic"", this includes the songs ""All I Really Want"", ""Right Through You"", and ""Head Over Feet"". This will probably always stand as ""Alanis Morissette's"" best album, dont'cha think?"
1,Men badddd; woman gooood,"Geez, are there people who think Alanis has a good voice!!?? She doesn't know how to sing. Like many young male and female singers these days, she just sort of bellows and yells somewhat in tune. Her phrasing is terrible, all those yelps and whoops are annoying. Check out her vocal inflections on ""one hand in my pocket"" after the line, ""I've got one hand in my pocket"" the next line is ""the other one's hailing a taxi cab"" I can never hear that line without cringing. Her emotional level seems to be a jilted junior high student. ""You,you, you ....man, you!!!"" If you are over 25 and you think that her singing is great and her lyrics are really insightful, you need to check out more mature and much better singers like the late, great Eva Cassidy and maybe a country artist like Carlene Carter."
1,You oughta know this is overrated!,"I had to listen to this album constantly thanks to my college neighbors. All I can say is, it made me wince in pain on a daily basis. Isn't that ironic? Well no, really, it isn't. It's just a bad album. While her emotions may come across as sincere if you are used to listening to Tiffany, nothing can stop the chills I feel when I hear her high-pitched gargle-and-wail screechfest ""All I Really Want"". I recommend this album only as a torture device for cats who fight too much. It parodies them."
1,NOT A GOOD ALBUM,"ALANIS DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE. She is not good. Her annoyin,whining voice gets me ticked off. SO I don't hear it anymore. Instead you should buy the album of SHAKIRA."
3,"It's good, but not great.","What's the big deal about this album. It has probably just one great song (""hand in my pocket"") that is both ironic and subtle. The rest are simplistic banters."
3,OK,"There are a couple of good songs,but not enough to call this a great CD.I say,why waste your money?"
4,Great CD - some adult themes and language,"I love the CD. A lot of good hits are on the album like Head Over Feat, You Learn, Ironic and Hand In My Pocket as well as some great songs you rarely hear on the radio like Not The Doctor, Wake Up, Right Through You, and You Oughta Know as well as a hidden song at the end of the CD on the 13th track after the remix of You Oughta Know and about 2 minutes of silence. However, there are some adult themes (particularly in You Oughta Know) and some obscenities throughout so I won't play it when my kids are in the car."
1,Buy Her Second Album Instead!,"This is awful! Please turn it off! Get a voice, get a better mood, get musical, Alanis! You should have put this one in the trashcan and released your second album right away, 'cause ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie"" is as brilliant as ""Jagged Little Pill"" is unbearable!"
5,True Music,Alanis is a very good artist. This album shows that this artist is here to stay. This may very well be the best debut album in modern history. She sings like a true pro. This album is a must have for anyone that loves music.
2,Alanis Morissette is too self-absorbed,"I bought this CD in 1996, bought all the singles, then realized, after purchasing her new album, that Alanis Morissette has nothing better to do than write about her love life. Come on Alanis, find some other issues to pursue. However, I do love her voice."
3,Mood music,"Alanis Moriesette presents us with a poser. Either you will love her honest singing style, or you will think she wails like a banshee. I'm still straddling the line myself. Her songs have some genuine hooks (though the fuzzy production is overrated) and emotion. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, she doesn't know the full meaning of irony, nor does she present a context for it; the chorus of ""Ironic"" might as well be ""and isn't irony ironic - if I knew what it was."" However, the B-part of that song (""life has a funny way..."") is to die for. ""You Oughta Know"" is, well, pretty pissed off. ""All I Really Want"" is an amusing self-parody of a vocal performance. ""Head Over Heels"" is positive, but the harmonica solo seems ill-timed and oddly out of place. I dunno about all this. I guess it depends what mood you're in."
5,Best CD by a female artist!!!!,"FOr any of you that don't know, JLP is the number one selling album by any female artist in history, with over 30,000,000 sold. THis CD is phenomenal. Every song has it's own personality and everyone can relate to one song or another, whether it be ""you oughta know,"" which is primarily women's. ""Perfect,"" is for anyone with low self-esteem. Mary Jane, I believe is her personification of someone addicted to marijuana, which appeals to MANY people everywhere. Everyone ""has"" a song on the cd, so don't worry about liking it or not. Listen to everything and you'll like it all!"
5,A stunning debut,"Alnis has now proved herself to be one of the most exiting and contemporary artists in recent years. Whether you love or hate this album it was, and stil is hugely successful ( It was the biggest selling debut album of all time; it managed to shift 35 million copies). For me Alanis is perhaps one of the greatest songwriters of our time and her chilling and sometimes hauntin vocals prove both poignant and intensley moving. "" You Oughta know"" is an anthem of Alanis' pain. She draws from her own personl experiences and enables the listener to really feel the emotion behind the music. "" Forgiven"" is without doubt the stand out track from this album. I am sure that this album will continue to be successful and in my mind it will go down in history as one of the all time greats."
5,only the weak disagree,"This album is an anthem to female rockers everywhere. Alanis' poetic mind and creative sound mixing is incredible. Angry, honest and unapologetic, I think Alanis deserves two giant thumbs up. This is the album of the 90s and I am glad I've had the pleasure of listening to her music for all these years."
3,Some good some bad,"This is an okay CD. Just okay because I realized that each and every time I hear a song from it on the radio I get more and more tired of it and I usually turn it off. My least favorite song is Jagged Little Pill, she overdoes that little voice thing that she does, I can't describe it but I'm sure somebody knows what I'm talking about. But favorites are her breakthrough, You Oughta Know and Head over Feet which is my second favorite of hers after Uninvited. I'm looking very forward to the release of her next CD and future songs after hearing Uninvited."
4,Great CD!,Alanis makes you feel like your problems aren't as bad after listening to her songs. And that's a good thing. . . I guess!
5,jagged little pill,I love the cd and would recommend it to anyone. The case was delivered smashed and crack though. Might want to beef up your handleing along with your shipping. Thanks!!
2,A Bitter Pill to Swallow?,"Apart from 'Mary Jane' and 'Ironic', the tracks on this album sound like a recording session way out of control. Morrisette's voice is powerful sure, the lyrics are stark, but...SO WHAT? Frankly I'm sick to death with albums that are supposedly trying to make statements about society or life but are only out to make a buck. Still, Gen-X will buy it and rave about it and miss out on a lot of better music.."
1,"Please Alanis, GROW UP.","Alanis's albums could be a whole lot better if she realized she can't sing. Or play. Or write. Alanis was, what, around 22 when she made this album? You'd think she would have grown out of this 10th grade mentality by then. If mindless bitching about men and life is what you want, by all means, go for it. But people who appreciate real writing and real music know she's not worth it. The lyrics are meaningless, the music is drivel, and the singing is like fingernails on a blackboard. I wish she'd look up the meaning of ""irony"" also, because the song Ironic has no real irony in it."
2,It seems awful contrived,"Alanis Morissette takes advantage of a nineties market ripe for a young woman with an angry, edgy sound on ""Jagged Little Pill."" Morissette was a Tiffany-like teen pop sensation in Canada in the eighties before she became someone with a chip on her shoulder that the rest of the world should know about. This is not to mention that she co-wrote many of the tunes on ""Jagged Little Pill"" with a songwriter who worked with the likes of Madonna and Wilson Phillips. While there are some catchy melodies, Morisette will probably never be mistaken for a great vocalist. Will her sound change to take advantage of the next musical trends?"
1,HORRID!,"Alanis Morissette has one of the most horrid voices I have ever heard -- it sounds like someone who is being jabbed with a pitchfork. Her angst-filled lyrics(which are co-written by someone else, by the way) smack of commercialism. Many people fail to realize this album was a blatant example of an artist trying to reposition herself with little regard for musicianship (not that Morissette has any -- the only insturment she plays is the harmonica). She does have an occasionally catchy sense for grunge-pop melodies but otherwise this album has little to recommend it. Morissette can't sing, she writes crappy, self-indulgent lyrics and lacks musicianship. Hmmmm....."
3,it was a huge CD in the 90's,it was a really big CD and she was all over the place in 1995 and 1996 but i honestly think the singles that were released were the only good songs though she's a good writer and all.
3,a good cd,this album used to be one of my favorites but it gets old fast you can only hear Ironic so many times before you hate it i still listen to this cd sometimes but it is only ok
1,Can I give it negative stars?,"Two HUGE thumbs down for this one. Listening to this girl attempt to sing is like listening to a mangy, sick alley cat attempt to get its leg free from being caught in a fence. And her lyrics! Geez, we wrote better, more insightful stuff than that in my high school creative writing class.I mean, this is supposed to be a joke, right? Except that Alanis is the only one laughing -- all the way to the bank. Popular music is in such ridiculous shape these days."
2,bad copy,I am totally disappointed by the CD provided from this seller. the CD stopped playing after the 3rd song. I replayed it and it stopped after the 4th song.
5,Definitely her best,"While her subsequent CD was quite good, this one stands out as the best and most creative in my view. I listen to this CD while working out, driving down the autobahn (my favorite place to listen), or relaxing at home. It's among those I simply never get tired of."
5,classic,"I bought this CD in something like 5th grade, and even though I'm much older now, all of these songs remind me of when I was young enough not to have much to worry about and could just do what I wanted to. Alanis's music symbolizes individuality, and every song on this CD is great. Anyone who doesn't like this CD must not be able to remember some time in their life when they weren't willing to conform, and I think these songs, especially ones like Mary Jane, Perfect, and Ironic, are evidence of having difficulty in life and not always knowing what to do."
5,This rocks!,"I have to applaud Alanis for this totally awesome collection of songs. I've never really been into this kind of music, but I heard my friend's cd, and I had to have it. ""Oughta Know"" really lets me relate, because I know what she's going through. Way to go, girl!"
3,Alanis is... OK.,"Not one of the best CDs I've ever owned. I bought it for the songs of hers on the radio. However, thoughs were the only songs I liked - I found the others to be fillers. Even so, there are many good songs on the album.My favorites are ""Hand in my Pocket"", ""Head Over Feet"", and ""Ironic"". Listsening to her lesser known songs, ""Perfect"" and ""Mary Jane"", pritty much explains why they are lesser known.Some people say that Alanis Morrisette is a ""whiny"" artist, I'd have to say that I agree, but ""Jagged Little Pill"" is still a good CD."
5,A Masterpiece,"Alanis Morissette is one of the best poets & artists of this decade, from the opening ""All I really want"" and the angst driven ""You oughta know"" you can feel the power of her amazing vocal abilities and the sincerity by which she comes across. This album is a masterpiece. ""Hand in my pocket"" is a powerful song that blasts through the speakers with classic and artistic written all over it. It's a song in which Alanis wieghs the pros and cons of her personality I suppose but manages to describe just about everyone who is alive. There are many strong points here but the one I feel most strongly about and is Mary Jane,this song has feeling, from the opening guitar strings, the highs and lows, I truly feel Alanis gave her best vocal performance on this song ... so many reasons to purchase this album, Jagged little Pill is one of the greatest rock albums EVER, go pick it up"
5,Great CD!!!,"I must say that this is one of the best CD's of the 90's. After hearing the song ""Ironic"", I purchased this CD not knowing that I was in for a pleasant surprise. Other highlights are ""You Oughta Know"", ""Right Through You"", ""Head Over Feet"" and ""Mary Jane"". The whole CD is Awesome."
5,ALANIS IS AWESOME- THIS CD SAVED MY LIFE!,"Alanis is too good. She is simply the best no matter what anyone says. This was my first CD, now I have 120something (15 of them are Alanis ones) but still this one remains the first in my CD case and my ALL TIME FAVORTIE!!!!! I listened to this CD over a ZILLION times and still it is there in My 3 Disc chager Stero system. Some people say Alanis ""whines"", well her whining has meaningful and powerful messages!!!! The ""whinning"" in track 13 (secert verision of U outta now) is the best, when you hear it, it is more powerful than her awesome lyrics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the songs are great and have their own flavor! I love Alanis, but it really depends on how you feel when you listen to this, how you react.....you understand that? Once I riped it out of my CD player and broke it because the lyrics were to moving and 2 real for me to listen to, this can be dangerous but BUY THIS CD IT IS AMAZING!!!!!!! LOVE YOU ALANIS"
5,Absolutely fabulous.,"Alanis' lyrics are biting. I am amazed at the insight that she has at such a young age. I could listen to ""All I Really Want"" endlessly."
3,Alanis needs some anti-depressants,"I thought it was a cool CD full of anger and hatred. But What really got to me was that Alanis was really depressing, her music didn't have even an ounce of positivity in it. Well there are some good songs like Head Over Feet, and Hand In My Pocket but those songs were so overplayed at least for me whenever I heard them they made me sick. I did like the song Perfect it reminds me of my own life its a great song but the CD needs some work. As for Alanis I have nothing against her I think shes great she just makes me feel melancholy when I listen to her songs."
3,Angst that sold well!,"Alanis really paved the way for angst-ridden females to strut their stuff. Relying mainly on the angst she had, Alanis broke many platinum records and sold 25 million of her debut album no less.What's probably amazing is how well the album combined angst with rock and pop that's undeniably catchy. Alanis and Glen created a blend of songs that managed to make u think a little while jiving and singing along to. With such hits like You Oughta Know, Hand In My Pocket, Head Over Feet and You Learn, another rarely used gem is the harmonica that Alanis use to pretty good effect.The highlight on this album must be the song Ironic. Funny, poignant and starkingly honest all at once. Though slighly unpolished, the delivery here is almost impeccable.The disadvantage of selling so much for someone so new is the amount of venom spit by critics, but to all critics, listen to Junkie, it's much more mature and polished......."
4,Good Record - worth the money,"I bought this a long time ago after hearing 'You Oughta Know' once on the radio. The station didn't play it much afterwards, and she seemed to go away. So I had the CD and liked it for several weeks before everyone else got it. Althought it wasn't what I was hoping for (a CD full of loud, angry songs), it was worth getting.My opinions of the songs, when they were just track numbers on a CD, before everyone in the world heard them:Track 1: A good song, although not as good as You Oughta Know T2 : The best song on the CD, the reason why I got it T3 : didn't like it at first, but kind of grows on you T4 : HORRIBLE SONG, skip the song, or better yet program it out T5, T6: very good. The two best 'other' songs T7 : kind of filler, but not bad T8 : another song that kind of grows on you T9 : a non descript song that I sometimes skip T10, T11 : two songs that are kind of filler, 11 better than 10 T12 : a good closer. I don't care for the a capella song, though."
3,GET A DICTIONARY,"Did alanis get a dictionary before she wrote ''Ironic''?No I don't think so!Let me tell you somthing ''Ironic'' was a very popular song in 1996 but when alanis wrote it she used ''Ironic'' in the wrong way!She was very close to using the word correctly.Alanis sold like,over ten billion records and a lot of those people made fun of her for using the word ''Ironic'' in the wrong way.They didn't think it was proper.So befor you buy this,think twice!"
5,Alanis: The Beatles of the 1990s,"Wake up, people. The future of rock music has arrived and she is a 5 foot, four inch Canadian woman from Ottawa. Jagged Little Pill jumps out of the speakers and directly into your heart."
2,Shipping was SLOW!,"It took more than a week for The Jagged Little Pill CD to be delivered to us. I can't believe the lag in delivery time, especially since it was shipped from NYC to Syracuse, NY."
1,One star is too much,"This CD sucks. i mean come on! Women freak out too much - alanis is all pissed women arent treated right - is us men had to put up with any more s#it from women, WE would be the ones complaning. the only morissette fans are women because they dont know any good music. go check out rob zombie or white zombie for some good music."
1,Oh The Depth Of It All,"Until a listen of this cd I never truly understood anguish, pain, and authenticity. Morrisette is an artist of the highest caliber. Reaching inside the depths of her soul to produce music that allows mere mortals a glimpse into the heart of genius. Thank you Alanis for having the courage to put the struggles of growing up in suburban Ottawa as a provincial Tiffany child star into this masterpiece. The realism of those mean streets that you survived only serve to make your art more credible. Even the name Jagged Little Pill (and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie too) is charged with an energy that is free from all posturing and posing. The best that music has to offer. NOT!!!!!!!!"
5,Easy Pill To Swallow,"This is another classic album, ""Jagged Little Pill"" for me is in the same category as ""Come On Over""-Shania Twain, ""Sheryl Crow""-Sheryl Crow, ""Let It Loose""-Gloria Estefan and ""Music""-Madonna, it hooks you in and you can not stop listening to it like those album previously mentioned I all but wore this album out as well. Songs like ""You Oughta Know"", ""Right Beside You"", ""All I Really Want"", and ""Head Over Feet"" were just the tip of the iceberg, but the gems of this album are ""Hand In My Pocket"", ""You Learn"", and finally ""Ironic"", but also ""Not The Doctor"" I just basically name every song that is because every song on this album like the others mentioned had songs that for every one of them could have been released."
4,She is a very angry singer,"I really liked Alanis' album, theonly thing that bugged me was that she is so angry in a lot of her songs, most of them. I hope she's not relating to her life. That's sad. But overall the album is really good."
4,I really appreciate her work!,Alanis is really cool! She talks about pain and sorrow in many peoples lives. I really enjoy her music!
5,Best CD of all Time!,"Alanis Morissette is absolutely amazing. Every song on this CD is an instant classic. This has been my favorite album for 10 years. I highly recommend the acousitc 10 year anniversary edition that just came out on June, 14, 2005. This edition is fantastic. This is just as good if not better than the original. She is not as angry and bitter as she was in the original. I recommend both editions for whatever mood you are in!"
2,A very disappointing record.,"One strong song (""You Oughta Know"") and very little else. I bought it as soon as it came out and stopped playing it after the first couple of weeks. AM's voice lacks strength and her songwriting pales beside Liz Phair's. Any of the latters records are much better."
5,"best ""chick rock"" album so far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Alanis shows great vocal and lyrical talent in this release. Yes I am male but the man hater label that has been put on this album is misleading. I like every song without exception(although I did have to stop playing ironic because I got sick of it).
5,A pain-filled effort with alot of emosion.,This CD is rated close to the top on my CD rack because of the deep strength in her voice and the fact that it is so depressing it makes me feel better about my life. I am really looking foward to her next CD to come out. I hope the next cd has the same strength and passion that this one had. I only hope she uses her natural vioce more than the crying screams. Over all it is a respectable cd and would be a great cd to add to a wide musical ranged collection.
5,A Voice Of A Generation,This album is a voice for a generation and I was a part of that generation. It's my favorite cd in my collection and a true gem and everyone need to pick up this cd to see what all the fuss was about. The song a wonderderful from start to finish and I wouldn't wanted any other way. The rawness of her voice and how she sings each song it wonderful. She pave the way for artist like P!nk because before P!nk their was Alanis. She will always be the one true rocker of the 90's if you ask me.
5,A pure classic look back into the 90's,"Raw, pure, talented, this CD has them all in it, it may as well be a ""best of"" on it's own."
4,Good 90's CD,"This is one of the best cd's of the 90's. All the songs are good. Sometimes she's just a little to angry, and other times, the music is a little too slow. Anyway there are a lot of great songs on here, so check it out."
5,Anyone working/studying in early childhood NEEDS this book,"The book is straightforward, authoratative and easy to read. The authors are not ivory tower academics: they have had plenty of hands-on experience. As a college/university textbook it should be compulsory reading. As a professional text, it is a necessary purchase."
4,Quality Infant Toddler,This book gives you the skinny on what is important for the care of infants and toddlers. Then it provides detail for creating the experiences that make all the difference. A perfect book for the beginner and to expand the expertise of the seasoned caregiver.
5,Should be more popular,"I don't know why this book isn't more popular. Grammar and usage is about language, and language is about communication. The style of language you use either distracts from or contributes to communication, so you tune your language to your reader or listener. In other words, correct usage depends on context. While certainly not a comprehensive reference, this book provides valuable insights to those of us who tend to be overly compulsive about formal grammar. Recommended."
5,Going to Brainville,"Lips at thier finest. I'm not quite sure why this album seems to be the ""forgotten album"" by the lips. It's just a great collection of catchy, fun, and sonically wonderful songs. I guess you need a ""concept"" nowadays to be on the ""top of lists""Every song on this album is highly enjoyable, and WILL provide hours of enjoyment."
2,Wasn't too impressed,"Well, I read the good reviews, took a chance on this record, and came out disappointed. Some of the music was OK, but I didn't find anything spectacular about it. Actually, I was a bit annoyed by the slightly off-key whiny vocals, and I thought a lot of the lyrics were just plain stupid. I can usually overlook problems such as these if the music is good, but it sounds sloppy to me and no better than average. I rate this 2 to 2-1/2 stars, good for about 2 repeated listens."
5,In their own,"The Flaming Lips have to be one of the most imaginative bands there is out there, in every aspect of 'being a band.' The song-names and warped and wry and melancholy all at once, the lyrics follow from there but are audibly understandable, the mix of synth-sound and guitars and all the whole damn soundscape orchestration is incredibly diverse and unique, a voice of its own, but incredibly, still have an underlying pop sense that makes it totally mostly accessible, their band name, 'the flaming lips', rocks, their concerts are always changing and different from what any body else does,...pant, this is a true 'art' band, in every way, merticulous over every part of what they are, and you have to appreciate that versatility, and the flair to actually pull it off and show themselves as a true original, on Rocking!"
3,"What's the matter, getting too old?","Worthy effort, still a fair amount of melody with a few songs that really stand out. But still by no means comparable with the previous albums, lacking those catchy and upbeat hard rock tunes that make you just want to keep listening to it over and over again. And it progressively gets worse after this, so unless you're into contemporary easy listening on the radio, do yourself a favor and make sure you don't get anything that was released after this album."
3,"too complicated, too British","Nothing against the British... but as Americans, our family did not relate to many of the clues in this game. They're references to pop culture, history and even geography with which we're not familiar. I should have realized this when I bought it from a seller in England; it's certainly not the seller's fault, but I wish the product listing would have mentioned that. Perhaps there are two versions?Also, Bendy Bob could have been more... bendy. His arms and legs are just fabric; I thought they'd have wire running through them, so he could hold a shape.I was really looking forward to playing this game, as we enjoy Taboo and the format sounds like a winner. However, the various categories and scoring differences are too complicated to be intuitive and fun. I paid way too much for a game that's going to collect dust on the shelf."
1,HORRIBLE,I truly did not enjoy this effort. I gleaned no further insight into the character that is Mark Messier. I wanted to at least hear about his personal life and all of the super models that he socialized with
2,Hard to Follow,I have tons of exercise dvds and this one is way too hard to follow. I get lost in all the steps and moves and I don't have trouble with my other dvds. Stick will Jillian Michaels or Jackie Warner.
4,Pretty good workout!,"I actually enjoyed this dvd alot. I got the book and liked it so much I was curious to get the dvd as well too. I would say my level of fitness is about intermediate to advance and I think this dvd does pretty well catering to different levels. Workouts are short but effective, a great workout to do when you are short on time. This is a good one to keep in your workout dvd collection."
5,Kicked my ass!,"I love Jessica Smith and her workouts. She is clear in queing and very like-able. This workout kicked my butt! You will definitely look better naked if you do this. I bought the book to go with it but it was really a waste, just get the dvd and have a sensible diet with it."
5,BEST WORKOUT DVD!!!,"THIS IS THE BEST WORKOUT DVD I HAVE USED THAT IS DESIGNED ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN. THE INTERVAL EXCERCISES HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED FOR ME. NOT ONLY IS THERE WEIGHT LOSS, BUT THERE IS CORE STRENGTHENING AND OVERALL STRENGTH TO THE BODY. IT ALSO TONES AT THE SAME TIME YOU LOOSE WEIGHT. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT."
3,Easy Glide Cutter falls off the box.,"This plastic wrap comes without the cutter attached to the box of plastic film. There is an adhesive strip on the cutter and you need to press it on the box. Unfortunately this adhesive does not work very well and the cutter falls off every time I use the wrap. Hopefully I can glue it on with something because without the cutter I am going to have to trash this as there will be no way to cut the film. Also I was hoping the texture of the film would be like the Reynold's Plastic Wrap that is no longer available in supermarkets. It does not even come close. On the plus side, it is a huge roll of wrap for the price and it arrived very quickly."
5,Very good!,"The sort of book that will leave you putting it down, finished, at 3am or so. Well written and edited."
5,Excellent!,Perfect for carrying the essential tools to any situation. Incredibly comfortable handle to pick up the tools no matter the weight. Glad I got it!
2,"Holds stuff, but not durable","I purchased this after one of my other tool totes was wearing out. I am a HVAC/Temperature Control professional .Positive notes:It Holds quite a bit of tools/gearShoulder strap helps when going up ladders.InexpensiveNegative notes:Storage Pockets aren't very deepScrewdrivers don't stay straight in loopsShoulder strap always seems to lay underneath toolsStitching on outer pockets tearsTools end up lying underneath handleBottom line - seems ok for occasional home use, but wouldn't recommend it for professional daily use."
4,Light weight yet sturdy product,This is a very usefull tool tote that is well constructed. Its strong but suprisingly light. I would of given it five stars if it had a few more side pockets.
3,Not as tough as I thought,"This bag is just about the perfect size for me at work. It holds plenty of what I regularly use and then some. However, it is not as durable as I hoped it would be. There are already small rips and seams splitting; the cushion grip has torn and the tape holder 'D"" ring broke off. I still use it but I have a feeling I will need a new bag in about a month."
3,Okay Product.,"This Tote is okay, but there are better ones out there for the price. I returned it and purchased a Stanley Tote. The Stanley Tote was taller (which is handier for screwdrivers)and sturder made on the bottom. For a lttle more money, I was also able to get some very nice tools which were included with the Stanley Tote."
4,Good tool bag,"This is a nice tool bag/box. I like the open top because its easy to see tools and find what you need. Handle is easy to carry and padded. Bag is made in China so we'll see how long it lasts. They could have put alot more pockets on it, only one side has pockets, so there is limited space for small tools. The bag is very rigid but if you load it up with heavy items, the bottm does sag. Overall I like it. It's almost identical to the one made by Craf**man but this one is cheaper."
5,Just the right size...,"I purchased this guy just to carry my lightweight handheld power tools when I need to haul them around. Nowadays, I just leave one of my cordless drills in there with some essentials (i.e. - pliers, screwdrivers, bits, rulers, etc)I usually just toss in whatever else I need & then just go. This bag has a hefty feel to it & the nonmar feet are definitely great around marble tiles & countertops... spacewise, you could fit two drills and still have a bit of room to pile stuff ontop of them if needed."
3,Football Lite,The book was alright. If you are looking for a detailed history of the Steelers and Bradshaw's career you will most likely be disappointed. The book focusses more upon funny stories off of the field.
5,He's a Funny Guy!,Gotta love Terry Bradshaw! He's really lovable and entertaining to read. I have read two of his books and he keeps me laughing. His books cover his football experiences as well as his life challenges. Can't decide which of his books to buy? Get more than one! You can't go wrong with Terry!
4,Overlooked jazz guitarist with swing and taste,"A worthy, but little known successor to the rapidly diminishing greatest generation of jazz guitarists. Heard Mark play by chance on Pandora. One taste, and I was a fan."
5,Russell J. Schultz,"The title cut is alone, is a 'musical aphrodesiac'!! Put it on, take the phone off the hook, curl up on the couch with your soul-mate,...!!! They don't call themselves 'Fourplay' for nothing!!! Great to listen to on a cruise to the Bahamas!! Ultra smooth and ultra romantic!! The ladies ALWAYS love this one!!!"
5,Nice...,"I have been a Fourplay fan for years. Great album, nice grooves, fun sound....check it out if your are a fan."
5,Your Cd player will LOVE You,"This is a true gem. The production quality here is superb, the bass is nice and low and on even a mediocre system it feels the room beautifully. Very good cuddle music in front of a fire, under a blanket with that special someone,(or someone you are trying to convert to 'special'). I love this CD, I use to play this Cd at my retail sales job to sell audio systems.Ervin"

4,Wonderful story of life within a working floating liner!,"Bare bones account of life on a great liner. Comming up in the ranks of the merchant marines is depicted well. The officer humbles himself alongside his ship Queen mary. It shocked me because it was such a relaxing informative read. A book that depicts what only an officer aboard a liner could ever have known From nights in the Pig and Whistle to just about every event behind the seens. Just a wonderful experience.!!! *Also: I am a liner buff- please contact me about collecting, buying items, big or small!!"
3,Old technology but maybe this is what you want,"Although this book has a copyright date of 1996, the newest engine data I could find was 1987. It is a good reference for crate engine suppliers (I assume most are still in business) and general selection information. It is heavy on race/hotrod/performance applications but has info applying to daily drivers also. And it has a chapter on preparation and startup of the engine. It discusses carburetors, and ""old fashioned"" distrubutor ignitions with vacum advance. If you are looking for data on updating your 90's GM truck to a modern Vortec (like me), this is NOT the book to get. There is no info on using modern ignition/engine management systems. Nor any data on throttle body or fuel injection. There is no data on engine mount fitment for swapping older/newer engines into vehicles."
5,Simple Elegance,"The most amazing thing about this book is that it manages to be so much and remain simple.The poems are deep. Insights into the author's feelings about: her mixed heritage, her parents, her mother's death, the American South,The Native Gaurd, everyday life.I like the extensive research she put into this as well as hearing her own distinct voice shine through (literally with her reading her poems on the CD) and through her writing style.This would make an amazing gift to a friend, teacher, or family member. But the real gift is in reading/listening to the poems.The book is just under 50 pages long, but it leaft me with a heavy feeling of satisfaction and the quizical mindset I get after reading thought-provoking, heartfelt poetry."
5,beautiful,this collection was very moving. it is almost like reading an auto-biography. the images and metaphors are clear and striking. the book arrived in good time.
5,A thought provoking read.,"As I read these poems, each offers a an insight which calls me to visualize the scenes that are portrayed. I've reread several passages to confirm their impact.This book is great example of powerful modern poetry. I'll recommend it to many. it offers a profound mix of history and personal experience. Trethewey reveals her life and thoughts fearlessly."
4,Works as described,Used this on the door between the basement and the kitchen - easy to install - doing with it is described to do.
5,Door Sweep,My husband had been looking for the broom type door sweeps forever. When I found this one on Amazon it was a dream come true. The rubber ones just didn't seem to stop the little lizards from crawling under our screen door but the broom sweep works just fine. Thanks a bunch.
5,Makes all the difference,"Due to settling, our door sill is not even. Contractors installed the door plumb, but this left an irregular gap underneath through which the winter wind would just blow. Installed this sweep on the inside of the fiberglass exterior door in about fifteen minutes. Trim to length with a hacksaw, mark the screw holes, drill small pilot holes, and screw in, tightening only after you've started all the screws. Yesterday you could feel the icy wind blowing under the door and moving the curtains. Now, nothing. Wish I'd known about this earlier, can't imagine how much I would have saved on heating bills."
5,Easy and works!,"Thankfully an ex had left a set of tin snips behind, so I was able to measure and cut to the correct length. So far this thing is doing it's job, and not falling apart like vinyl or rubber would. Love it. A little air still seems to pass through at one section, but that's due to my threshold being so unlevel, and not a problem with the product. I like the fact that it screws in versus being taped on. I know it's going to stay put."
5,Right product if the door is not exactly alighed.,Used on my basement door. The brush allows for slight variation in the gaps when the door is open. Very useful product even for indoor use.
3,Blues Dues and Love News,"I do not know why I expected for Maxine to sing the blues. I did not care for most of the songs she chose. I have always liked her voice and style. I shall not give up on her, however, next time I shall pay more attention to the songs."
3,Works but can dry out.,This product works but you have to use it frequently and it will dry out if you forget to replace the lid.
5,true to describtion,"This CD was not only amazing music, but the condition was true to description, Thanks"
4,good old boney,Better tahn his latest issue.True boney fans will already have this in there box but for those just discovering 'seek out'.
4,"Boney James, Seduction is a great CD!","The soft melodic rhythms and the sensual sound of the sax make ""Seduction"" an appropriate name for this CD. I just wanted more!!!!"
1,Product size is listed incorrectly,"The binder is listed as a 11"" X 8-1/2"" . It is incorrectly listed and I have notified the company it came from. If I wanted an 8 1/2"" X 11"" binder I would of got one off of my shelf that I already have. It would cost me more to send it back than what it cost so therefore I spent money that I did not need to spend and have a binder I don't need."
5,The Great Kate,"If you'd like to see the human side of the great Katharine Hepburn, then you've come to the right place. This book is informative, entertaining, a breeze to read, and above all, where Kate is concerned, honest. This is definitive Hepburn."
3,Operation Mars,"Glantz is certainly a prolific authority on the eastern front. He tries to avoid a common problem with military histories, listing so many divisions and battalions that one's eyes glaze over, and he makes this book somewhat more readable than his earlier one on the Kharkov offensive by extrapolating the thoughts of the commanders involved. My main gripe with the book is that the places mentioned in relation to specific battles usually do not appear on the accompanying maps, and his chronology sometimes fails to lead logically to the unfolding of the battle scenario. At one moment we are reading about the exploits of a particular Soviet battle group, and the next moment we find, much to our surprise, that they have been cut off by a German counteroffensive that seems to have appeared out of nowhere. Still, Glantz shows the epic nature of the battles between the Soviets and the Nazis and makes us realize how much of World War II was fought almost beyond the range of our awareness."
4,Impressively thorough research and very well written.,"The book is a little hard going at first, but it rewards perseverance. It becomes engrossing after the first few dozen pages, and the author's research is absolutely astounding, when one considers that very little (if anything at all) is actually written about this war in other more popular works concerning the eastern front during WW2. Information about the battle that was fought at exactly the same time as this one, namely the battle of Stalingrad is easy to obtain. If however, the enquiring reader wishes to know what was happening in other sectors of the eastern front during the Stalingrad battle, then this is surely the book to read. The book is very detailed, but lots of maps are provided for assistance. Well recommended for the more serious WW2 enthusiast."
2,Too much detail,"This ought to to have been a ground-breaking book on the war in Russia, and the tenacity of Hitler's military machine.But the author seems to have no sense of what is important and what is speculation. The book is overloaded with unnecessary detail. Like most historians, Glantz is a big paragraph man.No one has ever told him that short paragraphs are easier to read.I fear in his case, even this slight modification would be of no help.A ruthless editor should get to work on it and cut through the verbiage to leave what's important.And other reviewers are right: the maps are appalling."
3,Good but...,"This is the second book of David Glantz I've read. The first was 'The Battle of Kursk'. This book is very detailed but only in the Russian side. I think that sometimes is useless to read about an unknown battle like this without have both german and russian orders of battle at hand. It's a good but not complete research. As a result I can only give 3 stars. Stalingrad, Kursk, Kharkov or Moscow are known battles but this not and it would be better to have all information available in an only book."
4,Love this group,"This contains both Barenaked Ladies Are Me & Barenaked Ladies Are Men, both in 5.1 surround sound. Disc 1 is better than disc 2, but there's good stuff on both. I particularly love the dreamy quality of ""Adrift"", ""Something You'll Never Find"", ""Home"", ""Half A Heart"", and the best track on the album, ""Maybe You're Right"". Steven Page has a terrific voice. Fun group!!"
4,They did it again,"The Barenaked Ladies are a fantastic band, and in this album they've done it again. Their quirky humor is mixed with ballads and songs that will make you laugh, and some that could even make you cry. I recommend it to anyone who likes Barenaked Ladies, or funky rock folky pop funk sounds."
2,Not So Hot,"I used to be a big BNL fan in the Stunt and Maroon days, but lately I think I've grown out of it. Their newest album seems somewhat uninspired, and the lyrics hint at triteness and depression. The tunes and chord progressions seem forced. The sweetness of ""Home"" is one of the album's bright spots, and the instrumentation on ""Everything Had Changed"" is entertaining, but in general, this one is a skip. Sorry, guys..."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I was less than thrilled with this album - not as upbeat as their previous albums. I'll have to give it several more listens, but I'd have to rank it as my least-favorite BNL disk."
1,BNL's first miss,"I'm a huge BNL fan, but this is one of the most lifeless, lackluster albums I've ever heard. I've loved all their albums, even E2E which received mixed reviews, but I don't understand what they were thinking on BLAM. I've forced myself to listen to the album four times and there's still not a single track that I actually wanted to listen to. ""Bank Job"" is arguably the strongest track, but even it got old after two listens. I never imagined such a brilliant band would put out such a boring album. Even their trademark witty lyrics are just limp and juvenile. What a total disappointment."
4,"If The Barenaked Ladies Are Me, I'm Doing Great!","Another fine release by the Barenaked Ladies. A fun, rocking, smooth flowing CD with plenty of songs that make their way nicely into your head, whether you expected it or not. No, it's not like their previous releases because in fact, it is not their previous releases, and it's fresh and and it's good, very good. It's also very much the Barenaked Ladies; add another star if you consider yourself a big fan of the Ladies. I would highly recommend this CD and recommend getting the other 14 songs released through I-tunes. Buy them both and play together, repeat and enjoy over and over."
4,Good but not their best,We like this album quite a bit but have to say it is not the Ladies' best. It seems to get better after you listen to it a few times though so give it a chance and it will grow on you.
4,Their smoothest flowing album yet,"The new album is probably their most consistent album they've made. The songs flow into each other wonderfully; nothing on the album is a jarring departure from the overall theme. While it lacks the darker edge of ""Everything to Everyone,"" the album instead focuses on the nostalgic and pleasant. It features the trademark wit the band is known for, but it's much more subtle. While it doesn't have the boundless energy of ""Gordon"" or the pop sound of ""Stunt,"" it is an album that demands to be listened to from beginning to end."
4,They get back on track,"This album is full of lush harmonies and easy going melodies that harken back to the ""Pet Sounds"" era, but they still remain BNL. Not as instantly catchy as Stunt or Maroon, but more infectious. Once you let it in, it's like a cozy little fire keeping you warm during a power outage in the middle of winter.Among the best songs are Adrift, Take it Back, and Everything Had Changed. They even let Jim Creegan get in on the fun as he wrote and sings ""Peterborough and the Kawarthas,"" an odd little ditty that is light without being pointless.This album has been a pleasant surprise for me this year."
5,"Includes both ""...Are Me"" and ""...Are Men""","DVD-audio release of Barenaked Ladies Are Me and Barenaked Ladies are Men (aka, Barenaked Ladies are Me Deluxe Edition). If you have a DVD-audio setup, this is the one to buy. All 29 songs, remastered in 5.1 sound. Just like the DVD-audio remix of ""Everything for Everyone"", this one isn't terribly obtrusive or gimmicky, just a nice separation of tracks and the extra clarity that comes from the extended range.Again, if you have the capability to enjoy it, pull the trigger and get this one."
3,A more mature 'Me',"Less whimsy, more serious sound, but still unistakenly BNL. Lyrics are typically intelligent and harmonies are terrific. Sound is similar to their work on 'Stunt', but more rooted in slower and midtempo songs, and less raucous tunes like 'Alcohol'. Jim Creeggan and Kevin Hearn continue to leave their mark, increasingly more so on 'BLAM'. Standout tracks include 'Bull In A China Shop', 'Peterborough & The Kawarthas' and 'Sound Of Your Voice'. Ed Robertson's guitar work is especially good on the new disc, and especially on 'Easy' and 'Wind It Up'. All-around solid effort ."
3,"Good lyrics, not the best melodies","As usual, BNL has some very good, beautifully written and interesting lyrics to their songs. However, this album is missing a fun, upbeat song which is what made me fall in love with the group in the first place. I'll listen to this album when I want to relax, but I guess I'll listen to some of their other albums when I want to have fun."
2,Not happy at all,"I am a big fan. I have seen the live shows. So the question remains - what went wrong here? There are a few great tracks - Bull in a China Shop, Easy, Take It Back and Bank Job. The problem is the rest of the tracks lack anything distinctive. There is nothing that makes you want to listen to the rest of the tracks. It is rather boring. The lead track is just slow and never develops. That is the problem with this cd. Where is the wit? And why is Kevin singing so much on this? I did not buy ""thin buckle"" or whatever his band is. The sad thing is the ""sister"" cd is not much better, in fact is worse.I hope they find their way again."
1,the end of an era,"I have been a BNL fan for years and i continue to buy anything with their name on it, but this last purchase seemed to lack the wit and charm of any of their other albums."
4,Helpful for shy moms,"This video was helpful in that it allowed me to broach a subjet with my very ""hip"" 10 year old that I didn't quite know how to address without alienating her."
3,"Good book, good time, a little awkward in spots.","Ms. Edwards did better work later, but this book is still charming and readable. I had to snicker through some of the depictions of fights and wounds, which did not convince me, and thought the sexual relationships showed the influence of too much lightweight romantic fiction and pop psychology. Still, the heroine is capable, intelligent, interestingly flawed and very likeable, and the plot and Ms. Edwards' inviting style keep you happily turning pages. Good light reading, good fun, and the good folks win in the end."
2,Later Platters?,"Had a Platters CD that I really listened to a lot. Then it started skipping. When I tried to reorder, it was not longer available. This CD had some of the same songs, so I ordered it. This CD sounds like a later version of ""The Platters""...other people. I listen to a few songs on it....but it definately is NOT the old group. Maybe ""Wannabees""..."
5,Better than the original carafe that came with the machine,"The carafe was well packaged, arrived on time and turns out...even better than the original. Our original Krups carafe did not have the band at the bottom - relying on a glued handle that did need re-gluing once before it was accidentally broken (hand washing). The new carafe was the exact same size (exactly as pictured)and works perfectly with our European Krups coffee machine (not the XS1500)."
4,"OK carafe, but be careful not to break it.","Just a normal glass coffee carafe, but we've broken two of them already. Be careful with it and I'm sure it will last forever."
4,As advertised...,"This pot was exactly like the one I had to replace, so it works just fine. So far it's help up, but the reason I replaced it in the first place is the other one seemed to break easily. Hopefully this one holds up well. Seems fine so far!"
3,"It's okay, not great","They are only a marginal improvement over my existing wiper blades. The old blades were 12 months old, so I was expecting more, but was mildly disappointed. It works fine, but isn't anything to write home about."
5,Marching Through Culpeper would make a great movie!,I hope a movie deal comes through. I think John Cusack would be wonderful as Constance's 'Yankee soldier' and pictured him as such as I was reading the book -- ALL THREE TIMES!!!
5,Thank You Mrs. Morton,"Born and raised in the North I was exposed in school only to the Northern point of view, ""Marching Through Culpeper"" was not only a very good read - one of the best books that I've ever read - but was also very informative about the South. I now have a much more balanced view. Thank Your Mrs. Morton"
4,History Comes Alive,Ms. Morton has woven a story that has incorporated the facts of the Civil War in a very readible and understandable fashion. Her book has given me a much greater appreciation of the issues and hardships of the war.
5,It rivaled Gone with the Wind and WON!,"Virginia Morton came to visit my college this semester to talk about Marching Through Culpeper and sold her book to me after a short introduction of the plot. Although we only had time to read Gone with the Wind this semester, I could not even wait a day after returning from college to start her book. I read the book in 2 days and could not believe how eloquently Virginia Morton had combined mostly nonfiction with fiction; I was captivated by the storyline and the characters from beginning to end. I have recommended this book to my whole family and wish that everyone would give this book a chance. I have a newfound interest in the Civil War and feel as though Virginia Morton taught me more Civil War history than any teacher ever has. PLEASE MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF MARCHING THROUGH CULPEPER!"
1,"Stitled, dry South","As a lover of historical fiction, I found MtP one of the reading disappointments of a long reading career. The language is so stilted , it's funny :""I am in awe of you."" ?? The idea may be good, the historical research thorough, but dry....dry....I am stopping my laborious reading at the point that the incredible young heroine meets the 6'2"" hero.....ENOUGH!!!!!"
4,Arrived intact and in good shape,"Although I read some negative reviews, I went ahead and ordered this rack. It arrived in relatively good shape, with some very minor blemishes on a couple of edges, but not enough to worry about. Was put together well, and was exactly as described."
4,We love it!,This wine rack is beautiful and functional. The only negative thing to report is that every single screw was either loose or laying in the bottom of the box. We don't really find that too troublesome as we double check everything we buy and we own a screwdriver! You truly cannot go wrong with this purchase. Excellent color and materials.
4,Beautiful piece.,"This is very elegant looking. A tad on the pricy side, but it looks great and appears sturdy. A nice show-piece."
2,Poor quality for the price,"I like the form factor and functionally. It holds 12 bottles just fine. If I had gotten this at a garage sale for $10, I would have been happy, but I paid enough for this that I was expecting a piece of decent workmanship. Instead, it arrived with some of the screws fallen out and rattling around in the box. The rest of the screws were lose. The stain is uneven. It looks ok tucked away in a dark corner, but if you put it in good light it looks like a 6 year old painted it. It doesn't sit evenly no matter which end I put down. If there aren't enough bottles on it to give a decent weight then it wobbles back and forth at a touch."
5,Very Solid Build,"I bought this wine rack as a wedding gift for my friend. I was a little bit skeptical about the quality since several of the reviews have mentioned about lose screws and poor paint job etc. However, the one I received was perfect!!! I took it out of the box to make sure nothing was wrong with it because I don't want my friends to think I give them a broken rack.It came in a nicely wrapped box. I was pretty impressed by the build quality. Very smooth edges and the color is beautiful. I definitely will recommend this to anyone that is looking for a unique design wine rack. Most likely I will get one for myself too.In addition, the price was nice! I saw similar design ones in the local store for almost triple the price."
1,broke in a week,"battery went dead in a week, I misplaced so I never got a refund...disappointed in life of watch"
5,Chill the stemware,"Mix a batch of very dry martinis, put on the sublime Miss Wiley, and experience pure pleasure. Her choice of material, phrasing technique and superb vocal quality all contribute to making this collection of her Columbia recordings an exquisite event. Night in Manhattan is especially brilliant..an evocation of a lost city."
2,Faulty parts.,"I don't know if Cateye has updated their product, but the steering mechanism that tells the controller when you are turning broke on both of the game bikes we bought after only 2 months use. And it was only being used like twice a week. We've now had the bikes for 2 years. The peddling still works, and nothing else has broken, so as a normal exersize bike, it's okay. But for gaming on it, those parts broke. We found out it was easier just to play on it with out having it hooked up to a controller. So, you might as well just buy a normal exercise bike."
3,Doesn't look like what I ordered...,"Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and the discus didn't look at all like the picture. No Nelco brand name, no Challenger model name, no stamp or markings to indicate it is a 1 kilo weight discus. I paid for a brand name but who knows what I got? Very disappointing. Kept it though because it works and keeping it was a lot simpler than the hassle of returning it."
5,A most informative book,"Am find this book very useful indeed. It is easy to read, with simplified explanations of difficult concept in science and spirituality. Would recommend it to those who find these concepts difficult to grasp."
4,Perfect for 4 yr olds!,"This is a good game for 4 year olds, who probably have a hard time keeping on track playing other games. It's simple and they can suceed. Anyone older would probably find it babyish."
5,Great game for little ones,My daughter loves this game. She is only 2.5 yrs old and is really good at it. She has learned a lot while playing as well. Easy to play and fun for the whole family. I highly recommend.
5,Wonderful toddler & preschool game!!,"I found this game at a yard sale and decided to give it a chance. My lil guy is 2.5 yrs and loves Diego and WOW, what a hit! Heavy-Duty & Durable cards and pieces, teaches counting & animals. We don't really play it like a game yet as he's too little, but we like to lay out all the cards and play the matching (""Can you find 8 flying birds?"" then he matches the piece to the card). A great first game, a fantastic christmas present!!!!"
4,Good Game for Non-readers,We have fun with this game. I like it because it's mindless and quick and my four year old son likes the sorting and selecting. I also like that my son can play it with his kindergarten brother pretty independently since the rules are clear and it really isn't very competitive.
2,This is really boring!!,"This game really bored my three year old and definitely me! I didn't think it was very educational, my daughter paid no attention to how many of each animal was on a ""tile""--they're cardboard, so there was no counting. It was just a snoozer that has sat on the shelf after several times of trying to make it interesting. Save your money and get a Cariboo, etc."
3,Boring,Played with a 2 year old and a four year old. Both know their numbers. The animals on the cards were not familiar enough to make this fun. They were not different enough for picture identification or to have children engage in conversation about animals.Just o.k.
5,A wonderfully wholesome collection that promotes creativity.,"The Persuasions' new album "" On the Good Ship Lollipop"" is such a wonderful collection of tunes that I just had to share my thoughts. The beauty of the album is that it not only entertains the children , but promotes an appreciation of the human voice that the typical children's album doesn't even approach. The excitemnt of singing along with "" On top of Spaghetti"" , ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" and "" Shoo Fly , Don't bother Me "" thrills the kids so much more than the dozens of other CD's they have. The fun of singing without music in the background is such an exciting discovery for them. It's so exciting for me to hear them having so much fun with music. I would highly recommend this album to any parent who wants to inspire creativity in their children instead of the usual "" Mind Numbing "" effect of most children""s albums."
5,Hearing The Inner Voice,"While I've read probably dozens of books on learning to trust our inner voice, or intuition, I've got to say that this is one of the best. The author is very down-to-earth, not tempted by the tendency of many writers in this field to actually ""mystify"" a reality that each of us recognizes and occassionally even taps into--with or without training. What Gail Harris helps us do is develop tools for recognizing, for example, the difference between a message from our heads and one from our hearts. I also like the short and sweet exercises throughout, highlighted and boxed, called ""Delving Deeper."" Most of these suggest simple daily practices through which we slowly build our trust in our own inner knowing. This book should be in the collections of anyone who is interested in developing or expanding their intuitive or psychic skills. I really like it!"
5,Trusting yourself- the most important thing,"Gail Harris has given us a book that takes the reader on a journey to learn the many ways to listen to that still, soft voice within each of us. And she has done it in a way that is very accessible to anyone with the desire to listen and trust that her inner voice knows what is right for her, even though it may conflict with what she has learned is ""right"". What is special about this book is that Harris has written it in a voice that is the same as the inner voice she describes - loving, supportive, non-authoritative, non-judgmental - while still asking the reader to stretch to fulfill her divine potential. In a world awash with self-help books whose subtle message is ""you're not good enough - you need to improve,"" here, finally, is a book that convinces us that we are fine exactly as we are."
5,BEAUTIFUL,"this book is great. perfect. easy to understand, and beautiful. every left page has the history of the artist, and the right page has a familiar famous painting of theirs. there is also a timeline. If you are interested in art, get this book."
5,"Excellent book, well illustrated and well done","An excellent summary of each of over 250 artists, each with one representative example of his/her art. Illustrations are high quality and well described, with an informative thumbnail biography of each artist. This is a small-format book, well suited to survey-class student use as a reference. A previous reviewer seems to have had an axe to grind with coverage of female modern artists. This is perhaps a justifiable comment since 25% of the book's pages are dedicated to post-1900 works that are esoteric to the point of incommunicability, and females have probably had as much of a hand in this nefarious endeavor as men... ."
5,"Bought this 2nd copy for my study room, as part of my art library. The 1st one is for everyday use","This book is my go to book for all references! I have had this with me for over 7years or so now.(this 2nd purchase was purely to keep in my library while I use the 1st copy for everyday use..)It has beautiful full page pictures of almost all of the important pieces, the art is presented in a cronological manner by the centuries and even by the ""period"" it belongs in.There is also a little paragraph about the painter itself.Overall a great book to start your art book collection."
1,Writing women out of the arts,"If you want a book that almost completely writes out of the record women artists of the 20th century, then this is the book for you."
3,NOTES FOR THE COLLECTOR OF MALE EROTICA,"Photobook of 60 color photographs of male nudes. Photography isnot too hot, or at least the print of the photography is not verygood, so Caveat Emptor. For the short, flimsy photobook this is, and the often blurry-grainey photographs, [it] is a whole lotta moolah...too much moolah... However, the guys are great; Real People and not Beefy, Brainless, Bimbos. The photobook is also just that...photos, unburdened by silly, new-agey, snobbish nonsense text ala Bianchi. The ""Brett"" series at the end is especially good. What can I say...if you like male erotica of Real Guys and not The Living Dead this is an excellent book for your collection. Just a bit overpriced for the quality of the photography itself."
3,So and so pics of next-door lads,"Slim volume, 2nd rate printing. Small, somewhat fuzzy images of next-door lads."
3,Too terse,"While James Ellroy has many fans, and while agreeing that short articles are undoubtedly his metier, I found that a whole book made up of these sentences was just too much !! His love affair with alliteration is fine for a few phrases, but whole chapters..just too tiring.This was probably the wrong book to read as an introduction to his work, so I'll try another where the style is a little more flowing so that one can concentrate on the story without being irritated by hte jerky sentences."
4,Crime Wave's a Wicked Wonderful Work,"The Demon Dog dishes out his dirtiest, most daring, most dastardly, debauchery to date. Getchell's got giant gonads and guts galore. Contino carries charismatic crime capers to catastrophic climaxes. Ellory's emotional actual-event epitaphs encourage entire exposure. Love these legendary lores that lay down the law and lore you in."
1,Not my cup of tea - though it may be yours!,"When will I ever learn? - James Ellroy is NOT my cup of tea. However if you go for short, smiple, one-two-punch simple declarative sentences and lots of dirty words - perhaps he is yours! This book is in Ellroy's usual tough-guy mode, and frankly I found it a great bore. Why do I keep buying his books, anyway?"
2,Too disjointed to be entertaining...,"I am a huge Ellroy fan. I have read nearly every one of his books, but this one just didn't cut it. The haphazard approach of putting together his essays on popular culture and hollywood with some short fiction based on a few of his characters from the LA Quartet was too much. I couldn't get focused on any of the fiction, and the long winded diatribes on the vaccuousness of celebrityism in LA (talk about an easy target), together with an endless, hyper-syllabic dissertation on why the O.J. trial was a circus (really?) made me long for the end.Don't even check it out of the library..."
4,The other side of the story...,"Brian O'Leary, by his own story, is not astronaut material, but that wasn't obvious until he was going through the training. It's a candid story, and I couldn't help but wonder ""WHAT DID YOU EXPECT???""."
5,Yum!!!,I have been on a low carb diet (on and off) for years and this is the ONLY pasta I have ever tried that is delicious! Most low carb pastas taste like cardboard but this one is delicious and tastes exactly like . . .pasta. If you have tried others and hated them don't be discouraged this one truly is delicious!
5,In Moderation is the key,"I can't believe this is good for you! Talk about wonderful, I made this with my regular homemade sauce, using sugar free tomato sauce etc, and it as absolutely fabulous! I couldn't taste the difference! I don't know if it's because I haven't had any pasta in so long that it was so good.. or it was just that good. I believe you have to eat this in moderation as in anything. Eating the whole box as I read in one review will definately spike your insulin levels... uh yeah..duh! As the box serves 6 people! Portion is the key here and cooking exactly according to directions is key also. Purchase.. you will not regret it!"
2,If it seems too good to be true ...,"Dreamfields pasta is indistinguishable from the real thing. I have made salads for potlucks with it and no one knew any differently. However, due to the convoluted ""digestible carbs"" issue I would be extremely loath to recommend this to either low-carb dieters or diabetics, as there's a lot of evidence that it's not truly low-carb. There are still studies being done on it, so caveat emptor!"
2,Diabetics Beware,"Since the total carbs are what is important for diabetics, this should not be recommended. It has 42 grams of carbs and only 4 grams of fiber per 1/2 cup of cooked pasta. This is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal. Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who can eat just one cup of pasta?It is very misleading to diabetics as ""digestible carbs"" has no meaning to them. Total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic. Thus diabetics beware. If you want to eat it remember, 1/2 cup is a complete meal of carbs."
1,Awful,"The product was awful. I tried one dish & threw the rest out. It didn't taste or feel close to regular spaghetti. I am diabetic so I decided to try low carb spaghetti. The write ups on this product are extremely misleading. I guessDreamfields Healthy Low Carb Living Pasta, Penne Rigate, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) i will have to do without spaghetti@"
1,spaghetti,Not at all as wonderful as described in the literature Mahota's blood sugar shot up after she ate the whole box at one sitting. She says she still thinks they say it has insulin in it. The advertising is not too clear.
2,Tastes Great BUT,"This pasta tastes great, but it made my blood sugar rise as much as any other pasta.Don't know why it affects some people differently."
5,A godsend,"This stuff is awesome. It tastes completely like regular spaghetti. It's kind of expensive here though. Netrition dot com has it for two dollars and fifty cents. For a perfect match, there's a marinara sauce called Vito's Garlic Sauce. It's one of those great tasting things that is coincidentally zero carbs! So I cook up half a box of these spaghettit noodles, pour 1/3 a jar of Vito's on it along with some sliced mushrooms and parmesan cheese and altogether it's maybe 18 carbs. And that's a heaping mountain of spaghetti! Life is good! 8^)"
1,tow lights,Not very good. Cheap as they do not work like other lights I have used. Would not refer to a friend.
5,Her best solo project,"A very soulful singer, with excellent looks to boot! Her remake of the Jean Carn song ""I'm in love once again"" is worth the cost of the cd alone. Buy this project. You won't be disappointed!"
3,There are better Howlin' Wolf sets out there,"Just because it is Howlin' Wolf, a blues icon, I give it three stars. But, it can't be called a 'Gold Collection' when so many hit songs are missing. Where are 'Smokestack Lightning' and 'Sittin' On Top Of The World'? Those are Wolf's biggest hits, and none of them appear here.Bottom line, if you want a good starting place for the Wolf, check out '20th Century Masters,' 'The Definitive Collection,' or 'His Best.' But, unless your a die-hard Wolf fan, I advise you ignore this one."
4,"good, cheap sight","It's a good, simple sight. Does the job. I wish the pins would hold up a little better, but i was able to replace them no problem after 4 years of use. They aren't too bright under extremely low light. I wish their was a little LED on them. Actually looking for a new one."
3,...Don't Remember,"Well, the music here is fine. But largely this collection sounds uninspired. Whereas previous albums of hers had me glued to the lyrics and re-listening every chance I got, I have to remind myself to listen to this one. Not that it is awful. It just doesn't go anywhere. She sounds bored, so I guess I'm bored too. I know what she's capable of, so I miss the clever lyrics and brassy sound of CAPTAIN SWING, the passionate and original voice of SHORT SHARP SHOCKED, or the musicianship of ARKANSAS TRAVELER.I still give this one 3 stars, based on her previous track record and the simple fact that this isn't really a bad album, especially when compared to her peers. Also, she retains a ""one of a kind"" quality that some singer/songwriters never come close to achieving.Don't get me started on the *genius* who designed the packaging."
1,What a disappointment,"Don't Ask Don't Tell (Dig)This CD was a huge disappointment. From her early work in Michelle Shocked which was so wonderful I could not even recognize her in this cd. Apparently she has sold out to try to be a pop star. Her songs have none of the acerbic wit and observations that she displayed in her earlier work. I couldn't even recognize her voice. I had to double check to make sure that it was the same person. I won't be buying any more cd's by her. But get the first one, Michelle Shocked with a picture of her being hauled away by riot cops. That one is good."
4,Terrific collection of songs,"I don't what I like more: the cover or the music. Mind you, the cover is a hoot. I still laugh every time I reda the liner notes. Michelle has a career as a comedy writer if this song thing don't work out.But the song thing is superb. Not as idio-syncratic as you might expect, but still filled with wry observations, terrific melodies and finely crafted instrumentation: as you would expect, everything is perfectly suited to each tune.As angry as you can get with W, God bless MS for bringing a much needed smile. Imagine what havoc would be wreaked if she came home as Mary Cheney's new girlfriend? I'd pay hard money to go to that Thanksgiving Dinner.So, enjoy this CD, it's great craic start to finish, and even if yer tone deaf, you'll find yourself laughing out loud at the humour."
5,Continued Praise,"One of America's best choirs continues to share with the world the precious experience of heartfelt praise for Jesus Christ, our Lord & Saviour. This purchase was a replacement for me; don't really know what happened to the first one. But I did know that I did not want to be with out it in my collection of The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir and Singers recordings."
3,A few unforgettable songs,"""Lead Me Lord"" and ""I'm Not Afraid"" are well worth the price of this CD. I do not think the whole album is particularly strong though. But hey...mediocre Brooklyn Tabernacle is better than the best by anybody else. I recommend it."
3,quite a combination,"The first half is Mexican cantina songs. Not bad songs, just not my favorite genre. I really bought this CD for the blues songs in the second half; they are excellent. Now if we could just get her to do a whole CD of blues or blues-rock."
1,AN INSULTING FATS DOMINO CHEAPIE,"This compilation is a LOSER, an actual insult to the Fat Man and his fans. Most tracks are drowning in audience noise and/or distorted sound, and many tracks are fade-ins/outs - i.e. the first opening notes and sometimes vocals are missing, and many of the well-known endings are quickly faded out - all to get rid of the audience mess. You miss a LOT of Fats' wonderful piano intros and cool closing bars. Well, you get what you pay for - but in this case you get pretty much nothing of what you really would want to hear of The Fat Man's music."
2,not his best,"A disappointing CD, received as a gift. The cover of my CD doesn't match the cover shown here on Amazon, but the twelve songs are the same. This is apparently a live recording, not sure from what era, but it doesn't have the same soul as his original recordings. Can I suggest that if the record company had continued to use the Amazon photo, the person giving it to me wouldn't have bought it, no matter how cheap?"
1,Door was badly damaged/ Amazon return policy was great!,"After researching many different models, I decided to order the Sharp R-520LW. I was hoping that the microwave would be white (i.e., not black as some other Sharp models) and fortunately, it was white. Unfortunately, immediately after opening the box - I noticed that the door would not open. It turns out that there was a large crack at the bottom of the door and it would not even open. I could not tell by looking at the box if it was damaged during delivery but the box did not appear to be sturdy enough for a microwave of this size and weight. As a result, I decided not to try ordering the same product again. I must say that Amazon's return policy was great. I immediately sent the microwave back via UPS and promptly received my refund from Amazon. Despite the bad experience with this microwave, I would definitely order again from Amazon because of its return policy."
5,Great product at any price,"We received this product sooner than expected from Amazon, within 2 or 3 days of order. It heats more evenly and effectively than our previous microwave which was a Panasonic. We are especially pleased with the ""sensor reheat"" function which heats evenly to eating temperature and does not overheat food. At this writing we had only been using the product for one month, but so far we are completely satisfied."
1,Disappointment,"My first microwave was a Sharp Carousel. After 22 years, it still was working well, but the display went wacky. So, I bought another, but larger version. Although the reviews were not stellar, I took a chance. What a disappointment. It's LOUDER,and the door opener is flimsy. Now, after ONE YEAR, the door opener pops the top hinge, but not the bottom. I am now looking for a new microwave. In the meantime, we have to press the door opener, and use our hand underneath the door to dislodge...sometimes, it takes a minute to do so!"
5,Pretty good,"I got a Sharp microwave to replace a 15 or 20 yr old one that pooped out. So far, so good. It has been used primarily for heating leftovers and steaming vegetables so I haven't given it a good workout in the month I've had it.Amazon shipped it in a couple days even with the supersaver shipping (supposed to take 7-10 days).If things go south, I'll be back with more comments.My only concern was that I researched this quite a bit, using Consumer Reports and several other customer comment sites (including Amazon) but the reviews were so all over the place, I was frustrated in trying to find the PERFECT microwave, so I took a chance. Like I said, so far so good."
1,Sharp R-520LW Full Size Countertop Microwave,Quit working after one year of use. Bought from Vanns. Contacted - can't help warranty is 90 days. Money down the drain!
1,bedhead only,the bed is nice and arrived quickly but it is only the headboard NO FRAME OR FOOTBOARD like to picture depicts i mailed it back and got the whole set somewhere else.
1,Best Quality,I have been searching for this exact shirt for my boyfriend for weeks. I have ordered all sorts of this type and this is by far the best quality. Not too thin or heavy. Takes a little while to receive the items but worth the wait.
5,Thermal Undershirts,I had a hard time finding white thermal undershirts until I came upon your company. I am glad you carry them. My son loves these shirts! He wears them to work under his work shirt.
1,What a disgrace,"I had the same problem,it looked like it was washed ,the tag was all ripped and crumbled ,it was a Xmas gift but I couldn't give it to someone like that. Not even worth returning. 16 dollars in the garbage !!! Totally outraged!!"
2,Too babyish for my 6 year old,"Pretty illustrations, but I'm not sure how this book ranked for ages 6+, but my 6 year old was bored with this book by the 2nd page. She announced ""this is babyish"" and then wanted me to read her one of our other books about space instead. This book will go straight into our pile of stuff getting ready to be given away to Goodwill. The Glow in the Dark Constellations Guide for Young Stargazers is much more informative and interesting for my child."
3,Nice pictures,This book has nice pictures. Just minimal information though. I was hoping for more historical information on the story of the stars.
1,"Meaningless title, meaningless book ................","The worst creativity book I've found. And that's saying something. I think this author has been whacked on the side of the head one too many times.His theme as usual is temporarily opening mental locks (this time courtesy of a guy who's been dead 2,500 years). But that will always be a superficial solution. The only way to be truly creative is to permanently remove mental locks. And that is something he doesn't know anything about, or he wouldn't be asking Heraclitus to help him out."
5,A very strong series,"If you watched the Tsubasa Chronicles, must-watch.Very myth/ideas-heavy. If you wanted a shonen anime, looking at the wrong place and author.That said, spectacularly intricate but well-woven plot, combined with Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles. As always, unparalleled character development on the part of the authors. There are animes you watch for the action and animes that you watch for the story. This is certainly the latter."
4,BOOK REVIEW,"Excellent read in the first third of the book, boring and dragging for the rest, and maddening at the end."
2,Not a Tonka,"VERy small. my son love trucks ( doubles ) and he thought it was going to be two big ones with a hooker in between. It did have a hooker.He played with them on Christmas Day and I found them abandoned in my truck. I asked if e wanted them and he said ""no."" I was very surprised. Measurements before hand would of been GREAT!"
2,Needs better labeling on Amazon,"Everything I read on Amazon said this card works on XP and does exactly what I wanted, especially the Clear QAM channels. Unfortunately when I got the card it says right on the box that XP doesn't support Clear QAM channels! Why is that not on the technical specs for this card on Amazon? It could have saved me the frustration and us both the trouble of shipping it back. If your buying this for a Vista PC with Media Center it is probably a good card but don't bother on XP."
5,A great collection from a great performer,"""The Collection"" is a welcome addition to the Whitman line up of cd's available. I particularly enjoyed some of the lesser known versions of Slim's songs. For example, the opening track Rose Marie, this version was recorded but never released and thanks to Paul Hazel, the albums compiler, is now available to Whitman fans. Many other great songs are included and I must say how good it is to be able to purchase on cd Slim's later uptempo version of When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again. There are also other songs included from the late 1970's which appear to be on cd now for the first time. This cd The Collection presents excellent value!!"
3,Just an ok book,"Possible SpoilerI thought this book would be good considering the reviews. I was quite disappointed. The only thing Jeb and Chloe have in common is s game of Checkers and short conversations, in which they argue within five minutes. They pretty much can't stand eachother til the last page. I would have rather seen her with Holt."
5,A Perfect Weekend Read,"This was the perfect story for curling up on the sofa with a cozy blanket, and a sleeping cat or dog at your side. Jeb and Chloe's story was heartwarming.I enjoyed that their story began after things between Jeb and Chloe had already become very developed. I felt as though I was thrust right into the story from the very beginning, and couldn't put it down for very long until the last page. Jeb and Chloe are head strong, yet you can't help but fall in love with them.I'm looking forward to reading the other novels in this series. And I'm hoping that I will get a change to read Holt's story as well. He's such an interesting character, I think his would be a wounderful tale."
3,"Ok, I suppose","As a whole I liked the series. Haven't yet finished this one because it started dragging. Most of the time Mz. Miller's writing style and similes make for a colorful read. I've read several other of her books and I find all her characters sound alike. One could change the characters names and set them in a different town and situation and you have a new book, which can make for tedious reading. In my opinion, Jeb is more immature than the other brothers. He seems to have no plan for his life. I don't think much of Angus. What kind of father pits his three sons against each other for ownership rights of his ranch then expects respect? When I run out of anything to read, I'll may finish the book."
3,pretty good,"I didn't read the other books in this series, but I enjoyed this one, and it wasn't hard to catch up on what had already happened. My only problem is that there wasn't nearly enough of the two main characters together. I liked the Holt and Lizzie side story, but it started to dominate the whole book. Then there were parts about Sue Ellen and the Jessup kids thrown in, and I was thinking, ""what do I care about these people? I want to read about Jeb and Chloe!"" The little they were together, I thought the banter was funny while waiting for them to get past their stubborness and realize they belong together."
3,Was this for real?,"As I kept reading this book it kept drifting to Holt. I was beginning to wonder who this book was about, Jeb or Holt? I kind of hoped Chloe & Holt would get together. Angus and his wife having a baby, I can't figure that one out as old as he was and as young as she was. That was a little unreal. I liked the chemistry between Jeb and Chloe. The children is this book were good secondary characters. Sometimes I think the author forgot she was writing about the late 1800's. There seemed to be a lot of modern day things in this book. Were there really bathrooms with hot and cold running water and toilets that flushed? Rodeos? Bronc riders? Really????"
5,"Hard to find, but not on Amazon!","I needed this book for a present, couldn't find it at 3 bookstores. Then got home on my computer, Amazon did not disappoint me once again! I had it in my hands 2 days later in time for giving! And the price was of course cheaper than the stores!"
5,Secoundhand Bride,"I liked it all the Mckettrick book are great, there could be more romance but great story lines,they have a long line of series."
5,AWESOME,IT IS AN AWESOME CD. I LOVE LISTENING TO JESSE SINGING LIVE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANY AND ALL JESSE MCCARTNEY FANS.
5,jesse mccartney,i love his music and u all are good place to order things from off line it was my first time ordeing on line i will contuie to order
2,it was ok,this was a weird movie def watched it but not sure if it would recommend it..it was kinda weird how she was so nerdy
4,sheldamos,"I cant explain what it is about this movie that appeals to me. its simple and quirky...clever cast...and a few twists to keep it rolling. granted, it will never see the Academy Awards, or any awards for that matter but still a fun movie to sit and watch. Judy Greer is awsome as is Chloe Sevigny, and Patric Wilson floored me when he came to his mothers house to find a suport group waiting for him...that scene alone is worth watching."
3,Not for warm weather shipping,"Love the Pocky strawberry, but they should not be shipped in warm weather. They were all melted and stuck together, with most of the strawberry fudge left on the inside of the wrapper. Also, not too thrilled that they do contain trans fats."
4,Chocolate is better...,"I like the chocolate once better. Strawberry is very sweet, but flavorful. I am not sure I will buy these again or just chocolate."
5,Recommended!,"I never wrote a review for a book before, so im going to keep this short and sweet. The story is a great mix of western and the story of a canadain working the hollywoods film industry. I had to read this at my college and its a great read and will leave you with a new perspective on how history works and how we cannot expect it to remain true to the facts."
2,No redeeming qualities in any of these characters.,"Well written but not my type of story. It gets darker and sadder and you would hope there would be a good feeling somewhere along the storyline. Not in this book. Yes its about the massacre in Saskatchewan, but I look to books for some kind of feel good. Just not my type of read. Sorry."
1,BORING,By far the boringest most pointless book I've ever read in my life. I seriously don't see how it won this award and I seriously don't see a life in anybody who would bother to read past the first chapter of this pointless novel.
1,SUCKS,"By far the dumbest, most confusing novel I have ever read. We read it in our Contemporary fiction class in College and we are now trying to get them to change the curriculm so we are never forced to read such rubbish again."
3,"Cute, not a huge hit with the toddler though","The Long-Nosed Pig and The Wide-Mouthed Frog are my daughter's favorite pop-up books. The Mouse Who Ate Bananas is pretty good, but isn't as entertaining as the other Faulkner pop-ups mentioned above, which are excellent. We still read the Mouse book, but not nearly as much as the other two."
1,Dumb,"Nintendo is getting out of hand. Mario games are getting crappier, crappier and crappier. Mario is for one year olds. He should die. Maybe Sonic, Halo or any other character that doesn't come from nintendo should be world famous than this weakest-character-in-the-video game-history. All of his games is junk. This game is badd."
4,GREAT TO HAVE IT ON CD AT LAST!,"This 1983 release was Howard Johnson's debut album and was definitely hot. ""So Fine"" will always be remembered by many as one of the hottest dance tracks of the early 1980s but the whole album was great from beginning to end. All eight tracks were produced by Kashif and an up-and-coming Paul Laurence. Howard Johnson would subsequently work with other producers but they could not duplicate this album's magic."
3,Howard Johnson...Keepin' Love New...,"I've been waiting 19 years for this album, and now it's finally available (as an import). I've a strong sentimental attachment to this album, particularly the songs ""So Fine"" and ""Take me through the night."" I wore my parent's turntable out with those two songs and would rate them FIVE STARS EACH (if I could). I'm paying import for this album, but, so be it! Three stars for the album overall!"
3,Not made well,"They look great in the picture and look pretty good in person as well. The problem is they don't fit true to size. I would say they run a bit big. Also they don't feel like a substantial shoe, they feel like they weren't made very well. I wouldn't spend too much time walking around in them either, they don't provide much support. The color is great and they go great with jeans. Otherwise, I wouldn't say this was a great buy."
3,good movie,this was a really good movie misty was really good in it though the special fx was really hokey but all in all it was not bad
4,Martial--Rome's Profane Poet,"D.R. Shackleton Bailey brings us a fresh and vibrant prose translation of Martial's clever, humorous and bawdy Epigrams. Bailey's crowning achievement lies in his illuminating footnotes and in his clear-cut translation which reads like poetry when digested; for his prose rendition is still very rythmic, full of vigor and imagery. Now, Martial's poems tell us much of ordinary life in first century Rome and reveal also a bit of the obscene and the ridiculous. And even if his lines do at times wax a little profane, we may exonerate Martial if his testimony is true, when he proclaims ""my page is wanton, but my life is clean."" Overall, the Epigrams carry a satirical charm that is purely characteristic of Rome and extremely enticing to the Latin enthusiast."
1,missed the mark,"I found the book a very ""jerky"" read. It seems to be the product of a mind that is hyperactive and it often only has relavence to the author. It's too ""cute"". The largely biographical book is neither funny, informative and certainly not interesting. Pass on this one if you want some substance."
4,Funny stories of growing up with golf and being Bill Murray,"If you are a fan of Bill Murray's and a golfer you want to like this book a lot. Little disappoints in this volumn and it is a lot of fun to read. I laughed out loud at least once in every chapter. The remarkable thing about this book is just how much a part of Bill Murray's life golf really is -- and just how much a part of golf Bill Murray has become. This is by no means a literary masterpiece, in fact, in several spots the reader is sure to wonder if any one proof-read this for continuity. However, this book does a great job in bringing the reader into the ""never a dull moment"" golf-life of Bill Murray. I'm left to wonder what would a Bill Murray celebrity pro-am be like -- probably a ""caddy challenge match"" and more fun people have had in years. A good read, that leaves you happier, if not better, for having read it."
4,"A ""Gonzo"" Book on Golf","This book reads the way most people play golf, all over the fairway, which is not to say it lacks direction or purpose. It reads like works by a certain 'Gonzo Journalist' who if you don't know or understand you will not like this book. It is in the grand tradition of Kerouac, Cassidy, and Thompson. It is not Golfing in the Kingdom but it is entertaining and revealing."
3,"Comme ci, comme ca","I had to read some sections twice to figure out what Murray was talking about. It reads like one of his side-of-the-mouth monologues. You have to be hooked into Murray's wavelength to appreciate it. It would be much funnier to see him read this, to see his dancing eyes, his sly expressions, etc. These words often just lie there on the page. If you don't use your imagination, you won't find this funny. A good editor would have cleaned up a lot of the confusion, but Peper fell down on the job. It's worth a read if you can expend the effort. If you want something easy and accessible, this isn't for you."
2,"My one-word review would be ""Huh?""","I love Bill Murray. I'm sure he has funny stories to tell, but they did not translate to the written word in this book. Maybe the audio version of the book works better. Or maybe it works better if you're a golfer. I'm not. My thought throughout this book was, ""Huh? I don't get it.""Murray is not a writer, but George Peper supposedly is. As I see it, it was Murray's job to tell the stories and Peper's job to craft them into a book. Peper didn't do his job.This is disjointed, unprofessional, impossible to follow, and not worth the trouble. But I still love Bill Murray."
1,Disappointing,"I found the book terribly disjointed and aimless. At times, the book was difficult to read and follow what Murray was talking about, and whether a particular anecdote ever had a conclusion, let alone any resolution. Most of the text goes nowhere, and has little to do with golf. Worse yet, the humor sorely lacks. I received the book as a gift and am glad I didn't pay money for it."
1,I was expecting better,"Bill Murray is one of the funniest people in television and motion pictures today. Unfortunately he seems to have wandered into entertainment territories unknown- books. Although it has its moments, this book is nothing more than a collection of inside jokes and innuendoes about Mr. Murray's life on and off the golf course. Difficult to follow and understand, the first half of the book is so disjointed and scattered it made me not want to even put in the effort to read the second half. Bill, I love ya, but please stick to what you're best at, don't quit your day job!"
1,Waste of money.,This is a haphazard collection of miscellaneous thoughts that is not worth the time or the money. Mr. Murray was out to collect a paycheck on this one.
2,A Light snack,"Some Funny moments and some good stories, but way too short. The type setting and tons of pictures left you with the impression of a college sophmore trying to pass off an essay by volume. I had the feeling Bill wrote this in his spare time to fulfill a contract. It's got that disconnected feel of ""I've got a couple of minutes, I'll work on the book""I love Murray, but this was a real dissapointment"
1,Dont waste your money,"I am a big fan of Bill Murray,but this book was a big disapointment.I think he wrote it in the same time it took me to read it.He also jumps around way too much.This book should have been much better."
2,Good but too short,"At times this book is typical Bill Murray, wisecracking and cynical. Most of the stories he tells are amusing. However the book is much too short. You'll be finished reading it before you know it. It seems this book could have been a lot better with just a little more effort by Mr. Murray."
1,Embarrassingly bad,"If you're expecting Caddyshack-type humor, forget it! There isn't a single good joke in all of ""Cinderella Story."" Bill Murray should be embarrassed!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK; IT IS BORING AND BLOATED,"I love Bill Murray. I think he is a tremendous comedian. I loved him in Caddyshack. But I hated this book. It is nothing more than his stream-of-consciousness prattling about golf and whatever else entered his head. I would bet that it took him no more than 72 hours to write this puffery. There are few words on a given page, and there are dozens of generally uninteresting photographs. If this had been typeset like a regular book, it would have been 50 pages long at best. It is, to be honest, a rip-off."
2,This book is a triple bogey....,"As a long-time fan of Bill Murray, I was completely disappointed by this book...the anecdotes never rise above the mundane. I can honestly say I didn't laugh once while reading the book, nor did I once note in an appreciative manner a particularly deft turn of phrase. The Bill that comes across is a know-it-all kind of stuck in his ways, the guy who's undeniably brilliant but probably not that much fun to be around."
2,"Bill, don't give up ...","First, I have to say, I'm a huge Bill Murray fan. We named our daughter Isabelle after the scene in Razor's Edge where he's wandering through the Paris mansion, desperately calling her name. Huge. After reading this book, I really want to see him play golf in one of these celebrity tournaments. I think it would be a hoot. But the book wasn't. It fell short for me, although the little tidbits of the Bill we know and love, which were sprinkled throughout, kept me reading to the end. The photos and captions are worth keeping it on the shelf. Try again, Bill."
1,"Riding on legend, not on substance","Its not good, not worth the time. There are a lot of other good golf books out there. If you havn't read the book, don't review it, OK."
3,"I love Bill Murray, but I'm not sure what this book is.","Where do I begin? The book is certainly not as funny as Bill himself. Also, I knew the book was going to be about golf, but it's really about things related to golf that have nothing to do with Bill, golf, or humor. I'm not sure what I was doing when I bought it. On the plus side, the cover is funny with Bill's hat. There have to be easier ways to become Bill Murray then reading this book."
1,Like looking for gold dust in a pile of ****,"Not much here. If you were thinking of writing a book but felt you may not be good enough read this one. You will soon be infused with confidense that anyone could write something this good. Like other people have said, not worth the trouble. Go hit a bucket of balls at a driving range, that would be more fun."
5,Haven't read book; must be good. Caddyshack was.,"How can it not be good? I mean, this is Bill Murray were talking about.How can it not be good? This is the man who invented golf [in the comedic movie form]. For crying out loud, how can it not be good?"
5,Easy to follow,"Well made, good sound, good instruction.The video quality is excellent but you have to be patient and wait for the instruction for the form as early in the video there are beautiful seines but the instruction of the forms is later."
3,Fuzzy picture,It's okay. The picture is fuzzy and the color is real off. Looks like they ran out of ink with this one. Wouldn't do it again
3,"Informative and engaging, but a bit discontinuous.","A facinating, if confusing account of a medieval legal nightmare involving a senile man, a greedy neighbor, an honest plumber, and a host of interfering townspeople all up in arms over a found pot of gold. The story follows the events of an actual court case that occurred in the French town of Rodez in the mid-1300's, and is full of great historical facts about everyday life in the Middle Ages, including information on customs, beliefs, dress, furniture, foods, entertainment, and philosophies of the townspeople. The actual story, while interesting, could have been made a little clearer and easier to follow, as there are many characters, and it is difficult to keep track of them all. Overall, though, it is definately worth a read!"
5,For the ultimate sharp edge,"I bought this to sharpen my straight razors. It works as advertised. Comes in a nice case that doubles as a holder, the stone itself is BIG- over eight inches long and nearly 3 inches across so honing a razor is a pleasure, and with a delightfully soapy feel to the surface. I have an antique razor that was in poor condition: using #1000, #6000 and then this #12000 grit stone for the final edge brought it back to factory sharpness in less than half an hour. That mirror edge is really something and it passed the shave test with flying colors. Because the stone is actually a ceramic compound, you can also use it to sharpen ceramic kitchen knives like the Victorinox series for example. Expensive but worth every cent.And did I just buy the last one? Sorry about that :)"
5,Greatest Novel Ever Written,"When I was in college (1962) our professor of English off-handedly mentioned The Cloister & The Hearth as the ""greatest novel ever written.""I found a copy, read it, and must agree with his assessment."
4,"Slow to start, needed better editing BUT....","the story line is very good, and some of the situations brought back a lot of the pain associated with how it feels to be gay in straight world.Well done."
2,Gina is better at fanfic,"Gina became known for her Voyager fanfic. She wrote awesome fanfic based on the characters Katherine Janeway and Seven of Nine.She should stick to that arena.This book is slow moving...and well...as much as I hate to say it, it's lame.The love scenes suck...what few there are.Go check out her site Novel Expectations to get a glimpse of the true genius that is Gina Dartt. This book doesn't even begin to touch on the brillance of this writer.I was so disappointed that I almost cried."
3,It's a good book .,Its about a 40 yr. young bookstore owner (Kate Shannon) and a 26 yr. old Keebler supply worker (Nikki Harris). Nikki always come to the bookstore 'Novel Companions' who is owned by Kate and the two became friends. Nikki an out lesbian became attracted to the bookstore owner (Kate)and started to visit the bookstore only once a week . But all that changed when a mysterious fire started not too far from the bookstore and Nikki thinking that the bookstore is on harms' way ( mostly she's concerned about Kate)went to the store and from there the two started their adventure on finding out who started it and who killed the man that was in the burned structure . With all that they still managed to fall for each other despite the bigots in their neighborhood.
5,Excellent Quality Firewire card,"I was having issues with my computer based recording system. Harsh tone, frequent need to reboot, and other computer problems. After I installed this card from SIIG, all the problems were gone. It costs a few dollars more than some, but it is well worth it. The TI chipset it uses is superior to others for recording. Highly recommended for studios."
5,timeless,"i read this book when i was in sixth grade, i am now 33 years old and i still remember what a great story it was to me, so much so that i bought it this christmas for my son who is now in sixth grade.Any story that does that must be brilliant, and it is"
4,Potato Head Kids Volume 2: Poltergeist Potatoes VHS Video,"Description from the back of the cover:In their second volume of delightfully daffy cartoon adventures, the Potato Head Kids are looking for fun ... and they find it! First the kids set out to discover Captain Potatobeard's treasure in POTATO HEAD PIRATES. Then, Puff is captured by Grease and his gang. Not to fear ... ROBIN POTATO HOOD rescues her!

Finally, a TRASHCAN DERBY race provides the exciting backdrop for Smarty Pants' race car to win the big event. So join the Potato Head Kids for laughs, looniness, and loveable shenanigans. You'll find these spuds always have a tater-rific time! Video runs approximately 40 minutes."
5,Amazing voice!,"I bought it just for a few songs I was unable to find elsewhere, but was pleasantly surprised by the rest of the CD. Even now, Bassey's voice remains a powerful and vibrant instrument."
1,Resource Hog,"I have a good system running Vista with a 3g processor and 1g ram. When I installed Bitdefender(the Vista compatible version) my system slowed to a crawl. Windows mail (Vista version of Outlook Express) would open but not run. Web pages would take over 5 minutes to load, if at all. Total resource hog."
1,No Information to share on this product,"I purchased this product along with BitDefender Anti-Virus v10. However, I have not used this product as I have another very powerful internet security program which I am very happy with. Prior to purchasing this product, I read the consumer reviews by others and I ended up purchasing this particular product as there were so many satisfied customers using BitDefenders software. I gave it 1 star ONLY because I have not been able to use it as it is not compatible with my other internet security software. So you be the judge!"
4,"Well done, interesting theories on origins","Although the theories on origins of the Hebrew people as ancient mercenaries is somewhat uncertain, it is a fascinating possibility. The maps are perfect, the text is clear and the analysis is superb. It is a wonderful military history work for anyone interested in ancient warfare. Very well done."
1,I will never buy a book online again!,"This book was of no use whatsoever and had no instructions on how to repair trojans, worms or spyware. Complete, utter waste of time and money!!Lost another one, amazon!Trojans, Worms, and Spyware: A Computer Security Professional's Guide to Malicious Code"
1,"Sorry, but this thing sucks.","My main reason for purchasing this item was to make homemade hummus. Pretty much every recipe says that the best tool for making ""real"" hummus is a food mill.I saw this model and bought it since I knew that I probably would not be a daily food mill user, and the price is right. Well, it did not work for processing soaked and well-cooked chickpeas. In fact, it didn't really work for anything that I tried to make with it. Perhaps I got a bad egg with a weak spring or something, but even the softest of foods would not make it through the holes in the screen.Even though they are a bit more expensive, I would suggest buying a stainless steel product and stay away from ye plastique models. It is my belief that the plastic is not strong enough to provide appropriate support for the blade."
2,Nonnie,I have an old Foley Food Mill that I picked up at a yard sale years ago. It's a bit small but I do like the balance and stability of the matal that I believe is better than the plastic 'Sunbeam 2-quart Food Mill.
2,Not as useful as I hoped,"Mill would not process boiled potatoes. I can make German Noodlebits , but that is all. Recommend others try a different design. Not up to Sunbeam Quality. I wish I had purchased the traditional cone style."
1,not worth the price,Not worth the price doesnt work well ar all sorry spend more money for an all metal one. expensive for a plastic food mill and works lousy
5,food mill,Excellent. The only problem I have is that I do not know which side of the blade is the correct one.Tha goes inside the food mill.
4,Insightful reading,"I love this book, both now as a reference text and when I was reading it - and analysing me and everyone around me. With very interesting examples to prove / disprove theories, Mr. James writes as a clever, witty and genuinely knowledgeable author. This book inspired me to think, analyse, cry, laugh and feel amazed. Everyone should read this - as a child, not as a parent. Be warned!"
5,"Superb, wildly imaginative, yet real...couldn't put it down","I loved this book. McNally thrusts the characters forward and allows the reader to be shocked, feel empathy, root for Ralph and Hank and delve back into his/her confusing and exquisitely naughty pre-teen and teen years. I also liked the format of the book. With Hank as narrator, we get the perspective of one of the most unique voices I can remember in modern fiction. Hank is a complicated character/narrator, and it is a treat to try to figure out his perspectives and the lenses through which he details the events in the different parts of this book. I look forward to reading McNally's latest even though he has stated in a public forum that I am a ""coward"". I will continue to buy and read his books, yet I doubt I will turn up at a book signing for fear of his detecting my cowardice and blowing my cover."
4,Great for summer reading,My son needed to read this book for school. It was an easy read for him. It had diffrent stories . It didn't take him long to finish
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this book because I grew up in Burbank IL and I read that there were many references to the local geography in the book. If you grew up in Burbank in the 70's or 80's, maybe the reminisent references will be enjoyable for you. If not, I think you will be disappointed. Rather than tell a continuous story, McNally has chosen to provide a series of short stories in the first part of the book that are loosely connected. The last 80 pages are a more continuous narrative. It gives the book a schizophrenic feel. While the early chapters provide one or two moments of interesting insights into life, overall I found it to be a tedious read, with unrealistic characters that I never cared about. Especially if you like stories with a beginning, a middle and a satisfying end, don't buy this book."
2,what the....?,"i haven't read a book this bad in quite a while. the characters are completely one-dimensional, and the situations seem contrived. the first two thirds of the book is comprised of anecdotes from junior high school, then the last third is just ridiculous in so many ways... it turns into a murder mystery!? what!?it reads like a bunch of short stories that the author wrote with the intention of publishing separately, which is kind of annoying at times, because he will over-explain something that already happened earlier in the book.i gave this book two stars instead of one because, while it was really bad, it did make me giggle... and i suppose i did enjoy reading it, if only to scoff at it."
5,Good brake pad kit,"I bought these pads (plus rotors) for my 2005 Town & Country to replace the front brakes. The pads came packaged with the rubber seals for the caliper pins, end caps for the seals, and a small amount of brake grease. Don't expect any kind of instructions, though. The pads had a respectable amount of material on them and appear well built. The package claims that they're ""pre-scorched"" so that they don't need to be broken in (repeatedly used at varying speeds to heat up the pads and cause materials used to form the pads to burn off). I believe this is true. I admit that the first few stops I made I was gentle on the brakes, however I have not had any problems with them. They brake quite solidly and reliably. They are also not noisy at all. I would buy them again."
4,"An entertaining speedy racing game, but familiar.","Graphics: 8/10 - Ridge Racer Type 4 is plausible in this area. The car designs are fantastic and the roads are clear and well-crafted.Sound: 9/10 - Fantastic! Not too much of this comes from the cars themselves, but the groovy soundtrack, great commentator and crashing sounds give this baby a boost!Value: 7/10 - A fun car racing game that lasts a long time and challenges you to do better. But in this genre, we have seen games done better and you might want to go off and play them instead.Overall: 8/10 - What can I say? I thought this was a blast. It was fun, energetic and speedy. A good instalment to the Ridge Racer series. The cars were brilliant and the Great Gran Prix is the best part. However, Ridge Racer Type 4 loses points because it is simply too much like Gran Turismo and you might tire of its same-old routine. Still lots of fun and recommended!"
4,Best Arcade Racing Game On The Playstation,"I purchased this game n summer 2000 and everyone n my family was awestruck by the game's intro video music,n-game music and graphics!The only flaw this game has lies n it's 2-player mode which has horrible draw back(can't barely make out the vehicles both players r using)!"
5,Great Racing Action for the PSX,"Impressive. That's a good adjective for this game, I believe. Ridge Racer Type 4 exhibits some really awesome graphics and wonderfully designed tracks. Unlike many racers I've played, Ridge Racer also has a really unique gameplay style to it. In order to succeed, you really must master the art of intentionally ""fishtailing"" your vehicle to get around the sharp curves. There is a lot of technique and finesse to be had here.Did I mention the fantastic graphics? Not even the venerable Gran Turismo compares in the graphics department. The tracks are also designed to minimize the draw in effects off in the distance. As I played through this game, one thought prevailed in my mind. These programmers and game designers knew what they were doing, and they showcased their talents in this amazing game. If you must own one racing game for the PSX, make it Ridge Racer Type 4!"
2,BOOO!,"Yes,this game does have great graphics and a very high framerate but you'll only enjoy it for about a week then you'll throw the game away. Here is why.First .....................They claim to have over 300 but they only have about 50. Each one just has 5 different paint jobs.Secondly trying to get all the cars would be monotonous and boring. You wold have to do the Grand Prix over and over until the end of time.My Final reason is that the way the cars turn is completley unrealistic. Gran Turismo has way better car physics"
1,Lousy,"This game is terrible. I read a review in a gaming magazine which stated the game was comparible to Gran Turismo. What a joke. This game stinks. The gameplay is terrible, it in no way resembles real driving. I purchased and returned this game within the same day."
1,Please don't waste your time playing this game!,And PLEASE don't waste your money buying this game. This game is SO unrealistic...it is nothing close to the driving experience of Gran Turismo. Trust me.
1,DUMB!,"I rented this game and boy am i glad i did not buy this game, because this is one of the worst racing games i have ever played and i reccomend to not buy this game unless you really want to."
4,Great graphics,"other than that, you'll play this game for a couple weeks with great interest, but it'll then get thrown on the shelf. You can only play through the Grand Prix so many times.Good game overall though."
3,"Fun for a day, buy Gran Turismo instead","I'll start off by saying that the graphics, sound, and control in this game are top notch. The action is fast, the scenery is much more pretty than Gran Turismo, and it's very fun while it lasts. The problem is, it doesnt last very long. I went through it in a day and never wanted to play it again, whereas I played GT for a year before getting tired of it. Do yourself a favor, rent this one. There is a much better racer on PSX."
2,"Good graphics, but unrealistic driving.","Anyone who is use the the driving characteristics of Gran Turismo will surely be disappointed with this game. The control over the car seems more controlled by the ""team"" or choice of car than anything to do with your input while driving. While the graphics are great I do not think it makes up for the lack of car control and realistic driving that many have come to expect from a racing simulator after having played Gran Turismo."
1,waste of time,"Don't waste your time reading this book. The author seemed more intent on dazzling the reader with his vocabulary than with character development. The plot was excellent, but it was lost in the verbiage."
4,Chaos,"You won't want to visit the ""stans"", Few survive, those who do are changed beyond their belief. A thriller that is much more. Damnation and redemption, hate and love. A skilled writer shows you people and places, that, if you are lucky, you will never get to see."
1,Inadequate,"Raynes follows the popular fashion of the day, with a style of instruction similar to that of ""Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain"". There is a glaring absence and omission between beginning scrawls and the completed subject. Final drawings are shown, inferring that somehow drawing ability is developed by some mystical process of mental transfer between author and reader. When one considers that there are several dozen books just like Raynes' in their ambiguity, lack of distinction, and omission of intermediate processes, it is gratifying to know that there are still good figure drawing texts on the market; but this just is NOT one of them.Far better for the serious student of FIGURE DRAWING to purchase (1)Jack Hamm, Willy Pogany, Famous Artists School, Walt Reed, ""Art of Drawing the Human Body"" as well as Stephen Rogers Peck and Robert Beverly Hale."
3,"adequate, but better books are readily availble","This book is an adequate overview of methods and techniques in figure drawing. There are other, much better books though you can find just by looking at the customer ratings."
5,Mirror Ball shines bright,Neil Young / Mirror Ball: Some make a big deal of the fact that Pearl Jam is Neil's backing band on this CD but Pearl Jam were merely playing as the band they always wanted to be...Crazy Horse. So some Neil fans complain about the presence of a grunge band and some Pearl Jam fans complain that it's not a Pearl Jam album. Idiots both! This is a Great Neil Young album and Pearl Jam did themselves proud in helping to create it. This one gets Five Stars.
3,Luke Warm at Best,"On paper this looks like a great match up, the ""Grandfather of Grunge"" teaming with his disciples, Pearl Jam. The bad news is that it does not create the masterful one off project that it could of been.It is hard to put a finger on why this album comes up short, but the most glaring is that the songs are not very consistant. DOWNTOWN, I'M THE OCEAN and FALLEN ANGEL are good songs, but the rest are pretty non-descript. To make matters worse, Pearl Jam tend to play at one pace throughout the album and tend to bulldoze any subtlety out of the material. Cray Horse is not as talented musically as PJ, but they know how to support the boss and bring out his best assets.This is not a bad work, but I fail to see how it can get 5 stars from anyone. I don't really play this too often, but when I do I can seldom make it through the duration. This appears to have more in common with Neil's inconsistant 80's work than his more inspired 90's output."
3,Rocking In The Grunge World...,"This is a good Neil Young album but there doesn't seem to be anything new or exciting other than the backing band. I don't like the mixing on the CD because you can hardly here Neil Young singing. Not that he has the greatest voice, but you've got to be able to hear the vocals. Notable tracks are ""Downtown"", ""I'm The Ocean"" and ""Peace and Love"" (co-written by a certain Mr. Vedder)"
2,This album is bad NOISE!,"I have been a Neil Young fan for years. I love the Neil of old but this was [bad]! Teaming up with the band Toe Jam was a mistake. Almost every song here has been done before and better by Young himself. The songs are not a pleasure to listen to, in fact, they are annoying to no end. Where is the originality?"
2,"Sorry, Neil","This is not Neil's best album, in fact probably the most mediocre (IMO). He should have picked a different band to do a collaboration with than the overrated Pearl Jam. PJ fans will probably like this. Fans of Neil w/ Crazy Horse might like it. Those who like Harvest, Goldrush, etc. the best may not."
1,Big Disappointment,"Being A big Pearl Jam fan I was really looking forward to this album, unfortunately this is just another Neal Young album with Pearl Jam as A backing band. Wanted to like the album, listened to it dozens of times but there is just not much there. Instead of this buy the Pearl Jam / Neal Young EP Merkinball which only contains two songs ""i got id"" and ""long Road"", much better than Mirror Ball."
2,Not a great collaberation and not a great album,"Perhaps the most hotly anticipated rock pairing of the 1990s, ""Mirror Ball"" wallows in the mediocrity of most supergroups (including, I might add; Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young). As a huge Young fan, it pains me to say that this is the weakest of his 1990s recordings, the decade which overall featured his revival as a major artist. One wishes that Pearl Jam had served as more than just a backing band for the record. Maybe they could have contributed some better songs as Neil was not up to his usual fine standards as a songwriter."
1,Yuk spit pooey Blach!,I have been listening to Neil for over 20 years now and I have seen him a couple times and stuck by him thru trans and shocking pinks...I love all his work ...neil could fart and it would be brilliant....EXCEPT this album SUCKS. Leave it to an overated pretentious band like Pearl jam to screw up a a neil young album. Neil please dont hang with them anymore
1,Worst Than Reactor...,"Which is saying a lot. Thrown together quickly without the inspiration that made Ragged Glory a classic. Act of Love is horrible, the end of the album is a complete disaster. I've owned this CD two times, and given it away both, the only NY production I've ever abandoned (including Reactor and Journey Through the Past). Let's run this out of circulation and re-issue Time Fades Away!"
1,Don't waste your money.,This is more of a motivational book. It's of limited use if you want `nuts and bolts` information.
3,Watch out for major song repeats form other albums,"I love the Smiths but when I decided to expand my collection I discovered a horrable number of song repeats from album to album (not that I dont mind hearing them again I just did want to pay for it again). On 'Louder than the Bombs' for instance, 'the singles' album duplicates more than 8 songs on a 18 song disk. So if you have other Smiths albums check them throughly. I bought mine retail so I suggest if you get the disc, get it used."
5,One Of The Greatest Singles Bands?,"After listening to this collection of singles from The Smiths' career, I wouldn't argue with somebody stating that they're one of the greatest singles bands of all-time. All of the songs here never grow old or stale. Morrisey established himself as a distinctive, emotional, and unique vocalist with the Smiths' as both he and Marr proved to be brilliant songwriters. Just about every Smiths classic is here: ""Hand In Glove,"" ""How Soon Is Now?,"" ""Bigmouth Strikes Again,"" ""What Difference Does It Make?,"" etc., etc., etc. This is pop-rock at its best and most brilliant. Essential."
4,Very good Smiths starter kit,"This was my first Smiths cd and served as a great introduction to this group (I subsequently have bought 3 other Smiths albums and several Morrissey ones). While it by no means is comprehensive, the album does contain many of the group's finest recorded moments. How Soon Is Now is a particularly outstanding song, although that does not excuse them for including it on no less than 5 albums. It is nice that this album isn't a ""greatest hits"" so that all singles are included, whether they hit the charts or bombed (in the UK that is, as the group never had a US hit yet received underground cult status).The cover art is quite Smithian, but the liner notes leave much to be desired (no track info, no lyrics). I would have liked them to do what The Cure did with their singles packages and show the original single picture sleeves, since Smiths artwork was always part of what gave the group a certain mystique."
4,A good overview,"This compilation covers most (though certainly not all) of the high points of The Smiths' all-too-short career. As has been pointed out, they were an excellent singles band, as this collection clearly illustrates. This would make a great introduction to the group for someone not familiar with the classic work of Morrissey and Marr. A few listens and you'll want to purchase their entire catalog, as well you should.For hardcore fans this album is of little interest, as you undoubtedly own these songs already. For those who are just discovering the Smiths, however, Singles is an excellent place to start."
1,revision,"no llego el cd que pedi, desconozco la razonespero que me puedan dar informes de por que no llega o que me devuelvan mi dinero, gracias"
5,Must have,Great sample of these stuff. A must have for your collection. Great addition to my 80's music collection. Highly recommend.
4,A collectiong of singles...,"when you buy a singles collection, you pretty much know what you're getting ahead of time. I no longer have my record player hooked up, and I'm in the process of transfering a lot of my collection, via the computer, over to CD. So, in the meantime, I picked this up for under a dollar.If you're getting into the Smiths, then this is a good place as any to start... but I'd argue that you might be more interested in the first couple albums.I only give this CD four stars because, while it does have all the singles, the CD booklet has little information. I think there could've been/ should've been a lot more here, especially when you consider that a lot of people who are picking this up are new to the Smiths."
4,Solid workout!,Good workout with basic yoga moves. He keeps you moving through the exercises without stopping which provides a challenging workout.
3,It's OK.,"I borrowed this from the library.It's NOT for beginners, it is only for people who have already been coached in proper form by a yoga teacher.But, if you practice yoga a lot, you won't find this workout very interesting.It's ok. Something I would play if I didn't have anything else, but not something I would buy."
4,Yoga for the Jock,"In the first five minutes, it is obvious that this is not your average yoga workout DVD. Gone are the bonsai trees and eco friendly yoga mats and, instead, we find a weight lifting gym equipped with steel lockers and heavy metal music.Review continued at [...]"
1,Rock Music & Yoga? Seriously?,"Really, rock music? It's a way to ruin a potential good yoga workout. Sorry folks, can't recommend it."
3,Great Workout!,"This dvd is a great workout if you like power yoga!The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't include a wider variety of yoga poses and Bob Harper isn't the greatest guide. The first time I did this video, I often found myself stopping to watch what they were doing because he doesn't guide you through every single move."
5,Best Vinyasa/Ashtanga yoga DVD!,"I have been practicing yoga for over 7 years, and prefer a challenging vinyasa flow style class in the studio.At home, I have tried many yoga dvd's, hoping to find one that best imitates a true vinyasa class.This is by far my favorite yoga dvd that I have found. Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown is a close second.I also own Bob's Biggest Loser Yoga dvd, which is a great workout, however it is not in the traditional vinyasa style.I would highly recommend this dvd to any yoga enthusiast, however it would not be suitable for a beginner."
5,Workout,I love yoga but I also have love for many other exercises. I love this dvd because you still get the stretching and strengthening of yoga with an added challenge. Maybe its my competitive nature but I'll always take a challenge. Thanks Bob!
1,disappointed,As the video starts Bob says get ready for a yoga workout like you've never done before. Well I did the whole dvd and found this was a very basic yoga dvd nothing innovative or different like he promised. Nothing special I would not waste my money on this. There are many more quality intermediate level yoga dvds that are way better such as radiant flow which is an excellent dvd or Sadie Nardini much more quality yoga without the hype.
5,"Nice, intense workout","Bob is a really great trainer and good at motivating to keep your strength up during the workout. The music is really nice, it ranges from mellow to a little more intense, matching the movements that you are doing. The workout is pretty basic for those who have practiced yoga with a couple of awesome, advanced poses."
4,Intense Yoga- NOT for beginners,I love yoga. It's a relaxing way to stretch and get some exercise in. But Bob Harper's is HARD and I've been doing yoga for 5 years. It gets the muscles going and you break a sweat for sure. This is not a beginner's yoga DVD.
4,Tough Yoga Workout,This is a good yoga workout. I also really like the 15 minutes of abs he has on this DVD. Both are challenging workouts.
5,I'm Glad I Didn't Let The Negative Reviews Scare Me Away,Although this isn't the most challenging yoga DVD I've ever done it's still a solid hour of yoga that covers the bases and flows rather well. I agree with the other reviewers that Bob's Weight Loss Yoga DVD is harder but this one is nice to do on those days when I don't feel like I can handle a Mark Blanchard DVD (that guy doesn't mess around) but still want a good yoga workout. I really like Bob's teaching style and find him very motivating. If you want to lose weight I'd recommend Bob's other DVD but if you want to add a moderately challenging and enjoyable yoga workout to your rotation I think this one would fit the bill.
5,Must Try!!!,I was skeptical at first because I had never down Yoga before. All I can say is WOW. Bob Harper is the BEST trainer EVER!!! He walks you thru each and every move. Boy was I burning thru out that work out but felt GREAT at the end. I've been doing this work out 5 days and week for a little under a month and have already noticed a huge difference!! Love this DVD and Bob Harper!!! Cant wait to try his other DVDs!! Buy this and you wont be dissapointed!!
5,When you love Arizona...,"I purchased this CD for the single ""Arizona"", but have enjoyed the rest of the songs as well. I typically listen to classic rock, and was not a big fan of country-western music. This CD is neither, though it is ""classic"". Last weekend, I drove up to Arizona's Big Lake, and played this while I parked at an overlook viewing the sunset...nothing better! The emotion it draws out is reminiscent of Pachebel's ""Canon""."
1,Aweful Product,"A friend of mine had these mitts bought for him for Christmas and He and I decided to use them in a training session only using handwraps for knuckle padding. After five minutes my middle knuckle had torn holes in the ""Everhide"" and actually ripped the foam padding a bit. there are only three awkward leather loops for your fingers, so obviously the designer of this product can't count. Also, the elastic strap the goes around your wrist doesn't keep the mitt from sliding around or from flying off completely."
5,Very Useful,"Great for training with a partner and very fun to use for light drilling the basic punches and kicks of most martial art styles, not just boxing."
4,Good workout!,"Hard as it is to get my son active, I put some speedbag gloves on him and I slapped on these mitts and let him go to town. About 45 minutes of taking turns wailing at each other wearing the mitts and we were both drenched in sweat. What a workout! Strength, cardio, and endurance.These are very well made mitts with good grippability to keep them in place. Good solid padding. Pretty good size too. Overall a good deal."
5,Who do you think you are,"This series originated in the UK on the BBC. They have done 7 excellent series so far and all are fasincting. It was good to see the US version, which is done by the same company, and compare it. In the Bristish version there was a lot of crying and stiff upper lips. In the American a lot of wows! Still it has followed the same format. Try out some of the British shows even if you don't know the people there are some great stories and good historical facts that I knew nothing about."
5,good show,So sorry to hear it has been cancelled on television. I enjoyed all the episodes and got this for a friend who like genealogy.
5,WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,"I LIKE ANCESTOR SHOWS AND THIS IS NOT EXCEPTION, ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN INTERESTING, ITS JUST I WISHEDIT WAS AS EASY TO FIND MY ANCESTORS AS IT WAS FOR THESE CELEBERTIES. I TRY BUT JUST DO NOT GET THE WORDSRIGHT, AND WHEN YOU WRITE ANCESTOR A LETTER THEY DO NOT RESPONE. BUT I STILL LIKE TO WATCH THE SHOW"
4,I'm a believer now,"I had almost given up on ever using a slow cooker again. Every recipe I tried was just not good. Then I got this book, and I haven't cooked a bad recipe from it yet. It's nice to be able to put the ingredients in the pot before work and come home to the smell of dinner ready to eat. We especially loved the Corned Beef and Cabbage, which was perfect!"
2,Extremely poor.,"I found this book extremely disappointing. Not only was it short on facts and technical information, but every question I wanted an answer to was dodged by saying ""best left to experts"".I expected something more along the lines of ""Tuning BL's A-series engine"" by D. Vizard. I could have gotten what little information exists in the book with a few phone calls to local engine tuners."
3,Thin in important areas,I bought this book as there were some important questions I needed answering. Namely Head modifications... which to my dismay were sadly missing. The message to the reader was that such modifications should be left to the experts. Pray tell me what was the point of the book?
4,This game rocks!,When I first heard of what this game was gonna be about I thought it would be stupid. But amazingly it was fun! Actually I don't have the game but i played some of the mini games based on it ...and I thought that the game would be even better!(And it is!)
2,Waste of money.,"I thought the idea of not giving the directions was kinda cool, but I was wrong. This game makes no sense, and is a waste of time. It's fun for a while, but still DO NOT BUY!"
3,Great if you have A.D.D.,This game is really lots of mini games rolled into one. It's a solid original concept. Some of the games make you laugh so hard you nearly wet yourself when you see them for the first time (i.e. finger in the nose) and some can be quasi infuriating at first. I beat the game pretty fast though so I could only give it 3 stars even though thats the only knock on this game.
4,The coolest thing!,"I just got this yesterday along with a GBAsp and can't put it down. You go through about nine or ten characters and must compleate all these intresting classic, wierd, sports, and other types of games then beat a long boss game. after, you get extra games like dr. Wario (dr. Mario), jump forever and chiritorie. The music, graphics, characters and colours and really good and interesting! I compleatly recomend this game!!!!!!"
4,i love this game,"The first Warioware game I bought was Twisted shortly after purchasing my DS. I loved it. then I was at Gamestop or EB Games earlier this week and they had a copy just sitting there in the case. I made my boyfriend ask how mush it was and when he said $12.99 I had to buy it.I really like the game and have gotten to the last level. My boyfriend makes fun of me because the games look easy and I have some major difficulties with quite a few of them. Of course when he tried he did worse than me.I'm too used to Twisted and was actually reprimanded for trying to twist my DS in certain games that were included in both versions.This game is great. My only complaint is that its too short. it takes no time at all to beat the storyline. of course you can continue to play each characters games until you unlock all of them. and its a nice bonus to unlock random games on the side, especially the 2 player ones."
1,A very talented person has cashed out,"One of the brilliant talents RLJ has demonstrated is her ability to weave multi-layed themes into imaginative and thoughtful music (eg The Magazine). I'm a serious fan of her first 4 or 5 records. I'm not impressed at all with this minimalist effort. It sounds to me like the players have barely even bothered to practice for the performance. As much as I appreciate her abilites, I get the impression that this cd was just a way to cash in on previous efforts. Very disappointing."
2,Old Lady Smell,I WANTED to like this so bad. But I just feel like an old lady with this scent on. It's just not nearly as subtle as I thought it would be. Way too strong.
5,Perfect,"This is a very light clean scent. Anyone purchasing this needs to know that up front. This a scent people won't catch unless they're next to you, and isn't that nice? Also the fragrance changes once it dries down, so be patient. It's worth it! Oh yeah, I bought this set for myself and it's adorable!"
3,Amazing Grace,"I bought this kit and was pleasantly surprised to the packaging it came in, very nice, the scent wasn't as heavenly as I was hoping but the products are pleasant, nothing extravagant. The scent to me personally was that of someone older, geriatic. The lotion goes on well, not too greasy but pleasant, the conditioner works great and works well on my baby's fine hair, the bath gel is just like any other, the bath salts are okay nothing to rant about. I like the products however, I just personally didn't care for the scent all that much. I give the entire line a 3 star, again I wasn't overly impressed considering the price."
5,Thank you so much for a fine product.,"My husband surprised me with this gift set and I give it ""two thumbs up"". Philosophy products are one of my favorites and this is a nice package."
5,This made a nice gift .,"I love their product so I think this made a nice gift , and also good for anyone who would like to try this out ."
3,Bodeans Joe Dirt car,"Amazon's service was great, as usual. But, though I bought this CD used, it was advertised in like-new condition, yet the first song won't play all the way through. But it is a 2-disc set, and the rest plays fine.I didn't dig this live CD as much as others, the sound quality wasn't really that good,IMO.It's not terrible, but I wish I'd got he studio recorded album I was initially considering.All in all,though, for the money, I got a good deal, and I knew up front that it was a used,live album,so I can't complain too much."
4,Great effort overall,"Really nice CD - I listen to this one over and over. It's a lot of fun to watch - the whole band is very clearly enjoying themselves, and it shows. The sound is great, the songs all build on each other, and it's a great CD to work out to or drive to.Having said that, I could have done without the ""F Word"" on a few tracks, call me old-fashioned but there just was no call for it!"
4,Great live album,This is a great album by an exceptional band. One of the few live albums I have purchased and actually liked. I have these songs frequently in my playlists.
3,Brief,"This little book has some good information in it and is a good addition to my pagan library. However, I feel that further explanations were necessary and more examples."
3,NOT for lowered vehicles.,"Decent ramps as far as durability is concerned but they're all but useless if your car is lowered. My 1999 BMW M3 has a double adjustable TC Kline coil-over suspension kit and the front air dam bottoms out on the ramp well before the car gets to the top. One other issue worth mentioning: The rubber ""feet"" that are allegedly supposed to prevent the ramp from moving forward during the vehicle's ascent are OK on driveway concrete but they're wholly inadequate on the smooth surface ones sees in a garage. The ramps simply slide (or ""walk"") forward no matter how gently one drives--a task even more difficult for those of us who still employ manual transmissions. I ended up buying a couple of cheap rubber floor mats from WalMart and placed the ramps on those."
2,It moves,"IT should not move. But it does. Which makes it virtually useless for the intended purpose. I suppose there are workarounds. But then it is no longer useful as a quick way to get your car up to change the oil. Also, it's about four inches too low, unless you're a skinny guy or gal. For the money, you're better off paying a little more and getting some good jackstands and a nice little hydraulic jack."
2,DONT'T BUY THESE RAMPS FOR A CORVETTE!!,"Ramps are nicely constructed and delivery was fairly quick, but my understanding was that these would work for on a C5 Corvette. My car has NOT been lowered and has wheels off a Z06 which are also not supposed to affect ride height. The front bumper of my car hits these ramps well before the wheels do making these ramps virtually unusable for me. Very disappointing."
3,OK but not great Ramps,"I bought these ramps because my 8,000 pound capacity steel ramps are heavy, and sink into my grass when I load them with my 7,500 pound Forb Excursion. These Rhino Ramps also sink into the grass, so I have to put sheet material underneath them. They also raise the car up much less than the steel ramps, only about 8 inches or so, maybe less. But they definitely are lighter, so I am using them. The very small front stop at ramp end won't stop my Excursion. I use a Dolly Parton mirror (a wide angle hemispherical mirror you see on school buses) mounted on a tripod, to view the position of my front wheel on the ramp. Also, they were on sale."
4,Blitz Rhino Ramp 12000 Extreme,"Overall quality is very good. However, depended upon how the ramp be located, the RAMP can be slip if the surface does not have much friction."
2,pay attention to dimensions,"Dimensions are confusing/inaccurate. Stated height of 11.5 inches is not correct--perhaps this is shipping container. Actual product is about 8.5 inches high, but taking into account the cradle for tire, only raises the vehicle about 6 inches."
2,Crappy feet,The ramp is strong enough but the rubber feet are crap and will fall apart/slip when used with rear-wheel drive vehicles.
2,Not as good as advertised.,"This ramp is good for small cars. It may be powerful when you get the car up, but first you have to get the car on the ramp! With my BMW 650i, the ramp keeps sliding away and creating dangerous situations. It slid 6 out of 6 time and thank god it slid away from car and did not hit anythung serious, but it can also damage the car. When one slides and the other tire stays half way up, the car is slanted and you are always scared if one of the ramps gets wedged under the car. Then you are screwed really good!I recommend this ramp for light cars with plenty of clearance. I wish they would make one with lower height and longer (lower degree of ascend)."
4,Good product.,The product has turned out well. The bad part was the delivery. When received the first time one of the ramps had a crack in it and a piece was broken off. I sent them back and with in the blink of an eye Amazon had sent me replacement ramps and they were boxed better and in a whold condition.
3,Betsy and Her Friends Have Some More Fun,"It's another fun book about Betsy! This time Betsy and her friends are in 4th grade. They meet Mr. Kilpatrick's nephews and nieces from Ireland: 6 children in all. Everything is fun and funny as usual. Ms. Haywood has a way with finding the funny in ordinary childhood situations. She's like a Jerry Seinfield for children. Well, I didn't really like this book as much toward the end because the children from Ireland told a lot of stories about faries and leprechauns. Before this, except for one chapter of Betsy and the Circus, the author steered clear of any such things. This book is every bit of fun as the other Betsy books. I read it to an 8 and 10 year old and they enjoyed laughing their heads off as usual with these Betsy books. But for anyone who doesn't believe in encouraging children toward magical powers, skip the last few chapters."
4,A HAPPY HAM FAN,"I got this game because I pasted my New York State Math Test.If you want to know how to play,please send me a review about sandy beach.Now I want to know how to make the 3 hamsters that are soccer players turn around.But also you have to tell me a ham-chat that will make the 3 hasters turn around.The first place of where you are suppose to go is Sunny Peak.The second place of where you have to go is Sandy Beach.The third place of where you have to go is Fun Land.The third place of where you have to go is Boo Manor.I'm only up to Boo Manor because I need a couple ID.Can you type a review of that also?I will give you more tips if you give me all the answers of what I typed above."
5,Ham-Ham pals!,This Hamtaro game looks really fun to say so my self I don't really have the game yet but Im going to get it soon and Hamtaro is there to rescue his friends from Spat the mean hamster.
1,It...,...I am a big fan of Hamtaro. I rented the game one night And I beaten it in less than an Hour then I got brored with and said i'm gona return it. Sorry Hamtaro fans but don't buy the game it's a waste of money
1,DOESNT WORK,"i loved this game when i was younger so i wanted to buy it. hence the stars for how fun the game iswhen i got this game in the mail, it did not work. i went to a near by gamestop to check out if it was my nintendo ds lite or the game.they tested both and it was the game. IM NOT HAPPYwaste of my money"
3,Picture Book,"Like the German Army title in this series, a good picture book with a mix of familiar and rare photos. No colour plates however, and little said about insignia or rank structure.Instead, just a solid ""meat and potatoes"" style of book with photos on every page and good captions regarding the uniforms, equipment, some insignia details but not enough, as well as social and historical commentary where appropriate or interesting.Not to be considered a comprehensive uniform guide, just a nice collection of photos that will prove illuminating to both casual readers and serious students."
3,A fun game that stays true to its stop-motion roots,"A thoroughly enjoyable game. A great number of hints and pointers are provided within the gameplay to assist younger players. The humour, smooth gameplay and overall ambience of the game, balance its difficulty and produce a fun romp through Wallace and Gromit's 'Cracking' world. The character animations are first rate, as is Peter Sallis's voice acting. A must for any Wallace and Gromit fan! - October 31, 2003As I have progressed through the levels since October, I have become increasingly frustrated with a) The games various bugs (some of which require a game restart), b) Gromits poor jump accuracy and c) The occasional bad camera positioning. For these reasons, I feel obliged to downgrade my rating from 4 to 3 stars. My final conclusion, after completing 90% of the game - ""Enjoyable but flawed"". - December 3, 2003"
2,Wow really?,This game is alright but it would be a lot better if the camera control wasn't so horrible. The concept of the game is cute and fun but it gets really annoying very quickly. I was lucky enough to find it for $3. It's an o.k. game but i wouldn't have payed full price for it. If i were you i wouldn't pay more then $5 for it. I hope you found this review helpful.
1,"Love the Movies, hated the game","I am a fan of the Wallace and Grmoit series, but the game was a waste of time. The plot was average, Wallace and Gromit's pet polar bear (I think its their pet) has been kidnapped by feathers McGraw and you have to save him. The gameplay kind of reminds me of Zelda (I dont really like Zelda), if you're a fan of Zelda and Wallace and gromit pick it up, but I recommend staying away from this game."
3,an erotic mishmash,"This former best-seller claimed to be a scholarly look into the sexual history and customs of Asia and North Africa, but it is painfully evident that it is really soft porn, and many of the ""facts"" appear to have been invented. It is amusing to read, but it is not a source for serious information."
5,Mind you stogie,"This is a very simple, but useful product. Great for golfing or any activity where you might need to put down your cigar for a few moments and don't have an ashtray handy. The clip is gentle enough that it won't bruise your precious smokes. It's also quite inexpensive. I have one and I also purchased one for my dad."
4,so far so good,"used it twice, and it works like advertised. be careful though, taking the cigar from the clip, it tore the wrapper slightly if you're not careful with it."
2,Good Clip - Bad Choice of Color,"I've lost 2 of these minders because I forgot to remove them at the end of my rounds. And not too surprising, they are never turned in to ""Lost and Found."" Once you clip them on the black pole of your golf cart, the black clip blends right into the cart. What with taking out all your stuff from the cart and discussing your game with your partner, it is easy to be distracted and forget the contraption clipped to your cart pole.Too bad it does not come in a bright color! I believe there are other manufacturers who make similar products not in black and that is what I will be buying next time!"
5,nice gift for golfer,Gave as Christmas gift to brother-in-law who loves to golf. He tells me he's used it several times and loves it
3,Cigar Clip,"This product is cheaply made but effective for it's purpose. Do not know how long it will last, but for the price it is alright."
2,embarrassingly large,"This thing works great, but it's HUGE. On a golf cart maybe it doesn't look so bad, but anywhere else and it stands out like a sore thumb. If I'd realized this, I probably would have just glued a hair clip to a bag clip and called it a day."
3,One step forward One step backward,"I haven't watched all of it yet but so far I like the fact that the entire wrestlemainas were not edited and JESSE VENtura's comeentary is in tact. HOWEVER WhAT IT is horrible is the fact that a lot of wrestlers theme music has been changed and it sounds bad. First No SUPERFLY JIMMY SNUKA, NO ricky steamboat, No SLick ""Jive Soul Bro"" they replaced it with Moonwalker waht a joke, NO DEMOLITION AHHHHHH. that sounds horrible, koko B ware at wM 6 now has Piledriver and not BIRD BIRD BIRD. Big Boss man hard times theme is out and his 200o music is back in, sucks. Those are the big changes i noticed so far."
2,blurry everywhere!!!!!!!!,"I bought this set expecting many things like dvd extras and etc, I have been disappointed because 5 of the wwf dvd's (the logo before) is censured to the public {blurry} and its really annoying, some of the parts in certain dvd's freezes, and some of the music changes too.There are no artwork in the dvd's and there are no cover sheets either {It would be fantastic if any of this suggestions would haved come with the set}Why the wwe would censored the wwf, if wwf was the first logo of their corporation? Next time don't censure wwf please!!!!!"
4,Happy So Far,"I only gave it a 4 because I haven't watched it yet, but as far as price and the packaging, I've had no problems. Then again, I didn't buy mine from here. I went to the mall and got it from Suncoast for $119.99. I was expecting 21 discs, but it actually goes up to Wrestlemania 22. So, in any case, I have no room for complaints."
1,"@#$%. not again, but you do get free extras","once again a screwed with version of an important event. hello may i take your order please: yes i'll have a wrestlemania burger, with extra skip's, extra mutes, extra dent's & scratches & extra, extra blurring...no guts please...and to drink i'll have the freezing point's...i'm sorry i'm outta change...that's ok sir. just to let you know sir this burger recipe has been changed around alot since you last been here. i'm just in aw of how bad they treated this set. no care for it whatsoever. whoever came up with all the ideas for this set should be fired, for such a slop job. this is how you treat us fans for all the years of loyally we gave you. i simpathize with all of us that will or must suffer cause of this. wwe your pathetic, and so is this set. (...) buy the original tapes, & dvds(coliseum video, titan sports video, & wwf home video versions). you'll be better off."
1,Modified from their original form.......,"If your reason for purchasing this DVD is to relive the WrestleMania experience be prepared as many of the original theme music has been changed.The matches back in the earlier WM's are not the great but it is fun to watch the old entrances.....however several themes have been replaced with cheap, poorly made music......examples are Demolition, Akeem, Big Boss Man, Dusty Rhodes, Superfly, Orient Express, and (brace yourself) even Koko B. Ware. That is only from 5 and 6....who knows how much the others have been changed. Rent before buying so you don't fall to WWE ripping off its fans."
5,People are CRAZY,I have read your reviews about hoe horrible it is but i got the new 22 disk set for $160 off of ebay i got with bad intentions but i got brand new(The tag said $249.99)i got home opended and watched not one thing wrong the two new discs were not even a ttached to the top they were in a case together the only problem is that WWE put NO COVER ART but other than that it was the best buy ever i recomend this to young fans because it has all the old and new GLOBAL PHENOMANONS.
5,Stop complaning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Yeah i agree the fact that they blur out wwf sucks but when i got my set it was perfect no defects no nothin so all u complaners (Y2J) SHUT THE HELL UP i mean c'mon it's not that bad i give it a five star rating besides the fact that they blur out wwf but it's alright we should be thankful the wwe even came out with somthing like this i know i am this is like a dream come true for me iv'e been wanting to see these classic matches for long time and i am hyped to see the debut of the deadman the undertaker at wrestlemania and i can watch austin beat the rock anytime i want (WM 15) (WM 17) yeah the rock beat austin at (WM 19) but who cares the score is still 2 to 1 austin but anyway i like all the matches all the disks it's all good so all the wrestling fans out there i would definitely get this box set (mick foley) HAVE A NICE DAY!!!!
3,"It's All Good, except...","The WrestleMania Anthology is cool and everything, but it's the censorship of WWF that really upsets me. I mean, why do they always have to censor that logo just because of some stupid case back in 02? It makes no sense to me at all. Not to mention, most of the music was replaced from what I understand. What's really going on here? If someone in WWE(F, whatever I don't care) had a fully functional brain, they'd see to it that everything was set straight in the Collection as far as commentary, music, and the WWF logo is concerned."
2,keep your nails clipped,"just as all other reviewers are saying its true that these discs are a nightmare to work with. yes granted some of these events are close to 4 hours (more than 3 but less than 4) with the exception of wrestlemania 20 (4 hours 33 minutes). a dual-layered dvd disc can hold up to 4 hours of ""dvd-quality"" video. so the whole 4 hour event should have been one side with artwork on the other (like the wwf wrestlemania 2000 dvd put out about 5 1/2 years ago). people are having playback problems because ""both sides are dual-layered"". wwe why would you do this. lets hope that the next set has artwork on top of the discs. this should'nt be a problem next time as all these other events (rr, iyh, kotr, 8ss, & 11ss) are 3 hours long. BTW: did you notice that when wwe began & wwf ended the product just completely down hill. horrible. goodbye wwf, & attitude era, you'll be dearly missed. seriously. wwe just plain sucks. long live wwf(world wrestling federation) and it's past legacy."
2,Rip-Off,I am huge wrestling fan and when I saw this WM Anthology I couldn't wait to get it. I only bought Volumes 1 & 2 to be fair. I've seen every WM on these disc on the original VHS version and I was very dissapointed. The blurring of the WWF now WWE isn't as annoying as cutting out wrestlers theme songs. I was looking forward to hearing the original music form-DemolitonBig Boss ManOne Man GangKoko B. WareDusty Rhodes etc.I wasn't expecting to hear badly dubbed music over the classic original themes. Like someone else wrote I think the WWE has more than enough money to pay royalties. And a lot of footage was cut out of each WM disc. I don't know if it was WM 4 or WM 5 but in the beginning of the of the tape it shows various wrestlers in their locker rooms getting ready to wrestle and I was expecting to see that too. I'm just upset because I wished the whole set was complete and if wasn't there should've been a disclaimer.
3,Defected!!!!,I got the Wrestlemania set for Christmas. Well i go to put in Wrestlemania 16 and 2 discs are stuck together. I was pissed. I pulled the discs apart and thankfully the original still worked. And oh yeah i hate those damn blurrs!
3,Question Before Buying?,"Before I plunge into buying the entire collection, I just want to make sure that all matches are shown in there entirety & that all 21 Wrestlemanias are here. I actually have Wrestlemanias 1-6 on VHS, totally unedited. I guess I can put up with the theme edits & ""WWF"" censoring, but just want to be sure that all matches are intact.....Let me know!!! Thanks!!!"
2,no excuses now. this set is really worth less than it's being advertised for @ $279.95. so that really means we paid extra $$$$,"wwe should not have a problem now buying the rights to the attitude scratch logo & paying off the music owners for the deleted entrance themes. wwe has sold out all of these box sets in less than 2 months to millions of people. and at $279.95+taxes there is no reason future releases should be tampered with(as they were shown live on ppv aka as-is). wwe grow some and get it done. it's really getting old, and this is going way to far. famous quote from vince mcmahon from the wwf attitude era.....GET IT."
3,Not Worth $200 dollars if there is major editing,"WWE should not sell this item if there is going to be major editing to this product. I'm afraid Wrestlemania 14-18 will be a blurry event. I will have a migrane headache if I have to look at that. Blurring distorts the fun of the matches. WWE better have worked a deal with the World Wildlife Fund and Jesse Ventura or this Anthology is a piece of garbage. If sold ""as is"", This product is 5 stars and a must buy for all wrestling fans of all ages!"
3,Question,A.B.... Is the music sound corny like cheaply put in the dvd or does it seem to go along with the show..\also... is the wwf logo just blurred out like in previous wwe dvds or is it replaced with the wwe logo.. some say it is blurred some say it is replaced.. get back to me on that
1,pointless,firstly why would u need alll the wm when theres more to come i mean maybe next years and next next years wm will be amzing and they wont be in the set think before buying it and aswell maybe some wm u dont like so just get the ones u like. this set is not worth $200 its a cheap scam
2,4 what,This is not a 4 gauge wire. I love how these companies get away with everything. I guess they count the insulation as the gauge of the wire. RIDICULOUS!!!
3,Not really 4 gauge,"As others have noted, this wire is not really 4 gauge. The spool I received is labeled 4 gauge, but the conductor measures 0.17 inches diameter, which is about 6 gauge AWG. If you're looking for 6 gauge it's fine. Otherwise you'll need to look elsewhere for true 4 gauge."
3,Not that great of a product,"I bought this along with some 4ga ring termials. Just be aware that the wire is smaller than regular 4ga, the wire with insulation fit inside the crimp on termials. Compared this to a piece of 4ga I had from an old system and it seems like this stuff is 8ga. Maybe it was labeled wrong or something."
3,Smaller Than expected,"I bought this wire expecting 4guage wire. I have alot of 4 guage in my car right now and it is alot bigger than this new stuff. Although the shipping was pretty good, when i opened the package it was dissapointing to see this instead of 4guage. But none the less, it is a great price and i wish i would have read up on some reviews. i would say this is closer to 6 or 8 guage."
3,"Good wire, but don't expect 4g. It's only 6, at best.","I knew it wasn't going to be true 4 gauge wire, but it was a good price when I got it.It gets three stars for being decent wire. It looses 2 for false advertising. I don't know why anybody would give this 5 stars, since it's falsely labeled."
4,Point Blank 2,"If you like games where you got to use guns (and everyone should) then this game is for you. There are hundreds of levels. For more fun, have 2 guncons. There is no real story just a shoot 'em up game like Time Crisis, Time Crisis 2, House of the Dead, etc. WARNING: If you don't got free time, Don't play this game cause you can't stop. IT BE THAT GREAT!"
2,Precious Babe Pink Dog Kennel & Bed,"Super cute and adorable if you don't plan on ever washing it. Upon first washing on delicate cycle about 12 inches of the plastic wire that holds the frame up came out. The foam sheet that they used to pad the sides, top and crate pad got completely twisted up into weird bulky masses inside- apparently it was not secured to the outside fabric OR lining in any way. The whole thing is one big pink disaster right now and I have no idea how to fix it unless I have a seamstress take it apart and readjust the foam and then see if she can somehow fix the plastic wire.I would recommend only if your dog is 100% sparkling clean at ALL times and you NEVER plan on washing this."
4,A Diffinitive Work,"John Sawyer left no stone unturned in this diffinitive work on the life of Rich Vogler. He captures the driven nature of Vogler's life and search for open wheel excellence. He successfully probes the aloof side of Vogler that so often left his fans and fellow competitors feeling estranged and mystefied. Vogler did special things in a race car, Sawyer has done special things with his pen. (And yes, the pictures alone are worth the price of the book - there are lots of good ones.) Whether you were a Vogler fan or are just an open wheel racing fan, this is a book you don't want to miss."
4,Basic research,Recommended by Adolph Harnack and a good manuscript for research. A good research tool for reaching back to the 2nd century.
5,"Best of all worlds, this one or that one.","I read this book a long time before Oldfield created this soundtrack to the concert, but it fits in every way. What a stunning performance. If you haven't read Arthur C Clarke's Songs of Distant Earth then listen to this. If you have read it then you will be exhilerated by the music. This CD has become a favorite gift of mine, as it seems to have something for everyone."
3,Quite Good,"I bought Tubular Bells as a teenager and remember liking it at the time. A friend had Ommadawn and Hergest Ridge and I remember thinking they were good too. When I saw all the five star reviews I decided to revisit Mike Oldfield. I wouldn't say that I was disappointed - the very distinct guitar voice is still there - but I wasn't moved the way some reviewers seem to have been. I have two issues, each deducting one star: a) there aren't enough original thoughts to keep it going. Variations around the same theme are fine, but these variations aren't that subtle, and b) am I the only person to think this album is Enigma without the vocals? Oh wait, there are the same chanting vocals in places.It's sometimes hard to review a 1994 release in 2010, because you forget what came before, and what influenced what. This is a lyrical album - I'm just not sure how memorable it is."
4,Revisiting,"I originally(many years ago) bought this on tape,I must have let someone ""borrow"" it and it was never returned,and so this CD was like visiting an old friend who I had not seen for years.It is still very good and really worth listening to(unlike some of his later rubbish)"
2,"Where's the Moonlight Shadows, To Frances and Islands gone?","I've heard him play a few songs of this should-be-great album on the Rotterdam 1999 Then And Now concert but after hearing it, as an Oldfield fan, I immediately decided I had heard the whole CD... Where are the rocksongs and good arrangements gone? Never thought Mike would go the tranquill way. Sorry Mike, but I've heard better stuff from you (such as Tub Bells 1 and 2, Guitars, Crises, Five Miles Out, Ommadawn, Earth Moving)."
2,Where have the melodies gone?,"Is he trying to become Brian Eno or what? If it's space music you want, stick to ""Apolo - Atmospheres & Soundtracks"" and you'll be fine. This stuff sounds pompous, self-righteous and grandiose, but the musicwriting is ridiculously weak. The vocal samples, the ""hi-tech"" synths and effects are all gimmicks, throw there to conceal the absolute lack of melodies and musical ideas. Really, it tries to show more than it has. It's a void, insubstantial piece of fluff. And Mike's guitar playing sounds uninspired and dull, as if he's absolutely sure that everything and anything he plays will necessarily be utter genius. I've never heard such a disappointing album in my life. If he wanted to create atmospheres, he should go back and listen to Hergest Ridge, not the latest Enigma albums and try to do a cheap copy."
5,BY FAR the best New Age music ever created,"If you're looking to escape from the horrors of the rat race, which is everyday Life for many, then I hope you turn to New Age Music to take you away. If so, congratulations!!! You have just stumbled upon the best New Age cd I've ever heard, and I teach music for a living. Who cares if they're wondering where your off to with your headphones, turn on this cd, close your eyes, and meditate to truly divine music. By the time the cd is over with, you will feel as if waking from a very good dream, your problems from before a distant memory. This music is true healing. Thank you Mike Oldfield for giving us your heart."
3,"Good, but very mellow.","If you're into EXTREMELY MELLOW music, like david gilmour and such, then this may be for you. I like mellow stuff that is more in the vein of folk or rock. I wouldn't call this either, nor would I call it jazz. I don't think it can really be effectively catagorized--which I suppose is a form of praise. However, I did not really like it. I wish Amazon would have more sound samples!! Oh well, just a warning to others, like me, who maybe are new to Oldfield. Honestly, I just don't like him. But, that doesn't mean it's bad. I would advise trying to hear this before you buy it, though, because it's definately different. Hope this helps!"
4,best game boy ever,"from power on, the game just takes over. compelling story and fun game play. graphics as good as GBA allows. you won't be sorry on this one..."
4,Not a waste of money,"Ok yo wont waste your money buying this game, have good graphics,good control on the ground but when you are in the sea you may get confused with which cannon to fire also that also you get onfused which way to turn in the sea. A short but not bad history and the gameplay very cool you can fire cannons in the sea and have a swords duel in land but if you do not like to duel with swords you also have a pistol (but very limited ammo). The thing that I dont like is that you need to write passwords in order to resume the game (but not a problem). So give a chance to TDK you wont waste money."
5,Love it,I love this game. No effence to the other reviewers but have you ever actually played this game??? It is so much fun! I love it and i am 14!!!! You will love the great graphics and the wonderful game play! BUY IT!!!
2,Barely acceptable,The only reason I gave this game two stars was that the sea battles were fairly fun......the rest was just plain awful.......it came pre-packaged with a GBA (the kiss of death for a game right there). don't bother unless you get it for 50 cents.............
2,whoever says this is fun is really messed up,"I bought this game for a long roadtrip, but was absolutly digusted in it. I though it would be fabulous because I luved the movie. But it wasn't. The only reason i gave this 2 stars was because the graphics were great. The players are slow moving, and it becaimes frustrating because the enemys move faster. Also they are hard to control. I often found myself hitting pillows and other vcarious objects around me in frustration. The levels are super easy. I returned it and got another one in hope that the game was just messed up and the charecters would move faster. HA HA they never did. it was basically a waste of money. I bought Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and found it much betterNOTE: this probaly would work really well for younger people, but i am 14 and it wasn't to my tastes"
4,pirates of the caribean rocks,"okay, when i first saw pirates of the caribean the movie i didnt think it would do good as a game but when i got the game for my birthday it was really challenging and fun."
1,Nothing like the movie,"Most blockbuster movies have games to accompany them. And, though few reflect the actual storyline of the movie, few are this far off. This game goes so far as to paint Capt. Jack with a sense of morality.If you've never seen the movie, have been living under a rock, and are 7-12 years old you would probably like this game. The graphics are decent, and the levels are challenging (considering the short life meter). But the characters and story are polar opposites to those portrayed in the movie."
3,...,"When my brother bought the game I thought it looked interesting and started playing it as Jack Sparrow on the island where he was deserted by Barbossa and his crew. I wasn't too impressed by the way they portrayed Jack. Personally I am really bugged by when video games, books, etc. are not even close to the movie or wherever it orignated. The game itself is rather slow, and I got very bored with it. I haven't gotten very far because of the slow pace, but others may enjoy and play the game as much as the next person."
1,Feels just like foam pads,"I wanted pads that felt like actual breasts so that when I hugged people, it wouldnt feel artificial. However, these pads have minimal gel/water in them and are mostly just padding. Dont buy it...."
3,Fashion Forms Water Wear Push Up Pads Accessory (A/B Black),"Although, I'm a C-cup in European sizes, I ordered this in an A/B, mainly because I had no idea what size am I, in US sizes. I tried out lots of size conversion sites but they weren't much help. I got different results everytime. Anyways, the A/B sized pads were fine. I got minimal cleave whilst using them. That said, I wasn't overly impressed nor was I greatly dissapointed. If anything, I'm indifferent either way. I would've rated them as a 2.5 stars but the half-star isn't an option so I gave them 3 stars instead."
2,Invest in a different pad,"I purchased about 4 pairs of these over the past 3 months and they have all popped and ruined my clothes in the washer. The first one of a pair popped in the dryer (I accidentally put it in there thinking it would be okay) so after that I never put it in the dryer again) but the other 7 of them (31/2) pairs popped in the washer. Honestly I think they would even do this after hand washing, but I don't hand wash things. They need to be washed because for some reason pads of any type make you sweat more. I will take responsibility for the oil like substance that is inside getting on my other clothes, but these aren't made to last regardless of how you wash them."
1,Certainly a book for idiots,"This book was a waste of time and money. The author spends nearly 350 pages revealing things that are obvious to absolutely anyone. He tell us how smiles usually mean happiness, crying usually means you're sad, and faces that look angry.....CONVEY ANGER! The writing style is painful to read. I assume the writer is in his late 70's but trying to be ""hip and with it."" There are aweful jokes through out. He also likes lists and bullets that outline painfully obvious body language rules to follow. How do you tell if someone doesn't like how you're touching them? Are they wincing and flinching? Telling you to stop? Crying? It really goes like this. I couldn't finish this book, you shouldn't start it."
1,Waste of time and money . . .,"This book is so basic and boring. It lacks in visual aids and verbal explanation of the few visuals that it does have. I'll save you some money and some 400+ pages... In a nutshell this book says if someone is smiling they are happy, if they frown they are sad, and if their brow is furrowed they are angry. At the moment my brow is furrowed at the waste of time this turned out to be.'Nuff said."
2,good start - bad end,"This book starts out well and it does thoroughly cover the basics of body language, BUT, the author begins to bring in personal little quips and finally gives in to personal ideologies and theories.I really wanted to learn about this subject but the personal stuff became so annoying that I just threw the book away, too bad because it is a very important to know what is really happening with others.The author says that ""you're no idiot"" but the he presumes to treat us like one."
2,Too academic,The book talks about body language in general terms. I wanted more practical insight that I could apply immediately in my interactions with people.
3,lack of sufficient pictures!,"The book is a piece of art, but it needs a supplement of additional pictures demonstrating eyes & face language!"
1,Open the book when you get it...,"I bought this book as a gift, & only by chance did I open it. The cover is right, however, the pages of the book contain ""restoring collector cars"". Imagine how embarrasing it would have been to give that away. Amazon was great & returned without hassle."
1,This book is not worth the paper its printed on,"This book is complete garbage. When I read the first page, I thought a seven year old wrote it. Bobbie Darden has the ability to bore the reader with his mundane and souless style of writing. See spot run has more passion and grace. The author tries to explain to the reader that women are easily impressed with just flowers and candy, and instantly they are at a mans' feet. If your time is important I suggest you look for another book on the right way to impress a woman."
2,Battle Fatigue,"Disappointing DVD in 4 episodes. #1. Fortress of the Sea: decent rerun of Corregidor. #2. Battle of Manila: too much redundant rerun clips from the first episode. How many times need we watch MacArthur wade in to the beach? #3. Westward is Bataan: disappointing. Has nothing to do at all with Bataan. The film clip is all about New Guinea. #4. Minidoc - two years at war: OK, nothing special.Expected much more about the Philippines."
1,Failed after First Two Uses,"After two successful uses, The device would not seal on the bottle and would spray mostly around the screw top attaching the device to the bottle. Tried tightening more, but to no avail. Ended up throwing it away and just dropping the mentos directly into the bottle."
3,Great Geyser's Ghost!,"This is a great stocking stuffer... one thing... if you use the tube, use all of the mentos! Otherwise, the amount of time it takes to set up the tube will allow the air to diffuse the carbonation, rendering it useless. And if you are not using the tube... why not just buy mentos?"
4,Great Geyser fun,"I used this with my homeschool science students at our weekly co-op day. Experimented with room temp and cool soda. Next time I might use warm soda as well. It really wows them. Be sure to stand back! Pull string didn't work extremely well. I was concerned about pulling the whole thing over, but was able to use it with some patience and adjustments. Have fun!"
5,IT WAS TIME 4 THE TALK!!,Great tool for those parents that feel uncomfortable talking about sex.My son was actually ready to ask me questions!!
3,"Hiding the True Source....Wallace Wattles, Where Are You?","Not to take anything away from Napoleon Hill, but ""The Science of Getting Rich"" was written by Wallace Wattles nearly 100 years ago. Using his title and message for this product and only obliquely referring to ""and other sources"" besides Hill is inherently dishonest. Procter is admired and recognized in his own right for expanding and interpreting the message for a new age. And he's made a very good living at it. Why now hide the original source?"
1,psychological pyramid scheme,"Another one of those... Ever wondered why most of the ""success stories"" Mr. Proctor is presenting on his webpages, in books and dvds, are about people just like himself and including himself? - Yes you can get rich by selling snake oil. Yes, you can get rich by really believing in his sermons and making them your own sermons, and preaching them over and over again while you reach more and more other suckers who want to believe in a simple scheme to become rich. Proctor and many other ""get rich scientists"" are at the top of a grand pyramid scheme that is based mainly on delusion and deception. And we know very well that delusion and deception is the most powerful force not in the universe, but certainly in modern society: Look at the housing bubble, look at the wealth accumulated by the Mormon church, take any other pyramid scheme of you choice."
2,Overpriced and not very interesting,This paperback book of writing exercises is overpriced in my opinion. I sent my copy back as I did not see this as being presented in an interesting appealing way for my 13 year old son. There were lots of pages of writing exercises that are just like the ones in any grammar book. I would have thought that more focus would have been spent on simple leading instruction and examples on improving ones writing step by step with the child's own writing as the focus rather than redundant worksheet type exercises.
3,A little flimsy,I wanted a toilet holder and magazine rack combo in satin steel. I like the look but it's very light and flimsy. Walmart sells a toilet holder that has weights on the bottom which makes it very sturdy. If it had a magazine rack I'd prefer it to this one just because of the weight.
2,Not very stable,"This stand is very handy for keeping crossword puzzles and magazines, but when you use it for getting a strip of toilet paper, it is likely to tip forward a little bit."
3,Disappointed,"Somewhat disappointed in the toilet paper stand portion of the product. When pulling the toilet paper, the roll always falls off. The magazine section is great. Tall enough to hold magazines upright and balanced well so that it doesn't tip in only holding one or two magazines."
4,Worth the Wait,"'The Complete Idiot's Guide to Overcoming Procrastination' is a well written, sensible self-help manual with lots of great advice. That's what my friend Tom Cruise wrote in a letter to me dated November 12 1999. He eventually got around to posting it six months later and I finally read it during the Christmas break of 2001. Anyway, I bought the book at the start of 2003 and was going to read it last week but something happened so I decided to put it off till next month... or the month after. But I'll definitely have it finished by the end of next year. I hope so anyway."
2,Fairly obvious; no psychology,"I didn't find anything too earth-shatteringly innovative about this book.I would have been much more interested in exploring the psychology behind the procrastination. This book is more about ways of getting organized in spite of psychological tendencies toward procrastinating...rather than addressing the root causes of the behavior. There was a SMALL section on this, but it wasn't nearly as much as I wanted.If you are interested in a book about specific strategies for specific procrastination situations, this one isn't bad. But if you're interested in looking at the root causes of the behavior, I would recommend _The Now Habit._"
1,Poorly done . . .,This was so not worth the money. Very little information in a few poorly written pages. What information that is there is available in almost any of the most basic of theory books.
1,Sad,"I'm not really sure exactly what this book aims to do.What it suceeds at is very little.It's poorly written and offers very little advice on ear training. Another one of my students purchases, who learned far more after some simple sight singing than from this.A very basic student might gleam something from this, but this really isn't a eartraining course. I might buy the interval study part, but even that's not done well."
4,I love Sinbad,"I honestly don't think that Sinbad has made a bad movie, Necessary Roughness, Houseguest, Cherokee Kid, Meteor Man, Good Burger, First Kid, Jingle All the Way... I mean c'mon... they are ALL GREAT! Very talented actor and definitely overlooked. Also an awesome CLEAN COMIC!"
3,An authentic form of Hawaiian chants - 1st half is better,"This is quite an eclectic mix of Hawaiian chants. The first few chants are very authentic and sound like they could be hundreds or thousands of years old. But the second set of chants (14-21) make me want to put on my Hawaiian shirt or hula dress, I'm not sure which. I mean they are ok but more touristy with ukelele, maybe slide guitar, etc., definately like an uncontrolled 60's flashback. I'd get it for the first set of chants and skip the others."
5,A mix of both.,Absolutely love this group. These songs remind me of my younger days. This group has been around for a while (and so have I). Looks like they submitted their all time favorites at the last part of the cd. The meles and chants are very well done. Thoroughly enjoyed this.
3,Doe Eyes,"I bought this cd because I love the movie and the Doe Eyes theme song. However, I'm disappointed because the Doe Eyes piece is only about 60 seconds long - and that's it. Even the last cut, which is a reprise, is over before you know it. Plus, not all the songs from the movie (italian opera) are on the cd. It's good for background music while i'm doing housekeeping, and I'm glad I have it in my collection!"
4,"Moving, Emotional, and full of feeling","I love this album!!! It hardly ever leaves my CD player. The slow jazz and bright instrumental pieces are full of feeling and takes one to another time. ""Doe Eyes"" is the theme of the movie and the music of this moving orchestrated overture is enough to bring one to tears, for it is so beautiful! Wonderful!! I highly reccomend it with no drawbacks!!"
5,I can't stop listening to it.,"I had just seen the film on tv and I wanted the original sound track. I couldn't find it here in Spain so I trusted the Amazon description and bought it. Now i just can't stop listening to it, it is so soothing...and my cat loves it too!"
2,Disappointingly slow pace and lack of in-depth content,"As a lifelong resident of Iowa, I was excited at the prospect of watching this tape and I recognized most of the names of the towns and some of the scenes. However, the pace of the tape is so slow that it could be a partial cure for insomnia. The music track is sedate to the point of being acceptable background music in an elevator and there are significant gaps in the narration. Furthermore, some of the images are maintained longer than is really necessary. I found it so boring that I had to watch it in segment approximately 20 minutes in length. With so much material to work with, it was disappointing that the producers chose to go slow when they could have sped up the pace and covered so much more information about a state with so much to offer."
4,english,these are in English dubbed right? im just curious before i buy. the price is reasonable. let me know when you get a chance.
