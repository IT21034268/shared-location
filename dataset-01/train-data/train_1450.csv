3,Okay,"Decent read and nice limited look into 12th-century England, but the evil characters were way over the top to the point of being not believable, and the depressing parts far outnumbered the uplifting ones."
1,I don't get it,"I first tried to read this mess 10 years ago. After Tom, starving to death in a frozen landscape, has hot porn-star sex with a mystery woman in the woods, I threw it away as garbage.Then, my otherwise well-read parents kept telling me about how they just loved this book, and I read about how Pillars is Follett's masterpiece, etc. So I picked it up and made it half way through this time. Yuck.One night I put it down and picked up Bernard Cornwell's ""Agincourt"" and re-discoverd why I love reading and historical fiction. There was more nuance and joy in the first 10 pages than all of Pillars. Here is the ultimate problem with Pillars: there is no humor. It is a relentless series of calamities and tragedy borne by unhappy, humorless victims.Not worth reading."
1,Trite piece of erotic filth,"How this book made Oprahs list is beyond me. Obviously she never read it. Follet obviously has some pre-teen girl rape fantasy issues, because that's what he seems to dwell on the most in great detail. Even better, the final conclusion drawn by a main character is that her childhood raping is what made her a successful woman. Hows that for womens lib?Follets knowledge of the timeperiod is limited to snippets of info inserted almost verbatum from other sources. There is very little in his characters that embody aspects of medieval life or philosophy. It's a simplistic, obvious story with no real twists or turns, and it could be transported to any time period simply by changing a few words here and there. I'm embarassed to have read it.If you like poorly researched medieval porn, this is certainly the book for you."
1,Porn and Violence For the Reading Level of Sixth Graders,"I'm so disappointed. I wanted to love this book but the writing is chokingly elementary in form and depth, graphically sexual and violent, and historically inaccurate. It's hard to slog through and not be simultaneously bored and horrified. Did anyone read this book at the publishing company? Is this really what we've come to as adult readers?Where is the complex character and plot development? Where is the command and usage of at least a tenth-grade vocabulary that would also be keeping with the time period?I heard so much hype that I expected to sit down at a Thanksgiving feast. If this was it, all that was served was fast-food. I'm worse for having dined and completely unsatisfied."
2,boring,"After the first hundred pages or so, you get a lot of monks talking to monks ad infinitum. Follett quickly kills off Tom's first wife in order to get him to Ellen. Contrived and too quick. I found the book mostly boring and contrived."
5,Grabs you from the first chapter.,"History has not been a great interest of mine, but i could not put this down. Pillars of the Earth made you understand the social and environmental conditions that had to be dealt with on a day to day basis and glad that we live in this day and age.i'm thursting for the second volume in the series."
5,Riveting,"Ken Follet's book is one of those novels that I crave, but often have difficulty finding. In essense, it is a historical novel that I completely immersed myself into, only periodically emerging to look up facts about flying buttresses and English kings on Wikipedia. A splendid read."
5,The Pillars of the Earth,"Heard this reviewed and recommended on Oprah's Book Club. Although it was written quite a few years ago, Oprah had recently read it and so glad I heard her review. I've always enjoyed Ken Follett, but I think this was his masterpiece. A thoroughly enjoyable read."
4,The Pillars of the Earth,"Ken Follett is a wonderful writer, there are over 900 pages in this book which I would usually put on the back boiler to read. However, this book was so interesting, I could not leave it down. On the negative side, there is a tremendous amount of violence and sexual content and it is extremely graphic, hence I would not be able to watch if it were made into a movie.HelenW. Nyack, NY"
3,Why all the hype?,"I think this could have been a great book if it were about 500 pages shorter. While I enjoyed reading it, I was in no way mesmerized and just wanted to get to the end. I thought there was much too much graphic violence and often found myself skipping pages just to avoid the sadistic rapes. I found the characters very stereotypical: a God-fearing monk who somehow always came out on top, a scorned lover who could only seek revenge by spending the rest of his life torturing others, an innocent girl who succeeds in life despite all the obstacles in her path and a dysfunctional step-family. Quite frankly, I kept thinking this would make a great ""guy"" book; the topic and characters seemed like they would be more appealing to male readers.All in all, I would recommend giving it a try...if you have plenty of time and a strong stomach. I just received the sequel as a gift and can't say that I'll get to it any time soon...I just don't have the time for another 900+ pages."
3,"Good story, but not great literature.","This is an enjoyable, easy reading book full of memorable characters and interesting peeks into Medieval life. I don't consider it great literature -- some of the writing made me crazy--but overall, it's an interesting, engaging story and one I liked."
2,Would have been better if he finished it.,"The first 80% of the book moved along but he must have run out of gas, The last part didn't resolve all of the characters and what there was was rushed."
4,Wonderful read,"This is an excellent book. It tells a terrific story that will capture and hold your attention. At the same time, amazingly, you'll learn some really interesting history and architecture while Follett's rich rendering of the time and customs will allow you to ""experience"" the book, if you know what I mean. You'll feel a part of it, rather than a witness. Enjoy."
3,"Good Plot, Falls Short on Execution","""The Pillars of the Earth"" is everything you would expect from a thriller writer turned historical fiction writer - a gripping story, but lacking when it came to prose. I had trouble taking the book seriously when phrases such as ""What a woman!"" came up in the text. The modern words and names belied the novel's antiquity, which I can imagine helped some readers with accessibility - it was rather a turn-off for me. Still, such a complex and satisfying narrative deserves four stars."
4,Wonderful Saga,"I have not long completed reading this book for the second time. I first purchased it when it was released.Second time around over 15 years later it is better than ever.If you love sagas with meat this is for you. There is love, romance (not too mushy), war, conflict, hardship and more. The book is for all genders.This is a historical novel so you would have to be keen on this type of setting.Basically if you want a book to get your teeth into that is full of everything this is a great novel by a great author."
5,Great historical narrative of 12th Century England,"I have been a Ken Follett fan for several years, but I admit I had not read 'Pillars of the Earth.' However, I decided to tackle the story and was immediately drawn into the pathos of 12th century life in England. It was a time of great turmoil politically and with church in Rome, and this is what makes the story so good, so believable.Follett uses historical settings, historical characters and events and then blends them so expertly, fact becomes immersed with fiction.Yet in the end, goodness trumps, which show even today, good people, will rise to the occasion regardless of cause.Pillars of the Earth is one of the ten best books I have read, and hope it is still on the bookshelves 100 years from now because it is as good accounting of history, of people, their lives, situation, loves, dreams, trauma, and sorrows as any on the shelf anywhere"
5,NGlorioso: Pillars of the Earth,The best book I have read in years. This book gets better and better the further along you read. Twists and turns that keep you guessing and rooting for people and feeling for them through every one of their struggles. Hoping the book never ends but it must and it leaves you wanting more.
3,The Pillars of the Earth,"The Pillars of the Earth was the pick of reading groups all over the country once Opray added it to her book club list. I found it tedious, over illustrated with poor characterizations other than the technical architectural description."
3,Pillars,Did I enjoy this book? - Yes.Was it too long? - Yes.Was there too much repetition? - Yes.Was there too much sex? - Yes.Give it a three.
3,"OK, but try Norah Lofts.....","I like Ken Follet, especially his earlier books. Pillars of the Earth was good; I don't regret reading it. I love them long and it was certainly that. I read a Norah Lofts book called A Wayside Tavern that was very similar, but much better. It traced an English tavern from 400-1970. I found it much more interesting......but I love Norah!"
2,Underwhelmed,"I am surprised that so many people raved about this book....perhaps my expectations were too high. I found the preface by the author to be more interesting than the story. In one word, SIMPLE. Simple dialogue, simple plot. I kept trying to find depth with the charactors to no avail. The whole story is one-dimensional. Interesting time and place but there was nothing compelling about it."
2,Boring,"Surprising. For an excellent, entertaining author that has to be one of the most boring books I have read in a long time. It just goes on and on. Had the author used the language of the period, the story might have been easier to consume."
1,Not the Worst Book Ever Written,"...but it should definitely be on the list. Every reviewer who has given this trash one star has already covered the ground, but I'm so mad at myself for actually reading the Whole Book, that I must add my two cents.Obvious plottingOne dimensional charactersAnachronistic language throughoutGratuitous violenceLame writingSilly nonsenseMy mother would have called it ""tripe"", and I suppose they would have understood that word in the Middle Ages too.I just read the first few pages of ""Wolf Hall"" by Hilary Mantel, set a few hundred years later and about that other King Henry and that other Thomas. What writing! and What a difference."
5,you cannot put it down,"I have read it twice so far and enjoyed it tremendously both times.It has it all - romanace, trechery, arquitecture, medival life, fighting, military stragity, every page makes you turn another and you hate to put it down."
3,Dismayed,"I was somewhat dismayed upon reading this book. I had heard so much about it that I couldn't wait to buy it. The author was on the Oprah show. Oprah and the audience led one to believe it was the best book ever written. Maybe it is just me, but it just wasn't my ""cup of tea"".The story is o.k. but not even close to the hype that came out about it. I won't even bother buying the sequel, ""World Without End"". It may be my fault for thinking it was so great from listening to the Oprah show. I have bought other books she has recommended and have been disappointed. So maybe I should have known better."
3,"A good story, well told","I liked Pillars of the Earth and am glad I took the time to read it. It's an interesting look at medieval life and the main characters seem very real. On the flip side, it's a bit overwritten. I did a lot of skimming over certain sections, more like speed reading. However, I highly recommend this book for anyone who's looking for a good story to keep them occupied for a couple of weeks."
5,Wonderful story,"Although I was intimidated by the number of pages, I've read this book's Spanish translation in much less time than many others with only 200 pages! The story draws you in; it is well connected and interesting. It is like a serious version of a soap opera placed in medieval times in England, which teaches you many things of that place and time. 100% recommended!!"
5,Worth the Time,Buy it now! This was the best book I have ever read! Follett uses his vivid imagination to paint the picture of life in the 1100's. Every word will have your full attention. Try to put it down!
1,Ye ole Bait and Switch,"I thought I was entering into a great work of historical writing, based on reviews and recommendations. Instead, it was unedited boobies and rape scenes galore, with a little Cathedral Architecture 101 thrown in. Bleh! I read all kinds of books, I'm not a literary snob by any means. But don't tell me I'm getting a serving of chocolate mousse and give me a mud pie instead. I'm so bitter."
1,cant finish it,I chose it thinking it would be very interesting. The idea of cathedral building in the 1200s sounded fascinating. In the beginning the story of Tom the stone mason and his family really got to me. But then I got bogged down with the monks and gave up. I may go back to it. I rarely give up on a book.
1,Maels opinion,"I do not care for this type of book. Too violent for me.A friend recommended this book highly, to each his own."
5,This book offers something for everyone.,"Through this book you will enter a world full of love, death, war, religion, rape, birth, survival, tragedy, family, magic, and so much more."
5,Outstanding book,This was one of the most engaging stories I've ever had the good fortune to find and enjoy. Not a short novel by any means but a sprawling and engrossing book. Thank you Mr. Follett!
5,Grandes estrelas para um grande romance! / Many stars to a great novel!,"É um excelente livro!Ken Follet nos faz viajar no tempo com seu romance histórico. Além de uma narrativa intrigante, é facil perceber o imenso embasamento histórico que o autor possui ao escrever tal jornada. Um grande conhecedor dos hábitos e jogos políticos da idade média. Fabuloso!It is an excellent book!Ken Follet makes us travel back in time with her historical novel. Besides an intriguing narrative, it is easy to see the immense historical basis that the author has to write such a journey. A connoisseur of political games and habits of the Middle Ages. Fabulous!"
3,Give yourself a long time to finish this,It had me and lost me several times throughout the book. It does provoke an emotional reaction towards some of the characters. Entertaining but not one of his best.
2,I really tried...,"I so wanted to like this book but after 100 pages or so I just gave up. The book is heavy like a bible full of so many unnecessary and redundant details. It's like someone is trying to read a story to you, not a book you get to digest and enjoy. I'm ok with a big book like this and people are free to write a 1,000-page book, but doesn't mean that 300 pages of it you can just throw in whatever on top of your head without editing them. I'm sorry but maybe I'm not quite there yet to appreciate this so-called masterpiece, but I just can't."
2,"""utter dreck"" is exactly right.","I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this book - the world is fun to be in, even if it is described in almost clinical detail. I am also not a prude, but there is something about being inside that lecher's head that I found violating after the 3rd gang rape description, and I decided to go onto another book. The detail in all of the rape scenes really didn't move the story, nor did they do anything but reiterate that this character is a horrible person. I felt a little like I was peering into the author's inner demons. No thanks.It's a shame, because the inner weaving of the character's lives is very interesting, and there are a few characters that are fun to be with, but after a while, I just stopped enjoying it."
2,Well-researched? I don't think so,"I am surprised at how many people refer to the historical nature of this book and how 'well- researched' it is, etc.Very early on in the book, that sort of praise for this book is proved to be undeserved. Follett refers to a thief being hanged as being ""..quite young, somewhere between twenty and thirty years of age...""In Europe in 1128, 20-30 years of age was 1) a huge age range and 2) certainly not young.On page 55. of William Manchester's book about the medieval world, _A World Lit Only by Fire_, one learns that 40 years old was an unlikely age to reach and that most people died well before the age of 30! Those who did reach ages 40 and older were like today's octogenarians, white hair, hunched posture, etc. So, how could 20-30 in age possibly be 'quite young' ?All Follett had to do was a little bit of research to avoid this error."
1,Because 0 Stars aren't An Option,"I see that two other memebers of my on-line reading club have already chimed in on this piece of junk. OK, we academics may not be the best reviewers of a work of historic fiction, but I'm appalled that so many people rave about the historical accuracy of a book that is so deficient. Maybe it's good beach or bathroom reading, but it doesn't rise to the level of literature, and it's way too long to be this bad."
4,Great book!,"I didn't realize how long this book way because I read it on my Kindle - but it didn't matter - I couldn't put it down. The story is do deep and thick with emotion and real characters that you can't help but find yourself completely entranced. I need to take a breather before I read the sequel, but it's definitely on my list!"
4,Very enjoyable,Took me a while to get into Pillars of the Earth. Sure glad I stuck with it. Very facinating and enjoyable. Thanks
2,Pillars of the Earth,"I did email the source for this book--felt the price I paid for just a regular paperback was high. Thought when I ordered it would be a larger size paperback, but it wasn't--and between the price and shipping, felt $15.00 for a $4 book was a lot. He sort of agreed, but apparently he paid more for it as well. Book was in good condition."
4,Pillars of the Earth - a review,"I realy enjoyedthis book despite its length - over 9oo pages. It was a bit violent at times for my taste, but totaly in keeing with the era in which it took place (12th century). I have recommended to several of my friends and have already ordered its sequel. Although a totally different genre than usual for Ken Follet, it stills uses his attention to detail and his ability to transport one to the location and time."
5,Could not put this one down....,Never read any of Ken Follett's books until this one. Loved this one so much went on to read WORLD WITHOUT END. Could not believe I could get so wrapped up in the building of a catherdral and the middle ages. I will never look at a catherdral in the same way again! Highly recommend!
5,"Great book, but why does Oprah's edition get its own reviews??","After all, she didn't discover the book. The world's most over-exposed woman didn't start her stupid book club until 7 YEARS after ""The Pillars Of The Earth"" was published!! Thank God I was able to scrape her lame sticker off the cover!!Saying that, ""The Pillars Of The Earth"" is one of the finest historical fictions I've ever read. Having visited a few of Britain's abbeys and cathedrals a few years before TPOTE, when I returned to the UK more than 10 years later, I reread the book before my trip. I revisited Salisbuty Cathedral, Bath Abbey, York Minster, and the best insight to the pillars in the Earth, the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey. I subsequently visited Norwich, Canterbury, and Durham Cathedrals, and though I'm irreligious, these structures are breathtaking. I took my best friend on my last visit to Salisbury, and when she knelt to pray, she was moved to tears by the majesty of that ancient building."
5,Best historical novel I've ever read,"Actually I knew this novel for quite sometimes, but i have never considered to buy it the first time.It is because of the 1,000 pages plus and the medieval story.Then i was attracted to the text on the cover of the book, which is ""international bestseller"".Then i think if the book becomes international bestseller, there must be something about the story.So i bought the book and started read it. And i couldn't stop reading it.For me the story it is like took me driving around among the historical characters, figures and events.It is worth the time."
4,To Build a Cathedral in a World Full of Violence,"A fictional account that concerns the lives of various people involved in and around the building of the Kingsbridge Cathedral. Set against the backdrop of civil war in medieval England, the story includes elements that capture the violence and confusion of the times, including rape, murder, arson, war, and political intrigue.There are wasted words in this lengthy novel--the author tends to rehash excessively--but the overall narrative is engaging and the characters are well-developed.World Without End is Follett's follow-up in what can be loosely termed a series."
5,HIstorical and Entertaining Read,"Having only read one of Ken Follet's novels back in high school (Eye of the Needle), I was expecting something of a mystery thriller, however this was not quite the case. Although not widely publicized in the United States until perhaps now, this novel seems to have developed more of a cult following and is often advertised via word of mouth (which is how I learned of it). A thematic departure from the rest of his work, this novel is possibly Ken Follet's best, combining years of historical research and beautiful character development. Although I was initially skeptical about reading a book about the building of a cathedral, it surprised me with the political, religious, and personal stuggles that are as entwined in the cathedral as its stone and mortar. It is a wonderful read. I would also recommend watching the 8-part mini series based on the book after you are finished!"
3,pillars of the earth,clever. unique. bit to long and cumbersome at times. violent as was most likely true of that era.
3,Overwritten & Underdeveloped,"There were too many pages involving useless plot development, and not enough time spent fleshing out the multitude of characters he managed to write into his story. The book was well written, but he said too much and too little throughout the entire book. None of his characters were particularly compelling. Instead of making the characters interesting and developed, their flaws were obvious and overstated.All in all, it was an interesting book, if only because it took place over an extended period of time. He had an easy to read writing style, and the book lacked the pretentiousness that others in this genre seem to possess. I won't sell it, but I'm not going to be re-reading it any time soon."
3,"Eh, it was all right","I'm glad I got this book at the library. I thought it was merely ok. It held my attention while I was reading it but I had no problem putting it down. I never really got attached to any of the protagonists. And about halfway through the book, I was tired of reading how the bad guys are bad. I get it, they are evil, now can we move on and do something about it? There are a lot, I mean A LOT of details about building the cathedral. I kind of expected that based on the synopsis of the book so I just skimmed over that as there was less than 1% of those details that had anything to do with the plot. Overall it was a good way to kill the spare time in the last two weeks and I may have gotten my hopes up based on my friends recommendations. I don't think I'll be reading the sequel though."
2,Modern Vernacular in the 12th Century?,"The author has been praised for his research on this book, but the way the characters think and the descriptive words used are indicative of our modern era. For example, one of the character's thoughts describe sexual intercourse as ""doing it""....really? Very weird for me, I think my expectations were way too high. I am really disappointed. It is like watching ""Valkyrie"" and trying to ignore Tom Cruise's accent."
4,The Pillars of the Earth,I have barely gotten started on this book but am looking forward to reading the entire book! Intriging!
5,Best book in a long time,"One of the best books I've read in a long time. Wonderfully written characters, and for almost 1000 pages, the plot moves along very quickly."
4,The Pllars of the Earth,Fast read - excellent storytelling. Loved the descriptions of the building and how the characters interact. Never a dull moment.
3,Good book but a little long,"This IS a good book, but it was a little exhausting because the same scenario kept happening over and over again in the book. It's a little slow in the beginning and a little overdone at the end, but otherwise the story line is great. Most of the book I would say is a ""I can't put this down"" type of book, I only gave it a three because a few of the parts made me say, ""Here we go again."""
5,One of the Best Books Ever,"Anyone who has ever seen me with this book that has read it themselves always comments that it's either their own personal favorite or one of their favorites. As a flight attendant, I've said the same thing to several passengers who have been reading the book themselves. I've highly recommended it to other people, and everyone rates it as one of their all time favorites, if not the best ever. I didn't think it sounded quite like my type of book, but my best friend (who is really girlie and a bit prissy) and her husband (who doesn't mind hunting and is always doing guy things) both recommended it to me and couldn't say enough about it. Considering how different they each are, I thought I'd give it a try. So glad I did."
3,The Pillars of the Earth,"I love historical fiction, and someone recommended this book to me, so I bought it despite the fact that it is very long. I did enjoy the book, although I felt that at times it dragged on a bit. Most of the information about the construction of the church was very interesting, but I felt that a lot of the book could have been cut out. Despite that, it was a good read and gave you a lot of information about life in England at that time."
1,Oprah must get kickbacks from the publisher,"I swear Oprah must get some type of commission or royalties for recommending certain novels for her book club, because I've read about four of her selections and they are all god awful, and this one is no exception.I love historical fiction, and I am by no means a literary ""snob"", I just like an entertaining read with interesting characters, and I love to learn about historical periods. This book was such a disappointment. The characters were flat and one dimensional, the language was too modern, and Follet drones on and on about architecture rather than developing captivating plotlines. I am no historian, but did anyone else think the characters were just a little too educated considering the fact that most of them were peasants? It was just hard to get into the characters because they kind of peaked early on in the book and then flattened out to the point where they were just boring and annoying."
1,waste of time,I don't care about historical accuracy - I was looking for a story with strong characterization. Tom's character was interesting - so was his 'girlfriend' - but too little was devoted to this part of the story. The 'gratuitious sex and violence' was annoying.
2,Pathetic that people say best book they ever read.,"This is a dreadful book, unbelievable, needs massive editing and a good writer. It's an interesting story and should have been written by a good writer.When people say it's the best book they ever read, it is indeed worrisome.I am a very fast reader so could read it quickly but for anyone to spend much time on such dreck when there is real literature out there is pathetic."
2,Vivid and pornographic,"In the introduction Mr. Follett indicates he followed his agent's advice to create a 'series of linked melodramas'. That seems an accurate description.The story is loosely based upon historical events in twelfth century England. It does show evidence of some background research.I do have an acute disappointment in this novel, because it could have been a great work.The rape and torture scenes are titillating, detailed and seem an exaggeration of a formula to create focus points. Ironically even within the text the author has Philip lament that it will be very difficult to purify his mind of such filth.Even the other tensions seem very much formula driven, the same pattern each time: despair, a great hope and seeming solution, then the 'bad guys' win and partially thwart the hero. The hero soldiers on. It reminds one of 'professional' wrestling.Same scene- just change the costumes for each round."
3,"Very good, but not awe-inspiring","A very interesting story woven within an interesting historical backdrop. It was interesting to follow two family generations trying to achieve their inspiration of completing the Knightsbridge Cathedral.However, I thought that the book was flawed in a couple of ways: the characters were somewhat too one-dimensional, many of the incidents that occurred were predictable to a fault, and the story seeemed needlessly lengthy towards the end.All in all, I would recommend it to anyone I know. I would just warn them that the initial joy and page-turning excitement might wane somewhat by the end of the book."
5,No comparison,"This is Follett's best by far and I'm just waiting until they finally decide to make a movie out of it. Eye of the Neddle is the short, compact thriller; this is the long, languid historical novel."
5,Fantastic Book,"This book allows you to travel in time to the building of a cathedral. You feel the lives of the people who are the builders, and the other people in their lives. An amazing adventure."
3,"Good, but by far not the best","A woman at the bookstore told me that this was one of the best books she ever read, and because the plot appealed to me, I bought it - I love historical, epic novels. I was somewhat disappointed, due to the fact that I didn't feel as if I was there - the style of writing and the way the characters spoke didn't make me think I was back in that time period. They were far too modern. Another disappointment was at the end when William of Hamleigh met his end - I would've much rather had the author tell it from Hamleigh's point of view. All in all, an interesting book, but not the best."
2,Can I give 2 stars if I didn't even finish?,"I actually agree with the one stars. But there were some bright spots. Still, I couldn't get through the horribly inauthentic language, for instance, that the characters used.. I just don't picture people of this time period saying that someone was ""hot"" - or many other 20th/21st century vernacular phrases that showed a blatant laziness on the part of this author. It took even the faintest bit of authenticity out of it for me. I couldn't get lost in the story because the inattention to detail was so distracting. After seeing the reviews here, a friend also recommended it - before he'd finished it - so I purchased it. By the time he got to the end, he was sorry he'd recommended it to me. I agreed, and decided that reading this was not a good use of my time, so stopped reading it about two-thirds through. I even banished it from my Kindle. Bleh."
2,Could have been so much better!,"I had read this book a long time ago and purchased it so I could read it again. I was so disappointed this time around. I personally thought the sex scenes were really drawn out and even unnecessary. I realize that some of them were part of the plot, but they certainly didn't need to be that long and descriptive. For me, they detracted from the rest of the book.Other than that complaint, the book was an OK read. The story was magnificent -- how much egos can clash in medieval England on the way to building a gigantic cathedral. It wasn't very artfully written . . . the rich storytelling just didn't seem to be there for me, but it did an OK job relating the plot. The fact that the plotline was so well-thought-out was the saving feature of this book. Everything makes sense, and the plot is good, but the writing just wasn't all that impressive."
5,"Exciting, Well Written, Informative","""The Pillars of the Earth"" is a exciting read. Although it has some dark passages, I hated to put it down. One fascinating situation follows another and they are all eventually tied together. Although fiction, I get the impression it is a pretty good depiction of life in the 12th century in England.There is a lot of discussion about the design of churches of the day in the United Kingdom and Europe, particularly Cathedrals. I found this informative and interesting, things to look for and appreciate when visiting these churches."
1,Not available to Australia,I would dearly love to read this book but unfortunately it is not available to Kindle owners in Australia for copyright reasons. I sincerely hope Amazon will look into this issue as there are so many titles that are unavailable to me. It is a shame I didn't know about the copyright issues before I bought my Kindle... I may not have been so eager.
2,Slow service.,Took a very long time to ship out to me.If you need it quick I would not order again from them.
1,Pillars of the Earth,"I never received the book. I e=mailed the sender but she never responded. I want my money back, and if this is the way Amazon operates, I won't be ordering any more books from them. Susie Johnson"
5,thrilling history,"I didn't know what to expect in this book, but I love it.The way the church and the law were at odds was suprising.The common man had it really hard.Can't wait to see how it ends."
5,"Fantastic, mesmerising, unputdownable!","This is a fascintating account of the 12th century and while it may be gory in places, the truth of the matter is that these things really did happen and are still happening. The Pillars of the Earth gives you an insight into human nature and if people really were like that in the 1100's (my guess is they were), we really havent changed all that much in 800 years. An absolute must for fiction lovers and don't let the size daunt you, it is worth it."
5,The best,Great reading....draws the reader into an amazing time long past. When new books bore me....I listen to the unabridged cd again.
3,"good, but could have been better","I don't see what the big deal is about this book. I read it because everyone gave it such high praise, but i found it a bit boring. The only other Follet I've read is Jackdaws, and that was vastly better than this. To a degree, his research is interesting, he describes the setting very well, and if you're into cathedrals and the middle ages and knights and political power plays, then you may enjoy it. But the language is jerky and unimaginative. The characters were a little 2 dimensional, Brother Philip being the exception. I loved jackdaws because every triumph was met with a new twist (break into the room only to find the enemy standing there, that kind of thing) but i got the impression he just wrote this without knowing where it was going. I think if he'd lost a couple hundred pages (it's about 1000) it would have been a lot better."
1,Oprah picked THIS?,"I took this book on vacation with me, looking forward to a satisfying read. Was I disappointed! Overwritten, ridiculous plots, corny descriptions, inauthentic dialogue- awful! A jumped up romance novel.If you want to read a wonderful book about the middle ages, Sigrid Undset's Kristin Lavransdatter is the gold standard to me. It's a rich tapestry of the time, authentic in every way, educational without being boring, and filled with unforgettable characters and events."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,I ordered this CD set and had it within 24 hours. Amazon is amazing. The prime discount is my favorite feature. I hope Amazon never changes this offer.
5,Unpredictable,"I picked up this book several months ago and finally had the time to start reading it. I am very glad that I did. I had my qualms about reading a historical fiction work written by Ken Follet, but all of those were crushed within a few pages of reading.Aliena, Jack, Ellen, Richard, William of Hamleigh, Richard, Prior Philip, Tom the builder, Bishop Waleran and the other characters become as real as my own friends, family and less-than-friends.I had trouble predicting what would happen next throughout the entire novel. It constantly had me wondering why men could be so evil, as though the storyline was happening in real life. There were plot twists when I thought there could be none left.I was a little distubed at parts of the book with the rape scenes that occured; but they became integral to the entire storyline. I would highly recommend anyone who loves historical fiction or who just wants something different to read this novel."
5,Rich portrayal of medieval life from the people in England,"Well written description of the early church and its politics, life and values and the revival of the church and its cathedrals."
2,"Books needs ratings like movies for explicit sex, language, and violence","I read a few Amazon reviews before purchasing this book. I wish I had seen the review by Ash. I agree that this book is ""Utter Dreck"". There should be ratings on books just as there are on movies about explicit sex, language, and violence. I wish I had not read this book and can not possibly finish it.SHAME ON AMAZON for not putting warnings on books like these!"
5,A top 5 book of all time,I read this book in lieu of studying for finals senior year of college (12/89). One of the best books I have every read. Have been waiting for a sequel for 17 years.
4,Easy read.....,I loved this book the second time around as much as the first. Mr. Follett gives life to the cathedral as each chapter unfolds to dramatic characters and scenes associated with the construction of a massive building. If you are taking classes in architecture or the dark ages you will appreciate and understand the key words in his descriptions. I can't wait for the sequel.........I hope it is as page turning as Pillars of the Earth!
1,Much turgid melodrama in quasi medieval setting,"The main protagonists are ostensibly medieval people with very modern sensibilities in a setting with the trappings of 12th century medieval England by an author with very little understanding of the actual world.The big secret the chief villains go to such lengths to conceal is a conspiracy that assumes the conspirators could foresee the consequences of what they conspired to so they knew what the immediate consequences of their deed would be.Piffle.That kind of foreknowledge is deadly to historical fiction; it plants the author right in the reader's field of view.All this swirls around the building of a gothic cathedral. If that's what interests you, read David Macaulay's Cathedral instead. It's much shorter, is better researched, and is accompanied by nice sketches."
2,Grim,"Couldn't get through this one. After buying and getting half way through it, I learned that it had been recommended by Oprah. That surprised me given how tedious and violent it was. I even taped and watched some of the miniseries episodes, but didn't want to waste my time watching the last few. Historical fiction has always seemed like a relatively painless way to learn something if I'm going to spend hours reading, but this one was just too burdensome. I can't believe this cost several dollars--what a waste!"
3,Decent,"I don't get all the attention this novel has received. It'll keep you interested, but the characters seemed somewhat one dimensional to me. They're either pure evil or completely benign. I had a hard time picturing them as real people and getting emotionally attached to them. It's probably worth reading to see what all the talk is about, but, for many people, it won't live up to the hype."
3,Its fun and engaging but...,"For the amateur medievalist it is interesting but one has to wonder how much investigation Follet did into this period of time. I ofund some of the dialogue and narrative somewhat contrived.In all though, it was a good book. And for those who enjoy this period, go for it...!"
4,Just a few inches short of a home run!,"Well what can I say that the other 150+ reviews hadn't said already? Well, I can say that for the first 450 pages you'll be enthralled! The characters and the ups and downs of their existence will captivate you! But, soon you'll start to get the uneasy feeling that things are becoming repetitive as you celebrate one more victory, and then, yet another defeat. Eventually, you'll start to get the feeling that a great ending is impossible. Alas, it is true. A book of such heft should not have been wrapped up so quickly and neatly. Never the less, you'll enjoy this book and will willingly forgive the letdown. After all, how can one keep a grudge against a loved one after such a marathon session. Buy it, you'll like it, and you'll be happy to share it!"
2,Historical Pop for the TV era,"Follet is a competent storyteller but he is betrayed by his compulsive pandering to the lowest-common denominator. This has the feel, the texture, the depth and the authenticity of those old 70's TV mini-series, full of romance, betrayal and as predictable as the four seasons. It has some merit, as pop pulp, coarsely written and very much aimed at the middle of the bell curve, but it is disturbing seeing so many people labelling it as ""the best book ever"". What books are this people reading? I don't mean to be disrespectful, and I am sure their devotion is sincere. What's more, I think that Follet is due some credit for telling a story that uses all the possible archetypes in fiction and manages to pull through a ton of pages, but... Even for popular fiction, this is simple-minded, digested and very much low-aiming stuff. It is puzzling to me that so many readers find this ""the book of their lives"". It makes me wonder about our lives, what we read and what we aspire to."
4,History turns real,"I found this book facinating. I'm thrilled at the incorporation of King Stephen, Empress Maud (also known as Matilda) and the mention of Elanor of Aqauatain (towards the end).I was also delighted to see that the violence of the time was properly placed, with out going over the top. This book gives a very realistic overview of several lives in the period and give the reader a probable understanding for what daily life might have been.It's a long read, but it's clear and written in a tone that is easy for the reader to sit down and enjoy the plot."
4,The Pillars of the Earth,Something about this book grabs you very quickly and you don't want to put it down.
5,My favorite book of all time.,I have always been a fan of Ken Follett. This book is very long but it flows very well. It takes you on a journey encompassing the lives of a family and others over the course of generations. A very well written and researched book.
1,Odd mismatch between content and style,"Started off well, but in the end the disjunction between the story and the expressions of the partipants got me annoyed. A little tantrum after what was presumably a shattering prison visit just didn't ring true. Gave up soon after that."
1,Great Book Too Small Print,"Wanting to read for the third time. Ordered this particular version not realizing that for this size large publication that the print would be so small that i returned to reorder a ""regular"" version of Pillars."
3,Historical (-),"It is an ok read but, thank goodness it is kept at a local part of Europe. From a Native American's aspect, it's typical of how white people treat each other. It has been out a good while, will not take the time to read anymore of this authors works. Good luck to him, there is a definite place in authorship for this kind of writing. I may seem a little unfair but, not my way of writing a historical novel or PhD research."
3,The Pillars of the Earth,I started out liking the book very much. As I read further I found it to be repetitious and too long.
2,It Was Okay - No Big Deal,"I can't believe how many people think this is the best book they've ever read; it's just a time passer, nothing more. It's certainly no masterpiece. The prior ""permitted himself a smile"" every couple of chapters and we were reminded constantly that Aliana had a ""dark mass of unruly curls."" Also, whenever food was mentioned, someone's mouth was bound to ""water."" The writing was horrid! There were so many conflict-crisis-climaxes that by the end I couldn't care less."
4,I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down.,The story unfolds in a 30+ year span and you really get to know and like -and dislike- the characters. Unfortunately it has several very unnecesary details on sex and violence...
3,Interesting Story Line...BUT,"POTE is far too long, it had more than a few slow spots, it became predictable at times, and in my opinion it was somewhat repetitive. I couldn't wait for this book to end. POTE does not live up to all the hype and it's not something I would recommend."
5,Superior,"I could not read to the end of the actual book because it was too heavy in weight and because my eyes are getting too oldand tired. Kindle was the answer, for me, to reread and finish this book."
5,book review,"One of the best books I've read! Full of fiction and nonfiction drama, intense characters and spectacular cathedrals from 12th century England."
5,Remarkable,This is one of the best books I've ever read. Ken Follett is an amazing author. I can't wait to read the next one.
1,Not the origanal printed book,"Thought I was buying the book which I have read many years ago, only to find that this print left out many pages and sections from the origanal print. Not happy, but I finally found an origanal print locally that I purchased. So this one will just sit on my shelf and colllect dust!!!"
5,Great book!,It is a very long book and it took some time to get into it but once I did I did not want to put it down.
2,Poor,"I don't really feel like I'm in the middle ages when reading this novel, the language used, whilst making the book an easy read, is too modern in part and leaves me feeling a little isolated. However, its easy to devour a large chunk in a short space of time, so worth persevering with."
2,Plodding plotting,"A disappointment. Slow, plodding, uninteresting and just boring. No real mystery, no deep character development and minimal insight into the thoughts of 12th century folks. Try something else for historical fiction. This one doesn't do much."
5,Outstanding,"The Pillars of the Earth is an outstanding epic novel covering several decades and multiple generations of a family. I got almost nothing else done for the week while reading this, and I have no regrets."
1,Cheapened a story with graphic sex,"The premise of the book was a great idea and the story could have been great. However, the writing style was not exceptional and it was overdone with detailed graphic sexual context. Follett cheapened his own book so instead or writing a masterpices (as he said he wanted to do) he just made a cheap book under the guise of literary fiction. Too bad..why would one suggest this book to one's daughter or son? Very disappointed"
1,A waste of time,"This was a very disappointing read, the writing is crass and hamfisted, and the attempts to incorporate significant historical events with unconvincing characters is amateurish. Steer clear if you are genuinely interested in history and love good writing. No subtlety here. I would give it no stars if that option was available."
1,Wildly inaccurate rubbish,"This novel was recommended to me by a friend, and I bought it based on reviews on this site. It purports to be set in the twelfth century, which, however, appears to have unaccountably time-shifted to the late 20th. century. For example, women are described as ""hot"", and 12th. century boys appear to know all about monkeys (this was in a largely illiterate era when there were no published books, no TV, and no public zoos, Mr. Follett).Other historical details are way off - Old Sarum Castle has apparently moved itself 6 miles so it's located conveniently next door to Salisbury Cathedral.The final straw for me was that my paperback copy had a full back-cover color shot of author Follett(taken by his wife), looking like a very self-satisfied chipmunk. I couldn't stand any more after 65 pages. Absolute balderdash. Avoid this book. Mine will be in the Laguna Beach Library used bookstore if you want a cheap copy."
2,Not Follett's best,"I recently reread the book for a book club and, after six hundred or so pages, just couldn't take anymore. The book has not held up well. The characters are very one-dimensional, the melodrama is redundant and Follett passed up several opportunities to be far more interesting. The plotting is not always organic and often very predictable. For example, Ellen begins as a wild and mezmerizing spirit, but after a quick roll in the hay with Tom Builder, becomes a dull domestic character. William Hamleigh repeatedly attacks Kingsbridge. Bishop Waleran repeatedly plots revenge against Philip. Anything that could possibly go wrong here does. Ellen and Aliena are pretty much the same character, as are Alfred and William Hamleigh. This period of history is fascinating, but there are much better tellings of the tale out there."
1,A huge waste of time!,"Very, very disappointing. This will teach me never to listen to reviews....An epic piece of ...., incredibly and unnecessarily long, very predictable, characters are too stereotypic. A trashy novel set in the middle ages....really, why? Pornographic descriptions of sex which I really did not enjoy reading, and the detailed discourses on cathedral engineering didn't get me, either. I should have borrowed the book at the library and not paid for it to have it on my kindle..."
4,Worth Your Time and Money,"As I write this, I am about to purchase the sequel, thus I can easily recommend Pillars to you. Pillars has it's flaws but it is an amazingly fast read for a 900 page book. The story unfolds rapidly and enjoys many plausable twists and turns. The characters become real for the reader and I found myself cheering them on. I must admit, however, that the ""bad guy"" Earl/Lord is overplayed in his repetive actions to destroy one women. Near the end I found myself saying ""oh, come on,"" as the Lord's bad behavior is repeated at least one to many times. Having visited the actual English cities and churches depicted in the book, was an added plus, and made my visualizations all the more real. I look forward to meeting the key characters again. Go for it!"
5,Amazing!,"I just finished reading this book for my Humanities Summer Homework assignment and I've never enjoyed an assigned book more than this one! I hate reading, especially books for school, and I could not put this book down. The story line is very well written and the cliffhangers make you want to read for hours on end. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good novel! :D"
4,The Pillars of the Earth,"An excellent story set in 12th Century England. Follett does a great job of describing the religion, politics and society of this interesting time in history and he does it with fascinating well developed characters. If you like historical fiction and have an interest in the middle ages you will love this book. Stick with it because it gets better and better as the pages go by."
3,This book made me angry...,"The book is well written - if you want to learn how to build a church. The details of that process go on and on. The character development is adequate enough to get you involved with them but the interaction between the characters fall short. Still, I enjoyed the first half and really got my hopes up for the rest of the book. Then, 2/3rds of the way through, one of the main romantic storylines, that had, what I felt to be, one of the most pivotal parts of the book, ended up to be a couple of pages long and then went back to the intricacies of building, blood and pretty much all that had gone on in the first part of the book. It was a total let down and left me really discouraged to read the last part of the book - which I have yet to do because I'm so frustrated with how this has progressed.I know I'm in the minority in my negative review, but if you're looking for a heartwarming book with lots of human interaction, this is not for you."
5,Pillars of the Earth,"This book is daunting to pick up and begin reading. However, I am glad I did. I read this book in under three days, an accomplishment for a book this size, I believe. I never thought that I could find priests or builders interesting, but I did. This is due to the fact that the author brought the character's alive. I enjoyed the book wholeheartedly, and would recommend it to anyone who has some spare time and an interest in good historical fiction."
3,Epic is right!,"Honestly, I never thought this book would end. This book was on my shelf for years. But it was so huge! It was not until I could discretely read it on my Kindle that I decided to make the jump. I love historical fiction, and that you get with this book; and boy do you get lots of it...it never seems to end. There are enough spoilers and negative reviews to give you the spirit of the book. Am I glad I read it - yes. There are some terrific one * reviews that mock the book. I personally do not think a book needs to be this long. If you are like I was, and it is one you want to cross of your list --- then read it. The book is enjoyable, just long, but buy a kindle because you will be taking it with you everywhere!"
4,Pillars of the Earth,"I've read only the first 500 pages so far, but love the character descriptions - so vivid. The architectural aspects of the cathedral are also described in great detail. A good read, despite its length."
2,Not that it is all cracked up to be,"I have to admit, this is my first Ken Follett reading. I was not thrilled. Almost put it down to stop but decided I wasn't going to waste my hard earned money by blowing it off. I think teh recent attention is overblown, I can NOT believe it is on Oprah's bok club list. The story line is a little weak, predictable. Good and bad cahracters all too familiar, nothing stood out as great by any means! The historical content is interesting. I usually rip through a book that I enjoy, done in a couple nights. Here i am 4 weeks alter, still struggling to finish it, almost done, but I am cheating. When I get to a drawn out fight scene, I skip the two or three pages, to the end of the fight and pick up there. I just want to know how it ends and have a feeling it will be predictable, cheesy. Whatever. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
4,"Drama, not diagrams","Despite all the great things I kept hearing about it, I was hesitant to start this book because I thought it would be a heavy, pedantic tome on the mechanics of cathedral building. Instead, I got a delightfully suspenseful medieval soap opera. I found myself cheering for the downtrodden villagers and the pious, yet practical Brother Philip as they took on the evil Earl William. Recommended."
3,The pillars of the earth,"I have this as an audio book. It is unabridged (which is my preference!).I have recently become interested in historical fiction and this is very good, it lags in some parts but quickly resumes and the political plotting is very interesting. There is a little too much focus on ""how to"" build buildings but not so much that it takes away from the story. The central family's struggles and the way life was at the time is interesting and appears to be thoroughly researched. Overall very good!"
3,A bit of a soap opera,"The plot was what kept me going through this book. But I found myself skimming over a lot of the description and endless mental hand-wringing by the characters.I learned some things about the medieval period, but I also thought the characters weren't medieval enough. Their attitudes and thinking seemed pretty modern to me. I often felt I was watching modern actors performing in a medieval setting.Way too much graphic sex and violence.Overall, too much like a soap opera. There were so many reversals of fortune I got whiplash. By the end had I stopped caring about the characters, because I knew whenever something good happened it would be quickly followed by a disaster or I would find out someone has to wait even more years for something they wanted."
2,Bad guys against Good guys story,"The two stars rating (instead of one) is owing to the impressive architectual descriptions of the cathedral. The historical descriptions were OK but the rest was truly disappointing. The plot repeats itself over and over again. The bad guys attempt to ruin the good guys. The good guys prevail. Then the bad guys come up with a new plot to ruin the good ones . And over and over again. The characters are all one dimensional. The language is too much 20th century for a 12th century novel. The sexual descriptions are at times almost vulgar. The romantic parts are truly shallow. It reminded me of a Daniel Steel novel. Not that I have anything against Daniel Steel, it just wasn't what I expected from ""without doubt Ken Follet's masterpiece, and a story for all time"" (from book backcover). Besides, if you want to write this kind of novel, you can settle with 300 pages top. Don't torment your readers with 1000 pages looking all the same."
1,Depressing,"A sequence of frustraded hopes and dreams. Even real life is less cruel. Depressing. As you read this book page after page you read about the worst in human kind and one scenario after another relates frustrated dreams, human cruelty, missery and depravation. Only bad people succeed one time after another. Very very undermining for the spirit."
5,More More More,"I can hardly belive that I have enjoyed a history filled book so much. All the detail of the building and the travel, extraordinary. From the first time you read of Jack you want to protect him. The power of the church is just terrifying. Highly Recomended to all who want to get lost in the middle ages."
5,excellent,"i bought the unabridged CD because i drive a lot, and this one did the trick - i can't wait to get back in the car to pick up where i left off. i will even sit in the driveway to finish a chapeter! the narator is perfect, and the historical detail merges with the emotions of the characters, so you never fell that you want to 'skip the dry parts.'"
5,Difficult to put down,"Follet keeps all the characters stories running and intertwined, you care about them all. I am currently reading World without end and story just as engrossing. Kindle version makes size of book more manageable."
3,It was ok...,Yes I read the whole thing and I kind of don't know why. the first 3/4 of it are ok and then the ending was just too short. It seemed like the story crashed.
2,"I don't agree, Oprah.","I've had a hard time with some of Oprah's choices, but this sounded like something i would like. After 500 pages i'm still not engaged in this story. i don't really like the characters and i don't think it's very well written. if you want a long, exciting, sexy story with characters that you would love to have in your life, try Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. Pillars just doesn't compare."
1,Disgusting,"The first two reviewers giving 1 star were absolutely right. I am saddened that so many people are stupid enough to believe that because gratuitous sex and violence held their attention for nearly 1000 pages, this must be a good book. It is absolutely disgusting, poorly written, and badly researched. I completely regret the hours I spent reading it."
1,A terrible waste of my reading time.,"This book is five times longer than necessary and readers are rewarded little for their effort. A much more entertaining book about the dark ages and rennaisance is William Manchester's ""A World Lit Only by Fire""."
2,A potentially great story ruined by a superfluity of smut,"While I did come to love prior Philip and was intrigued by the herculean task of building of a grand cathedral in Medieval England, I was distracted by the modern-day language, the simplistic writing and the shallowness of many of the central characters.In many ways, this was a good story. I believe that, in the right hands, it could even be a great one. But the author seemed to revel in raping, pillaging and groping his characters almost as much as he focused on the meat of the story. As a reader, I really didn't need to be reminded--repeatedly--how much body hair, booty or bustline a character possessed. I wanted more storyline and much less gratuitous smut.A disappointing read after reading such hallelujah-laden reviews.In a nutshell, me no like."
5,Best Book Ever,My favorite book of all time. So glad when the sequel came out. Hope there will be a third book.
5,Excellent Story - Life in the 1100s,This was a great story. I normally don't read alot because I have trouble with books keeping my interest. WOW ..This one kept me coming back. All 978 pages of it. This is the greatest book Ive ever read...So many great characters and they were easy to keep track of..
3,Pillars of the earth,"A little slow getting into the book. Haven't had time to get very far. Have heard that it is an excellent book, so will further review after finishing. Rated a 3 because haven't read the entire book yet."
5,The Pillars of the Earth,"This book is wonderful! I bought it as a member of a book club and was somewhat intimated by its size (970+ pages), but found that it went too quickly. I could have read more! Set in England, in the 1100's, it tells the story of building cathedrals, about monasteries and monks, bishops, kings, earls, etc. Yet, it wasn't about religion per se. I highly recommend it to anyone who has the time to read."
5,"Wonderful, Amazing, Spectaular","This is an amazing book!!! It kept me spellbound for the entire 970 something pages and wanted more. If you enjoy stories set in the era of kings, queens and knights you will LOVE this book."
2,ugh,how can I get the 6-8 hours I wasted on this book back? And I never finished it. It was painful.
1,Pillars of the Earth,This magnificent and volumus work has been ruined in its publication using a print format that is so cramped and small the I have to discard it un-read. Frankly it should be withdrawn.
5,One hell of a book for a desert island !,"Ken Follett excels in this saga of 12th Century England. The constant events of its pages and wonderful characters jump out at you and made me wish i could have written it. I have read the author's other books but none have come anywhere near to matching the scope or adventure of ""Pillars"" - it would make one hell of a movie. Since books have a tendency to go out of print I have bought a spare copy for my old age."
5,page turner,"When a friend recommended the book, I was a little hesitant. I had no idea what to expect. But I now believe that this was well worth the time. Pillars of the Earth, although not historically perfect, is a mesmerizing piece of fiction. I truly could not wait until I got home from work to read more. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something simple and moving. As for the question of historical accuracy??? forget about it. It will only ruin your experience!!"
2,Not all its cracked up to be,I got about 500 pages into this book and just could not keep reading. It felt vert repetitive to me and I had a hard time getting interested in it. At times it was interesting but it just feels like so many events continue to be dragged out to long. This is a book thats very long but I feel that the story could have been told in fewer pages.
3,Interesting setting but long and contrived plot,"This book started strong but after a few hundred pages I started getting frustrated by the plot elements of the story. Characters started doing things seemingly more because it made for an interesting twist than something they would actually do. The villians were interesting at first until I realized they were going to be permanent fixtures over the entire span of the epic story where, plot after evil scheming plot, gets foiled by the heroes. After a while I just started to roll my eyes as yet another impossible test gets set before the Phillip.Much of the story was spent documenting the evil deeds of the villians who, rape after rape murder after murder, continue on and on. I get it! William is evil!Not that I didn't enjoy some of the suspensfull elements of the story, it just got old after a while and even became predictable. I liked how the author portrayed the time: economics, politics, technology (especially architecture), social hierarchy, etc."
1,disappointed threw book into trash,Enjoyed Eye of the Needle and others but this book was a horrid waste of precious time. One star is one too many.
1,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews here I was so looking forward to this book. Major disappointment. The pace is very slow and the battle scenes are too much. The sex is written as a sixteen year old boy would write them. I'm slogging through, hoping for more, at page 650 or so. I may throw in the towel."
5,Many twists and turns,A very well-written and lengthy historical novel with many twists and turns and excellent character development.
5,Simply the best book I've ever read.,"I've read this book twice and am thinking of reading it a third time (as it has been a few years since I last read it). This book is absolutely magical. It has all of the elements of a great novel: passion, deceit, jealousy and intrigue - to mention a few! This book has set the standard of writing excellence that has yet to be surpassed. If you have not read it - do so. It's that good."
5,Incredible. Wonderful book.,"This story is set in 12th century England. While the storyline is built around the building of a cathedral, the real main story is the struggle between opposing forces. On the one hand, you have Aliena, the daughter of an Earl, vs. William Hamleigh, the son of parents that took over the earldom.The other struggle is between Prior Phillip, who runs the monastery in Kingsbridge and Bishop Waleran Bigod.The two struggles are interwoven in this story along with a host of other characters. The number of twists and turns in this book is high. Each character is developed to a point where you really get to know them deep down inside.This book is worth the time to read it. It is very well written and engages the reader. Enjoy."
5,Page Turner plus,This book was hard to put down. I always enjoy reading a story and learning something about history at the same time. Ken must have done a ton of research for this book. Excellant.
5,My favorite book I have read,"This was a book that I could not put down. It was like a drug to me. I learned about what life was like in the early 1100's in England. It is a great story that takes you through all the emotions humans have.Our lives today are full of many conveniences that we all take for granted.After this I read ""World without End"" by Follett which is takes place in the early 1300's and it was just as good."
5,Still the best book I've ever read,I loved this epic novel. the first fifteen chapters describe the scape and characters from then on you will be swept up in a time that was both brutal and beautiful.
5,"A way to read, pray and fight . A mystical adventure.",I was about to start producing the videogame of a cathedral builder when my boss gave me the book. I loved it and read it in 10 days and night. Easy litterature but give somany idea about mediaval time that I surely will produce someday this video games...
1,Does Follett have an editor?,"Does Follett have an editor?, February 10, 2008By B Bard (California, US) - See all my reviewsThis book might have been good if some editor had taken a sharp knife to it. It is just turgid. Did Follett get paid per word? I have always liked Follett- he is usually a crisp, tight, inventive writer. I was profoundly disappointed in this & its companion book (I made the mistake of buying both at the same time). I suppose if you have insomia, this might be a cure, but I will be hesitant to purchase another of his books. Save your money & find something else to read."
5,Pillars of the Earth,Great work. Excellent story lines and interweaving of the plot and characters in period England. His historical facts seem accurate to boot.
5,Strong Pillars,This is a grander than usual tale with strong characters and set in a well defined landscape.Well worth reading.
5,Fantastic,I was given this book by my sister and was not disappointed. This type of book is a change from my normal reading selections. I liked it so much this is the second time I've read it and am looking forward to reading the sequel.
3,Wow - that's a long book,"I started reading this book in June 2012 and finally finished it in January 2013. I kept getting distracted by life so I was not able to sit down and read it from cover to cover. Overall I liked the book, the characters were complex and the author did a wonderful job of intertwining their fates together. Not sure that I would put this one up for a book club read, but definitely one to take on vacation."
3,Lovely story...,"I love the story, it's gripping. But after reading The Game of Thrones series, I find that the author is jumping around the story a bit, still very entertaining, but sometimes it seems the author is in a hurry to get to the point."
4,"Long book, but very good read!","You definitely learn a lot about churches and architecture that you may not have been prepared for, however, this story is really great and is worth taking the time to read!"
3,Be prepared to read a loooooong book,"The story was interesting but sometimes the descriptions of scenes were too long, this was a very long book and at times I just wanted to get through it."
1,s-l-o-w,"Oh....I read this to put me to sleep. Poorly written, boring, really bad dialogue,not a single surprise. Really really dull. I gave it a star just because the site made me choose."
5,Brilliant,"The Pillars of the Earth was, without a doubt, the best book I have ever read. Ken Follet has succeeded in bringing the golden age of cathedrals to life. His characters are beautifully developed, and his attention to detail is superb (I especially liked how he based last names on occupation). Could not put this one down!"
5,Fascinsting trip back to medieval Europe,"A great historical novel, even more mesmerizing than ""The Triumph and the Glory"" and "" Cold Mountain"" each of which knocked me right on my___ they were so good. Which isn't easy to do, I've been a round the block once or twice and read a book or two in my time. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Pillars of the Earth, it is Follett's best ever."
3,Happily ever after,"Ken Follette's novel is not without merit, but face it folks this a big storybook for adults. There are some stirring moments but this a ""black and white"" book with no gray areas. The good characters are good the bad characters are bad. As far as historical significance this is hardly a blueprint for the middle ages but does offer some insight to Christianity's hold economicaly and culturally on Europe and more specifically Great Britan. It's great fodder for a screenplay, Star Wars set in churches."
3,The Pillars of the Earth,"I guess with all the hype, I expected more. At times it was a very boring read."
4,you will be shirking your responsibilities.,"This book is so engaging right from the very start. I am not the most avid reader, in fact I am a bit dyslexic and read slowly, but The Pillars of the Earth is so enchanting that I have become addicted. I'm not finished reading it yet, and I will be sad when I am. It's not the most poetic or descriptive or complex novel, but it is a well researched novel of historical fiction, not sensationalized, and I like nothing better than that. The plot can be a bit predictable at times, but the characters are rich and dimensional and the novel unfolds well and makes you want to curl up and read and read for years.Don't watch the miniseries first! It's not good at all, but it will be fun for a giggle after you read the book."
4,More mystery than history... enjoyable.,"This is an epic. An epic set in 12th century England that attempts to convey a story about the intertwined lives and conflicts. The story, very cleverly, uses the building of a cathedral as the anchor or glue to bind all the sub-stories together. One story is that of Tom, a skilled builder whose life ends ups meshing with that of a monk, Phillip. The story then moves to the next generation, i.e. Tom's stepson Jack. What is amazing about this story is that it effortlessly uses the backdrop of medieval England without allowing the history to overwhelm. The focus is on the characters and their lives, not the history, which is used more as embellishment."
5,Incredibly gripping introduction to medieval England.,Ken Follett - do the sequel. James Cameron - do the movie.
3,Disappointment,"I was disappointed by this book. It started out interesting but by section 2, I was beginning to lose interest. The characters were lost as the stressing of the church architecture began. The characters were left hanging during this period, but were pulled togehter at the end. After so long I nearly forgot who they were. The ending was predictible. I don't see what the attraction was in this book. If our power hadn't gone out in a big winter storm, I am not sure I would have even finished reading it."
2,predictable,I thought this book should have never made it to Oprahs list. It was so predictable and the characters so cliche. I am very very disappointed. Corny story at best.
4,good but sometimes boring,i really enjoyed this book over all but in some spots it was really boring. as i read this book at some points i didnt want to put it down at others i dreaded picking it up. if someone were to ask my opinion on this book i would tell them to be ready for a long and sometimes boring book that you will look back on when you are finished and say wow.
3,Finishing poor elaborated,"I've read it twice, first time in spanish and second one in english and the two of them I've finished the book thinking about how a marvellous history can be ended up that way (!!!). It looks like if Mr. Follet didn't know how finish it. I think it's a pity 'cause I liked very much... until the last 50 pages."
3,Interesting historical novel,"I found the historical content of the book, the building of cathedrals in England in the 12th centrury, very interesting, and I learned a good deal. However I found the book, as a novel, tediously written, full of creaky and obvious plot twists and thinly drawn characters. The book is twice too long for the story it tells: it could be cut in half and work much better as narrative. I found it annoying that the author does not provide any notes: what sources he used for his information, what characters are fictional and what are drawn from historical sources, etc.But the author is famous, writes prodigiously and sells a lot of books, so who am I to criticize?"
5,I have read it twice and plan on reading it again!!!!,"As a lover of historical novels, this rates as my all time favorite. It makes one appreciate those artists who designed and built the enormous cathedrals. It gives new depth to an Art History class."
5,A Breathtaking Novel,"Every once in a while, I check the reviews of this book to make sure it's getting five stars. That should tell you something right there... no, not that I have too much time on my hands. :) This is a truly amazing book. If you react to it like I did, you'll read parts that will absolutely make your jaw drop. You'll go through a whole range of emotions... especially for the characters. Some you'll love; some you'll hate. I've even seriously considered naming future children for characters in the book. With all the other reviews, it's pretty obvious that this book is something special. If you're looking for something new to read, dive into this. You won't need to come up for air until the end. And, for those of you who have just finished the book.... BREATHE!!!!!"
1,No Keeper,"I don't mind reading books with 1000+ pages, but this book was definitely 500 pages too long (and these ""golden eyes"" just became very repetitive after a while).Unfortunately I had bought the hardcover version, so I kept reading, hoping at some point I would get into this story, but it just became less and less interesting.Well, I thoroughly enjoyed Ken Follett's ""Night Over Water"", ""The Needle"" and other WW II thrillers and I read lots of historical novels with close to 800 or more pages, but this one just doesn't do it for me.Of course I will continue reading Ken Follett, just not his historical novels. And definitely not the sequel to ""Pillars of the Earth""!Certainly not a keeper (I sold my copy at a yard sale later on)."
2,An exercise in tedium,"Follett slogs along where Michener or Kingsolver might have soared. Michael Crichton gave us more excitement and far more valuable historical insights in ""Timeline."" The ongoing theme of cathedral building is a compelling notion, but the author's handling of the characters and their interaction eventually becomes as tedious to read as the book is weighty to hold (nearly 2 pounds in its paperback form.)"
5,Excellent Reading,I could not put the book down for more than a night sleep. What can I say? READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Times are the same but only a different time & place or year.
1,Pillars of the Earth? I think not: medieval bodice-ripper.,I don't understand how reviews of this piece of overburdened tripe can be so glowing. This is VERY POOR writing-after page 10 I wished they would all get killed-it was impossible to feel empathy with any of them. Honestly he goes on at length when unnecessary and there's barely a moment of interesting cathedral -building to be had. Could have all been told in 300 pages but would probably still come up short. Rutherford's London is a much better read.
3,"Mixed bag, but had to finish it.","It's really a mixed bag for me. Some things seemed really authentic, but the plot is just over the top. I found the stuff about medieval society, monasteries, and cathedral building fascinating. The plot, at times, is very captivating, but a few of the turns are incredibly contrived. Also, there are a couple of scenes of sexual assault that I found just utterly repellent, detailed way beyond dramatic necessity. The characters are interesting, but they make some incredibly illogical and uncharacteristic choices simply to support the plot, and postpone certain obvious outcomes (like any good soap opera). And yet ... I had to finish it, see how it all turns out. For all its faults, I did find myself transported, and cared very much about the characters."
5,Superb!,If you have any sense of history at all and even if you have no idea this a book that will put you there. You will identify with one of the characters and be transformed into the middle ages. Enjoy!
1,Corny,"I realize this book has been out for sometime. But I just read it and found it a very corny story, which tries to please the 21st century reader with a story set in the 14th century. The author is trying to create an epic, but fails miserably. When I read this book, I realized even more the genius of Hemingway, Hugo and Steinbeck."
4,Lovely,"Very well written, engaging story about a number of different characters. Pulls you in from the beginning with it's superb storytelling and entertaining voice. Also quite interesting due to the historical context."
4,as good as on paper,had in on paper years ago and needed something to read while traveling...still entertaining and a pageturner..a must have in your belletristic liberary..
5,A great read,"Since recently reading this I've been recommending it to everyone...despite its being originally published almost 20 years ago. Kept my interest throughout, all 900 plus pages. No romanticizing past times here, just the raw data and descriptions of 12th century life as it was...a continuous struggle to meet even the most basic needs. The corruption of the church, the tenuous reign of Kings, and relationships within the classes is all depicted. Then we get to learn how these magnificent cathedrals were really built. The craftsmen and workers each have their story. Depressing at times? yes, but that's because Follett pulls you in to caring about the lead characters, feeling their anguish and rejoicing in their brief moments of joy. Don't miss out on this!"
3,"Highly entertaining story, decent historical background","Follett's writing offers continuous action, so this story is hard to put down. There's enough historical detail and realism to make this a more worthwhile use of time than reading thrillers.This is neither fine art nor a historical masterpiece, but it's good fun. The story is woven with many subplots of political and personal rivalries and multiple love stories. There are logic gaps and oversimplifications for those who want to find fault, but you'll need to look hard because Follett has done his research well. Few of us are experts in cathedral architecture.There's a cult out there that raves about Ayn Rand's real estate developer hero in Atlas Shrugged. Folett's The Pillars of the Earth is a vastly more interesting and more satisfying book.The Pillars of the Earth is too long for an ordinary airplane flight, but might be perfect entertainment for those flying to Europe. I enjoyed it thoroughly and passed it along to my dad."
4,Great book,I really like reading in my kindle and finding good books as this one. I recommend it if you like adventure stories full of history.
5,Excellent!,"Being a reader of contemporary mysteries and the like, I never imagined myself actually reading a historical work of fiction, much less one a thousand pages long! But I've always liked Follett and decided to give it a try. Now that I have finished, I am so glad that I read this wonderful work! This is for anyone who has a heart and a desire to capture the essence of the past. To leave today behind and go back in time to a period when church and state were at odds with each other. When good vs. evil ruled supreme. Great story, great characters. You owe It to yourself to read this book!"
4,The Pillars of the Earth,"I was recently in Europe and viewed many of the ancient cathedrals. A man in the tour group expressed his disappointment that the laborers that contributed to the building of these magnificient monuments were not remembered. This book is a tribute to them and to the difficulties of their lives. If this book is true to the lives of the people of the middle ages, then those that survived were indeed the strong. Also, this book demonstrates how little people have developed from those days. I'm not speaking of material changes. We still have war, murder, rape , greed, and power hungry individuals."
3,"Repetitive, but interesting","Grabbed my attention from the beginning, but it seems only because there was nothing to repeat yet! So the story goes: good vs. evil, evil wins, good overcomes...good vs. evil, good prevails, evil makes another attempt...good vs. evil, evil wins, good overcomes...for a span of forty some odd years! I could only have so much treachery, lying, and debauchery from a limited amount of characters. The writing was very simple; if Follet wished to shorten the length by 300 pages, he could have simply left off the constant summarization of what he wrote earlier in the book. Bottom line: liked the idea, liked the story, far too dragged out, with the actions of the characters and people not matching up to what we were led to believe about them. But again, it's fiction. A bit too soap opera-y for me."
1,Does not deserve one star,"It reads like a bad soap opera. It's shallow, amateurish, inconsistent, absurd and unbelievable. The characters, language, events, thoughts and motives could not possibly be representative of the setting. Probably the information on cathedrals and construction is somewhat accurate but it is not entertaining and seems out of context with the rest of the writing. The most glaring and detracting distractions are the many inconsistencies that occur over and over. Compare the descriptions of Jack on page 554 and then on page 808. The 6 typos I've found so far while not the author's fault just add to the general sloppiness of ""Pillars of the Earth""."
3,Not an epic..,"After reading the reviews here, I couldn't wait to read this book. I don't know what I expected, but I have read better historic fiction. Yes, there were a lot of twists to the story, but I was never surprised and sometimes I felt there were twists just to have a twist in the story. The violent acts in the book were depicted in great detail and other sections were so sparse in detail, it was difficult to know what was happening. A much too long book for the story, I found myself skimming pages just to get through it.I should have known if Oprah thought this was a great book, it probably wasn't."
4,What a great surprise!!,I didn't know if I would like this book because it wasn't my normal style of writing. What a surprise!
2,Beneath Follet's capabilities,"This was a huge disappointment to me. Given that Follet can write a decent book and my interest in the subject matter, it was very much a let down to slog my way through this soap opera of 20th Century characters stuck in mideviel times. Given that I had taken this 700 page tome to Costa Rica and wanted it to sustain the bulk of my beach reading I had little alternative but to read it, although every 100 pages I would flog it across the sand. Maybe if I had hit the surf it would have been ruined such that I would have avoided wasting further time on it. For those that want real adventure of this time period I would recommend you read The Archer's Tale (and follow on books) from Bernard Cornwell. Most of all I wish Follet would have read The Archer's Tale and seen what his book should look like. I won't go near Follet's own sequel."
1,Extremely Poor Storytelling,"I tried to keep going, I really did, but I only made it 8% of the way through this book. I kept reading and hoping that it would get better, but alas it did not.The writing is extremely simplistic. ""He did this. Then he felt that. Then he said that."" It completely abandons the ""show don't tell"" rule of all writing. I was completely uninterested in the characters and the plot. I would not suggest this book to anyone."
4,The Pillars of the Earth,It was a very detailed book and very interesting. I like Ken Follett style of writing. It takes awhile but is worth it.
2,The pillars of the earth,I found the book to be overlong and convoluted. I lost interest in it I am sure many others found the book and tv miniseries to be fascinating. This is just one person's opinion
5,Good R,Anybody interested in novels set in merry olde England during medieval times will love this book. This book is a great read
3,Enjoyable but too drawn-out,"This was a good book that provided a great vision into medieval life; however, I felt that much of the detail was included to extend the story. It very well could've ended sooner and without so much back-and-forth treachery."
3,too much,"pretty good read- I would say too indulgent in violence. Rape from POV of rapist is a tactless. Good read otherwise, not amazing."
2,"Weak, overrated, and pretentious","Ok, I was told that this book was great way back before Oprah recommend it. I picked it up for a long plane ride and while it held my interest, it ultimately was a disappointing book.The Author somehow mixed up the idea that a lengthy, convoluted plot meant 'epic'. What you get in this novel is relatively flat with characters each given a few identifying traits.I have a feeling the Author looked through the book he wrote and realized it was quite boring, then did his darndest to throw in some violence and sex to add some 'realism'. While I have no problem with adult content, it seemed kind of forced in the R rated, ""we want to show some nudity for realism but lets be careful not to show *too* much"" kind of way.Same with the violence. A few of the scenes were just weak shock attempts.Overall, this seems like the type of novel written by someone who has a lot more faith in themselves then they should have."
1,Horrible!,"I'm no prude, but this book is nothing but soft porn! I expected more from this ""classic"" that people have been talking about for 2 decades. While I have enjoyed a few romance novels in my time, I did not care for it in this format. I am well aware that the lifestyle was brutal in the Middle Ages and that murder and rape were rampant. However, the rape scenes are written to be erotic and, in one scene, a young virginal victim is gang raped and enjoys it. It is apparent that the author finds sex by force to be a turn on, because it happens in great detail many times over."
3,Pillars of the Earth,"I am enjoying this book tremedously. Good woven tale involving many different people and families. I also like the setting of the story, especially the time line. Lots of deceit and misery to keep you captured and interested in what's next. Interesting tale!"
2,Too violent,"Too violent for my sensitivities, which is to be spiritually focused. Couldn't get past the violence, so quit reading the book. In general I don't like Oprah's Book Club choices."
5,The Straight Skinny,Extraordinarily wonderful. True epic read. Just when you think you cannot be suprised further...wham!Truly in the top five books on my list of all time.If I were to ever write a book this would be it.
4,Author is a Master Builder,"Mesmerizing tale of historical significance a look at early history of England,Frannce, monistary life and political intrigue. An inside look at many interwoven relationships."
5,Pillars of the Earth Review,"The Pillars of the Earth (Deluxe Edition) (Oprah's Book Club)Ken Follett has outdone himself in this new book, quite different from his earlier work, and clearly his passion. This work opens up the daily lives of the people, the drama and danger of the times with an understanding not only of the building process, but the rationale for the great cathedrals in the advancement of western social systems. The characters are griping and real as they procede through their lives and trials. A work that should be read by all."
5,The Pillars of the Earth,"This was a gift for my sister, so this is her review. She said it was so good that she could hardly put it down...she finished it in a few days."
3,Pillars,"I read this book because so many reviewers had touted it as the best book they ever read and because it was a genre that I like. I was a little disappointed. The story was alright, but there are worhtier ones within this genre. It wasn't as entertaining as any of Penman's novels, nor was it anything unique like the novel Sarum. It was simply written, easy to read, and went fast despite being close to one thousand pages long, but towards the end I just wanted it to be over so I could move on. There is some bad language in this book as well as some overly described violence and sexuality. I'm usually not to bothered by these things, but some of the violence had me feeling nauseous and I actually skipped the three pages Follet devoted to describing a bear-baiting. Nothing really remarkable about this book, a good story, but average."
3,"A bit clunky, but a good long Romp full of Anachronisms","Sure it was a bit fluffy but I was up for a long romp of fantasy. I considered it loosely historical fiction. I did cringe at the vast number of anachronisms but it made it easier for the average person, I suspect, to relate to the novel. I also found the sexual stuff to have far too much detail, let us have our imaginations if the descriptions are to be so clumsy and crass."
1,Disappointed,"I asked for this book for Christmas 2007 because I wanted to read it so bad. It was painful to try to finish it. I have not read this author before, but have heard very good things about him. Needless to say I will probably not consider him a favorite. I wanted so much to like this book but I was very, very disappointed."
2,not thrilled,"While I often love Oprah's picks, this one just isn't doing it for me. Way too much gratuitous sex (and I am not one to mind a good sex scene in a book), I feel written down to as a reader, as if everything need not only be told but then explained as well. Overall, skip it unless you tend to like adequately written (at best) historical novels that smack of romance novels."
2,Follett was going to write 1000 pages no matter what.,"Tedious. Crisis...Resolution. Crisis...Resolution. Over and over and over and over again and again. I am 2/3 through this novel and I am debating whether to just put it down and walk away. I find that the critical reviews here are more in line with my own. I realize that the kiss of death (literally and figuratively) for the main characters is good fortune. It never lasts. Good fortune means bad things are on the way. The villains rape, kill, pillage, and burn. Then they get a slap in the wrist and do it again. Over and over and over and over again and again. Did I already write that?The most accurate review that I have read here so far was titled...""400 Pages too long!""Why 2 stars? The first half was good."
1,poorly written and a real bore,"I can't believe all the positive reviews of this book. The characters are completely unbelievable and sound like 20th century people with 20th century sensibilities who have inexplicably been plunked down in the 12th century. What a way to take a fascinating time in history and make it completely boring. In the end, I plowed through this book just to see how he was going to tie up all the loose ends. As it turned out, the ones that were tied up were done so in a totally predictable manner and the rest were just left hanging. I don't know how stuff like this gets published."
1,Painful,"I had held off on this book for a while simply because of the length. Now that I am, according to my Kindle, 54% in...I wonder why I have kept reading this far! Words, words, words with nothing being said. I also don't understand the amazing reviews. While parts of the book are slightly interesting I can't figure out why half-way through nothing has really happened. It make take 20 years to build a cathedral, but I can't believe it still takes that long to write about it. I think I finally decided to give up just now. Moving on..."
5,a great historical fresco,"I recently read ""The pillars of the earth"" by Ken Follett. It is a book which combines both a historical fresco and an imaginary novel. On one hand, the author shows the different steps in building cathedrals, from design to construction. He attemps to explain the complexity of the structure of a cathedral and he shows us the variety of architectural styles in England, France and Spain. He mingles a historical view with fiction using created, ad-hoc characters. The reader can see the historical aspect of the story through the eyes of the main characters who evolve within a realistic framework."
5,FOLLET'S MASTERPIECE,"""Pillars of the Earth"" is undoubtedly Ken Follet's masterpiece. Utilizing 12th century medieval England as a backdrop, Follet weaves an engrossing tale heavy-laden with passionate romance, suspenseful intrigue, and unexpected plot twists"
5,"Quite simply, my favorite book, period.","This book has been impossible to put down, on several occasions. I have read it about once a year since it came out, and have found it as hard to put down the third and forth times as the first"
2,"Boring, pretentious writing","One of the worst books I've ever read. Pretentious, boring writing with no drama or tension. The storyline was mediocre, the characters unlikeable. Yet another example of a heavily advertised and marketed book with no substance from an author who might be talented but whose talent hides behind flowery, colourful language.This is a bestseller? Watching paint dry is more interesting."
1,"Borrow, don't buy this book. WARNING Please read","Please do yourself a favor and borrow this book from the library. Please don't invest any money on this until you read the first 100 pages or so (if you get that far). You may save yourself some money when you decide to put it aside.I am a normal reader who enjoys most of what I start. ""Pillars"" was the most amazingly bad novel I have ever started. Please remember I am NOT a tough critic. This book is written for a 6th grade reading level. SO basic and uninspired writing. Plus the story is so elementary and contrived.Truly a bad book from a language and story perspective. What's left?Remember, borrow this, don't buy it!"
1,I wanted to like it,"I had many people recommend this book to me and normally I love historical fiction, but I read about 250 pages of this and gave up(I hardly ever do that). This book is SO boring and has no heart. I didn't care about any of the characters and didn't care what happened to them- except the baby that is left on the side of the road to die. If you are looking for good historical fiction try something else- The Outlander, Gone with the Wind, The Heretic Queen- anything but this."
3,Far fetched but fun,A great read for a long plane journey and back but a little bit too far fetched and unrealistic. I would prefer to read something with a few less convenient coincidences to be more believable. Great fun though.
3,not what I expect it,"I was counting the minuets and the pages to finish this bookbut it is not my first disappointment in choosing a book from (Opera's book club selection),dont get me wrong I really love her and everything related to her except the book selections,I was waiting for the thrill and the moments were I would not be able to put the book down from my hands;but still i couldn't find them.didn't like it at all. maybe I will enjoy the movie not sure about it.eventually, everyone of us have his or her unique taste, what I enjoy may not necessary you would enjoy.just an advise:dont waste your time reading it just pick another historical book and enjoy it instead.Manal"
3,Historical saga or soap opera?,"The book kept my interest for 1000 pages which is hard to do. It is well written, characters are interesting, the historical setting was new to me and enjoyable. My main gripe is that the William character got away with too many rapes and I got sick of hearing about them. I wanted him to die a painful slow death at the hand of one of his victims and was disappointed when it didn't happen. The book is not a masterpiece, does not break any new ground, but it's a good read, I may read the second one on vacation some day."
2,So very disappointed.....,"I had so many people tell me how wonderful this book is and how I HAD to read it. I am so very disappointed. While I won't deny that Follet's characters became intriguing to me, actually reading this book was SO boring and repetitive. Besides the fact that the same descriptions of people and places are repeated over and over again, honestly how many misfortunes can one character withstand? Even the misfortunes themselves start to run together and become repetitive - horrible men do horrible thing to good people, good people find a way to overcome and prosper, same evil men do horrible thing, good people find a way through, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat....and FINALLY after 973 extremely long, boring pages you reach a less than satisfying conclusion."
1,"Oh Please, Why Do People Like This??","This is just about the worst book I have ever read . It is all predictably plot-driven with no character development. The men are ignoramous oafs who have no clue as to what is or why things are going on around them. The women can only be strong or intelligent if they are: 1) freaks who live in the woods; 2) hideous; or 3) raped and brutalized. The sexuality and the violence described is completely disturbing. Not to mention that I am not persuaded that the author has portrayed 12th century society. The speech and attitudes seem like something out of the 1970s, not King Stephen's age. The suspense was cliched and the writing just went on and on. Kill off the bad guys already, I thought, and be done with it. If you want good suspense, read Forsyth. If you want Middle Ages, read the Doomsday Book by Connie Willis."
3,Not great. Amazon purchase.,This is Ken Follet's worst writing. It was a page-turner and I read very miserably written word.A beach book.
3,Interesting but ultimately unsatisfying,An interesting story adequately told - somewhat formulaic writing style. Credible if simplistic characters (good vs evil in sharp relief; few shades of grey). The climax occurred at about the 85% mark and petered out after that which left me kinda flat. Book is a useful companion to the TV series; though both suffered mightily following so closely after Games of Thrones!Pillars of Fire (The Genesis Series)
4,Have to be interested in history,"What keeps you going through this book are the historical details, the remarks about classic architecture. If that sound like you, then this is your book because all the rest--the characters etc.--are solid and professional. But, if you're not a history addict, this might run a bit long."
5,Simply Brilliant,"Follett is a master who has created a work that, despite being set hundreds of years in the past, reflects the very sort of political shenanigans and manipulations that are going on today. Pillars of the Earth is rich in sensory detail, easily transporting the reader to the Middle Ages. The book is structured very well, telling the tales of the various characters in parts before knitting them seamlessly together to give us the whole.Jack Builder is one of the most original and fascinating characters I've ever read, followed by his mother, Ellen. I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth and I'm looking forward to reading World Without End."
5,epic!,This book hooked me from the first page. Great characters and plot. Some gruesome passages. It's almost 1000 pages but I couldn't put it down and I read it in a week.
5,Thrilling!!!,I got this book from my world history teacher for extra credit and when I got started to read I couldn't stop reading it! I would spend 5 or more hours straight reading this book. I would recommend to everyone if they asked me about! I loved it!!!
1,Worst book I've read in a long time,"I originally read The Pillars of the Earth when it was published in 1989. I enjoyed it at the time. I was 14.More recently I had heard about the sequel and decided it was time to re-read the original beforehand. Wow. I'm having the hardest time forcing myself to get through it -- like some of the other reviewers mentioned I'm scanning the chapters for plot points to avoid the misery of wading through the writing. It's pulpy, the characters are one-dimensional, the prose is ponderous, and *everything* is laid out for the reader. The plot is interesting, but not novel. It's incredibly overrated, and I recommend you skip this one."
1,Wish I'd known,"I wish I'd known about the very graphic and violent sex scenes, not to mention the anachronistic language in this book. I love historical fiction and was not expecting ""f-bombs"" among other descriptive vulgarities. It was a frustrating read because the characters are great and the story compelling with a unique framework (cathedral building), yet every instance of swearing immediately pulled me out of the time and reminded me that this is just a book. A good editor, it seems, would have recommended far less gratuitous sex, gore and vulgarity. Too bad Mr. Follett lacked such editorial guidance! I can't recommend the book."
1,Huge waste of time,"This book is redundant beyond belief. Why did the author feel compelled to tell us over and over again what we just read. Also, I found three major type errors. Didn't anyone edit this thing? The four page + rape scene was pointless, graphic and added nothing to the story or character. I struggled to even finish the book. I skipped the beginning of each chapter because of the repetition. The characters were hollow and unbelievable, especially the ""villan""."
1,Reads like a soap opera,Terrible book. The story line consists of lurching from one crisis to another. The sex scenes are way too graphic & over the top. I plowed on to the end but would never read another one of Follett's books.
2,A Classic BORE,"Extremely long, over-wrought tale of good vs. evil with the see-saw tipping back and forth 6 million times. I skimmed a lot."
3,An alternative Medieval choice,"I enjoyed The Pillars of the Earth from a story standpoint, but if you like medieval historical novels that are not only gripping in their plot but well written, try Edith Pargeter's The Heaven Tree Trilogy. Follett's prose is pretty pedestrian with very little variety in sentence structure (the subject, verb, object pattern over and over again becomes a drum beat). Pargeter (also known as Ellis Peters - the author of the Brother Cadfael series) is an exquisite writer with a thorough knowledge of her history settings. The Brother Cadfael books cover the same years as the Pillars of the Earth (Empress Maud vs. King Stephen). The Heaven Tree Trilogy is 13th century - but involves a stone mason, cathedral building, etc. I kept comparing The Pillars of the Earth to Pargeter's book and it fell short even though I enjoyed being carried along in the interesting story. Look up The Heaven Tree Trilogy and give it a try!"
4,Intense historical suspense,"Not a book about architecture! Follet takes you back to the early middle ages and introduces you to an unexpected cast of characters: the haughty princess, the forest witch, the starving mason, the son of the foreigner, an evil earl and an entrepreneurial prior. All come together to weave a story that sways fortune between good and evil. Entertaining, great action, a bit over-the-top at the end, but highly recommended."
5,"Very nice book, even translated into Spanish","I read it in Spanish a year ago, it took me a year (some pages every night before I went to sleep) and I still remember a lot from its characters. I will read it again someday."
5,This one has it all!,"I've never read any of Ken Follet's suspense/spy novels, but he certainly does a first-rate job with historical fiction. Pillars of the Earth is a great, great book - truly a must-read for anyone with an interest in the Middle Ages, or in cathedrals, or simply anyone who loves a well-told epic. Follet introduces his novel with a mystery, the effects of which intertwine the lives of numerous generations of vastly different characters. He weaves in religion, politics, love, lust, betrayal, and murder all together in a story about the building of a cathedral. One of the best books I've ever read, Pillars of the Earth deserves a place on the shelf of classics of historical fiction."
5,One of my all-time favorite books!,"I love big historic novels, and as far as they go, this book has everything: politics, battle, betrayal, romance, and a lot of great Gothic architecture. I first read this book several years ago in it's physical version, on my mom's recommendation. I was so enthralled that I completed it in just a few days. When I got my Kindle Fire I knew that this was one of the books that I just HAD to download. It's been one of my absolute favorites for a long time, and I highly recommend it...it is truly epic!"
2,Somewhere between Utter Dreck & the Best HIstorical Fiction,"The writer describes numerous scenes of rape and other torture which such relish that the book became extremely off-putting to me. Too bad, because other than the repetitive overuse of certain literary devices, scatterrings of melodrama, and too many tedious technical explanations of edifice construction that belong in an appendix with illustrations; this book had the potential to be a brilliant epic."
2,Grossly Overrated,"I got sucked into reading this book for a book club. The only honest part of this book was the Preface. The author boldly states that when this was first published, he was surprised at its popularity. He wanted to write a book about his passion for cathedrals. That was the book's only merit. The characters are flat; the plot belongs in a soap opera. Not only did I suffer through this book, but I hopped on board for World Without End...which was doubly awful. But that's another review."
5,The best book i've ever read,"THe whole book, that took me forever and a half to read cause im such a distracted and slow reader kept be busy for two weeks. the book is most captivating, i loved it. and i brought such hatred for william, one of the characters. I wish they had a movie of the book."
5,The Pillars of the Earth,"This was the 1st Follett novel I've read. Since then I have read ""A Dangerous Fortune"" and if anything it is even better. Pillars sweeps you back to a different time and circumstance BUT has a lot of relevant issues facing everyone today. Religion, greed, ambition, crime and justice not served, etc."
1,Bad writing skills bogs this book down,Story is somewhat entertaining but the writing skills of this authors are bad and it definitely prevented me from enjoying it.
5,Ken Follett Rocks!!,"Could there ever be a better novel than PILLARS OF THE EARTH? The characters are SO real, and the story of the families is SO good, you will remember it long after you are finished with it!! It is a big book, and the first thing you do is sigh, and think ""Oh, this one will take me forever to read!"" AHA! You will get to the last pages, and NOT want it to end. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and plan to reread it again in a couple of years!"
4,Pillars of the Earth,"The involving story of the building of a fictional cathedral in a fictional English town in the 12th century. The author does a fine job of infusing the politics of the era into the tale and making clear the machinations of history as they unfold, and the influence of individuals in the results. Realistically told, these characters ring true throughout their extended lives.If you liked this book you would probably also enjoy ""Sarum"" by Edward Rutherfurd, a tale of the founding of the city of Salisbury and the building of that city's actual cathedral."
1,What a soap opera!,"I don't understand why this book got rave reviews. The plot belongs on daytime television. The characters lack dimension. The writing is unconvincing. If you like well-crafted historical fiction, this book is not for you."
2,"""Saga"" is certainly an apt word to describe this book.","This book was recommended to me by a friend who had read and loved it, however she had read a Scandinavian translation. Perhaps the translation smoothed many of the rough edges? I found it to be the storyline to be repetitive, the violence and sex scenes to be far too drawn out and over emphasised and many characters to be emotionally underdeveloped. I am giving the book 2 stars as yes, it did keep me reading until the end, but only in the unfulfilled hope that it would improve."
3,Good but..,"When I first pick up this book I was struck by the beauty of it in general, the cover, the headings, the illustrations. It never dawned on my that I'd have to get through 1000 pages. The characters and setting were well drawn but it didn't take long to figure out that Tom the Builder was going to run into every single character in this book as he walked down the road with his family. Thank God he didn't die until page 600 or so. They were lost without him. At about page 800 I couldn't take it any longer. I skimmed through the rest only to make sure that William really died and that Alicia and Jack could get married once and for all. In other words, it dragged on too long.Linda C. WrightAuthorOne Clown Short"
5,One of the Greatest Historical Novels of all Time!,"""One of the greatest historical novels of all time. Make sure you have an entire weekend with nothing else to do but read when you start this book."""
5,Hated to see it end!,Book was FANTASTIC!!! I couldn't put it down (my husband complained.. you in that book again!) Well written.. A must read! Hope Ken Foliett writes a sequel to this one.
1,One of the Worst,"Put bluntly, if this book is read and admired by so many, then there is hope for every historical fiction writer, even those in the Third Grade. I've always found Ken Follett on the whole to be one of the most over rated writers of our time, incredibly inept at plotting, expert at dulling every opportunity for suspense, sprawling time beyond his capability (Probably with one history book at his side as a guide), terribly insensitive to the human experience, exceedingly dull and disjointed story lines, and always leaving me with the questions---That's was all the hype was about? Are you kidding?"
1,Couldn't finish it!,"I was so excited to read this book. I love historical fiction. I love architecture. Someone called it a thriller and I love a thriller so what acould be better?! Co-workers kept telling me how much they loved it so I was very anxious to delve in. But it just didn't ever capture my interest or attention. Just as I would become interested in a character or characters, the book would switch locations and move on to something or someone else. This happened over and over. I would read and read and hope to get involved, but I just couldn't. I finally decided to stop waisting my time, it just wasn't for me. I truly wish I understood the popularity of this book."
5,Possibly one of the best (fiction) books I've ever read,"I cannot say enough good things about this book. The characters are superbly developed, and the plot is fascinating and well thought out. Follett's attention to detail in this book is outstanding. The story takes so many twists and turns, taking the reader from elation to sorrow to wanting revenge on the antagonists with well written prose. I read this in about 3 days over the course of a weekend. I just could not put it down!"
1,Dumbing down the literate among us,"Let me keep this short. Read the review by Ash of Phoenix as it says what I would otherwise want to share with prospective readers about this moronic tome.The only thing more boring than the 1000 pages of this dreary, predictable, and tiresomely inaccurate ""historical"" novel is the pompous self-congratulatory preface by Follett.In it he describes the creative whim that prompted him to deviate from his usual pulp fiction, and he thanks the readers who've allowed this book to gather its cult following. Cult following? Well, okay. I suppose legions of people with the cult(ivated) tastes of a sixth grader . . .I looked at Amazon because I was curious to see what ""people who bought this book also bought"" and would not have surprised to see comic books and Cosmo magazine on the list."
4,Surprisely liked the book but ending was boring,"I didn't think I would like this book because I usually don't read historical fiction but surprisingly, I did. The characters were very well thought of and came to life as you read. You will find yourself hoping the best for the heriones and wishing bad things will happen to the bad guys. The story will pull you in and have you thinking about the characters even when you are not reading the book. However, the ending was a not the great ending I thought it would be. After reading a book of this length and this well thought of, you would think the ending would be.....more."
2,wordy,"1. Historically an a+ as to my opinion, being no medieval scholar.2. Plot, predictable and complex at the same time. You know so and so is going to get it, you just don't know how or when, but the alternatives suggest themselves.3.WORDY my GOD it is reminiscent of Dickens, who according to someone I know wrote in installments and so got ""paid by the word"". It was a good book, but I scanned whole paragraphs at a time to avoid the tedium of reading them and find out what the flip happened. To the books credit, again, I DID want to find out, but, it was hard going. It would have been a great book if it were 2/3rds shorter.M"
1,Nothing good to say about it except it was long,"At last I completed the 32 discs of Pillars of the Earth last night. What a relief! That was one really badly written book. No character development. Hackneyed writing. Repetitive descriptions. Plot plods along with occasional forays into sex and descriptive violence. It was nice of Follet to describe a bit about cathedral building which I think was the pretense for creating this dull lump of verbiage. Never knew that 13th century social values were so similar to those of the 20th century, but I guess the non-fiction I have read or courses I have listened to did not have their ear to the reality of the early middle ages as Follet did. Now I can move on to a well-written novel -- what a pleasure! [As a contrast to Follet's wooden style I have been reading William Trevor's Lucy Gault. What a different approach to storytelling!]"
5,Pillars of the Earth,Rec'd the book quickly and on time. Book was in the condition as decribed. Would purchase from this vendor again.
3,"Extremely well-constructed, deftly plotted, marred by stereotypes","Well-architected, very well plotted, superbly paced epic novel does a spectacular job illuminating its plot and characters. The thrust of the action and the characters' relationships is always clear and compelling. Historical information was fascinating and educational.Book marred by the stereotyped characters, with the villains and heroes physical form mirroring their supposed moral status, and lack of nuance. Description of the William's mother, for example, was purposely cliched and simplistic."
5,Backwards compatible,"Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City can be played on my 250 gigabyte Xbox 360 Slim but Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas can't yet my friend's version works just fine on it so I suspect it has something to do with the removal of ""hot coffee""."
5,A W E S O M E,"i got this $30 brand new now at the time a new copy of san andreas was $50!! so i got san andreas $20 cheaper plus gta3 and vc for free basically if you have the games on ps2 already and you want to see the enhanced graphics,custom soundtracks(and nice controls) on the x-box then you should get this i've played san andreas so much it's scratched up and i can't play it now AAHH"
5,A Thoughtful Adventure,"This film transports us to the beautiful land of NZ, where the filmmaker embarks on a journey of curiosity, discovery, and determination. As a viewer, we're lucky enough that he takes us along with him. The scenes are gorgeously shot, yet the movie is kept very real -- I love some of the personal insights that the filmmaker interjects throughout the journey about his own life as he reflects while hiking hundreds of miles. The people he meets along the way couldn't be more colorful, and they open up to the camera in a way that is both endearing and highly entertaining. If you like adventure, the outdoors, beautiful scenery, and history, all paired with a good soundtrack and thoughtful dialog, this movie is for you!"
3,Typical aftermarket vs. OEM,The cable had to be trimmed down where it connects to the throttle control. Otherwise the idle was extremely too high. Sometimes it's better to just stick to OEM parts for replacement.
5,outstanding,this small system looks as good as it sounds very happy and really like the remote great value for the money.
5,Wonderful sophmore effort.....,"This CD is a blast. Good driving/jamming music. Play it over and over, it's infectious!"
5,Just gorgeous!,"I was a little leary about buying a watch without being able to see it and try it on. But the sale price was so good, I couldn't resist.The watch is absolutely beautiful. I am extremely pleased with it."
2,Be careful,"Attractive watch, feels good. The link started snapping off during the first few days of wearing it. got it fixed, then it broke from another part of the strap again.Too fragile, too much hassle. Ended up paying and wasting time for getting it all done."
5,Excellent watch for the price,I just bought this watch as a wedding gift for my cousin. she absolutely loved it. The stones are really shinny and the shape of the dial looks great. I would highly recommend this watch.
2,Broken wrist band,"The first time I wore the watch the wrist band broke. Once I get it fixed, I will be worried that next time it breaks, I will not find the watch."
3,"Great concept, no support","This is a superbly planned program. It walks the user through a simple but detailed interview leading to a conclusion about the adequacy of one's plans to their idea of retirement. My big complaint, however, is that Intuit has not supported the program at all. They posted a minor touchup on their website two years ago, then abandoned further revisions. The most current edition fails to acknowledge the 1998 tax reforms, such as capital gains tax reduction, and exemption of capital gains on sale of a home."
2,A good product goes downhill,"I've used the Financial Planner for a number of years and found it helpful ... until recently. The additions of Roth IRAs a few years ago and other more recent tax changes required the planner to be updated. It is no longer accurate. I tried installing one of the patches, but it wouldn't install. So I'm left with my favorite financial planner being almost useless. It still helps me consider all the options for planning my retirement, but it could have remained GREAT. Intuit is not supporting this product adequately, so now I'm in the market for something better. Too bad, it really was great a few years ago. Too bad for Intuit and their customers."
3,It grows on you.,"OK, let's face it. This isn't the greatest swing cd in the world. But it ain't bad. And it gets better every time you listen to it. There are a few clinkers here and there, but hey, thanks what the ""skip track"" button is for."
5,Of the wall greatness!!!,Gurren Lagann is one of my favcorite animes of all time. It's basically a parody of Gundam or similar mech based anime with that Gainax off the wall twist.
4,Pretty good movie,"I recently purchased this movie and viewed it in two days. I think kids will enjoy this movie. Adults shouldn't have any problems either. I'm a fan of the animator and I'm familiar with his work from urbanentertainment dot com. If you enjoy super hero cartoons, this should be enjoyable. One aspect that I like about this movie is that it was created using Macromedia Flash (Now Adobe Flash). It think it's great that anyone can create his or her own cartoon using Adobe Flash and distribute it to DVD. I think it's also a nice aspect that Sanaa Lathan, Michael Clark Duncan and Blair Underwood got to do the voices in the cartoon."
5,"Gilmour 10-58100 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch-by-100-Foot, Green",The best Hose on the market. Well worth the price and proberly will never have to buy another Hose again. You get what you pay for. Highly recommend to all.
4,Gilmour Flexogen,"One of the best hoses I have used.Warm weather service has been good,waiting to see how it performs in near freezing temps."
4,Flexogen Hose,I found that this hose was just how amazon described it. The hose is a little stiff but doesn't kink as much as a normal hose. I also own one of the neverkink brands and this is a little stiffer than those hoses for comparison. Knowing that I have a lifetime warranty that company will actually follow through with is a great piece of mind for me!
5,Gilmore Hose,"Purchased this hose for length and quality. Very pleased with it and non kinking. Next on my list is a 100' 3/4"" Gilmore hose of the same type. Water runs off pump and the larger diameter gives me more flow. Warrantee is great also!"
5,WHERE MY HOSE AT?,"Excellent hose. These are the best hose I ever used. These are the top of the line hose. Stay away from cheap hose, dirty hose, and crazy hose. You will love these hose. These are some fine hose. Bright green is pretty fly on hose. These are well built hose. Some people like kinky hose. I personally do not. These hose are not kinky. Hose are very flexible. These hose are not skinny. These hose are fat, but not too heavy. These are tough hose, but I have no problem with these hose. You can never have enough hose."
1,Not a Quality Product,"I purchased two 5/8"" 100 ft. hoses and was initially pleased. However, one of them sprung two leaks within the first 2 weeks of use. These were manufacturing defects; tiny holes that ran all the way through the ""8 layers"" of material. I patched them and moved on. Over the very mild winter here in VA, both of the hoses suffered surface cracks (not through to the inside; outer case only) and sprung new leaks. They were stored outside on a reel. I blew air through them before putting them up so the likelyhood of freezing water in the line is remote. Interestingly, the other hoses on the reel (Swan) do not leak and show no signs of stress. I have had the Swan hoses for 10 or more years.Gilmour 10-58100 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch-by-100-Foot, Green"
1,So Disappointed!,"After reading several good reviews about this hose, I decided to order one. First concern was that it arrived in a box without an invoice....just a hose in a box. The first time we used the hose, it kinked and that's one of the reason we ordered it. It wasn't supposed to kink. Lastly, after using it about 4 times, it sprung a leak as the result of a small hole/tear in the hose. Unbelievable!"
2,Leaks from end connector,Bought this from a local hardware store. Leaks from the end connector. Tried to exchange it but all they had on hand was the next model down. That one worked but after four years it cracked wear it bends to fit my Ames hose reel. Next time I'm trying a different brand.
2,This hose is garbage.,"Saw this hose mentioned in Real Simple magazine and thought it must be great after such a positive review. Let me tell you -- it is not worth the expense. The male fitting leaks all around. It's also clunky and does not recoil well. Hoses from Target are much more reliable, cheaper and even look nicer."
1,HOLEY HOSE,"I really wanted to love this hose to replace a too heavy, too kinky hose. Even though some reviewers indicated problems, I decided to go ahead and order from Amazon anyway. It arrived quickly and well packaged. After unwinding and unscrewing the old hose, I attached this hose and wound it on the hose reel, attached the sprayer and turned it on to have water spray from two holes in the body of the hose and only a trickle come out of the hose end. How disappointing. Well now I was wet and muddy and I had to unwind the hose, clean it off and wind it up to fit back in the box for return shipment. Well I am an elderly woman and found this whole procedure difficult and messy. I have to say that the return was very easy and I got my refund with no problem. I'm still using the too heavy, too kinky old hose that at least doesn't leak."
3,Not for Food Gardens,"This is a sturdy hose, but not for gardens. Gilmour hoses contain lead. My husband purchased one of these. I read the label (writing is on the back of the one we got) and it carries a warning about lead."
3,The hose does kink,"I am a long time customer of Flexogen. However, they have changed something in their hose production, maybe less layers, maybe a softer plastic compound, but the hose that is not suppossed to kink does. I still love our hose and it doesn't kink as bad as less expensive ones, but it does kink. Wish it was the same as the ones I purchased ten years ago."
3,"No kinking yet, but...",I bought two of these hoses a couple of months ago. I store them outside on a covered hose reel during the watering season and use them about 3 times per week. They haven't kinked or cracked yet. But they started to flatten into an oval shape. I probably wouldn't have purchased these if I had seen them in person first. They just don't look like high quality hoses. But only time will tell how good they really are.
2,By no means is it kink free,"I purchased (4) 50' sections of this hose last year based on it's ratings. My experience with it is that it is by no means kink free. Although better than the ""contractor grade"" rubber hoses previously purchased, kinking is a serious issue with this alleged kink-free product. Meanwhile, Craftsman hoses purchased over 35 years ago as are Swan hoses purchased at BJ's about 15 years ago are far superior and still in use.Without water pressure in the hose it will kink at every loop. With water pressure it fares better, but it doesn't match my 35 year old Craftsman hose."
1,"Expensive, Poor Quality",I bought a 50 foot flexogen hose. It is easily the most expensive hose I ever bought. Also it is the worst hose I ever bought. Water comes out everywhere except where I need it.
1,not the best,"If you want a good hose, made in the usa, and very tough, get this one: Made in Oregon (waterrightinc dot com) best hose I have ever used. Small diameter but it still seems to flow very well."
1,CAUSES CANCER??? DON'T BUY THIS HOSE!,"I bought this hose, and in the back (hidden from you when you buy it) is a stern warning that the product contains ""One or more chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm"". You're supposed to wash your hands after you use it! Wash my hands after using a garden hose? Give me a break!COME ON! This is supposed to be a GARDEN hose! Don't buy this toxic piece of junk."
2,"Good quality, but does not reach the pit!!!","I needed a new hose for the pit I dug in the basement. Of course the first place I went was Amazon. I also needed lotion, and basket, a length of rope and other various leather tools. The hose was incapable of reaching the pit!!! No matter how hard I pulled, it wouldn't reach. Eventually, I pulled too hard and the plumbing ruptured filling the pit and drowning it's inhabitant. Oh well, you have to break a few eggs to make an omlet."
2,Hose kinks,I bought these hoses in hopes of less kink issues than I had in other hoses. Unfortunately this hose kinks easily as well.
2,Developed leaks quickly,"This is one where I should have listened to the other reviewers. I liked the idea of a premium hose made in the USA. Unfortunately, after sitting out less than a month it started developing bubbles with pinhole leaks. Due to the nature of the material, you can not just tape them up as with a rubber hose. The black rubber Craftsman this replaced lasted me a good 10 years. I should have sent this one back."
2,6 months and kinking,"Well,it was nice while it lasted, but this turned out to be a pretty cheap hose also. As soon as the weather here in South Florida started the warm days/cool nights, this Gilmour started getting kinks all over. I am not sure there really is a hose that won't kink; this one sure does."
2,Seemed perfect... for a while,"I bought this hose from Amazon on a clearance sale forsomething like $10. Really cheap!I received it and I was very impressed... sturdy, thick, and by far the heaviest hose I've ever seen.It didn't tangle easily and I loved it.Then problems occured.1) It was so heavy that it tore the hose hanger from my house in the back yard.2) it started to leak at the connections on *both* ends.I cut the hose shorter with a knife and attached my own hose ends from the hardware store and it works great now, but it should have lasted years before it leaked."
5,"So far, so good","I was in search of a hose that would not kink. I have tried many with no success, only a great amount of frustration. Watering the garden became one of the worst chores you could imagine. Every few minutes was spent unkinking the hose. After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase this hose. Although it was a bit on the pricey side, I thought that if it truly was kink-free then it would be priceless. I can report that although I have only had the hose several weeks, the few times I have used it have been perfect. NO KINKS! If this keeps up through the heavy watering times in summer, I would say that this hose is worth every penny."
3,Not original recordings,"Like the title of the album says, this one contains 22 of Don Gibson's greatest hits. The recordings are finely produced and the collection is fairly thorough. If you're a Don Gibson fan and just want to listen to him sing his hits (and the performance is very well done), this album is well worth you money; I often have it in my rotation for ""background"" music while doing other things. BUT, these are recent recordings....NOT ORIGINAL. If you're like me and prefer the original sound of the 1960's Don Gibson (and folks, Don is hard to beat), go elsewhere. Despite my criticism, Don's voice has held up well, and the use of a rather biting electric guitar for the leads is not all bad."
2,Not good,It is almost as if publisher threw this book together. It does not clearly explain everything as it should. Some problems explained how to work a problem..but it turned out to be completely wrong.
3,a good book and no more.,"I bought this book to increase my knowledge with CosmosWorks. There is not many books talking about the 2005 version. This one is not bad but could be much better as well.The explanations are quite easy to understand but some résumé are missing. For a book talking about CosmosWorks ( one of the best visual FEA software ) it should be normal to have the illustration in color ! Everything in black and white is a pity, especially for this price. I m waiting as well a book dealing with non linear ( this one definitely not ), it should be normal considering that most of the user are making simulation for plastics part.Target : Beginner to user with some know how.Rate : between 3 and 4 Stars"
1,NOT VALLEY FORGE,"This is not a Valley Forge flag. It is a cheap, probably polyester, flag. Valley Forge stamps all their flags and attaches a Perma Nyl tag. Amazon refunded my money when the seller made no response."
5,California State flag,Top quality pole flag. Material and craftsmanship were exceptional. The colors and print were within expectations. I would recommend this flag to others seeking a top quality flag.
4,good,"It's edited a bit poorly. There are times when it quickly fades to black when you'd like to have seen a little bit more of the reaction or heard more of the commentary between games. But the match itself is great to watch, and the quality is relatively good."
2,Choppy,"While I'm happy to have the match on DVD, this is a poorly produced DVD. They cut off the video/sound (mid player step/mid announcer sentence) at the end of games to jump forward to the start of the next. There's no rhythm, flow or transitions. Why not let us see the players returning to their seats and/or thinking through their issues on the change-overs? The whole match feels compressed and choppy, which is a shame. The tennis being played is wonderful and the result adds a big chapter to the tennis history books - it deserves a much better DVD than this."
4,"Strange, dirty, funny, and disgusting","I'd bought this book as a teenager from K-Mart because I thought the cover was funny.WOW, a story of a new york jew, a perverted, smoking, drinking, drug-using creature who is down on his luck, but still manages time to stalk and peep on his neighbor.I dont remember the rest of it, other than the descriotion of the worst stereotypical thing you could imagine viewing on stage in a gay bar.He somehow made it funny, haha."
2,not what i expected,"when you think of blue ribbon winners it reminds me of special, homey, can't wait to have it again food. this book fell flat. .these are festivals winners, and example of recipe in book is CREPES filled with Spinach Vera Cruz. I'm sorry ,when i read title i expected more of a comfort, homey foods cookbook to enjoy."
5,this movie rocks,buy it don't be a dork and rent it you'll be wasting 3 dollars just buy it save your 3 dollars for some popcorn and rubarb.
5,Help me! I'm obessed w/ Ranma 1/2!,"This movie was funny! I have seen four times and I still find it hillarious! There was not a lot of blood, but more than in the books. Ranma's voice sound way different in this than the other shows. You have to make sure to watch ALL of the vidoe at the end! You need to know the plot of the series before you start, or you'll be weirded out. If you don't want an obession that will take over your whole life, I suggest you stop now. Ranma Nibun No Ichi is the best thing around! I'm dying to go to Nerima, Tokyo to meet everyone! (Incase you haven't noticed I have I thing for Ryouga....)"
2,Not so good...,"I was little disapointed about this movie.The jokes were old and used.It gave me nothing new.Even though I like Ranma 1/2, this movie really let me down and I didn't even like the voice acters.Tatewaki, Happosai, Mousse, Nabiki and Ryoga got good voices.I hope ""Nihao my concubine"" is better.I think the videos, whitch are based on Rumikos original manga books are LOT better. (sorry 'bout my bad english)"
4,"Mousse, Kuno, Ranma, Shampoo. What more could one want?","Though a bigger fan of the magna series than the T.V. show, I was amazed at how well the movie leant toward the traditional magna series. From the chase at the begining to the conclusion at the end, it was all typical Ranma. There are some great fighting scenes as well as a healthy supply of jokes to break the ice. The only fault with it were some of the scenes with Akane and Kirin, Ranma just was'nt meant to be that serious. (My humble opion. If your a fan of the T.V. series or the magna, I strongly recomened it."
2,"Fun for Ranma 1/2 fans, boring for every one else.","This film has a plot similar to marial arts drama movies than a traditional Ranma 1/2 film. The movie was good in that it had a large cast an a few good jokes, but that is it. As for a DVD, it rates very poor. The sound is VHS quality, an the video seems to be lacking. There are not a lot of features which you would find in a DVD. What it does have is a nice character profile section which includes an animatied portion so you know how the charater acts. My recomendation is that unless you are a Ranma 1/2 fan, save money a purchase the second movie: Ranma 1/2 The Movie 2: Nihao My Concubine."
3,1st ranma 1/2 movie just OK,"This movie will likely be adored by dedicated Ranma 1/2 ""otaku"", but found merely interesting by ordinary ""fans"".I found the movie pretty enjoyable, but found it lacking the cuteness of the TV and OAV series. The movie starts with a quick role call of all the main characters, and some of the minor ones. A good idea, but it wasn't cute at all since it centered on Happosai. Several interesting new characters are later introduced and put to good use with food references and fight scenes. Things seemed to get better as the movie went along. The ending was predictable, but not-too-bad.If you already have a Ranma 1/2 library, you'll want to add this to your collection. Other folks may want to rent it first."
5,Action packed martial arts mayhem,This video is filled with some of the best action/fighting scenes found in the Ranma 1/2 series. Heart warming and hilarious hijinks helps make this one of the best story-lines to date.
5,"Without a doubt, the most informative book on war ever.","I have read all three editions of this book (and several of Dunnigans other books on contemporary military matters) and wish to say that ""How to Make War"" is the best overall guide to not just war, but to military affairs ever written. His style is highly readable, and he knows all aspects of his subject very well (would that more policy makers and military people would pick it up). In an area of inquiry that is both so important and so widely misunderstood, it is a real benefit to those in government, industry, academia, and the military who wish to really understand military matters. I have read all editions more than once and find myself using the book frequently for reference in my work."
5,packed with info.,"When researching my novel THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE (available on this site, incidentally) I used HOW TO MAKE WAR for my research so as to make the ordnance section of my novel authentic. This is a well-written and well-thought-out book, and I highly recommend it."
4,what's your style? you'll find it here.,"not many of the artists on this soudtrack are smash-hit makers, multi-grammy winners, or even household names. but the ecclectic mix of tunes on this cd would make you think otherwise. this is an album you can pop in just about anywhere at anytime and find the song you're in the mood for.judith owen's 'creatures of habit' is one of my favorites (and my mom's!) well as 'get into it', judith's other song on the album. the upbeat guitar stylings of jon jacobsen's 'i'm alone' brings a taste of rock to the album. the slow jazzy tune, 'how do you like me now' by joe pesci is also one of my faves, and also backstreet boys' 'the perfect fan.'it's hard for me to just choose one, because all of these songs together make this album a nice addition to your cd library."
5,Chilling Account of IBM Involvement in the Holocaust,"Well researched, detailed account of the unknown key role IBM played in making the holocaust so overwhelmingly devastating. The account gripped my attention from page one to the end. It is eye-opening.IBM AND THE HOLOCAUST"
4,Very Interesting History,"This book, extremely well documented, gives interesting insight into the ethics of big business. Enron cost investors and employees their life savings; Deomag (the German subsidiary of IBM) cost many Jews their lives. It permits a stark view of corporate decision making.I used scenarios, pulled from this book, as part of a course on ethics and professional practice for computer scientists. It was interesting to try applying modern engineering codes of ethics to work in Nazi occupied Europe (and contemporary IBM New York offices).Given the stigma of associating a company with Hitler's Final Solution, I held the book to a fairly high standard of proof; the book certainly delivered. Documentation, public where possible, from private interviews where not, is meticulously presented and thoroughly cross referenced. If this topic holds interest for you, this book is a compelling, informative read."
5,"IBM, Hitler and WWII",Here's the complete story of Big Blue and how it helped hitler before and during WWII - and gotaway with it. Amazing. Disgusting. And it appears to be VERY well documented as the truth.
4,IBM and the Holocaust,"This book is one of the most interesting factual books I have ever read. It is worth the read, but not for the assumptions made in it, to say that IBM can be held as a responsible party for the mass executions is not a fair accusation. However, it has raised many questions in my mind, about the involvment of IBM in Nazi Germany. I'm sure this is raising some questions at IBM also. It seems unthinkable that corporate America could have been invovled in this genocide, but Edwin Black brings it to life. He has brought the Holocaust closer to home than any historian or history book ever has or ever will."
4,Disturbing read,"It saddens me that a company I admire has such a dark mark on its past. I am sure Watson Sr knew what his machines were being used for. His drive to build a bigger company just superceded a moral one.I have read several books on IBM history and, while they mention Watson Sr giving back Hitler's medal, none of them care to mention that business went on as usual.I currently collect IBM punch cards and would like to get some from the war years."
4,A fascinating but disturbing story,"A well researched and written account of events in history I trust were unknown to most Americans. The story is fascinating but very disturbing, offering a vivid account of what happens when profit is valued above morality. It's always disturbing to see instances of such disregard of the truth and the consequences of those actions. This is a great read not only because of the story but also for the lessons that should be learned."
5,How much did we really know?????????,"This book was really great. It puts into how the punch card system worked, what the holes meant and more. To make things more interesting, how much did IBM New York know about the things that were going on with their Eurpeon counterpart. IBM blantely knew that hellping Nazi Germany would be a great assest to make money, after alll Business was its middle name. Although everything was leased to the Nazi's rather than bought. This is truel a chilling tail."
5,Powerful Indictment of IBM,"Edwin Black has constructed a powerful indictment of IBM's dealings with Hitler, an arrangement that clearly intensified the killing rate. As one who has read numerous Holocaust books--I find Black's book an extraordinary accomplishment on any level."
2,A one-sided account,"""It was an irony of the war that IBM equipment was used to encode and decode for both sides of the conflict"" (p. 344). Too bad there wasn't more info like that that actually looked at IBMs role in winning the war to counterbalance this decidedly one-sided account. Every step that IBM made during the war years is portrayed as evil and just doesn't ring true to me. If you're going to give IBM this sort of treatment, you're going to have to go after hundreds if not thousands of other companies who backed the Hitler regime. After I finished reading this book I wasn't convinced that IBM was all that different than any other corporation that did business with Germany at that time and am still scratching my head trying to figure out why they were singled out. Bad judgment in high places is nothing new and, motivated by their hatred of Jews, a rabid Nazi with a pencil could've given an IBM Hollerith machine a run for its money if he had been forced to."
2,"Interesting, but....","While this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature, I do have some critical comments to make.Firstly, it is apparent that the author's own holocaust experiences (or more specifically, those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented.Secondly, there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get, in my opinion, a few pieces of interesting material.Finally, the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened, or would not have been so sever, is (again in my opinion) flawed. As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM.Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading."
3,great expose but could have done with some editing,"This is a brilliant expose of IBM duplicity in WW2 - selling to both sides and getting away with it. It also show how IBM technology helped the Nazis to organise many activities including, of course, the final solution.So why only three stars? The book is too low level - there is to much detail, so much so that sometimes one loses track of the higher level story being narrated. It would have been better to make it half the size - or to move more of the narrative to the footnotes. I don't know if this is the way Black writes or he felt he needed to be this specific to prove his assertions but it does make the book heavy going for the casual reader."
3,Depressing,"This book shows just how corrupt and weak mankind can be , I'm not Jewish and have always found the German response to Nazi nationalism fascinating and scary so I didn't go into this blind but why is man so ready to turn on each other for a dollar ? Side note : IBM was not alone in this"
3,Interesting Perspectives,"This book represents a significant effort to bring together two groups that rarely meet to address the issues that both bind and divide them. The articles in this edited volume were written for presentation at a conference in 1995 on the same subject and they reflect serious efforts by participants from both groups to reach new levels of understanding.Each area of discussion is addressed by an Arab and an Iranian writer, which lends a sense of balance not often found in scholarly works of this type. The topics addressed include border and territorial disputes, civil society, media and schoolbook portrayals of each side, economic and political ties, and others.With so many books addressing relations between the West and other parts of the world, this volume is refreshing both in concept and subject matter. While it is not for those new to the Middle East, it can provide specialists with useful perspectives and information about this important relationship."
3,Plastic,Cute design but will the birds roast inside a plastic birdhouse?I have yet to determine if this is weather proof.
2,Broke within 2 months,"I bought it to replace another birdhouse, it is very small but cute. I hung it up and the ring that holds the line came out of the trailer, I might be able to glue it back in but I don't think it will stay in for long. so now it sits on a table as decoration."
4,Cute Birdhouse,I ordered this as a novelty Mother's Day gift. It was well-received and did not disappoint. I thought it was a very cute little birdhouse...though it is plastic and I'm not sure about it's functionality. But still...cute item and not at a very expensive price.
2,Not practical,"This item is too small to be use as a real birdhouse, I fault myself in not looking at the dimension before the order. The seller should though label it as decorative only."
2,tarnished and scratched easy,"I was hoping this was like one of those keychains that that twists and you could add keys easily. (I have one from Toyota). But this was just a normal keychain. Plus, after a few months it tarnished and the metal scratched off easy. Not really worth the money in my opinion."
4,Beautiful keychain,"This is a beautiful keychain, the picture does not make it justice, very sturdy. Only con is that the key ring is to thick and Honda's key's don't swivel well, this makes it to be kind of bulky on your pocket."
1,Blurred portions,"The first disk is AWESOME! But the last 4 disks are awful! I was really disapointed with the blurred portions. I realize that while they had to change the name from the WWF to the WWE because of the lawsuit they were only trying to protect themselves by doing this. HOWEVER, it gets pretty annoying when the wrestlers step into the blurred portions and you can no longer tell what excatly they are doing! I own the Rey Mysterio Set which operates during the same time period and it doesn't have any blurred spots in it. Personally I would never have purchased this if I had known about the blurryness, it was a complete waste of money!"
3,Pretty good book,"This is a pretty good book. I am a thirteen year old fan of Agatha Christie and I loved the story 'Three blind Mice'. It's a pretty good read, and if you're on of those first time people, I suggest reading it because this book will make you wanna read more of her books and this IS NOT one of her crappy books."
4,Ghost Stories from around the world,"I must admit to being a little biased, in this review, as one of my own encounters of realms beyond the tangible, is included in this book. (My story tells of buying a house,on the beautiful coast of Cornwall... complete with a Curse, at no extra charge).But this recently published,compilation of stories, is gathered from ""regular"" peoples experiencies with supernatural or un-explained events.The stories describe how they encountered , dealt with and incorporated another dimension into their lives.Some of the stories are slightly humourous. All of the storytellers challenge our perceptions of what is normal and rational.The stories are gathered from all over the world and from people who are not traditional ""ghosthunters.""Hopefully this book will absorb and entrance you...As there is currently, far too much black and white reality in todays world.This book will be a welcome introduction to a different dimension . No conspiracies or cover ups here!"
2,A VERY mixed bag,"Glenn Park is an experienced teacher of the Alexander Technique, with much to say on the subject. To this extent the book might be useful to students of the Technique.BUT, the Technique is consistently subordinated to the whole gamut of New Age (rhymes with sewage) enthusiasms. We got Auras, we got Chakras, we got hundredth monkeys, we got 'energy' in every imaginable (but not verifiable) form. Park actually includes F.M. Alexander's horoscope!An experienced student of the Technique, equipped with a wheelbarrow of large grains of salt, will find helpful information on the Technique, IF they can dig it out of the dreck."
4,The future of the electric guitar?,"Seattle prepared guitar maven Bill Horist has hit his stride on his second release. With a battered Teisco, an arsenal of rack effects and stomp boxes, and a bizarre assortment of metal and wooden objects, surgical instruments and cymbals Horist creates lush percussive and droning soundscapes, 11 of which have been documented on this CD.Songs From The Nerve Wheel will certainly challenge many listeners' definitions of what constitutes music, but that doesn't mean that these atonal and microtonal explorations are the work of a cool snobbish aesthete. In fact, Horist brings a refreshing amount of enthusiasm to his music, and it shows.While no recording could possibly capture the visual element of Mr. Horist molesting his guitar and pedals, the sounds captured on this disc stand on their own quite well. This CD is challenging, rewarding listening, and is well worth picking up."
2,painfully slow moving album,"I have attempted to listen to this album on several occasions with the hope that after getting accustomed to Ms. Shank's voice I would start to enjoy the album. Well....it did not happen. The album's pace is painfully slow, her phrasing is so deliberate that I find myself dosing off waiting for the next word to come out of her mouth. Her voice for me, is just to plain. I do not hear any emotion in it. The upside to the album is that the recording is outstanding. It however does not overcome the bordom that comes over me while listening. I have heard very ""live like"" recordings of birds chirping but it does not do much for me either.I have three other mapleshade recordings, Larry Willis, Walter Booker and Sunny Sumter. All three are outstanding. You may want to give these a listen before trying out Ms. Shank."
1,Ehhh...,What happened to them? Gone is the originality. It's all a reminder of those who have already written this previously. I like the more gospel/christian tunes though.
4,C ANON PIXMA 530,Works very much as expected.As good as my Epson Photo EX.Fax works.Scanner works well.Paper tray is really small (70ish sheets).A bit louder and a bit slower than expected (not that I would call it either loud or slow).Paid $130 with Amazon credit card discount.
1,Guzzles Ink and Give Errors,"The print quality is adequate but canon made the machine ultra sensitive to the ink sensors. It also sucks up the ink even when you don't use it. I avoided printing in color, but within a few months the color ink disappeared anyway, and once ink is empty you can't print anything, even in black. They also don't want anyone using non-canon ink but and in the process of creating this sensitivity a lot of unnecessary errors come that lock up the entire machine. While it works if you keep buying canon ink expect to spend hundreds of dollars on ink every year. Don't buy this machine!"
1,a disaser and a rip off,"Nothing that Canon offer is true. the quality of the color is well below average, indeed very poor. the ink last for no more than some copies and the price of the cartridges are well above average. I can't describe all of the difficulties I have faced with this product. And if you have time, try to contact the customer service, an average waiting time of more than half and hour as a mimimum. And you never get the right answer. I am considering taking the product to the garbage. And for the price, almost $200 you can buy a laser printer that work better. Avoid this product!"
4,Good All-In-One for small business,"I have used this machine for two months now and I am extremely pleased with its performance. Printing and copying is quiet, clear and fast. The Quick Start Setup was easy to follow but did not include the information necessary to set up the fax. Unfortunately, the nearly incomprehensible printed manual included in the box did not help and the online manual offered no help whatsoever. If the manual had been better, I would have rated this machine 5 stars.In the past, I have owned and used HP, Epson and Brother All-In-Ones and so far, I like this one better than any other ever used (except for the manual)."
2,Auto-feed Quit After 1 Year of *Light* use,"Disappointed with the quality of the ADF function on the scanner... I only used it occasionally, yet now it gives an error 90% of the time after about a year of use."
3,Bulky and frustrating,"I used to have an HP four in one. I had no problems with it. I cannot get this fax to work properly and the color photos tend to run on my glossy paper. There seem to be a lot of different settings for paper choices. If you do not buy the Canon-brand paper, you are left guessing regarding which setting to use. The item is VERY bulky. I do like the flatbed scanner and the ease with which I can scan and create PDF documents."
1,not good whatsoever,"Ive had this printer for 6 months, I have gone through countless ink cartridges (which are very small and overpriced) and I do not print that often. Now I have an error code and none of the functions work (print or scan) Waste of $200. Im throwing it away!"
1,Avoid this scam,"This printer worked fine for about a year. But every time it cleans the print head it dumps about 5 print pages worth of ink into an inaccessible receptacle in the chassis. So when the receptacle is full, one of the bottom rollers picks up the ink, painting a big black stripe on the back of each page. And after you use the bottom cleaning function, it immediately dumps more ink, filling it up again! This is deliberate, malicious built-in sabotage, forcing you to buy a new machine. A repair shop said it would cost more to take it apart and clean it than it would to replace it. Better idea: don't buy it in the first place."
2,Good printer poor software,"This is a good printer, copier, fax. However the scanner features are very limited. I switched from a basic model HP and it had better software features regarding the scan options."
5,So far I'm delighted,"So far, I'm delighted with this little machine. I hook it up and it's ready to print. I'm still working with the scanning. I don't have a land line, so I haven't tested fax capabilities. But, so far, printing and copying have been fine. Set up was extremely easy."
2,Ink Evaporates,"This machine is easy to use and the printing/copying is superior, but the ink evaporates. When I first bought it, I was using it all the time. It seemed like I was going through more ink that my previous Canon copier, but I was doing a lot of printing. What bothered me is that I was doing all black printing and the color cartridges were running out. Now I only print or copy a couple of sheets a month and I go through two to three sets of cartridges a year, including the color cartridges which I NEVER use. I LOVED my previous Canon copier, but I hate this one. I'm currently in the process of looking for a new 4 in 1 machine. I was going to give away or donate this one, but I don't want to stick anyone with this piece of junk, so I'm going to recycle it."
2,bad printer,I purchased this printer about a year and a half ago. it worked well for a while. after year my printer started making these grinding sounds after it finished a printing job. I was much happier with my old HP that lasted me five years (I only had to get rid of it when HP stopped supporting it).
3,Okay printer,The main reason I purchased this printer was because of its batch feed capabilities for scannin and faxing. The feature works well but the software interface is not the best.The ink cartridges need replacing alot faster then any of the previous HPs that I have owned.Print quality is fine.Overall I am satisfied but if I had the choice I would go back to HP.
2,SUCKS INK LIKE A SPONGE! MEMORY USE FUNCTION???,"I use this printer/fax very sparingly because of the problems. One, the ink disappears after very little usage; The cartridges are so poor that the ink is simply drying out. Very, very, very disappointed. I have older, smaller printers that the ink last 5X longer! Secondly, the memory light has a mind of its own. it lights up saying there is a document in memory, when you go thru the step process to print from memory, there is nothing there. I've powered down/up hoping it will reset, but theres that light again. after abt a week, it goes out! Third, the fax documents will shift and cut off the bottom of a page. I've tested this with Canon customer svc where they would fax a doc to me and sure enought the bottom is cut off. NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT."
3,Bulk sized,"This product is heavy and occupies space. It works well. However, remember there is a chip in every ink cartridge, and it is a real pain in your neck. Once ink in the cartridge is low all the functions are frozen and nothing (Fax/printer/scanner) works unless you install costly original Canon ink. There is no way around.This prompted me to work with a company that is going to make a overriding device where you could do reset the chip multiple times. This product is now available in Europe, and it would be launched in U.S. shortly.I have been using this product for more than 13 months,and bought it when it was priced 158 dollars. Now it is priced just over 100 dollars.I would recommend this product if you are willing to pay for the costly original ink cartridge."
1,High Mantenaince!,"Worst printer I ever bought. From day one it had constant erroneous errors...stating that there were more than one cyan ink tank installed when there was not, stating that the ink cartridges were empty when they were not. I am constantly lifting the cover and fiddling with the ink tank just to get the damn thing to reset and print. Sucked up entire ink tank in 2 weeks of use...and I do not print very much!Save your money and your aggrevation and buy an HP!"
2,B&W Duplex Printing Uses Color Inks,"I wish I had known before I purchased this that printing in duplex with ""Grayscale Printing"" selected would soak up the color inks. Apparently, on single-sided printing this option will work as advertised, but, on duplex printing color ink is liberally used (to prevent smearing.) I wanted duplex printing to save on paper but now I'm stuck trying to decide whether I want the convenience of double-sided printing and use up the color ink on b&w print, or, go single-sided only. Looks like it'll be single-sided only. Color ink is too expensive."
4,--good printing speed,Husband thought I needed to update my old printer with a new one and this is it. Copies well and with speed needed to get the job done. It has many features and I am not sure I will use them all. The fax feature--I read the directions and got that overwhelmed feeling and gave up. Prints photos with wonderful quality.
4,Great Pictures,"I have not had any problems with this printer. I have had it for just over a month. I have not needed to use the fax so I can not comment on that. Setup was quick and easy. The 4x6 pics are wonderful. The software that comes with it has red eye reduction, and it is the best I have ever seen. At this point I am very satisfied with my choice. I am also very impressed with Amazon and will do more ordering from them in the future. My printer arrived in just two days."
3,Complexity,"The downside of a flexible system is complexity. It reminds me why I am a Mac rather than a PC user. Engineers (yes, I am one too) love geekiness. Simplicity is often not a consideration. The MP530 Office All-In-One Photo Printer with Fax is not easy to set up. This system works OK, but we still haven't figured out how to make it print full-sized, as opposed to half-sized micro-print, pages from the computer. Yesterday I decided that a phone call to tech-support was the only way. The manual seemed unable to help. Why oh why can they not make it simple with easy-to configure on-screen setup using the computer, not the All-In-One. Geeks!"
1,Broke after one week,"Out of the box, the printer had an error message. By recycling the power on and off, I was able to get it working temporarily. Unfortunately, a week later, it is now dead with the message ""check printer"". I called Canon, who said that they couldn't fix it over the phone. I called their repair center in Berkeley, but they didn't know how to fix it or how to even get there with the broken freeway."
5,This all-in-one printer is great!!,I purchased the canon printer a few weeks ago and I love it. It's easy to use and it prints great pictures. I took alot of time and read alot of feedback on different all-in-one's and I'm glad I went with this one. I'm still using the original ink cartridges that came with it. That surprised me because they usually run out quick. It's also pretty quiet too.This is an update to this review. It has now been almost 5 months and I am just changing out the ink cartridge for the magenta and the bigger of the 2 black. I have printed alot including making my own brochures. Everything is still running great.
5,Best for the Money,"This thing is amazing, I got it for $164 with free shipping. We use it for making copies, scans and printing for homeschool. We love it, and it prints quality pics and duplexes. You can't go wrong with this one."
4,MP530 MultiFunction,"The unit was DOA from Amazon, however, Canon promptly supplied a replacement unit. Two complaints: it seems to reject cartridges as empty or in need of reseating frequntly and the paper cassette generates a frequent feed or jam error. For a photo printer the colors are considerably off compared to my Canon i9900, but overall results for printing, copying and FAXing are good."
3,lasts only a year,"I loved this printer when I first brought it home. It does print amazing photos. I had it for a year when BOTH paper feeds broke. Mind you, I do not even use the printer on a daily basis. I now need to buy a new one. I love Canon but am debating another company."
4,Amazon has great customer service.,The first printer received had a flaw (loud machine gun noise)that Canon could not fix with phone assistance. They wanted to replace it with a rebuilt printer which was not a option for me because I payed for a new printer. The second option was to take it to be repaired. I emailed amazon and they immediatly offered to replace it free of change. I have purchased items in the past from Amazon and will continue to do so in the future.
5,Canon Pixma MP530,"I am very pleased with this all-in-one printer. It is very easy to use and the quality of the copies is excellent. Mine is pretty new and I am still learning to use all of the features, but I would highly recommend this product. I am also very happy with the speed of the printing."
1,I am a very very dissatisfied consumer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,I am a very dissastified customer. I spend enough money on this product and no seems to help me out. I've had problems ever since I got it. I have talked to techs and no seems to know what they are talking about. if I would of known it was going to be such a pain I wouldn't of bought it. My brother was the one that said it was a great product and I took his word. I had a hp and I never had a problem with it. I would like to return it and get my money back. I bought it in August.
2,Good printer uses ink very quickly even for black-and-white,"I really like the printer in terms of a multi-function device, and it would get 5 starts except for what appears to be a bug (or marketing feature) -- black-and-white printing in duplex mode still uses the color cartridges. That means either you need to use twice the paper or blow through a lot of very expensive ink for simple documents or faxes. So if you run out of one of the color cartridges you can no longer print b&w; docs - period. It's a serious shortcoming of the printer.I would seriously investigate other printers before buying this one again."
4,canon pixma MP530 printer,"The MP530 has performed perfectly from day one. A very reasonable price. The scan and fax features are great. The picture printing isn't as good as I had hoped for. The biggest draw back is the price of the ink replacement, the colored ink goes pretty fast."
4,Works superbly.,"I've had this printer for about 6 moths now and it has worked flawlessly. It does everything it claims to do and without flaws or complications. The software is not quite as intuitive as one might hope, but not excessively complex. It would be nice if the ink cartridges lasted a little longer they do. I don't do a lot of printing and have already had to change the black cartridge twice and it's almost time to change the colors, too. Overall, it's a great product for the price."
4,Canon MP530,"This is my first Canon Printer. I am very pleased with it. It is quick and fairly quiet for printing. It is very versatile with many functions. The ink lasts and is fairly inexpensive. The scanning is easy, but not top quality. I do like the on-screen scanning directions. Faxing is very easy. My only complaints are primarily with the main paper tray. In order to access it you must close up the printed paper holder by removing all your work, then pull out the tray to refill it. I have not yet used all the functions, but currently I would recommend this machine to anyone with a small business or home usage."
5,NIce Package!,"Great all-in-one for the home/home-office. The operator panel is well laid out and easy to use, multiple paper inputs, easy access to glass or internal. Ink cartridges are many, but easy and very friendly! Print speed is not blazing but not bad at all. Photo print qhality is quite good. Overall, just a nice package for scan, fax, copy, color print."
5,Awesome,"I bought this printer for my mother and she loved it so I decided to buy me one and I love it. It is very easy to use and has all the features that I need. My pictures print out Excellently. I scan in a lot of photos and art work of my children and it scans in perfectly. It is fast, quiet and easy to use. It really is the best All-In-One printer that you can buy. I shopped around and Amazon was the least expensive and had free shipping."
4,"Great, but complicated","I'm a technical kind of guy - been a programmer for 25 years, but this all-in-one confused the heck out of me. I actually had to read the manual to figure it out, and I still have to refer back to it all the time. However, once you figure it out, it's a great device!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,"the reviews on here are probably from people who like to pay hundreds of dollars for ink and then have no problem with a broken printer (or the Canon PR people- they seem to have high ratings on their site too). just google all the issues with this thing, if the ink is low it wont print, copy, or scan. Then, when you try all the troubleshooting techniques, Canon basically acknowledges their design flaws. Seriously, I've never been so upset with a product before. Unless all 5 of your ink cartridges are full, it WILL NOT PRINT, SCAN, FAX, or COPY. If you are low on ink, tough luck. I have a giant paper weight, and I'm not too enthusiastic about the irony in that."
1,PAPER JAMMED,"AMAZON SHOULD NOT HAVE SOLD THIS MP530 PRINTER. AFTER PRINTING A FEW PAGES, THE ALARM LIGHT COMES ON AND IT STATES "" PAPER JAMMED."" TO DO MORE PRINTING YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE PAPER, RAISE THE SECTION WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE INK JETS THEN LOWER,AND THEN PUSH THE "" OK "" BUTTON. FROM THEN ON YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS PROCESS FOR EACH SHEET PRINTED. THE FIRST 2 WEEKS, I JUST UNPLUGGED THE PRINTER AND USED MY WIFE'S PRINTER AND REPLUG THE NEXT DAY. MANY TIMES I THOUGHT I WOULD SEND IT BACK BUT WHY SPEND THE SHIPPING COST. CANON WILL SELL A NEW PRINTER FOR JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN I PAID FOR THIS WORN OUT MACHINE; HOWEVER MY INK JETS COULD NOT BE USED IN THEIR NEW PRINTERS."
4,Good Machine So Far,"This machine has been working pretty good so far. I've only had it about a month. It DOES use up large amounts of ink. I've already changed one of the cartridges twice in one month! Other than that, it's alittle slow, but it seems most Canon's are. It's very quiet, and the quality is good. I looked online at reviews and it seemed as if I had to pick between machines that used up large amounts of ink or ones that got poor ratings for quality. I chose to buy this one because I would rather repalce ink cartidges than the equipment itself. I still have not figured out some of the fax machine's options, but so far so good with the rest."
1,Canon's Smartchip Ink Tanks Are Expensive,"Canon is very clever. They have now put smartchips in their ink tanks so you can't refill them or replace them with generic ink tanks. The chip knows that it was on an empty tank and won't let you transfer it to a full generic tank either. The printer won't print, thinks it's out of ink and won't budge. Generic ink is about $7 to top off all colors. Canon smarchip tanks about $70.00 for a full set. I figure that's about 30 cents a page to print. I will never buy another Canon. If I sold you a brand new Lexus for only $20,000 but it would only run on fuel you had to buy from me at $30.00 per gallon, would that be fair? There must be a special place in hell for those clever, greedy little buggers."
1,Beware of design flaw,"Don't run out of ink - be sure you have extra ink cartridges on hand. When the check ink alarm light is on, all functions shut down. Obviously, you can't print, but you cannot scan or fax either. Canon tech support explained that all ink cartridges must contain ink for the fax and scanner to work. I wish I had known this before I bought it - this is a major inconvenience. I considered returning it to Amazon, but the shipping charges (the original, no longer ""free"" shipping + the return shipping = $54) aren't worth it."
3,Great printer - totally bogus DRM on the ink cartridges,"I've had this printer for 8 months now, and I have no complaints whatsoever with the print quality, software or the features. However, Canon's little game with putting chips on their ink cartridges is completely lame and customer aggresive. What they are trying to do of course is force you to buy carts from them, by hiding behind the DMCA, claiming that anyone who reverse engineers this little chip is ""circumventing content management"". What a crock!This printer is great in every respect except this corporate-extortion attempt to force ink sales. Imagine if Ford only allowed Ford parts to be used on their cars, or else the car wouldn't start. Nobody would buy Fords anymore. That's what I recommend. Do not buy any Canon products until they get rid of this ridiculous attempt to grab a few bucks."
5,Everything and more!,"This product was everything that it says that it is. It does everything and the ink takes forever to run out. The only thing that I will mention is that buy the 4 ink cartridge and the large ink cartride that comes seperate. The black large cartridge runs out first and must be replaced then the printer uses the small well. I tried to bypass this and it didn't work. It is worth it to have it in our home. Great for pics, copies, printing and the fax is good also."
5,Great multi function,"The pictures print great, just beautiful. The scanner works easily with good quality. The color copier is great as well."
5,Canon PIXMA MP530 is an excellent all-in-one,"This multi-function printer/scanner/copier/FAX was an excellent buy at the price I received on Amazon.com. It's fast and gives a good output. I upgraded from an old HP-600 Officejet, and it's obvious that the tecnology has advanced. However, I'm getting low ink warnings after a short time use of the ink tanks - were they just partially filled ones supplied ""free"" with this low cost printer? Nevertheless. it's still a great value for well under $200!"
1,Had two- both broke.,"This printer is terrible! The first one I bought showed an error message that was not only incorrect (it said there was a missing ink cartridge when all were properly installed) but could not be cleared. Canon had me send it to them and in return they sent me a refurbished unit. The refurbished unit does not scan properly. The scanner gets ""stuck"" after about 2/3 of the page and the unit must be turned off and turned back on to resume printing. The result is a copy (or scan) that is muddled and blurry on one side.The really terrible thing about the ""new"" unit is the noise it makes when the cartridges return to the original position after printing. It sound like the buzzing of a child's wind-up toy, only 100 times louder, and lasts 15 seconds. I cannot make a phone call or carry on a conversation while printing for this reason.The only good point: it did print well for about a week before breaking!"
4,Very good all-in-one photo printer,"I bought this printer from amazon.com. Nicely arrived before scheduled time. Great photo printing. Copying is very cool, with features like both color or b/w. Really enjoying it.Both side printing kind of works sometime.These printers are great product for such a low price, because they planned to make money from the ink you buy. They have chips in their ink catridges to avoid you going after market catridges for refills.If you do choose go after market catridges, changing the chip from old oem catridge into after market catridge is little bit harder.But you will loose nice elegant feature, monitoring ink level functionality from the computer. And you have start monitoring ink level manually atleast once a each week."
3,Evaluation,Copying & printing very good. But drivers have a bug in them that activate aAdobe proxy process (apdproxy.exe) that will consume 100% of your Cpu. Canonsays it's not there problem. They will need to fix this. When are we going to see a hardware manufacturer accept responsibility for there hardware and drivers.
1,Very unreliable,"Don't buy this printer if you're looking for reliability. It has broken down in multiple ways over the last year and a half. Call me crazy, but I'd expect a printer like this to last more than 18 months. Each time we seem to be able to find a work around or quick fix, but we've finally run out of luck. Now the paper won't feed and we can't print anything. Overall a piece of trash and I'll make sure to avoid all Canon products from here on out."
2,Beware Printer Eats Ink,"This would be an excellent printer if it would print in black only, but apparently it will not. After many attempts to get the printer set up to use only the black cartridge for black printing it is becoming obvious this printer was made to eat all the color tanks. I have had to replace the color inks numerous times while printing in B&W, even though Canon site claims that you can set it to use only black. It does not work. This printer is an expensive ink hog and I do not recommend it. Just my opinion of course."
2,Not worth the price,"I would not purchase this printer again. If this printer were about 75 bucks...I would purchase it again. I am evaluating this on a cost per year basis. I have had it for a little over 4 years and it has been used for light to moderate home use.Its good point: Pretty economical ink usage (for a home use).Its bad points:About two years after we got this printer it started making this horrible ""machine gun"" clicking sound. It did not appear to hinder its ability to work - its just extremely loud and goes on for 15 - 45 seconds at a time.After about 3 years it started putting black streaks on the back-side of every document. We would clean the heads and that would work for a WHILE. After a while - this cleaning procedure no longer worked.No wifi.This printer has a lot of great features - but that doesn't really matter if it doesn't work properly for more than a few years at this price (499 usd)."
4,"Very, very disappointed","I originally wrote a four-star review about this unit. But after several months of use, I've completely changed my mind. It seems that the little chips Canon puts on the cartridges to prevent you from using 3rd-party carts are either poorly engineered or intentionally designed to fail after a certain amount of time. As many others have noted in their reviews, you get error messages saying that two carts of the same color are installed, a cart is missing, a cart is faulty, etc. etc. And when that happens, you can't use the machine for anything, even scanning.Don't waste your money. Canon is trying to force you into using their carts, and in the process crippling the printer. Mine is in the dumpster after less than a year. And it was sitting crippled for most of that year. Canon should be ashamed of how they have treated their customers with this machine."
4,Very Nice Machine BUT Large Footprint,"Works great, well built, but I must say that it is 30-40% larger than my HP it replaces. I was really suprised at its size, but I hope there is something on the inside that makes up for it in the long run."
2,Great when it worked.,"Used this printer for a few months until it stopped working entirely about a week ago. Error with the magenta ink tank. At first I could pop tank out and in, and it would work again, now the printer won't function at all due to the very annoying error. Hopefully they will send me a new cartridge but the printer will be completely useless in the meantime."
5,Nice Bunk Beds!,"Love this product. Really high quality and beautifully made. It has pillows and pink mattresses. I think it should come with blankets, but overall it is adorable. The ladder was a big hit. It is nice because you can move the ladder around so that it is out of the way. My daughter loved it. Very sturdy also. I would buy again."
1,Skip it...bad CD,Poor quality music. Would almost swear that it had beenrecorded from an A.M. radio station. Does little justiceto Mr. Lanza's marvelous voice. Spend your music listeningdollars elsewhere. Unusually bad.... Instant yard sale material.
1,Don't bother,"This is my second unit. The first failed after about 3 days. (stopped turning on, either with the program or manually.) Amazon promptly sent a replacement. Unfortunately, it didn't work at all. Being in faily desperate need of a unit, I bought a Melnor 6-cycle electronic timer at Home Depot ($40). So far (10 days) it has worked flawlessly."
1,worked for 5 days,"It was easy to install. Worked beautifully for five days.Than died. Yes, I put fresh batteries and did not put them reverse.Also I know there is a reset button on it.It was a great satisfaction to put it in the garbage.Why is is so hard for engineers to design one that works?"
1,Broke after 2 weeks,"This timer worked for 2 weeks, then died. My Nelson timer lasted for a full season at least. I am going to try Orbit next."
2,Warning--Want it to turn on at 4:00AM--GET UP EARLY,"This newer Gilmour model with 2 rotary dials. It cannot be set to turn on at some later time. Unlike the older 3 push pad style, which could be set to go on at up to 23 hours from time of inital setting,this one can only be set for the current time. Want to water at 4:00 AM every 3 days, then set your clock for 4:00 AM tommorow morning so that you can program unit.Gilmour really let the consumer down on this one.BTW--Almost all of the reviews here refer to the older 9100 model with touch pads."
4,Gilmour Lawn and Garden Timer,"Product works as advertised. Easy to program. Don't know about battery life if used on a daily basis. Thank you,"
4,Love it!,"I have had two of these for about four weeks now and I love them. Just as everyone else comments, they are very easy to use and to program. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because one of them did not work upon arrival. The valve did not open or close at all. However, I returned it to Amazon and they shipped me a replacement that worked fine."
1,You might get a good one,"From reading the other reviews and from my own experience I judge this product not too reliable. I have owned two of them, and both failed after a short timeReturning when to my surprise and confusion the illustration now looks entirely different. Evidently Gilmour used the same model number for an entirely new and different unit, certainly not what rocket engineers would doHowever, I note mixed reviews, indicating a reasonable chance you might get a good one"
3,good timer-short shelf life,"I put in a sprinkler system about four years ago and used three of these to act as controllers. They are connected to PVC pipe in lieu of water hoses. they are easy to program and the 2 AA Alkaline batteries last between six to nine months, but these timere have a life span of about two and a half years. I have them mounted on a wall under the eve of my house out of the weather, so it is not like they are over exposed to the elements.I would be willing to pay up for a better made product."
2,price has gone up,"I have owned four of these. Only one of them currently works. I have been using these timers (very successfully until recently) to water large vegetable pots and another to water a LARGE string of shrubs. I am experiencing the same problem reported by almost everyone else who is reporting problems - the units won't shut off and they flood my pots. I bought the first more than two years ago. I was going to order another one since this model had lasted longer than any other irrigation timer that I have purchased. Much to my surprise, the price has gone up considerably since I last bought one (september 2008 was $32.00). Given that I have gotten more than two years of service out of only one of these timers, I will just water by hand for now. Can't anyone build a decent, durable, affordable timer these days?"
1,"Never Worked, Returned it both","I bought this product at WalMart for far less (it may have been a different model number, but otherwise looks exactly the same). I tried the instructions which said to insert the batteries in the back. I used the type of battery they said and I tried hooking it up even after resetting it the way the manual said, but ultimately, neither of them did anything. I listened for any sign that it would do something and set the dials to the shortest run time and starting cycle I could and waited and reset the two that I bought again. Never worked. I returned it to WalMart. I never had a chance to try it for a more than a season like some have mentioned, but Gilmore had a bad taste in my mouth especially if you include the really difficult maintenance of the thing having to unscrew the mounting in the back and to have to ground the battery contacts to reset it. I was not happy at all with this device."
3,Functions well but not intuitive to program,"Limitations:Minimum on time is 15 minutes.Max watering cycles per day is 1.No display, just beeps.Even with these, unit appear reliable and is OK for the price."
4,Great for our make shift sprinkler system,We were renting a place without a sprinkler system. We didn't have the time to go out everyday to water the grass so we set up a make shift sprinkler system with this. Worked great until it stopped working. Contacted the manufacturer and they promptly sent me a replacement.
2,"OUutdoor, but not water proof?","My second Gilmour timer, the previous more expensive item ""electronic timer"" version cracked right down the plastic piece that is supposed to do all the turning.So I went for the cheaper version this time, with the nice simple dials. Got a good two months out of it (maybe 30 uses?) before the batteries died. Simple fix, went to replace them, and had a torrent of water come out when I removed the battery seal. (seal is an overstatement it seems). And this is during summer!Removed the rust, and tried to dry it out, but impossible to get inside the case. Then noticed more water leaking from bottom, suggesting there are a few more drips in there than desired.Need to try some other brand. In16 months of home ownership, have gone through 2 Gilmour watertimers and two Gilmour hose sprinklers. Seems their durability is rubbish."
2,"Not Reliable, don't buy this model, save your water.","used it one season and towards the end of last summer i noticed the shut off valve was allowing water to continously pass thru. Ouch, how much water did i waste last year? Its a new season and i forgot all about that valve. I set it up and was testing the program and realized after the valve closed water was still getting by. I had to post this so others don't make the same mistake."
1,"Two attempts, two failures","Bought the model pictured (with two rotary knobs) at a local box store, but it only worked for a few days. They replaced it and it worked for three months - until the batteries died. With new batteries the valve would not stay open. It merely cycled open, paused momentarily, then closed. I'll take it back again and see if they will honor the one year warranty. Granted, it did work reliably for three months, but I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product. The settings for watering frequency and duration are somewhat limited and a bit confusing. The controls feel cheap and the sound the unit makes while opening/closing is like a cheap toy."
2,Gilmour 9100 stops working in less than a year,"A year ago, I bought two Gilmour 9100 water timers to run some soaker hoses in the gardens. They are easy to use BUT they aren't coming on automatically after about 10 months of use. The manual start works fine. The timer cuts off after the correct number of minutes. However, the timer WILL NOT START automatically. That rather defeats the purpose of having a timer. My garden turned very dry here in Texas through May and June and I am replacing plants I shouldn't have to. And yes, I did try changing the batteries."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered three of the 9100's the first week of June, 2008. I was surprised that one of the units had completely stopped working by the second week of July and then a week later a second unit failed. Replacing the batteries did not help with either of the failed units so I will be returning all three units for a refund. The refund will only be a partial refund since it has been over 30 days since I made the purchase."
2,Works for ONE summer and that's it.,"I bought the first one and loved it, so I bought the second one for the back yeard. They worked well for the entire summer and fall... so the winter came, and before freezing, I remove them and stored in an appropriated place. This year, I changed the batteries and installed them again... the first one does not turn off... if keeps on forever... and the second one, turns on... and after 5 seconds it turns off despite my configuration. Well... I will have to turn the water manually now, because I am not willing to sepend $80.00 for a machine that only works one season."
1,Don't buy this item -- its junk,I bought two of these a year ago and they bought died and since I hade a credit card extended warrenty I had to get a replacement item so I figured I would give it another try.Well both of the new items died due to moisture getting into the electronics as the unit doesn't appear to be waterproof.They also increated the price now of this model from $22.62 ti 35.99 so with more than a 50% increase in price it is definately not worth it.
1,"Junk, in a community of junk","I bought a 9100 last year to water some new grass at my campground. I set it up the 1st week, and left for the week. Next weekend, dry lawn. This timer worked by turning a ball valve 1/4 turn to go from off to on to off. Well, it just started to turn continuously until the batteries died. New batteries showed the fault. Out of luck.This year, with no choices at Lowe's, I got another. It worked for 3 months this time, and then just stopped working. Out of luck again.Looking on-line at Amazon, I am amazed at how many timers there are out there, and what a pile of crap they all make, based on reviews.I found that the only consistently well reviewed timer was the Claber series, so I have ordered that. Wish me luck."
2,Worst water timer out there,"They replaced a great timer with this junk. I've had 8, none lasted more than 6 months. 2 were broken when I took them out of the box. 4 others didn't last 2 months. I bought them because the one they replaced averaged 3 years of constant use. I was sorely mistaken. What ever you do, don't buy this junk."
1,What Happened,"I got this product as was pleased, at first. I ordered it in November and by the first of January it would not shut off. The ball inside continues to revolve from open to closed as long as the battaries are in place. I plan to order another one and see if it was just a lemon. All the other reviews were positive."
4,So Far So Good,"I have only used the product for a month, but to date I am very pleased. The Gilmour was very easy to program and install."
2,This is not what I have purchased !!!!,1-I got the white one with the less options.2-No invoice which makes the customs and the tax considered to be higher even more than its price
2,Works fine -- only for a season,"I've owned two of these. They work great for one season, but they rarely work the second season (despite changing the batteries)."
2,Bad valve,"Worked well first year. Next year the valve would not shut off water and allowed for unwanted slow and steady stream. Also, it tends to freeze up if you play with the buttons too much. The remedy is to take out the batteries for a few minutes."
1,Battery cover leaks,"I purchased 4 of these last year and only one is functional this year. The problem is the battery cover leaks water in which ruins the timer. Also, the start button is really difficult to push. I'm trying a different model this year."
3,"""Sometimes, new isn't better""","The item pictured is the newer version of the 9100. (green body)The item I purchased, the original 9100. (gray body)The original version is smarter than the new version. It has a delay feature that isn't available on the newer version. The old version is a two piece unit that allows changing the batteries much easier. One simply unsnaps the battery compartment, replace the batteries and snaps back in place. The weak point with the old 9100 is the diaphram, it tends to leak, and rupture after about a years use. I believe this problem can be corrected by simply allowing the unit to gradually turn water off rather than the abrupt method used. If the new unit uses the same shut off method, I supect it will have the same problem as the old unit, and will be more costly to repair.."
3,9400 is a much better product,"The Gilmour products are easy to use, reliable, and for a few dollars more, the 9400 offers a real-time clock, which you can set day of week. either way, both products are great."
5,"Good Timer, but it's not the one Pictured","You should note that if you order this timer you won't get the one pictured with the dials on the front. I added a customer image of what you actually will receive in the mail. This switch-a-roo was no biggie for me because I actually already have 2 of the type I received and am very happy with them. Once they are programmed they work reliably and I have never had a problem with them after 2 seasons of daily use. I just bought 2 more making 4 total that I own. They program using audible beeps only, no visual indication of what is programmed. I found the instructions fairly easy to use however you absolutely need the directions to program them. I have done it a few dozen times and I still need the directions. I wouldn't let that worry you though, I think this is the lowest cost timer you can get with multiple watering times and start stops. It's no frills but it gets the job done. Hope this helps."
3,After two years 2 of 6 have malfunctioned,"Perhaps I'm expecting too much after two years, but I have two (of 6) units that no longer work properly. They start at the program time, but no longer automatically stop. To make them stop I have to press the stop button defeating the purpose, of course, of having an automated system. I tried replacing the batteries and cleaning the contacts but still saw the problem. I know the warranty is for one year, but I still expected an item like this to last longer than two years."
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to give this toy to my daughter for her birthday. However, there is note of complaint on the package for formaldehyde. I am very grateful that this note was printed on the package so I was aware of it but wish Alex Toys would make products without formaldehyde. I would not have bought this toy if I knew of this detail beforehand. The product was returned."
4,"Good, but repetitive","I love this guy's music! His heart is definetly in every note he plays. The only problem is that he's always in the key of ""C"". I wish he could at least vary to ""D"" or something. ""F"" would be too much to ask for. Those whites must be his favorite keys. No strain to his fingers! I'd also like to see how he does with the minors. If he must stick to the whites then ""A minor"" would be fine with me, but I'd just like to hear what he would do with that. Overall, his music is very soothing. The variation of ""Frere Jaques"" is really neat. But like I said, he's got to step away from ""C"". It was too easy to plunk out his songs on my own."
5,Jim Brickman Picture This,Love all Jim Brickman's music-very relaxing and beautiful dinner music!!Would highly recommend to anyone for any occasion!!Have mos of his CDs!
5,HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY,"This is by far one of my favorite cds of all time. It is truely for the romantically inclined.But just like all of Jim's cds; the only true word to describe ""Picture This"" is relaxing. Thanks to him, we forget that we need to take a break and Jim helps us along.I fell in love with his sound when ""The Gift"" came out. I have never looked back and have enjoyed years of his tremendous gift to us: his talent.The one song that stands out among the rest of the songs is ""Valentine"" (duet with Martina McBride). That is truely the epitomy of Valentine's Day. I felt like falling in love with someone.If you must start with any Jim Brickman cd, start with this one and you will surely be hooked."
4,This is not bad at all!,"New-age music carries a bad reputation due to mediocre artists like Yanni and Tesh. But there are true musicians like Jim Brickman, George Winston, and Enya. I was in love with Jim Brickman's music when I first heard Angel Eyes on the radio. His songs are simple, and most importantly, unpretentious. I have all of his CDs and songbooks, and Picture This is in my opinion the best album. I also listen to Jim Brickman to study, and that helped me ace many exams."
5,The Best!!!!,"After seeing that there were already about 18 reviews on this CD, I pondered writing one at all. I love Jim Brickman's piano playing a lot. I just recently got three of his CD's: Picture This, By Heart, and No Words. I love them all! Picture This is my favorite, though, and I loved it so much that I bought the piano book so that I can play the songs!! : ) I recommend this CD as well as the other 2 that I mentioned before."
4,swimsuit,"The swimsuit fit wonderfully, but I did not like the colors. I tried for an exchange but it was the end of the season and my size was unavailable in another color.I ended up returning the swimsuit. Customer service had great communication and kept the whole transaction pleasant. Overall, the seller was wonderful!"
4,Dub Taylor - Detect,"Warm dubby tech-house from the label who knew how to do it right. Dub Taylor's DETECT shows off its credentials on the title track, but the warmth is only doubled with the vocals on ""Sweet Lips."" Indeed, there's a tinge of romanticism to that track. The vocals of Per Fourier aren't as strong, but they do add a nice texture, if not necessarily meaning. They emote much better with the icy detachment of ""I Can't (You Know...)."" But the more straightforward tracks like ""Observer"" have an undeniable groove, well-suited for the discerning dancefloor. ""John Wayne"" has a sweet, thrumming quality and a reverberating vocal sample that reminds me of Underworld's mellower moments. A solid undertaking."
3,The Tokyo Blah,"I love anime, I love fashion, I love Japan. But I give Bratz Tokyo-A- Go Go Eitan only 3 stars. Here's the good, the bad, the ugly:Good: Comes with LOTS of detailed accessories (laptop and CD player. The CD player opens and you can put a disk inside it, and the laptop has a disk drive, too.) It also comes with a mini-Robot action figure, a guitar, and 2 sets of clothes and shoes that you can mix and match. Lots of accessories and clothes for a good value, and it's fun to play with.Bad: The clothes are garrish, ugly, and hard to match. The doll's olive skin clashes with the orange-themed clothes and the blue highlights in Eitan's hair don't help. Though I had fun and success mixing the clothes and accessories with other Bratz doll sets.Ugly: Eitan is hard to dress and undress, because the pants he comes in have suspenders. The suspenders broke when I tried to take off his pants. Also, his second set of pants is hard to squeeze him into due to the belt."
1,The worst megaman game ever.,"When I saw this game, I was so exicited. All the battle network games have been super fun. You don't do anything in this game. You choose your chips, then watch a battle of pure luck, pressing ""R"" or ""L"" when something bad happens. See, no action at all. I highly recommend you do not this game."
5,MEGAMAN BATTLE CHIP CHALLENGE,"I own this video game and I like it very much. In one review someone said you can't battle Bass and Gateman. Well you know what you can battle them, because I have done so. Bass and Gateman are in the second part of the game (after you won the first part). I don't know about the other navis (they could be in the free battle areas). I just hope that I get some more Megaman video games for Christmas. Bye.P.S. I'm older than 12 years old."
4,NetNavis (Playable and Opponents),"I may not have played or own this game, but on the Mega Man Home Page (by typing http://www.mmhp.net/ under game list) it says that you play as either Lan and MegaMan, Maylu and Roll, Dex and GutsMan, Chaud and ProtoMan, Kai and TurboMan, and Mary and Ring. Not only do you fight Normal NetNavis, you also fight current NetOps like Arashi, Takeo, Maddy, Count Zap, Mr. Match (he has 3 NetNavis), and others with their NetNavis including AirMan, BeastMan, ColorMan/WackoMan, ElecMan, FireMan/TorchMan, FlameMan, FlashMan, FreezeMan, HeatMan, IceMan, KingMan, KnightMan, MagicMan, MagnetMan, MetalMan, NumberMan, PlantMan, QuickMan, SharkMan, SkullMan, SnakeMan, ThunderMan, ToadMan, and WoodMan.Too bad you can't fight Bass, BombMan/BlasterMan, BowlMan, BubbleMan, CutMan, DesertMan, GateMan, MistMan, NapalmMan/MoltanicMan, PharaohMan, PlanetMan, Punk, ShadowMan and anyone else that was in past games that I forgot because they're not in this game."
1,Boring as heck,"Since I'm a mega man fan, I EXPECTED this game to be awsome. I didn't get my wish. This game is of the ultimate BORING STANDARDS.Graphics:fairSound:goodAbout everything else:boringJust a strong warning, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH A MMBN FAN YOU ARE, YOU'LL HATE THIS BORING, UNORGANIZED GAME!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Lets make it simple for you.,"The game has a bad storyline, bad graphic,and way too many boring new ways of battling that makes the game horrible. I am a huge megaman fan and i am very disappointed at the way this game turned out. To make it simple for you, this game sucks. Don't buy it. It is a waste of hard earned money."
1,now this is a bunch of crap,"this game is not anywhere near topping the megaman battle network 1,2,3(those games are brilliant).this game only has fair graphics the rest of it sucks. So just please whatever you do DONT NOT BUY THIS THIS and get the megaman battle network 1,2,3,and 4(no.4 is great so far)."
5,Perfect Watch!!!,"I bought this watch for my darling husband and he he loves this watch. He is a huge fan of the Fossil brand watches. The band is heavy and very masculine. It looks nice whether you are dressed up or down, it really fits all occassions. It was a great purchase for the price."
1,I would not buy a watch from fossil,"I would not buy a watch online from fossil.My experience with their service department has been absolutely terrible. I've received DOA shipments from them, and they force you to pay return postage even if they ship dead product to you."
5,IT's Simply the best,"I got this watch one week ago. Its very good looking watch. Its $85 but looks like $150+ watch.All of my friends are asking about this watch as it catches others eye very easily.It upper dial (having number 05-15-25 etc.) rotates clock wise; this is a functionality to keep the time accurate while fast driving.Its bit heavy, but now i am used to it.I would recomend this watch to everyone who like heavy looking watches on their wrist."
3,Not much help for option trading,"If you don't have a lot of money to invest, don't think seriously about reading this book.Update: I should have explained better. I read the book and my previous review was the conclusion I drew from it. The book talks more about theories than practical tradings and seems to be better suited to tradings of huge volume. For people with ""dummy"" experience, an online option trading guide is a much better choice. You can find them in many online brokers' website."
1,Too much and too little,I found the book way too cumbersome. The author tries to write about everything financial and as a result does it very poorly.I found the section on Options especially weak. He's taken a straight forward subject and made it seem more complicated.Pass on this one!
3,Ok for Beginners!,Very descriptive in the process but you have to have some financial background to understand it all. You have to watch the history for several months to see what's going on with certain stocks.
1,Say What???,"I normally LOVE any book in the Dummies Series. But not this one! This is the first Dummies book that actually made me feel like a dummy. (And I've been investing in stocks for years and want to learn about options.) Though to be fair, I hadn't gotten very far into it before being turned off by it. I learned more about options in a free online course from CBOE, the Options Institute, and felt treated with more respect. After taking the online course I have since started back into this Dummies book and now it makes more sense, but I still don't like what I perceive to be a patronizing tone. (I shudder to think what the new revision of this book must be like... it has an average customer rating of about two stars.) Others may like this book, but count me out on this one."
5,MELISSA AND DOUG-QUALITY AND PRICE YOU CAN'T BEAT!!!!,"MELISSA AND DOUG PRODUCTS ARE OF SUPERB QUALITY, EDUCATIONAL AND A GREAAT PRICE! THAT'S WHY I BUY THEIR PUZZLES AND OTHER TOYS FOR MY 9 GRANDCHILDREN!! THANK YOU, NANA"
5,nice beautiful puzzle,It's a very nice puzzle. Fun to play with. A little bit difficult for a 3 years old. Overall a great product.
5,Great puzzles,My daughter is 2 1/2 yrs old and loves these puzzles. She does them over and over again. The wood backed pieces make them more durable than cardboard puzzles - and they are great for spatial reasoning.
3,Great picture but hard to manipulate the pieces,"We have a couple other M&D puzzles with fewer, larger pieces. The 48 piece ones we got here are by nature of their smaller piece to thickness ratio, harder to take apart and fit together. I'm hoping it gets easier and we're able to sort of break it in. Overall, great M&D quality, as always"
4,"would be five stars, but...................","If you are crazy about MP3 music this one is the best you can buy. Although you can also look pictures on it and even films this is not the reason why I bought it. Nice to have, but need to be??? No, I bought it for the music, the 40GB is great and in price absolute better than the Apple Ipod.... The extra feature using it as a extra harddisk is great. The sound setup is good en easy. All together great but It looses 1 star because the batterylife is not that great. Only to use with a AC adapter will cost 1 star. 7 hours???, I doubt it, it charges fast so that is a good thing but if there would be a possibility to use normal batteries it would be a winner forever... Still great too bad for the batterylife............."
2,A title for your review,"In brief:Dont like it. dont recommend it. dont want it anymore.At length:Battery life:Set to charge at 7:00am. unplugged at 9:00pm. Next day 9:00 am it was at half-charge. - never used it for the 12 hrs. still went down.The ""DVR100"" module:Remote stopped working on the 31st day. (just kidding - it actually worked for 2 months - and then stopped)very satisfied with the video quality for my recording, just as the product review says.audio quality of recording - poor. too much static noise.Audio quality overallHorrible. I always felt my ear wasnt THAT trained to be fazed by some noise. I know better now. After using my CD player, I cant hear the same song on this system!!!Advice to potential buyers:Please check the system to see if you are ok with the reduction in quality. otherwise go in for a piece with less features (if need be) but do not compromise on the audio quality!!!"
5,A great trip down memory lane,"What a thrill it was to finally find the music I have been looking for for so long. Betty's music is beautiful and has something for everyone, young and old alike. My grandchildren are totally enthralled by the words and music to ""The Little Blue Man."" For me, it brings back some very pleasant memories of my own youth. Her music touches me as much now as it did then. I would highly recommend any of Betty's CD's to all who love and appreciate beautiful music."
2,"Nice Pattern Adjusting, Bad Pooling @ Base","This sprinkler is great for adjusting to square yards or odd shaped yards. The big problem is it Pools alot around the base of the sprinkler, soaking that area heavily."
4,An excellent choice for fantasy lovers,"Not much sorcery, but plenty of swords, towered castles, etc, in the woman-warrior tradition. Randall writes with a good dollop of humor, too-- anyone who likes Robin McKinley's Daria series, or the Pern books or the Darkover series, should be very happy. Heroine Lyeth, a sort of knight for an evil king, finds herself tangled in battle for the crown (or in this case, ceremonial sword, hence the title) in a wintery land called Jentesi. Eventually, the story l becomes a murder mystery, but an appropriately enchanting one."
4,Clint Black Greatest Hits Vol. 2,As alway's didn't take long to recive. I didn't have any of Clint's CD's. I liked the songs on this one so I thought it was about time for one of Clint's CD's
1,A misleading description,"Everything in the article itself which is very short and summary is contained in the 29-word banner. The ideas are good, Ursula LeGuin is amazing, the article is non-existent. Don't bother."
2,You need a players guide,"I bought this game a couple of weeks ago, and it is very difficult. It is more than what I expected. I can get through the first level, but after that, I can't get much further. I have tried everything to get past the second level, but it is quite frustrating. I hope that Nintendo releases a players guide for this game soon because that would really help out alot. I got through the first Banjo-Kazooie on N64 with help from a players guide, but you need one for this game. Unless Nintendo releases a players guide, I will not be able to figure this game out."
5,THe best B-K game so far...,"If you like Banjo and Kazooie, then this game is perfect for you. Hoewever, the only returning characters are klungo, grunty, mumbo, banjo and Kazooie. There are new worlds to explore, jiggies/notes to get and the many monsters return. If you are a Banjo-Kazooie fan this game is for you..."
4,This Is A GR-R-R-REAT game (he he),This is a awosome game its simple to control fun and cool I'm reaaaallllyyy trying to beat level 4 its hard but it is fun netherless and if you want my opinon (you probably don't) 2 werds Must haveO O(^n^) <----------------japnneese banjo -!
4,Grunty's Revenge-I like it,I played both games for N64 and like it better than any Mario game but the only gripe I have for Grunty's Revenge is that I get lost a lot walking around between the 'caves'
4,A neat addition to the series,"If you haven't played the BANJO KAZOOIE games on N64 I encourage it. However, this is a nice addition to the series. A few people have stated that a players guide is needed, I don't agree. First of all, I don't use them ever for any game. Second of all, If you can read you will have little trouble with this game. If you can't read, a players guide will do you no good anyway. People ages 8 and up will find that a little searching and puzzle solving is all it takes. Stop taking the fun out of your gameplay with player guides. Okay, some are also saying that this is a 3-D game, it isn't. It's more of a view from above type game. Yes, Banjo moves in 3-D, but the environments do not. Bottomline.. if you are a fan of the series you may enjoy this addition. Also it looks pretty good on a larger screen, this is if you are playing through the Gameboy Player as I am."
2,Dissapointing,"Valenti's guide to the keyboard Partitas of J.S. Bach is an entirely subjective account of his personal interpretive whims. Written in a scripted, question and answer format (with dissapointing results) each movement of each Partita is alloted about three to five questions which, frustrating for the serious performer, tend to focus on historical asides rather than specifcs of articulation, dynamics, slurring, etc. In addition to this, these questions are often far more vague and juvenile than one would expect of an experienced musician ready to learn these monumental works. Occasionally the author will compare different editions of the Partitas and point out some important thoughts on ornamentation, but one would do better to spend the forty dollars on several good recordings of the works, which will likely be far more illuminating and enjoyable."
3,Sequel is not as good as the original,"Although this album is pleasant enough, the variety of music is not as great as the first album of The Carols of Christmas. It is OK if you want mostly guitar music. One of the tracks is misnamed (i.e., Angels From the Realms of Glory is actually Angels We Have Heard on High), and is just plain weird. Loreena Mc Kennitt's Middle-Eastern twist on God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is unusual, but has grown on me."
3,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.........,"I THOUGHT I WAS GETING EITHER TRADITIONAL CHRISTMAS MUSIC ORNEW ARRANGEMENTS OF THE OLD FAVORITES. FOR ME PERSONALLY, THERE WAS TOO MUCH PIANO AND GUTIAR SOLOS. I AM SURE THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC, IF YOU DO THEN YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS CD."
5,Best I've tried,I've been taking digestive enzymes for about 15 years and have tested numerous brands during that time. I believe I'm getting the best results from this product.Natural Factors is a very high quality manufacturer that I trust. The products are made in Canada where they actually have stricter supplement manufacturing rules than here in the States.For years I had to take medications for an illness that I managed to beat. That medicine left me with a sensitive stomach so I look for natural remedies that help digestion. I don't think there are any miracle products or quick fixes. Digestive enzymes are one of the important pieces in the puzzle and I'm very satisfied that this product is doing its job.
1,horrible product,"When I received this item the first time, it was missing the entire spray assembly. All that I recieved was the cannister and the hose. It was missing the cap to the cannister and the plunger. I called Gilmour customer service and they were useless. Amazon sent me a new sprayer and I returned the first unit. The replacement unit severely leaks from a pressed fitting that goes into thevalve head. You can't do anything to stop the leak from this pressed fitting. I will be returning this item to Amazon. Save your money, time, and frustrations and do not pruchase this item."
2,Not impressed as received - hope it lasts,I selected a commercial sprayer being tired of buying a sprayer every year.At first try the hose was leaking at the tank/hose connection and at the nozzle/hose connection.I tightened the hose clamp at the tank and it worked.The nozzle/hose connection is a pressure fitting and cannot be tightened. I ended up cutting the pressure connection and using a hose clamp. The functionality of the nozzle is now somewhat compromised since i cannot reposition the handle back but I needed the sprayer and didn't have the time to return it.At the end I am quite disappointed and take the loss.
5,Commercial Quality sprayer,"Yes, I think you know what that means. This item may cost a little more but it will last. Not only that but it makes the job much easier. A few pumps on this sprayer and your good for many sprays. It could also handle very strong industrial types of chemicals.So, if you have to do the job anyway, why not have a premium one to do it with. Don't work too hard, Retired Early ."
4,While this is free jazz it's not a free-for-all,"While the late Frank Wright was one of the out-est of the free jazz saxophonists of the 1970s, this is a fairly accessible platter. This mos def has swing (sometimes abstractly, but it's there), drive, and unity (as an ensemble). While this is free playing, they play well as a unit, as opposed to four guys playing at the same time. Wright has that ecstatic quality that Coltrane had in his later period but with occasional touches of blues and R&B; (Wright was an R&B; bassist before he got the ""calling"").Perhaps not the best CD for novices but for those smitten, Wright is one of the somewhat less-known guys worth hearing!"
3,good read,well I like this book. I have always love stories of viking. Thou I hate the son of so and so stuff. but I have always hate it even as a child. this make me want to look more into Eric the red. It's must read. just for the history alone.
5,Cieli Di Toscana,"The music on this CD is a gift to the senses and to the soul. The dynamics of Andrea Bocelli's voice have developed and become more devastatingly beautiful than ever. He uses his incredible gift with sensational mobility and versatility to transform songs into masterful works of art.This music is different in many ways when compared to earlier releases. In ""Chiara"", his voice is more stirring and more sensual than ever. With ""Il Diavolo E L'Angelo"", he shifts into high gear with a new and intense vitality and rhythm that caught me (and my family) by complete surprise. He demonstrates unique power to reach from the softest tones into the loftiest notes.Before I received this CD as a gift, I wondered if Andrea Bocelli could really succeed in impressing me again as dramatically as he did with Romanza and Sogno. Now I know...and the answer has left me breathless and spellbound all over again."
5,You don't have to speak his language to know what's in his heart,Andrea Bocelle is one of those who sings from his heart. You can close your eyes and be swept away from any distress you might be having. His music is food for the soul. Thank you Andrea. I hope you sings for years to come.
5,Any small animal practitioner or library catering to vets and students will find this an essential reference,"Any small animal practitioner or library catering to vets and students will find this an essential reference to definitive radiographic anatomy of the dog and cat. From projections of plain radiographs to contrast studies, comparisons of images for diagnosis, and more, this updated edition packs in over 50 new figures, new guidance line drawings and tables, and quick reference contents by section. It's a solid reference any professional, college-level vet library needs: very highly recommended as a definitive, cornerstone reference.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,Met Rx,"Product is great for a quick breakfast, fills you up, tastes ok and is inexpensive considering how many breakfasts it covers."
4,Missing something,"A fairly good textbook, yet one thing almost vital to the subject: pictures. When describing some of the anatomical parts of insects, it becomes very easy to get jumbled up. A simple diagram could fix that. Overall, a good textbook."
5,Great for Milk Alergies,"These chocolate chunks are great for those who cannot have chocolate because of milk allergies. My daughter can now have chocolate chip cookies, smores, and just chocolate. She loves them!!! And I must say they are pretty good right out of the bag!!"
3,What's up with the change in case size?,I have purchased these chunks from Amazon for several years since most local groceries no longer carry the chunks. I've been happy with the price and service but I noticed they have halved the size of the case and it is nearly the price of a case of 12 a year ago. I'm not blaming Amazon for the change--I'm blaming the company for poor customer service. What used to cost around $28 is now over $40. Shame on you Baker's!
5,One of my all time favorites,"This is the kind of hauntingly beautiful story that stays with you, years after you read it. Urban fantasy of the classic kind -- human finds himself suddenly dealing with elves. If you haven't read it, you need to! When it comes to urban fantasy, only the Bedlam's Bard and SERRAted Edge series are in the same class."
4,Love it!,Can't go wrong with MZB. Never written a bad book and I've read most of them. Haven't finished this one yet but can't put it down.
2,Note So Good,"The book offers a quick read, but it is as if the author simply jotted down entries from his personal journal. He may be a specialist on the subject, but he offers no supportive data for his empirical evidence. I found his take on circumcision to be particularly problematic. He makes a brief argument for circumcision but offers no information on the studies he draws his conclusions from. Oh, and he also says that one should circumcise their boy so that he doesn't look different, thus implying that there is something offensive of the site of an uncircumcised penis.I wouldn't waste your money on this book."
3,"Okay, but not recommended.","This book is just okay. There is some good empirical information for you. The book is geared towards Great Britain, so a little strange for an American in some respects. There are a lot of either grammatical and/or spelling mistakes, possibly typos, which may be attributable to the differences between English and American English, I'm not sure. Either way, I found that aspect of this book a little annoying. It's not terrible, but I can't really recommend it."
3,How come I was singing along?,"If you ignore the title, this CD is an absolutely fabulous collection of instrumental music. However, I was disapointed that I was *singing* along to songs ""without words"". I feel that there are many other popular ""theme"" type songs that would have fit very well onto this album (and also don't have words!), but instead found everyone's favorite Robin Hood sap song. Nice try, but next time, hum a few bars and see if you remember the lyrics!"
3,I finally figured out where I've heard this before!,"I picked this one at the used cd store, and it proved to be a decent find. Nothing fabulous mind you, but a good one to throw in while you're cooking a nice dinner perhaps. Every time I listened to it, however, it nagged at me, ""Where have I heard this?""Well, I went to the doctor the other day, and was in the waiting room, and -you guessed it- this was playing. So if this helps you at all, it's doctor's office music, which some may consider to be one step above elevator music. Proceed with that in mind.Now I know why everytime I hear it I feel the need to shell out a ten dollar copay."
2,Compilation misses the mark,"Although most of the wordless songs on this disc aren't bad,they aren't especially great either.""A Hollywood Nocturne"" is perhaps the best thing here,with its evocation of neon lit late nights and the night owls who walk amongst them.Other than that there is mostly filler and miscellaneous fluff that you forget as soon as the songs are over.Windham Hill really didn't try too hard to come up with a great set, and it shows.Very disappointing."
2,big bag,"Im a Firefighter, High Mountain Rescue + EMT Instructor, bought it for the adds on internet, its just a big bag, needs more separation and ways to hold equipment, you have to buy smaller bags to fit inside the bag, equipment gets mixed if you try to put it inside with out been inside other small bag. looks sturdy. waiting for rain to see how it works. you can put a lot of equipment inside"
1,Too shallow to be of any real use,"The problem with this book is that it adresses too many points, providing little or no detail on each of them. All the book does is merely tell you there is something like Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis, etc., but it is too shallow to really learn something useful about all these fields.Personally, I ordered this book because I wanted to learn more about the inner workings and the behind-the-scenes aspect of the futures markets. However, despite the title, the book offers very little information about how the Futures markets actually work."
4,Upbeat performer!!,"I've seen Jim Gill several times at concerts at my children's preschool. He is very upbeat, and lively. He's also a little silly, but the kids love that. He sings silly songs that kids love to sing (Washing Machine), dance, and jump around to. He's kind of like Raffi, but silly (in a good way). :-)"
5,Great CD for Young Kids,"This is our second Jim Gill CD. We love it. Our favorite song is the Jumping and Counting song, but we like several others as well. This is a close second to ""The Sneezing Song"" one for us. We listen to both of these in the car, but also in the house, so we can move and jump along with the music sometimes too. Can't say enough good things about either the ""Irrational Anthem"" or ""The Sneezing Song."""
4,THUMP !,"I was really impressed with the sound quality in these headphones they deliver the thump in listening to todays bass sounds. Allthough they are a little bulky,warm on the ear and the battery pack is cumbersome.It is easy to forget to turn the battery off but battery last a long time.I purchaced these for my son and decided to get a pair for myself."
2,Dead in 4 Months!!!,"Worked well when it was working...massive bass response, comfortable cushioning for big ears and funky styling. Only complaint is the cumbersome battery case and cheap feeling plastic construction. However, none of this mattered when it just stopped working 4 months after purchase. Gave absolutely no signs before hand, just working one day, completely dead the next. There are other reviewers here that shared my same fate, so if you want to gamble with these, go ahead, but know that the risk is a pair of dead headphones."
3,"Excellent bass, but the overall tonal quality is disappointing",I'm very impressed with the bass response (that *is* this headphones' claim to fame) but the overall tonal quality isn't great. The midrange is kind of muddy and vocals sometimes sound over-emphasized. And the bass can give you a headache very quickly if it's cranked.
2,"Good Style, Mediocre Sound","These headphones and others made by the Skullcandy brand have a good sense of style, but my problem with these headphones was the sound quality. The built in ""subwoofer"" is a pretty fun feature, and it sounds pretty decent. The bad part is that the sound as a whole isn't very good, It seems like there is a lot of high to mid-high sound, and TONs of very low-end sound with the subwoofer on, but little or no true bass sound, which is very dissapointing. I could barely even hear the bassist on most rock songs I listened to, with or without the subwoofer on.Another major complaint I have is that the subwoofer in the right earpiece started to make rattling noises after I had the headphones for about two weeks and I had to send them to the manufacturer.Overall a decent headphone if you're not picky about sound quality, and you just want something that looks pretty cool. If you want something that delivers more in the sound department, get a pair of Sennheisers."
4,Great! :),"I'm not 'audiophile' but I know bad sounding headphones/speakers from good ones these are definitely great and well worth the money, got here faster than I expected and was neatly packaged. :) My only issue is the bass doesn't seem to kick on in certain songs at certain parts, minor con if you'd ask me since it always comes on during the important parts. Get these.Just a quick edit here, the people complaining about the sound probably don't know how to tweak their system to make it sound good and just expect it to sound EPIC on default audio settings. :) A problem many technologically impaired people face!"
4,OK for home use,"I use it on my computer since I live in an apartment and can't play loud music at night. So far, it's been pretty good. The sounds are clear and the bass amplifier works good. It does get a little uncomfortable when I use it for 2 hours or so but nothing major to complain about."
4,"Easy on the ears, hard on the ears","If you have smaller than average ears, go buy these headphones immediately. You won't be disappointed, particularly if you are a gamer. BUT, if you have average or larger ears, you will only be able to wear them for limited stints while gaming (20-30 minutes?) The padding is way to shallow, and causes significant discomfort to your ears. The sound quality itself is way better than you would expect for the price. I use mine regularly, but have to constantly shift their position to avoid colossal ear aches. Sad flaw for an otherwise superior product."
3,Eh,"The comfortability of the headphones are excellent, but the sound quality just sucks.The bass is muffled so it makes you sound like you have your head in a trashcan listening to a sub...If it was clearer and could handle faster music than I might actually like it, but it can't handle most music."
4,Skullcrushers,"WELL, My review isn't so happy..I only had the Skullcrushers for less than 6 months and they broke..The wire connecting to the Base amplifier volume and control got weak and snapped..BUT, THE SILVER LININGEven though they broke, Skullcandy Company is replacing them and they are extremely nice when you call them on the phone! So, if you're hard on headphones like I am (and don't mind shelling out 50ish dollars) these are a fantastic bargain.. I mean what other company lets you replace the headphones when they break and has a lifetime warranty for no extra cost?"
1,IMPORTANT READ THIS REVEIW!!!,"These are some great headphones, BUY THEM FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE! I chose to buy them here because of the lower price, big mistake, what I recieved wasen't the item picutered. I don't know if there an older version or some knock-offs, the sound is ok... but there very cheaply made and theres something wrong with the hinges they don't fold properly. I have an average size head and even fully extended to put them on you have to warp the headband to the point that it looks like its about to break. Returned them and spent the extra 20 bucks to buy them from the actual site."
1,"Two pairs, both broken.","I made the mistake of buying a second pair of these, when the first ones broke within 60 days. They sound really good for the price, so I thought it was worth the risk. Unfortunately the 2nd pair broke after about 30 days. There is no information on Skullcandy's website about warranty or repair policy. I tried to contact them via their online form and have gotten no response. I guess that I am a slow learner, but I have now learned not to buy from them."
2,defective,"I bought this at gander mountain for 79.00 and saved the shipping cost. However after I purchased it the door spring latch immediately broke. I called the manufacturer and was told it had a know defect and they would ship me a repair kit. If you have a product that is defective and you know it you should not keep selling it without informing the public or fixing the issue, especially when it is something like the failure of the door latch that could cause safety issues with people and the animal. You have a responsibility to inform people who purchase this product that it is defective."
4,Nice crate,"This is a nice lighter weight crate. For the money it is worth it. If you have an escape artist that really wants out, he might bend the door. My one Brittany did on a similar model two years ago. He pulled the door in on that one! This crate is solid but not heavy weight in my opinion. Assembly on this is extremely quick and easy."
4,Good value,"I purchased the 36in X 26in X 28in for my Chow mix and it was great. I loved the quick release screw system, the wrap around ventalation and the smooth door locking mechanism. So, it was a no brainer that when I needed a smaller size for our new small dog that I would purchase another Remington.The Remington 26in X 17in X 18in has the same quick release screw system and wrap around ventalation that the larger model has but the door locking mechanism is a pain in the butt. For some reason, the door always sticks. To get the top and bottom pins to seat in the holes, you have to lift up on the top piece of the kennel. It's not a big deal, but getting the dog in and out of the kennel at night, in the dark is noisy and frustrating.The medium Remington kennel (26X17X18) is still a well made kennel and a good value for the money but for some reason it just doesn't live up to it's bigger brother."
1,Hazardous to your dog's health,"We purchased this kennel last April for our 2YO Siberian Husky. Today it went into the trash. He had chewed at some of the plastic slats to the point where they were loose and he tried to get his snout through the opening, causing several cuts to his face. Yes, dogs will be dogs, but if you have an escape artist dog this kennel is not for you. I would also note that the manufacturer does not stand by this product."
4,A Kennel For a Rottweiller,"Hello, I would like to know if you have a kennel available for my Rottweiller.Remington Plastic Kennel, Extra Large, 40-Inch L by 27-Inch W by 30-Inch H, Beige/Green"
4,Good product,Not much different then smaller ones you can buy in local stores. Made of mid-grade plastic with a locking metal grate door. Easy to put together.
1,Returned,"We purchased this kennel and had to return it. The holes for the door did not align, so you couldn't close the door and lock it. Disappointed."
3,Creative and fun but false advertising,"I must say I enjoyed this movie a lot. The concept in pretty cool and the effects and fights are well done. I dont think Jackie Chan should be on the cover though. He has such a minor role it's not really fair to the leads. Dont get me wrong, he was good, but he just isn't the star. Some people might be sucked into getting the movie under false pretenses. They should still get it, but not for Chan. Charlene Choi & Gillian Chungon kick some serious butt. It's also a bit of a sweat hearted movie and not just mindless vamp-hacking for 2 hours. It's not the best movie I've ever seen but it's a heck of a lot of fun."
1,NOT a Jackie Chan Movie.,Jackie Chan is on the cover but he's only in two scenes. What a disappointment!
3,Buffy Times Two,"Note: Chinese with English subtitles.'The Twins Effect' is a suprisingly enjoyable film designed primarily to cash in on the popularity of the Asian pop singing duo ""Twins"" comprised of Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung. The two attractive young ladies fight their way through vampires, boyfriends and each other in high style with great special effects and fight sequences that won't disappoint.Directors Dante Lam and Donnie Yen surrounded the duo with an excellent cast which includes; Ekin Cheng, Edison Chen, Mickey Hardt and a brief but memorable cameo by Jackie Chan as himself."
4,Tongue (and fang) in cheek,"This was a truly fun movie. There are a few spots of sorrow, and, as typical with many Asian martial arts flicks, there's a lot of wire-work in the special effects. It might seem like there are also some plot holes, but I attribute it to the Oriental mindset, to how they view plot development as opposed to a Westerner...what we see as plot holes, they just don't see as relevant to the plot.My wife and I laughed til we cried in some spots, and you will too as long as you remember to not take it as an attempt at a serious movie...after all, Jackie Chan is in it.As a bonus, the out-takes at the end has a riotously funny segment on the perils of vampiric impotence..."
4,Teaching What Cannot Be Taught,"This is a collection of talks about the Sandokai, an ancient Chinese poem that is regularly chanted in Zen circles. The poem itself is quite obscure when you first read it and the talks are similarly obscure at first. The rational mind finds it difficult to understand how you can, to take one of his examples, kill earwigs without violating the Buddhist precept against killing. Shunryu Suzuki uses such examples to try to help us move past our usual dualistic thinking.And, somehow, it works. By the end of the book when the poem is repeated in Suzuki's translation, it makes sense. He has successfully lead us into a place of darkness, that is a place beyond intellectual understanding.A book to be read slowly, in small doses, and to be contemplated, rather than analyzed and thought about."
5,great book,I'm just so happy to see Mary R. Cabot's book reprinted in SOME form. For so long the book has only been available at the library and I'm tickled pink.
4,Best of 1999,"This is a great CD that showcases the best music of '99. I wanted to buy half of these artists full CD until I saw this CD. It has something for everyone Pop, Rap. R&B, Dance etc. The standout tracks are Smooth by Santana, Nobody's Suppose To Be Here by Deborah Cox, Angel of Mine by Monica, and This Kiss By Faith Hill. It also has great hits by NSYNC, Cher, TLC, and Third Eye Blind. It's like listening to your favorite radio station for over an hour and loving each song that comes on, and that rarely happens. The only thing I did not like was the final song Bawatiba or whatever you call it, by Kid Rock."
4,One of the best...,"This CD/Tape has great quality. The songs are hit songs from 1998-99. The music is great. I bought the tape version of this and it sounds great, just imagine the CD!"
2,not happy,The cd had scratches on it and also skipped on two songs when I recieved it.Did not know how to how to complain for $3 I let it pass. Tom
4,"Very, Very Good!","I think that this CD is very good. It is definetly one of the best CDs I have ever bought. Most of the songs are really good, but I gave this CD only four stars because not all are. Some of the songs that don't appeal to me are ""Bawitdaba"" and ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here"" only because I just don't like the style of music, but there are many that I do like. For example, the dance tunes ""No Scrubs"" or ""One Week"" and the slow tunes like ""(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time On You"" or ""Angel of Mine"". And there are songs that are just plain good like ""Smooth"" and ""Someday""! Buy it, it totally is worth it. This album has totally good hits!"
4,A Stable Collection Of Hits!,"The first Totally Hits features a lot of top hits from superstar artists. I think is as good if not better than Now 3. TLC has the first track and they deserve it. No Scrubs was a huge, mega hit! That song is more popular than their record-breaking album! I also liked the slow Angel of Mine. This is Monica's best song and it is my second favorite song on this cd! Sugar Ray's Someday was a hit that doeen't make any since. It is slow and they sound like they're bored. Other bad tracks are Kid Rock's Bawitawba(I don't think I spelled that write),Santana's Smooth,NSYNC's A Little More Time On You, and 5ive's song. But I do like Cher,Whitney Houston,Madonna,Brandy,Usher,Deborah Cox,Faith Hill,and Barenaked Ladies. If you like R&B,slow pop,and little bit of rock you will love this cd."
4,Awesome series,I read these back in 94 (i was 13 at the time) probably should not have been reading that type of book but i loved to read and they were available to me via a book club i was signed up with. I can vaguely remember every thing that happened but i know that i enjoyed a good read and Tyler was exactly that. I searched and searched for these books an now i have found them and will re-read them again!
3,"Whirlwind (Tyler, Book 1)","Well, what can I say? It was a romance, a mystery, and just the slightest bit odd. I found it highly unbelievable that someone could seclude themself for so long that they were afraid to be around people, because they might ""hurt"" them. Then again, I know nothing about what Cliff went through, so I can't really say what's believable.Either way, it was what I would consider a typical romance, and it promises a sequal because of it's open ending. Even though, chances are that nobody else will read these books. They are not exactly what I consider popular, if I'm the sixth reviewer in fifteen years of publication. But, if someone happens to come across it, I will tell you one thing. This book is forgettable, and I will most likely forget everything that happens one or two books later."
2,Frustrating,"I recently purchased an infrared door, and had to deal with getting two of these keys ready for my cats. For some unknown reason, the metal ring that came with both of mine to attach the key to the cat's collar wasn't already attached to the key itself, and it DOESN'T fit the tiny opening on the key. I had to hunt down a smaller key ring for the first key and chop off part with wire cutters to even get it to fit, and I'm sitting here staring at the second key and a gimp metal ring that won't work with it so I have no idea how I'm going to actually attach this to the cat's collar.Also, I was confused to see that there was a $10 difference between this key on Amazon and the yellow key; who knows why blue was deemed such a valuable color that it requires a $10 difference."
3,Good,It's a good basic overview of bodily trauma and what kind of injuries to be considered but not something I'd recommend for those who want a deeper look into the subject or a understanding of how a specific injury will affect the body.
3,"Great picture, baaad sound!","Bought this TV for my cabin crusier. Love the picture and compactness and light weight of the TV. the remote is a little cumbersome, but the worst are the speakers. Trust me folks, this TV has a worse sound than a $5 AM radio. Speakers and volume control are abysmally bad. I only recommend if you can supplement with a stereo or external speakers."
2,Poor sound quality negates otherwise fine lcd tv,"I purchased this on impulse without researching brands when I was shopping for a small tv. The sleek design appealed to me and thought it would be handy to have the option of a second computer monitor. However since I'm using it primarily as a tv, the tin sounding speakers ruin it for me. A very poor performer unless it will be used purely as a monitor."
2,Poor sound hard to adjust,Out of the box months ago and still can't get it adjusted. From 12 feet away the sound is tinny and acceptable only if the bass is turned way up and the treble is turned way down. The picture is not crisp and the background is too black. If I adjust it brighter everything turns washed out. I expected more. I use it with ear phones and over a treadmill so it is acceptable for the price.
3,easy to use,"The monitor part is perfect (great picture) easy to use, great size. For me dvd & tv are alittle out of focus. Some people may not notice. If you back up a bit it looks better. I'd recomend trying this tv out. Also- its ""dc"" 12volt so you can use it in a motor home."
1,Terrible Product,"I bought this product a year ago, and a few months after I bought it I would have intermittent problems with the TV video - it would flash to a garbled screen with vertical and horizontal patchwork lines. I never sent it back because every time I was about to the problem would go away. Now the problem seems to be permanent. The problem only happens with TV and S-video, not the computer VGA input.Also, changing channels is annoying because there's a 2 second pause between channels. Very annoying.Don't bother with Magnavox. I've never had a reliable product from either Philips or Magnavox."
4,Nothing wrong with it.,Nothing wrong with the dish. It was shipped fast and wasn't broken. No complaints.
3,Poorly Covered Butter Dish,"I recently bought this beautiful Sophie Conran covered butter dish for myself. I was very dissappointed because although it is beautiful the cover does not have a rim to rest on so the cover does not fit properly. The cover rattles on the dish, appears to be warped and is easy to fall off of the dish. Also, I wanted a covered butter dish to protect my butter from picking up odors in the refridgerator. I also didn't want specks, cooking stuff like flour or pepper to get onto my butter. I would not buy this again if I had known how it was made."
2,Works but overpriced for the quality,"My goal when selecting this dish was to reduce the butter mess which always got all over our traditional dish and cover. It did help that but didn't eliminate it (has more to do with the users than the dish!). It looks nice but the lid is poorly made. It is misshapen so doesn't fit very well at best, and when rotated around the other way fits quite poorly. This isn't a big deal, it does work, but should be better made for the price."
2,Absolutely Preposterous!,"The point of purchasing a 'covered' butter dish is to 'cover' the butter - UTILITY! The extremely flimsy lid merely sits, precariously, on top of the pot; and only if turned in 1 direction. I was not expecting an airtight seal, but, the lid does not even lie edge-to-edge. There is plenty of room for the contaminating fridge air to funnel in - the butter turns in color & taste, poste haste! The design is so inherently flawed that one must 'hold' the lid in place when moving the pot, even slightly, else the lid will just slide/fly right off.I mentioned the flimsiness of the lid. Please understand, if the edge so much as taps the counter (or, anything not soft), BAM it will break like shale. The same goes for the top edges of the pot. Again, the flawed design: the edges are tapered to near paper thinness.If looking for utility, avoid the headache here!"
4,NIce dish,Only thing would be the lid fitting better but I am guessing it may be due to being handmade. Still nice cuz it holds two sticks of butter.
3,Gallois is an extraordinaire virtuoso !,"This music is absolutely superb !! I did not know Gallois before. He is a great virtuoso. This music of C.P.E. is astonishing. A great discovery for me. But, of course, you have to love flute. This beautiful and rhythmic music is never agressive for the listener. And you'll have two CDs at a bargain price. I had some doubt about NAXOS recording. It has been confirmed after listening to this CdS on all of my CD players. The sound of the flute is very clear. But we can't heared the orchestra with clarity. The sound of orchestra, the strings in particular, is so unclear and bad that it's ruined most of the pleasure. NAXOS does it again !!! Poor label. Personnally, this is my last purchase of a NAXOS CD.On the whole, I give 5 stars for the performance of Patrice Gallois and 1 star for the NAXOS recording."
2,Not Sure of value,The product was interesting and i have been using Prima Force CLA for some time so i thought i'd give it a try. I'm not sure i got any benefit from this product.
2,Dissapointed,"I have been using the Kids and Pets liquid products for years, so I was happy to see they had an aerosol product out. But once I got the product I was dissapointed. The smell isn't the same and it does not work near as well as the liquid. I love the product but would recommend you purchase the liquid instead of the aerosol."
2,Don't waste your money,"Kids 'N Pets put out some awesome products. This is not one of those. Whether it's on rugs or carpet, I get better results using the regular Kids 'N Pets than this aerosol atrocity. The can sprays well, but that doesn't mean anything if the solution you are spraying actually get messes out of your carpets. Save your money and buy what works - it's not this product!"
4,Oldies are Awesome,"I enjoyed the variety of the music on this compilation. There's slow, and fast alike. If you enjoy the groove of oldies, then you'll enjoy this album, with music that's so easy to dance to."
1,WOW! WHAT A TRASHY HEROINE!!!!,"As usual, but even worse this time, PM writes about a pretty good story with trashy characters , especially the heroine Maggie. The men are tall, strong, hard working, weak minded nothings who sexually want Maggie anyplace, anytime, under any circumstances - even rape, and she loves or excepts it all.Nothing else about the book is worth mentioning. A poor read unless you are immorally sick. I don't know how books like this get published as a romance.And this lady has written sixteen best sellers in a row? Doesn't say much about the American readers (who are mostly women)does it?"
4,Good advice,"Grandmaster Davies is one of Britain's better Chess players and teachers and it shows in his writing. It's eminently readable, simple and clear. The advice given is filled with common sense and the reader should be able to utilise them without too much trouble. A slight drawback is the fact that there isn't that much new or original material (hence the four instead of five starts)."
5,An excellent book,"This book is exactly what I've needed. I'm at the point where I want to play some tournament chess (despite my mediocre ability) and I fortunately came across this book. Nigel Davies offers some sound and practical advice, and does so in a highly readable and down-to-earth manner. In particular I found his advice on building an opening repertoir useful; common sense when you think of it, but for many budding chess players, the whole notion of learning all of the openings has them frantically trying to memorize every conceivable line. Unrealistic and unnecessary, to say the least. Anyway, before I launch into a total summary of the book, I'll just close by recommending this book to any novice who wants to start playing in tournaments."
4,Seems entirely adequate for the task,"This gel worked fine with my therapeutic home ultrasound machine on my sore muscles. When it dries it doesn't seem to leave a ""slimy"" residue feeling which is good. It has a small and barely noticeable smell.Despite the product seeming entirely adequate for the task, I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because there is no indication on this online product description or on the product itself of the constituent ingredients. It *seems* good, but for a product I use often, I would like to check the ingredients list myself."
4,Religion,"This is a very step by step book. I found the first half helpful, but it is probably more attuned to someone who is dealing directly with addiction or is working with a person attempting withdrawal or recovery from addiction."
5,Excellent book,"excellent book, well written, scripturally accurate, without any of the sensationalism that often accompanies this topic"
5,Get free,"Evil is real, and it plays a role in all of our lives. We all have chains from our family lives, our wrongdoing, and other influences that can have a lasting negative effect. This book presents an approved path to ridding your life of these things and keeping them gone. This has had a great effect on my life."
5,Excellent Book! Highly recommended!,This is one of the most balanced books on this subject I have ever read! I love this book. Every person who is wanting to pray with others should read this simple yet profoundly helpful book. Full of real life scenarios and stories to help clarify and instruct. This book should be in every counselor's or prayer ministry person's library.
1,Galante is not all that,"I was very disappointed in this CD, especially after reading two 5 star reviews. The musical selections are great, but Galante's vocal tone is very inconsistent. Not only did it sound as if she was singing in an echo chamber, her singing fluctuated between the back of her throat and her nose. If you are looking for a CD to demonstrate good vocal technique, look elsewhere."
4,An old fashioned swashbuckling adventure,"This book is just plain fun. There are no deep issues here, other than the love story, just an adventure that sweeps you along for 150 pages. The main character is stranded on a foreign planet with no technology and when a space ship arrives he sees his ticket back to civilization. The story that follows is filled with ships that ""sail"" on grass instead of water, cannibals, pirates, moving islands, and, of course, a love interest. Put simply, the book is just a lot of fun.Unfortunately, the book is out-of-print. But if you're willing to find an old copy somewhere, it's worth the hunt."
4,GREEN ODYSSEY is a highly entertaining novel,"A Good SF novel about sailing over verdant alien plains with windrollers, giant vessels with wheels. A grand adventure."
4,dog grooming,This book has been very helpful for the beginner. It has alot of very useful tips and is the perfect tool to get you started in the dog grooming business.
4,Dog Book,"Well written and informative.Fairly good on the ""how to"" subject and very good on general dog subjects such as dog health,dog maladies and the basics."
5,Great book for the novice or professional,I am teaching myself to groom dogs and find this book to be the biggest help available!
2,NOT DETAILED ENOUGH,"THE BOOK WAS NOT DETAIL ENOUGH ON SPECIFIC BREEDS-I HAVE A COCKER AND THEY JUST SAID SHOULD BE TREATED SAMED AS INSTRUCTIONS FOR LONG HAIRED DOGS. I WAS HOPING FOR MORE DETAILED GROOMING BY BREED, LIKE WHAT NUMBER BLADE TO USE ON EACH PART OF BODY AND MORE ILLUSTRATION OF INSTRUCTIONS.I WAS DISAPPOINTED- THIS WAS THE FIRST ""FOR DUMMIES"" BOOK I HAVE PURCHASED THAT I WAS NOT REALLY HAPPY WITH."
5,Dog Grooming for Dummies,"I just received my Dog Grooming for Dummies and really, really love it. I am high lighting things I want to find instantly. I am interested in grooming only my cocker spaniel and have found the book most helpful for me.I will say I have other ""Dummie' books and have learned something from all of them. Have never scratched my head and wondered why I bought a particular book.I think my Grooming book has been the best. I am sure it is partly to do with spending more time with my furry friend and enjoying the time. When I took him to a professional groomer, I was a basket case before they called that he was ready. Now, I don't have to worry about that. True, he doesn't look like he's been to a professional groomer, but maybe we will get there someday. If not we have had lots of time and fun bonding. Love the book, everyone should own this one."
2,Dog Grooming for Dummies,"This book is full of useful information, but unfortunately it is lacking in illustrations or photos that would help the ""Dummies"" learn from scratch how to bathe, clip, and otherwise groom their dogs. This is too visual/hands on a process to be simply described in words."
2,More like Dog Bathing For Dummies,"This book was a disappointment: was not about grooming your pet to a certain cut, or which parts to do first, blade differences for paws and ears, but more about how to get your dog into a tub or be brushed. Some nice tips on getting nasty things out of fur, but anything more than that, the book seems to recommend going to ask your local pet groomer to teach you. Not helpful for folks looking to undertake seriously grooming their pet. I did try the Everything Dog Grooming book, which was much more helpful."
4,Dog Grooming For Dummies (For Dummies (Pets)),"This was purchased just in time to supplement the adult Ed. Intro to Pet (dog) Grooming classes (10 hours) at the local JVS.The class is strictly an INTRO to dog grooming, BUT, was disappointed that instructor/school for our $150 fee did NOT give us an actual book on the subject. We got some printed copies of pages from insructor's book...DOG GROOMING for DUMMIES is a GREAT source for home groomer want-to-be's.I think it is well written and not at all boring.I am glad I got it for I have 2 new pups and two older dogs, and, I I have found out, I can do a LOT more for both me and the dogs' benefit."
3,Not breed specific for specific grooming.,When I purchased this item I was hoping for more than I got. It is not breed specific for specific grooming. It is all in general terms and I was looking for more specific tips in grooming. Worth the money if you are looking for general tips in grooming.
4,Encouraging for newbies,"Prior to now, I've always had dogs that required only an occasional bath and a brush, but I have a new little one that requires serious maintenance. She's TERRIFIED of anyone else (long story), so I wanted to learn how to groom her at home with less stress for us both. This book has helped us work through some issues -- we're still not perfect, but it's a practical book with real information and helpful tips to give ME the courage to get out those shears and that shampoo and get busy. I recommend it for beginners.Dog Grooming For Dummies (For Dummies (Pets))"
2,Not what I expected,"I wanted to have some instruction on how to trim the coat of dogs.This reviews the bathing etc. but not the acutal trimming and safety when trimming.I don't recommend this book, it is too basic."
2,Good book,Delivery was prompt. Book was more worn than expected but still good. I would buy from this seller again.
4,That's The Way It Was,"I'll be honest and admit that this CD was an incredible surprise. Because the recordings would have been made in 1955-56, I expected the sound quality to be bearable at best (similar to the ""Beatles at the Star Club - 1962"" recordings). Instead, the audio is quite good, as are the musical performances, audience response, and Elvis' banter between songs. I can't say that I was there at the time, but if any CD captures the revolution that Elvis helped set in motion in the mid 1950's, this must be it."
1,"Poorly designed product. It works, but.......","it is not easy to put into the ground. The problem is that the spike portion, which is located below the pass-through head, should have been made at a right angle and not parallel with the head. This poor design makes it difficult to place one's feet on the pegs. Try again, Gilmour."
4,Good resource,"This is an excellent book. The coverage of SQL Server is very solid. However, if you plan to purchase the author's newest book, SQL Server 2000 for Experienced DBAs, DO NOT purchase this book. The newer book covers everything this book covers, in addition to the topic of high availability. Owning both books would be completly redundant, a mistake I personally made."
5,a MUST book,"Normally, I don't buy books from Osborne. But this book blew me away with its tips. This book can save you hundreds of hours in SQL server downtime, and amaze your own DBA colleagues with tips and tricks that are largely undocumented. I won 8 books on SQL servers and this has been one of two books reference whenever there is a problem. Buy it, try it, and you won't regret it."
5,Great Advanced Book With Practical Advice,"I've been looking for a long time for a good admin book. I hate buying an entire book just to only have one paragraph on text I didn't know already. This book is filled with best practices and is to the point. It already assumes that you know how to create a database and all the basics and starts at a more practical level. Without a doubt, this is a buy!"
3,actually I give it a 3.5,"Cheese at its fines. Wu Ma truly puts together a classic. It's not like he is a great director cause he's pretty bad, but this just shows what Godfrey Ho could have done if he spent more than 1 day on his movies. If you wanna see Dean Shek play a badass then watch this movie. Shek doen's look to badass but he almost does. Overall I have to say I love this movie, and the version I have is pretty bad quality so I can't imagine this being any worse. (...)"
3,Classic kung fu movie,"Movie was great, however it is old and therefore quality is a bit scratchy. If you are a fan of old school kung fu movies you should enjoy this one"
5,"Great book for first time (or 2nd, 3rd...) parents!","This book is great! Gives you ideas for games to play with your child to advance their development, suggests milestones that are typical for your child's age (in weeks or months), also offers advice for what to do in minor medical situations (ie colds, fever, teething, etc). I have recommended this book to several people already. I plan to read it again with our next child to brush up on ideas and such. The layout of the book is super easy to follow and is a quick read from week to week. Love it!"
2,I should have listened to the reviews,The chapters are repetitive and the timing is all off. It just leaves me feeling depressed because my son is not hitting any of the milestones due to their ridiculous timing.
5,good activities for baby,"I thought this book was very helpful. I am the youngest in my family and the first to have a baby, I had ZERO experience with babies/kids. I thought this book was great as it helped me to know what types of activities I could do with my baby at an appropriate time. I also found all of the development information to be very helpful and interesting."
1,This one's gotta go back to the store,"I bought this book because, for the most part, I am enjoying ""Your Pregnancy Week by Week"". I'm due in October 2002 and wanted something to prepare me for what to expect the first few weeks. Well, I haven't even gotten past reading the first week, and I have to take this back to the store PRONTO.Although I am having a girl, I have read up on circumcision for boys and consider myself pretty knowledgeable about what care would be needed for an uncircumcized baby. This book states that you should gently retract the foreskin and wash with soap and water. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! An uncircumcized penis needs little care other than gentle cleaning and the foreskin should NEVER be retracted at this early age!I'm sorry, but I can't take the rest of this book seriously after reading misinformation in the first few pages."
1,TOO MANY ERRORS,The author can't even get his months and weeks straight (ex: he calls a 28-week-old a 7-month-old.. but a 28-week-old is only 6 months old).. and if hasn't figured out yet that a month is longer than 4 weeks (unless it is february)... you shouldn't be trusting him to give you advice on your infant. Also.. remember the author is an obgyn.. not a pediatrician... and obviously not a mathematician either.
1,Not helpful,"My son is 14 weeks old, and I decided today that I'm done with this book. My complaints are the same as the other one-starrers: I realize that all babies are different, and some milestones will be reached early or late, but my son is consistently behind every week. This makes me worry unnecessarily and causes stress I don't need.Most chapters also contain filler that I can't use at all. For example, in-depth discussions of child care pop up in ""Week 4"" but I live in California and I'm not returning to work until my son is 16 weeks. Information on immunizations doesn't show up until ""Week 9"". Um, we'd already been through 2 rounds of shots by then, thanks.I can see myself paging back and forth, trying to find information, and the index for this book is no great shakes.I don't like it. It seems to be written for a very different baby than mine. If you look it over, I bet you'll feel the same way."
3,Not always the most proper information,"I was very disappointed to see this book take such a neutral position on male infant circumcision. The book, which has as its goal the intention of giving the best medical advice, does not inform readers that male circumcision is not recommended by any medical association in the United States or abroad. Are the writers really doing their best to give the best medical advice to new parents? I don't think so!!The weight categories also did not correlate whatsoever with my child's development."
1,Do not use as a reference,"I threw this book in the trash today. Every baby is different and this book really pushes the boundaries of where a child should be developmentally. Walking (or cruising as they call it) at 9 months? I don't think so. Not for my baby, and I am fine with that. If I relied on this book as a guideline for where my son should be I would be a stress case."
1,I don't normally burn books but I will make n exception for this one.,"I am too busy to go way in detail but, this book has the absolute worst breastfeeding advice I have read. It doesn't even give the AAP's full statement on breastfeeding. Blah, this book really sucked!"
2,Fair Read,"This book is a good tool for just a simple guideline on development but it's not very up to date on some of the more ""controversal"" issues. If you plan to breastfeed or co-sleep, this book doesn't favour either. It also seems to favour commercial baby food and other products over making your own. It also doesn't discuss alternative ways to immunize children that might be less harmful for them."
2,Out of date,"While there are parts of this book I enjoyed, there were many more frustrating aspects to it. The milestones seem to be consistently REALLY early. In a group of 20 babies, frequently only 1 or 2 have hit any of the milestones in the given time frame. In addition all of the feeding information is contrary to what my pediatrician has given (when and how to start solids, when to wean -- 4 months?). What to Expect was much more useful."
1,If only I could give it zero,"I read this book with my first child back in 2004. I don't think I really looked at it again once she arrived. When we had our second child 4 months ago, I pulled it out. Much to my dismay there is so much wrong info that I just never saw until I had BTDT. The mention of weaning from breast milk to formula at 4 months boggles the mind, especially since the AAP say breast feed until at least one year and the WHO says two. The AAP also do not start solids before 6 months. THe milestones are totally off and the weeks months don't match.As a second time mom, I say don't waste you time with this - Get the Sears book instead."
1,Incorrect and HARMFUL!,"Shocking how a book like that makes it on the market. Some of the information (like care of the uncircumsized baby) is so wrong, it is harmful to your baby's health to follow it.Don't buy this book. The info is out-dated and incorrect."
1,"Not just a horrible book, Also Dangerous!",I wish I could give this book a 0 star rating! The information is severely out dated. I was mortified when I read about the way the authors suggest caring for an intact (Uncircumcised) infant! If you were to follow the recommendations of this book you could cause permanent damage to your child. These people are Doctors?!?!
5,I like this book a lot,"I wonder if some of the people who have criticized this bookactually own or have read it?? I have it and refer to it everyweek. I have found it quite accurate (more than ""what to expect"") for what my baby is doing at a given age. There is also a disclaimer that every baby is different and develops at his/her own pace, so again I do not understand the criticism.The information re: feeding and diapering is constantly givenfor both breast/bottle and cloth/disposable. I really liketo see what my baby should be doing/eating/sleeping/playingeach week and like the confirmation I get from this book asmy 5 month old daughter is consistantly displaying the behaviordiscussed. Ignore the criticism, this is a great book for gifts, first time parents, and for anyone who wonders how whattheir child is doing compares to ""norms""."
1,Scottish Mum,"I have numerous frustrations with this book from the silly (calling an 18 wk baby 5 months) to the dangerous - saying to give a 20 week old baby a cracker to ""play with"", and while they do comment that they will ""probably not eat it"" it sounds like a serious choking issue for a baby that may just have started the simplest solids. I found having to flip back and forwards to different sections really annoying e.g. pets and baby, mentioned for first time in wk 2 but have to flip to week 12 to read about introducing baby to pets when you first come home from hospital! My husband bought this book and I can honestly say having read as much of it as I have (up to week 22) I would never recommend this book to anyone. I do however LOVE Baby 411."
2,Needs some serious editing,"I agree with several of the previous posts--this book contains SOME good information, but most of it is erroneous and poorly written. The weeks and months don't match up, and dozens of ""developmental milestones"" are downright wrong. I have training in developmental psychology and I worry that parents are going to take this book as gospel truth. In actuality, most of their developmental milestones are very advanced for what real babies are supposed to be doing.Use this book with caution!!!"
3,An Interesting and Somewhat Helpful Book,"Your Baby's First Year Week by Week is an informative book that describes an average baby's growth and milestone development week by week. The most useful sections for me were the Toys to Play With Baby for each week, and the guides for what baby should be eating at various ages after solid foods were introduced.I enjoyed reading what the average baby was doing each week, but I honestly found that both of my babies weren't quite in sync with the book's descriptions.I personally prefer What to Expect the First Year over this book. I feel that the First Aid section and information regarding illnesses in babies is better in that book."
4,Great Book,"I loved this book! I was very disappointed to read all the bad reviews about this book. Both my husband and I read this book weekly and found it very informative. The only major difference I found in this book was weight and length at the beginning of each week was very different from my daughers actual size. But in week 1 this book states its growth changes are based on a baby weighing 7 pounds and 20 inches long at birth. My daughter was almost 9 pounds and 22.5 inches long at birth! If you can get past the fact that your babys weight and lengh might be different than what the book states this book is a must! It has a lot of great information on health, development and lots of ideas to help your baby learn through playing."
4,Good all around book,"I thought this book was a very nice book to have to use as a reference & also just for fun. It states clearly in the book that your baby may be doing things sooner or later than the weeks that it talks about it in the book. However, it is still nice to have a bit of a reference. Especially for first time parents.I've really enjoyed the book personally."
4,Good Price,"I purchased this book for our daughter who is about to give birth to our first grandchild. I haven't looked at it but I had been told by others that it is a good book. For more information, ask my daughter in about a year. LOL."
5,Best Baby Book!,"This book is a great reference tool for any new parent. With week by week insights into how your baby is developing, and what to expect along the way, it's the best book I've found."
4,An Informative book,A word of warning. If you're looking for a well laid out book this one isn't. But it does contain a lot of information. The week by week breakdowns are good. Don't get hung up on the weight for the week or the height. Remember every child is different and unique. Some people get hung up on some of the medical info. Remember always get 3 opinions when it comes to medical advice. As for the developmental items it's great because it gives you a rough idea on when it's coming or should have came.
5,This is the best baby book,"As a first time mom who nurses,I find this book extremely helpful. Ireceived many other books from friends, but all had very clearagendas and gave contradictory advice. I got more stressedtrying to reconcile the advise found in ""Babywise"" with ""The Natural Baby"", which claimed the other methods would makemy baby obese or fail to thrive! I finally put boththose away and use this one only. This book does notpreach one method over another and gives a good reference forwhat to expect from your baby and when. Every few weeks,my husband and I look through it and see what we shouldlook for, what we should change in the baby's room (ie. when toremove the mobile hanging over the crib), and how toencourage growth and development. There also are helpfultips throughout the book (ie. when to call the doctor, how tomake your house safe for the baby once he startsto move around, etc.) For now on, I will get thisbook for my friends when they are expecting."
4,Useful Guide for parent,I thought this book was very handy and it gave you an idea of where you child is as far as his or her development. It gives suggestions on assisting with their development and is also an easy and organzized read.
2,Condition was not as described,"This was a bargain book that indicated it may have a ""small mark from the publisher or an Amazon price sticker."" The price sticker was there and that was fine. However, the cover has a long carpet-knife mark all the way down one side, the front and back covers are bent and have small tears. the binding is loose toward the end of the book. There was a stain that, luckily, I was able to wash off. This book was a gift for a young, new mother and I didn't have time to return. I will know better next time. GR"
1,Outdated,"I think too much of the information in this book is outdated and some of it dangerous. I recommend finding a different book, I did."
1,No Good,"I purchased the ""week by week"" during my pregnancy and enjoyed the book, however, the ""week by week"" of the first year is no good. I have an eight week old and do not feel that the descriptions are very realistic. In addition, I do not feel that the information is very helpful. This book is not a good resource."
4,Great first book!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a little more clear and to the point then some of the other books that are similar in topic. I thought I would continue with each book that followed, and was greatly disappointed. Stick with the first one!"
1,This is the WORST book full of WRONG and TERRIBLE advice!!!,"I bought this book because I enjoyed the Pregnancy week by week book. If I wasn't a mother who did research on my baby's development and just read this book, both myself and my baby would be in trouble. This book recommends weaning from breastmilk at 16 weeks (The AAP recommends 1 year), feeding your baby juice(Only if you want to encourage bad habits and cavities), allowing your baby to CIO (which has been proven by developmental psychiatrists to be BAD for babies!) feeding your baby fruit first and not veggies - this book is terrible. I don't see where an OB even has the right to write a book on baby development! These authors should be ashamed of themselves for even publishing this rubbish! Get The Baby Book by Sears instead. This was a BIG waste of [amt]. I would have rather thrown it out the window."
2,There are better books out there.,"If you're using this book as your only reference on baby care, you'd find yourself relatively uninformed on several important topics. For example: Breastfeeding is covered in a very cursory way. No pictures, no descriptions of techniques, only a half-hearted endorsement. The rest of the section sounds like it was written by baby formula manufacturers. In general, it was not a very well written book."
5,Amazing how exact,Incredible how precise this book was with our son. He would do almost exactly to the week what the book said. So it was fun to see what came next. This book was on our coffee table for a year and looked well used after that!
5,a genious,"When i have discovered the music of David Arkenstone i feel like reborn again,just like if someone turn my desire to voyage with my mind in another dimension.Thank you David from the bootom of my heart."
2,A song here and a song there...,"I had an opportunity to listen to this album in its entirety through Napster, and it's one of the reasons I am grateful for such a service. Indeed, there are some songs on it that are worth listening and owning (""In The Ancient Time"" is a nice choral work, for instance, and ""Cailleachs Whisper"" I could enjoy too), but the majority of them really don't help the album much. Some have a nice beginning, but end up yielding a cheap celtic sound, that comes accross like an imitation.There are far more interesting albums and artists to explore if you're into this genre. Lorenna McKennit reigns supreme. You got Clannad as well (specially old Clannad), Enya (who came from Clannad), and a number of Windham Hill acts, Nightnoise among them. Then, of course, you got Sinead O'Connor. I guess my point is, if you want Irish, shoot for the best. Don't settle for less than that."
5,Completely Captures the Imagination,"I started listening to this recording around the same time that I was reading ""Angela's Ashes"", which was serendipitous. I thought ""Book of Days"" would make a great soundtrack for the movie version of Frank McCourt's terrific memoir. I imagined it opening w/ ""Equos Fair"", and ""The Festival"" would feature in Frank's dance lessons. This has got to be one of David Arkenstone's best, and they're all good. The music is remarkably evocative; one hardly needs to close their eyes to be transported. But it's very melodic as well, as opposed to a one-dimensional space cadet ambience. Arkenstone's a tremendous talent, and I'm surprised his promoters haven't cast a wider net. If his albums were more aggressively marketed, they would sell a gazillion copies."
3,MADCATZ Universal Game Cable,"My kids have a Nintendo 64, GameCube and PlayStation 2. This cable cannot connect to both of the Nintendo devices at the same time. The length of the connectors is not long enough and makes it very tight to connect multiple devices. Otherwise okay for the price."
2,Only one console at a time...,"If you hook up more than one console at a time, you will only get sound on one of them. I don't find this all too useful for my Wii/360/PS2 setup, but I guess it could be a back up. I guess I'm a bit disappointed because I was expecting to clean up the tangled mess behind my TV. The quality of the video and audio isn't bad but its not better than the standard a/v cable that comes with each console."
1,Complete waste of money,"This book must have been written in 10 minutes. Many difficult topics are covered with one sentence explanantions, making the book worthless. I read the whole book in 15 minutes, in a room where I believe this book was written."
1,Fell apart within a year,"I used this sprayer for weeds. It has only been used 10 times and I have to throw it away. The valve broke after 4 uses and was replaced by the manufacturer. Now, the pump is broken rendering the unit unusable. It is really a piece of junk - not well constructed. I had to purchase two hose clamps early in it's life to keep the hose on during use. The manufacturer did not even think of suppling these hose clamps. We have a Chapin sprayer used for many years. We will replace this one with another Chapin."
5,Bugmeister,"It's very hard to find a one gallon sprayer that is stainless steel. I don't need more than a gallon at a time, so this one works out perfect. I do need an extension on the wand. The wands are always too short!"
3,Hudson 1 gallon sprayer,lightweight & flimsy. The plastic hose is stiff and the plastic trigger valve leaks terribly.Hudson 67215 Bugwiser Stainless Steel 1 Gallon Sprayer
1,Does not support Choral Music or Vocal Ensembles,"This company does not support Choral Music. Do not let the fact that they sell microphones and subscriptions to vocal ensembles mislead you. They do not have ANY choral music available to practice and have no plans to do so. This discrimination disappoints me. I cannot support a company that promotes discrimination.This company also makes Finale. After discovering their attitude towards Vocal Ensembles, I am making plans to switch from Finale to Sibelius. If you are a Choral Director, you should too. If you are a Band or Orchestra Director, it would be helpful if you pressured the company not to continue this discrimination."
3,unusual World War II story,"A first person account written by a British officer captured in combat in North Africa by Rommel's Africa Korps. Millar's well written story captures the feeling and experiences of being a German & Italian POW, and escaping across Nazi occupied Europe. He meets a full range of people; from the useless to the heroic, the kindhearted to the cruel, clever and the dull, the strong and the weak. Always in fear about betrayal to the Nazi Gestapos, he is finally rescued, and returns to England -- for the final betrayal that has nothing to do with the Gestapos."
3,"""Fool No More"" is big improvement over previous music","As a major fan of S Club 7, I was curious if S Club 8 could keep up the momentum created by the original seven. Unfortunately, their first album (as S Club Juniors)was too juvenile for my tastes. However, the single ""Fool No More"" shows promise that this group is capable of much more than the song ""Puppy Love"" (Ugh!) Their other release on this single, ""Rush"", is fairly generic but I was really disappointed with ""S Club Party"" which comes off as if S Club 8 was playing karaoke over the original track by the original group. Otherwise, this single is worth buying and provides hope that the new album should be quite good."
5,S Club 8!!!,"It's a sad thing to think about S Club's split, but we have perfect replacements for them in S Club 8! Their first single under the name of S Club 8 (they WERE S Club Juniors) is ""Fool No More"" and it's absolutely fab! Frankie and Rochelle take lead in this song (yaay! Rochelle, you have a main part in a single)! It's very dance-y and sort of electronic-y (in some parts). The video for it is great, too! I LOVE this song! You should definetly buy it! (P.S. If you've watched American Juniors, the song they sang, ""One Step Closer,"" is the first single from these guys! Check them out if you liked the song on the show!) Get with the S!!!"
3,FPS Meets Risk,"Bought the game thinking it was an XBOX redo of the PC Game Robin Hood. Should have read the title better, because I would have realized this was Defender of the Crown with a Robin Hood guise. First levels in Sherwood are fun, but once you go into trying to reclaim the Island, it becomes very difficult. Not recommended for shooters; this is a strategic game. Otherwise, the game has decent graphics and story-lines. Appearances by Little John, Friar Tuck, Maid Marianne, and the Sheriff of Nottingham, among others. Knowing what I know now, I would have browsed past this game for another one."
5,THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!,"This game is Awsome! It is very realistic, in Castle Raid missions if you are killed you are then held captive and have to either Attempt an Escape or Bribe the Guard with 100 Gold. If I were you and had to choose between playing some game like Ninja Gaiden and playing this I would most certainly choose Robin Hood: Defender Of The CrownTHIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!"
2,Poor Quality,"I bought this in a hurry when one of my previous tie-out cables broke, figuring that so long as it was the right length and supported my dog's weight it would be fine. I was sorely disappointed, literally. My wife and I have both managed to get dozens of paper-cut like incisions on our thumbs from the sharp, unfinished edges on the clasp release. The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is that it does at least hold my 70+ lb husky as advertised. I'll be replacing this ASAP and will not be purchasing this again."
1,might be good with a decent editor,"My psychometrics class (in a doctoral psychology program) was assigned this book as the primary textbook. While it gives a decent foundation for some psychometrics principles, it does a horrible job of explaining the nitty-gritty details, particularly because the book contains numerous typographic errors. The professor ended up awarding quite a bit of extra credit to the numerous students who caught typographic errors. The errors definitely create an obstacle to learning the material, and sometimes the errors actually seem to skew the direction of the material. Even numerical errors occur, such as replacing a negative sign (-) with the number 2. Terrible for a textbook whose backbone is statistics!"
1,awful--a real step backwards in travel alarms,"My wife and I both had the previous model Timex Indiglo travel alarm clock for years, and loved it. After much hard use, they eventually died, and we immediately started looking for the same model. Apparently, Timex decided to ""improve"" the original with this model. We bought two, and regretted it immediately. Granted, this is a lot more elegant in aesthetic, and never accidentally flops over on itself as the old model did. But it just doesn't work reliably. The beeping is unreliable--sometimes loud as expected, and sometimes a faint buzz that sounds like a blown speaker. The selector slider gets stuck and is hard to move, and then doesn't click reliably into place at the points you are trying to select. So we are ditching this model. I've heard Timex has rereleased the original model, so I'm looking for it. Whatever you do, don't buy this one."
2,Don't get it twisted....,"I like Shyne, and I like this song. It's just the cd-single just isnt worth picking up. If you like this one song, you should give the whole album a listen. If not, you might wanna try another MC. Like I said, a good song but nothing really exciting on the CD, just a radio mix, club mix and the instrumental...NOT EVEN THE ALBUM VERSION! I gave it two stars cuz the song itself is about a 4 out of 5."
3,"The book is nice, but the CD doesn't work fine.","The book is nice, but the CD doesn't work fine. I can access the .pdf files, but the software doesn't run well."
2,Not Impressed,"When I received the book, several of the pages had been folded on the corners. CD that was suppose to come with the book was missing. I should have done a better job at making sure I bought a new book because Amazon sure didn't do a good job of letting me know I was buying used. This is now the second time I have bought a book from Amazon with less-than-spectacular results; I will buy from another source from here on out."
2,Entertainment Pack for Windows best of 1.0 by microsoft,I also would like to purchase Entertainment Package 1.0 but continue to see you are out of stock . Could you please let me know when you get it in or could you send it to me COD. Ihave seen this pac but can not find it in the local stores. Thank you
5,Entertainment Pack Not a Waste,"The Entertainment Pack for Windows Best Of 1.0 is a collection of the best games included in the 4 entertainment packs. These games take up very little hard drive space and will run on almost any computer. I wohld HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone looking for fun, small games."
4,rodents revenge where are you??,"best of... is an excellent game pak. our whole family plays the many diff. games offerd. this is also the only game pak that has rodents revenge on it, MOMS favoret. unfortunely when we upgraded, we traded off the software along with the hardware, so we lost the game. am still looking for it. maybe ms will add it to thier new upgrade paks..hope so. hats off to the beloved but gone best of...game pak."
1,A Floppy is not a CD.,"I still have the original floppy disks. I purchased this at $150 because it is listed as a CD-ROM. The packing insert lists it as a CD but I opened the box and it is a floppy not a CD. So now I have two floppy disks of BOWEP or MS Best of Entertainment. Very disappointing. My external floppy drive is not shaking hands with the MS laptop that has no integrated drives at all except for the main hard drive. I would not have purchased another floppy so, as good as this game suite is, I have to give it a low rating."
2,"Cute, But Not a Hit in Our Family...","What a silly book. What a silly concept. Now most of the time these two qualities would make a book a hit in our home, but ""T. Rex at Swan Lake"" just sat there without the usual `again' requests.The principle problem, I think, is that T. Rex is relegated to being a skeleton since this is modern times. And at least for my two (girl and boy-5 and 3 respectively) they had a hard time being drawn into a story about a stack of bones. (No dinosaur fanatics here, so do keep that in mind.)Two Stars. It didn't knock our socks off, but if your children are dinosaur fanatics, they may like it better. (The editorial reviewers did an excellent job of summarizing the plot.)"
2,"Promising premise, lousy development","There are some persons that you find very interesting the first time you talk with them, but during the succesive conversations their appeal does not increase, on the contrary, they become more boring and boring and boring.Well this book follows the same pattern with each chapter you read. The line could be summarized as follows: A young Chinese girl is forced to become a prostitute for the officals of the Japanese Army during their invasion of Nanking. The father of girl finds out and kills her Japanese pimp.On the other hand, the 300 pages of the books are just used by the author to show that he knows a lot of vocabulary. Sadly it is used most of the time to take the reader to the arms or Morpheus, not to develop a storyline. Now if you suffer from insomnia that might be a good reason to buy the book."
3,Didn't Work for Me,"I wore these for awhile for running. They gave me shin splints pretty quickly. My legs hurt so bad I had to stop running for the summer. I am an overpronator. The shoes DID hold up well to running, they just didn't work for me."
2,Horrible for non-readersz,"Kids who can't read will need lots of assistance which defeats the purpose I bought it for (keeping the kids busy in the car without needing attention from me!) It just has different cards that say things like ""10 points for finding a pick up truck"", etc. The nameits junior is much better in my opinion. It has ideas to get your whole family thinking. (Name things that have buttons...) We used that one a lot more."
3,"The ""New"" Mamas & Papas 1987","This CD offers 10 songs recorded live on New Year's Eve, 1987, according to the introductory remarks given before the first song. If the picture on the cover is any indication, this is the ""new"" Mamas and Papas, consisting of John Phillips, Mackenzie Phillips, Denny Doherty, and Spanky MacFarland, of Spanky and Our Gang fame. One Spanky and Our Gang song is included, ""Sunday Will Never Be The Same."" The other nine songs are live renditions of the bigger Mamas and Papas hits. The sound is pretty good for a live concert. I wish the CD had more than 10 cuts. If you are new to the Mamas and Papas, you'll probably want to pass on this CD and opt for a ""Best Of"" collection that includes the original recordings. But, if you are a longtime fan, you may want this, especially if you enjoy outtakes or live material."
5,Pleasant story with Sue facing a career conflict,"Sue Barton has been married to Bill Barry for several years in this story. They have three young children: six-year-old Tabitha, and three-year-old twin boys, Johnny and Jerry. Sue has been happy at home taking care of their children, until she and her friend, Kit, visit their old nursing school, and Sue realizes how much she misses nursing. Is Sue's nursing training being wasted as a stay-at-home mom?During the story, Sue gradually realizes that her training is being utilized in other ways. She does first aid for the neighborhood; and she uses her natural gift for helping people to try to bring her new teenage neighbor, Cal, together with the girl's mother, aloof artist Mona Stuart. But will all this be enough for Sue in place of her formal career?This book has been a long-time favorite of mine. It also has the advantage of a pleasant New Hampshire summer as the story's background. Sue's career issues are still relevant today. Highly recommended."
4,An Understanding Heart,"Loren Eiseley is an imaginative writer and developes a reader's interest in his strange life. Eiseley explains his fascination with nature, which began as soon as he could crawl, and this interest was not really supported by anything in his environment. HIs parent's relationship is presented as the boy experienced it, and one feels sympathy for his father, whom Eiseley suggests stayed with his insane wife because of his son. HIs tangled relationship with his mother receives attention at the beginning and end of the book, when she died. It is as if Eisiley himself hasn't digested her impact upon him, which he minimalized as much as he could. For whatever reasons, he became a writer who had to explain interesting things, who thought interesting things, and, yet, was very lonely. It was a lonely life, beautiful though."
4,The Art of Noise,"Those who shy away from noise-rock and avant-garde experimentation may avoid an album like this, but ""mmmr"" isn't arch and inaccessible, like much of Glann Branca's work. In fact, it's surprisingly calm and gorgeous at times, shifting from sheer dissonance to passages of serenity within seconds. And, none of these players are ever far from the foundation of the blues, although that's not to say B.B. King would have any idea what's going on. You can deconstruct this album if you like, or you can play it in the background - believe me, it will work either way. Fans of post-rock should definitely check this out, but anyone who plays the guitar might also want to take a listen to the sonic variety made possible by four committed, intelligent electric guitar experimentalists. It may not be an album you'll play over and over again, or even return to often, but I'm glad I own it, and I'm sure I'll track down other Connors pieces in the future based on the strength of this project."
4,music in its purest form [maybe],"Apparently Loren Mazzacane Connors has been doing the likes of this for 20 years but this is the 1st 1 I've heard, I of course got it for the SY connection. This is sparse almost ambient guitar sounds that do get noisier & clang & bang in the way we like, this sort of thing is good as background music but don't expect top 40 radio types to understand it. If you want a really out there sound try Lee's Scriptures of the Golden Eternity if it's still available."
5,A first rate video by a first rate guy,"Jim teaches you how to make small boxes. But the tape is full of techniques on how to do small piece sawing, grain matching, setting angle cuts, gluing, and fixing mistakes. There is a lot you can learn from this tape even if you never make a box.Jim makes you feel welcome to his shop like you were an old friend. He's a friendly, almost ""aw shucks"" sort of guy.Seeing this tape inspired me to make a lot of boxes and associated items. Jim describes boxes that are great for quick projects, gifts, or craft show sales.Jim was an early editor of Fine Woodworking and was running a custom picture framing shop at the time of this video.This is a fine production and an excellent teaching video."
3,Very advanced information but not practical to use daily,"First of all, I need to clarify my 3 star rating. I rate this book 5 stars for its depth of information, but only 1 star for its usability for practical daily lessons.This book is set up in the format of an advanced grammar handbook or reference guide and has information about grammar that I never learned all the way through college. If you are an adult teacher this is an EXCELLENT guide for you.However, it isn't set up as a lesson type book for homeschool. If you want to take the time as the teacher to plan ahead what you will use from this book and then apply to it to other reading or writing work for your child, then go for it, but that's a LOT of extra work.Don't misunderstand, I am glad I bought this book and will keep it forever as a reference guide. It simply doesn't work for practical daily homeschool lessons."
5,"All meat, cuts out the fat.","Simply the best character book for Maya. Most character books are catered to the movie/tv production pipeline but this one really goes into detail on ""game specific"" aspects of Maya. Let's face it, Maya is a daunting application. You cannot learn everything about it in one book, but what this book does so well is take a specific usage of Maya(for game character creation) and tells you everything you need to know to get a character from concept to final animation.There's meaty info on every page and no long-winded lectures or extranious information not relevent to gaming. I feel that this book can easily be used as a syllabus for game character creation classes.I would never have been able to realize my models without the insight provided in this book.-Rodney Brettpodman@rodbrett.com"
1,"Looks cool, but...","I had read some good things about this unit, and liked the different charging options, ear sizes, etc.. but the audio quality is horrible.While reception is fine, except in the absolute quietest of environments, people report that 'background' sounds are as loud, if not louder than my own voice. Even just walking produces enough 'wind' noise to make he repeatedly have to shout to make myself heard.I'm afraid I can't recommend it to anyone."
4,great with 2 drawbacks,"this is a great bt headset, extremely comfortable and the charging options are wonderful, however there are two drawbacks you should be aware of:1.) it's not the loudest headset and this can be a problem in noisy enviornments2.) in wi-fi areas there is a lot of static and it can be annoying if you live in an area with many routers."
3,Sorry but I'm still not excited after 2 days,"Heard lots of good reviews from the internet and I bought it for my ppc6700 pda phone. Well, I must say I'm not a seasoned BT users but so far I have tried both Sony's and Motorola's, the voice quality is not worth the money. I was really looking forward to this one, but...1: the fit in the ear is not secure, feels loose after a whileguess I need to attach the ear loop(BTW, very nice package)2: The voice quality is much better compare with others, whenit's good. The problem is that it's very sensible to theposition, I start to hear pops/cracks if my arm or hands getbetween my phone and headset, very annoying. Feels like thisheadset is on weak side for BT signal strength.3: It would be great if the headset can be hang on the neck,the pocket in package is not very useful.Compare with other review my score may looks low but the cracks are very very anoying, make you think wired solution may not be that bad."
2,Good for short calls in quite rooms by people with little heads,"This device looks too good to be true. So small it just sticks to your ear, with no wires to deal with! this was my first Bluetooth headset so I can't compare it to others, but it seems that when they make a headset this small, the mic is so far from your mouth that it has to be very sensitive to pick up your voice-- that means it picks up all the other noise as well! It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed. It has a little analog static and noise that is annoying. My advice, don't buy a phone like the RAZR V3 planning to use a bluetooth headset until you have talked TO someone calling you from one! Side note, I had to buy an extended (2x thickness of the OEM battery) so that I could use a bluetooth device for more than an hour."
4,Excellent Hands Free,"Excellent hands free. Very light. Easy to operate. The chargin options are really creative. The only thing I miss.... a led so I can know who is calling without seeing the telephone. I have it attached to a XDA IIs with no problems.Otto, San Jose Costa Rica"
3,ear bud's don't stay in ear very well,The wire piece that wraps around the ear is too small and is difficult to use..The ear buds you push in and turn either right or left depending on what ear your putting it on.. The plantronics 320 I previously purchased is in my opinion easier to use.. Sound wise there both adequate..
2,"Looked Good, But....","I read many reviews before purchasing this product. Once I got the 640, I had difficulty getting the pocket charger and the AC charger to connect. After I got them to work, I did not see the problem again.Pairing with my Audiovox PPC-6600 was a breeze. However, there was static when the phone was on my belt and the headset was in my ear on the same side as the phone.The gel earpiece is wonderfully comfortable and the 640 is very lightweight. The earpiece audio quality is great and the volume was very good.However, everyone I talked to commented that I either had a cold or was on an echoey speaker phone. No one thought the audio quality was good.Plantronics tech support confirmed that this audio quality is inherent in the design. The pocket charger is really great. It gives me a place to put the headset when not in use and it charges the headset between usage...very nice.I really wish Plantronics would have put more effort into improving the audio quality."
4,Can't complain,"So far, it's worked out well. I don't have any trouble with it although some have said they can hear me better if I didn't use this piece. Nonetheless, it's doing what it's supposed to do - allow me to talk handfree, so there is no complain from me. The fit is comfortable enough for me to carry on a long conversation (1.5 hour conference calls, for example)."
2,"Buyer Beware, Glue Req'd for installation","Beware, the headset does not mount properly into the charger. The tension fastner does not hold the earset into place and therefore has to be rigged to work properly. I've learned from reading customer reviews in various chatrooms that the best fix is to apply a dab of glue inside the charger to get the headset to fit snug inside the charger. You gotta be kidding me!What good is a device if it can't be charged properly? Why should I have to come up with clever solutions just to get a brand new device to charge.The standard AC adapter also does not work with the standard charger adapter, which is another ridiculous defect.Ive never seen anything this ridiculous!"
4,Great Product,"I really like the small size and light weight of this product. My only problem is with the rubber earpieces. None of the three fit my ear properly, so I have to use the clip, which is fine."
3,Technology not there yet,I have tried every Bluetooth headset out there. I thought that this would be the one. It sounds pretty good when in a quiet enviroment but in the car that's another thing. Now to be fair it could be the interaction with my phone. I have an LG. But when driving in the car my friends tell me that I'm understandable but there is a lot of background noise. A corded headset is much quieter. It's fine in a room but if there is noise around the mike will pick it up. If you are in a room without carpet you will hear the echoing in the room. So personally I will stick with my $20 chorded headset and use this one around the house.
3,"Great product, poor packaging","The headset is great, the communication is clear, better than any other I have tried in the past.The charger broke very quickly - The only way to re-charge now is to keep the headset standing up when being re-charged. Poor design!"
4,Not crazy about it yet!,"The sound is great, people say it sounds great to them, but I am still trying to adapt to it. I do not like the ""over the ear hook"" and it keeps falling out but that's on me. The Bluetooth is good"
4,Love it !!!!,Initially it took me 3 - 4 days to figure this out and get it working....I did some Google search to make it compatible with my BB Bold and now its working all well......The sound - voice clarity is really good....
2,Dog walker,"I got this because I am now all cell. It had a good fit, but my mom couldn't hear well at all. I tried everything, volume adjustment, but no better. I returned it"
5,Fantastic,"I was slightly overwhelmed with the sheer volume of stuff that came with this headset, but once I figured out what I needed and actually started using it I was really impressed. Very clear, volume levels are great, extremely comfortable snug fit. Love it."
1,Don't Waste your time,"1st off no Problems with the seller,(Unlockedcellphonekings) Package right on time and I got what I paid for. The only thing is I over looked the fact that this Bluetooth was made in 2005. They don't tell you that! 2005 It may have been top of the line, but it is 2011 and lots have happened in B.T. technology since then. Just boxed it up to return... my bad, my loss in shipping.. glad to see it go!! Buy yourself a $20.00 headset with a cord you are gonna be way happier..."
1,Won't charge,"I just received my headset yesterday. I placed it into the provided charging cylinder to charge for a full day. I've come to realize that the head set does not securely lock into it's holster - that, or the charging cord does not have a tight connection. The headset has not charged. There's a red light that goes on for a moment when I place the headset in the cylinder, but it only illuminates for a moment. Considering sending this unit back..."
3,Nice but doesn't hold up,"This was a nice bluetooth at first. The sound was great and it was very comfortable, but then as it got worn in, the ear piece (which rotates on the spindle which is attached to the part that goes in your ear) became loose. At first it only rotated when I would adjust it, but after about 5 months, it just spins on its own and won't stay pointed at my mouth. It just hangs straight down from my ear in other words."
4,Great Deal,"This Blue Tooth is well worth the money. It is more comfortable than other blue tooths I've had. In fact, I don't use the part that goes over your ear and often forget it's even on. Very comfortable!It also has good sound quality. I can hear very well with it, and others hear me very well (without much background interference, which is nice!).The other perk that I found really neat was that it comes with 2 ways to charge the blue tooth: 1) Plugging into the wall, or 2)Plugging it into a battery powered portable charger. Very nice!The only 2 downsides I've found are: 1) The battery life is about 3-4 hours of talk time. 2) Turning it on and off is a bit tricky. I seem to not hold the on button long enough sometimes and it starts scanning like I'm trying to set it up. Probably just a user issue here I suppose :)"
4,bad ear pice and noise cancalation but...,"i bought this for doing a pod cast under ideal conditions, background noise wise. and knowing the ear piece was crap and possibly would need glue. im happy to say its not as bad as i thought. - 1 * cuz of the ear piece is still not great for travel but in a room with no music or no streets to lose the ear plug it will serve greatpro- aaa charger- it picks up everything thing clearlycon-n ear pice falls out too easyIT PICKS UP E V E R Y T H I N G CLEARLY"
3,"Good sound quality, good fit is short-lived","The sound quality of this unit is good enough for my needs, though the volume does not go as low as I'd like sometimes when the other party is very loud.My major gripe is that with the proper sized earpiece, the unit rotates so that it hangs straight down making my voice muffled to the other party. Adding the optional ear loop works OK but this setup tends to fall apart very easily. I think the reality is that for good stability you need the ear loop, but again, the thing tends to fall apart too easily (not break mind you but the earpiece falls off allowing the ear loop to also fall off).I will look for a more stable solution in the future."
4,"First blue tooth ear piece, and its a good one!","This blue tooth headpiece works great with my Samsung SCH-u740 (dual flip phone). The only issues I have is that it's battery life doesn't seem to be as long as I would like, and sometimes the reception is a little raspy. But all in all i would recommend it."
3,Good enough,The headset works fine... The only thing that I find annoying is the recharger that it gets placed into. It doesn't seat firmly and could be improved.
3,Not good,"I bought this headset for 80 bucks after reading all the good reviews. Let me tell you the truth...it worked great in the first few days, then started troubling me. Charging this is a pain...the wall charger has a pen-cap shaped device where you have to insert this into...it gets inserted but does not touch the charging pins that easy. I have to press a little to make it hit the charging pins but that gets loose as well and does not charge. I have never tried the pen charger. Sound quality is not that great either. Overall to expensive for the product"
3,Not for me,"Let me start by saying that I am a regular everyday consumer. I'm not a specialist or an expert.The most important reason why this headset is NOT for me is the comfort level. For me, even the smallest earbud was painful and the thin loop pinched the back of my ear. It was bad enough that I fiddled with it the ENTIRE time I was in the grocery store (my first errand after I bought it) and I ended up just throwing it back into my purse. I returned it soon after.I can't complain about the sound. It seemed nice and clear when I was trying it out. I Wasn't fond of the lack of a call waiting feature but I was willing to deal with that if the headset was comfortable.Let me end this by saying this....... a LOT of reviews are about things like this. It's about cutomer preference. Just because I couldn't get the 640 to fit me properly does NOT mean you won't be able to."
4,works good for a bluetooth device,"I think it's one of the better bluetooth devices out there. The distance from the headset to the phone was pretty far and I didn't hear much crosstalk. The headset felt comfortable to wear, and secure when I also used the over the ear mount. The additional, included, charging devices (battery and plugin) with the different compatible plugs is a plus when travelling. Easy to set up with your phone too."
4,Better than most,"I definitely like this headset. This is my third one (others were Jabra and even a Scala 500) and it works the best. It has clear sound, others can hear me fine and it is definitely the most comfortable. The only thing I do not like is that the earpiece falls off pretty easiely if used in conjuction with the ear hook, and if not then can be a little difficult to situate in ear. However, overall the earpiece is still better than the others with just mics really close to your ear. I would definitely recommend it. I can't wait until they make headsets that don't disconnect from the phone on their own and have a better voicedial system."
4,cool earpiece,"This is my first bluetooth headset for my Nokia phone. I bought it for the ""cool"" factor, because it's small and won't clutter up my ear too much. The sound is pretty good; I mostly use it while driving in the car and not as much outdoors, although so far it's worked well outside too. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't alway stay snug in its charger, I often have to push it down the charging cylinder with my thumb, which makes for awkward driving & charging in the car. However I don't have to recharge it that often. It's good for at least 2-3 days of use, as I talk on it for maybe an hour a day, turning it off between uses."
3,Good headset but not for noisy environments,"I like the ""in the ear"" approach. It's extremely comfortable. You have several options as far as finding a comfortable fit. It comes with a portable charger, which is a prelude to things to come.I could hear any caller without problems but in noisy environments they couldn't hear me. In a quite environment it worked very well. The battery is terrible. Their listing is ""up to 3 hours"". There's no way you can get that much talk time out of this. I heard allot of static. I couldn't wear my phone in the holster because of that.I'm a frequent business traveler and it doesn't work well for my needs. However, it does have some positive traits. The main two problems are extraneous noise problem and poor battery life. So if you're not in a loud area or heavy user it's a great headset."
3,Right about in the middle. Not a fan of the detachable earpiece.,"I have had other Plantronics headsets before(520 Voyager) and they were fine, so when I saw this headset, it's ratings and it's price,I thought, why not? Well, I got it very fast and got it all set up. Not a fan of the proprietary plug for the charger. Big fan of the on the fly portable charger. Very nice. I would say that this headset holds it's charge longer than most.The clarity is good, everyone still thinks I'm riding a train in a tunnel(this never changes no matter the headset) and the fit is great. Only problem I really have with the earpiece is the detachable fitting. I'm all a fan of having multiple sizes to get it right, but this is ridiculous. Most of the time I am trying to get the piece in my ear while I'm driving, it comes off the headset. I have to use the ear loop attachment and maybe this causes the issue. Still, poor design in my mind. That would lead me to not buy this one again."
2,The headset does not snap into the charger firmly,As on of the other guys said and I bring exactly the same words:The headset does not snap into the charger firmly--it mainly relies on gravity to maintain electrical contact with the cradle. If it tips ever so slightly to the wrong angle it can lose contact and the hours you thought were spent charging your headset were really doing nothing at all. That is a big flaw.Well it's true. I even returned the first one I got from Amazon and asked the vendor to send me another one. The did but the new one had the same problem. I am using elastic band or other things to keep it firm in its place.Anyway other than that I am content with it and I gave 2 so that anybody who wants to buy it come to see why I gave this number. This way the vendor might solve the problem.
2,Not that impressed,"The sound quality is OK, but the part I have the probem with is storage when I am not using it. The ear gel and the ear stabilizer keep coming off the unit where ever I place it in whatever pocket. It is destined to get lost. I would recommend against this. It is physically too many parts. P.S. It really pissed me off that it has no adapter for one of the most popular phones interface. The mini USB for the razor."
2,Great product / very easy to lose,"This headset was great, it worked really good with my phone and laptop. But I dropped and lost the headset with in the first 24 hours while carying it in the provided carrying pocket.So my advice if you buy this headset don't trust the carrying pocket.I have contacted support to see if I can purchase just the headset part at a discounted price, and the price they have quoted me, just for the headset part, was actually higer than what I have paid for the whole product at amazon.com."
3,Good but charger needs replacement,"This headset is very light, with extremely good reception, even when walking in different rooms. However, the charger is terrible! It does not always hook to the earpiece, and stops charging it after a few seconds...It is too sad to see such a nice earpiece suffer from the charger..."
2,discovery 640 headset,"the sound is very good. it's light and easy to use. it comes with several adapters for the charger, even one that works with my treo charger. that's a big plus. but it doesn't make up for the disappointing battery life. it lasts about a day. my previous headset was a plantronics 320. its battery lasted several days."
3,"Nice, but...","The 640 is a really nicely packaged product coming in a great carrying case & attachments for charging it using most of today's charger plug types. (Don't expect to use a newer Samsung plug though.)The biggest drawbacks to this unit are as follows:1) Sound quality isn't as great as many cheaper Plantronics models.2) Ear plugs come off of the unit way too easily & can be lost as well as the ear stabalizer loops.3) Mic isn't as good as cheaper Plantronics models.The silicone ear plugs are a nice feature, coming in three sizes to fit your ear & preference.Personally, I'd suggest saving the money & buying the Plantronics 540."
2,Not so good for me!,"I see most really like this headset. The reason I bought it was because it got mostly good reviews. Mine is not so good. People on the other end have great difficulty hearing me, unless I am I a completely quiet room. In the car, even with the radio down & windows up, those I call have great difficulty hearing me, & are so happy when I disconnect & go to the regular mobile phone. If I am in a store, or not in a quiet room, the headset has difficulty understanding voice commands. I wish I had researced a bit more before I made this purchase."
4,Good headset,"Pros: Excellent audio quality, Ive never had anyone complain that they couldnt hear me properly. Incomming audio is also excellent. Its lighweight, and has many charging attachments.Cons: Charger is loose often times will stop charging; you have to move it around a bit untill the red light comes back on. You have to set it down gently and hope the red light stays on.Headset is a little loose for me so I use the optional behind the ear attachment."
1,Poor Performance,"Purchased bluetooth on 4/5/07. Used about 4 times. Then when trying to re-charge, it failed to work at all. Went on vacation for a month and have just returned. I am in the process of returning for refund or a new bluetooth. Needless to say, I am very disappointed for the short time that it was used and to have it fail. I hope that Amazon will stand behind this product."
1,Great ideas - Lousy execution,"I wish I could give this ear-piece a better score, but with all of it's great features, it does not do what is most important - communicate! After a few days I returned it.The pros - Very light, can charge on the go, can hear others fine.The cons - No one can hear me! I had several people complain about not understanding me. And if that doesn't work then all the features in the world don't matter.I was very disappointed in this model and I wouldn't recommend it. Wait until the next model and they might have the bugs worked out. However I will still stick with plantronics. A friend has purchased the Voyager 510 and he seems pleased, and I can understand him just fine when talking to him.So like I said, great idea, but not worth the money."
2,Nice idea but poorly implemented,"I've had one of these for a week of intensive testing. I found that my Nokia charger didn't work with it, in fact I tried three from different Nokia models. The ear piece was comfortable to wear but slipped down my face because of the poor design of the ""gel"" connection to the device. I also experienced poor battery life. In other words 48 hours stand-by and one and half hours of talk time. Sound quality was excellent but there were a few crackles. It comes with a holder it snaps into but it doesn't stay in place and is always falling out. I'm sure you'd loose it easily.All in all it's a shame they couldn't get the design robust enough for everyday use. I suspect the battery life is because the model is faulty.I bought it to replace the Jabra BT200 I gave to my wife but I've now returned it and will be replacing it with another Jabra."
1,Very poor design,"Overall this unit has a very cheap and flimsy feel. Voice quality was OK both in and out. However, the charging case does not hold the unit securely, causing the unit to quit charging. Forget the pocket battery charger because it definitely will disconnect causing the unit, once again, to quit charging. The owners manual is printed so small that I had to use a magnifying glass to read it. In summary, just a very poor design."
3,"your voice sound is poor, very delicate BUT doesn't connecto to my iPhone 3GS!!!","I have two of this.Actually, I really like this BT design because the style, light and charging options. The aluminium case is fantastic for travelers and keep the stuff organized and your attention calmed down w/o worries about loosing any piece.First one doesn't connect via BT to my iPhone 3gS, and, obviously I assume was a little tech trouble, so I received another one as a gift for a close friend of mine.What a big surprise when I realize that the second one doesn't connect either!!PS: they (both) do connect via BT to iphone 4g.Hope there is no trouble with my iphone 3gS, by now..."
3,Great in quiet environment,The headset works great in a quiet environment but is almost useable while driving in my BMW. People complain about too much road noise.
2,Good but not Great in the car,"This Discovery 640 does a good job of connecting and re connection to my Motorola Razr. I get great sound on my end but as with many of these headsets the other party comments that I sound like I'm talking with my head in an echo filled bucket. Call quality in a quiet room, is okay, but in my car, (where most of us would use a headset) my voice sounds hollow as the road noise competes with my voice.Before I purchased this item I saw another model with noise reduction circuitry. I wish I'd purchased that one.On the positive side the box, the associated chargers and the mult-charge heads make the storage of the entire unit very convenient. This part is well thought out."
2,Deteriorating Quality,"I bought a 640 about three months ago. At first I was very happy with the quality, battery life and comfort. After the first month the battery life shortened to where I could not get three hours of talk time a day after a full 12 hour charge. The connection between the ear peace and the headset began to loosing and no longer hold its position in your ear.I called and requested a replacement and Plantronics was very quick to overnight me a new one.I've now had the new on for about a months and signs of deteriorating quality have begun. I just called plantronics and they are sending me a Voyager 510. Quite a bit bigger than the 640 but maybe I can talk for more than three hours. If I have any issues with the 510 I think my Plantronic days are over."
4,My second bluetooth headset,Currently enjoying this headset after 6 months. Very light. I wear it all day and easily forget about it until the phone rings. Good reception. Stays charged all day even after extended use. I recommend this headset.
4,I'd rather quit breathing than go back to not using a bluetooth headset,"Okay maybe a little dramatic, but this is hands down the best investment ever. My first bluetooth phone (motorola v557) and headset. This product works fabulously with it. Even if it looses the connection, it finds it again easily.I have small ears and HATE earpieces that go inside my ear. But this one fits wonderfully! I use the small piece that goes around the ear also just to make sure it has a snug fit. You can also easily wear your sunglasses!! Unlike the other big bluetooth earpieces.I am a wedding planner, so I cannot wait to try out using this while I am at the wedding...leaving my hands free to carry stuff and do business.The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because there is static sometimes. Honestly I think there is with any headset. But it's not that bad when you consider the freedom you have and ability to be safer while you drive.Hands down, you should try this product."
5,Excellent!,"I'm using this headset with my razr v3 and everything about it is great. I can hear the person on the other line very clearly. No one has reported ever having a problem hearing me. All the buttons are easy to use and the ear gels are great. The only problem I found is that my charger for my razr dosent fit the adpaters given, but this isnt really a big deal since you are given 2 other methods to charge it anyway."
2,Poor Charging unit,"The headset works good, but the charging unit is worse then poor. When you plug it in you think everything is going to be ok, but as soon as you walk away the charging light goes off. It doesn't matter how much you wiggle the connection or try taping it, the light eventually goes off and not because it is charged fully. This is the same for the car charger, which is just as awkward looking as the wall charger. I wouldn't purchase a plantronics again, until they change their charging plug design. It is more annoying then it is worth."
3,Not Good When There is A lot of Noise,"I do not want to write much but I do want to say that the noise cancellation is not good at all. When I am in noisy or windy environments almost everyone asks that I call them back when it is less noisy.In quiet conditions, everthing is fine."
5,Awesome headset,"This headset is truly great. I have owned a Bluetrek G2 and a Bluespoon AX2 before this one. This one is the best one I have used so far.Light weightin ear designpretty loudGood sound quality, in and outNice charging and storage optionsThe only bad thing about this headset is the price. Other than that this thing has been awesome so far. Buy it!"
2,"I loved it, but would not invest in one again.","I purchased two of these discovery 2 years ago and after a month had to send one in for repair, it wouldn't take a charge. It was replaced and I've used it up until a couple of weeks ago, again it won't take a charge. The other one I purchased two years ago went out after about a year and yes it wouldn't take a charge. I really like the size and quality of the volume, its trendy and small for traveling, unlike the other bulky bluetooths available. I would have to say if you buy one and plan on using it for a few years take out an extended warranty, otherwise you will end up in the same situation as myself."
3,Disappointed,I have owned the Discovery 645 Headset and loved it. I was disappointed in this headset. It is always falling apart and losing the ear plug. The sound quality is not as good as the 645. I will be purchasing a new headset soon.
3,Not that happy with my Plantronics Discovery 640,Lacks adequate battery life and swivels to far on the ear piece so that it hangs down close to vertically from my ear.
4,Liking it so far,"A lot of reviews have talked about how the headset does not stay in the charging tube properly thus failing to charge and/or dropping out. I am guessing Plantronics have improved the design because the one I got for Christmas sits securing in the charger -- it actually clicks in place. It doesn't fall out, isn't loose, and charges reliably. So it looks like they have addressed that criticism.I haven't had many opportunities to use this headset yet, but I can say it is very lightweight and comfortable to wear. I cannot figure out how to insert it securely in my ear (I've tried all three earbuds), so I have opted to use the stabilizer loop, which I find is comfortable and no hassle to use. I had no trouble pairing this to my Katana phone. Sound is great. I haven't tried it in a noisy environment though. Also, the adapters don't help me since it doesn't have one that works with my phone, but I knew that before asking to get this."
5,MSB-As good as ever,I have almost every MSB CD including his solos. I have not purchased any new CDs since the 90's but this CD is fantastic. Everything you like about MSB is wrapped up in all these hits. His sound and silky way is still there after all these years.Every song is great!!!!! Long Live Michael Stanley-Cleveland Rocks!!!!!!!
3,I hope there is an unofficial version.,"3 stars for the statistics. I hope there is an unoffical version. This book is minimally helpful. It has nice pictures and statistics. But, I don't think it helps rpg novices or M.M.VI novices, much. A strategy guide should help the beginner get started better. This book was for the expert rpg player and very disappointing."
3,The Standard Prima Strategy Guide...,"This book gets the job done, and it gets the job done well. It displays much-needed stats, and also has some general pointers. Nothing groundbreaking, but if you're stuck on MMVI, this will definitely help."
4,You can't play without it,"DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT TRY TO PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT THIS BOOK! I saves lots of time, and energy. It would be nice though to have a section on where things are at in specific villages and towns, EX.training centers, armor shops. Where the building is specifically>"
3,NOT A STRATEGY GUIDE,"This guide offers some help but dost tell you where to go or what to do, some quests that you get are too tough for your party to handle. The monsters that you run into are way too many for your party to take on in real time combat for example it does not tell you about ambushes when you open chests like the ones in the Temple of Baa.The guide does offer some help in spells,weapons,armour,skills and monsters but that about it,it does not tell you what party to take. If you want a book with maps and some help buy it, but it will not walk you through the game, you will have to run and shoot alot in the dungeons.This book does guide you through quests but it does not tell you about what monsters are there waiting for your party. I bought it for the maps and locations of dungeons,fountains,towns and items in the dungeons.It tells you where to go in the dungeons to get what you whant.This book is addictive so get ready to use it alot happy adventuring."
4,A nice addition to the game,"Loaded with valuable information, quest summaries, strategy tips; this guide is a must for the serious Might and Magic VI gamer."
2,Too much and not enough,"This book contains just enough info to be a spoiler, not enough to be particularly usefull. The book is great for giving away the plot without revealing solutions for puzzels. Vital locations are only given the vaguest of hints, while the book seems to go out of its way to reveal all the plot devices. The maps aren't particularly helpfull, especially since the automap feature does as good a job. NOTE: The maps do not reveal the locations of secret doors (unless it leads to something vital in completing the quest)"
2,Poor Design of Blade Lock,"Appearance is nice. However, like the same knife branded and sold by other companies, the design and implementation of the blade locking mechanism seems nothing more than an afterthought. It is nothing more than a dimple in the latch that swings shut with some difficulty onto the blade."
2,Great knive but save yourself almost $10,The knife is great; the leather holster is... not. Save some money and get just the knife here:Sheffield 12115 Premium Folding Lock-Back Utility Knife
2,useless,"This item is completely useless. I ordered it, installed it, connected it, tried to use it..............no feedback. Adjusted the connection...............no feedback. Tried to use it with a ""learning piano"" software which was specially designed for it..................nothing. Changed my control panel settings..................nothing. Maybe its just me!"
3,Silver Medal try....but no,"An avid fan of this band I am, but the switch over to the label isn't cutting it. Anything off the GRP label is great. This one is definitely one to own, but not my favorite."
2,I guess I Don't See it!!,"This is NOT one of the Ripp's best efforts....it's more like a Russ Freeman disc with guest artists as opposed to a group. For those of you who like their jazz ""lite"", there are actually better albums out there. If you are a serious Rippingtons fan -- this disc will truly test your loyalty. I guess I just don't get all of the hype!"
3,Somewhat Of A Comeback!!!!,"After two miserable studio CD's in a row (Sahara and Brave New World) The Rippington's are back with somewhat of a comeback CD. They also switched record labels to Windham Hill...perhaps, that is the reason for all the new material...instead, of a several lousy remakes just to fill a CD. The tracks Black Diamond, Deep Powder, Seven Nights In Rome, and Big Sky are the best ones. This CD is rather Latin and guitar-based, but it sure is an improvement."
2,What Russ Freeman saw in Mark Williamson is anyone's guess ........,"This is The Rippingtons' equal worst album, due mainly to the vocal contribution on 7 of 11 tracks by Mark Williamson. The only good track is ""Seven Nights In Rome"". If you are new to this group, don't start here. If you are a diehard fan like me, you still need this album because it is the only place you can get that song."
4,Heavy Blues Psych Rock,"After Tea were a late 60s Dutch band formed from members of the Tee Set who wanted to stretch out with some heaviness they weren't afforded in their previous band. From 1970 originally, this album was one of only two they recorded, and has plenty of long screaming guitar heavy bluesy and early progressive influenced tracks."
2,Toyota wheel cover set.,"The wheel covers arrived quickly and intact. However, I discovered after unpacking them that they were fake and made of plastic, with fake decorative lug nuts. Nothing in the description indicated that they were anything but real wheel covers. We snapped them on and they look okay, but they crack easily. I would not purchase again."
5,Another interesting profile,"I found this to be yet another poignant and prolific work from Christopher Andersen. He is truly one of the great biographers of our time. Although I am not a fan of George W. Bush, this book was a perfect blend of solid investigative journalism and touching human complexities. I saw both the president and his wife in a new light. Once again Mr. Andersen has earned the praises of this reader!"
3,minor error,"A puzzling minor error: page 42 says ""Blacks (in Midland, TX) went to their own schools, not to Sam Houston Elementary. There were separate waiting rooms for them at the courthouse..."" However page 46 says ""there were no blacks in town then -- I mean none."""
3,"Interesting, but nothing new","George and Laura is a book that proves interesting for political aficionados, yet reveals hardly anything to write home about. Although some liberal reviewers have made mention to the contrary, this book is no 'fluff' account intended to pander to the Bushes. It is, for all intents and purposes, a look into the trying times of 9/11, the blunders of Bush's exceedingly chronicled youth, the meeting of the two, as well as the incredible adversity overcome by both.While reading this, at times I would feel that this was a malicious attack on the Bushes, but all in all, it was relatively evenhanded as it revealed both good and bad accounts of their lives. I was unaware of Laura's vehicular manslaughter incident as well as her near death experience while delivering the twins. Other than that, this book provides few insights into their lives. In summation, I deem it worth a checkout from the library, but hardly worth a purchase."
4,A good book!,"A good account of the President and First lady. The book goes into many details of the first couple (their childhoods, how they met, the President's drinking problem, the 2000 Presidential election, their daughters, 9/11). The book is fast moving and not tedious. A funny line from the book: Laura, a former librarian, said of her husband's lack of interest in books :""George thought a bibliography was the story of the guys who wrote the Bible."" If you are interested in the President and First lady buy it."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Author Christopher Anderson's book to promote the Bush's loving marriage seems more like a superficial attempt to hide his own contempt for the President and Mrs. Bush. Endless snide remarks and cutting inuendos by the author coupled with a parade of supposed skeletons in the Bush closet give the reader a roller-coaster of a ride more downhill than up. The old adage ""Believe nothing that you read and only half what you see"" should be warning enough to those who still buy this book. There is deception in the title. Perhaps like you, I was expcecting a clear and uplifting read on our beloved President and First Lady. Unlike you, I bought this book. The bottom line: I can't recommend this to anyone though I gave it one star for the opening chapter (the day of September 11th) and for the photographs."
5,Insightful,"I loved this book. It was like a ""Biography"" episode including details on families, childhoods. I see one person wrote ""come on George you can do better than this"" uh...hello..he didn't write the book! another saying ""pure fiction"". Not sure how listing moving here and moving there and various jobs and turmoil is fiction, but there's a hate filled liberal for you. I thought this was a nice sweet book about real people and it's nice to be reminded they still exist, politics aside.It made me want to read more about Bush Sr. and Barbara, which is how I wondered into this area..I thought I may as well post."
4,very sharp on the DX body and good for FX,"This is more a need buy. I own a DX camera in the Nikon D7000 all of my wide angle lenses are DX, like the tokina 11-16, nikon 35mm 1.8, and my old 18-200VR. But all my other longer lenses are FX, so I need something a little wider then my 35-70mm f2.8 FX for my new D600 and a new (but used) FM2 35mm film body. On the D7000 the image is very sharp, as sharp as the 50mm 1.8d."
2,useless,"24mm turns into 35mm in a D90 or D7000, and at f2.8, it's not that different from f3.6 zoom lense included with factory combos, hence, it's useless. if it was f1.8 or even f2 I'd say go for it. Otherwise, don't waste your money. I was lucky to be able to get rid of it without losing too much money."
3,Slow and out of date,Bought this lens for head-to-toe candid shots from five-ten feet away in uncontrolled/variable light settings with my D-80 . Auto-focus is slow and unreliable. Can't recall a single picture taken with this lens which I liked. Pictures are ultimately soft.
2,Exchanged for other Nikon Lens,"I really didn't have anything wider than a 35mm 1.8 in my camera bag so I thought this would be a great addition when I needed to go wider. Unfortunately the 24 2.8 was not up to par with Nikon's newer AFS primes that I own (35 1.8, 50 1.8) in terms of sharpness or speed of autofocus. I had it less than two weeks then returned it. The only way I was ever pleased with the lens was when I was right on top of the subject (which accounts for about 5% of my shooting). Instead I purchased the Nikon 24-120 f/4 and have been very pleased. The 24-120 shot at 24mm is much sharper wide open than the 24 2.8 wide open so if you can live without the 2.8, look at other options like the 24-120. The beauty of owning the 24-120 is that I still have a fairly wide angle when needed, and a great all-around lens when just out shooting for the day."
5,Better than I thought,"I use it only for a month now, but it feels great, looks great, but more importantly delivers nice pics. I use it on a D90, mainly for family shots and on excursions. Rarely replaced by other lenses. Only if its important to have tack sharp portraits. Than I change for my 50mm AF-S. All in all I like it a lot."
5,Incredible Bang-for-Buck Wide Nikkor Lens,"This lens is tack sharp, has great bokeh, and very decent low-light performance. Image quality is right on par with the pro-grade 14-24 2.8 zoom; and dollar for dollar, I'd say this lens holds its own very well against anything you want to compare.I find myself using this one as a walk-around lens on my D90 more often than not. If you're ok with using a prime lens and having to move around more to get your compositions correct, I would highly recommend this lens!"
3,Decent,Ok sound for the price the Philips SHE5920 or the JVC marshmellows I like b/c they have better bass responce. But of corse they do the in-ear type.
1,Consider these disposable,"I loved these headphones at first - the sound quality was great! But less than a month after using them, I'm back here shopping for a better quality pair of earbuds. I used these while basically sitting still at my desk in work. The wires are so cheap that the right ear barely works, and the left ear is not much better. It's so annoying to have the sound cut out from any gentle head movement. I can't wait to throw these in the trash."
4,They are what they are,"Don't expect anything outstanding soundwise, but as far as $5 earbuds go these are solid. The usual tinny bass, but they're very comfortable and inconspicuous, which is all you can ask for from your earbuds. Whether you need a pair of tiny, cheap headphones to run with or your iPod earbuds finally fell apart, these'll do the trick."
2,Hit and a Miss,"I wanted to open myself up to some artists I hadn't really listened to before, and that played into the industrial/goth rock kind of scene. I do this quite frequently where I'll purchase a compilation CD, and I've never really gone wrong with it. This one; however, was just not my cup of tea. I really liked ""Evil Force In My Pants"" by Louie Fontaine just because of the odd music, and there were a couple other songs that weren't too bad, but they didn't catch me enough to get any more into the artist's work aside from what I have on this CD. All in all, the other reviews are right, this is for hardcore fans who really know the artists."
5,I pray that this is well received.,"If your looking at this then you probably already know about Tales From the Crypt, so I don't really need to explain the show or why it's great. This is so awesome that they are releasing it on DVD and LONG overdue. I hope that it is well received by the public so that other seasons will also see DVD status."
3,Tales from the Crypt,"I enjoyed the watching disc one, but disc two was just some history of the show and some interviews ."
5,"Welcome Kiddies, For Some Frightful Fun",man i remember when this show was on tv. i used to watch it now and then i actually can't beilive how old it is. well i'm glad it's on dvd now. this is a awesome show. if you have not seen this season yet or the show then i recommend that you do.the est episodes in this season are1. The Man Who Was Death3. Dig That Cat...He's Real Gone4. Only Sin Deep5. Lover Come Hack Me6. Collection Completed
5,Good Collection,"Excellent DVD release; excellent quality, the fact that the introduction theme is skipped in all episodes does not bother me at all. The bonus material is more than great, 56 min documetary about not only how the comics became a TV series, but also about the history of making the comics in the 50's.I strongly recommend buying this set."
3,Good buy for fans,"It is a good buy if you used to love the show on HBO. It only has 6 episodes, so its a quick season. Its disappointing there isnt more bonus features, but the show is still a classic."
4,macabre humor at its finest..,if you like your humor dark (or your horror light)..then this show is specially made for you. Produced by several Hollywood A-list filmmakers and starring well-known actors this series was a real treat when it aired during the early to mid '90's.
4,An Awesome Season!!!,"This is an awesome season with some great episodes! I was too young to see this show when I was little. (There was an episode that I saw as a kid that was in my head for years, and I finally found it 2 years ago in a later season, so we'll cross that bridge when we come to it) During this season an executioner carries out his job after being fired, Santa Claus tries to kill a woman, a man has the 9 lives of a cat, smokin' hot Lea Thompson sells her beauty and becomes ugly and much more! My 2 favorite episodes are And All Through the House, and Only Sin Deep! Join the Crypt Keeper for some classic horror tales! I highly recommend TALES FROM THE CRYPT: THE COMPLETE 1ST SEASON!!!"
1,In and Out of the Garden,"I picked this book up because it looked interesting, I love all books about gardening. I didn't have my reading glasses at the time I purchased this book. When I sat down to read it, with my glasses on, I couldn't make out most of it. The type is extremely small, the font color is somewhat washed out, and the calligraphy - although beautiful, adds to the diffuculty of reading this. I had to get a magnifying glass out to read some of it. It's a shame such a beautiful book was published with such small type."
4,The Pen IS Mightier Than the Sword,"He says all the right things, but does he look good on paper?? That's the question I asked myself after reading ""Mr. Write."" How could I (how could anyone) resist the temptation to find out using the well-written, clear and insightful analyses provided by Ms. East. Intelligent, witty and sometimes disturbing, Ms. East shows us how cryptology reveals a person's personality through the simple act of writing a note and how anyone can can apply those theories. In addition, she provides easy to understand examples. So, if you're wondering if he's as good as he seems, or too good to be true. Is he kind, open, generous and straightforward or critical, controlling and deceitful? Find out for yourself. By the way, I did. Fortunately, I learned enough to to confirm what I already knew, which was, that while the gentleman in question may not be Mr. Right, he's perfectly suited for Mr. Right Now!! So I'm keeping pen and paper handy while my search continues."
4,Finding Mr. Write,"This book is quite unlike your typically self-help books. It provides the reader with a 'slant'on the intricacies of finding a mate. The best thing about the book is that the reader can use it to improve their own personal characteristics AND see if that significant other is really the one for you.Although the art of graphology is quite new to me, I found the book quite interesting. Also this is an easy read for those of us with little to no time for leisure reading. You can choose the 'hour' of your choice for traits you find the most important in a relationship.As far as validity of the science of graphology, I'm totally not bought on it yet. After I recieve my in-depth analysis from Ms. East then I'll make judgement. Until then, I think Ms. East succeeded in creating an interesting, thought provoking tool to use for understanding why people act the way they do."
1,Dreadful - boring and unimaginative,"Granted, finding another Dickens would be highly unlikely in any era. Yet this horrid work not only is a far cry from Dickens but would be only mediocre were it written by a teenager who was trying to make points about 2002 political correctness, heavily flavoured by the American dream.I shall not repeat the points which other 'one star' reviewers made, and with which I heartily concur. The literary style is very poor, the rush of ghosts and their messages more irritating than enlightening, and Timothy Cratchit shows not a hint of the charm of which the original gave promise."
5,"Good book, but I thought it was different",See my review of the other edition of the book which was cheaper.
4,Goralski Help,This is a great little book which is must have if your are studying the Highlanders from the Tatra Mountain's area. They have there own way of describing certain things and usually it only takes one word most of the time. Now I understand why most people had a hard time understanding my father when he spoke in the old language of the Górale. This book has helped me in my genealogy research when those strange words appear ever so often.
4,review from a mw,"This joystick works nicely with the game mechwarrior 4 if you've used the recommended joystick (sidewinder precision pro) you may have noticed you might as well be controlling with the mouse! This joystick is best used primarily for turning and then use the mouse for torso, you pretty much could do whatever you want with it though. I've only used this joystick for mw4 so i don't know how it controls on other games. i would imagine it would work well seeing as it is such a steady joystick. an added bonus is it goes in the USB port so those of you out there w/o a joystick port, YOU ARE IN LUCK!"
3,"Decent joystick, software lacking","BOth this joystick and the software are very good, but very problematic. One time i was using my joystick, and i left for five minutes, and when i came back, the joystick was completely frozen and i needed to exchange for a new one. THis then happened again. When I tried to install on a different computer, the software does not work correctly. This is a good stick, but I wish I had just gone with a different one. Good design, poor execution."
2,"good joystick, horrid software","the joysticks overall sesign was good, good response, and i really liked the throttle and button placement. The reason im giving this 2 stars because of the horrible software. I run Xp,and once you get it running its fine. The problem starts when you shut your computer off. once you turn your computer back on and if you try to use the joystick, it won't register, and you need to uninstall and reinstall the joystick software all over! This happens every time you shut down your computer, and it gets very annoying."
4,Chicago Bear lover,"This joystick has performed fantastic! Halo is my primary game. I've read the rest of the reveiws, so I'm not going to duplicate what's already been added.The only drawback that I had with this product: If you game as hard as I do, be careful because the plastic in the trigger and the hand rest is a little less than sturdy. But then again, I have worn mine out!"
2,Too Little Real Meat,"I ordered this book with the false impression that there would be information on writing good sales letters and advertising copy. The book mainly contains ""canned"" headlines that you can adjust to your own ad. Once you get the headline, you're on your own.I wasn't impressed."
4,Good but worth reviewing to absorb more,I bought this book on Michael Hyatt's recommendation. It took me a while to get into it and even then I found it hard to apply to my current situation. There is quality material here but I just struggled to apply it to my current situation hence the advice to review which I am going to do in 6 months.
3,It's a Swipe File... And That's All...,"Look, this is a swipe file of advertising headlines, and that is basically it... there are a few chapters at the back that go into headlines, but nothing I wouldn't rate as higher than ""basic level"" information.On the front of the book, it says ""Bonus 2 Free CDs - $97 Value - Details Inside"". But I can't find any information about this offer anywhere inside the book... dissappointed, but I bought it thinking there weren't any bonuses anyway...Look, this books is OK and you'll get some good headlines for your swipe file, but I'd recommend the first few chapters of ""Tested Advertising Methods"" by John Caples ahead of this book any day. Caples provides far and away more info in those few chapters than you'll get in this entire book... and it's alot cheaper than this book as well!Or google the term ""advertising headlines""... you'll find the same headlines on a number of free websites... I just tried it and it worked!"
1,"A Waste Of Time and Money, And I Didn't Even Buy It!","I borrowed this book at the library, so it cost me the price of getting to the library (and having to go back to return it) but I am still upset about wasting the time I spent getting it and reading it. I don't usually write book reviews, but this one deserved time and energy to prevent others from wasting time and money on it. The few nuggets of helpful hints could have been posted in a short internet article, NOT a 130 page book.If you want to feel used, buy this book. If you want to know how to create those horrid internet ads that pop up on the screen and look like they will give you a virus if you go anywhere near it, buy this book. If you are creating a library of books that look like they can help make you successful, but they don't really do anything, buy this book.Otherwise, stay far, far away!How come there isn't a zero star rating?!"
3,I can't give this a great review,I wish I could since it was recommended by Michael Hyatt in his book Platform (which is excellent). The book simply list a bunch of headlines and their variants that get attention. I was hoping for something that would describe the process of making headlines more effective. It's OK but don't expect any magic (IMO).
2,NOT ORIGINAL GROUP,"Not sure whose singing lead in this ""version"" of the gtoup but it could be Monroe Powell on some of the songs."
4,Ink Cartridge Purchase,The item that I ordered was delivered much faster than I expected and while I always get good results from Canon products I wish they would sell these cartridges without the ink tanks. That might make the price a little more reasonable.
5,A favorite at Christmas or at any time of the year,"I never tire of this music. Favorite tracks are the haunting ""Lament"" and ""Sails of Galway"". I played this CD for a Muslim coworker who was enchanted and wanted to introduce this music to her children."
5,Nothing Like a Celtic Christmas!,"It was a beautiful addition to my music collection. I enjoy Celtic music throughout the year, but this was an experience like no other."
4,Father loves it,I bought this for my dad that has a hard time bending over. This wors Great for picking up pecamn
3,Rolling Nut Gatherer,"It works okay-you have to empty often. As it gathers, the weight of the nuts will push them back out. It had one area where the coils were too far apart and all the pecans were falling out. I had to rig it with bread ties to brings the coils closer together. Doesn't work as well on small native pecans, but is still better than bending over or crawling around on your hands and knees to gather them."
3,roll a nut picker,"I will let you know in the fall/winter when the accorns fall from the trees. Where was this when I was totally walking on ball bearings (accorns) and when the shells are broken up by the squirrels, they stick in the pads of my dog's paws. I am only giving it 3 stars as I can't rate it yet but giving the looks and construction, it seems like it just might do a fine job. The squirrels won't like me but my dog will be forever grateful."
1,Burnt Offerings!,"These cookies obviously have good quality ingredients, but every cookie in every bag was burnt! And I'm not talking nicely browned. These were just this side of black on the bottom and extremely crisp as a result. Too bad. If not burnt I suspect they'd be really good. The manufacturers should have tossed the batch instead of peddling them to unsuspecting customers."
5,A Rocking Horse Catholic,"I have always enjoyed Houselander and this book is a account of her early life...she had to overcome abandonment by both of her parents at a young age, being sent to a French boarding school, and a shyness that prevented her from socializing with her peers. However, the download misfired and I had to keep my Kindle from switching to horizantal to vertical every 3 minutes and from large print to small. Reading the material was a challenge....perhaps you can correct this. Thank you, Joan Louise"
4,A Treat Worth Waiting For,"I've been waiting for a solo album from Dawn Robinson for a couple of years now. Though she has been involved with groups of talented singers, her vocals have always seemed to stand out from the rest. This album's release took a lot longer than I initially hoped it would, but it was worth the wait. My personal favorites are Set It Off(an instant favorite that will command repeated listens), Still(a tight rock-type track), Don't Give Up and Read It In Your Eyes. Those fans of Dawn's work with EnVogue and Lucy Pearl will pleased with this album because it is a combination of the two styles of music. But Dawn Robinson's sassy vocals and commanding style are what make this album distinct. I recommend this album and hopefully, you will enjoy it as much as I do."
2,a step beneath her,"if you like Destiny's Child, you'll think this CD is bootylicious. If you're like me and don't, then you'll probably think this CD is just plain booty.I love Dawn. I loved her with Lucy Pearl and although I was sad that didn't work out, I was looking fw to her solo album. I thought maybe she'd do that rocky kinda stuff that she does so well. Nope. Just formulaic pop.There are a few nice cuts on the CD, but for the most part, it's petty and immature. Everybody's jealous, everybody's hatin, blah, blah, blah. I guess she's right--I'm hatin. Hatin myself for buying this dayum CD."
2,Very Disappointed!,"In my opinion, the songs on this album are poorly written. It's almost insulting for someone with such vocal talent to sing such trash. Also, I don't think she's working up to her full potential. I don't doubt that she's talented enough to have a successful solo career, but this album is very disappointing. I if could, I would take it back to the store and get my money back. I'm really surprised. It's not like she's new to the business. She should know better!"
2,Average,"it's a [Darn] Shame when your first Song is the Major Highlight&that is the Case Here.Dawn has a Solid Voice but the Material Here only like 499 other Singers could do this Material.the funniest song here is ""Envious"" that Song is the kind of song that Michael Jackson might have Composed, problem is for Dawn Her Days in the MJ Limelight seem like a long time ago.nobody is tripping over Her Hit&Miss Musical Career since Her Days with En Vouge ended.Her Voice is tight but the Material is a Dime a Dozen&She Deserves Better."
3,"Nice, but she could've done better","This isnt a horrible disc, it's a disc that has no direction. Where are the superstar producers/writers? It would have been nice to see Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis or Dr. Dre guide Dawn in the right direction. Instead we're stuck with 90% filler and 2 decent tracks. ""Set it off"" and ""Still"" are the best tracks here, and if someone at Atlantic records has a brain, they'll enlist some brilliant remixers and get them on the radio. On the bright side she's got talent, staying power, and presence."
1,What Is This...,"I don't know about everyone else, but I thought that she was going to come with something. I have to admit the girl has a nice voice, but I'm sorry, but that's about all she has to offer. The CD was horrible and i was very disappointed. Better luck next time!"
1,WAAAAAAAAACK,this cd is so bad .. she needs to beg en vogue for her old job back. she really belongs in a group. she's not strong enough to be solo. ewwwwww WHY!!
3,Good Effort,"Admittedly, I was expecting the funk of EnVogue and Lucy Pearl, but this IS a solo project. Set It Off did set the CD off, but it dragged after that, until the last half of the CD, when the beat, vocals, and mood picked up. #8 Fed Up, through to #12 You Will Never, helped bring my rating up from 2 stars."
3,DAWN'S SOLO DEBUT IS OKAY,"Wow!! She did it. Dawn finally released her solo album after all these years. That is one of the reasons why she left En Vogue. Part of the deal while being a member of En Vogue is that she can release a solo album just like Terry Ellis did. I think this album is okay. Although she has a very powerful voice and I always thought she was the best singer of En Vogue, I think that some of her songs could've been a lot better not that they're bad. I heard on the last track how she's talking about En Vogue and Lucy Pearl. It's a funny thing because these days, you don't hear anything about Dawn, En Vogue or Lucy Pearl. The last I heard, Dawn was on tour doing a play with Johnny Gill. Overall, Dawn is talented singer and her album is okay."
2,Not very impressed,"Hey we all know that Dawn can sing, but maybe she needs to find people who can write songs. This C.D. was pretty boring and made me long for Envouge."
1,oak chest,"It took quite a bit of time to assemble, and after doing so the top of the chest doesn't close down properly as it should, it springs back up and stays open about 9 inches. It will be quite a frustrating experience to attempt to send it back. Would not recommend this particular style or brand."
4,Great toy chest,"Decent design focused on avoiding pinching kid fingers.After I assembled it, the lid would stay open about 1 inch, but this is actually really good since my toddler loves slamming things and he gets frustrated since he can't slam this toybox lid. :)This toybox also matches the other Storkcraft stuff pretty well. Has nice and convenient handles on the sides, and tray on top for stacking things on."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. SprayWay stainless steel cleaner is way less money and works way better than this. I was surprised that this was not only nothing special, but not even very good."
2,Not as promised,"This product leaves streaks on my stainless steel refrigerator. Disappointed, as most reviewers liked the product. Tried applying it with different types of clothes and in different ways but still not very successful."
2,No good,Good is not benefited them in the futureGood is not benefited them in the futureGood is not benefited them in the future
3,Adovia soap,"I can not give an opinion just yet because I have only used the soap for a few days. I might amplify my opinion after some more use. So far, no results."
4,Good enough,"As a psoriasis suffer with sensitive skin, I find this product to be good one. It lathers up good and does not stink. Must read the fine print and keep the suds out of your eyes otherwise it works fine."
5,Great for daugher's psoriasis,"This product really helps my daughter's psoriasis. Seems to reduce the red and itchy. Plus, there aren't many soaps out there you can use with psoriasis. It also has no bad odor."
3,"Great soap, but not a miracle worker.","My wife got me this soap in hopes that it would help my eczema flair ups on my face. The eczema comes and goes, so it's hard to tell if the soap is really working. Since starting using it about a year ago, I've been through ups and downs in the skin department. So as far as its eczema-healing properties, my research is inconclusive.This soap does however clean well and leave my skin feeling great. And my bar has lasted me a long time, even with regular use.I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, natural soap that may or may not help your skin."
2,Didn't work for my psoriasis,"I have psoriasis on parts of my body that never go away. I saw this soap had mostly all good reviews so I bought it. Well, it didn't work for me. I was only just a little less itchy but for that price I won't be getting it again, I will have to look for something else. It did however make my skin feel very clean after I used it. It seems like it worked for alot of people, but for someone with bad psoriasis, it doesn't seem that it will work."
4,Love this soap! . . . BUT WHAT'S WITH THE NEW PRICE?,"I love how this soap feels just barely exfoliating, but gentle enough to use every day, and leaves absolutely no residue on my skin. My skin feels sooooo clean and looks so good that I've even started going a few places without makeup. And it's on the cheaper side for good skin care. Definitely recommend.UPDATE 10/28/10: What the heck?! This soap used to cost $6.99 and now it's $25!!! I don't think so. I'll go back to Cetaphil.UPDATE 11/9/10: Now it's back to $7.99. That's more like it. Just be aware that Amazon has been toying with the prices on a lot of items lately. If an item becomes at all popular, they jack up the price . . . apparently until people complain."
4,Good product for washing your face,"It's been only three weeks since I started using this product, but I would say it's a good complement to your skin care products."
2,caused me to breakout,"So I recived this soap used it on my face and it feels great. The problem I'm having is that I used it on my body for the next couple days and have noticed Red spots on my legs and arms dunno if its from the soap or somthing else will update after more useAlso I use Dove Senstive skin and honestly It think that this soap dries out my skin on my body compared to the dove.* 5/1/12My whole back ,arms, upper legs have broken out in small red acne like sores =/ wish I could get a refund."
3,Adovia soap,"I got this item in a timely manner. It felt good on my skin, but I think I need to get more to continue the affect. My breakouts are still active, but not as much. I think the soap did help. I am going to get some more! and see if it heals my breakouts completely."
2,Tried but no improvement for me,"I tried this because of the good reviews, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. It felt good when I was soaping the affected areas, but there was no improvement. I think at this point my skin is too bad to be healed by anything short of perhaps biologicals, but I won't use them - too risky.Someone commented, requesting the number of times I used this product before throwing in the towel. I don't know how many times I used it, but I used up the entire bar of soap - so many, many times. Every time I showered I used this soap til it was gone. Unfortunately, the usual remedies haven't worked this time - not sunshine, corticosteroid products, etc... Unfortunately we're coming up on winter again, which is so harsh on skin anyway, but particularly those of us with skin ailments. Brrrrr......"
1,Waste of money,I had hopes this product would clear my acne but the product did absolutely nothing. I am very disappointed :(
1,not work at all,"Dry and not work. Do waste your money and it is not a cheap staff, i promise it is the last time i buy this soap."
2,Try Something Else,"This soap didn't really do anything spectacular. It's just like a normal bar of soap, except that it looks like the color of mud."
1,Not worth it,"I've tried everything when it comes to acne remedies. This is nothing special, I've used it for 2 months now and notice absolutely no difference."
1,My skin is worse now,"Wow -- I read so many glowing reviews about this soap, I was absolutely excited when I added it to my shopping cart. I used it for 2 months, and not only did it not help with my acne or excema, it actually made these problems worse. My skin feels bumpy and dry all over now -- it's like I've taken 3 steps back in my fight against bad skin. I am sure a lot of variables go into how a certain soap will affect any one person; this soap seems to work great for some, but it sure didn't work for me!"
1,Harsh soap,"At first my skin had a glow to it after using the soap. Then I began to notice that my pores were huge and I started to break out. It also left a film on my skin. I'm going to stick to my traditional black soap, its much cheaper and much better."
5,Works for me!,"I'm 29 and I've had acne since I turned 18. I suffer from large pores, blackheads and terrible breakouts. I've tried all kinds of soaps from bars to liquids and nothing has worked as well as Adovia. I follow up with their raw yellow shea butter and my skin has never looked better. It has a really rich lather and my face feels really soft afterwards! I would recommend only washing once every other day to start and then working up to once a day if needed. If you overdo it, your skin will get dry and break out more. I don't know what it is about this soap that my skin responds so well to, but as far as I'm concerned, it is a miracle!The price is a little steep, though for me, it is so much better than throwing my money away on expensive skin care systems that over-promise and do not deliver."
2,does nothing for acne.,it makes my skin soft. but thats about it. it does nothing for my acne and may have even made it worse. :( disappointed bc i really wanted this to work and it doesn't! I have used it for about 3 weeks and my skin has only gotten worse. i'm happy for those who got relief with this product but i didn't and neither did my boyfriend who suffers from psoriasis.
2,No results on acne,"I used this product for 1 month in hopes that is could treat my shoulder acne. Even with every day use, I noticed very little change in the amount of body acne I had. That said, I would not purchase this product as an acne treatment.However, the soap does make your skin feel very soft and smooth."
5,Adovia,"I purchased this as a gift for my sister. I'm hoping that in time it will regenerate back to what it used to look like because she has had some significant skin issues. Especially long ago when she did a lot of scratching. She says her skin is so soft now, I just want her to be happy! I was pretty surprised that this worked the first time she used it. She has eczema and have tried just about everything to get rid of it. I think this soap is really helping her."
4,Great soap,"This is a great soap that will leave your skin clean and smooth. I use it in the shower, especially on my face. You can definitely tell a difference when you look in the mirror. It takes good care of your skin!"
5,OMG,THIS SOAP WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN SO SOFT I NOW HAVE MY FAMILY USING IT.MY KIDS LOVE THIS SOAP AND THE MUD TO.IT MAKES YOUR CUTS HEAL FASTER AND CLEARS YOUR FACE UP AND ANY BODY ACNE YOU MAY HAVE.WE USE THIS SOAP EVERYDAY AND WE HAVE 6 PEOPLE IN ARE FAMILY.SHALOM
4,Lathers well.,"Very nice soap with good lather, and very mild. Have not used long enough to describe skin benefits, but am pleased thus far."
2,"Feels nice, did nothing for my acne","I have been using this for about 2 months now and have not seen any improvements in my acne, but my face is very soft. I have hormonal cystic acne and clogged pores. It didn't work for me, so i would not buy this again."
2,Expected More from this produce,"I have been using this soap for about four weeks and notice no difference in my skin, I still have problems with my break outs/acne. This is another product that did not live up to it's claims."
2,dried me out,I have very oily skin & this soap dried me out so that I was flaking. I couldn't get past that to see if it helped with my acne.
5,good soap,"I've been using this soap every morning and evening for three months, and now I can tell this is realy a good stuff for my skin which is of combination. It cleans thoroughly without drying the skin. Although I get a row of cleansers in the bathroom, this bar is my favorite!"
1,Almost five stars....,The product I like but the first time I bought it it was no more than $10 and now when I went to buy it again it's almost $20. Something is not right with that.
2,mysterious headaches,"Overall the soap is as advertised. It works okay, not a miracle cure though by any means.Here's the important thing to note--after I started using it, after I read the label, after I knew it said avoid eye area...It still must have managed to seep in there despite my best efforts.I did not use it around my eye area. I never even felt it go near my eyes but it must have managed to sneak in.It gave me the absolute nastiest headaches, dry eyes, light sensitivity, etc...not like mildly annoying either--like dehabilitating pain! After about 10 days of misery it occured to me that the soap was the likely culprit. It was."
2,Didn't really help Psoriasis...,"I had horrible psoriasis all over my face and a lot on parts of my body. I had been buying the black soup dudu osun and using it on my face with Shea butter as a moisturizer and it was working nicely to help reduce redness and flakiness. I saw this soap and read the reviews and thought I would give it a shot thinking maybe it might work better then the other soap. NOPE! It didn't do anything for me or my psoriasis. I just wanted to leave a review letting anyone who might be thinking about buying it for that reason. It didn't work for me, not saying it wont for you, just not me. I used it to wash my face with once to twice a day for a month (so it has a good thorough test) and no worky.."
2,No acne relief,It didn't do as I had hoped for my face and all the irritations and whiteheads that have arisen since turning 40. Still using it as a body soap and feeling as dry as ever.
3,Smells good... but not worth the money.,"Check out my video review of this soap below![...]Pros:1. The soap smells good! Don't worry, it's doesn't smell like mud. It smells like lemongrass.2. The soap lathers as well as regular soaps.3. The soap makes your skin feel clean. It doesn't leave a layer of lotion on your skin (like Dove products do), but it makes you feel thoroughly cleansed.Cons:1. The soap severely dried out the skin on my face.2. There are tiny sand particles in the soap. You can feel tiny pieces of sand while rubbing the soap against your skin. It isn't painful, but it feels... tingly. I wouldn't recommend rubbing the bar directly against your face. You should probably lather it in your hands first and then apply.3. It is VERY expensive! I purchased this product at a discount, and I definitely won't be purchasing it at $11 per bar."
1,Awful,Don't buy this expecting it to fix all your skin problems. I tried it out and it dried my skin horribly. Didn't help my skin at all.
1,Absolutely disappointed!,"After reading all the rave reviews about this product for people with atopic eczema, I decided to try it. To my dismay, I was absolutely disappointed. It did absolutely nothing for me - as a matter of fact, it made my skin dry whenever I bathed with it and after that, nothing. I think that it even made my skin worse."
4,Good Book but not the best book ever,"This book teaches you a lot, but the only problem is that the reviews at the end of each lesson only offer the answers to odd numbered questions. They say this is a great book for self learners but how are we supposed to know if we got the answer right or not."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY-NO SUBSTANCE AT ALL FOR THE EXAM,"Please do not waste your money into this book. Take the course from Villanova University, because of them i managed to pass it with no problem. I really regret buying this book it was a waste of money but more importantly a waste of time since I had to work during to the day and study at night. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ."
5,Sound (inlcuding bass) is very good,"I must admit that I haven't heard Bose, but I do own this product and it sounds great. Klipsch horn technology is fantastic and the comperable Bose product is more than twice as much $169 vs. $400. I am buying the next version (HG all in one) for my mother-in-law for Christmas and I know she will love it The bass on this unit is fine. The Bose may very well reproduce deep base better, but the overall frequency response of this system (especially mids and tweeter) is fantastic. You won't be disappointed. If you can afford the Bose without batting an eye then buy it, but this is a very nice product for less than half the price."
2,Spend more money and get it right,"I bought this product after reading countless reviews that there was no difference in sound quality between the Klipsch and the Bose. Sorry to say for both my time and wallet that is simply not the case. This speaker while significantly cheaper that the bose (i bought this for $119.28) is not in the league as the Bose. My brother and sister both have the Bose speaker so I've heard theirs many times. My problem with thew Klipsch is that it lacks bass VERY badly. I've read the reviews about the memory volume problems and found that its really no problem at all. If you like quality sound the bose is worth the extra money sadly i'm packing this up after I write this and ordering the bose. (my girlfriend is none too happy as we're not going out to dinner tonight, but you have to give up something to get the quality of sound people should have."
3,Does NOT work with new iPods - call Klipsch,"The description is not correct in saying it supports all iPods. In reality it only powers the 1st and 2nd gen iPods. After getting it home and plugging my new iPod Nano only to see a message pop up saying the unit can't power it did I do research online (from Apple and Klipsch). I found the answer to the problem in several places. Apple changed how the power is delivered from the connector and so newer iPods will not charge through these speakers. This is a known problem and is on the Klipsch website but this description was not updated. I called Klipsch and they say they told Amazon but the description was not changed. I wasted $$ on this and can't return it although it's Amazon's error not mine or Klipsch. Aren't we suppose to trust these descriptions? I won't do that again, I'll call the manufacturer first."
1,Gone Too Soon,"Purchased on 29th January 2006 and put to work on the 12th February. This device worked tirelessly and effectively from its day of initiation. On 8th March 2006 it received its biggest job, reaching 85% of its 1GB capacity. After delivering its payload for its owner that day it retired for the day. When called upon on 9th March 2006 it was discovered to be non-functional.It leaves to mourn its once very proud owner.Also sadly missed by all who saw it, and marveled at its small size, large capacity and sleek, swing design."
4,Nice but a bit expensive,Good quality turtleneck t so sure. Fits nice feels nice looks nice. But at 33 bones it is a bit expensive I think
5,Sex ed101,"Funny, and enjoyable. Sex education for the shy people; with humor and good story telling; makes a good book to read and not make you blush too much!"
1,worst book ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Stupid humor,no plot ,and extremely boring!!!! 1 star. This book was utterly disappointing."
5,"Looks good, Works good. made my wallet happy.",These wires made the engine bay look a bit more custom than stock wires and they were a perfect fit and cost a lot less than OE wires. I would recommend them to anyone.
1,QUALITY OF MOVIE-VERY POOR,"The movie ""The Ring"" by Danielle Steele is a great one. But to enjoy it the quality that I received was very very poor."
5,Damm Good Movie!,"I myself an not a big fan of love stories, but I do like World War II. This movie does a great job of combining the two. The movie makes the characters so real that you forget it is just a movie. Must see for any WWII buff. Damm Good!"
3,Too many changes from the book,"I loved the book, the movie was ok, could have been a lot better. Too many deviations from the novel, I would have liked to see more of Kassandra's story in the beginning as well as Manfred and Ariana's love story.I liked the ending better in the movie however."
2,problems with dvd,"it was scratched , it wouldn`t play all the way through , it would freeze in certain parts of the movie"
1,Bad copy doesn't make movie enjoyable,This movie was so badly damaged the dvd player could not play it. After looking at it I noticed it was scratched beyond use. This should have never been allowed for purchase.
1,The Ring,I was never able to view The Ring as the DVD sent is apparently ome type of foreignDVD and would not play on any of myDVD players. So it was uselessd
3,The Ring,HelloI love this movie. But half way throught it keeps pausing. Then it gets through the problem. What do I do? I sure hope to hear from you. Thanks Roger
2,What the f**k?,"What can I say? This album (and we Ultraviolence fans have had to wait over three years for this!) promises so much, but completely fails to deliver. Despite a couple of fairly decent tracks, the album is mainly hard ""dance"" songs, with a lot of cheesy lyrics.After the I, DESTRUCTOR e.p, the brilliant LIFE OF DESTRUCTOR (the first album), the so-so PSYCHO DRAMA, the above-average SHOCKER (recorded under his Johnny Violent name) and the VERY good KILLING GOD, you would have expected something pretty special from Mr Violent. But I was so disappointed with SUPERPOWER. Where's the hardcore? Where's the, well, violence? And just when it seems that the music is going to finally get to the good stuff, the album ends! Very poor. I just hope that next time, he delivers his promise."
1,No way,"This album is music for wimps. Everything that made ULTRAVIOLENCE so great, is painfully absent from this turd of a release. If you are into wussy house music that fronts as hardcore and need some music for your lame Ecstasy trip, this'll do, if you really want to torture yourself."
2,Not very accurate routing,I am pretty disappointed with this product. I paid over $400 for a paperweight. The navigation/routing is not accurate. It takes you through tiny streets and dead ends. It routed me to a dead end while I was driving my 26 foot travel trailer. Try backing a 26 foot trailer for 100 feet. I wish that these companies would perfect their product before trying to rip us off!!! They refuse to refund their product.
2,Useless navigation software; Device itself is ok.,"Don't spend more than $150 on this device because the navigation software sucks. You will get lost. It sometimes has trouble pinpointing your location on the map. And even when it does it often directs you in circles. And one of the biggest flaws is that it cannot pronounce street names. Trust me, this is VERY important. Other navigation softwares do.The good thing is the device itself works well and it's NMEA compatible so it's not a total lost. So, after spending $350+ on Navman, I'm planning to shell out another $100 to $200 for another navigation software only package. I'm still evaluating which one to buy, but so far most of them are better than Navman. Even one of the least expensive one, Mapopolis, works better and it can pronounce street names."
4,easier to use this item w/laptop than have an extra gadget!,I have had a great experience with this product. It made a lot more sense for me to buy this lower cost item and use with the laptop I already own than to buy another gadget that might be out dated soon. My receiver works fine and all I have to worry about is updating the software in a a couple of years. What I really like is I can use this in any of our vehicles or rentals or even when traveling with friends. It just made a lot of sense for our uses.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM NAVMAN,"Navman products are horrible. Their customer service department is in the toilet. Beware and stay away from Navman.Also, they do not honor their own promises and products often arrive broken. You'll be asked to pay for the shipping of a new one and they will ask to recieve your broken one first before they send a new one - at your time and expense. You can fight this though."
1,Navman Run by Baboons in Rundown Zoo!,"Yes - it is true. A bunch of baboons decided to start a company from deep within the zoo walls. While smart enough to fool zoo keepers and officals, they were unsucessful at keeping customers happy.Their products are designed by a staff of donkeys. The Jackasses failed to develop a devied that could hold a position for any length of time.Don't send the baboonbs your money! Go to the zoo.... throw peanuts at them."
3,Almost hit the mark,"I know absolutely nothing about writing a movie treatment. Be aware, I am interested in writing a movie treatment NOT a full fledged script. So when I asked learned friends what book they suggested everyone named this one. I even asked for other references, everyone said this was THE book.The book does give great details on the content of a treatment, the necessary parts, and insight into the industry, however I was waaaay disappointed that a sample movie treatment was NOT provided. Had the sample been included this book would have gotten a 5 star rating.It would have been quite helpful to see a treatment dissected and the typing format!! Perhaps someone can email me a suggestion on a book that has the elements this book is missingTake care--"
5,A MUST for FIMLERS,This book is a gem. It was recommended by a fellow writer and it basically walked me through the process of writing the treatment for my novel. I look forward to using it again and again. It was informative and gave resources that are invaluable. They need to give seminars!
1,Waste of Money,"Ordered this book having already written a few treatments. I was just curious as to the author's definition of a ""treatment that sells"". Sadly, there are no examples of feature film treatments here; only a sample book adaptation treatment and a lengthy one for a television show. There's just a single chapter dedicated to writing a feature film treatment, and it consists of absolute writing basics (plot, character, point of view, etc) that anyone who's at the point of even considering writing a treatment should already know. The majority of the book focuses on television, with a few throwaway chapters about copyrighting and protecting your writing - all information that's freely available online. The Screenwriter's Bible (the FIRST book any aspiring screenwriter should purchase) covers all of this stuff in greater detail, and offers more ""real world"" examples. Don't waste your money."
5,Much needed information.,This book was needed for a project that I am working on and it was delivered very quickly. Thank you again.Amen Sterling
3,"useful information, but basic","The book was useful, but the service from Amazon was terrible! It took two weeks to deliver and they still delivered it somewhere else. Had to get a replacement. After all the wait, the book was surely not worth the headache."
5,Realities of selling your story,"A very insightful book thaty I will utilize to write my first treatment for a story idea I have based on the adaptation of a novel (Denying Liberty). I found the book very easy to read and to digest. It is not a ""cookbook"" for writting your treatment; but it does provide significant insight into the process - i.e. industry expectations, key elements to be included, objectives which the writer should consider."
3,Practical Advice perhaps slanted towards television movies,"Writing Treatments That Sell is a good book that offers practical advice as to what goes into a treatment because most new writers don't really understand the reasoning for a contents of a treatment. The authors have a wealth of experience over thirty years of combined experience in the various mediums that comprise the mystical abyss that is Hollywood, so they know what they are talking about and any advice they give should be taken seriously. But I felt rightly or wrongly that the book was slanted towards the television movie given the lengthy chapter that included a reasonably well detailed sample of a television bible. With that said though, much of the advice offered in the pages of Writing Treatments That Sell can be used no matter whether your writing a movie screenplay for television, movies, radio, or the emerging Internet media and is a valuable resource for anyone who's never written a treatment before."
3,Create then what????,"The book provided insightful ideas about how to craft movie and tv movie and series treatments (many of which I incorporated into my own treatment), and provided somewhat dated guidance about registration of the treatment and other protections with the Writers' Guild (you can now do it online), but fell dramatically short (sorry!) of providing insight as to how to market it."
5,A fantastic practical and inspiring text.,"""Writing treatments that sell"" is a must have for any new writer serious about entering the motion picture of Television Industry.This text gives specific information about the function of treatments and the industry standards for writing them. Save yourself months of work by writing your treatments first!""Writing treatments that sell"" is a great addition to my collection. Highly recommended!"
4,I miss the show!,I'm not really a big Jazz fan at all but after Melrose's final episode i decided to buy this Cd and i listen to the theme song every night. For all those mournful Melrose addicts out there i recomend this Cd because it might just bring back some of your favorite memories. That is if you can get past some of the bad songs!
4,"Ignore the TV tie in, and you've got a great CD","This is a CD I put in when I'm having company and want great background music. Once I got past the somewhat obnoxious Melrose Place cover, I dicovered a great collection of jazz."
5,good stuff,"i was a wedding dj, and this album had quite alot of good music for coctail hours and dinners. (except for ""love will bring you back""..not a wedding appropriate tune)i have found myself listening to i in my carits good stuff, mostly instrumental"
2,TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT,"IT WAS HARD, BUT I MANAGED TO READ THIS ENTIRE BOOK. IF I COULD JUST LET PATRICIA CORNWELL(MY FAVORITE AUTHOR) KNOW THAT WHAT MADE HER PREVIOUS BOOKS SO TERRIFIC WAS NOT ONLY HER WRITING STYLES BUT KAY SCARPETTA, PETE MARINO, AND LUCY. THEY WERE THE BEST TRIO THAT MONEY COULD BUY. I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR HORNET'S NEST BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT A SCARPETTA NOVEL. WE AS PC'S READERS HAVE GROWN TO LOVE AND ADMIRE SCARPETTA'S WORK. IF YOU HAVE READ ALL THE BOOKS INVOLVING SCARPETTA, YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT KAY, PETE, AND LUCY HAVE AGED, MATURED, AND GROWN RIGHT BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. I BEG PC TO NOT LET HER READER'S DOWN AND TO PLEASE BRING BACK SCARPETTA, MARINO, AND LUCY."
4,Wickedly Funny,"...I'm so glad I did. I liked the Hammer, West and Brazil characters very much in Hornet's Nest, and found all the characters in Southern Cross to be well-drawn, believable, and either very endearing or appropriately distasteful, yet intriguing.The whole story hinges on a series of increasingly funny miscommunications, which all collide at the climax near the end. There is only one scene of truly shocking violence, as opposed to the many you might find in a Kay Scarpetta story, and it's a very good example of the sheer wastefulness of most crimes.I'd say that the only slight drawback is the odd way the West/Brazil relationship is handled. Still, it's interesting, and I am looking forward to seeing what is in store for them next, in the new book about them, which is due out in October of this year. (2001)"
1,Is it a comedy?,"The characters were caricatures! Dig the names of the main players....Bubba Fluck (nicknamed Butt Fluck....yes...seriously!)Smudge (BF's friend), Smoke (gang leader), Weed(secret genius disguised as typical neglected kid), Dog, Sick, Divinity, Pigeon? And then the police officers....Hammer, West, Brazil....and what about the 2 lady cop's pets and the human qualities they took on? I couldn't quite figure out if this story was tongue in cheek or finger in throat. Anyway, the story just barely scraped together at the last chapter.....and then there were still frayed edges. I would say if you haven't started this book, move on...."
1,Couldn't put it down!,"I couldn't put this book down. I wanted to see just how BAD it would get. And I was not disappointed. The book didn't make sense. The conversations were stupid (all those ""ten"" codes) the plot ridiculous, and characters just kept popping up out of nowhere. I'm glad I bought the paperback. If I had bought the hard cover (like I usually do) I would have had to return it. IT WAS THAT BAD !"
1,"Most of the facts are wrong, proof-reader should be fired","The author should have bought Web-sites for Dummies as most of the computer stuff is completely wrong. Also there are many mistakes that the proof-reader should have corrected. Very little of the story ties together, as another reviewer mentions the attempts at humor just don't work. The complete bungling done by these supposed professional police earned them the resentment. I finished plowing through it as I was on an airplane and had run out of other things to read. Reading mindless trash on an airplane is OK, but this doesn't even make that grade."
1,Don't waste your money or your time!,"I wonder where in the world an editor was. I often find that well-known authors suffer from an apparent lack of strong editing. They need someone to knock them across the head and tell them just because they sell lots of books doesn't mean they don't need to rewrite and revise! There was only one character in this book that I felt had any depth at all and he was pretty one-dimensional. I really have enjoyed the Scarpetta series, so I was looking forward to an enjoyable read. But the thinking animals,whiny characters, and horrible language in this book were too much to handle. I didn't even finish it because I didn't care about the characters or the plot. This book isn't even worth checking out from the library."
1,Give me my MONEY BACK!,"I can't take this book back fast enough! I LOVE Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books--can't get enough of them. So I was really looking forward to this. Imagine my horror when I realized I had bought another book like Hornet's Nest! I made the mistake of forcing myself to finish that one, and I'm not going to do it again. WHAT WAS SHE THINKING when she wrote these? I don't require that she only write about Kay Scarpetta et al, even though I love those books; but this book is SO offensive, and its characters are SO ignorant--I couldn't care less about any of them. Not only that, I don't want to even pollute my mind with this drivel. The one star is only because they won't accept this review without a star. PLEASE, PATRICIA-- don't ever do this again! And GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!"
3,SOUTHERN CROSS------NEARLY A LOSS!!!,"This was very different from the Scarpetta books. It was not what I expected, from reading the fly page I thought it would be about cleaning up a police force with the good officers finally overcoming the bad ones. The book is really about a small time hood and his sorry gang. Smoke is the so called leader. He does very small crimes then he ends up killing and older lady. The last few pages describe how he is caught. To me it does not deal with cleaning up a police force. If you have read other Cornwell books I think you will be not like this one."
2,A disapointing effort,"Cornwell has written so many excellent books that I was disapointed after reading Southern Cross. People have said that they loved Southern Cross in some reviews but I suggest that they read Cornwell's earlier work and they will see that this is sub-par.It appears that the Phillip Morris cigarette compnay sponsored her to write this as she mentions the cigarette company more times than I care to mention.If you are a long time Cornwell fan you will feel let down after reading this book, if you are a first time reader, buy it, and then you will really love her earlier work."
2,A failed exercise....,".This book struck me as a failed attempt by Patricia Cornwell to publicly flex her literary muscles. She tries to write dialog like Elmore Leonard, and she takes every opportunity to show off her knowledge of minutiae regarding automobile mechanics and other things.Like the one that's in the book, this dog does not hunt.Her characters are all stereotypes; there is not one that is the least bit interesting or complex. The dialog is garbage. The story line is not believable; it is, however, predictable. The suspense is not suspenseful.I do believe that Patricia is a very smart, very capable woman. No doubt about that. I also believe she *could* be a good writer. She just needs to stop trying so hard to show off how smart and capable she is while imitating other writers.In short, I think she needs to find herself and come to peace with what she finds. Then maybe she'll write a good novel"
1,Disappointed,"After several tries, I could not finish this book. I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's previous books and expected some continuation of her captivating Scarpetta series. This book seemed like she was working in another direction, many directions, but perhaps I didn't hang in there long enough to see it pulled together. It is rare than I do not finish a book I begin. If this would have been the first Cornwell book I read, it would definitely have been the last. I eagerly await the release of Cornwell's new books, but this one was a real disappointment."
1,Not her best work,"Unfortunately Corwell is not up to her usual high standard with this book. The characters seem unfeeling and morose, and the plot was thin. It seems to me that this series has hit a definite road block and needs to be re-thunk (sp ?). I have enjoyed every other book corwell has written and will buy others she writes in the future, I just feel this particular book was a waste of time to read."
2,not her best,I just finished reading this book and was glad when I was through. It was slow and even boring in some parts. Nothing even happened until the book was 3/4 finished. I only finished the book because I wanted to see if the killer was caught. I have read all of her books and this one was at the botton of the list. I was very disapointed in this book. Not worth reading.
1,A subpar effort from Cornwell,"A fan of Cornwell's earlier works, I was greatly disappointed. This book is bad, plain and simple. Don't even think about reading it. It's another example of how successful authors put in less work with each successive book. VERY BAD!"
1,"Lousey, awful, terrible, stinks...","I was going to write a review but I see others have said it all. Did anyone mention half the book was list of things (guns, tools, exercises etc.)She gave us names of things without ever giving the feeling she knew what she was talking about."
3,Black Humor,"From some of the other reviews it seems that some people just don't have a sense of humor. The book is not her usually writting, instead of a serious serial killer story, expect a dark comedy. She takes a pot shot at everybody and hits the nail on the head every time. The most important lesson to be learned from this book is that there are too many people out there hearing things that haven't been said and others who do not pay attention at all. The narrative gets a little disjointed at times. But the cast of characters are tied together in the end. On the serious side, there is a teenage gang leader and the kids he scares into the gang. One note: though very cute, I usually only like talking animals in fantasy novels."
2,Fire the technical adviser,"I liked the satire and comedy. I even liked the talking pets. I did have a difficult time swallowing the explantion of the Web site that was the foundation of the ""fishteria"" scare in this book. The parts of a Web address (URL) do not specify ""gateways"" that relay requests to a site, nor do Web sites execute screensavers on client machines. If this particular technical scenario is so wrong, have I been mislead about the details of the Scarpetta post mortums?"
1,Where is the REAL Patricia Cornwell?,Very disappointing book! I could barely finish it and am such a big fan of Patricia Cornwell.
1,disappointing!,"This is my first Cornwell book and I am strictly disappointed. Although I am only half way through of it, I feel that I cannot go on reading it anymore because of the weak plot of the story. There are several story lines in the book, which don't seem to have connection to each other. The more chapters of this book I read, the more I get confused. Lucky that I got this book with a discount."
2,"Disjointed and Decidedly ""UnCornwellian""","I have read the Kay Scarpetta novels and loved them. This book is clearly not up to Cornwell's usual standards. For most of the book I kept wondering how in the world she was going to bring together the disjointed story lines involving the various characters. In the end, the wait wasn't worth it. The line involving the computer virus was totally contrived and nonsensical, and only served to add to the general sense of chaos of the book. I was left with a feeling of having gone on a long and winding journey, only to arrive at a place I didn't want to be."
1,Missing continuity,"I read the entire book although I couldn't see what all these side stories had to do with one another....after finishing it, I still couldn't see a good connection. I was extremely disappointed in this book."
1,Complete waste of time,"I borrowed the audio book from a friend.If it had been mine, I'd of thrown it out the window of my car upon completion. Stupid plot, horrible ending."
1,Disappointing,"I've read all of Patricia D. Cornwell books, and this one is the most disappointing. A contrived plot that does not flow well. Characters that appear constructed rather than existing. It seems the book was written to meet some sort of deadline rather than carefully conceived, developed and finalized."
1,Unfinished outline?,"Did Ms. Cornwell have an outline for a book, and suddenly have a publication date? To meet the date did she then fill in parts of the outline, and decide to let the reader fill in the gaping holes? Did she start to develop some of the characters, and then get as disinterested in them as this reader did? How else do you explain this waste of time and money of anyone who attempts to read this hodgepodge of plots and characters? A very dissatisfying experience."
1,Sorely disappointed...,"I was very excited when I purchased this book. What a waste of money! I am an avid Patricia Cornwall fan (not just Kay Scarpetta) but this pushed my loyalty to the limit! Uninteresting characters, ridiculous animal pranks, useless cursing, etc., etc., etc. I'm struggling through to the end. I have approximately 30 pages to go and would give up now but I'm curious to see how she's going to end this debacle."
2,Not up to her usual standards,"Patricia Cornwell is not up to her usual standards in Southern Cross. Her characters are shallow, so the reader doesn't get to know them. Unfortunately the reader also has no desire to know the characters or even like them. The plot and story line are too contrived and don't pull you in. I trudged through this book believing it would get better. The end has no suspense, it's something that a high school Freshman would contrive for a short story assignment. (I know I teach high school.) As for the pet angle, leave it to Lillian Jackson Braun who does a much better job. You'll be better off to stick to reading books in the Kay Scarpetta series. They are witty, with interesting characters you like knowing, and the suspense will keep you up reading all night."
1,How did this ever make NY Times #1?,"Pets that type on the computer & arrange the love lives of their owners. Dialogue that comes from another planet. If you like these things, you'll love this book"
1,Not worth your money,I usually enjoy Ms Cornwell's stories (Scarpetta is OK) but this book was really bad. The plot is thinner than ice and the dialouge is extremely halting and ludicrous most of the time. Save your money. Don't buy this book.
1,A real disappointment,"The premise is good...crack team moves to change the culture and operations of a new city. However...the cutesy thinking animals (smarter than their owners and attempting to communicate), poorly fleshed out characters, and flimsy plot make this a disappointment."
1,"Don't bother, read something else.","I'm a big Cornwell fan, but this book was terrible. Not because it wasn't a Kay Scarpetta novel (I liked ""Hornets Nest), it was just bad. Cornwell usually writes convincing novels. This one was just ridiculous. Pets that can think and reason about their owner's behavior? Give me a break. Also, the passages of the character that spoke in broken english were so annoying, that I just skimmed over them. I haven't read ""Black Notice"" yet, but hopefully Cornwell has gotten back to reality. Don't waste your time with this one. I'm sorry that I did."
1,Cornwell phoned this one in.,"Disappointing. Cornwell hit one out of the park with ""Hornet's Nest"" and I was hoping for a repeat performance. She set a great foundation for a new series with Judy Hammer, but this book isn't it. Weak plot, weaker characters and sub-plots that add nothing to the story."
3,Better than Hornet's Nest,"A diehard Scarpetta fan, it's hard to switch to the new series. However, Southern Cross has the makings of a good read....once you get past seven chapters of gutter talk. Patience and faith on Cornwell told me there would be a good story somewhere, but there was no good reason for the excessive foul language at the beginning. Once she was done with that nonsense, Southern Cross becomes a book Cornwell can be proud of. No it's not Scarpetta. A point which I bemoan. But Southern Cross has a good story that keeps the reader interested...if you can get past the early chapters."
3,Classic Cornwell,"As usual, Cornwell's character development is substantial while her plot leaves a bit to be desired. Her stories focus on the relatively shallow lives of her characters rather than the potential storyline. Clearly, Cornwell should shift her focus to developing her brilliant plot ideas in lieu of continually trying to expand new characters."
3,Not As Bad As Everyone Else Says,"While this book might not be up to her usually Scarpetta series, I still enjoyed it. It's a nice change to not have someone whining so much -- her lead characters seem to have a ""real"" aspect to them. And what a name ""Butt Fluck"" -- had me laughing out loud!It's sad to see so many people bash a non-series book -- maybe they are afraid that she won't bring back the Scarpetta series if her non-series books are not well received? Let the author experiment a little with other writing styles so as not to grow stagnet with one set of characters.Anyways, if your not totally devoted to the Scarpetta series you should enjoy this one."
2,"uncharacteristic, slow-starting comic opera","I almost didn't make it past the pair of pets who narrate their own thoughts (in English, yet). Patricia Cornwell had not given us prior clues she is prone to such silliness. I also found the characters drawn so compellingly in ""Hornet's Nest"" -- Hammer, Brazil and West -- almost as silly this time around, as they seem mostly to lack self-confidence, scheme to belittle each other and rely more on serendipity than organized deduction to solve seemingly petty ""crimes"" until seriousness finally appears in the second half of the book. It's the second half -- quick-paced, at least, and filled with actual police work -- that saves this story from disaster. Either Cornwell has a new sub-standard editor or is resting on her laurels. Every previous attempt has been better than this."
2,Not nearly as good as a Kay Scarpetta!!!,"This Cornwell was a real letdown. Even the strong female characters and the great ""pet dialogue"" couldn't save this one. Ms. Cornwell, go back to Kay Scarpetta and recreate the forensics thriller for which you are so well known. Hammer's a good character. Charlotte's okay. But we don't need any more Southern Police Department escapades."
1,Cornwell has lost the plot,"Cornwell's writing is often unever, some of her novels great, others ordinary but this one is the worst. The plot is convoluted, unnecesarily so, and the characters uninteresting and unpleasant. It's the sort of book which makes you wish you had not bought it and which takes an effort of will to continue reading it."
2,Disappointing and difficult to read.,"As an avid Cornwell fan, and one who eagerly awaits each new release, I am terribly disapointed in Southern Cross. At times I become annoyed and bored with the listing of product names and chains. Its as if PC is trying to fill up space and has simply run out of things to write about. And, really, the thoughts of cats and dogs written into the story line is just too much. None of the characters are likeable or even very interesting. Maybe PC needs to bring back Scarpetta and Marino."
1,Cornwell has lost me as a reader. She doesn't seem to care.,"Shame on PC for this tiresome book. Lo, how the mighty have fallen! I'll probably not read her again."
1,The book does not hold your interest.,"Had this been Ms. Cornwell's first book, I would not have read another one. The story line is not interesting and she has not developed a character you feel connected to. I very much miss Kay Scarpetta."
1,one of patricia cornwells worst .glad it was free for me.,I just can't believe she wrote this.My fifteen year could do better. A big disappointment. Hope she reads these reviews. Please go back to Dr. Kay.
1,This was her worst. Jumbled. Mixed up. Pointless.,I can't believe Patricia Cornwell could write such a messed up book. Useless pages of useless characters. The point of the story was somehow lost in this jumble of words. Get back to Scarpetti. This follow-up to the Hornets Nest is not worth reading.
1,"I felt like ""The Little engine that could"", trying to finish","I anxiously purchased this book, anticipating another wonderful immersion into the world of Kay, her friends and her family. Instead I met characters called, Brazil, Hammer, West, Fluck, Cheddar, Bubba, Weed, Bean, Noble, Hanger, Pretty, Fling, Cloud.. do you see where I am heading with this? Their names were straight off of the top of her head, no depth no meaning, something from the Webster's dictionary. I only wish the story that resulted from this mishmash was as entertaining as good old Webster. Please Patricia, get back to your roots and refund our money. We have been rooked!!!"
1,not up to par,I could not get into this storyline. usually read one of your books in 2 or 3 nights. this one took mew 2 weeks.
1,a real disappointment,"To be honest, this is one of those books which I have to struggle through every line and every page, and reading Cornwell has never been this painful. The plots are not as rich, the writing not as engaging as she was doing Scarpetta and Wesley. Cornwell has every reason to try something new but this, I am afraid, is absolutely a venture on the wrong note. Maybe I am wrong- I gave up reading halfway."
1,a pretty poor book,"Ms. Cornwell should either go back to writing Kay Scarpetta books, or if she has exhausted her possibilities there, retire and enjoy her millions.This is an awful book. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,"A stupid, ""I hate Richmond"" book.","Cornwell's worst book. It moves the Charlotte crowd to Richmond without doing anything more with these characters. There is little plot but much vicious attack on Richmond, on fat people, on ""Bubbas."" Good satire is carried by plot. This is not good satire; it is just mean. Don't bother to read it--and certainly don't buy it."
3,Different,"After reading the reviews I almost didn't read the book. I have to admit though; I enjoyed it. It is not Patricia Cornwell's usual type of writing, but it is still worth reading. This book has a little of everything, suspense, romance, and most of all humor. I especially like the part where Passman had her showdown with Rhoad."
1,Southern Cross To Bear,"This book was so bad - it could achieve some type of cult status. Thank goodness, at the eleventh hour, she came up with that Azalea Parade and those wonderfully shallow manipulations that resulted in every character known to man being in attendance. Avoid this book at all costs, unless you are teaching writing by exposing students to bad literature."
2,Did Patricia Cornwell really write this book?,"I was very disappointed in Southern Cross...definitely not up to Cornwell's standards. I kept reading hoping that all the disjointed stories would start clicking together...which they did on about the last page! If you are a Cornwell fan, I would just pass this one up. Either someone wrote it for her, or she's beginning to fall into the write-what-sells trap."
2,Very childish one - shame on Ms. Cornwell,The book is way too stupid - it is neither a detective story nor some action thriller; just bits of something and no connection between em.Don't waste your time and money - better buy some Kay Scarpetta mystery !
1,No desire to finish this book...,"I have never stopped reading a book in the middle before and I was so hesitant to do so in this case. However, I am finding it arduous to even read one more page. This is my second attempt at this book, getting much further this time. Unfortunately, Ms. Cornwell can't keep me interested with her characterization or her non-existent plotline."
1,The worst book I have ever read.,"Southern Cross has to be the worst book I have ever read. The story went around in circles and never amounted to anything worth my time. As I read, I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. Ms. Cornwell would be better served by forgetting about this series."
1,I thought she knew better,"Being a huge fan of Mrs. Cornwell's novels, I thougth she had learned her lesson with Hornet's Nest - her readers didn't care for those characters - they're incompetent and there was no there, there. Unfortunately, she only delayed the wait for a true Cornwell novel - the one with Scarpetta, Lucy and Marino in it. Please, bring them back - I really miss them."
1,"Poorly done, a real step down","After reading all of her previous works, I believe that this one was slapped together to meet a deadline. It lacks the characterization and thoughtful plot development Cornwall usually presents. Do yourself a favor - wait for the next Scarpetta novel and avoid this one entirely."
2,a disappointment and not up to smooth flowing of other books,"as far as i am concerned,the only redeeming quality of the book was popeye the boston terrier."
1,OH MY GOD!!!!!!!,"People listen to me.... PLEASE !!!! This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Cornwell has written a book that lack everything that the english language demands. Do not, I repeat DO NOT buy this book. You will do better sending the money that you would spend on this book to your favorite charity."
1,Did not like it at all,"Have always enjoyed Particia Cromwells books until this one. Too many charaters, rather confusing. No real suspense to it. Characters are rather blaw except maybe Weed. Romance with Bazil and Virgina is nothing you can relate to. Story is to wordy and jumps around to much."
1,What a disappointment!,"One of the few books I've read that I almost didn't finish. I read it all, but found no improvement by the end. Scheming animals??"
4,Southern Cross is right-on!,"Southern Cross is a refreshing change from the increasingly-dark Scarpetta series. The book is infused with light absurdity that relaxes you. The action is still there, and the interplay between the three main characters, West, Hammer, and Brazil, is very interesting. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series, as well as the next Scarpetta."
1,WHAT EVER HAPPENED???,"This book is not even close to the quality that Ms. Cornwell usually writes in. What in the world happened? The stories were all disjointed and hard to follow. Most of all, I just couldn't get to know the characters too well. In her Scarpetta books, Ms Cornwell really lets you get to know her characters well and admire them. But I couldn't get to like Hammer at all. To me the writing just kept on jumping from one thing to the other that there wasn't enough time to get to know her. I also think that the way West and Brazil were presented was superficial as well.My recommendation- AVOID THIS BOOK! This is Ms. Cornwell's worst book yet.Hopefully her next one will be better."
1,A Very Poorly Written Book!!!!,"I am an avid fan of hers, I am sorely disappointed and hope she reads these reviews and gets her act together, I had to at some points in the book, look at the cover and tell myself it was really Patricia Cornwells name on the front! It was a HUGE disappointment!!!!!"
3,"Not bad, but not up to the last one","Perhaps I had too high expectations of the second book in this series, since the first one one left me weeping with laughter, but I was disappaointed. Not enough of the Chief and her cohort; too much dreary reality. But Cornwell never writes a BAD book; compared to others in the field, this is still GOOD."
1,"Money best spent elsewhere, a big DISAPOINTMENT","This had to be the worst book that she has written. I'm a big fan of Dr.Kay, I read hornets nest and was satisfied, but this was a loosely put toghther book to say the least. It left you wondering who wrote this sorry excuse of a book, it did nothing for me. Hate to say this but you cheated your fans with one."
1,i wish i could've given this book 0 stars...,"while i usually love P.C.'s books, i absolutely hated this one. it dragged, it read painfully, i'm amazed that i finished it. i tried to sell it at a used book store, but the clerk refused to buy it, he said he'd heard it was so bad. please, pat, give us more Kay, Pete, and Lucy. Give us a lot more Lucy!"
3,A book to hate or not?,"I was really split on this book. On the one hand, it was a vast improvement over Hornet's Nest which always struck me as a first novel that they tried to cash in on after Cornwell established herself.This one brings back the characters from Hornet's Nest, but quits trying so dang hard to be serious. Also gone is Cornwell's paranoia, which believe me, is a welcome omission.I really enjoyed the humor, and the wildly exaggerated characterizations. Only problem is that the book had no beginning or end. It was all just middle. Plot also seemed optional.I guess the thing that surprised me the most was how much everyone else hated the book. It's not a good book, but it isn't a bad one, either."
1,DRECK & DRIVEL,What was the author thinking? How did the editor allow this mess? You think even the typesetter would have disassociated himself with this blatent mass market rip off. Please....dogs and cats giving the play by play of their masters' actions? A cat dialing a phone to try to reconnect two lovers. GAGGGGGGGGGGG. Where is Kay when we needed her? She could have chopped this book to pieces with her scapel and band saw.
1,I want my money back too!,Dreadful - I forced myself to finish it and am still unsure what it was about. The story line was so poor I continued waiting for another plot to develop - unfortunately it didn't. Do not waste your money or time on this.
2,Not my favorite Cornwell read,This one misses the mark for me. Try another like the Body Farm to enjoy this talented writer. From Potter's Field was also a good read.
1,This book needs a medical examiner!!!!,"Although my shelves are lined with Cornwell's book, Southern Cross will immediately find its way to the used book store. How many characters need a point of view? And apparently, Cornwell believes the dogs and cats in this book need one too -- maybe because her human characters have nothing interesting to say. I fully understand the need for an author to ""break out"" periodically and follow a new avenue -- but this ""avenue"" is full of pot holes, leaving this reader to wonder who really wrote this book and why it was published. Books like this can make a reader distrust a favorite writer's future work, so, come on Patricia -- write another of your great suspenses to help me forget I spent $25 for this."
1,Where is the suspense...?,This book is a fall from the standard we expect from this author. Where is the suspense and who thought up this wacky computer scheme? What is next...does West and company make it a threesome?
1,I Stopped Reading this Halfway Through,"I stopped reading this halfway through when I figured out nothing was happening either plotwise or characterwise. Too much like the author is trying to imitate Elmore Leonard or Hiassen. The previous book by Patricia Cornwall was disappointing as well. It just ended very abruptly. I'm not sure what's going on here -- too much time spending research? Or maybe Ms. Cornwall, now that she is rich and famous, is rejecting some good editing or her editors are now too intimidated to insist on changes. Whatever it is, I will not be buying more."
1,"Disappointing, shallow, lacked usual finesse and style","After having read every Cornwell book except one, I feel this was the most shallow and flimsy book she has written. I only finished the book because I never leave a book not finished. I was disappointed in the Brazil-West aspect, and in their previous story, they were much more viable and likable. The character development was thin, if almost nonexistent. This book left me wondering if I will read anymore of Cornwell's books."
2,Wish it had been better....bit of a disappointment,"I am a huge fan of Patricia Cromwell, and understand her wanted to expand other than Kay Scarpetta/Lucy novels, although I like others can't wait until the next novel comes out about them. This book was not up to Ms. Cromwell's standards, and hard to stay focused on. But, I will still remain a loyal fan and continue to read her books."
4,Her Best Effort in Years,"I have been a Cornwell fan since the beginning, but the Scarpetta series is wearing on me. It's getting less plausible as the years go on. Really, how many times can you package all of the crimes of the world into such a neat package. Point of Origin was so ludicrous at the end that I vowed that I would not read any more of those books.Ok, so Hornet's Nest wasn't a whole lot better, I admit. But at least the characters were new, and you felt as though she had renewed joy in writing.So I was at the bookstore the other day, and I thought, I'll give this one last try. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least. Cornwell has taken these characters and filled them out in a nice story that has humor, drama, a nice mystery, and much more. If Cornwell's books are starting to wear a little thin on you, you ought to at least give this one a shot. It's worth the effort."
5,Loved it!,"I seem to be in a minority here. This is only the second book I've read by this author so I guess I came to it without any preconceptions about how her novels ""should"" be written. I found it funny as all get out and kept turning back to reread bits. Loved the English language mangler, laughed at, felt sorry for and identified sometimes with Bubbah. Ms. Cornwell has a real gift for observation and if you the reader, can lighten up a little, you may catch her gentle digs at the human condition."
1,rediculous,"i am skipping whole paragraphs just to finish it, hoping it will make sense...i have every cornwell book except Scarpettas' winter table.southern cross is a bomb of a book.if cornwell puts more energy into these characters than kay,marino, and that goofy lucy...then i am done with cornwell.i love cornwell books, but i hated Hornets Nest and Southern Cross.BUBBA-SUMDGE-SMOKE-WEED-MUSCRAT???oh please, give me a break. i lived in the south for 5 years and she is really type casting a bunch of fools.so long, cornwell,it's been nice.p.s.--in future scarpetta books, put lucy in a mental hospitol, for if she represents our lawenforcement mentality---then i'm moving to another part of the world..."
2,Back In Time,"I read the entire book without really understanding it until I read these reviews. I think the author needs to go back to Scarpetta and her friends, a much more believable and interesting group of characters."
3,Cornwell vs. Cornwall,"I am enjoying reading the Kay Scarpetta series, and I enjoy reading the reviews that people send in, but many people in the reviews I have read refer to her incorrectly as Patricia Cornwall. The correct spelling is Cornwell, I am not pointing this out to be rude, I just thought people might want to know the correct spelling of her name. Thanks."
1,Southern Cross,"This book is a waste of time. It serves only to glorify Cornwell's self-importance. She has a superiority complex and regales the reader with her never ending descriptions and lists of diverse subjects that range from guns to tools to food. It's offensive and completely lacks any kind of believability. Pick up something else to read, leave this one on the shelf."
1,Boring,"If this is an example of where the author intends to take her readers, then I think I will get off the train here. I have read all of Ms Cornwell's books to date and have rarely been disappointed. This one, even though the main characters are interesting enough, just has no oomph! I read and read and waited for the story to start, and read some more until I realized I was at the end of the book and still waiting. I will certainly read the next Patricia Cornwell book. I know it has to be better than this one."
1,Southern Cross,"I was very disappointed in this book. I love reading Patricia Cornwell and look forward to her next book. However, this was not up to her usual talent, and I really regretted reading the book. Most of all I regretted the money I spent on it."
1,CAN YOU SPELL BAD!,"What a horrible book. Plus, my version had so many grammatical errors, I couldn't believe it. How did this poorly written book ever get published. Did the author or the publisher ever hear of ""Spellcheck""? How about braincheck!In all fairness, I think Patricia Cornwell is a very good writer...I loved all her books up until this disaster!"
1,Simply not worth the effort...,"For those fans of Cornwell's brilliant Scarpetta series...i urge you to stay away from this book. This story doesn't evolve at all..just sort of plods along. The characters lack depth and the plot, well, I'm not even sure it makes sense. If it does make sense, it still is not interesting enough to make it even remotely worthwhile. Cornwell rarely disappoints, but falls flat here."
1,Baddddddddd!,One of the worst books I have ever read. Was a big fan of Patricia Cornwell. Everyone who bought this should get their money back!
1,Major Disappointment,I read Cornwell's Southern Cross with great anticipation. The reviews I had read were excellent--what a disappointment! The characters are one dimensional and uninteresting. Many of the characters had excellent potential if developed appropriately. This book could have been very good--but instead was a major disappointment.
2,Dinwiddie's Opinion,"Normally, I love Cornwell's books. After Hornet's Nest, which I loved, I was looking forward to the next....What a disappointment. I kept reading hoping it would get better. It finally got humorous and more interesting, but it wasn't worth the time I spent reading it when I could have read something else much better...."
1,The book was ruined on audio tape because of the new reader!,"From the first word on the recorded book, the new reader just ruins the book. I'm sure you'll get this message from hundreds--get C. J. Critt or at least someone whose voice is not dry, flat, dull, unemotional--it nearly put me to sleep. You can't concentrate on the text because of the voice!"
1,Horrid!,"I've read several Cornwell books and enjoyed most of them (not Hornet's Nest). Southern Cross, however, is just plain stupid. It came across as a cartoon -- you've seen them, the ones where the animals are smarter than their humans. The nicknames wore thin early on. Does everyone in Richmond have an idiotic nickname? I bet not. As someone a few reviews back said, ""It's not bad."" No, it's not; it's wretched. What happened to the idea of developing good plots? Some character worth latching onto? Has Patricia Cornwell been abducted by aliens?"
1,IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I WAS WONDERING, IS THIS REALLY PATRICIA CORNWELL, THE SAME AUTHOR THAT WROTE PAST GOOD BOOKS?? I HAD TO CONSTANTLY TRY TO KEEP MY FOCUS ON THIS BOOK, THINKING IT WOULD GET BETTER, BUT IT DIDN'T. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
1,A Big Disappointment!,"There was nothing ""right"" about this book. All of Cornwell's books left me looking forward to her next one! ""Southern Cross"" just never came together with a plot that would hold an adult's attention."
1,"Terrible, banal, unbelievable, unfunny","I quite enjoyed Hornet's Nest so looked forward to reading this. However I couldn't get into it - what little I read was appalling. No sense of character, reality, or story. It appears to be an attempt at humour but I didn't find it remotely funny. Quite banal."
2,Fair story line but bad editing by publisher.,The story line was only fair but I did finish the book in a couple of days--so something in it held my attention. The main complaint was the publisher's editing of the book. I honestly felt this was an illegal reproduction even though it was purchased at a major book store.
1,After 150 pages I put this one DOWN!,I usually thoroughly enjoy Patricia Cornwell's writing but this is horrible. I lived in Richmond for 10 years and do enjoy reading about the details of the city. What is up with these stupid cats?????
1,Down Hill All the Way,"This was a terrible disappointment. I expected much more from Cornwell. I like the Scarpetta novels, but a change is OK. Hornets Nest was different, was OK but not great. Writing in third party and using local language and misspelling are all right; however, this one had nothing to offer. The characters weren't developed, the plots (plural) seemed to go nowhere. It just wasn't interesting. The book sold on her name, not on value. I think this will make the next book harder to sell."
2,It Wasn't THAT Bad!,"I love the Kay Scarpetta novels, but it was fun seeing PC do something else for a change. Just as with actors, your work becomes ""type cast"" and you need to break free occasionally. I laughed a lot in this book from the sarcasm and situations, but I was glad to have it end. I wouldn't buy it again if I knew what I was getting."
1,Very Disappointing,I am very sorry that I bought this book for a long plane trip from Sydney to Singapore. This book is inane. There is more character development done for the pets than the main characters - and the pet angle is ridiculous. Even the most formulaic Kay Scarpetta book ( and the last few have been increasingly disappointing) looks like Dickens next to this poor excuse for a novel. Don't waste your time on this book. This product is shocking from an author who has previously produced such compelling characters and stories.
2,Not at all like any other book of hers I have read,This was a fairly entertaining book..I found it to be more on the line of a comedy than a mystery. It did not have the depth Cromwell's books usually have. The characters were not very well developed and the story lacked continuity.
1,"Unbearably lame ""satire"".","Couldn't finish this book. Not only Cornwell's worst book, but probably one of the most poorly written books ever released by a major publisher. What was she thinking?!"
1,This is dreadful,"Warning! This is a terrible disappointment of a book. I like Cornwell's work, but frankly found this book irritating in the extreme. Boring plot, boring characters, boring writing. And so twee - who cares what a character's cat thinks? Struggled half way and gave up - a first for me with this author. What a shame."
1,Definitely not her best.,"I felt she was writing this kind of tongue in cheek. I had the feeling the foul language she used was there just because she COULD use it. In some few instances it was necessary to develope a character, but most of the time it was needless. It definitely was a book I read because of the author (I truly enjoyed most of her Kay Scarpetta novels.) I certainly would never recommend it because of the plot. I hope she returns to the ME office."
2,"Tell the truth, Patty, did you really write this?","As I read Southern Cross, I found myself rechecking the book jacket to see if I was actually reading a Rita Mae Brown mystery. Dogs fixing computer glitches and cats using the telephone's speed dial are exactly what I would expect from Rita Mae but not from Patricia Cornwell.As I read doggedly on to the end, I realized that Patty is determined to show us her sense of humor. And show us she does with wit as subtle as a Mack truck and just as funny.All authors evolve---some not for the better."
1,A sad state of affairs,I read some of the over 100 reviews on this book. My conclusion was that enough was written to steer people away from this book. I then determined that it would make me feel better to agree that Southern Cross has little merit - it is stupid. I am one of those readers dying to have Scarpetta back.
1,A WASTE OF TIME TO READ,"This book read as if written by a child. Probably a child could have done a better job. A very poor excuse for a book. Cornwall can do much, much better."
2,We want Kay Scarpetta back!,"Unlike the characters in the Scarpetta series, these people just don't connect to anyone. The only one who comes near to connecting is the traveling police chief. However, having been married to a law enforcement officer for over 20 years, I know that even this senario is messed up! Either she's the absolute worst chief in the world, or she's just got wonderlust and that's not believeable."
1,A very poor effort on the author's part,"Hammer,West and Brazil were weak characters in Hornet's Nest and they hit a low not believed possible in this one. Winters Table,Southern Cross - be careful Ms. Cornwell ,three strikes and you will be out with me."
1,Boo! Hiss!,"Totally disappointing! I rarely do not finish a book I start, but this one was torture! I simply couldn't finish it. I wish Ms. Cornwell would get back to the style of some of her earlier publications such as Post Mortem, etc. I was so excited to see a new book by her and so let down with the finished product."
1,Pathetic just about sums it up,"I bought this book with excitement. I read Hornet's Nest and liked it. I wasn't expecting another Scarpetta story. This book was AWFUL. I found many instances where plot lines took a turn that couldn't be explained and then just went....nowhere. They were dropped completely! I have read every single book by Cromwell, but this was trash."
1,Worst book I've read in years.,"If you are into bodily functions and scruffy looking people, this book is for you. I read the entire book and felt cheated."
1,Definitely not at the same level as Kay Scarpetta novels,"Patricia Cornwell's Southern Cross does not include her famous character, Kay Scarpetta, who did not even make a cameo appearance to do an autopsy. Also absent along with Ms. Scarpetta are all of Ms. Cornwell's creative juices and excellent character and plot development. This novel is a real sleeper because all it will do is put you to sleep earlier than you had hoped."
1,Not worth the reading.,"Patricia had better stick to what made her so popular. This book was a waste of time in writing and reading. I have all of Patricia's books on the shelf except this one, and it will never go there."
2,Just Not There,"I think the biggest reason I was so disapointed was I was so looking forward to her next book. I was so dispointed what usually takes 4 days took 2 weeks. It just rambled on, I always seemed to know what was going to happen next and the killer didn't even die in the end. I wish these publishers didn't make a decent author write a damn book every 3 months. When they do this is what happens."
2,All fleshed out and nowhere to go...,"I'm a huge Cornwell fan, but this one does not hack it. Richmond is my hometown and I enjoy some of the references as to what street the character is on and what they see as they are passing, but enough is enough, does anyone really cares about so much detail. Her forte is definitely fleshing out charaters and making them live and she does that here but its like she spent 99.9% of the book fleshing out these (some of them great) characters but then the climax is a fizzle. Definitely not my favorite, though I hope she does bring these characters back. I especially liked the woman radio operator who went berserk and attacked the guy who gave her a parking ticket. My kind of gal."
1,Great cure for insomnia,"I literally have nothing positive to say about this book. The characters were grossly underdeveloped, the storyline was plodding and slow, and the ending was utterly predictable. It will take a rave review for me to ever spend money on Ms. Cornwell's work again."
1,Cornwell should stick to Kay Scarpeta!,Patricia Cornwell should stick to forensic science! This book is slow and seems disjointed. the characters have all the appeal of watching grass grow. i won't buy another unless it's about Scarpeta. why mess with a good thing. anyone i talk to can't stand it. her books are usually a treat to read; they shouldn't be a chore!
2,Only junk food when you needed meat & potatoes,"I was also disappointed in this novel. I do realize that authors must try different directions once in a while to remain fresh and explore their limits, but Southern Cross was filled with forgetable characters, a forgetable and fragmented plot, and a forgetable ending. I did find it humerous at times, but the whole book didn't quite make it into satire territory.As much as you don't want to, Ms. Cornwell, please return to Kay Scarpetta. We miss her and the excellent writing you did for her."
1,A disappointment from start to insufficient conclusion,"I am a huge Cornwell fan, and own all of her books - including Hornet's Nest. This outing is a true disappointment. The characters are ill defined, and completely unsympathetic. You simply don't care about them, their lives or their careers. The characters are sophomoric and immature. They bumble through the plot, and save the day by seat of the pants luck, not through skill or acumen. The plot revolves around divergent themes, that are never satisfactorily wrapped up. The book ends, leaving to many ends unexplained and completely without tie-in. Definately, not up to Cornwall standards. Don't waste your money on the hardback edition."
2,Don't waste your time on Southern Cross,I read the first 50 pages of Southern Cross hoping that it would grab my interest. Needless to say I have since returned it to the library unfinished. Hornets Nest was a very poor book but I read it till the finish wondering why I went to the trouble. Moving the cast of Hornets Nest on to a sequel was poor judgement. They are weak and the plot in the book is just as weak.Stick to your original series in which the characters have matured along with the plots.
2,Entertaining but lacks the suspense of her previous books.,"I couldn not believe I was reading a book by Patricia Cornwell! This book did not contain the mystery and suspense I enjoyed in her previous books. While the book was entertaining it was more light fiction than her usual murder mysteries. The author did depict the Richmond area quite accurately and she may hear about her ""Yankee viewpoint"" regarding her description of an old southern community. This viewpoint was what I enjoyed most about the book as I live 60 miles from Richmond and was not born in the south! I admit I found her descriptions to be very truthful and similiar to how I've perceived this area. The ""confederate cross"" is unfortunately still alive,well and very visible in this state."
2,"not usual patricia cornwell,what a disappointment","wanted to be the first to read this book and very disappointed. was written more tongue in cheek-not a serious mystery. i feel too much fun was made of richmond and the people who live there. i do not live there but would resent this story. ms cornwell should go back to her other style of writing, please."
1,FORCED MY WAY THROUGH 50 PAGES...,"I'VE READ THEM ALL WITH GREAT ENJOYMENT, BUT THIS ONE JUST WOULDN'T FLY. SCARPETTA CHARACTERS HAVE SUBSTANCE. THIS BOOK'S CHARACTERS GAVE YOU NOTHING TO BUILD ON. ABSOLUTELY LACKS INTEREST. A VERY LAME EFFORT FOR CORNWELL THAT WILL SADLY ADD TO HER WEALTH."
3,SOUTHERN CROSS(OVER),"Being a long time Patricia Cornwell fan, former Richmonder and MCV Trauma Nurse, I was disappointed not to find our beloved Kay. In an attempt to ""crossover"" her not so remarkable characters from HORNET""S NEST, P.C. falls below her audiences expectations with lack of character definition and plot but not humor. An enjoyable read if your not expecting the dynamics of Kay, Marino and Lucy."
1,Disappointed!!!,"I'd like to start this by saying that I'm a fan and am there to buy her books the minute they're available, and I was really looking forward to getting to know more about these new characters.. had enjoyed their arrival in her last book... but WAS SO DISAPPOINTED... it was never really developed and kind of ""I don't know"" what was she going for???... couldn't get into her story...did she read this before going to print and was she really satisfied with the completed work???"
1,Missed the mark,"Perhaps I've been spoiled by the Scarpetta novels, but I found Southern Cross to be greatly lacking. Under most circumstances, I read a Cornwell novel in one evening -- but not this time. However, it was a completely different type of novel and had it been written by any author other than Cornwell, I probably would not have bought it. From now on, I'll just wait for the next Scarpetta novel."
1,Disappointing,"While I am an avid dog lover, I couln't get into the talking/thinking pets. I found this book difficult to finish. Couldn't get into the characters, the plot (if there was one)was difficult for me to follow.If you are expecting anything like the Scarpetta series, don't bother."
1,I tried !,"I have to say I had read the many reviews of Southern Cross before I opened it up. I tried to enjoy it, but I could not. I am a fan of Patricia but I did not like this book. I never got into it. Shortly after starting the book, I wondered why am I struggling with this? I won't give up on Patricia though."
1,save your money,"I've read several of Patricia Cornwell's books and customarily enjoy them. Southern Cross, however, was a different story. As a police officer for the past 12 years, I can say that, from a police perspective, this book was childish, stereotypic, and, in general, poorly informed. No police chief in any major city actually works cases. Save your money for a well-researched book."
1,She just doesn't cut the mustard...,"I think it's fine when a writer tries something different. I think it's especially great when that writer discovers new avenues for personal creativity and reader involvement. But there's a problem with ""Southern Cross"". It is a juvenile and poorly written attempt. It's boring, and after the first few pages, it's repetitive and heavy-handed. Carl Hiaasen does it masterfully well, Patricia Cornwell has a long way to go before she gets a grip on humor and satire."
5,Great change of pace,"I really enjoyed this book. It's a great change of pace from superwoman Kay Scarpetta (although I really enjoy Kay's exploits as well). The characters have human foibles and mis-understandings abound. I especially have to feel for Bubba, the earnest, kind-hearted everyman with no luck at all and for Weed who maintains his integrety in spite of suffering loss, neglect and cruelty. I hope to see more in this series from Patricia Cornwell in the future"
2,No Bargain At Any Price,"I have enjoyed several of Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels, but found this story hard to finish. The story is implausible in just about every respect from beginning to end. The Richmond Police Chief, her deputy and their young assistant are brought in from Charlotte on a short-term (one-year????) federal grant to clean up the Richmond department. No way is that going to happen. They all freak out when a kid hacks in to the Richmond cops computer system - don't they have an IT department? Somehow, this invasion cripples police computers all over the world! The story reels to an absurd conclusion when the police and interested bystanders play 'dog pile on the rabbit' to stop the bad guy, but somehow the chief herself has to come to the rescue.A bad book ay any price."
2,Disappointing,"I love Cornwell's female protagonist, Kay Scarpetta, so I was hesitant to read Hornet's Nest. Could Cornwell create new characters as likeable and intriguing as Scarpetta et al? Hornet's Nest was interesting, a good read, but Southern Cross goes just a bit too far -- I found myself wondering if I was reading a serious crime novel or a spoof of a crime novel. The plot is a bit of a stretch, and overall, the book lacks a certain edge that Cornwell has consistently demonstrated in her Scarpetta novels."
2,We Already Know Whodunit,As a big fan of Patricia Cornwell I was really bummed out by this book. It reflected her usually obsessive attention to detail about some of the oddest things. I found myself reading lists of stuff that became downright boring (how cigarettes are made?). When I got to the end there was no surprise or twist -- the bad guy was the bad guy and did what bad guys do. Ho Hum. I won't spoil it for anyone else by saying what happens to the bad guy. The characters are likeable enough -- I liked them in Hornet's Nest even better. And what was that completely insane thing about the police dispatcher? I think maybe some of this story was written in a state of delerium... I am so glad that I got the book in a second hand bookstore.
2,Not vintage Cornwell at all!,"I was surprised to say the least at this book. I love Patricia Cornwell books and have read almost all of them, but I was not impressed by this one. Hammer, West, and Brazil, who were introduced in Hornet's Nest, lost their likability in this book. Also, where did she get these names -- like Butner Fluck? The names, like the characters, were stereotypical and kind of ridiculous. I am hoping that this was meant to be a farce of some sort. I will not stop reading Cornwell, but this is a black mark on an otherwise spotless record."
1,Very Disappointing,I have loved all of her other books. This one was very disappointing. I only keep reading because we have to pay so much for a book. It seemed like no one proof read it before it went into print?
1,Please Return To Kay Scarpetta!,"I ended up skipping 5 to 10 pages at a time just to see if the story was improving! The first 3/4 of the book were boring, weak and scattered. The characters were 1 dimensional (ok...Bubba was 2 dimensional) and the plot disolved with too many unnecessary sidetracks. What ever happened to introducing THE CRIME in the beginning and bringing us all along for the ride to SOLVING IT! I am a major Cornwell Fan, but this was a total waste of my precious reading time! Please return to the Coroner and all of the wonderful details of a well planned Murder Mystery!"
1,This book is a bomb,"This is one of the most poorly written on which I have ever wasted money. The characters are poorly developed, as is the ludicrously complicated plot. The title gives nothing to the story line and the three ""super cops"" as so ubiquitous and unbelievable as to be absurd. The author portrays animals as smarter than humans and interspaces a rambling story with seemingly obligatory blasphamy and a few sexual passages which offer nothing to the story. Frankly, if this is an example of Cornwell's work, I'll not buy another of her books."
1,Don't waste your time or money,This is absolutely the worst book I have read from this author. Did she write it or did a high school student write it for her?
1,TIES WITH HANNIBAL FOR THE WORST BOOK EVER!!,"I admit it - I did not finish this book, finding it pure, unadulterated crap. Whatever is Patricia Cornwall trying to prove? Her Scarpetta novels are wonderful - some better than others - but still good reads. This book was garbage - uninteresting, whining characters and a convoluted plot that was going nowhere. My copy was donated anonymously to the Middletown Library, which is more than I can say for Hannibal which was donated to the local garbage dump. I will continue to buy and read Cornwall's Scarpetta novels - I enjoyed Black Notice - but she can count me out when it comes to her other literary ventures. I should have learned my lesson when people told me that Hornet's Nest (a book I didn't read)stunk - but I figured I'd give the author a chance with her other non-Scarpetta novel.I should have saved my time and money."
1,Offensive,I have purchased all of Patricia Cornwell's books and this one is trash. If you remove the gutter words it would only be about three pages long.
2,REALLY DISAPPOINTING,"Such a disappointment. Not even in the same ballpark as the Scarpetta novels. It is quite evident that the Scarpetta series is something that Patricia Cornwell knows inside and out. However, this was not the case in Southern Cross. It was hokey and read clumsily (if that is a word) for about the first two thirds of the book. It is glaringly apparent that gangs are not Patricia's strong point and really should be left alone. I imagine she may get tired of Kay Scarpetta at times, but it is TRULY what she is a master of. I wait breathlessly for each new installment and am crushed when I run out of pages. Then I run to the bookstore to see if they have any idea when the next installment is going to be released. The thrill of the wait is never anticlimactic. Patricia - stick with what you know. It comes from your heart."
1,Total failure on every level,"As with Hornet's Nest, I bought this book without thinking to check whether or not it was a Scarpetta novel. Fool me twice, shame on me! The book fails on every possible level. It is not a good mystery, it is not a good police procedural, it is filled with woefully lame humor and, again as with Hornet's Nest, the anthropomorphism of various dogs and cats left me filled with despair at having once again counted, mistakenly, on the professional level of writing I had grown to expect from Cornwell's intelligent Scarpetta novels. These two non-Scarpetta books seem to be written by a different writer -- one who is less skillful on every level from plotline to character development. I will never again automatically buy one of this previously well-liked author's works."
1,What a waste of time - I could have had a root canal!!,"I seriously question if Patricia Cornwell actually wrote this book. This is as bad as anything I have ever read. The plotting was poor - who ever heard of two ladies, one assistant chief who hangs around with a clerk and the boss who doesn't do anything putting in a year to clean up a department because of reasons that were never quite clear. I really think there were several story lines here that Ms Cornwell never got going and I don't believe she actually finished writing her book, she just merely stopped. If Ms. Cornwell continues writing like this, I fear her reader base will decline. Enough said."
1,NOT WORTH THE STAR,"THIS BOOK SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!! I WOULDN'T MIND NEW CHARACTERS, I WOULD JUST LIKE SUSPENSE, I READ PC FOR SUSPENSE AND A GOOD MYSTERY, THIS HAD NEITHER. SHE HAS BEEN GOING DOWN HILL EVER SINCE SHE GOT BUSTED FOR STALKING JODY FOSTER TO PLAY SCARPETTA IN THE MOVIE VERSION."
1,Stick to Scarpetta,"I figured I'd give this book a fighting chance and read halfway through before I couldn't stand it any longer. As if the foul language wasn't bad enough, there were too many characters and not enough story. It should have at least seemed to be going somewhere, but it didn't. Was this Virginia or Arkansas? I've never met such a group of losers. Stick to Scarpetta; at least she makes sense and has a life."
1,Well beneath what Cromwell is capable of writing. no story!,"This book lacks a story line and a main character. It puts Richmond down and offends the people who have supported her all these years. A rank amateur could write a better book. This is far below her writing capabilities. I was very disappointed. She should stick to the Scarpetta story line. If you have a good thing going, why change?"
1,It doesn't deserve a star.,"This book should have been called ""How to write a book in 8 hours"". There is no way Patricia Cornwell could have given this poorly written, ridiculously-named characters, no plot, boring (need I go on) more than 8 hours of thought. The best thing about this book is that it is only 280 pages. The most action it has is reading the ""F---"" word at least three times per page, which I had enough of by the second chapter. I am very pleased that I received the book for free through my book club, otherwise I might have to write to her demanding my money back. She had better come up with better books in the future or she will lose fans. I will certainly think twice before I purchase another one of her books. Actually I will wait until my local library has it in so that I will not waste my money. Unfortunately, it will probably cost me my time."
1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL,Worst book I ever read. Pat must have taken a strong dislike to our southern city and some of the more affluent folk. Why else would she waste time having this junk published?
1,Totally unsophisticated writing attempt,"If this is Cornwell's sense of humor she should stay in the morgue with Kay Scarpetta. This is the WEIRDEST book I have read in a long time. Long stretches of painfully boring descriptions of pointless events and juvenile pranks ... lowbrow slapstick humor, suddenly interspersed with incredibly twisted moments of meanness. Bowels that keep emptying, in fear, or death, or bathroom humor. If not for the violence and language, I'd pass the book on to my 8-year old. He would probably think the book is hysterical, but I sure don't. I can't believe this writer is one of the most highly paid authors today. That's as revolting to me as all her defecation scenes. The whole book was an excuse for Cornwell's gee-it-was-funny-after-that-bottle-of-wine humor. The quality of writing is ruining Scarpetta for me."
4,"Not Cornwell's best, but better than most authors","Cornwell has done brilliant writing with her Kaye Scarpetta series and the characters in it. Unfortunately, while this book is a few steps above Hornet's Nest, it still does not meet her own standards. Worse, for those who, like myself, have trouble recalling names, the main characters are not powerfully enough developed for me to remember who they are (I loaned my copy to a friend). I hope Ms. Cornwell can get her skills back on track soon."
1,This is the worst book I have ever read!,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them. This book,however, was the worst book I have ever read. It was boring and unimaginative, to say the least. Don't bother reading it unless you are prepared to be dissappointed!"
