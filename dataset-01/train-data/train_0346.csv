5,GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD,"I truely love this doodad. I have no more peices of paper and a large daytimer laying around. Whatever I type is transferred to my laptop or desktop since it will partner to up to two pc's. The display is fine and I can write, play games and listen to music at the same time. Once I get the time to set up the modem and learn more about it I will probably give it TEN STARS. Buy this thing!"
4,Awesome Windows Pocket PC,"There will always be pro's vs con's on every pocket pc depending on what your exactly looking for it to do. My Jornada has an excellent screen, plenty of aftermarket software. Yes, the speed is not a screamer but I didn't exactly pay a screamer price (500+) I find the memory to be adequate as well. You can't go wrong with the Jornada 548. I looked at the compaq and agree that it's case is more like a toy and the casio well, its mostly proprietory software except for MS Word, Excel etc. It is not genuine outlook from what I saw on the screen shots."
2,Mediocre at best,"I bought this machine to use in a land surveying environment. My goal was to load CAD drawings on the machine and then use it to send construction staking information to the job site for my field surveying crews to use. I added a CAD program to it for transferring drawings, but the whole process was not successful at all.First, the program and the machine would not handle the drawings. It was slow and got hung up all the time.Second, you simply could not see the screen in the open. I reset the contrast and display for outside and it simply would not work.All in all, it is a good idea, but it just will not work. And this is from a fan of Hewlett Packard."
5,Jornada is a good value,After considering both the Jornada 548 and Compaq 3600 I finally purchased the Jornada - initially because it was available and the Compaq was not. After using the Jornada for about a month I am VERY happy with the unit and recommend it to anyone who asks.
3,No Pocket PC 2002,"For its day the 548 was a stunning piece of equipment. I have been a Jornada 548 owner since week 1 of its release. I am disappointed to report, however, that the older Jornada models have been left in the dust by the Compaq-HP merger. Ipaq'ers get an upgrade from the Pocket PC OS to the newer, marginally better Pocket PC 2002 OS. Although the OS is only moderately more useful, it is aesthetically more pleasing and is symbolic of the fact that the 548 will receive little attention or support from HP/Compaq ever again.Also, the lack of back up batteries is quite a nuisance when you lose all drivers and software because you forgot to recharge the 548. Furthermore, and this may be my error, I never found a car charger for it which would have been useful given the adequate, but not stellar battery life.I would suggest buying a newer piece of equipment, its worth the dough."
2,"Quick shipment, but now there is a problem w/no response.","The product was shipped quickly. But now I cannot get the Pocket PC to connect to any PC. I have emailed the seller numerous times about this and they will not respond to me. Amazon is abolutely no help either, they will not do anything to help me. If I ever do get the problem fixed, I will change the bad rating for the seller."
3,lot's of annoying little glitches,"It has a lot of functions, but also a lot of little glitches. Freezes up from time to time. Buttons sometimes stop doing what they are suppose to do. You wind up having to reset it and lose data. Their customer support also (is very poor)."
3,HP Jornada 547/548,"Great PDA, beats out any palm type device by a longshot in capability expandability. Only draw back is ever shrinking selection of aftermarket goodies for it due to the processor."
4,Nice PDA,"PROSSturdy design.Pocket PC versions of MS Office and internet explorerSetup was a breezeHandwriting recognitionvoice recordingCONSPoor battery life.The screen is almost impossible to see when you're sunlightOnly 32MB of memoryProcessor speedOVERALLThe Jornada 548 Color Pocket PC is a nice little device. However, if you're looking for a multimedia powerhouse look elsewhere."
2,It all depends on what you what......,"I have tried HP and Casio Palm PC's and returned thenm both. While both are very impressive, they don't fill me needs.I want a small device that will allow me to keep my schedule, check contacts, keep a to-do list, and jot an occasional note. I don't need a box that tries to do everything, is slow, and is clumsy to use. The interface really isn't conducive to editing spreadsheets or documents. I don't have time to play with the media player, and the thing is too big to slip in my pockcet.I really wanted to like these devices, but I will stick with my trusty Palm."
1,Suit Against HP for Misrepresenting Functionality,"I purchased one of the HP 540 series PDA's (in my case, a 548),only to feel compelled to return it to Amazon because of difficultieswith much of the functionality HP advertised, especially regardingemail.As a registered user, I have recently been informed of aclass-action suit against HP for this very reason... I highlyrecommend that you research other options before choosing this PDA."
4,It's a Pocket PC... not a Palm Organizer,"I've used every Palm/Pilot product made... except the Palm VII, which is not useable in the countries I've lived in. I've also used some of the WinCE 1.0 and 2.0 machines. Every time I used one of the WinCE machines, I regreted it, and went back to the Palm... until now.The HP 548, with a 12 bit screen, is a fantastic Pocket PC. It's well built, and as fast as I would expect something this size to be. Yes, you can pay to get additional functions on the Palm, but the functionality is still limited given the processor speed and memory capacity.The 'organizer functions' are not as quick and as simple to use as the Palm... and if that's what you want, buy the Palm. However, if you want a more power, more Windows functionality, and a really impressive machine, buy the 548."
2,Nonreplaceable battery,"I've had my 548 for a little over a year. On a recent plane trip, a flight attendant spilled coffee on my pocket PC and i thought it was history. You can imagine how surprised i was that it came back when everything dried out! The only problem i have is the battery won't hold the charge - so i lose all the entries if it's off the cradle for more than 8 hours.I contacted HP to get a new battery (customer support - and i use the term loosely - took more than 24 hours to respond to the email) but it seems that the battery is not replaceable by anyone but an HP service center. And the number for the US servce is on the west coast - and i'm not! I spent over 45 minutes on hold between two attempts to contact the so-called service center with no success to date.Moral is - don't buy HP unless you really don't need the machine anyway!"
1,Pick Something Else,"I had my Journada for 2 weeks before giving it away. Although a nice screen, it is totally worthless because you have to plug it in constantly. Forget this PDA if you travel. I bought a Palm Vx and love it. Batteries last for a month. I can't even find my car keys in the morning, let only remember to plug this piece of junk in every time I blink."
1,Display is a joke,Must be indoors to use. Returned to store where purchased and ordered Compaq Ipaq. Hard to believe they are the same price.
1,Too Bulky - HP made a mistake with the screen,"One thing about the Palm. You may complain about the fact that it does not handle attachments via email and that the PocketPCs do it effortlessly, yet when it comes to design they beat the PocketPCs hands down.Take a look at this HP Jornada. First HP confessed (as it is a company with integrity) that due to a manufacturing error that screen was not going to handle thousands of colours as originally advertised. The second thing is that the design is bloody awful. It is big and clumsy looking. Almost like something designed in the old Soviet Union.I must admit it's not as horrible looking as the Casio. But close.My advice to you is stay well away from this one. And any of the PocketPCs except perhaps the Compaq IPaq which is extremely groovy looking.Wait for HP to redesign their unit.HP has been doing small devices for nearly 3 decades. They make the best calculators in the industry. I am sure they will get it right."
2,Great But Not For Me!,I recently purchased a Jornada 545 Pocket PC. It was great at first until I wanted to start downloading music and books. It was complicated to use. But the setup is really quick. I thought the writing recognition software was awesome. It is NOT wireless out of the box but you buy flash cards for that. I liked this product but is to complicated for me so I guess I stick with my great Palm VII.
1,Nine months and the honeymoon is over,"The features were great. I thought I had the answer to my PC data portability problem. Having it all online is okay. Having it all online and in my pocket--now that was progress. Speed, performance, she had it all. Then 9 months into the romance she completely let me down. I have had to reset this thing more times then I can count. And just last week it seems to have totally locked up for good. I lost all my data on the PPC and it will not resync with my desktop. I place it in the cradle and nothing happens. That's not new but before if I turned it off and on a few times, perhaps slide it in and out of the cradle a few times and perhaps rebooted my PC eventually my PC and PPC would again notice each other. This time nothing works.This thing should last longer and be more reliable. All the features in the world are of no use at all if the thing is not reliable. For it to only be 9 months old and quit on me says ""Don't waste your money."""
4,Jornada 548,"I would have given it 5 stars if the display was better in bright light. It is fine under incandescent lighting, but fluorescent lighting makes the display hard to read, especially if you are using the HP screen protector. Otherwise, with my 128 Meg CompactFlash card and keyboard, it is almost a real computer. This replaced a Palm IIIc whose built-in battery failed. Only Palm can repair it and the battery alone was [a lot]."
1,Quickly outdated,"I purchased a 548 and returned it the next day. After taking the time to set it up, I started to look for electronic books that could be read on a pocket PC. If you look, the newer titles state they are only for the 2002 version of the operating system. There isn't much software available for ti now though I kept hearing promises of things becoming available in the future. From my experience with Microsoft, we are going to see more things available that requires the new OS and this has a good chance of being left behind. I contacted HP, there is no upgrade and the next version of Jornada that uses the 2002 system is expensive. I'll wait a while longer before trying to upgrade my cheap and reliable Palm and see how the market shakes out."
5,The Best of a Small Field,"With the exception of difficult veiwing outdoors (I don't plan to use it outdoors), it exceeds all expectations. I also suggest anyone contemplating purchasing the HP 548, consider Dan Hanttula's book, ""Pocket PC Handbook."" It is a treasure chest of wonderous things the HP 548 will do."
5,This Pocket PC is Great,"The HP 548 is extemely simple to use, yet very powerful. I have encountered almost no problems in operating it. I highly suggest Pocket PC users and buyers to consider the Hp Jornada."
4,Most bang for the buck,"Yes: The iPAQ has TFT and 206MHz, but costs A LOT more, That's why I won't put the fifth star.BUT with the Jornada you get a compact flash slot IN the chassis (no extra bulk) and a metal flip cover right over the screen which keeps your strokes in secret: no need for an extra pouch or bag (no extra bulk, again, so it REALLY fits my shirt pocket).NOW it's my MP3 player, my Palm, my photo album, my Notebook, and I do even show my own made MPEGs and JPGs to my fiends at work. Neat. It's my working companion (loaded with medicine texts).BEWARE: 1- CSTN screen means direct sunlight won't let you see anything. 2- You'll fill up your 32MB or RAM very soon (so many uses...) so be prepared to wish a 64MB compactflash card (don't worry about buying an extra jacket or adapter: it's there).NICE looking: Executive class looking. iPAQ looks like a toy, and seems very plastic to me. This one looks slim and chick."
3,The wipes worked well on glasses only if ...,"The wipes worked well on glasses only if they were wet first. They tend to streak if not wet enough and would dry with a film. We haven't used them yet with anything other than eyeglasses, as we didn't want to clean more streaks. I'm not sure I would recommend them at this time."
2,"I liked the individual packaging, but that's all. ...","I liked the individual packaging, but that's all. The product was too wet and after a short amount of time it attracted more dust to the lenses."
3,This product was adequate for its purpose. I ...,This product was adequate for its purpose. I have never purchased a commercial lens-cleaning product before. I don't know the retail price of this to know if it's worth the money. I would not give it too high a mark. It's something I could live without.
3,It seemed like these were just alcohol swabs. ...,"It seemed like these were just alcohol swabs. I don't know how the price compares to alcohol swabs, but that's what they smelled like. I would not buy this product if the generic swabs were cheaper. Other than that, they worked great for getting my kid's fingerprints off my glasses!"
4,Just the right touch,"Pads are clean, with just a touch of fluid/chemical to assist in the cleaning process. They don't leave a film like some other cleaners/wipes."
1,Lousy Product,"This is a big dissappointment. Most of the tissues were totally dried out as soon as I opened the package. Even the ""moist"" ones are not great. I have to use two or three tissues to clean one pair of glasses/sunglasses."
4,wipes work well,If you have plastic lenses these wipes work very well to get them clean without scratching. I know that a eyeglass cloth will also work but I prefer the moist wipes because I feel they do a much better job of removing oily smudges.
4,Fantastic!,"Think Man ManThink Classic horrorWatched them perform last night in Asheville, nc and had to get the album."
3,Not the same book!!!,"Most or all of these reviews are NOT of the current edition (the one Amazon is selling)! Look at the dates. This book was published in 2011.They may still be valid, but should not be listed for this book.The 3 stars reflect nothing, but is here since a rating is required and I have not seen this version."
2,Worst travel book that I have ever read,"OK, Buenos Aires is a spanish speaking city; but when every other word of a sentence in this book is full of spanish, it makes the book very very hard to read!!!! ""Facts about Buenos Aires"" is nothing but that, a list of useless facts emblished with unnecessary adjatives: ""...something that differentiates Buenos Aires' people from their North American or European cousins - a striving melancholy and a desire for something greater."" HM??? What we travelers want is an easy to read book, not a trash compactor, TOO much information one after another in a paragraph with vague english + foreign words is a waste. The few pictures in this book don't do justice to the city, take a look at any ""paris"" book out there, your response is usually ""WOW, I would like to go there."" after reading this book, it's like ""hm... why do I want to go there?"" Choose a different book; don't waste your time and money."
2,Hotsync cable,"This item solve my problem partialy, but I don't know if it has a problem, because sometimes when I make the hotsync operation, the Palm lost all memory."
4,Great book for learning about the game,This is an excellent book for those who want to learn more about the mechanics of the sport. The explanations are good and the illustrations are excellent. The techniques are well illustrated and the strategies are also well illustrated. A good one stop shop for beginning to intermediate players and coaches.
5,THE book to improve your skills and knowledge,"This book was designed for one purpose: Making you a better volleyball player. It succeeds. Any typical player will be amazed to find how many errors he's doing (most of which were taught by his admired coach), what effect they have on the play, and how easily they can be corrected. It is very concise, and can follow the player for years to come, as a reference to check and readjust the play over time. Buy this, and you probably won't need any other volleyball book (Amazon will hate me for writing this :-) )."
3,A Neglected Poet,"Thomas's ""Swinburne"" is an acceptable biography, conveying the necessary names, dates and places of ACS's life. The volume, however, is curiously thin, given the monster tomes generated in recent years on Morris, Ruskin and other members of the mid-Victorian set. In covering his territory, one gets the impression that Thomas didn't quite know what to do with the prurient bits of Swinburne's life, alternately dwelling on them and skipping past them. Nonetheless, students of mid-Victorian culture should be grateful for a thoughtful book on so shamefully neglected a poet."
3,Adequate,"Lots of information here, and the author doesn't shy away from the more controversial aspects of the poet's life. Two criticisms, however: First, the author jumps around, A LOT, making it sometimes hard to keep up chronologically with what is going on, and when. Second, I couldn't help but wonder if Thomas actually likes A.C. Swinburne. The timbre of the book tends to lean somewhat towards condescension at times, perhaps even derision."
3,Weapon Of Choice's Warm-Up album,"This is for the funkateers who like to funk n' roll (rock wise). Like Fishbone's 'IN YOUR FACE' EP. It was funkedified but with a hard rocking edge.W.O.C. proves that they can jam with the likes of Fishbone, 24-7-Spyz, Funkadelic and Prince but the choice of lyrics shift this headbangin' nuttmeg into a couple of spins in the CD player. It's a warm-up, I believe it's their debut album, so that's cool. 'Nutmeg sez ""Bozo The Town""' is for the hardcore W.O.C. fans and those that like the guitar punch in their funk but in the end, they smooth it out with a semi-instrumental jazz/fusion thang. Unpredicable band. I like it, but you must ""...trust yo' instink"".""Nutty Nutmeg Phantasy"" the 7 minute jam jump starts the ""potty"" after the ""Hi"" introduction. ""U Owe It To U"" gives a boost of encouragement. The album is jammed packed with funk-rock rhythms, but be careful, 'the ""potty"" to end all ""potties""' could have made this album POTTY."
2,le tigre train?,"this album is really pretty disappointing. the group has lost a chick, added a dude, and.... guitars. alot of guitar. so it's like, gravy train!!!! wanted to be more of a ""band"" or something. it sounds like knockoff le tigre with chanty punky sounding songs. no funny rap songs to be found here. and lead singer ""chunx"" seems to be singing WAY too much. homegirl aint got the best voice, and i wish she wouldve stuck with funny rapping with uber-homo ""hunx"". no fun ""you made me gay"" or ""double decker supreme"" here. which totally sucks cuz the other train!!!! album totally rules. it had a real diy, badly-recorded quality that made it feel way cult-y. this album sounds like it was produced to sound lo-fi on purpose. oh well. their live shows still rule."
1,terrible,jesus christ this is BAD! none of their albums are good though...oh well at least they're consistent in their crappiness
3,Neon Gods 2 too much!,What can I say about this effort by WASP... Not great! Maybe if it was one album & not 2! Trim the fat(the crap) & you got an ok album! Better luck next time guys!
3,3.5 stars,Another nice album by Wasp but nothing special. If you like Wasp you will probably like this too. But its not like their first albums. This album is like The neon God Part 1 -> it just follows the same patterns. I'm between its just ok and i like it .
2,I'll disagree with above reviews...,"I'm a long-time, dedicated WASP fan, and I'll say this Part II is pretty lousy. I was very disappointed, sounds like a bunch of filler and stuff that wasn't good enough to make it on Part I. Part I is ""good"" if you are a WASP fan, it took me while to get into it, XTC Rider being the high point of that. This Part II, I have no idea why Blackie even bothered. I've been listnening to it, trying to like it, but there just isn't much there to like. I'm actually kind of pissed that I wasted $20 buck on it. I suggest you keep your money, or buy one of the other WASP recordings."
5,blackie rox,"i bought the part 1 and part2 first day both albums rock hard i love tis band so much, i knew this band fron 10 years ago i wached their vide on V-channel in europe ""i wanna be somebody"" then their first aibum i bought from them was dying for the world that album is best blackie album i believe, rapidly became my fav band after Gns n roses but radio stations dont support em, so atlanta's suxBUY this album and other WASP previous albums ya will love this man and his music"
4,A VERY IMPRESSIVE HELLRIDE OF METALLIC BLISS!,"Say what you will about Blackie Lawless, but this man is one of the best Rock Artists to ever record music. Only Bruce Dickinson ranks higher on my list of Kick-Ass Metal Heads! ""Demise"" is the conclusion of a two CD story about the dangers of Religios fanaticism and the corruption of ""absolute power"" over others. You have to be a bit intelligent, to understand all of the lyrics, but the music will put other bands of the day to shame. NOBODY can ROCK harder than W.A.S.P.!!! So support this band by purchasing your own legitamite copy of ""DEMISE"" I'm sure BLACKIE will appreciate it!!! Rock For Life, or just drop dead today! ROCK LIVES IN ALL OF YOU!"
3,"Better than part 1, but!!","So you've come back for more have you? Well this cd is better musically than part one and yes it does have it's moments, but really it's just missing something in the end. Maybe it's the fact that we're tired of this story as we've heard it before in the Who's Tommy or W.a.s.p's own Crimson Idol? Either way it's been done before and it's time for a new start. The cd jacket is ok but nothing fantastic. It's like the story was told in book one and well Blackie didn't feel like writing it out again or had just given up? Either way it's an ok cd and nothing more."
3,Better than part 1,If found that the neon god 1 & 2 sound very similar almost the same except for the fact that part 2 rocks harder. It is my own opinion that the only reason to buy the first one is for the story which I found to be a pretty expensive story.I also thought that I could here a few similarities to some of the songs on Tommy a who album. Overall average album but not W.A.S.P.'s best.
3,Only analysis of real and complex fields...,"Bear does an excellent job of introducing real and complex analysis, but fails to generalize to general metric spaces and ignores R^n, for n>2.However, he presents the fields axioms for the reals in a clear fashion. And he has an entire chapter devoted to the natural numbers, making rigorous all the arithmetic you learned in elementary school.I used this book as a supplement to Rudin."
2,Really Disappointing Ending,"I don't know what happened to Mr Card but after enjoying the entire series which I found was excellent, this story was a very obvious disappointment. There were plot holes after plot holes. Things he's lead up to for 5 books were ignored and glossed over. It didn't even seem like the same author wrote it.Overall I loved the series and despised the conclusion. So the question is, do I still recommend it to others? I have no idea."
3,Unworthy Addition,"The story begins by with a huge knowledge gap between this and the previous book. Some years have passed and the character dynamics have changed considerably without much in the way of background being provided. Similarly, the book ends leaving the reader with the distinct feeling that there is room for another book. That is, the story is not finished. I felt that the book was unworthy of the previous five and appeared to be written to fulfill a contractual obligation. I did not feel as though the author's heart was really in it (in fact, it could almost have been written by somebody else) although it is a good yarn. Orson Scott Card fans must read the series, but be prepared for some disappointment with this last book."
2,Feels like Filller,"I was very much looking forward to this novel after having read the other books in the series. I avoid purchasing hardbacks whenever possible, but I decided to give in to my need to hear the rest of the story.What I loved about the series was the world that Orson Scott Card created, which is still present in this book, but the magic of the world is not there.The other novels felt more like a complex journey, literally of travelling and spiritually to look at one's purpose in the world. This book lacked that insight and left me feeling that it was just filler and/or a way to close out the series.I don't regret having purchased the book but I do have to admit I was disappointed. I am a long time reader of OSC's novels and I have at least one more waiting to be read but I would suggest that you check this one out from the library. I would also suggest that you do finish the series if you started to finally see the city."
2,DULL AT BEST,"Another chapter in the saga of Alvin Maker that seems to have no objective, form or substance. As I read this book I continually wondered when I would finally get to a part with some interest or relevance, I never found it. Follow Alvin as he whups up on the nasty white man and saves the blacks, injuns and French. Oh yeah, he starts to build his crystal city but not in any way you might have expected.Is it bad? No. What it is is boring. Too bad, I have been following this story from the very beginning and really enjoyed most of it. There must be some extremely virulent disease going through the fantasy/SF community that has wiped out the ability of many writers to actually finish stories. Hopefully they will come up with a cure soon.Unfortunately it will be too late for this one. It is DOA, terminally boring. I can't in all good conscience recommend this one, even to Mr. Cards most fevered fans. Hopefully he will put this puppy to sleep in his next volume."
4,Finally getting Somewhere!,"I enjoyed the realization of the Crystal City at long last, While Alvin had some new troubles and seems to have lost some of his abilities It was great to see the evolution of the altered history. Alvin placed the Crystal City where Joseph Smith built Navoo, of course this is a parallel, I wonder how the future will unfold now? Is Arthur Stuart a Maker because of Alvin's Teachings or because he has altered DNA? With So much Makery going on Peggy should give up trying to predict the future, or at least stop worring about it! What will America be after the war to come? What combination of factors will make Alvin willing to allow himself to die? Why on Earth wont he just make another plow of ordinary gold to get teh law off his back! It is a wonderful series, I love all of Card's Novels but this series makes me wish he did nothing else!"
3,Was not what I hoped for,"Like other readers I eagerly awaited the release of ""The Crystal City."" But unlike other readers I was disappointed in the book. At its best is it excellent in the story layout and characters. It was classic ""Card"" but I thought he tried too hard to bring in components of the first five books and that detracted from the story line a great deal.Lets face it. We are avid readers of the ""Maker"" series and so much detail from previous books just pumped up the page count. I found the ending the most disappointing of all. When I hit the last page I felt as if I should be able to turn the page and finish reading the ending and it just was not there.What he did do was make me look forward to the next book to see how this one should have ended. It is worth the buy for sure, but you may be upset at how it ends..."
3,"Enjoyed, but will not re-read","This applies to the whole series. I enjoyed reading it, but I doubt I'll ever re-read it. At the end of this book I was left feeling unsatisfied. Orson Scott Card seems to be able to start series with a lot of promise but never seems to be able to finish them. They just sort of peter out."
4,OK Ending,Loved all of the books in this series and all the way up to the end it was a great journey but it sort of felt unfinished. I wish that there was more to the ending.
2,Eh.,"I love, love, love Orson Scott Card's Alvin Maker series, but he is just pushing it now. It's time to let it go man! This book isn't a complete waste of time, but it's not something I would read instead of say, doing laundry. It's just not that good."
2,Another Orson Scott Card series peters out...,"Like the Ender seriers did with Children of the Mind and the Homecoming series did with Earthborn, the Alvin Maker series sputters to a conclusion (hopefully) in The Crystal City.Not that this book was terrible, but it just didn't seem to have any purpose other than gettin Alvin and his followers to the Crystal City, and there just wasn't anything interesting enough that happened along the way. I think they were all too good, and too powerful, that you knew they would always do the right thing, and you also knew that they always could, so there wasn't any doubt about the conclusion.If you've read the rest of the series, you'll probably want to read this book just for closure, just don't expect much."
1,complete dissapointment,"I have been a huge fan of card for over 20 years, but this book is horrible. I cannot believe card wrote this. The characters seem like flat parodies of the people I loved from the first three books. Quit reading the series after Prentice alvin if you want to keep feeling good about it. How a brilliant premise and three treasured books could be turned to such tripe I will never understand."
3,disappointing after waiting so long,"I loved the first 5 novels in this series. I looked forward to this book and was disappointed. If you read the first 5, like me, you are likely going to read this no matter what I say, but consider buying it used or borrowing it from a friend! Unlike the first 5 novels, it is predictable and there is little additional character development. I know Mr. Card has strong Mormon beliefs, but in the end when the Crystal City's tower is named a ""tabernacle"", that was just a little too much for me. I don't know if I hope there is a 7th book or not."
5,Excellent Adventure,"I enjoyed this newest contribution as much or more than the previous works. It is a fabulous adventure, and I am awaiting the next installment very impatiently. It is not apparent as yet whether Mr. Card is actully going to produce the next installment, I hesitatingly admit, but I believe there is more to tell in this adventure. Here's hoping. At any rate, this book was a very good investment. Hope you enjoy it as much."
3,"Not his best work, and not the best in the Alvin series","This book was interesting because I liked the characters. Other than that, though, it felt really... incomplete. It seemed to skip (although referring to) a lot of things that'd happened since the last book in the series, and how the action fit in with everything that was going on in North America at the time just wasn't clear.OSC is usually better than this; one wonders if he's starting to slip. Personally, I doubt it, but then I'm not objective; I love the guy and suck up whatever he writes. :)"
3,alvin!!!,"Of all the books in the Alvin maker series, Crytal City is by far the worste. The reasons for this are two fold but in essence you get tired of Alvin's Whinney attitude throught out the entire book.He is almost afraid to do anything for fear of corupting someone with his powers.Their is almost no mention of the unmaker in the book. Hence Alvin has no real villian to pit himself against. As such the book becomes a moral dialogue about the wrongness of slavery, bigotry, and discrimination.As such the story gets bogged down in values. Values of an America that never was.Safe travels:David"
5,Doug is Awesome!,I sure miss this show and Amazon is the only one who produces it on dvd. They do an excellent job and the show is great! I wish they made more shows like this now a days.
3,Decent economy strap,"Very much an ""economy grade"" strap. Actually not too bad for the money but don't expect more than you pay for. Doesn't fit very well with straplocks due to the thin leather ends but seems durable enough to hold my Les Paul. I'm going to buy something heavier but I'll keep this one for an older guitar or as a backup. Product arrived very fast."
4,Good mid-level reader book,"I got this book for my 3rd grade daughter who is reading slightly above grade level. The stories of Tubman's life were a bit dry (not really a dramatic telling), and the historical fact segments inserted into each chapter lacked context. But the general sense of the scope of her work on the railroad, her personal commitment, and the additional things she did in her life were generally well communicated. Readers certainly come away with a greater appreciation for Tubman's contribution despite numerous personal challenges."
4,Wonderful portrayal of a wonderful women!,Harriet Tubman was a wonderful women and this book hits the highlights of her life. This book explains her life while she was still conducter on the Underground Railroad but it also goes into detail about her life after she was a conducter. It is a wonderful story too! It did not seem like a factual novel but actually seemed like a wonderful story. I hope everyone will try to read this book.
3,Harriet Tubman Conductor on the Underground Railroad,This is a very well writen book. It discuses the main idea of being a slave in Harriet's time. I loved reading this book it was a good book for a Social Studies report. I enjoyed reading about her freeing slaves. I would recomend this book o anyone.
3,very personal,"I loved the first biography by Elie Wiesel, All Rivers Run to the Sea. I loved his objectivity, his detached but sharp view on the incredible and often cruel incidents that happened in his life, as well as his reserved but firm believe and philosophy you can see behind it. I was fascinated by the personal story of this incredible person and was impressed by the power of his quiet words that was much powerful than too emotional accounts on the tragedy that we often hear.However this book, And the Sea is Never Full, is very different from the previous volume. It is much more emotional and more centred around his phiolosophy on his religion. I am giving only 3 stars, not because it's not good - people who are interested in Wiesel's religious believe and stands most likely will find it interesting - but because I expected more stories on his life (and philosophy behind it) not believe itself, and found this book a bit too personal, as if written for himself rather than for readers."
5,Recomendado,"Perfume con aroma agradable, para mi es una fragancia para utilizarla a diario. La tienda que lo vendía fue responsable con el envío. Llegó en el tiempo acordado. Los recomiendo."
5,Hugo XX for Women.,"I received the perfume very fast at home it's one of my favorites in the world. I love it, it's perfect to use everyday."
5,Huele muy rico,"Excelente perfume huele muy rico, donde llego las personas me preguntan por el, llego a tiempo asi que lo recomiendo 100%"
5,Hugo XX for Women,"Thanks to Amazon and Perfumania!Delivery was before the scheduled date!!Very nicely packed by Amazon-i have ordered many things from Amazon, incl. watches, and they are simply perfect.Perfumania-i also received two vial samples from Swiss Army-very thoughtful!Hugo XX is very sensual and smooth-great for day as well as night use. It's a gift for the wifey-bet she will love it!cheers!"
1,false offering,"I turned to Amazon when I couldn't find Brach's Butterschotch Star Brites in my local stores. They were offered on a site that looked reliable. I had to order more than I needed, but I was willing to buy 12 bags. What I received was hard butterscotch candy, but NOT the Star Brites. Turns out that that they are no longer made [I found that out by e-mailing the candy maker]. So it was a disappointment to say the least. The candy I received is good butterscotch hard candy, but that's not what I ordered. It was too much trouble to return it. Also the seller would not send me a free return label. Please removed Brach's Butterscotch Star Brites from any merchant's site---others will be disappointed as I was."
3,Unleash the Beast,"While I love the NWOBHM, I have never been a big saxon Fan. I tried this album after prevewing it on youtube and It is not a bad album, but it doesn't go on my favorites list either. My favorite Tracks are All Hell Breaking loose, and Thin Red Line. I'd Preview it before you bought it because it seems that some people love it, While Others Hate it. I'm kind of Between them."
4,Not really an anniversary collection,"I have to agree with other reviewers. While I love the current work in Rose is Rose, this is not an anniversary collection. It is a standard reprint book (which if fine if you call it that) with a small number of historical pages. I was hoping for much more in a such titled edition.If extra bonuses are to be included, then call them that. See the Fox Trot treasuries for such examples. Otherwise, don't call it an anniversary.Fans of Rose is Rose *will* love this volume, just don't be taken in by the title."
4,Great book! But I expected more...,"For the 15th anniversary of Rose is Rose, I expected something more along the lines of Lynn Johnston's 15th Anniversary book of For Better or For Worse. It showed an extensive history and the colorized Sundays since its debut. In this book, it has only 8 pages of history. I must add it was quite informative. The annual collections are, with a doubt, great! It allows me to read the comics I missed since my newspaper isn't able to carry them (another paper has exclusive rights). All in all, I love Pat Brady's work. I love the way he draws the characters in different perspectives and of course the humor! It kind of puts a warm feeling in your heart I also like the glossy cover. FWIW, I've been a fan since 1991."
2,Nothing original,"This book is somewhat difficult to read, and adds nothing to what the better poker books teach. I don't think this book will turn you into a losing player, but your money is better spent elsewhere. I sold my copy soon after buying it."
3,If anything just buy for the Jaimmes got a gal remix,"First the songs on the single are1. Berlin chair2. Can't explain3. Jaimme (makers mark version)4. All I want to do is rockBerlin chair speaks for itself, recently polling in the hottest 100 of all time on triple J here is aus.Can't explain is a fairly run of the mill rock song with good music and catchy lyrics.Jaimme (makers mark version) is an acoustic version of Jaimmes got a gal which is worth buying the single for, an amazing version with clean lyrics and simple acoustic.All I want to do is pretty bad, a very cliche generic rock song that sounds straight off a pub bands self released ep.Overall 2 great songs and one unforgettable b side make this a good find."
5,Could you help me?,"I have been looking for an old ""Country House Plans"" magazine I belive that the Title was ""Sweet Dream House"", and I know it was the fall of '97' issue. could someone help me.Stevesut@Juno.com"
3,Teaching of Contempt,"This is a distillation of Jules Isaac's ""Jesus and Israel."" He begins with two contradictory considerations: A true Christian can't be an anti-Semite, and anti-Semitism is profoundly rooted in Christianity.To demonstrate his points, Isaac investigates three major Christian themes: 1) That the Jews were banished from Palestine as punishment for killing Jesus; 2) That Judaism was degenerate at the time of Jesus; 3) That Jews are guilty of the crime of deicide. Using logic and countless examples, Isaac disassembles each accusation by explaining its genesis, its propagation and its falseness."
4,Seeds of Deception,"This is most likly the scareist non fiction book I have ever read. Jeffery Smith lets you know where he got his information. So you can look it up and see for yourself. Words that should scare you "" Hi where from the Goverment and we are here to help you""."
1,whatever,I'd rather take from real scientists. this guy is not even a doctor and has no scientific backgrounds to tell me that what I all eat now is dangerous.1 star reviews here in his other book is worth seeingGenetic Roulette: The Documented Health Risks of Genetically Engineered Foods
1,Joke,"Jeffrey Smith has zero scientific credentials, yet his books are analyses of scientific papers. This man creates hysteria for profit and the information disseminated in this book is not worth the paper its written on."
2,Not what I expected...,"I guess I should have paid closer attention to the word 'Alhambra' this sounds like something the Shah of Iran or some Islamic person would like. I don't like that heavy of a middle-eastern sound in my flamenco, too bad I liked his other albums"
3,"Good 1942 ""B"" film","""Eyes in the Night"" was director Fred Zinneman's first feature film after having, among other things, directed some MGM short subjects, notably some of their ""Crime Does Not Pay"" entries. Here he directed a tidy little thriller which is a little slow in getting started but builds tension and suspense as it goes along. The plot deals with a blind detective and his seeing-eye dog who become enmeshed with enemy agents. There is a quiet intelligence to this film which is noticeable in other early Zinneman efforts, particularly ""Kid Glove Killer"", another good MGM ""B"" not on home video and ""The Seventh Cross"". The villains are shrewd and resourceful not given to ""for the fatherland"" melodramatics of so many other films of this period. A solid first feature from a fine director."
5,Simple and great for travel,"I have like 6 of these for my cameras. They work great. Simple, inexpensive, and decent storage."
4,Almost Flawless,"I bought this card for my Casio Exilim 6 megapixel camera. Having two gigs of memory is really nice. I like to take videos with my camera and it takes up a lot of memory.The only problem I have had with this card is that when I put the card in the SD port on my laptop, some pictures/videos cannot be transfered to my hard drive. I am pretty sure my computer is only capable of accessing the firt gig of memory, if that makes sense. I solved this problem by leaving the card in the camera and transfering the data via usb."
1,"Card is fine, avoid the seller","It's described as ""Retail Packaging,"" but the card did not come in any kind of packaging, just the small plastic cover/case. Basically, they threw the card itself in a small brown envelope with minimal padding. It could be used or returned for all I know. Very misleading, not to mention cheaper and more secure from other vendors."
1,Poor way to Pack,"SANDISK was destroyed by PostOffice sorting machine, because seller put item in a letter envelope and had the nerve to charge me $4.95 for a 64 cents mailing. His putting item in an ENVELOPE caused the post office to run it through their sorting machine, which then destroyed the SanDisk.How do I get my money back???"
5,Works fantstic,"After i purchased this card, i have travelled a lot and have taken several pictures... it just works perfect with my Canon digital camera."
1,Will never order again,I have bought several things from amazon and have never been so disappointed. I have to this day not received the memory card. I will never order another thin.g from your site
2,whats the deal?,"whats the deal scandisk, i can put this thing in my computer...i loaded it on my camera and put it in the floppy drive on my computer and not its stuck in there because someone was an idiot and did design this right."
2,misinformed,I thought I was getting a good deal when I saw that it says 2 SD flash memory card but unfortunately you only get one card. Why does it say 2 GB 2 SD Flash Memory Card?
4,QUESTION?,"Does anyone know if this can be used with a Canon SD630 camera? I am going to order the camera in a few minutes, and can't figure out if it is too large? Also, how many pics will this hold if it's a 6MP camera?Thanks!"
1,I've given up on Sandisk,"A few years ago I purchased one of their SD cards and had lots of trouble with it. Should have payed attention then - bought one of these 2GB cards the other day and right out of the package it would only handle 986 MB, though the capacity showed as 1893 MB.Sandisk had problems back then, and they obviously still do. No more of their stuff for me!"
2,I cancelled this item and never recevied it.. I tried to get a credit back without any success. Please Help!!,I cancelled this item and never received it. I have been trying to get a credit back without any success. Please Help!!!ThanksStephen Lau
1,Wrong memory Stick,"This memory stick was advertised with the Nikon Coolpix P4 camera I purchased. It does not work with this camera. My son had a camera that it did work in, so I gave it to him. Do you have a memory stick that works with Nikon cameras?"
1,"paid for it, they charged me. it never arrived.","I would love to review it, but having SanDisk insist they sent it when they did not, is a warning to all."
1,Purchase from Amazon of SD 2GB Memory Card,Wrong Item was shipped and it took too long to receive credit. Too many phone calls and E-Mails. Utitimately resolved almost two weeks later. Too much of my time required for a simple transaction which was the suppliers fault.
1,do no buy,i brought this device and it did not work and i had to pay 20 dollars for shipping and when i returned it i had to pay again for shipping and they send me the same device back and i lost all money i paid because it still didnt work and i was tired of sending things back and forth. plus the device was used. so in other words dont buy or your get ripped off.
5,I have this but why would somebody use a 2GB now,"I am mainly reviewing this to show the reliability of SanDisk. This has been working for several years and still works. That shows the reliability as the card gets removed from camera to camera. These days these are practically of no use. One small HD video will not fit into this. Interesting, this is almost like a 1.44 MB floppy. I purchased a 64 GB microSD SandiskSanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46Arecently, and in few years will probably see similar fate. Interesting how Sandisk keeps innovating and keeping up with Moore's law."
3,Good value for the money,The cards are just as advertised. I use them in my job where I take 200 and more pictures a day. They do their job but they are no where as quick as the Ultras and if you need speed and quick recovery from your camera they are not for you. That being said if normal use of a camera or storing data is your concern they are a great value for the money.
3,Beware of retail vs. bulk version,"The memory seems to be fine, but you may want to look for the bulk version of this product that cost about half as much. I only discovered that there was a bulk version after I placed the order, and when I received the memory, the bulk version is what was shipped anyways."
5,Working very well - in the right equipment,"I ordered this for my nine year old son, but he wasn't able to use it, since his video camera can only handle 512MB maximum. That's the only drawback there has been, however. Luckily, my husband's digital camera had a 512MB card (still much more than my son's old card), so they switched cards, and the 2GB card has been working very well in my husband's digital camera, giving him memory to take more video as well as pictures. It's been great so far (he's had it for a month or so now). I'd recommend it, just be sure your equipment can take a 2GB card!"
5,Great Deal,"I ordered this item new from amazon & eBay just before going on vacation, both arrived before I left but amazon sent it to me new, boxed, in original packing, eBay sent it in bubble wrap and an envelope, I doubt it was new and it cost more. Next time I'll stick with Amazon.com."
5,excellent,it is working very well. I have been using the same model for a while and am satisfied with it. Will buy it again in the future.
5,Takes pictures at 60 miles an hour!,"I used this card on my recent vacation to South Dakota where my daughter was married. I have still pics, family pics, wedding video and pictures taken on the trip thru Minnesota at 50-60 miles an hour at whatever struck my fancy going down the road. Many of the 60 miles an hour pics, taken both thru the windshield and the side window were perfect. some were not, but what amazed me were the ones that were! by the way, I only used a little Kodak point and shoot digital camera, nothing fancy!"
5,Still working after 2 years in storage,"I bought a SD card for my camera about 2 years ago. I accidentally bought two, so put one of them in storage until I could find a use for it. This weekend, I got another camera and put it in. It worked great, even after being shuffled around in 2 separate moves.This company makes great, long lasting products."
4,Not enough memory for RAW users,I really needed a 4 GB card....so I order a 2nd card to go with this one.Shipped quickly.
3,Can be frustrating,"The first time I copied to it, my Mac (OS10.3.x) froze up. Reformating it did not help, and the instructions at Sandisk did not correspond to the menus & options on my windows machine. Seems to work after getting a new card reader, but it was a frustrating experience."
1,Read the fine print,This item along with another from the same supplier was defective. There was evidence of prior use(sticky residue). No response from the seller until negative feedback was given. Then the RMA process was punative and not worth the expense of returning the item.
1,Didnt work... and ........,after reading the comments on the sellers return policy I decided to just take the loss and go to the store and purchase another one.. It worked!
1,SD Memory Card,I used a gift certificate and some of my own money yetI have now a SD Card that does not function on my computer.I need to ask for my money back but don't know the procedure.
1,SanDisk 2 GB SD Memory Card,this was offered as an accessory for the Sony camera that I purchased at the same time (as a gift). The card arrived on time but does not work with the camera -- doesn't fit. Very disappointing.
3,If you get an error message...,"I got an error 0x80070052 after copying about 180 image files over to this card, and I was unable to add any more files, even though there was plenty of available space. After too much frustration and research, I figured out that I needed to (1) format the card as FAT32 and (2) create a sub-folder and copy the files into it. Then I was able to successfully copy over almost 1000 files. (Actually, I'm not sure if both steps are necessary -- one or the other may be enough. But I did both.)So, $20 for 2 gigs is a great deal, but SanDisk loses two stars for frustration. It shouldn't have been that hard."
4,Big capacity .. but not that fast,"Certainly a value buy. Works great on my treo 650. One caveat though. Make sure your card reader can read it, even my San Disk PCMCIA 6 in 1 card reader cannot recognize the card properly."
3,Wished for a case,"The picture of the product in the Amazon page appeared to show that each SD card was in a plastic case. Unfortunately, that was not so; rather, there was a plastic liner in the cardboard holder, which I wound up cutting and taping over each card to protect it.Although each SD card was inexpensively priced, it should not have cost much more to enclose each in a plastic ""snap-case"".And the Shipping & Handling charge was a significant multiple of the product cost, which is quite surprising given the small size and weight of each SD card (with no reduction for a multiple-item purchase).I wish that the product description had been more specific."
1,Terrible! Card failed and we lost saved photos,"I am very disappointed with this product. We used this card in our Kodak camera for about 2 years with no problems, then all of a sudden the card failed. We had taken about 50 photos during a trip, and reviewed them on the camera with no problem. When we got home and tried to view the photos on our computer, they were gone. However, photos from a previous trip remained on the camera. I have since read reports from others using this memory card that they have had the same problem. It appears that the card fails over time, and occasionally will delete or fail to store photos. We've been having problems with it ever since, and I'm going to throw it away and buy a different brand. I would not recommend this product if you care about keeping your photos safe."
5,great product great price,"works great, tons of storage space, how can you go wrong with a device that uses an sd card."
4,SanDisk 2 GB Class 2 SD Flash Memory Card SDSDB-2048-A11,Works just fine. Does what a memory card should and the price is right. Would I buy it again - sure.
4,SanDisk 2 GB SD Memory Card,Perfect for digital camera and stored media files and . . very low price .
4,"SanDisk 2GB Card - Good price, very reliable",Reliable SD card if you don't need a lot of storage. I've purchased a few Sandisk SD cards and I've never experienced any problems or loss of data.
3,SanDisk 2 GB SD Memory Card,"I ordered two of the Memory Cards. I've only used one to date and was very disappointed when it didn't work when I put it in my printer! It wouldn't upload to my computer. I took it to Rite Aid and used their machine and it DID work! I'm not sure why it didn't work, but my other Memory Cards work just fine. This is a larger (2 GB) card than I've had before, so it could be that my printer isn't able to handle that much memory. The message when I tried to upload to my computer was that the card was damaged, however."
5,nuvi user,Reliable memory. I use it in my Nuvi360 to load Europe maps for my trips and was very concerned regarding reliabilty - nobody wants to loose the navigation somewhere you don't know... Worked perfect!
5,"good stuff, enough for my daily or heavy work",no need bother to change cards any more. it works perfect and smooth.
1,Outrageous shipping fees!,"Beware! BoBoTECHNIC, the seller of this item, charges about $5.00 for EACH item ordered, depending on your location and how fast you want it. If you order 4 of these memory cards, your shipping will be around $20!!! The purchase price may be low, but you'll be gouged on shipping if you buy from this seller."
1,Beware of Sandisk,"I recently read an article of counterfeit items coming through a variety of channels. I have a bunch of Sandisk memory devices and I found three out of the 8 were counterfeit, including one very expensive CF card.Sandisk might be a fine manufacturer and getting a bad rap because of the counterfeit items.But as a buyer you've got to ask yourself two questions:1. If some of these have even come through Amazon, which is a very reputable company in my opinion, what's my risk in buying a Sandisk device? This is particularly true when you can buy an equivalent Kingston device for less.2. What is Sandisk doing to go after the counterfeit market? When this problem happened to Microsoft they clearly went after the perpetrators, let everyone know what was happening so they could better avoid the problems, and creatively came up with solutions to help fix the problem. I've got the strong feeling that Sandisk would rather hide the problem after talking with their support."
3,It's a memory card,"and does what memory cards do. Why only 3 stars - it works the same as dozens of other memory cards I have bought, and doesn't do it indifferently or more excitingly. It is what it is. The price was good, hence the purchase, but as the price on Amazon changes frequently I can't say buy it based on price.A good product at a good price."
1,No way to contact seller...,I purchased the wrong size memory card & I tried to locate contact information for the Amazon marketplace seller...I did a google search & found nothing. Nothing on their packing slip included their contact info...no e-mail address or phone number. So I ended up exchanging the product at a local Office Depot to get the correct size memory card that I needed. Not a smooth process at all...
1,Not for Photo storage,"I bought this card to be used with a Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP Digital Camera. DO NOT BUY THIS CARD if you want to store high megapixel Photos. Well, you can go out for a cup of coffee with a friend while downloading the contents of this card into the computer. IT TAKES FOR EVER!!!Moreover, my Toshiba Satellite laptop does not recognize the device; I cannot view my pictures there.There has to be an easier way! I feel I lost my money."
5,More is better,This memory card doubles the available storage space for cameras which can use it. This was especially important in recording movies from my digital camera as movies are very space demanding.
5,Sandisk Bargain,"My son was very happy to find this product. We'd looked in local stores, and this item was very pricey. Now he can take pictures to his heart's content. It arrived in perfect condition and in a short time."
3,SD card,The card is of very good quality and works well. For today's market I would use and ultra II instead.
2,coompatibility issues,"do not buy this disk or any other disk that is 2 gb unless you know for sure the disk is compatible with your card reader (or with your machine). they will corrupt or lose 1 gb of memory unless compatible. i have bought 3 of these disks : 2 sandisk , 1 lexar. older card readers and older electronics will often be incompatible.caveat emptor."
2,Couldn't Use,"Bought this for an old camera that had a smaller gb card. Unfortunately, this card didn't solve the problem, and I couldn't take pictures with it."
5,fine,"It works, and has a lot of room for storage. That's what I expected, and that's what I got. Fine."
2,Ordered SD Received SDHC...,"Thanks for the misleading description and part number.If you're going to sub an item, you really should contact the consumer as they might have a specific need. Especially with computer and data related items."
5,Rugged,"I've used this brand and it's never failed so far. I own 4 gb and 8 gb cards also. The 2 size is good if you're taking photos of something special and don't want to waste time editing or just want to get some photos e-mailed fast. SanDisk is the way to go.I've also used the Kingston Brand and have lost precious data, not recommended."
3,Warning! No protective case,I ordered two of these. They did not come with the little plastic protective case. So now I'll have to find some of those someplace to store them in. I'm disappointed.
5,more memory 2GB card,"very nice 2GB Memory Card for my Camcorder , includes More Memory , would Buy Again , San Disk is a Popular Name"
5,It is what it is,This product does exactly what it should and the seller was great. Would recommend both to anyone.
4,good memory card bad service from amazon,"I bought a camera and amazon recomended this memory card saying people who bought this also bought the memory car"" or somethig like that..I paid extra to get the camera in a few days because I was leaving on vacation thinking I was going to get the disk also and you guessed it I didnt.. So I got another one at best buy. The product is a good one Amazon's failer to make it clear I wasnt going to get both items together was very disapointing.."
5,Sandisk 2 MB SD Memory card,"Careful to get the correct SD card for my laptop I purchased it for purposes of ReadyBoost. The slot was there so I thought for the cost it was worth trying out. So far after a couple of weeks I have not noticed any appreciable speed difference, but the RAM is there just in case."
4,SanDisk 2 GB SD Memory Card,Decent price on a 2GB memory card. I use it in my Panasonic digital camcorder for storing images.
2,"Works well, no carrying case included","Probably my fault for not inspecting the tiny product image more closely, but I was expecting a small plastic carrying case to be included. There was none. I would not buy this product again for that reason."
1,onSale Cheat!,Do not buy anthing from onSale.They're gonna hold your money for 5 days and cancel your order without any reaction.There are so many good business men except onSale.It's serious. Check about onSale in Amazon.It's true.
3,Problems to use Sandisk 2 GB with Dell Axim X51V,We found several problems to use this Sandisk with our Axim X51V....its doesnt work !!
5,"SanDisk 2 GB SD Memory Card ( SDSDB-2048-A10, Retail Package)",This memory card allows me to load all of the North American maps into my GPS. It saves a lot of time by eliminating the need to load different sections of the country when I am traveling. SanDisk memory cards have proven to be the most reliable of those I have tried.
3,Amazon's SD memory card,"When i first tried this product, i thought it was DOA. I tried using it in both my camera and my laptop, and the card could not be recognized no matter what i did. Then i went to Best Buy and bought a USB connector for the SD card for about $20. After i bought the USB connector home, the Amazon SD card worked fine. If i could do it over again, i would have bought the 4GB SD card from Best Buy that came with a USB cable for about $25 more."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I have my camera set on almost the highest setting and it still has room for almost 900 pictures using the 2GB card... GREAT VALUE, worth so much more than the price"
5,Can't beat this product,The SD card was purchased for a Canon digital camera. It has exceeded my expectations in durability and number of recorded inmages. The card is a perfect match for the Canon SX100 IS.
4,Excelent value for price,I especially appreciated not being gouged on shipping like so many small items are.I found this item to be priced fairly and delivered promptly.
4,Good memory. The shipping package was exagerated,"I bought this memory because it was sold directly from Amazon. I live outside US, so I received it through an International Mailing Service. The shipping package measures about 10' x 10' x 5', which is quite big for a single SD memory than comes in a really small blister. I pay the volumetric weight of the package, which is quite high, compared to the physical weight of the product. I think than an envelope with plastic bubbles would be more suitable to the size of the blister."
5,SanDisk 2 GB SD Memory Card,"I had in initially purchased a 512 MB SD card, to add to my Garmin GPS c330 unit. Once I purchased the Mapsource DVD, with about 1.8 GB of data, I knew that I might need the 2 GB SanDisk SD card; I assumed that the price would be steep (like about $100) for a 2 GB card. I was pleasantly shocked to see such a low, affordable price for it. The card has also now stored ALL the data from the MapSource DVD, with space to spare. Great product, and excellent pricing!"
3,memory card,"I bought this card to go with a product that was returned. Someday I will buy something that can use it, maybe."
4,SanDisk @ GB works great,I went on vacation to Hawaii and used my camera with SanDisk memory card. It worked flawless and I had plenty of memory to take pictures. I understand that SanDisk now has an 8 GB memory card. I am in the process of ordering it.
3,Item Review,My item was delivered in a timely manner and was in excellent condition once i received it!!!!
3,SanDisk is the OG,"SanDisk is dependable. Packaged safely and user friendly. Beware of other computer outlets when you insert a memory chip. My mother-in-law's computer turned my pictures and then didn't turn them back I don't know if this is a computer issue or the chip? So, to be fair, I can't rate it any higher."
1,1 GB works better than 2 GB?,I've used the memory card couple of times and now it's not working anymore. I couldn't figured out why there's no pictures in there. All my pics got deleted :-( I also have a 1 GB and it's still working.
1,Beware: Bulk Packaging,"This item is listed as retail packaging but it came only in the small plastic case; no retail packaging. When I called them they said this is retail packaging. I'm returning it, but they won't pay for return shipping, so it's a rip-off. You can get this card in bulk packaging for a lot less elsewhere on Amazon.2GB SanDisk Secure Digital SD Memory Card 2 GB (Bulk)"
1,"great, if you don't want to reuse","I have purchased several Scan Disk cards, I could always find them on sale. But much to my dismay, they have locked up. I cannot delete the old pictures on them to free up the space. I keep getting ""write protect"" messages, My card is not write protected, I even tried the good ole scotch tape thing, no go. I know several peopel this has hapened to, STAY AWAY from Scan Disc."
5,Good product and on time delivery,The delivery and the product was good. I got what i was expecting.
4,Pretty Good,Actualy allows for 1.89GB of actual memory space but thats o.k with me as I plan to store all sorts of things on it.
5,Great for Vacations,"I purchased the 2 gig card so whene I go on vacation I can take all the photos I want ,without worrying about running out of storage."
1,sd card,"must have been a bad lot of these cards because it never worked and I still have it never went to trouble to send back, maybe if they read review they will repalce"
5,SanDisk SD 2GB memory card,"This product fits my needs perfectly. It fits all 3 of my digital cameras as well as a thumb drive and card reader for my PC. This is a big help as I don't have a USB cable for one of the cameras and can just pull the card out. I like the 2GB size because I don't like to store too many images before transferring them, and I can use separate cards for different projects. I've always found SanDisk products perfectly reliable and it's my brand of choice when purchasing items of this nature, and buying 4 cards at Amazon was cheaper by far than buying 1 locally J. Graper"
4,Expensive shipping!!!,It's shocking to find out that the shipping cost is more than the total cost of the items.I wish I had known before I purchased the items. I should have looked elsewere. I'll never do that again.
1,"Two Occassions, That's It","I have a copy of this album and I don't understand the price that these sellers are asking for it. The price for a used copy is ridiculous at the time that I write this review. A new copy is way, way less. What's the Deele? Going back to the review, I didn't really care for the rest of the tracks. I purchased this cd because of the song, Two Occasions, which I grew up listening to. I liked the keyboard work on that song and it did not disappoint in that area. The rest of the tracks though did not interest me. I have to say that I did not hear the other tracks before so I need to let it grow on me. So far, though, I don't care to listen to the whole album. As a big fan of Babyface, I still would not purchase this album. I would never sell my copy for the ridiculous price that these other sellers are listing it for. To me it is highway robbery. Shame on them."
3,Not what I had expected,"After reading the other readers' reviews of this book I was expecting great things. However, I was dissappointed with the story line, which was merely a listing of a little girl's favorite stuffed toys, but even more dissapointed with the illustrations, which were simple at best. We will read it- but only because of the lack of truly great French materials for young children."
5,Fantastic!,This is a must have in any music collection! All music masters on this wonderful CD! Music heven.Introduce yourself to these true jazz kings.
1,Bare Bones Biography,"This bare bones biographical note about Feldenkrais is about 250 words long. It mentions that he wrote six books about his method but does not name them.If you are interested in a basic discussion of the ""Feldenkrais method"", save your money and look at the Wikipedia article on this topic."
4,Bachata - The Hottest Sound in Latin Music Right Now!,"Salsa is still hot, Merengue is even hotter, but Bachata is the music that's really happening right now! Originating in the Dominican Republic, it is relatively underground in the USA and is the latin music for those, ""In the know.""Fausto Rey's BACHATA A MEDIA VOZ is a very solid CD of bittersweet bachatas, and it is that bittersweet quality (""el amarague"") that makes bachata music so unique, so special. Included are traditional merengues like ""Pero Ya Se te Olvido"" (""You Already Forgot"") that add a variety to the overall musical selection. A highly recommended bachata CD. - Musikid"
5,"Unless you're an idiot, you will NOT regret buying this!","Wow. I'm not certain any elucidation on my part here can accurately convey the beauty of this recording, both for its artistic richness and quality of production. Mr. Lanois certainly has the Midas touch. From his award-winning production for Peter Gabriel, U2, Robbie Robertson, and many others. This first album of his is a must have for anyone's collection."
2,boring journey,"maybe this book is just dated (im being generous). it kinda reminds me of Nash's unfortunate traveller or anatomy of melancholy only less entertaining. naw, more like those essays in the tabloids from the era like the tattler - not even that good really. there are some moments of being clever but never truly brilliant or entertaining.I realy wanted to read shandy but that dreaful film ruined my ability to get past the first page - i guess i need to wait until the bad after taste is gone. whatever - journey is truly forgettable - not worth the time whatsoever. i probably should only give it one star."
4,Superb Americana,"Goldmine Pickers is superb contemporary Americana string band music. It's not Bluegrass or Old Time, but draws from both as well as Newgrass, Folk, Irish. A mixture of vocal songs and instrumental tunes. Highly recommended."
1,This seat sucks!,"Don't buy this seat for the price! It defiantely has a lowered look, but when i say that you will throw all comfort away...I'm not exagerating! It feels like you are sitting right on your tailbone and I can handle some discomfort for looks, but spend the extra 100 bucks and get a Mustang or Corbin! Trust me you won't regret it, but buying this one you will!"
1,Low Sugar NOT Low Carb!,"The recipes in this book use potatoes, corn starch, corn meal, pasta and other high carb ingredients. For example, one recipe calls for 3 1/2 cups of flour, another calls for 6 flour tortillas and 1/4 cup refried beans.The authors of this cookbook believe in low sugar, but are for all complex carbohydrates.If you are trying to lose weight on ANY of the low carb diets, this cookbook will be of little use to you, and will, in fact sabotage your efforts. The average carb counts are high on most of the recipes, and are equally high on the side dishes (one serving of a main dish and a side would average 40 carbs). One dish claims to have 150 grams of carbohydates...There are MANY great low carb cookbooks right here on Amazon, this just isn't one of them."
1,Misleading Title,"The introduction is pretty standard for a low-carb cookbook, however, the recipes are not what you would expect. Sugar is used a lot. There is a whole section on Pasta, and I don't mean the low carb variety. The author does admit that many recipes were categorized as low carb by adjusting the portion size. I suppose that one bite of anything is low-carb by this definition.There are so many better cookbooks out there on this topic. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Seriously?,"This is not a low-carb cookbook. The recipes have carb counts, but no explanation as to whether that is for total carbs, or if it is ""useable carbs."" If you're on a low-carb diet, stay away from this book! In flipping through, I noticed recipes including bread, pasta, flour, cornmeal, honey, and sugar...yes, SUGAR. Major disappointment. Go for500 Low-Carb Recipes: 500 Recipes from Snacks to Dessert, That the Whole Family Will Loveinstead."
3,Disappointed in overall package...,"While the player itself is easy to use and works well, the earbuds that came with it are garbage. One set quit working after 3 days and within a week the other set fell apart."
5,Gem of a recording by an unknown singer.,"Cormac McCarthy is an obscure New England folkie with only two CDs to his credit, but he is also one of the most fascinating and listenable musicians in my collection. I'm especially fond of this debut album.McCarthy, a former English major, is highly literate and gifted at storytelling. He presents evocative imagery and finely drawn characterization. ""Waltz With the Captain's Daughter"" is a short story compressed into one fascinating and beautiful song. But my favorite is the poignant and lyrical ""When My Boat Is Built Again,"" a song with an odd power to bring me to tears.McCarthy has an exceptionally likable and resonant voice. His guitar work is good, although the excellent pedal steel accompaniment on ""When My Boat Is Built Again"" is not his.This is one of the most treasured albums in my collection. I don't know why he hasn't come out with a third album, but I'll be eternally grateful he gave us this one!"
3,"A Masterpiece, but not for the DTS version","Either I'm crazy or there are some major problems with this DTS version. Let me first say that this is an incredible album. It's essentially a flawless record. It covers all facets and is Lyle's finest record. Now the part that's killing me. There are MAJOR flaws with this transfer. Backing vocals completely eliminated on Church, Guitar tracks missing on You've Been So Good Up Til Now. It kills me know these are missing. A simple A/B comparison with the CD version and you'll hear it. More backing vocals eliminated on The Last Time. Somebody tell me that it's just my copy and I'll track down another to make up for this. I'd give it 10 stars if they had just gotten the transfer correct."
4,Another Great Release from Lyle,"Starting off this set is the bouncy-pianoed ""I've Been to Memphis"", which is one of my favorite Lyle Lovett songs. The next song you feel like you've stepped into a predominately black church with ""Church"", which to me, is a masterpiece of vocal arrangements. It is a very fun song. Then, later you come to the brilliantly written ""North Dakota"", with incredible backup vocals by Rickie Lee Jones. I also very much love the ""Flyswatter"" song... what can I say, this is a great release from a highly talented man."
4,Great admiration for Thich Nhat Hanh...,"I have a great respect for Thich Nhat Hanh and the many works that he has done in his years with us. This book is another example of his striving to present the joys of Zen to the western world. His poetry, charity, and daily life reflect a pattern of mindfulness that many will never experience. I fear though, as he states, that the Western world will not be able to fully grasp Oriental Zen practice, and a western form of it has arisen. I appreciate the book's simplicity, and honesty. May peace be with you today..."
4,Peace,This beautiful man is all peace. He is a living example of what he teaches. He is a man living what he believes and teaching it to who ever wants to be a part of the tranquility that he espouses. That does not mean that Hahn is telling us that it is easy. But he is giving us great guidelines of how to achieve what he believes in. I see this man as another Gandhi. Hanh believes that all can be changed as long as we are able to work through our own anger and get to a place of peace that can then permeate the world.How good would that be!Dr. Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
5,Car top carrier - used without car rack,We bought a PackRight carrier for a trip where we were going to have two more passengers that would have more luggage than our car could hold. We were able to store 4 suitcases and 3 camp chairs with room to spare. During our two week trip we had a day when we used the carrier and it rained all day long. When we opened up the car top carrier all the items in it were dry and safe.
4,sturdy and well made,"Choice between PVC lined, keeping contents dry, and environmentally friendly nylon was a no-brainer. Works ok but not optimally with an aftermarket roof rack on a Versa hatch. Straps easy enough to figure out. Buy a small luggage lock for peace of mind on the road to lock the zippers together.Takes a couple of trips to figure out the best way to load, but it does accommodate quite a bit and freed up my trunk so that I had some space to play with.Also folds down nicely and fits in a small bag, so can even be carried on a vacation to use with rental car--straps work with no rack as well. Very versatile product."
4,Worked great,"We used this on our Mazda 3 5 door. We got the clips, but unfortunately they don't work on the mazda, so we had to the run the straps through the doors. It worked great. The straps don't get in the way at all. There was a lot more storage inside than we imagined. As luck would have it, it rained the first time used it and everything stayed perfectly dry. All in all we couldn't have asked for more."
2,Wind tore the cover,We packed the soft carrier pretty full but the contents shifted back a little once underway. We could see it through the moonroof andthe carrier seemed to be slipping backwards. We have an SUV with top rails but not cross rails. When we arrived we discovered that the top tore in several places on the backside of the load. Not near any straps so it must have been the wind force. It was worrysome on the road to wonder about it. May not use it again. Would not recommend unless you have crossrails on your car and use bungee cords too.
1,Poor Quality,"We were excited about this item, but sorely disappointed! Right after receiving it we put it on our car, got ready to head to Yellowstone, lightly tugged on the strap to slide it so that it was centered on the roof (and I do need to mention that it was not fully packed or even strapped down yet), when the stitching came undone and the plastic ring, meant to hold all the weight and force of holding it on the roof, fell off. There was no way to attach it after that. If the strap couldn't handle such a small tug, there was no way it would have be able to handle a stronger tug to make sure it was tight enough to stay on the roof!"
1,Rightline Gear 100S10 PackRight Sport 1 Car Top Carrier,It was too hard to pack either on top of the car or packing things in it beforehand and THEN trying to hoist it on top of the car. Strapping it tightly was also difficult. I would NOT buy this product again.
3,Worked well but...,"Worked well to move stuff from Washington to Michigan. However, the zippers are terrible. There wouldn't be any pressure on them and they would just come apart. We also needed to buy more straps to feel comfortable with it. Overall good, just needs some improvements."
5,great movie series,i grew up watching these movies and when my son started being crazy about dinosaurs i knew i had to get these movies they are great!
2,Save Your Money For Something Else! By The Z,"As the title suggests: Save your money for something else. This episode was terrible! Oh sure, bringing Chomper back and having his singing debut was okay but the songs were pathetically annoying especially ""Big Water"" and ""Friends for Dinner"". The only thing that made this episode interesting was the song ""Always here"" This is the only song that actually teaches you something. I'm still trying to figure out what kind of stuff the producer was thinking when he gave this episode the okay. But besides that, the plot was great."
5,Super!,"Super! ******My grandson love his movies. was deliver on time as stated, moveis look great, have no bad thing to say.******"
1,The Land before Time V - The Mysterious Island,"Although this was the DVD that we were looking for , it is not possible to play it because it comes up as 'wrong region'. It would have been helpful if I had been made aware which region it was"
4,Very cute little movie,"For every Land Before Time video I buy, it seems to appeal to me every time, and this one is no exception. In this film, ""swarming leaf gobblers"" (grasshoppers) eat up all the food in the Great Valley. This means that all the dinosaurs will have to move. :( Soon, the grown-ups start fighting (again) about where they should go to find more food. Of course, Littlefoot and his friends try and solve the problem by setting of on another journey to find food themselves. And they find it, on an island. The rest of the story follows up with a ""return of Chomper"" part in it, a t-rex chase (of course), and ""peace on dino earth"" (a happy ending). Over-all, it's a cute movie that kids of all ages are sure to love."
4,This is one I'll watch with my kids!,"My children and I adore this movie! And it is one I will watch with them. The story is a cut above the usual kid fare, and the lessons within are clear and straightforward, yet not as traumatic and frightening as in other movies from this series. Even better, the songs are enjoyable and catchy! I have even caught my husband singing, ""Friends for Dinner"" while cooking. But then I am guilty of singing ""Big, Big, Big, Big Water"" while bathing the kids! We enjoy this ""Land Before Time"" movie more than others in this series. We think you will, too!"
5,Kids (of all ages) love this movie!,"My girls are 3 & 4 years old. My 3 year old asks to watch a movie from this series at least once every other day! This one has catchy tunes ""Big Water"" and ""Friends for Dinner"" that even my husband and I sing along with! My husband & I don't mind watching this one with the girls, it's entertaining! It teaches kids how to work together...and a few other life lessons. It's a keeper! I recommend it, and all of the movies in this series.1smileycat :-)"
4,Prodigious! Amazing! But...,"Prodigious! Amazing! But some songs always make me cry like ""Always There."" It always makes me cry. In that song, LittleFoot and his friends reflect on their parents. Hinting from the first movie when LittleFoot reflects about his mother. I have seen all 6 movies and I like all of them except the first one. It's the saddest of them all. When I mean sad, I mean crying sad. Once I saw that movie, BAM! The waterworks were on! I want a seventh movie! My little brother imagines that the last movie will be when the asteroid hits the earth and sometime cavemen come! He has a nice imagination. The land before time is appearing in commercials. Hinting on the next movie..."
5,Older than America,I loved this movie. it gives you a general idea of life for the native americans in the early years. a very eye opening movie. I see something new each time I watch it.
3,It was okay,"I was really looking forward to watching this film, and watched it with some family members. It was very slow moving, actually boring for the teenage family members, who left after only 20 minutes. It was okay, and interesting, but some of the background music was way too loud. It was difficult to hear what the actors were saying in some instances. I guess I was expecting it to be more than it was."
4,Interesting story and spotty acting,"The title of the movie gives us a curiousity of what the story has to do with the title. This is a painful story yet one that needs to be told in a variety of venues. The setting was excellent and given the more current social and cultural context, there is relevance to the health, relational, spiritual and tribal impact; Adam Beech, Wes Studi and Tantoo Cardinal's acting was at times, excellent and others, just fair; The inclusion of Dennis Banks was a plus to this movie. Georgenia Lightning was excellent as was her Mom. I would recommend this movie to all;"
5,My favorite CD...,"What an amazing album. Ken's first full-length album is simply awesome. His lyrics are fresh and funky, with great work from his whole band. His voice is mellow and unique, and I find myself enjoying every single song. It's been a long time since I've heard something this cool. I highly recommend this album, so much, in fact, that I'm buying copies for all my friends. I haven't stopped listening to it yet. This is an awesome CD!"
3,Not the best for the smaller clamps,"The price was right on this one. I have a 91 Honda with approx 1/2 inch ID coolant hoses and 3/4 inch heater hose. I think this is fairly standard for many cars. These pliers have trouble getting down to that smallest size and cannot lock down at that size, as they are at their smallest setting. I got the job done but would rather have not ""cheaped out"". The Craftsman pliers look better, but I have not tried them.Therse work well on larger clamps, but if you have small ones, I would spent a few more dollars on a better pair."
5,Low cost and works,Works great and indispensible if you have hose clamps near the firewall. Could not have changed my heater core without it. Squeeze it and it locks in place.
5,The Greatest As Irons Go!!,"I have had the Europro Open Handle Iron for over a year. It is the greatest iron that I have ever owned. I bought it at a local ""box"" store and was upset when I went, just to get a back up in case the present one ever quit on me, and they don't carry it anymore. Happy to see Amazon has it and will order one immediately.Irons with little effort and the steam setting is awesome."
1,I would never buy this iron again.,"This iron worked okay but less than a year after I bought it, I was ironing one day and smelled a burning smell, then sparks started to fly out of the area where the cord joins the iron. After I had unplugged it, I could see that the cord had come apart and there were exposed wires. I have been using irons for over 40 years and nothing like this has every happened before. I will never buy an iron made in China again, NEVER.Joanne, Aurora, CO"
1,Mighty sorry,"The dvd box advertises that it contains three episodes with MIghty Mouse. The exact words on the back of the slip case are ""Mighty Mouse is featured in 'Wolf Wolf,' 'Goofy Goofy Gander' and 'Bars and Stripes Forever' along with other cartoons. . ."" It contains one and only one Mighty Mouse cartoon 'Wolf Wolf.' I do not object to the poor quality copy but others might find it unacceptable. For some reason my dvd contains a second, even worse, copy of 'Wolf Wolf.'"
1,Edited mouse doings?,"I was surprised and disappointed by this product; someone saw fit to edit certain parts of it out; my memory is such I could clearly see that. With this problem, together with the iffy print quality, I would definitely say that this was not worth its purchase price..."
1,Mighty Bad!,"What you get is one Mighty Mouse cartoon and then a bunch of poor copies of other no name cartoons. Granted, these others are all from the Fleisher factory and have a certain level of quality about them, but they are in rotten condition. The Mighty Mouse cartoon really isn't any better. You're wasting even the little bit of money you'd spend on this. Oh, when will they ever come out with a comprehensive Mighty Mouse CD!!?? Mighty Mouse, where are you???"
2,V E R Y S L O W,"Mostly narrated and in Black and White. I was expecting a ""highly commical"" video. It took me 3 days to get through the movie. I had to keep turning it off out of boredom."
3,Not much to it,"Al B. Sure's sophmore album did not live up expectations put forth after his first album. I hate to give anything by Al B. Sure a low rating, but this isn't a great album, and he proved in his first CD that he has the ability to do much better.I was also disspointed that the mix of ""Misunderstanding"" that I heard on the radio was not what was on this CD. This happens a lot these days, and it was the only reason I bought ""Private Times & the Whole 9"".Al B. Sure's rendition of ""Hotel California"" is worth a listen. If you are already a fan of Al B. Sure, you will appreciate it, however those unfamiliar with his style might be turned off."
3,I Just Don't Know...,"The second project from a man who blew everybody's mind with his first effort, In Effect Mode. But on this particular one, I can't say the same. I was searching for some of the same things from his first album but came up short. And the only song that drew my attention was the duet with Motown's own, Diana Ross (a ballad that paints a very romantic picture of a cougar and a young buck)...LOL."
5,The whole R&B,"Ah...finally I found this great CD. I am slowly running out of words in making comments but still feel the urge to do so. I am collecting all CDs by artists whose work I really like, and Al B Sure is one of them. This CD takes me back to the early 1990s and it is a great R&B/Swing CD."
3,Developing nicely.,"Brian Michael Bendis, Powers: Roleplay (Image, 2001)Bendis continues his series with this second collection. The story: our intrepid detectives, Christian Walker and Deena Pilgrim, are sent to investigate the almost-simultaneous deaths of a number of college students. The catch: the college students, who don't have powers, are roleplaying superheroes. (In this world, wearing a superhero costume, if you're not a power, is illegal.)Like Who Killed Retro Girl?, Roleplay stands as its own book, though you'll get more of what's going on between Christian and Deena if you've read the first book. Either way, though, Powers is a series worth checking out. The writing is good-- the best I've ever seen from Bendis-- and the artwork is right up the alley of traditional superhero comics, but with enough modern differences to keep things interesting.Get to know Powers; you won't regret it. ***"
4,As good as Le Creuset?,I bought this in August and have used it a dozen times. It works beautifully for braising and oven roasting. If it's still unscratched in a year's time I'd give it a fifth star and a rousing YES (at less than half the price!) to the question in the title.
4,nice & compact,"These are handy to have for wildlife viewing. Light, compact,with a good field of view. Eight power is enough magnification for woodland use on the East coast. Very happy with the purchase."
2,"I Married Joan, Volume 1","I saw Joan Davis in ""Hold That Ghost"" with Abbott and Costello. In that film she was very good, and very funny. I assumed ""I Married Joan"" would also be great. Mistake, and I blame it on the low budget type methods, and writers. This series was supposed to be the tv networks answer to ""I Love Lucy"". It failed by far, to meet that type show. Jim Backus was odd in this series, and lacked the humor spark that he had years later in ""Gilligan's Island"". Nope, I wouldn't reccommend this series to anybody, and really don't blame Joan Davis either."
4,Africa in my head,"I don't know what your image of Africa is, but my isn't the one of safaris, endless sky, magnificent nature, etc. Although I am sure that that too is Africa, in my mind Africa has always been the continent of struggle, street life ,and the ultimate will to survive and live the life to the fullest. Why this introduction? Because when you buy this CD, it won't make you think of Kenya, Karen Blixen, wild life, Lion King, etc. It will introduce you to the reality of life in Africa,the struggles, the streets, the clubs, the night life, nostalgia ,poverty and the artistry that is so often not appreciated or understood in the west. I loved the Cd, not all of it , though. It features many artists from the golden age of Africa pop, the 70's among them: Salif Kaita, Omar Pene, and of course Yusou N'dur. Some of the songs were not so great, but early N'dur or Omar Pene are definitely gems worth listening to."
1,arrived broken,"I ordered this mirror from the seller gohastings. The mirror arrived broken. It was packaged very poorly- not wrapped in bubble wrap, only had some paper thrown in the box with it."
3,eh...,"The first one I received was broken, but returning was very easy. The second one arrived very dirty, but otherwise fine."
2,By Reputation,"This book will be of interest only to people who desire information on President Lincoln's reputation just before and during his terms in office. It is not a general history of the man or the era. Professor Trefousse's aim is to give a multitude of specific quotes from the time extolling President Lincoln to rebut the supposed thought he was almost universally disparaged before his assasination lifted him to martyrdom. To me, it is a book on which most avid readers about Abraham Lincoln can afford to give a pass."
5,Amazed,"I was shocked to find this movie on here, still avaliable to buy. I was in this movie five years ago when I was 9 years old. I was an extra in the film, during the baseball game when they showed the crowds. Everyone in my family can be seen at one point or another, so this movie means a lot to me. I don't remember much about the movie, since I was young when I saw it, but I definately recommend it to anyone of any age."
3,Cute but no substance,"This book is really general. While it may help answer a couple of questions an owner may have about Parakeets, a more comprehensive book would be better. But, it is an entertaining half-hour read for someone who does not need this as her sole reference."
4,Fun and cute book!,"This book has adorable and hilarious illustrations. While the info is true, I would recommend this for beginning budgie owners only. The book was a little smaller than I expected, but all in all, it's a fun book that can help answer questions you may have had for a long time. Happy Reading! :-)"
1,Not even worth half a star,This book is a total waste of time and money. It tells you nothing more and considerably less than a $2.00 pamphlet like book from any variety store. The author seems to think they are very cute and clever. They are wrong! Don't waste your money on this thing.
1,bath tub soap dish,"I did not understand the 4 inch tub size in the write-up and ordered this. It was too big to fit on my new walk-in bath tub. We were not able to make it fit so would have liked to return it, but the company turned down my request to return it. Perhaps it should be mentioned to sit horizontal the walls of the tub must be at least 4 inches."
3,Pretty good,"Pros:-quick and easy to install-inexpensive-buttons on the wheel for easy accessCons:-only turns 90 degrees = hard to control the car-wheel is a bit smallNote: For some games, the pedal doesn't work ie. need for speed most wantedBottom Line: This is a fairly good wheel that is for a casual gamer. Get this if you don't play often. Otherwise, you are better off looking for another wheel."
4,Good after some hassle,"The setup works great for both PC and PS2. BUT....it was a gift and when it arrived the lap adapter was not in the box. Disappointment to my son. After a couple phone calls, they finally agreed to send a new lap adapter which arrived about a week later. Would be 5 stars if they would have included the lap adapter to start."
2,"Cheap price, cheap result","This wheel is very cheap but it wasn't as good as I though. First, the wheel is very small...too small. Barely larger then a Xbox controller. The attachment area between the socket and the wheel seems fragile...Not sure it's gonna last very long. Mine is already slightly loose after a couple of hours of play. No support for Win7, and it shows up in the games. The feeling is king of imprecise, like playing with a keyboard. Even a gamepad is more fun to play!!The pedals are the worst. They are too hard, and the base too light. The pedals are too near. So it either moves by itself or you touch two pedals at times, and you always have to push hard on them to react in the game. Are the creators of these things never drove a car with pedals ?The only good things is has is the look, easy to grip and the clamp is reasonable. Otherwise I wasted my money on this, don't waste yours..."
2,Genius Twin Vibration Feedback F1 Racing Wheel,"The design is very nice. Fit nicely on your lap if you can get it to work. Wheel assembled and connected to PC, installed software. I ran F1-2011, NFS-Hot Pursuit, and Burnout Paradise, none could detect it. My OS is winXP 32 bit. No good."
1,It's not working in my Windows7 32 bit PC,I brought it yesterday and since then I am trying with different racing games. Driver got installed successfully but nothing seems to me functional.Can anyone let me know how to understand if it is working.
4,Good product for a great price,"Hey - come on. This is a $30 steering wheel in a world of $100 plus items. It is great, no. Is it for the NASCAR fan who spends hours a day playing, no.This is a perfect item for someone who plays racing games from time to time, wants something small and compact, functions perfectly, costs significantly less but is built very well.I have purchased two Thrustmaster wheels in the past and they started to break in a couple months to the point where no buttons or paddles worked with a year.You cannot go wrong with this item for the price."
4,"A good intro wheel, get what you pay for","I was curious about the world of racing wheels, and having never owned one I didn't want to go the 300 dollar route and decided to get this wheel with the intention of seeing if I really enjoyed racing games enough to get a better one.I find the wheel to be too small, just kind of makes it feel like a toy. The hardware driver support is weak, its out there but took me forever to get some vibration in game. Never managed any force feedback, but just tried a couple of need for speed games with it and its very possible I just missed a setting somewhere.All in all its a fine wheel for playing around, and I have had enough fun with it to teach me that I want the real deal someday. After beating NFS Shift and trying a few other racers I haven't used it much, it provided a solid couple of weekends of entertainment and was worth the price but now'll maybe bundle it up with an old ps/2 and try to sell it."
2,great but which games are compatible?,I got this wheel and downloaded GTI Racing from Amazon for the PC. I just can't them to work with each other... very annoying
2,its not what you think,there is no feed back no vibration if you are looking for a vibration feed back this is not what you want dont wast your money
2,Do not recommend - perhaps good for young children only,"I was very disappointed wit this wheel. It connects rather easily, but there is not enough power to have good force feedback. Somehow, the settings applied to use the wheel with the games made the game very very choppy and slow. Not sure what the glitch was but overall I was very disappointed.If you need this for a very young kid who wouldn't notice the slowness or the lack of realism, then it's a good gift for the price."
1,Strongly dislike city electronics customer support,"I ordered this steering wheel believing that it would be a little bit bigger, and compatible with my xbox 360. When i found that it wasn't i contacted Amazon and city electronics. When i spoke with city electronics they told me that i would need to pay extra shipping costs on the product and it couldn't be reimbursed with the refund. Also they are not the nicest people. I refuse to order from them again."
4,Outstanding value for the occasional gamer...,"Bought this wheel and pedals while my son was visiting, and boy did we ever get my money's worth out of it! We had a blast playing all his driving games on the PS2. And the USB connection, well, I've got to get the PC set back up in my new office room, but I'm dying to put it to the PC game test... but in the meantime, I've played more PS2 lately than anytime since getting home from overseas. (Soldiers play a LOT of games on off-duty time!)Loved it, even considered buying a second one so we could go head to head on even terms... oh well... maybe for Christmas."
2,Compact & Small But...,"It does not have support for many PC Racing simulations. I bought this so that I could play Race 07 from Simbin, but was disappointed when it was not supported. Before purchasing the wheel, it states that Race 07 was supported, but it is not.It is small and compact, which I love considering that I don't have a lot of room for a huge Wheel. It does work with the 18 Wheels of Steel games, DiRT, DiRT2, and Grid, but just not with Race 07.Still overall a good cheap inexpensive purchase on a wheel."
1,misrepresentation,I placed an order on Dec-10 and received a delivery estimate of Dec 14-17. As of today Dec-31 the Christmas gift still has not arrived. I have no merchant updates on the expected delivery date. I would not order from this merchant again nor recommend them to anyone else. I would give them a zero star rating if I could but this system does not allow for it.
1,Everything fine - until it stopped working,"I was actually quite happy with this camcorder for the first 3 months that I had it. Then one day (of course after the 90 day warranty on labor provided by Sharp) the thing stopped working, probably having short-circuited somehow. Sharp, it appears, has only two service outlets in the whole country which charge a minimum of [$$$] for labor plus shipping etc. Needless to say, as long as the product quality is as low as it appears, it might soon become an expensive experience. I DO NOT recommend this product to other customers."
2,Decent camera when it works,"Two weeks after I bought it the camera will not play back what I record. The only way I know it actually captured anything is that it will play back if you hit play and fast forward. This means that I can not get what I have recorded off the MiniDV tape and I can not show anyone what I have recorded! Until it stopped working the camera was awesome, especially for the price."
2,Stopped working,"I too like many others liked the camera the first 3 months, but then one day I went to use the camera and it wouldn't turn on.It's like it short curciuted. Of course it happend right after the 3 month warrenty was up. They will fix it for a heavy labor charge. I would not recommend purchacing this camera at all. To top it all off the customer service reps were very rude."
2,Another One Bites the Dust,"Like many others here, my camera also suddenly stopped working one day. I've had the camera exactly 2 years and have taped about 16 hours total. I also have taken very good care of it - never been dropped or damaged in any way. The Sharp-recommended repair facility wanted $40 just to look at it. I opted to send it to a facility that does free estimates... just learned it will cost $225 to fix the power source. Even though the repair shop will guarantee everything for 6 mos, we will likely spend a little extra just to buy a newer, better camera."
3,"Good band, bad name.","This is one of those great late 80's alternative bands I liked, similar to The Church, Echo and the Bunnymen, or The Ocean Blue. Not really punk or goth, but dark pop. These guys fashion was like the clean-cut Ramones, on this album anyway. Guitar, some horn, and good enough singing and lyrics. ""Where do we go from heaven"" and ""Second time around"" are both great songs. They do have a ""hits"" album out, which I would actually get before this if I was new to the band. But this is a good example of the 1989 alt-scene too."
1,Red Barn Mailbox,"The customer service and shipping from this company were excellent!I guess I didn't believe the other reviews and thought I would get one of the ""good"" ones. I was so disappointed because you need a crobar and leather gloves to get the door open. The knob has very sharp points and the door is almost impossible to open. I was going to try to fix it but I don't think the door fits properly and the latch isn't fixable. I'm sorry I had to return it because I don't think the mailman could get it open."
5,Best Product and Price Around!,Great mailbox that will hold up to anything (except a baseball bat used by neighborhood delinquents). Replaces the same mailbox that I have used for 10+ years. It also is an easy landmark for guests that are looking for our house. The Red Barn style is quite distinctive.
2,Barn Mailbox plus/minus,"This mail box looks great and assembled nicely, but it is hard to open and close"
1,Safety Issues?,"This is a cute little teether but after a few months of use the paint is beginning to chip off the caterpillar part. I don't know where this toy was made, but considering the recent problems with lead paint on toys I tossed this one just to be safe."
5,Neat gadget!,"I like using this while cleaning my chain. I've cleaned chains for many years without one. But having it removes slack from the chain and makes the job a tad easier. ""Must-have?"" No! ""Nice to have?"" You bet!"
2,I wouldn't use this on a carbon frame.,"What I don't like about this unit is that it attaches to the right dropout only and hence is not very secure. This might be ok for metal bike frames, but risky for carbon fiber - it not only puts more stress on the right dropout, but an accidental bump can damage the rear right triangle..A better solution would be to include a skewer that clamps to both dropouts just like a wheel. The Nashbar Chain Master works this way, costs about the same and works with 130/135/160mm spacing. For an even better (albeit pricy) product look into the BBB BTL-50 Chain Grip (130mm) for road bikes and BTL-51 Chain Grip (135mm) for mountain bikes."
1,Obtuse reading;,"This book has some information that is useful, however most of what I needed to know was difficult to find and implement. The lack of useful guidance with clear cut reasoning for milestone steps was frustrating (i.e. organization naming and bringing in additional domains into your empty root that have existing Exchange organization). Buying this book was not the best use of our limited funds!"
4,Excelente libro para dormir a los kids,"A mis chicos le encanto este cuento. Es muy gracioso y facil de leer. Las paginas son delicadas, es lo unico negativo."
1,The worst of Ofra Haza.,"Having bought Shaday and Kirya by miss Haza, i bought Desert Wind with the notion that it would be as fantastic as the aforementioned. Boy was i wrong. Gone are the heavy Yemenite/Israeli beats and flavor, as is Haza singing in Hebrew. Instead, I found her beautiful voice swallowed up by abhorrent 80's synth-pop cheese and benal lyrical content, with Hebrew only in the chorus at most. There is not a single song, with the exception of ""Slave Dream"" that I could bear to listen to all the way through, and most of the songs are laughably bad. So, fans of Haza's other works, do yourself a favor and save your [money] and buy Shaday or Kirya. Unless you want a good laugh, then by all means, purchase away!"
3,Concert Recording spoils some effect,"Of the two tracks, the first one has a lot of applauding going on in the background .... spoiling the legitimate gaps in the composition. Makes it very irritating to listen to this piece.The second track has an accompanist filling in at some notes.Takes away the grandeur of a pure ""Mansur"" treat."
5,los pinguos - great live band,"When I first saw this band playing on the street at Third St Promenade in Santa Monica I couldn't tear myself away. They are amazingly energized and you can tell they are having a great time while they play. Have gone back to see them several times and also saw them at Temple Bar the night they were recording for the Live album.Okay, so I admit I also have a crush on the lead singer. . . Anyway, I highly recommend checking this band out."
2,Not so good...,"As a dedicated bike commuter, I need and use a lot of lights. This one seemed like a great deal (and it's a Planet Bike, which are usually well thought out products), but it turned out not to be so. It doesn't seal at all, it has holes in the casing, and any moisture at all causes it to either A) stay on permanently, B) run down the batteries, C) completely disable the switch. I got about one year out of it before the rains destroyed it."
2,Not sturdy,"I had problems with this light not staying in the mount. Finally it came apart while riding at 25mph scattering parts and batteries to unknown locations. I didn't hit a bump or anything, the case just opened up and sent parts in various directions. It won't work well for lighting your route, but as a flashing light pointed at oncoming traffic it gets attention. It is cheap for a reason!"
2,24 Hours,"I received this light last Wednesday, rode home from work that night, and while riding back to work the next morning (after about 10 miles and less than a day of life) the light joined the ranks of the other suicide jumpers people have apparently encountered with this model, popping off the bracket while riding probably 12mph down a smooth road. Slightly frustrating.The design overall is also far inferior to that of the 3LED Beamer, which I'd had previously but was stolen. The Beamer is most definitely worth the bit of extra money."
4,So Far So Good,"This light isn't the brightest thing on the planet. But I bought it in part, because it's a planet bike light and they contribute to cycling communities. Also I use it primarily as a flasher, which gets the attention of people driving by. It's street legal, so for those of you that can afford anything else, but don't want to get a ticket here's your light.I use this light as part of my night riding equipment. I also use Planet bike red blinkies, )]]Planet Bike Blinky Super Flash 1/2-Watt Blaze LED Plus 2 eXtreme LED Rear Bicycle LightDown Low Glow by Fossil Fool.Down Low Glow Lighting Kit - Two Tubes -Ice(blue), and illuminite leg & arm warmers Performance illumiNITE Leg Warmers"
4,Bright little devil,"I think this little ""bright beast"" do great thing for one and less for the other. I personally love it. I have no issue to open it for battery change and the battery for me seems last forever. I also do not have any issue with falling apart. I can't comment about the rain, because if I can help it I don't ride in the rain. I can't recommend as a main front light source either. More like a secondary light that warns drivers that you are also on the road and for that especially in flashing mode do a fantastic job. Just for alone that is worth it. I recommend cutting out a piece of ribbon out of an old bicycle rubber tube and rap around the bicycle handle before you place the light's bracket on. That way you never will have any problem for secure fit."
2,better ones out there for the money,"I agree with previous reviewers that this light doesn't mount securely. I was riding my bike around 15mph when I hit a bump and it fell off and got smashed. The light actually fell off several times before that even during slow city riding.Also, the light itself is too dim even for commuter riding. The light cast by this has a very narrow range. Any time of night riding outside of well lit city streets is not possible, and even in city streets the light source is relatively dim so you'll be overshadowed by all the surrounding light. There are some much better lights for just a tad extra $."
2,not what i expected,"i bought this light mainly for a friend, and i'm not sure if it's my fault for lack of reading...but i expected something different. Mainly it had to do with the battery. I thought it would hold a regular size battery but it doesn't. So now i hope the battery has a decent life span as i don't even know where to find it, seems like it requires special ordering via the internet"
3,Lots of footage,Good narration of the developement of this tank. Lots of footage but mostly short segments. Would have liked to see more interior views and walk around views of museum pieces or even traning films from the war.
4,Creating Your Family Heritage Scrapbook,"I received this book for Christmas and have already read several of the chapters... if you are new to genealogy or scrapbooking this is the book for you. My only complaint is that the authors jumped around too much with the lay-out of the book. There are ""mini-articles"" in the middle of chapters, so you have to skip around to read a chapter. Not a book that you can sit and read from cover to cover comfortably."
4,Great Advice for Web Publishing,A great book for those considering putting their genealogy on the Internet. Christian explains the topics simply enough that even those who have little to no knowledge about web publishing and designing web pages can successfully publish their genealogy on the web.
1,Avoid,"I bought this for my Everio GZ-MG50 and I'm very disappointed.The case is too basic. It has room for the camera and one additional small battery, but with the strap on the camera it becomes difficult to fit everything inside the case. There is no additional pockets, so you'll be unable to use it to carry other stuff, like lenses, charger or cables.The battery is the same you get with the camera. It charges quickly but it only gives you an hour or less of recording time. I recommend a larger model as your second battery.Summary: spend your money on some good case with lot of space and a BN-VF714 (2hrs.) or BN-VF733 (5hrs.) battery pack."
2,NOT APPLICABLE TO UNITED STATES,"This is not a useful book.The reason for this is that the author is obviously from England. Therefore, all of the examples and case law that are referenced are based on English law. This is very interesting, but hardly meaningful to someone like myself who works in the contract administration field in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.If you're interested in construction contracts as they relate to English Law, then this is a great source of information. However, if you work in the United States, then this is a worthless reference book!"
2,Not the best from Everlast,"I bought this CD about 4 months ago and I thought it wouldn't be as great as his newer CDs since he was only like 18 years old when he made this CD. But the CD sucked, I mean, it's not the worst but it's not worth [the money]. I LOVE Everlast and I had to buy this CD just to hear how he was. Personally I think it's not worth buying. He doesn't have the deep voice, cool beat, or any of that stuff in this CD. It's all fast, high pitched, and not to rappy."
1,Junk by the CD full! A waste of a CD. Pathetic garbage....,"This is garbage. Everlast is filthy, vile, anti-everything good, and of no worth to the human mind other than to dilute, discourage, cloud, and otherwise weed out any remaing positive feelings and thoughts one may have. How's that for freedom of speech? It's the truth! Not worth the disk it was recorded on. Be careful of what occupies your thoughts.... music is very influential. This influence cannot lead to anything good."
1,BIGGEST EVERLAST FAN EVER READ THIS,I love everlast so much and when i was at the store i found this and thought it would be great see some old skoal everlast but what a crappy cd. i mena no offence to him cause hes my god but this is bull
4,ALWAYS interesting!,"John Adams has created a bizarre masterpiece with this work. I started listening to Adams seven years ago, and from Shaker Loops to Common tones, to Nixon in China to Hodoo Zepyhr, to the violin concerto, and to Gnarly Buttons, the evolution of his musical ideas has been beautiful to listen to. This most recent work extends that evolution. I will not lie. The music, at times, seems...insipid. However, no other modern composer has the sheer audacity to come out with this sort of strange fusion between minimalism, show tunes, opera, jazz, and blues. This album is for anyone who loves Adams music thoroughly. The emotional roller-coaster of tones is here, the voices are magnificent, the story is interesting."
4,A Stunning New Work,"John Adams' works have always been interesting, and with ""Ceiling/Sky"", he once again offers a challenging and original score. Borrowing from classical styles as well as modern rock, jazz, doo-wop, and gospel, Adams' ambitious canvas impresses the listener with its wide musical scope. Even more intriguing is that, with this new work, Adams has written a piece that is much more musical theatre than it is modern opera. Admittedly, there are times when the libretto is dramatically faulty, and most of the white couple's music is rather drab; still, this does not mar the power of most of the score, nor the phenomenal performances. Enjoyable and satisfying, this is one of the best theatre recordings of the year."
2,"Okay, but he's done better","Not the best work from this fine artist. It seems slight indeed in comparison with the Violin Concerto or Grand Pianola Music. Following the amusing but equally slight Gnarly Buttons/Book of Alleged Dances CD, I am ready for a work with some meat on it's bones. File this with Hoodoo Zephyr, as being an entertaining piece, expertly performed, but with little substance. Call it Adams Lite."
2,Uch!,"Is this what we can expect from Mr. Adams in the future? I hope not, he's no match for the folks on Broadway."
3,Interesting but otherwise mediocre,"I always appreciated how dominant LT was on the football field. I never new how screwed up he was off the field. His on-field stories, recounting his approach to the game or his mindset during a play are riveting. Everything else, like his off-field antics, are sophomoric and stupid. This book is interesting, but not particularly well written."
2,"nice images, but...","There is very little text in this book.. it is mainly a coffee table book. The essay is by Ivan Vartanian, who I've never heard of and is not really an academic author or scholar. I found it to be a somewhat shallow and somewhat stereotypical discussion of the artists included. The entries for each artist were also very brief. The images, however speak for themselves, and there are quite a few in this slender book. They included several full-color full-page comics by Aya Takano for example. The images are not really ""definitive"" and they should be supplemental to other reproductions of the artists' works."
4,Sociology of the Internet,"I thought this book was GREAT! Sure, it's dated, but every book about the Internet dates quickly. That's because the Internet is growing and changing faster than the book publishing business can publish a book.The author takes us through many aspects of community building and group dynamics point-by-point. I had to take notes, I found it so useful. Ideas are taken from sociology and applied to the Internet. Dry in parts, yes, but very useful as far as clarifying one's ideas about online communities.As the manager of a small women's community online, I found this book very useful. Much more practical than Amy Jo Kim's similar book, which mainly focuses on the monster-sized for-profit communities.The ideas in this book can be applied to any size online community. It's clear thinking will help you understand participant/leader roles in order to delegate responsibility. There are also wonderful hints for keeping a community thriving and successful."
2,Shows a lack of due dilligence,"As a graduate student in HCI, I found this book to be a travesty. The author did not do her homework when preparing this text, many of her statements were either dated or just incorrect. Professor Preece also has a tendancy for making broad sweeping statements that are for the most part unsupported and questionable.This does not mean the text is completely without use. As a framework for a text on online communities the design of the book is good. Several of the further readings are also worthy of examination.The text is recommended for graduate use. It is much more appropriate for the advanced high school or an introduction to online communites at the undergraduate level.I believe there can and will be a book on online communities with substance and meaning. This book is not it."
3,A little outdated but alright,The internet has changed a lot since this was written but it is still a good book on the basic concepts of Online Communities. I'm not sure if there is a better resource out there yet. I would hope the author would write another version to keep it up-to-date.
5,"The ""making it real"" book","I found this book a great combination of concepts and practical ideas that I know will have a great impact on my work as an online teacher and researcher. I especially appreciate the absolute focus on the interaction between people and how to achieve it (as opposed to person:computer). To me, it puts as all at the heart of what the Internet IS and what it will be. There's something for everyone from commercial to not-for-profit contexts of all kinds. Gilly Salmon."
4,How to make communities,"Hi to everybody, I've recently read this book (in the italian version) for an university exam and I've found it very interesting. It speaks about virtual communities from the poin of view of the designer of this kind on web sites You can read about the two most importat features of VC: socialbility and usability. I've always read about these two elements in an indipendent way. Preece's Book tries to take sociability and usability in a single perspective. And it gives some useful advices to the question of community design."
1,the picture has be changed,i want to buy a autometer shift ligth tacomether and they send me this charger. the picture on the article has be changed :s
5,The best band I have ever seen,"This album marks a turning point in music. Again the world is inundated w/ bad commercial music. This is the complete opposite and the best album I have heard in a long, long time."
3,"Chapters 1 - 5 get 5 stars, other chapters get 1 star","I found that Chapters 1 through 5 (Cominatorial analysis, axioms, Conditional Prob, Discreet RVs, Contious RVs) were very good. Everything else got a little confusing. After reading these later chapters, I found I could complete a little over half of the excercise in these back of these chapters, but some problems I couldn't solve no matter how much time I spent on them. It seemed some excercises were completely different than the examples in the chapters. I'm sure a solutions manual would have cleared everything up though."
2,Very Disappointed,"This book is more of a medical-school textbook describing the major drug categories. It only mentions briefly the principal drugs in each.Although the 4th edition was published in 2005 it does not mention many of the newer drugs like Lexapro,Trileptal, Abilify, Modafinil etc . I did not find the ""User Issues"" text boxes to be an innovation or of much help.This is definitely not a book for quick reference. And it is expensive too!"
3,Could be better,"While the author certainly knows his subject, I found the book difficult to read. He gave too much detail, and often some sentences were difficult to understand. I hope that there are some simpler books than this one out there."
2,Unpleasantly Surprised...:(,"I bought this book with the intent to explore the most sacred hymns and the story behind them. When I received the book, however, I was very disappointed. There is such value in the words of Christophers and yet the publishing company who re-published this 1866 work did a HORRIBLE job! There were typos on every single paragraph and I couldn't distinguish where each hymn and story started or stopped. All the words were squeezed together so you couldn't decipher anything!This seems like a scam to me... knowing that I paid $30 for something that was thrown together by a horrible editing/publishing company. It's not worth the money. I will now be on the lookout for the TRUE and CLEAR version of Christophers book. Please don't waste your money on this. The condition will disappoint you as it did me."
5,A must have!,"Having a toddler it helps with all of the art's and crafts projects from pre-school and also no mess like with other liquid glues, since it isn't liquid on paper and cardboard I get a great finish, great hold on a variety of items...a simple must have for scrapbookers and mommies :-)"
5,Great solution for many craft needs,"I have become a fan of the roll-on glue tape and use it for nearly all my craft projects. I do a lot of paper crafts, card-making, scrapbooking and the like. Once when I was at my mother-in-laws house and ran out of my roll-on glue tape, she gave me a roll of glue dots. I was hooked! I immediately bought a replacement for hers and two more for me on Amazon when I got home. These dots are great for adhering items like pom-poms, fabric, ribbons and other things that you can't really use the roll-on tape for. A much better alternative then elmer's or tacky glue."
5,The best comic strip since Calvin & Hobbes . . . hands down!,"Without a doubt Mutts (and Mutts II) is the best comic in the papers now . . . and these books are a must own. The humor is original and fresh; if you look close enuff, between the dialogue and the artwork, there's usually a few subtle chuckles to be discovered besides the punchline. Mooch & Earl are my heros . . . almost wish I were a dog or cat!!!"
1,"wow, this book sucked.",this was the worst comic strip ive ever read!!! it was so terrible i couldnt even get throught the first five pages!!!!!!! if you have any sense at all you wont buy this book.
3,"History of the Sessions Family in America; The decendants of Alexander Sessions of Andover, Mass. 1669","I dont really recommend it unless you are doing genealogy on the Sessions family. It was alright but It wasnt the right people for me. I also have a complaint about Amazon.com you have a business that you get coupons from that is some how hooked up with you site. They had my debit card number and every thing. They also had two months worth of charges on my account for $19.95 a month. So if anyone gets the samething call your bank or your credit card company. Oh, and I wont be ordering from you because you dont have paypal."
3,Functional and Child Friendly,"This versatile camcorder uses the Hi-8 tapes which is backwardlycompatible and makes most sense for routine use (baseball outingscamping etc). The large LCD screen and the rechargable lithiumbatteries with audio are its major plusses. It has no firewirecapability and hence cannot be sent out for rapid display outside.Overall, a sturdy, compact product from Sharp."
4,Excellent value,"I'm pleased with the camcorder so far. For the price, it has some nice features. The 3.5"" LCD is nice and provides an excellent picture. The camera is easy to use and the menus are fairly intuitive. The one complaint I have so far is that there is not a dedicated button/switch for the digital image stabilization. You must navigate through the on-screen menus to find the DIS and toggle it on/off. This is inconvenient and cumbersome while recording. So much so that I think I'll probably never use it. But for what I plan to use the camera for, it works great and is a very good value."
2,Not only the Wizard,This movie shows Frank Morgan in away you have never seen him performFrank Morgan in my opinion is one of the greatest story tellers inHollywood and we would be the poorer if he had not been there
3,Read the book,"This was an okay movie. I wouldn't rate it as ""excellent"" because the book was better. The book touches on some key points that are not reflected in the movie which decreases the impact(my opinion). For a truly good movie check out Fireproof. That movie hit the key points that this one left out it seems."
5,Kickin in the Sandbx Kuwait,"Not Easily Broken is a must see that didn't get the critic that was due in the theater. All starred cast give a powerful performance of LIFE and it many struggles that come along, giving you the high and lows... a movie that you will watch time and time again... when in doubt on your life, marriage try to look within yourself and go back to the simple things.."
2,"An okay movie, but not my favorite","I bought this movie based on the reviews and the low purchase price. It was an okay movie, but not one that I would watch again. The acting was fine, but I think the script needed a little work. From the reviews, I thought it would be a little more inspiring. You get to see all the trouble in their lives and then suddenly at the end, everything is fine and dandy. I would have liked to see the couple work through their issues. An adult and child are woven into this couple's lives and the story line... but their story line upstages the main characters for a good portion of the movie."
5,not easily broken,I really enjoyed this movie. I watch it quite a bit. the actors were so good and good message. I was like to have more of these kinds of movies
1,Thumbs Down,"Thumbs down on this one. 95% of the movie focuses on a variety of problems in a variety of people, with the main focus on one couple. Only 5% of the time is spent on the solution to this couple's problem, while leaving the other problems unsolved. The solution to the couple's problem, ""having God as the third strand of your marriage"", is not explained. The movie drags, has lots of swearing, and would not be helpful to a struggling marriage."
4,Really Liked This Film,"I loved this movie and was surprised I did. The only thing I didn't like was the swearing. I really didn't feel it was necessary. However, I love Bill Duke. He is an awesome director. Morris Chestnut I have loved forever. He is such a believable and incredible actor. Taraji, was introduced to her with ""The Family That Preys,"" and have loved her ever since. Great story, wonderful actors, and a keeper of a movie."
2,Poor job,"It is a poor script despite a star studded cast. In many ways this movie failed to deliver for me because all the problems seem to be rooted in immaturity of the wife and the script fails to give any clue to the reason, was it upbringing? Was it simply ill conceived pygamalion kind of thoughts?"
4,McGee and Meyer tour pre-Cancun Mexico,"A classic commentary on the 60s counterculture by John McD. A group of flower children are scattered across Mexico and have information concerning Bix Bowie's last days. As Meyer and McGee unravel the story, the gang starts dropping like flies. Several neat twists and a jawdropping finale. Reading this book brought back memories of old Dragnet and Adam-12 shows featuring the degenerate hippies. Trav gets more work in the bedroom than in any other I've read. Along the way he gets to pummel a homosexual AND a lesbian(not that there's anything OK with that, they just had it comin' to them)."
5,Great Book,"I thought that this was a great book. Once I had time to read it, the pages flew by. The first pages catch your attention and keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. I loved the romance intertwined with the mystery and religious themes throughout this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good storyline with well developed characters."
5,3 good stories for the price of 1!,"I've never been too thrilled about contemporary fiction, but this book kept my interest throughout the book. The uniqueness of this book is having 3 stories that all connect in a smooth transition. The consistency of the main characters and the realistic settings of each story suspended my usual skepticism towards fiction.In terms of the book's Christian aspect, as a fellow believer, I thought the book had realistic portrayals of how Christians struggle with their faith in a God who allows painful ordeals in life, but who remains faithful and true to those who persevere and maintain their belief."
2,Too much weak jazzy rhythm,"The first cut on the album sets a bad tone. Once I start hearing that lame rhythm, I'm done. More a matter of not liking the Bernie Pearl Blues Band I suppose, and perhaps me being more of a Delta Blues fan. I can't stand that west coast sound. May as well be Kenny G!"
1,BUYERS BEWARE!,"My daughter wanted this soooo bad, so I finally gave in for Christmas. It arrived today and I am so disappointed! First of all, the box does not have the castle top like the pictures show. Second, the clothes are really tiny and flimsy...very bad quality. I just opened the box and some of the tops are already coming apart at their seams and around the edges. Third, the description should tell you that you don't get all the different skirts really; each skirt is half one color on the front, and half one color on the back...rip off! Lastly, for this cardboard trunk of junk, it was way too overpriced! Now I'm going to have to spend even more money buying her something better to make up for this tacky gift."
2,Don't waste your money,"The main reason this item recieved any stars from me is that my girls love to dress up, so I cannot deny that it has a fun factor and that there is educational value since it gives a huge boost to the imagination. However, I have two girls both of whom are average height--my oldest at 9 has outgrown this since she was 3, but still LOVES to dress up. My youngest at 6 has grown out of this as well at age 3. It is just not worth the money for the little time that they can use it. The quality is also horrible. The outfits do not stay together, the shoes break and the jewelry does as well. My recommendation is to go to a local consignment shop or clearance sales and buy some ""fancy"" dresses, buy some cheap jewels at the dollar stores and create your own princess box. My girls have gotten many more YEARS of use from the items I have purchased this way. Happy dress up Hunting!"
2,Too Small,"This would be great for small girls, however I got this for my daughter who is almost four and the clothes barley fit her. If your child is over 3 1/2 years old I would not recommend this."
2,not as advertised,"I ordered two for birthday presents. I got plain boxes that are already falling apart....no castle, no castle-like attachment, nothing that resembles the photos posted with this product. Bummer, I could have bought the same clothes for much less, but thought the idea of a castle as packaging was great! I guess some things you just should go to the store for."
4,Dress up fun,My daughter loves the high heeled shoes. The outfits require some adult assistance to put and are fairly durable. The earrings and trunk are not so durable. The set as a whole has been a lot of fun for her and less expensive than disney outfits.
1,Don't waste your money,"My kids were so excited to have this this toy, but it was a huge disappointment. After about 2 hours the clothing was already starting to rip along the seams. By the second day even more clothing was ripped and glitter was peeling off the microphone in large chunks. We have had it three days now and I have resewn along the seams of all the clothes. The fabric is also very cheap and began to unravel on the pieces that were coming apart. As other reviewers stated it seems sized much too small maybe would fit 2 year olds best. I could write even more reasons why you shouldn't buy this but I think I've said enough. I would not recommend this to anyone. My advice would be to buy ""dress-up"" clothes, at Goodwill or garage sales to find more durable, quality clothing your kids can dress up in."
2,On Children & Death book review,I found that this book wasn't as helpful as I needed. I was taking a psychology course dealing with how to incorporate death education into an elementary school setting and this basically just gave stories about people/children dealing with death and ways to incorporate all family members. A much better book is Helping Childrne Live with Death and Loss by Dinah Seibert. It gives a way to create lesson plans/field trips/discussions about death with children while also including the stages of grief.
2,Bad Bottles,Personally I thought these bottles were very cute and they also had a good purpose of keeping air out of baby's tummy. Well they didn't work for my son. He had the worst time with gas and spitting up when I used these. I had been using the avent bottles but the sound of the air entering into the bottle was just disturbing! My baby choked on these nipples and they would collapse leaving me with a screaming child. I now use the Dr. Browns wide neck bottles and would highly recommend them to anybody. For one thing they don't leak like these do!! The only reason I gave these bottles two stars is because they are so easy to clean and they have the cutest shape to them...
3,Daughter loves bottles...mom did too..until now....,"These bottles were working really well for us. They did leak a little but not so much to be messy. My problem is the bottom seal...I have lost some and one got run down the garbage disposal. I can't find any of these in individual packages like the nipples. If the seal is ruined, the bottle is useless. :O("
1,Molded Disk :(,"I loved the playtex VentAire Natural shape bottle. I bought them instead of the Playtex drop-in kind for money reasons. I have had these bottles for 5 months and they keep getting MOLD in the tiny holes in the bottom disk. I have boiled them and put them in the dishwasher. I ALWAYS let them completly dry before I reassemble them. I called Playtex and they said they were sorry and would only send more disk after I sent them all of mine?? What was I to do for a bottle?? This was their defect, not mine! I just wanted them to at least give me some sort of credit toward the Playtex drop-in kind as that was the only nipple my son would take and they said ""SORRY"". Now I have to buy more bottles for 5 more months!Don't make the same mistake I did!"
3,Bubbles,"I am using formula with these bottles and I have one major issue with them, bubbles. I have never had a problem with leaking and I don't mind the assembling, but aren't these supposed to be bubble-free? There are still tons of bubbles when feeding my daughter. I also have the regular kind of VentAire bottles and those have no bubbles at all. So I prefer those over these for formula feeding."
1,LEAKY DISKS TIMELY to replace,"The disks, required by this system to vent air through the bottom, wear out rather quickly. These disks are NOT sold in stores, or online. The consumer must contact Playtex by the 800 number, wait for them to e-mail, mail, or fax a request form to you. You must then complete the form, requesting replacement parts, send the form plus a certified check to Playtex and wait 4-6 WEEKS for the replacements. Out of the 12 bottles I purchased, after 4 months of NOT constant use (I breast fed for 6 weeks), I'm down to 6 functional disks."
3,These bottles are GREAT! BUT...,"With the exception of one (fixable) issue, I love these bottles. My baby doesn't have as many gas/spit up issues with these, and the nipples don't leak, as some others do (quite annoyingly, I might add). Like some others have noted, at first nothing would come through the nipples. I sterilized a safety pin, by boiling it, and carefully poked it through the hole of the nipple. voila! No more problem!"
5,Great for the breastfed baby,I love these bottles. My breastfed baby goes back and forth between the breast and the bottle so easily with these. They are super easy to clean because they come completely apart (the bottom comes off) and they don't leak. The shape is great for holding and the colors are nice and generic.Highly recommended!
2,Awkward and leaky,"We are loyal to the Soothie line of bottles and so forth, they have always worked well for us. I tried these hoping that it would help my baby sleep better with less gas but there were several problems right away. She didn't seem to like the shape, and it was kind of awkward for her. It was really hard to get the top just so, so it wouldn't leak. And the bottle will not fit in most warmers. I wouldn't choose this one again."
3,Not good to warm breast milk in.,"I like these bottles, so does my baby. They're easy to clean, nice to look at and relatively sturdy. BUT, I regularly pump my breast milk and put a stash away in the freezer. These bottles leaked when I immersed them in hot water - and the water wasn't even THAT hot. I thought at first that I hadn't resealed them properly but I had, and I tried again on the other bottles. Same thing.For moms who are planning to warm their precious and much hard-earned breast milk in these bottles, don't. Warm them in a different bottle instead. I've resorted to warming my milk in an Avent bottle (my daughter hates their nipples for some reason), then pour it into the Playtex ones after."
5,The best bottle around,"My daughter had a very bad problem with gas , and after going through about a dozen diffrent bottles we tried the VentAire ones. They were the best thing ever. She stopped spitting up and we never had to use the gas drops again. And another great thing is that if the disk in the bottom gets torn or worn out you can call playtex and they will sand you new ones (up to 6) at no cost and an order form if you need more. If we have another child we will use these right from the start."
5,Perfect Bottles!,"Out of all the bottles that we have tried, these are the ones that we are going to stick to! We previously used the regular ventaire bottles, and they worked just as good, but we switched to these because my baby is still breastfeeding and the shape of these nipples were perfect! The bottles are small but chunky enough to hold and cleaning them is easier than cleaning the Dr Brown bottles (which didn't work for us). The colors are pleasant to the eye, but best of all--they really work!! My baby doesn't have cramps and doesn't spit up at all anymore! I love these bottles so much, they are worth the money you pay for them!"
2,nipple doesn't fit snug around ring,I recently bought these bottles after using the disposable Playtex bottles. I have had a significant amount of leaking around the nipple of 2 of the bottles and around the bottom of 1 bottle. I called Playtex and they are going to send me replacement vouchers to give these bottles another try!
4,Love it!,"I am a breastfeeding mommy, and I bought this system to supplement pumped milk. I love it! It really does the trick. The nipples are the perfect shape. I bought the 9oz. so my baby could use them as his appetite increases. I accidentally bought the wrong nipples, so make sure you buy slow nipples for a newborn, but it is wonderful. It really cuts down on his gas. I just wish I had bought more."
2,They leak,"I had problems with these bottles leaking on both ends. My baby hated the larger nipple, and half the milk always came out all over him. They also leaked from the bottom."
1,Disappointing,"Don't waste your money on these. I had been using the playtex premium nursers with the ""NaturaLatch"" nipples, but buying the liners proofed to be a pain. These bottles use the same nipples and are not supposed to let air in the milk, but that proved not to be tru. First, the nipples are harder than the ones for the disposable system and tired my daughter out sooner. Second, the only way to relieve the vacuum in the bottle is to partially pull the nipple out of her mouth and let the air in through the nipple. This ""Vent"" system is definitely not working; at least not for us. We are back to disposables until we find a suitable bottle for her. On the up side, the removable bottom does allow for very easy clean-up and the wide bottleneck is great for preparing the bottle without spills."
4,super buenas,"excelentes para que los niños no sufran de cólicos, yo las uso siempre, y además son bonitas, lo único malo es que no puedo elegir los colores."
1,Stick w/the Original Ventaire!,"My baby hated these bottles. We have the original Ventaire bottles and she loves those, so we thought we would give these at try. My daughter could not latch on to the nipple, and wound up with half the formula on her bib. The bottles also have a tendency to leak unless they are put together absolutely perfectly. They were not as reliable as the original in keeping air out of the bottle."
4,"Great bottles, but difficult to unscrew tops","I really like the wide mouth of the bottle and the fact that they come apart and are dishwasher safe. My only complaint is that when I need to take the top ring off to warm or wash a bottle, I have such a difficult time loosening it. There are no grips on the top ring (like the drop-in bottles) so they are hard to grab and I believe that as the air goes out the bottom vent, it creates a sort of vacuum that really seals the top ring. If playtex put grips on the tops, they would be a five star bottle."
4,Nipples stop working,"We liked these bottles right from the start. The work well with keeping air out and our baby girl really seems to like them. The only trouble we seem to have is that the nipples stop working. We have been using the bottles for the last 5 weeks and put them in the dishwasher to clean (they are diswasher safe). I am not sure if it is the dishwasher that is doing it, but so far 5 nipples over the last 2 weeks have just stopped working. When I turn them upside down, no milk comes out. I called playtex and they said we were doing nothing wrong, and did not know why they stopped working. They sent me coupons for new nipples, but it is still a real pain to have to replace them."
1,Horrible Bottles,I thought these bottles would be good to help my baby reduce her gas and throwing up..wrong! This makes my baby have worse gas. Also the bottles leak randomly and goes everywhere and makes a mess. Also my baby does not like the nipples they are too big.
2,"bulky, leaky, not for me","We switched from Avent to these bottles, and I'm not impressed. The leaked often & their unusual shape didn't fit our sterilizer. I returned them for a full refund - it just didn't work for me."
2,Don't waste your money!,"After a few months, these bottles start to leak like crazy. The little plastic piece in the bottom must be perfectly lined up, and even if it is, the bottles STILL LEAK. Unless you want milk all over you, your baby, and your furniture, buy bottles that DON'T OPEN AT THE BOTTOM! Waste of money!"
2,nipples closed!,My daughter couldn't get aything out of two of the three nipples! So I have to use the same nipple for all the bottles!
1,worst bottle ever!,"I am a huge fan of the VentAire bottle, but for some reason, the Natural Shape design leaks. Even when we are careful about how we assemble the bottle, it invariably leaks creating a huge mess! We have about 9 of these bottles and every one, a leaky mess. Sometimes a slow leak, sometimes a fast leak- 95% of the time some kind of leak! If you like the VentAire, stick to the regular shape!"
3,Needs Medium Flow Nipples,"These work great for ""bubble free"" feeding. We started out using the Evenflo Comfi bottles. The nipple would collapse and my son got VERY bad gas bubbles in his belly. We would have to burp him every couple minutes. We switched to these and they work great. My only complaint is now that he is 3 months old, the slow flow nipples seem to be too slow for him-he is taking over 45 minutes to eat now and gets frustrated because not enough milk is coming out. I tried to switch him to the fast flow and they are too fast, he chokes or winds up spilling half the milk out the sides of his mouth because too much milk comes out at once. They need to have medium flow nipples for this in between stage or make their slow flow just a little faster. I'm thinking of switching to another type of bottle but fear a gassy baby but I don't know what else to do since there isn't a nipple for this bottle with the right flow for him!!"
1,Mind your fingers!!!!!!,"Hi all,I wouldn't rate a product so low in the face of 139 great reviews. But this is when things go very wrong :(. I bought a 3-pack of this product and while trying to hand-wash them , cut my finger . Calling customer service was worse!!! Ask for the supervisor and she didn't even cut it for a rep!!!! She forced me to choose between coupons and a refund only after returning the bottles, not fair!!!! Somewhere on amazon, I read evenflo customer service was so nice, replacing bottles and everything...I would strongly recommend checking the bottles before washing or using them..horrible molding!!!! Avent ones are so smooth to handle...not a rough spot..What's wrong with Energizer Customer Care???!!!!"
2,Just Ok,"Not the best bottle. Looks Cool and you think its going to be neat with the ""vent air"" system when in reality it doesn't make much difference. I purchased these bottles and after my ds hit the 2 month mark ~ he started to get frustrated with the slow milkflow. BOTH THE STAGE 1 AND STAGE 2 NIPPLES FOR THE BOTTLE ONLY HAVE ONE HOLE! I ended up trying the ADVENT bottles which happen to have 4 nipple flow rates - all with more than 1 hole. My son finishes a bottle within 5 minutes compared to 20 minutes and is much happier! PLEASE RETHINK INVESTING IN THESE BOTTLES. THE good reviews I understand ~ they are nice to clean because they come apart but also while using them I ended up losing some of the vent discs and riping one ~ YOUR GOING TO BE BETTER OFF AND HAVE A HAPPIER BABY IF THEY CAN DRINK THEIR BOTTLE AND SATISY THEIR HUNGER BEFORE FALLING TO SLEEP ~ TRUST ME!"
1,I do NOT like these bottles!,"I had bought these bottles becuase of the look and they seemed to be a good bottle. But I was wrong! I like the bottle itself but the assembley of the bottle is not good! After you take them apart and clean them after each use and you put the plastic cover back on the bottom of the bottle. It always leaks! There has been numerous times wich myself or my husband thought we got the covers on good and have put them in his diaper bag, and to our not happy surprise we notice later on that they leaked out water or formula everywhere! And this goes for when you are pouring formula into the bottle on the counter! I wish I had used a diffrent bottle! They make a MESS!!"
3,These are ok.,"I'll start with something good. The shape helps my daughter keep the milk coming. As in, even if she's not holding it perfectly (she's only 4 months), the angle still allows for formula to flow. Very advantagous when you need a minute to do something with the other hand while she's eating. They also have a nice wide opening. That helps with scooping formula into the bottle, rather than around it.On the other hand, there are too many parts. A simple one piece bottle is much easier and faster to clean and dry than the extra pieces found in these. And, no they don't do much about swallowing air. Who said it was bad for babies to swallow air anways?And last, but most importantly, I've found nothing that says these are BP-A free, so as soon as I get my new bottles, these are getting trashed."
1,too much work,"No less air. Just keep any nipple full of fluid and your ok. Put the bottle togeather just right or you will be cleaning up a mess. Too many pieces to put togeather, I have enough to do."
2,Can't use electric bottle warmer,"These bottles were a gift at our baby shower. I am glad I didn't spend the money on them because the instructions warn not to use them in an electric bottle warmer. We all know you aren't supposed to microwave bottles either, so you are left with the only other option, placing the bottle in boiling water to warm. That works fine except when you tip the bottle up to feed the baby, the boiling hot water that has been trapped in the vent holes drips down your hand/arm, and potentially onto the baby! Now I have to remember every time to make sure I get a towel and shake the bottle a little to make sure all the vent holes are emptied out before feeding our baby. USE CAUTION"
2,PLEASE READ -DISAPPOINTING BOTTLES!,"I like the angled shape idea of the bottle and the colors, that's it! If your child is drinking just 4 oz, the stage 1 nipple is appropriate. However, when your baby is drinking more than 4 oz you need to throw these bottles away. When you switch nipples to a stage 2, the milk flow is extremly fast because the opening is so---- large they choke and get gass! They don't sell medium flow nipples, it's either slow or fast. So, you end up like me and spend more money and time buying different bottles, ones that your child can grow with. Plus, when you use a warmer with these the humidity/condensation build up from it's vent system on the bottom is EXTREMLY HOT! I already had some drip on my daughter's leg that almost burned her, which other bottles don't do. I love the Dr. Brown's bottles, and are very happy with them."
2,A major pain!,These were SUCH a pain to clean and use - my kitchen looked like a science lab. I threw them all out.
2,Found unscrewing the bottom a pain,"My mother purchased these bottles for me for my 1 week old son, and I have already moved on to a different bottle. The size is fine, and I like that it's wider and not as tall, but the whole deal with unscrewing the bottom to make the formula come out was just too much hassle. What's worse is that I didn't realize I had to do that at first, and my poor baby was sucking on the bottle forever and not getting anything out! Once I realized that I had to unscrew the bottom to make the vaccuum work, I had to tighten the bottom to set it down and then try and loosen it again with one hand while feeding. Once I turned the bottle too loose, and formula came out way too fast and my son almost choked. Not the worst bottles, but not my personal favorite."
3,"Great bottle, but still too much air","As much as I would have liked these bottles to work, they didn't. We had latching on problems and wanted a wide nipple to keep the wide mouth. We tired many bottles and the smaller ventaire worked best. Be prepared to try different things out and do what works best for you and your baby."
3,Need better description of product,"I could not see the actual bottles in the photos, so I did not know that the bottles had special features at the bottom. I may have bought another product instead if I had known."
5,great bottles,these bottles are really good. the bottle is nicely shaped for good flow to the nipple and into the baby's mouth with out much air. which means less spit ups
2,"Okay at first, then clogged","These were great at first, we loved the size and ""tilt"" feature. However, we stopped using them because nipples would clog. We also use some formula that might be clog-prone, but we didn't have this problem with our other brand of bottles."
2,Nipples,I like the bottles but the nipples are not good for a newborn. It would take my daughter over an hour to eat with the stage 1 nipples and the stage 2 nipples were so fast that she couldn't keep up. I am sure the stage 2 nipples will be fine in a couple of months but there needs to be something between the Stage 1 and Stage 2 nipples.
2,There are better out there!,"I bought these bottles for my newborn son because they are supposed to reduce air which in turn would reduce gas in his poor little tummy! Well these bottles made the gas even worse! He also has acid reflux and these bottles did nothing to help that!Also the stage 1 nipples that came with the bottle-- half of them did not even have a hole in them. Yes I did boil them and all pieces before the first use as well! The stage 2 nipples were just way to fast for a newborn!We junked these expensive bottles and went with Plytex disposables with the NaturaLatch nipple! Absolutely no problems and no gas! Very happy with the transition!As we all know a happy baby makes a happy parent!! :)Buying disposables can be a pain, but I would definitely go that route over these bottles anyday!"
3,Beware! These bottles leak,"Great bottles, but they leak. And you have to get the rubber ""gasket"" in just right to make sure that the bottom doesn't leak. Also, there are many little parts to wash. Good side is, they do decrease the amount of air that enters your little one's stomach. And the nipples are great. It will not cause nipple confusion if you're breast feeding. The ergonomic shape is great."
5,Best bottles I've tried!,"I have a 4 yr old and a 1 month old and I used Avent bottles with my 4 yr old. But they always leaked when he would suckle his formula he'd squirt formula by the corner of his mouth. But they were so popular that I stuck with them. Now with my newborn, I bought Avents and had the same problem and decided to try out the Playtex AirVents (wide ones) and they are heaven sent! No milk squirting from his mouth while he suckles and dont have to pause the bottle to let the air build up out. He just suckles and suckles non stop till he's done with his bottle. It's great! Oh! And with Avents, my newborn would also choke when he'd be drinking and with Playtex AirVents that problem ended! These are the bottles Im stinking to."
3,Okay but could improve,"These bottle work great once you make sure that all of the little fiddlely bits are opened and installed properly. One of the biggest problems that I had in the beginning was the nipples resealing after sterilzation as well as the bottom diaphram-like pieces. Those bottom pieces can really reek havoc if all of the little holes are not twisted open to allow air to move in and out of it. Also, after a while those bottom pieces tend to get a little hard and stained, and Playtex doesn't sell replacements, so you have to buy a whole new bottle, unlike the nipples. You also have to make sure that the nipple that you put on the VentAire is actually just that, or the bottle will not work (ie. baby won't be getting any milk)."
1,"LEAKS and DOESN""T HELP w/ SPIT-UP, SAVE YOUR MONEY","I bought these bottles for my baby who is a big spitter. They haven't helped at all, and one of them leaks like crazy all over the place. I will be calling Playtex to request a refund."
1,These crack and leak EASILY!!!,"Please don't waste your time and money on these bottles. They leak and don't withstand washings in the dishwasher. After only a couple of months they were all cracked and useless! They also leak from the vent sometimes, and are annoying to assemble. Too many little parts!!!"
2,My son cant get anything from this bottle!,"I bought one of these bottles because i likes the idea of being more like the breast, and i wanted to breast feed. I couldnt breastfeed but my son only really likes ""dome"" type nipples. I tried giving him this bottle and he couldnt get anything out of it! He was just sucking air. I looked at the ammount in the bottle after a few minutes and he hadnt gotten anything. I tried twisting the top of the nipple to ""open"" the hole and tried again. he still had the same problem! I use the normal ventaire ones and he love them and has no problem!"
4,good bottles,"I think this is my baby's favorite bottle nipple shape.Like many others, I was worried these bottles would leak but they don't! Hurray!I really wanted to try these to see if they'd cut down on burping. They don't appear to do so, at least not significantly, but my baby is not exclusively bottle-fed.Pros:- They don't leak!- They are super-easy to get very clean (quickly!) because the bottom comes off. This is great when I'm out and about without my bottle brush.- The shape of the bottle is easy for me to hold and for the baby too although the 9 oz size is very unwieldy for young babies.- DISHWASHER SAFE!Cons:- Water will get into the bottom cap if you warm your bottles in water (but once you realize that it's easy to shake it out).- Can't tell if the bottle cuts down on burping and gas.- I wish this set came with an extra vent disk and nipple like the multi-size set."
5,VERY SATISFIED,"I love them! Being a first time mom and tring new things out, We had gone through several bottles and no luck. It was always the case of my daughter sucking in too much air. Then by chance we tried them and have been using them since. We started out when she was about 6wks old and she had no problem going from from breastfeeding to bottle. She was less gassy and did not spit up as soon as she was done from all the air that was sucked in while feeding. Then recently we had started using the Natural Shape bottles and she is able to hold those a lot better as well as drink from the nipple. The only down fall about the bottles are tring to locate replacment vent dics. Since my daughter had started eating cereal in her bottle the cereal settles along the the bottom of the vent disc and in the small vent holes. Even after daily cleaning and rinsing after use they still have a hard time coming clean. But overall they are the best bottles my daughter has used an reasonable priced as well."
2,Need medium flow nipples,We like the style of the bottle and the ventair system. Unfortunately the stage 1 nipple is way too slow and the stage 2 is too fast. With the stage 1 my son (who is only 3 weeks old) gets frustrated and with the stage 2 he spills a lot of the milk over his mouth. We have found other Gerber nipples that fit in the bottles that work much better.
5,"Used the newborn starter, now using this!","We used the Starter set in the beginning to bottle feed our baby. He's now 6-months old and drinks more than 6 oz at a time, we use upgraded our bottles to these 9 oz bottles. Same great quality as the starter set. I like how's it's BPA free, leak-proof, and easy to clean. I also like how the bottle is curved so my baby can kind of hold the bottle on his own. He's barely starting to hold his own bottle, and the curve really helps. Anyways, great brand."
4,Loved it,"Mom loved these but with other more high-tech bottles, it takes a while to get into ""the zone."" The right nipple, the right angle and right delivery all play into the success of the bottle. Following the directions is important and it takes a little practice. She said it was a little frustrating at first but once both mom and baby got it figured out, feedings went well."
4,Love that it's BPA Free,Ordered these bottles and am very happy with my purchase. They ar BPA Free and today that is a biggie. Will definately buy again.
3,Okay bottles,"I liked the bottles for travel because the nipple fit the same as drop-ins, which were my main bottles, but some of these bottles leaked. I don't know why, only one leaked, and the other two didn't. I liked the bottles but was just annoyed by the leaking one."
4,Works GREAT for bubbles!!,I use these bottles and avent bottles (i have an avent pump)and noticed that with the avent bottles my milk had a horrible amount of bubbles. These ones have NO BUBBLES! which means its probably better feeling for baby! The size one flow is perfect for my son. He burps as soon as you sit him up (this might just be because he is a fast burper? every baby is different) and he has spit up only twice. (He is one week old)The only problem I have is that I cannot find an adapter that will fit my avent pump and fit these bottles to pump directly into them which makes the avent bottles a little more convenient with breastmilk and playtex doesnt make a hand pump.When I decide to stop pumping I'll definitely give him these bottles exclusively.
2,Not So Great!!!,"I purchased these bottles because my baby has problems with gas. I thought this would reduce the intake of air. Not so much. In order for the formula to keep flowing you must screw the bottom off the bottle several times. This can lead to a big mess if your baby moves or turns and the bottle tips. Also it leaks out the top and bottom. The nipples that come with the bottle are not soft and too firm. You can purchase softer ones to fit this bottle, but it's a waist on the original ones. I do like the wider mouth idea. It made it easier for my baby to latch on (with the soft nipples extra $) and it is a larger area to get the formula in. I would recommend the new Gerber bottles. They have the wide mouth, less leaks, and less air."
5,Even Hubby can assemble!,"Now that I have your attention, I like these bottles a whole bunch. I have used Avent (review) Dr. Brown's (review not yet written) and these. These are awesome! Just unscrew and clean all parts (which is not require lots of time, patience, and tools)! Even your husband can figure it out! Now that is easy if a man can figure out the fine art of bottle assembly and dissasembly. The wider bottle is easier for an adult to hold but seems heavier if your baby tries to. Overall, 5 stars"
2,thumbs down,"they were fine at first, slightly annoying with several parts to clean without having a dishwasher. but after about a month the numbers began to rub off and they started leaking everywhere. i literally had to use a measuring cup to pour the correct amount of water in to make formula. very annoying."
3,So-so,"Just a warning:These slow flow bottles make feeding last extremely long, and, despite their design, I can't tell a significant difference in my infant's gas from when I use ""regular"" bottles.These bottles also leak, even after you have twisted them on tightly."
3,Don't expect a miracle,"All of the bottles out there have slightly different features. What distinguishes these is that they are supposed to prevent gas and colic. We used many types of bottles with our first baby and he did have some colic problems, so we decided only to use Playtex VentAire with our second baby. While these may be doing something, the results are not miraculous as gas/colic is an issue we still experience.We never experienced leaking with these bottles and do not think there are any disadvantages that these bottles have to others out there. The shape of the bottle is a little different too, but that really didn't make it any easier or more difficult in any way for us, so that was more of a style difference than anything else. We have tried both the wide bottles and the smaller kind, and they both work the same."
4,Good,This Playtex 3 pack BPA Free VentAire 9 Ounce Wide Bottles are for my grandson and according to my daughter are perfect for him.
5,Love it!,"Just came in today and I love them! Easy to clean, not near the gulping he had on other bottles, easy to hold, the nipples are very soft and he downed his milk in record time! The only problem we had wasa that he has been on a standard bottle and not used to the wide so he kept going back to just sucking on the nipple part, but I can see that in time, he will get the idea and like I said, there was no gulping or sucking in air even with the sucking on the nipple that way as with other bottles. Well worth the price I paid."
4,"Excellent product, but value is better in Playtex starter kit","This is an excellent product that works as advertised. The bottles don't leak, they're easy to clean, and the nipple is much better than most other baby bottles. They also have a nice shape and they look pretty nice too.My one major complaint is about the way the product comes packaged. It does not include extra nipples. Basically this product gives you three 9 ounce bottles for about $12 (current price). For only $20, you can get thePlaytex VentAire ADVANCED BPA Free Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set, which includes FIVE bottles, several extra nipples of different sizes, extra bottle caps, and extra vent disks. The newborn starter kit is a much better value. On the other hand, if you just want a few bottles plain and simple, this is definitely the product to buy. Very pleased."
2,stay away....,"I bought five sets of both 6oz and 9oz bottle, because I thought the ventaire is good for my baby per the product description. The 6oz bottle has slow flow nipple and the 9oz bottle has fast flow nipple. I use these bottles from the time my baby around half a month to two months and since then these bottles are in a shelve. The slow flow bottle takes up to 1 and half hour to feed 3oz. My baby suck on it the whole time, but since it is too slow it can takes a long time. The fast flow is too fast, which can choke up the baby since she couldn't swallow fast enough. My baby spits out half of her feed with the fast flow bottle. Stay away from this kind of bottle if you can or just buy one set to test it out first. I have been back to the standard yellow nipple which is much better."
5,Just what my baby needed,"My baby has had problem with gas since one month old. She constantly was breaking seal and thus swallowing air, and when she was about 3 months old daycare reported her large mouth was causing her to not even be able to seal properly on the standard size bottle nipples. These bottles work great for her! She can seal properly on the wide nipples, and the ventaire bottles keeps her from having to break seal as often. The result since we've been using these is MUCH LESS gas problems in my beautiful baby."
4,good nipple,"This is the only nipple my daughter would take after leaving the hospital. Its an easy bottle to clean, however you must never forget to insert the little disk into the bottom of the bottle. Its very frustrating to have formula leak out onto the countertops at 3 am when your half asleep and the baby is hungy!!! lol"
2,Two major problems -- numbers rub off & seals leak,"These bottles have two key defects...1.) The numbers wore off of these bottles within the first two weeks! Each day I had to rewrite the oz. markers back on the bottles with a Sharpie...a total pain! The only reason I continued to put up with this is because my son took to these bottles so well.2.) The bottom seals/vents leak. I found if you put them in the microsteam bags, they warp easily and then the bottle will leak. I had to buy all new vents. I simply washed these in hot soapy water and no longer microsteamed them. That did the trick.These two performance issues drop my overall rating. All that said, my son took to these bottles extremely well. If you really want to go with this brand, get the Crystal Clear version. I had no trouble with the numbers on the Crystal Clear ones."
3,"Yeah, it leaks if you don't do it just so - but not THAT hard......","I purchased these and used them for my son for approximately 6 mo. (had nursed until he was 6 mo. and stopped bottle feeding @ 12 mo.). I now have twin boys and have used the SAME bottles & SAME nipples & SAME bottom suction thing and the only leaks I have is when I don't put the bottom suction on it correctly. Granted, it does take a bit of looking but quite honestly, it's not THAT hard. The only reason I don't give it 4 or 5 stars is the price and the fact that the nipples have 2 flow stages and the fast flow still doesn't seem fast enough for older or more aggresive sucking babies (my boys are now 6 mo. old). These are a great shape too for when baby holds their own bottles.We had tried Avent & Playtex Nurser (with the liners) and though the boys didn't like the Avent, the Playtex nurser worked well BUT what a pain to use the liners (even the drop-ins, IMHO). Take it for what it's worth........"
3,Stage ones two slow for my newborn,"I bought these bottles and loved the shape. My newborn daughter sucked too hard for these stage one nipples. It took her 45 minutes to eat 2 ounces. As a result, she sucked in a lot of air and had gas pains. She was not burping during or afer feeding anymore.The stageb twos were too fast for her. I switched to Dr. Brown's stage ones and couldn't be happier!"
4,Playtex VentAire = Happier Baby,"We've tried just about every baby bottle out there. The Playtex Ventaire significantly reduces the amount of air our son takes in when feeding. I give the bottles 4 stars instead of 5 because each bottle consists of 5 pieces. As such, thoroughly hand washing the bottles after each use can be time intensive. I have not had a problem with the bottles leaking. I did receive a few which had the outer lettering rub off but Playtex replaced them."
5,Great Bottles,"All our prior bottles resulted in collapsed nipples or constantly having to remove the bottle from our daughter's mouth to let the removed air back in. With these bottles, she just feeds. Now that she's older (6 months), she seems to really enjoy the wide-mouth bottles as well. She spills far less and noodles with the nipple less.Notwithstanding these virtues, I haven't noticed that she burps or spits up any less with these bottles."
1,Unnecessary,"I was trying to get a Playtex bottle/nurser that didn't require liners, since the liners seemed like another unnecessary expense, but my baby liked the Playtex natural rubber nipple. However, I found these bottles confusing and the added features completely useless. They require a silicon nipple, and my baby couldn't get a good suck on it. It might be good for other babies, but not mine. I'm going to keep them around and try it out on her again, but I don't have high hopes for this bottle."
4,works great,"I have to say I was leary about trying this type bottle after trying the original ventaire, but this bottle has been working great. I'm not sure if they improved their nipples (previous nipples didn't work), or if because it's a stage 2 nipple the milk flows better. Either way it's working fine. I still like the fact the bottle opens at the bottom, making it easy to clean. I've never had a problem putting it together, or milk leaking from the bottom. It's true what the other review said about if you heat it up in a bowl of water that will leak from the bottom."
2,Not loving these bottles,"My babies found these bottes to be extremely difficult to get anything from. In fact, after trying to feed them for almost a 1/2 hour they had gotten nothing. I can't even draw air through the nipples.....way to difficult for a newborn. Maybe there is an issue with the set I have but I don't like these."
2,It's not as I expected/.,"I order this harmonica because it is a famous German brand. When I got it I found it's made in China, same low quality as my other harmonica I purchased in China."
5,A Treasure,"This has always been my favorite children's book. Its simple message about being true to yourself is timeless. The black and white drawings allow for the imagination to color them in. My copy is 40+ years old but I just bought the anniversary edition in the box cover for a baby shower. Pretty! Wish mine had a cover so it held up better over time. Thank you, I'm going to go sit under a tree now - maybe I'll read a book, maybe I'll smell the flowers. :)"
5,Great Choral Music,I had heard a selection from the album on my local PBS radio station and thought it was good.the album net my expectations
2,Poor renditions of good songs,"The CD contains many fine old songs and could be a treat to hear if the arrangements and renditions of the songs were not so poor. The heavy emphasis on the treble (soprano) voices (at normal volume on my sound system) resulted in ear piercing sounds that took the joy out of listening. Not all of the songs are treated so badly that they are not reasonably pleasant to hear, but I was unable to play the CD through: after I had had enough of jumping up and down in attempts to attenuate the accented (and somewhat non-melodic) treble voices, I simply put the CD away, never to be played again."
1,A lackluster atempt at the majors,"Ok.. The boxed looked cool enough and the plot seemed like it could be genually frightening, but i was wrong. The ""film"" was a contrite boring mess. It looks as if it was crafted by people who obviously have no concept of dramatic structure. I am usually quite forgiving of independent horror films but this one should have stayed in the garage."
3,Goes for atmosphere instead of gore and succeeds nicely!,"Independent horror film goes for atmosphere instead of gore and occasionally succeeds quite nicely. The setting is a trailer park, where the residents, particularly Richards, are haunted by a creature that invades their dreams and steals their souls."
3,Professionalism lacking in many projects of its ilk.,"Demonstrates a commendable amount of imagination for a movie of its nature...[director Bookwalter] demonstrates a facility with camerawork and editing that gives the movie an air of professionalism lacking in many projects of its ilk...the tall, cloaked [Stan] Fitzgerald cuts an imposing figure as The Sandman. Evidently aiming to create an unpretentious, old-fashioned creature feature, Bookwalter has by and large succeeded!"
1,beware,beware this pressing of bortkievitch as the finale was left out.The performance was cut already but it did have a finale!
4,"Good Music, Really","I think it is worth saying that the Busoni Indian Fantasy is a good piece of music. And that allowing for the fact that Busoni was not remotely as great a composer as Bartok, that the use of themes bears some comparison for ingenuity and respect. Also this performance is quite good, expansive and detailed. It seems to de-emphasize the virtuoso aspect, and hit the musical point right on. But clearly the skill of the performers is very apparent as well."
3,good smooth soul,"This album contains the mega hit ""I don't have the heart""(also sung by Stacy Lattisaw). Already this song makes it all worth. The other songs are smooth good soul songs sung with James Ingram's very silky voice. A steady soul album."
3,Not James' best but has its bright spots.,"""One Day At A Time"", ""I Don't Have The Heart"", ""When Was The Last Time Music Made You Cry?"" and the ultra-smooth ""Baby Be Mine"" are great songs that do as wonderful a vocalist as James Ingram justice. The hip-hop/house-flavored tracks at the CD's beginning were (on the other hand) as tasteless and lacklustre as can be. While this CD has its moments of glory it's definitely inferior to James' 1983-issued debut ""It's Your Night""."
3,"I prefer ""It's Real Soft""","The CD has two parts. The first part, called ""It's Real Hard"", contains five danceful tracks and the sixth track ""Baby be mine"", one of the best song of this album. ""Baby be mine"" brings to the second part of the CD, called ""It's Real Soft"", five wonderful ballads with James truly at his best."
3,Just use vinegar,"I've used both vinegar and this cleaner. Vinegar worked just as well, and I prefer the smell of the vinegar to the chemical smell of this product."
3,Did it work?,"Have two Venta humidifiers/air-cleaners and live in Nevada, so we use them constantly. Water here has very high TDS, so salt build-up in the container and on the drum is an issue. After using the cleaner, it was very hard to tell whether material had been removed from the drum plates.It was not clear that cleaning impacted performance at all."
4,Good Book for Attack Bonus and Campaigns,"I bought this book along with the Ensemble Studio book. This book has a few tables that list the actual number of Attack Bonus of the unique units (like cataphract +8 vs infantry) that I can't find elsewhere unless you actually play the game (it becomes handy). Also the chapters on Campaigns are very very good (to me, better than the ES book on this aspect). I actually won a few campaigns using the guidance of this book that I can't win before. If you are starting as a single player and want to win the campaigns, I recommend this book. But if you want to be a good multiplayer gamer, this book offers no help at all and get the ES book instead (see my other review)."
2,Meanders Too Randomly through History,"This book was assigned for my church history class at Princeton Theological Seminary. It looks promising at the outset because of the large number of scholars who have contributed to the book. It incorporates scholars from different cultures and institutions to attempt to bring together an ecumenical view of Church History. Unfortunately that goal is never achieved. The book wanders aimlessly through church history, never clearly identifying what time period they're trying to cover and making much of what they're trying to present incoherent. This is mostly likely the result of so many different voices trying to get a say. There are better church history overviews, such as Justo Gonzalez's two volume ""Story of Christianity."" There are some good sections here and there, such as the section on Islam, but this is a book better left on the shelf."
2,Very weak.,"Prince released this as a favor to his friend George Clinton, on his Paisley Park subsidiary, distributed by Warner Bros. But the truth is that if he hadn't done George that favor--and in terms of Clinton's reputation this did no one any favors--this wouldn't have been released at all. Weak sauce all around.There are a few modest high points here, but only a few, and this is one of the weakest albums in the George Clinton discography. Pretty much only for completists."
2,Two Songs almost stand out here.,"By far, the serious jam on this CD was ""Tweakin'"". That was the one jam I was into. But with this and ""The Cinderalla Theory"",(which is not the same as the Pinnochio Theory) paying anything over $10 for it is a rip off. Sorry, the Doctor of Funk does not prescribe this one as a whole, just a little ""Tweakin'""."
1,Too much tweakin'-- not enough funk,"I may change my mind later but a few after a few listens i don't like this album. I love Parliament-Funkadelic and a lot of other P-Funk spinoffs but somehow this is hollow and none of the P-Funk magic. Thankfully it was second hand. When I compare this to the best of the P-Funk stuff done with Bill Laswell, this is very weak."
3,alright clinton puts out another slept on classic,"this cd is clinton's comeback only problem is he had prince giving the orders so this joint is'nt as funky as his previous efforts still contains the sillyness george has been known for and not his worst I suggest dope dogs, and the awesome power of a fully operational mothership for some of the p-funk we come to know and love."
3,battle athletes victory:experience university sattalite,"this video is the beggining of Arkari Knozakis toughest fight ever.She now has to deal with her new team:a strange girl from the moon(chris) who has a serios crush on akari and her very own cow,and a whiny,weak girl(anna) who wishes to be just like her.Poor Akari! even with all of annas crystal ball and toilet paper readings,they just cant seem to win a single match,and to make it worse,thier trainer,mr miracle,absolutely refuses to train them untill he sees their ""full potential"" this particular battle athletes video isnt exactly serious,and it has lesbian suggestions,but it is very funny and i reccomend it to someone who isnt looking for something that will make them cry or think alot."
4,Ewan Maccoll - The Essentials,"Having heard Ewan MacdColl's music in various venues; Radio, CDs, and music festival. And knowing his connection to the early Folk Music scene in England, Scotland, and Ireland, I felt compelled to purchase and listen to the CD and was not disappointed. Many of the songs are familiar to the American audience by artists well known to us, ie - First Ever I Saw Your Face - Roberta Flack, The Shoals Of Herring - The Clancy and Tommy Makem, and Manchester Rambler - The Dubliners. All performed in Ewan's inimitable folk style. A definite plus for the collectors of Irish Folk Music."
3,ciara just came out the closet,okay song the beats alright but she's just giving us subliminal messages about her downlow lifestyle.
1,Mismatched Reviews,"The reviews are for the Indian movie Taal (fantastic music by A. R. Rahman, buy the DVD with English subtitles). The ""Taal-Vidya"" title here does not appear to have any rationship whatsoever to the movie or its music, so the reviews are not applicable."
2,Worked for a year then died.... Customer service is HORRIBLE,"Monitor was fine... a few quirky things i didnt like. Slow response, colors were off compared to my TV and CRT despite my best adjustments. I always inadvertently hit the reset buttom when powering off... which meant all my settings were lost.After a year of service it died... pretty sorry life. The customer service is SLOWWWWW sat on hold for 20 minutes to get a service tech. The music on the customer service was loud and aggressive classical (which fueled my anger at the wait time... what idiots). Needless to say... id buy a no name monitor from other big e-retailers before id buy another mag LCD. Dont waste your time or money unless you feel like buying a new lcd down the road."
1,DO yourself a favor,"Before you consider a MAG monitor, go online and read what has happened to lots of MAG owners including me. Just after 1 year of service my 19"" MAG lcd died. It would work for 15 minutes and then the screen would go black. Turn it off and on and it would work for 5 minutes and then go black until it would not come on at all. MAG customer service is non-existant. Before you buy read some reviews and buy from a better company. MAg lcds are not worth the money."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I bought this monitor a year ago this month at the Black Friday sale at Best Buy thinking I was getting a deal but it is NOT at any price. I wouldn't take this monitor again if Best Buy was giving them away. Every day when I turn on my computer, this monitor blinks vertical stripes over and over again and I have to restart the CPU about 5 to 6 times in order to get it to work. I have emailed and called Customer Support and no response to my issue. I was told by them that my problem may be RAM related as I did add a 1 Gig stick of RAM to my CPU recently but have removed it and still got the same annoying issue of blinking lines and a high pitch whining sound. I gave this item one star b/c it did work but only for one year. My advice is spend your money on a more quality item that will last longer."
2,Not so good,It was ok - but I don't really feel like I got the sense of where he was trying to go. He needs to mature a little as a writer.
5,"""....simple elegance at its finest. "" ~JC Angelcraft",When I received my Cartier Men's Midsize Must 21 Watch #10072R6 last Christmas I must admit that I was a bit surprised. It has since become my favorite watch. What I like most about this Cartier Men's Midsize 21 is that it is not ostentatious and can wear it anywhere. The watch also rests gently on the wrist and is not overly cumbersome like some other luxury watches. It is simple elegance at its finest. ~JC Angelcraft
4,Buy this cd,Helen 55 is one of the better new bands. I saw them at a show with Papa Roach and they were awesome. This is one of the better albumns i've heard lately and recommend it to everyone.
4,Great value,I purchased a bunch of these for our children's choir to use at church. They have held up wonderfully and the kids just love using them. The product is built very well and is of surprisingly good quality considering how inexpensive these are. Go for it - you won't be sorry!
5,A must read,"Wasn't sure if this book was for me, but I am so happy to have read it. It is beautifully and intelligently written. Cullen Thomas' account of his years spent in a Korean prison is powerful and introspective. He writes in a way to make you feel that you know and understand him and each of the characters. Leaves the reader knowing that there is lessons and hope in each bad situation. It would make a great movie. Read it, you will be glad that you did!"
1,Bloated,Another successful attempt at crowding five pounds of material into a ten pound bag. Entire chapters can be skipped without losing the story thread.
5,Great Read,They sure knew how to write books back then. None of the filth and dirty words these authors use today. Just good old-fashioned common sense and wholesome storytelling.A+++++
3,do not over tighten,"1st pair sent back the lens was knocked loose in shipment or was cross threaded at company. 2nd pair lens were loose I had to tightened item when received and the treads are made of plastic which subjects it to cross threading when tightened, do not over tighten."
2,Built like a tank but....optics poor.,I bought theses binoculars as work equipment. Their construction is tough as nails but they suffer greatly from internal reflections. Not recomended for low light or night use! (no 30mm objective will perform well in dim light) Best description would be STEINER LITE. Not up to the standards of the rest of the Steiner line.
2,Stiener Binoculars 8 X 30 Marine,"I was very disapppointed by the poor quality optics of these binoculars. Steiner has a supberb reputation but eidently they are producing a low quality product at this level to get to a low price point. Typically steiner sells at twice this price so the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" is true in this case. The optics on the Bushnell or Nikkon at half the price are as good or better. Don't be fooled by the Steiner name on this model."
5,AMAZING!!!,"Unbelievable quality, day and at dusk. Bought these for my husband for Christmas, and he couldn't be happier! :) Great product, worth every penny!"
3,Not what I'd hoped,"I liked some aspects of this game. I liked the graphics and the details - like the fact that you can buy tatoos and hair styles. There was also the fact that your actions affect how people react to you that made the game more interesting. Beyond that, I felt the game was too linear. You follow a story line and there is virtually no room to explore or interact with the world on your own. It reminded me too much of final fantasy, where there is a path to follow and its always the same. I found the game repetative and uninspiring. I was very disappointed. Everyone I talked to LOVED this game, and the review were fantastic. I'm glad I didn't pay full price."
1,Stop reviewing games you haven't even tried yet,"When people start reviewing games the first day that you can pre-order, it sorta destroys the purpose of a star rating system. Many people use the star rating system to help choose the games that are right for them and to see if users enjoyed the game being viewed. If you rate and write reviews of games based off screen-shots and trailers, you are doing a disservice to those looking to see if they want to buy. Visually ""Fable"" looks like it is shaping up to be great with in-depth gameplay, but wait until it is released to put your two cents in so others may see if it is truly a great game on the basis of true playability, not marketing ploys. I am placing a 1 out of 5 rating in hopes to counteract the flood of 5 out of 5 reviews."
5,Good escapism,"Excellent game, lived up to the hype. Might be a little short, but there is some replayability there if you want to try it opposite of the first go 'round (evil vs good or vice versa). I'd buy it again."
4,"Good, but get the Lost Chapters edition.","While this game is great in it's own right, if you can get a copy of Fable: Lost Chapters, you should get that one instead. It's the same game, but with more content and costs about the same."
2,Going to skip this one,"This is one RPG on the Xbox that I'll either be skipping totally or maybe renting. The graphics, from what I've seen so far (pics and video's) are remeniscent of a Gamecube game. I'm not a fan of the Gcube, and from all the preview images out there it looks like I won't be a fan of this game.Granted there may be some great innovations in this game, but if I can't get past the cartoony graphics then it's not worth my money."
5,This looks sweet,I am so looking forward to fable and I cant wait for it to come out it looks so cool. I was wondering if you could make female charactors because I havent seen any. If someone knows the answer please write it in your review I beg you please please please
5,Fable Rocks,Fable is the BEST game I've ever played. I like how you can do ANYTHING you want like being good or evil.
4,I'm excited for it.,"Fable sounds like it will have a developed interaction sytem more creative but similar in design to KOTOR, being that I really liked that game, albeit it was somewhat simple, it was fun, I can't wait to see fable, Graphics should never be the firstmost important thing on our minds for games, it should be gameplay and story. That's what this game is hoping to deliver."
1,Feeling Stupid,What I purchased was not the game at all!!! It was a Bonus CD that had a demo game on it. I guess I really need to read the fine print from now on. I ended up with a pretty case and not the game I wanted at all. Probably won't ever do this again.
1,Sucks,this game bit the graphics were great and all but the game was really short and easy i am an okay gamer and i beat this game in 2 days.It is kinda fun how like GTA u can run up 2 people and slash them then let the guards go after u.Over all i would'nt buy this if your a huge rpg fan then just rent it at blockbuster
5,Best RPG,"Along with the two Halo games, Fable is one of Xbox's best games. The gameplay and story are addictive and fun. The game is full of humor and a lot of action. Since I didn't have high expectations for this game, when I played it I was simply shocked by how good it actually was. Since I bought it to play on my Xbox 360 the game was very cheap by then so not only did I buy one of the best game ever, but I got it for a mere $10."
3,Amazon sucks,"What do I think of this game? I don't know since Amazon hasn't shipped it to me yet. What's the point of pre-ordering a game if it doesn't get shipped when it is released? Forget Amazon, I cancelled my order and I won't pre-order anything from these guys again."
1,I agree with debee,"Dont write reviews when you haven't played the game. There is no point. All you do is mess up the star rating system. I like to know what people THINK about games they've bought, I can GUESS about them without any help. You go do that stuff somewhere where Money isn't involved. The 1-star is to counter all the fake 5's"
5,Fun!,"This is an rpg. You do anything. If you are good you will have an angelic glow and you will be admired by everyone but if you are evil you will have devil horns and people will flee from you. You have weapons and magic and you can get tattoos, haircuts, clothes, armor etc. You can buy estates for your guy and even get married and have kids. A torture chamber awaits simple morons and you can use it! This will be great!"
1,No fun if you can't play it!,"Why did I preorder this game? I thought, incorrectly that it would ship when it was released. Silly me it still has not been shipped. Guess they already have my money so why hurry? I wont ever shop here again unless some sort of fair recompense is made. Its 9/20 and amazon says it has shipped but according to UPS it still has not shipped just more lying they do respond quickly to my email the only problem is the are not telling the truth!"
5,Wonderful transfer to DVD!!,"I have been watching this film on video & laserdisc for the last dozen, or so, years. Never have I seen such a fine print! The beautiful technicolors come shining through. The reds, blues, & yellows are all brilliant & vibrant. As for the story, it is a wonderful telling of a union army raid deep into the south, that's based on a true Civil War incident. There is real chemistry between Wayne & Holden. And John Ford's masterful directing skills are evident throughout. Great job MGM on this DVD!"
4,weak blueray transfer,"one of my favorite john wayne movies.the whole cast was good.i never realized that the movie was cut short due to an unfortunate filming accident.john ford did a great job of ending it without completing the full shoot.great directing job.regarding the blueray transfer.very disappointing. this blueray transfer was one of the weaker efforts that i have purchased.the film quality was no better than a dvd film you may find in a bargain bin.not sure why but have seen much better transfers for films from the same era.check out the blueray zulu.{michael caine,stanley baker et al}blueray was breathtaking.anyone know what studio did the horse soldiers transfer.i would like to avoid purchasing their products in the future.i will keep the horse soldiers blueray but may buy it again if a better blueray version becomes avalable.classic movie though."
4,The Horse Soldiers-Blu-Ray,"This is the type of movie, Hollywood should make more of instead of the ridiculous garbage they now turn out. Holden. Wayne are actors. The blu-ray version in spots is a little grainy but it's a great DVD to own"
1,Great Movie,Horrible video quality. Don't buy this it is the worst video quality I have ever seen. It looks like a 1930s early black and white picture with snow everywhere. Complete crap. I have the dvd and it is so much clearer. If John Wayne had seen this he would have beat the .....Out of the seller for ripping him off !!!
5,A classic,"This is a movie for John Wayne fans. While not his most famous role, it captures the essence of what makes John Wayne an American hero."
4,Great old-fashioned actioner,"John Wayne on horseback. The Civil War. A daring raid. William Holden as a whiskey-swilling surgeon. What else do you need?This story, based very loosely on a historical incident, follows The Duke as he leads his cavalry unit on a long raid through Confederate territory, causing as much mayhem as possible. And with John Wayne in the saddle, that's a lot.I first saw this movie in the theater, when I was a kid. I loved its action and grand sweep. Many (too many) years later, watching it again on DVD I still enjoyed its action and sweep.Some things you just never outgrow."
2,Horse Soldiers - great movie - bad DVD,"The Quality of the DVD was disappointing - I have a VHS tape of the Horse Soldiers that is better quality than the Blu Ray DVD I got. I will not buy anymore Blu Ray DVD's of movies made before 1970 - the quality of the cameras they used prior to that makes creating a 1080i Blu Ray DVD difficulty if not impossible. I was going to order ""The Quiet Man"" in Blu Ray when it became available in Jan but now I am going to pass"
3,Not What I Had Hoped For,"Over the years I believe I've seen all the significant films of John Wayne and John Ford, except ""The Horse Soldiers."" Tonight I finally viewed it on the DVD release and have to admit it was a let-down. Oh, I enjoyed it but it did not live-up to the reputation of these many years. Much of the problem with placing this films highly among others with Wayne/Ford is in the screenplay which struck me as too scattered and without real focus. The Duke did his usual thing well but I believe John Ford was not at his best in this particular effort. A few classic western scenes are included but it lacks the style of so many other Ford movies that are recognized by his fans. Worth seeing but not twice."
5,John Wayne,I am slowly transfering my movie collection from DVD to bluray. Some older movies do not gain from the transfer but this one is a good transfer and it is a great movie.
3,Second-Tier Ford,"Despite the solid John Wayne-William Holden pairing and William H. Clothier's impressive camerawork, the mastery of John Ford lacks focus in ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959). Uneven and overlong, Ford's only Civil War drama boasts moments of sublime visual poetry weighed down by a rambling, dialogue-heavy screenplay. Wayne and Holden pick up some of the slack, with good character vignettes from Bing Russell, Carleton Young and Hoot Gibson. The Newton Station battle remains a highlight. No match for the director's masterpieces, but superior to most of his 1960s output."
4,The Horse Soldiers,"This has always been one of my favourite John Wayne films. Once again blu ray has lifted the final film into a new dimension even though there are occasional lapses. The picture clarity almost jumps off the screen at you. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the sound quality. Unlike The Comancheros, there is no 5.1 mix thus the film is not quite so involving. The lack of extras is also a disappointment. I feel it is better not to rush these opportunities out without giving a little more thought to what might be included to enhance the background of any film."
4,The Horse Soldiers,"This is a Hollywood version of real events that took place during the Vicksburg Campaign in 1863. While there is a lot of Hollywood flair, the events of the raid and the impact on the fall of Vicksburg are well documented. All in all it is quite enjoyable and great for a rainy afternoon."
3,Good movie..HORRIBLE blu-ray transfer,Who is responsible for this mess?? I have standard dvd's looking better than this..Amazon should have some sort of disclaimer about the poor quality of transfer............This movie deserves better!
4,Great Wayne war film,"Typical Wayne movie, with a great case, great locations and famous attention to detail - characters are true to life."
3,Not as good as their other albums...,"I gave this 3 stars because I still like the album...but I won't be buying it anytime soon. Their other albums are a million times better as far as I am concerned. If you don't have Drunken Lullabies or Swagger, I suggest you buy those albums first. Both are 5 stars, or damn near it enough above 4 that they deserve the 5. Flogging Molly is an incredible band, that's a lot better than Dropkick Murphy's. This album just isn't their best work, although it's still better than many punk albums. Not sure if this is even punk though...I know their other albums are sort of a celt punk...but not too sure about what to call this one. Still an okay album, especially to put into your computer playlist if you have the other Flogging Molly albums, but get their other ones first, and maybe after you get those, another will come out even better, or you'll hear this one, and you'll like it enough to get it."
2,what's the big deal?,"I thought I'd love this album since I like a lot of music and everyone raves about Flogging Molly, but really I found it pretty lacking in appeal. I didn't care for the singer too much and the vibes just weren't my style apparently. I'd recommend the Dropkick Murphys a lot more than this band."
5,Don't jump to conclusions,"I got this CD as soon as possible, and started listening to it. Needless to say I was disappointed. It seemed like Flogging Molly had lost it. But I listened to it more and more, and now I can say every song on here is great except for the awful Factory Girls and Tobacco Island(which according to Dave King is about Oliver Cromwell but I don't see it). But regardless this is an amazing CD on par with Swagger and Drunken Lullabies. Any claims saying they have gotten ""softer"" are entirely false. I attended a concert last night and the new songs got the exact same reactions as the old ones. This is a must buy for any Flogging Molly fan, and you really have to listen to it before passing judgement. Some of the songs will turn you off at first but just give them a few playings and you won't stop listening to them."
3,"Good, if you're a fan of this type of music","The Pogues did it first, and did it best. Since then a thousand bastard sons of the Pogues have been cranking out punk tinged music that has seemed to find a niche. In my opinion this band is one of the best of it's kind. Not as ""oi!"" as Dropkick and more musically talented than The Real McKenzies.The best thing about this band is they can really play their instruments.I was playing in a sessiun in Tallahassee and Flogging Molly came walking in after a gig they had in a pub across the street. They sat in with us and played jigs and reels until the Pub owner threw us out at 3 in the morning. Flogging Molly were all very nice, gracious, funny, and talented. They should incorporate more trad tunes to their stuff."
3,More of the Same,"I am a pretty big flogging molly fan, but his recording didn't really do it for me. They don't break any new ground, and none of the songs are as catchy as those on Drunken Lullabies or Swagger. For new fans, this may satisfy, but when you purchase any of their other cds you will probably like those better. I think this band has a lot of potential, and a very original sound. They spent a lot of time on this record, but I feel like they are maybe running out of interesting material.This record is solid, but the band really doesn't exceed the quality of their first two albums here, nor do they expand their sound or try anything new.If you like this band, I suggest you buy their first two cds first. Other bands to check out if like Celtic rock music are the Dropkick Murphys, who are maybe more punk, and Wuthering Heights, an incredible Progressive Metal band with Celtic folk music integrated seamlessly."
5,fantastic album,"Not much needs to be said:Dave King and company know what works for them, and they continue to do it in this album. Dave, while sporting a little more pudge (and in fact, lately he looks like a young version of Colonel Sanders) still wails, keens, pleas, and shouts as well as ever.It's hard to call some tracks ""favorites"" because I like them all, but ""whistles the wind"" and ""Seven Deadly Sins"" do seem to stick in my head.If you like the Pogues, Dropkick Murphys, or any other Flogging Molly, you will like ""Within a Mile of Home"""
5,I may never buy another Flogging Molly CD.,"Because this one is just too good, and I doubt that it will be possible for them to make anything better, so why bother. Better than Swagger, better than Drunken Lullabies, and that is saying a HELL of a lot, because these are 2 of my favorite CDs I own. Upbeat from start to finnish, with a few slower, but not slow songs mixed in. If you are a fan of Flogging Molly or the Dropkick Murphys, not only will you not be dissapointed, but this disc will never leave your player."
3,a wee bit disappointed...,"The new disk is good, I'm not disputing that, but it isn't great. It just feels like they sat down to fill a quota, the formula of punk/folk irish music. ""must have one sad type ballad, one ballad that ends well, one comedic song, one raging pissed adventure,...."" And then played them over and over again in a studio until something of life was just sucked out of the songs and a little extra special polish was put on them.It lacks the flash and energy of some their other stuff, particularly Drunken Lullabyes. It feels toned down and overly ""glossy""."
4,Joe shines on this platinum seller.,"Joe Cocker's first studio release of the 90's proves to be an enjoyable listen. ""Night Calls"" sold over 2 million copies in Germany alone upon it's release. The cd opens with the Bryan Adams tune ""Feels Like Forever"" which is a fantastic ballad that would have been a monster hit if radio stations in the U.S would have given it some airtime? It's so true that Joe can make a song his own. The majority of his covers usually outshine the originals. Wait till you hear his takes on ""Can't Find My Way Home"" and ""Love Is Alive"". They blow the original versions away by Steve Winwood and Gary Wright. The title track has a little ELO overtone thanks to a great production job by Jeff Lynne. Joe also lends his vocal chords to a fantastic gospel feel remake of the Beatles ""You've Got To Hide Your Love Away"" complete with a church like chorus. Joe is like fine wine that keeps getting better with age. The most disticntive growl in rock n roll never sounded better."
3,Night Calls,"I'm a big Joe Cocker fan.This album is his first in the 90's.This version of the album where released in USA in 1992, but the orginal version where released in europe 1991.The album is not one of his best.I like him better on albums like ""Cocker"" (1986), ""Have a little faith"" (1994) and on his new release ""Respect yourself"" (2002).My favorite songs on this album is ""Love is alive"", a real rocker, and ""Night calls"".I like the powerballad ""You've got to hide you're love away"" too.I saw him live in Oslo Spektrum in january 1992 on his ""Night calls world tour, and he rocked the house down.If you're not a Cocker-fan, buy the best of-album ""Greatest Hits"" (1998)."
3,It's plastic!,"I thought this product was metal. The description didn't indicate that it was plastic. I guess I'm stuck with it for now. If someone wants to break this bad enough, plastic will be a lot easier than metal."
4,Good reference for valuating companies using financial statements,"I used this book in two ""Business Analysis using Financial Statements"" financial accounting classes and found it to be useful the few times I needed to use it as a reference.The text represents what I think is a fair mix of both accounting (the reading and interpretation of financial statements) and finance (the valuation) perspectives. It contains more or less what I would have expected from a book with ""A Valuation Approach"" in the title: multiples, various valuation models (DCF, APV, etc), etc. But it's technically an accounting book in my mind, so it also contains examples for all of the major topics that it covers using 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and other SEC statements as examples."
5,Solid Album!,"This was the first album that I heard from Michael Cooper back in 1989, and I've been a fan of his ever since. Lots of great songs! I still listen to it today, so it was worth going to Buffalo, NY to buy it back in '89. It was a really rare album to find back when it was released. ""Over & Over"" is my strong favourite from back in 1989 and still is. If you like late '80s R&B, you will definitely enjoy the stylings of Michael Cooper."
4,Does what it sets out to do,"This is a nicely accessible introduction to one of the most inaccessible philosophers. The author manages to convey the flavor of Spinoza's thought just enough to tempt the appetite for more--which is, I think, exactly what one wants from a book of this sort."
4,Worth the 90 minutes,"I plan to start some of Spinoza's works soon, so I read a few short introductions in preparation. This one has the hard task of trying to introduce Spinoza in less than 90 pages, of course this means that much has to be left out. Overall this was well written and easy to read, it focuses much on Spinoza's life and the environment which he wrote his works in. The coverage of his works is brief as expected, but decent and this was well worth the short time it took to get through."
4,Quick Review of History's greatest,"I picked up ""Aquinas in 90 Minutes"" in our Maui condo laundry room. It was so interesting that I now have St. Thomas Aquinas "" Shorter Summa"". I then had to have the same "" 90 Minute"" book for other ""favorite philosophers""."
2,Disappointing,"As an english-speaking die hard fan of ""Latin"" music, I got this CD because it was the only collection I could find that had the Celia Cruz track ""La Guagua"" on it--an amazing, brilliant, ebulent celebration that I heard one time and knew I would love forever and had to have! the rest of this CD is unlistenable for me, which is not to say others may not love it. I love Oscar D'Leon's voice and spirit, but tend not to like the songs he sings. When I saw that he was on this collection with Tito Puente, I thought how could this be a bad thing? Fake out! it's the very boring ""Hay que trabajar,"" an effort I consider beneath both those great artists and was shocked to find out was them. Since, as noted, it was the only collection I could find with La Guagua on it, I was going to buy it. The rest of the compliation was a disappointment for me and I don't recomend it."
2,Wish it worked well,"I tried two of these. The first one would pixalate the picture and the sound would drop out. Also there was a green flashing tint when I tryed to capture from my other 8mm camcorder to convert the tape to digital. Amazon was very good about getting me a second camera in short order. Unfortunantly, it had a loud tape drive motor that the mic would pick up while recording so you always had a buzzing whine in the background. I liked the camera and wished it had worked well. Still pictures were very weak but it was cool to have that ability at all. Don't give up your dedicated digital still camera. Light sensitivity is a couple of years behind. Good light, good picture- poor light, well, you get the picture.Can't beat the price but I think I will wait to see what else comes along. As I said, if it had just worked properly I would have been satisfied for the price."
2,Playback quality was totally unacceptable.,"I opened the package and tested the Viewcam with a brand new tape in a fairly clean room. Played back image was terribly distorted with several horizontal mozaic-patterned bars. During further recording, ""head dirty"" warning sign occasionally came up. Cleaned the head with a brand new cleaning tape, without any improvement. I returned the Viewcam and bought a SONY TRV-18, which, to my surprise, played back the very movie without any problem. This means, in my case, the Viewcam recorded the image successfully but could not show its achievement on its own monitor.Still pictures were OK though. Sensitivity is lot better than my FinePix 4800 and the image quality was better than TRV-18."
3,Love the Video hate the pictures,It is a great camera for video even though when I zoom from far distances it is fuzzy. The pictures suck!!!! You will never get a really clear shot unless you are outside. There is no flash... You can lighten the picture but it is not them same. Then getting the pictures developed... Well they look pretty bad. I love to scrap and can't do it with these pictures.
2,Firewire Non-Support,"I just got off the phone with Sharp myself to see if the prior rating was valid or not. He sure was. In effect, they are not going to guarantee that you can even transfer your video to your PC. The Firewire might work, it might not...they won't be responsible if it doesn't. The tech told me that my best bet would be to buy a 3rd party software which could get the job done....only it wouldn't be transferred digitally. What a crock!"
4,worked out well but BEWARE!,"i purchased this camera a while ago and received it yesterday. the firewire transfer works!! but beware>>>others are saying it doesnt..so i really cant recommend it. its small and convenient with decent video quality. i use a belkin firewire. if it doesnt work it seems that sharp is kinda saying ""too bad"" and not doing anything..so be careful!"
1,does not last,"I bought this camera after seeing the reviews on amazon.com, in particular that it was durable. I enjoyed doing videos with it. But very soon after the warranty expired, the video stopped working. It still worked as a VCR, but not as a camera. When I sent it for repair at one of the Sharp partners, the bill to repair would have been higher than the cost of the camera!!! So be aware that this is not in fact a durable camera, and Sharp USA did nothing to help the confidence of this ex-customer."
2,"Cool Features, But it Breaks","Although I think some of the unique features that this model has, like the VCR mode, are wonderful, I have had serious problems with it. I had to return it twice in 30 days because two different things had broken on it. The first time, the speaker had been damaged, and the second time it began eating my tapes (it destroyed 3 of them). On the second return, I traded for a different brand and I am now much happier."
1,Good Ideas Bad Execution,"I received this camera as a gift in early November to use for the holidays this year. But after returning twice I decided to go another direction. This camera seems to have a problem with noise (funny lines and shapes) on recordings. I spoke to Sharp the first time this happened, and the service person asked if I was using TDK tapes. I answered yes, and the Sharp service person told me that TDK tapes leave a residue on the heads wich cause major problems for the camera. I was only ever able to get five good minutes of recording on either of the two cameras I had."
2,Defective the day I bought It,"Bought this camera, the reviews had good things to say about it. The very first time I used it, upon playback, the video was very badly pixelated even though it was a new camera and new tape. Not a good start at all. The Photo taking aspect of the camera is decent in good light and useless in medium light. I am now waiting on my replacement tocome to me, hoping that the issues will be gone....not betting on it since my buddy has the same camera with the same problem too right out of the box....hmm?? Maybe pass on this one....."
1,Great paperweight...,"Honestly, if you are buying this item get the extended warranty if available...you could very well need it. I had it for barely a year and it worked great no complaints at all till it just quit working all together. Now it makes a great paperweight. The unit will not power up at all. Bear in mind that my unit has never been mishandled or mistreated. I have also done research on the web and have found similar reviews elsewhere. I am still trying to get Sharp to help me replace or repair it. I'd love to be able to write a retraction in the coming days that Sharp has stepped up and done the right thing. Till then...Stay tuned and best of luck."
1,Breaks after the labor warranty expires!,"This is a good camera when it works. Mine stopped working 98 days after purchasing it (8 days after the labor warranty expired). The parts were paid for, but I still had to pay...labor charges to have it fixed. Customer support was absolutely NO help! This will probably be the last SHARP product that I buy!"
2,Not so good as it appears in the picture,"No place to put the hand on,and the LCD quality is not so good."
4,Good value,"Great value for the price. Very easy to use. Took me some time to hook up with USB of older computer. W2000 will see the usb port very easily. Video pics are fatastic. Only disappoitment is the still pics, good for closeup, bad for bigger scenery. But worth every cent for the price."
1,Draw a picture instead...It will turn out better!!!!,"Can i hear you say ""dog crap""? This camera seemed great from the reviews, and boy did I do my homework on this one. Problem was that intermittently there would be a problem during playback of tapes, ie: extreme digitalization or blocks across the video. It drove me crazy so i sent it back to amazon, who then sent me out another unit. Same issue with this one!!! Called sharp and was told they thought maybe i was using the wrong tapes???? How is that possible, I was using Sony Mini DV's, no mystery there. They told me not to use TDK tapes as they are having issues with this camera, thankfully i did not use TDK. Anyway, after 13 months of this issue, i had enough. Called Sharp corporate and demanded to speak with the CEO. Ended up speaking with one of his people who couldnt have been nicer in fixing the issue. They are sending me a totally different model camera......hope that solves it!!!"
2,Don't Get It,"Well I have to say that Amazon.com was very good about replacing the camcorder. They are now sending me my 3rd sharp VLNZ100U camcorder. Very Nice ppl they are. Now the camera on the other hand well that is another story. It takes good video but it just doesn't want to play it back to the computer. The video comes back all digitized and full of bars. I figured maybe it was because it is going into the computer, so i unplugged the firewire, same thing, just chunked video. I would recommend buying this camera if you JUST want to RECORD. Don't think about playing it back. ROFL a one way camcorder."
2,No Sharp support for firewire,"The firewire connection does not work when connecting to a pc. I have tried on 3 different pc's w/ different cables. When contacting Sharp technical support, they said that they DO NOT support firewire connections to pc.They said the only thing the firewire port was intented for was to connect to another miniDV device. I also ran into problems when trying to get the camera serviced. Would not recommend Sharp as a company to buy from."
5,best saga ever,this is the best out of all the 2 box sets there are because it has the craziest bad guy in it and the best story line. In my opinion goku has to get very strong and save earth but they left out the key tape in this box set and put it in the next box set. What were they smoking when they did that one? this has good episodes and the best story line.
5,Dragonballz is cool.,I wonder how come they do knot show Dragonball GT on CARTOON NETWOKK because I have never seen it or Dragonball and I want to see all of them.I have seen every episode of Dragonballz.
3,Good episodes... bad versions,"This is in my opinion the best saga in all of DBZ. The problem is that these were heavily censored and are only available in dubbed format. In 2003, Pioneer's sublicense runs out for these episodes, and if demand exists, FUNimation has said they will redub the episodes and release them on uncut DVD's with the Japanese audio and English subtitles, similarly to what they are doing with later sagas."
2,PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT DRAGONBALL Z.,"Unless you're looking for exactly what you saw on Cartoon Network, then don't buy this. It's censored just as much, and contains absolutely no extras."
1,Dont Bother,"I saw this first part to the brilliant series on UK tv. I never thought how brutal these people were to it, I read somewhere that they edited so much outof this version they cut out about 20 episodes of footage! Wait for the Uncut Special Editions to all come out, I will!"
5,OMG!!!,"Ok, this is defn. the must-buy box set of anime. You start out with learning about Goku, when his brother Raditz comes along. You then get a good understanding of Goku and Gohan's background. Once you start watching this, you will be hooked. My sister started watching this, and immediately was addicted to DBZ. A great buy for anyone, in my opinion."
1,DO NOT BUY,DragonBall Z was not meant to be watched edited even if unedited costs a little more its worth it. Its been my favorite show since I first saw the show. So i am telling you now its not worth suffering through a horrible edited version.
2,I WARNED YOU !!!!,THIS IS SO BORING !!! ITS ALL CUT!! THE GREAT FIGHTS !! HERE THE EPISODES ARE TOO SHORT DONT BUY THIS ITS EDITED IF YOU WANT IT BUY THE UNCUT VIRSION ITS MUCH BETTER .
4,FIRST SAGA OKAY,THIS WAS PIONEER'S MASTERPIECE I THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY AND NAMEK SAGA IS EVEN BETTER BUY IT IS AWSOME!!!!
4,THE SAIYANS RULE,The reason I gave this 4 stars is because I saw it on cartoon network. I hate commercails.
3,Too long...,"I watched most of the series and the last episode back then... some of the fight scenes are too long, and plain boring. But don't get me wrong, quite hilarious and I laughed all the way through especially when Gohan engaged in a fight scene with Frieza. Gohan and Goku are super saiyans and they have this special power... Man... this is something!!!You gotta see this one!"
2,"The story is bad, repetitive","I watched on Cartoon Network. At first, it is ok. After watching a few weeks, I found that is very boring. They just made the story 'very long' and 'very repetitive'. Goku kept saying he was going to kill Frezier. Then, he got beat up (and perhaps died) after he became a Supersaiyan, later even his son came back to action. The author just made the story super long to make more money selling them. This is just bad"
1,Damn censor !!!!,"The dubbing killed the show ! DB is a real great story in original japanese, but in english the voices are crap, they cut about 75 percent of the battle scenes because they were too ""violent""... I'll never buy that piece of jerk, even if it were only one buck !"
4,Its DBZ forever!,"Well, I must admit that I haven't seen much of this show, but from what I've actuallly sat down to watch, I've liked. I guess it all started when my older brothers watched this show every single day. I would always say it disgusted me to watch 16 year olds and older watcing this kid show, but their boys, go figure. When they made me sit down to watch one episode, I got hooked. Obsessed is more like it. DBZ is the best anime action ever! Everyone of all ages, boy or girl, should watch this. You think its stupid and made for kids but it most definately is not. And now my brothers are rubbing it in my face that I've fallen in love with this show."
5,Quality drama and action,"This is currently what's being shown on Cartoon Network now. It picks up where Dragonball left off, with a reunion of the characters that is interrupted by Raditz, Goku's long lost bro. We learn Goku and Piccolo are aliens, Goku dies in the fight with Raditz, stays dead for 1 year, gets really strong, and comes back to fight Nappa and Vegeta, that's where the action really kicks in. A hint: not everyone lives due to the fact that Goku arrives late. This review is brief, and there's a lot more to it than this. Get this set, or get cable."
5,Dragon Ball Z is a great series!!,This is a great series. Vegeta and Goku ROCK!! Gohan's survival training and the great fight between the Sayans is a must see. Vegeta-Sayan Style is one of the best. :-) Everyone MUST have this box set!! Vegeta Rules!!
1,...Japanese is better!,"Ok ok...the Japanese version is rated pg 13, BUT the english edited it so heavily that it is now rated G! I think if you want to watch REAL DBZ then you should get the Japanese Versions. If you don't understand Japanese then you can get the subtitled ones. Trust me that the Japanese version is so much better! English cuts out everything violent which is the true DBZ. DBZ is supposed to be an action cartoon, not a sissy fight. English DBZ isn't DBZ at all... ~Rachel"
2,Not sure it should be read to kids,"We had to stop reading this to our toddler as he was getting too frightened. Sample text ""What if when I woke up tomorrow morning there was a black hole in the middle of the floor. I didn't want to fall in, so I called you and you didn't answer."" Several ""what if"" situations including the house catching on fire, big spider coming to get him, falling in a hole, you had gone away, etc. It gets pleasant after the first 8 or 9 pages. All children are different, but ours reacted very adversely and we could not finish. I kept asking myself if this was really a children's book (seemed like if this was filmed with a parent reading it to a kid it would make a good Saturday Night Live skit.) The last half gets better, but we aren't able to open the book around our kids at this point."
1,Don't buy this.....if you have an iPod,"Once again, Sony strikes. You can't put this on your iPod. Burt Bacharach: they're really targeting the artists with the criminal element as their fan base."
3,Totally Disappointed with the Copy- Protection Snafu,"I heard this beautiful cd on Yahoo Unlimited Music.It's some of Burt's best work in years. So I paid forthe cd thru Yahoo and downloaded the tracks, only tofind I cannot put them on my mp3 player- the device Ido most of my music listening thru. I guess I can listento it on my computer, but I rarely do that. Burt, tellSony they made a big mistake. Your music is so preciousto be this restricted. Heck, most all of the big illegaldownloading sites are no longer running so what's theproblem?"
1,"What The World Needs Now Is Love, Burt, NOT This Drivel","Good lord, where the hell is Dionne Warwick? Not that it's remotely possible that even she could save the banalities here, a socio-political lyric sheet by Bacharach, the composer, which clearly foreshadows senility. Frightened by the weight of the world, he takes pen to paper for the first time in his career, penning elongated suites, long-winded instrumentals and - gasp - actually singing a few himself. Grabbing onto hipsters and hip-hop is any sage's call for help, but who knew that not even Elvis Costello, Dr. Dre, the most `extraordinary producer of our time' [Burt's word, not mine], or Rufus Wainwright could save this? Good lord, where the hell is Hal David? My grade: C"
1,no rating for it's a big fat goose egg!,"so here's the deal... i buy a ton of music through this site and others. no hyperbole, but i prob. spend close to $500 smackos per month on music. let the record show that i refuse to buy cd's with copyright protection. to hell with the artist and the label. if i'm gonna straight-up buy the cd, then i have the right to do whatever i wish with it. that means being able to rip to iTunes and then put it on my iPod. if i can't do that, then i will buy the cd used thereby disallowing the artist and the label from profiting from me first-hand. the power of the consumer baby! i respect the artist's rights to his work. respect my right to purchase your music and do with it as i see fit. napster, sony, burt, babyface, santana, et. al. be damned!"
4,Works as described,One of the best features is the security monitor. It will automatically take images or video of movement when you're not around.
2,This is NOT a full scale replica.,"This is not a full scale replica. I found out after I received it. It's a 0,33 scale.It was a quite reasonable price, so it's not the end of the world.If I knew this was a .33 scaled model, I would not buy it.I am satisfied with the shipping, and I received it almost 2 weeks before estimated."
4,Great insight into the game!,"Although I play regularly, until reading Dr. Lugo's book, I never realized the many ways to properly play. I assumed that the game was basically luck. Dr. Lugo instructs in the basics then takes the reader into an in depth analysis of the game. Strategy, training and proper playing of tiles are discussed. There are drawings which guide the reader with the strategy being taught. His instructions are well written and easily understood. This is a book which can raise your level of play. It is written for competative partners domino games, but is easily applied to Muggins and other scoring or blocking games. It is not for bidding games such as Texas 42."
4,Great insight into the game!,"Although I play regularly, until reading Dr. Lugo's book, I never realized the many ways to properly play. I assumed that the game was basically luck. Dr. Lugo instructs in the basics then takes the reader into an in depth analysis of the game. Strategy, training and proper playing of tiles are discussed. There are drawings which guide the reader with the strategy being taught. His instructions are well written easily understood. This is a book which can raise your level of play. It is written for competative partners domino games, but is easily applied to Muggins and other scoring or blocking games. It is not for bidding games such as Texas 42."
4,Good Book,There are not very many books on dominoes. I play on the computer daily. I found this book to be helpful.
1,incomplete,"This book does not address ""racehorse"" the game most of us play with double sixes. So useless to many."
1,delusive title,"This book has a delusive title. A more honest title would be ""Puerto RicanBlock Dominoes for Pairs."" If you play Draw Dominoes there's absolutelynothing here for you. Even if you play Block, but not in Puerto Rican styleor in pairs, there's nothing for you here either. If you do play Puerto Rican, go ahead and buy it. But make sure you also buy a crystal ball or apendulum because the author gives rules that assume you know your opponent'shand. You must also be fluent in Spanish to make use of the bibliography theauthor recommends. Go ahead! Have fun!"
2,not pleased,"first of all, my 3 y.o. son does not like to ride this bike for some reason. secondly, it was hard to put together, and the big orange foot rests (is that what it is? - the part the extends from one back wheel to the other back wheel)cracked when we tried to put the screw in. the crack is so big that the screw head goes right through it.since i was in the middle of a move when the bike was delivered, i did not bother making any calls or writing any emails to get the part replaced. i will wind up putting it out at the curb.i would not recommend this bike. the construction is poor."
5,My First Brooklyn Tab CD,"This is my first Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir CD, and I have to say it is absolutely wonderful. I'd say the first half is probably a bit stronger than the latter half of the CD, however, the interpretations this choir puts on some songs is absolutely amazing, and extremely creative. I can see why they are so popular."
4,Satisfied,This one was hard to find. It worked out well. It was received in a timely fashion and in good condition.
5,Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir Hallelujah,A wonderful CD. The music is inspiring. Hallejuah Chorus was raised to new heights. Would strongly recommend it.
5,Unique monsters -fun to draw,"The Deltora series was a great read for my children, 6 and 10. It was fun to draw the monsters with the kids. They're unique monsters and the book fills in what was missing from our imaginations. The monsters were challenging for my 10 year old, quite difficult for my 6 year old. I end up doing most the drawing and they color the pictures. The diagrams are easy enough to follow. We just really loved the series and the drawing book was the ""frosting on the cake""."
5,Creative drawing that's cool!,This book is a great addition to your Deltora library. The illustrations are very cool and spark creativity in those who love to sketch. Simple step by step instructions with a fantasic outcome. You want this one!
5,Excellent,My son is 2 and loves this food. The quality is great and worth every penny. He loves being able to cut the vegetables. Great toy.
5,"love it, big hit","My daughter received this as a gift. She loves the entire set. The quality is great and she can easily cut the onion, carrot, etc. She loves to make soups with the veggies. It's a great addition to her play kitchen."
5,"Fun, fun, fun!","My daughter loves playing with any kitchen-related products. When she was three, we bought these toys for her, along with many other play food items.These toys were and still are her favorite. They have lasted a long time, too!"
5,Consistently Fun,"This was a gift for our 2 year old son and has been a favorite for months. He and his 3 (now 4) year old brother consistently pull this toy out and play chef. Has been very entertaining for the entire family. The set is well-made and has enough pieces to stay interesting. Would be even better with some kind of container to keep the set together, like a play grocery bag!"
5,My daughters favorite,"My 2 year old loves this toy and plays ""soup"" all the time. Veggies are cute, the knife works well, and all the pieces stand up to a ton of daily abuse."
2,Wish I wouldn't have bought it.,"At first, a cute concept... but very flimsy. The velcro doesn't hold on the corn & cabbage. The pea pod is way too hard to open... for a little one. I didn't like the cheapness of the plastic. Overall... wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Save the money and purchase a M&D set."
4,Good toy set for my 2 year old.,"My daughter saw the fruit set at my sister's and loved it. I got her the vegetables instead and she loved that too. She likes to use the knife to cut out pieces and feed my wife and me. And in the process, she has learnt to identify all the vegetables in there. So I will recommend this to anybody, who wants to start a learning process for his/her little one. The pieces are sturdy and while the pieces are held by velcro, the set at my sister's looked pretty used and the pieces still stuck pretty well. So overall, seems a good quality toy set."
2,Better out there,"We have the wooden Melissa and Doug set. They are much better than these and cheaper. For example, look at the carrot. You can only cut it one time. In our wooden set the carrot is four or five pieces. Also, several of the peels and ""throw away"" parts of the vegetables are held on by tiny pieces of flimsy velcro. The husk of the corn and the leafy part of the cauliflower barely stay on after a few months of play. We originally thought that some of the peels and things might make this a neat set, but now it seems like those are the things that we don't like. This feels like a cheap plastic set.We own this set and the betterMelissa and Doug 31 Piece Cutting Food Box. If I were you I would go with the more durable and more fun to cut wood set."
3,Good Toy but its $10 at toys r us,Again great toy but for 10 dollars I'll drive to the store and buy it. Plus the wooden looking cutting board is not included and there are 2 different sets of vegatables so you wont necessarily get the exact ones shown in the picture.
4,Quite engaging,We wanted to buy fruits and vegetables for our 2 yr old. she loves it. It keeps her busy. The velcro adds the fun element. She enjoys cutting the vegetables with knife. Nice product overall.
5,Peel 'N' Play veggies,"I purchased this set of plastic veggies for my 3 year old nephew for Christmas. It was the favorite toy of the day, and all three of my other nephews (ages 3 to 8) crowded around to play. My sister in law was pleased that I choose plastic fruit because she said that with three boys, sometimes toys end up flying through the air. Flying plastic food seems safer than heavier, wooden food. I spoke with her recently and asked her how the Peel 'N' Play veggies were holding up, and she said it was holding up great!"
4,Small World Living Toys Peel 'N' Play,"My daughter-in-law asked for this for my 16-month-old grandson this past Christmas. I was initially reluctant, as the recommended age is 3+. I'm glad I went ahead and bought it, as it was one of his favorite gifts! With help, he can cut the veggies - and he loves to pull the leaves off the cauliflower. I expect it will be played with for many years...."
5,Great Product.,"I little man is 2 years old, and loves taking them apart and putting back together. Great learning for little ones."
2,not impressed,I wish I researched more. I assumed this is a wooden toy. The plastic is not at all flexible and has a cheap feel. The velcro is weak.
5,loved it,"This book is an amazing read. It's not your typical damsel in distress, it has intrigue. I owned this book and read it some much that it literally fell apart. It's definitely a must read."
5,Retractable cable,I bought this as a replacement that was stolen. One thing I noticed was that the old cable had problems with some USB 2.0 devices even though it was advertised as 2.0 compatible. This one just works. No issues. I am happy with it. It replaces a spider web of cables I was carrying around.
2,Defective,"The design is great. Perfect for a laptop case. However, quality control seems poor. I plugged the 5-pin micro USB connector into my Android and it killed it. Had to send the phone back to the factory to get re-programmed. I repeated the experiment with an Android from work, and it caused that one to immediately power off.It seems likely that there's a short in the connector. That's a problem that should be caught at the factory."
3,Emerge Technologies Retractable USB 2.0 Cable with 4 Adapter Tips (ETCABLERU2M),"overall not bad, does its job. not the fastest cable but it does its job. doesnt come with a little pouch or anything to hold the connectors so make sure you dont lose them. very versitile. pretty long for its size. seems pretty sturdy."
2,Great and compact... but,"This is a great thing to keep your cords from getting all tangled up. but you can forget about it if you want to use it to charge the batteries on your devices. I could not charge the battery on my cell phone or camera like I could with the ""normal"" usb cords."
3,Mama and Papa Gappa rescue their baby sun.,"Greedy guy kidnaps a baby Gappa for his amusement park. Naturally his two parents are not happy about this and they rescue him, totally trashing Tokyo in the process. This is alot like Gorgo. I enjoyed this and it has great Special effects. Tape is subtitled and Letterboxed"
1,One of The Most Pathetic Kaiju Flicks,"Have you ever heard of Godzilla? Maybe Gorgo? Well get those not this! A greedy buisnessman sends half-brained twits to clear out and explore an island that he wants to use for an amiusment park. They then meet natives that befrend them. As they head into a cave behind emense statues, an annoying brat tells them not to go in there. The reason is that their gods Gappa would hate that. As stupid as they are, they GO IN! The explorers head into the cave and capture a chicken monster. As they left the island, the brat goes too. And no duh the creature gets from 4 tho 40 ft. tall. The parents come in and retrieve the baby. It's a rip-off to King Kong, Mothra, Godzilla vs. Mothra, Godzilla, Gorgo, and the X from Outer Space. This is simply a tragety and should of never been made."
2,Watch out,"This movie is also called ""Monster from a Prehistoric Planet"". How do I know? I bought both!This movie is about how monsters love their children as much as any person. Its very stupid and worthless. There are bad movies that are lovable and bad movies that should go in the trash. This is the later."
2,"Bad, bad, bad...even for suitmation","Ok, I admit I'm a sucker for really bad cinema, and almost no one makes bad cinema as bad as this. It ranks right up there with the greatest suitmation monster stink bombs in history, including most of the Godzilla series between Godzilla vs King Kong and the Heisei series in the 1990s, and virtually all of the rest of the Toho and Toho-clone stable. There is just something so delightfully awful about the attack of those giant chicken-slash-parrots that makes you want either to fall to the floor laughing or run screaming away from the television (maybe not such as bad thing...) never to watch again. Anyone one familiar with the Red Dwarf TV series might recognize Gappa from one of the episodes as well. I have an idea... Instead of the Golden Turkey, let's introduce the Golden Gappa!"
3,Gappa angry!!! Gappa angry!!!,"Look, it is what it is. A 1960's ""so cheesy it's great"" Asian-made rubber-suit monster movie. If you don't like 'em... don't watch 'em! This one is a classic and as far as I know, this Tokyo Shock DVD release has the best picture quality available, and has both Japanese and English soundtracks. Not much else though, just some liner notes on the film, and the insert graphics look like a bootleg import. I've seen better cover art for this flick (Check out the 3D version). Regardless, I had to have it in my collection. Yongary is next!!!"

5,As Expected!,"Disk arrived in great condition, played fine, and complete with liner notes. I'm glad that this was available at least as a hard copy since it is not available on iTunes or in any other digital download that I could find."
2,These guys are a bit of a letdown...,"While you can tell this band is technically proficient I find the songs go nowhere. I think their music suffers for using only two instruments while trying to be as loud as possible. As a consequence the sound, while heavy, is dull and repetitive. A better experimental heavy album from 2005 would be the newest Fantomas album, ""Suspended Animation"", which also employs a more inventive vocalist in Mike Patton."
5,Bergman and Piper,"Cheesy science fiction movie that will live forever in the company of such movie greats as The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Through the Eighth Dimension, They Live, The Evil Dead/Army of Darkness, Dr Stangelove, Rabid Grannies, a Boy and His Dog and the list goes on!"
4,What would you do if you returned to earth after the Nuclear War and found your high school sweet heart was the ruler?,Def-Con 4 admittedly I did not finish but it is very dated and awesomely bad.Hell comes to Frogtown ... get your friends and some beers cause it is going to be a great night for this epic lost flick.
3,Great old cult classic,"Great old cult classic. Sexy, surreal. I first saw this on TV, but this is the uncut version. If you like campy B-movie scifi (think MST3K), you'll like Hell Comes to Frogtown (and they are frogs)."
2,A leap of faith,"This was one weird movie. Piper is in some crazy stuff, but this took the cake. A future with frog people and women that need to have children by a man that is not effected by radiation was bad enough, but they put a chasity belt on him and take him to the women while they also wanted him was weird. Then the frog woman also wanted him. The acting was really bad in this movie and the story could have been a lot better. This should be a do over."
4,"Babes, Mutants and Action in the Future","Roddy Piper (wrestler and star of They Live) is back in another science fiction thriller. This time it is the future and very few men are fertile. Roddy leaves pregnant women wherever he goes. Because of this, Med-Tech wants him to help with the repopulation of the country so that they can carry on the war that created the mess.But no sooner does Hellman (piper) sign on the dotted line than he is railroaded into an attempt to rescue a group of fertile women from the mutants of Frogtown.What follows is a pretty good film although it is obvious that the budget was not huge. The acting is pretty good and Piper appears more boyish and less sharp-edged than he does in They Live. I particularly liked the frog mutant playing at Sydney Greenstreet's The Fatman. The only thing I did miss was that there was no great one-liner from Piper. He had one of the great lines of all time in They Live.Sure it's campy and low budget but it is also very fun."
3,Frogs just want to have fun (and they do),"This is just another post-apocalypse movie, more of a mad Max or mad Maxine. The frog people are just not pretty faces. Other parts of their body are more versatile. There is no way that Roddy Piper (Sam Hell) can compete so he appeals to their sense of humanity. Propagation is implied throughout the movie. There are even a few sweaty scenes and no one stays in the car.Roddy did a much better job in ""They Live.""This is a combination of ""John Goldfarb Please Come Home"" and ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death (1988)""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death ~ Shannon Tweed"
4,good b grade sci-fi,"funny funny stuff great for us poor folks that got tired of being ripped off by cable and canceling do miss the sci-fi channel hence, my purchase"
4,Here froggy froggy...,This movie... is a complete hoot! It's got it all. Roddy in his best film performance ever! ...machine gun wielding chicks and lots of mutant Frogs that spout hilarious dialogue!There's even a plot about Roddy being one of the last men on the planet with live sperm who has to impregnate fertile chicks!Not up there with Scorcese but this flick rocks!
4,A Saturday afternoon well spent,"I have seen this movie several times in the past, and I enjoyed it a lot. Yes it's campy, but whats wrong with that? This movie is FUN! It never pretended to be Sheakspear, just a good old fashion bad movie for your weekend party, or that three A.M. time slot when you need to watch something, but infomercials and the psychic hotline just aren't your thing. So grab some popcorn and a soda and sit back and enjoy a really good ""bad movie"". you won't regret it."
4,"A camp classic, well worth the re-watch","My dear friend Cec Verrell is in this flick.She steals the show. For more of her try ""Silk"". Roddy and Sandall work well in their parts. The glimps of the future granted here is troubling and still some how funny as hell. Roddy's booby trapped genitals are the running gag . The movie is well worth the watch. Try it after 4:20."
5,Hell Came To My T.V. Screen When I Watched This Movie!!!,"Every now and then I find a very good 'B Grade"" movie at my local video store. Sadly this is not one of them. This movie is set in a Barren (no relation to me!!!) Post Apocalyptic Wasteland where Human Fertility is treasured.Judge Judy is of the opinion that ""any idiot can make a baby"" and I am inclined to agree with her. Then our intrepid Hero named Sam Hell goes to Frogtown in the hope of impregnating lots of women.I did grow weary of all of the women admiring this guy for his ""High Sperm Cell Count"" as if that is something to be proud of.If this guy lived in modern Los Angeles he would be paying Child Support to 15 different women. I give this movie 5 stars because I kind of like the look of the Wasteland that is depicted in this movie."
1,Borderline retarted,"If you want a good laugh, get this. If you wanna see how bad movies can get, watch this...Still very fun to watch but make sure you're not tired..or...you will pass out..."
3,En Vogue before En Vogue,"Arguably, the concept behind the creation of what became En Vogue was first ""test driven"" via this one-album group, 'cause they embodied the class, charm, style and vocal harmonies that EV became famous for. My favorite songs, ""Right & Hype"", ""You Are The Party (I Am The Fun)"" and ""Buggin' Over You"" could've easily been songs recorded by the aforementioned ""Funky Divas of Soul"". Unfortunately, the album's ballads/slow jams (tracks 2 & 7) seem forced and un-natural, as if they were tryin' too hard to convince you they're serious, but that faster tracks (#'s 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 & 10) are what sell this album and ultimately makes it an enjoyable listen, IMO.En Vogue's creators and long-time producers, Foster & McElroy eventually picked up where Teddy Riley and Gene Griffin left off with this group thru EV. Too bad it was just a one-shot deal, 'cause Abstrac' definitely had potential."
4,"Durable, Energy Efficient","Other humidifiers are very weak and easy to break. But this one is durable long time. Very impressive.It consumes 2 Watts in the lowest setting. Very energy efficient.You can use it worldwide because it supports 100~240 volts. Very convenient.One big downside is a noise. I admit that it is much quieter than other humidifiers but I wish it were quieter than now. When I sleep, I can hear very a tiny motor noise even with the lowest setting.This doesn't need any filter change. But keep in mind that you need to buy Water Treatment Additive(WTA) regularly to use this humidifier."
1,Noisy and Doesnt Increase Humidity,"This over priced piece of junk was a waste of money. Like some of the other people on this site, I thought that if I purchased the most expensive I was getting the best. WRONG. Two issues: 1) it doesnt generate much humidity. The water in the tank is only about 2 inches lower after two days of operation and our bedroom is still bone dry. 2) the plastic gears that rotate the disk slip every 5-10 minutes, creating a loud ""stuttering"" noise that wakes us up. I only bought one unit - i was going to get 2 more for the kids - thank god I didnt waste the money.DONT BE FOOLED - this doesnt add humidity and its noisy."
1,not an improvement,"They updated this product a couple of years ago and I have had nothing but trouble with the new model. I have returned two already and the one I have now just shut down. Apparently, I am the only person in the world who is experiencing difficulty with this product. I loved my venta airwasher and have bought several over the past 10 or so years. I keep one in my music room. I will be looking for a new solution to my humidification needs."
2,Not for humidify room,"I bought one WL 25, one WL45, all newest models. With the two running full speed in a 400 sq ft bedroom the hydrometer shows the highest humidity only 38 or 39 (room temperature at 21-23), it seems good for cleaning the air only.In terms of outputting water, it is only one third of my two Swiss air (the only problem with which is the white dust). Venta is dust free but deffinately not for humidifying rooms. Very disappointed."
3,Venta LW44 Air Humidifier,"OK this is a good solid evapator type humidifier. Easy to use, you don't have to change and clean water solution as much as they say, mainly because it does not clean the air in your house. You need another machine to this, a hepa filter. More info check out consumers report."
2,CR rates it low,"Just saw a repost on it from CR and they were not impressed. I love the claim of ""gets stuff down to 10 microns."" 10 microns in the particle world is HUGE! Most debris that size is not even airborne. Even the most basic water filters, for example, are rated at 3 microns."
5,Very fast shipping and great condition,The CD is in excellent condition as indicated on the marketplace and shipping was very fast. No complaints at all. :)
4,Not the Whole Story,You should be aware that this CD omits two selections from the 2 LPs that Green Linnet released from these concerts in the mid-1980s. A new CD (2012) has been issued that includes all the tracks from the original LPs. It's called 'Live' Again and is available from Birnam Records.
1,Worthless shoes,I bought these boots as a Christmas present for my son. He wore them for about 6 weeks before they started to fall apart. After 3 months they were totally worn out and are now in the garbage. The soles separated from the shoe. These boots are worthless in my opinion.
3,"Makes me want to hit my head against a wall, but my kid seems to love it","Makes me want to hit my head against a wall, but my kid seems to love it, June 3, 2008By k tha kool 1 (Beantown) - See all my reviewsI'll be the first to admit that this video is truly heinous. The acting, production value, and songs are atrocious. However, as much as I hate it, everyday when my daughter wakes up or when she gets home from daycare, she asks for ""more bunny!"" And as I sit here typing this, I have one of the songs from this video stuck in my head....making...me...crazy.... My daughter could watch this thing repeatedly for hours, so for that, I have given it 3 stars. It will definitely occupy a kid for 30 minutes when you need to get the dishes done. We got our copy at thrift store for $1. I wouldn't recommend spending any more than that."
1,Just bad,"I just spent $2.99 at Toys R Us, and I regret even spending that! This is so poorly produced. The songs are boring. The kids are of the worst 'child actors' I've seen on a video. Half of them look bored and mad while attempting to sing along with the songs. This is just sad. I'm trashing it. I don't want to subject my kids to such bad acting and boring songs. I want them to know music is fun and have them inspired. I fear this video will zap them all of their creative juices. I'd rather spend three times the money on a Barney video. At least those are well produced with lively kids and catchy songs."
3,Not Much of a Season in Review,"The tape is ""supposed"" to cover the highlights of the Redskins' 1993 season, but the bulk of the footage concerns the team's legacy/history from 1937 to the (then) present day. There are brief interviews with (then new coach) Norv Turner and a couple of the veteran players on the team at that time, but precious few clips of actual gameplay from the previous season (1993): Reggie Brooks' two long TD runs (80+ yards), a long Darrell Green fumble return for TD, and that's about it.note: the tape is recorded in EP mode, so picture quality suffers a bit."
3,:(,"My cats which I have 4 of,don't like this product at all. The only thing they use it for is the two youngest thinks it's a toy and they bat it around. It is dried fish. It looks just like fish and smells like it too. It was cheap to try and truthfully I got this just to get the free shipping anyway so no loss for me."
1,kitty wouldn't touch it,"My cat loves all things fish flavored, but refused to have anything to do with this product. She wouldn't even tolerate it in her food dish. She pulled it out and shoved it off to the side on the floor."
4,Don't Know about cats.... BUT!,I ordered these for my cat but she would not eat them. But that was not unexpected.... she if very finicky! BUT MY DOG LOVES THEM!!!!!! And I would assume these are very good for him. Full of vitamins and good oils! I would recommend them as a treat for small dogs ;-)
4,The Magic of McBride,"Angus McBride is one of the best Military Illustrators on the scene. His work is always interesting , realistic , convincing & coupled with a very sly sense of humor. If your forte is Military History and want an idea of what a warrior looks like from the past. You could do a whole lot worse than this series. (I myself own over 300 of them and use them a lot in my classroom) The only down side of this series is that the written part is usally not up to the caliber of the illustrations."
3,book,god content of the war in afric compare to custer last stand in wyoming----godd drawin g in the book book
3,Not what you may think it is....,"Just a caveat emptor to buyers: the copies of this title currently being offered for sale new are not the Green Linnet issue listed; rights have apparently reverted to the artist and this is a re-issue with a different upc. I don't know why the relatively little trouble required to begin a proper new listing has not been taken, but I would like to spare any other collectors like myself the trouble of having to return an item that is significantly over-priced at $25.00"
4,Good WW1 romance set in Egypt,I am a 13 year old and my mother and I have both read it and think it spans both age groups. I enjoyed the book. We will buy the next book in the series when it comes out.
1,Boring,"Well I didn't think that this book was very interesting. It didn't hold my attention like I thought it should. Sometimes it went on and on about, what I thought, was useless information. It probably is just my taste in books that has made me not like this book so I'm sure I won't read any more of Linda Chaikin's books."
5,my daughter's favorite perfume,"I received it quickly, item as described...no problems. Wouldn't hesitate to order it again....and probably will. My daughter thought it was her best xmas presesnt once again."
5,"Timelessness, beauty, simplicity and poignancy...","This disc was a remarkable find for me - having randomly purchased it in a local shop, I visited Amazon to try and buy another copy as a present for a friend. It's a shame that it's not yet in stock as I'm sure it will give enormous pleasure (as well as haunt) a great many people. Though undoubtedly tinged with sadness Mackevitt's music transcends its own bleak existence and becomes altogether other-worldly. I feel it can communicate on many levels and is certainly moving, especially in conjunction with Derek Jarman's book (""Derek Jarman's Garden"" 1995 & 1996,"
3,Great find if you're looking specifically for this artist,"I had some of Michael Jeffries' songs on a cassette tape in the early 90s and lost it. I was glad to find the CD, and even though I only wanted 2 songs ""Trade Dreams"" and It Don't Get Better Than This"", I was willing to buy the whole cd. In my opinion, he was not given strong material cos the two songs I mention are his best and he blows it out the park on those. So had he been given stronger material he may have had a more successful run. His voice and singing talent are there no doubt...part of showcasing talent is being given the right material and perhaps that is the one downfall of this CD. The material didnt give him the opportunity to do what we sense he can do."
3,Seal Live,Anything seal sings is great and this is no exception. Wish there was an entire live recording but until there is will have to do. See him live if you can. Great show and he's very entertaining. Very smooth.
1,A rush to disappoiment,"Elizabeth Moon has create a wonderful universe, believe military characters, and compromised its appeal with ""Against The Odds."" This addition to the series does not have the raw excitement or passion of Moon's previous works. The story fills out the intrigue, broadens the character development of Esmay Suiza, builds a base for a wonderful follow up book,but will disappoint fans of the series. This is no ""Once a Hero"" nor ""Rules of Engagement"", so if you love the series and have to read it, wait until its in paperback. I wish I did."
1,Don't bother to read this,"I loved Once A Hero, thought Change of Command just okay, but this book was absolutely awful. Save your $$."
4,YES! A much better effort than _Change of Command_,"This installment of the Familias Regnant series has redeemed my faith in Elizabeth Moon. The previous book (Change of Command) was spotty and was more of a ""set-up"" for the events that take place in this book. I must agree with one of the other reviewers, they should have been one book. We get to see more of the irrepressable Cecilia deMarktos, and Heris Serrano of course. This book is about youth growing up -- the younger characters (Brun, Barin, and Esmay) all come into their own, parallelling the maturing that occurs in the Familias Regnant as the issue of the ""diamond ceiling"" of rejuv is tackled. I was very surprised by some of the events that occured in this book, and found the ending to be rather touching.I was hesitant about this book because the previous one just wasn't up to standard; however, I figured that _Change of Command_ was setting the stage for the next installment, and took a chance. Am I glad I did!"
5,Truck Tent,"Fits my 2005 Tacoma perfectly. Took a little effort to get the poles in place, but it went together fine. You will need a tie down in the front of the truck bed, but you can use a loop of 1/4"" nylon rope through the drain holes to anchor the front of the tent."
5,Great Truck Tent,"When I received the tent, I put it together to see how long it would take, took about 20 minutes by myself. When I went camping with it, it took roughly 10 minutes with the help of my friends to get it setup completely. That night it poured down rain, the tent remained perfectly dry with no leaks anywhere. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a fast easy way to camp."
3,It's OK.,"Pros:I love the concept. This tent fits my silverado 1500 shortbed just right. Easy to setup and take down.Cons:Considering the high cost ($199.95), quality of construction is poor. The material is obviously bottom tier. I have a strong feeling that it won't be long before the seams start to come undone.I wanted to give 4 stars, but I just can't get past the poor quality. If the price were lower or the quality higher, I would be a lot happier with it."
5,great camping,"I bought this truck tent last spring for my Dodge Dakota pick-up. The first time I got it up in about 20 minutes but each time has been faster.It now takes ten minutes or less. The directions are good and the color coded poles and pockets make the task much simpler. There is a surprising amount of room inside the tent and good ventilation. Last July 4th, while at the lake, I was caught in one of the worst storms I have ever been out in. Many of the traditional tents were either leaking, flooded or blown over completely. Mine remained dry. I would highly recommend this tent to anyone who is intrested in a truck tent."
3,Another all time favorite horse story,"Horse crazy kids like stories about horses and people that they can relate to...and that offer some realism. (At least I did.) I also appreciated stories that were worth saving and re-re-reading. This one is one of those. Great story, and the ending is not really what you would expect. If you like horses, find this one."
3,Curi Curi - excellent,"""Curi Curi"" was the song written by River Phoenix. It also contained dialogue spoken by him. Pure genius by this wonderful person."
5,Requires assamble and painting,"Great detail, a lot more than the one you'll get in miniatures already painted.This is a set of 6 Rohan riders and horses. They come unassambled and unpainted (gray). If you're a collector with experience painting miniatures or a strategy gamer already familiar with the Lord of the Rings game, this is for you. Otherwise I recommend you start by taking a look at the Tradable miniature game (TMG) of Lord of the Rings. This set is a great addition to someone playing Rohan as an army."
2,Can't even compare to 6th Sense,"This movie is disappointing. The biggest problem is the 'uselessness' until the ending. Aside from the last 10 minutes, this movie isn't even worth watching."
3,slow,"I thought this film had an interesting premise, and was looking forward to seeing it, but when I left the theatre, I was left a little disapointed.The problem was the pace. With the film being part of a trilogy, this was the first, introductory part, and it was far too slow. There wasn't enough in it to warrant a whole film. There is only about 20 minutes left when Willis finally realises what the audience has known from the first 5 minutes, and the superhero action Bruce gets up to is an anti-climax.However, there are some good points. I am sure it will be a lot better as a trilogy if you can stand the length, there are fine performances from all the leads, and the twist at the end just about satisfies because it is less predictable than The Sixth Sense's."
4,Good,This movie was interesting and unexpected. It has Bruce Willis from the Sixth Sense who instead of a doctor person plays a security guard who survives a train crash without a scrath on him but then discoveres something different about him later in the movie or somewhere after the crash. Samuel L. Jackson is creepy as Elijah who's obsessed with comics and believes that the security guard is some kind of 'super hero'. The ending gets good and is shocking and expected. The movie was alright.
3,The title pretty much covers it.,"I enjoyed this more than the Sixth Sense but I have to wonder why they feel compelled to spell out the story in the title.As with the Sixth Sense this is a very, very simple idea (man who can't die; man who is immortal; superman, etc). This story has been told 1000 times. However, there's no denying he does this stuff with style. Reminded me a bit of Dark City. At least this one doesn't have a dumb ""surprise"" at the end like Sixth Sense (of course he was dead all along--he got shot in the gut in the beginning...duh).If this is part #2 of a trilogy may I suggest that Part #3 be a comedy about a guy who's actually alive but thinks he's dead--because he's sick all the time."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Movie","This movie had a good idea for a story, but this movie was slow and boring. I think the whole story could have been told in under an hour. I disliked it so much that I haven't even watched the second disc yet. You can spend your twenty dollars elsewhere on a much more entertaining film."
3,Could have been.....,"M. Night Shyamalan was the mind behind ""the sixth sense"" and this has some similar traits. Bruce Willis plays a character that is troubled and is trying to find his purpose in life. Samuel L Jackson plays a comic book addict, who owns a gallery for those who appreciate ""art"".The two are drawn together and so the movie unfolds. The premise of someone being ""unbreakable"" is laid excellently - it is the way that this is drawn out into a conclusion that leaves you feeling that the movie has been stopped, as opposed to coming to a natural end. The attempt at a ""Sixth Sense"" type twist as the finale almost works, but once again falls short.It was so close to being good!"
2,Complete waste of time,When I first heard about this movie it sounded kind of interesting. But in fact when I saw it it was a HUGE disappointment. The storyline is absolute crap. Right when you think you have the movie figured out it goes and does something totally confusing. They say that this movie is supposed to be a thriller but there's really only one part that's even close to a thriller scene. I advise that you do not waste your time with this movie.
2,Unbreakable,"I thought it disappointing after Sixth Sense. The Comic Book premise is adolescent mumbo jumbo which may appeal to comic book cult members, but the main story line has to be taken with patient hopes that eventually it will come up to the director's work in Sixth Sense. As far as the ending: there had to be words on the screen to wrap up an otherwise dull experience. Save your money and rent before buying."
2,Huh?,I'll keep it short. This movie was such an anti-climax. Bruce was his usual tortured self(but that's cool). The story went so slowly and without any real direction. It just seemed like a lot of filler just to get to the end. Samuel L. Jackson turned in his worst performance to date and really disappointed me because I'm a fan of evertyhing(except for this) that he's done. This could have been a half-hour movie and still had the same impact. This is not he kind of entertainment you pay to see. This was a made-for-tv movie. It should have been on Fox.
3,Whoa!....Not a good movie!,"Okay, the idea was pretty cool, but whoever wrote the script sure made it a boring one. I mean, this movie is too slow. I was glad when it was finally over.It would have made a pretty cool movie if it was written differently."
4,A little boring but with a lot of plot and story,It was a little pridictable but the story was entrertaning and the plot was generaly good although it was strange at times. And a little boring. I liked the overall movie but if you dint like the sixth sence then you will not like this. If you did like the sixth sence then you will probably like this also although in my opinion this movie was not as good as the sixth sence.
2,A great premise can't save this one...,"What a letdown! After the Sixth Sense, I waited with great anticipation for this movie. Unfortunately, Mr. Shyamalan's sophomore effort lacks momentum. The premise is wonderful, Bruce Willis plays the only survivor of a train crash and Samuel L. Jackson plays a fragile comic book collector who believes that not only do superheroes exist but that Willis is one of them. Cool huh? Alas, the story moves so slowly that by the time you get to the ""surprise"" ending, (you'll see it coming, trust me) you feel totally cheated! Way too much prologue and not nearly enough payoff. Rent this one."
2,Unbreakable,When Samuel L. Jackson starts to explain some filosophical nonsense about the deeper meaning of comics in order to point out that Bruces character is a real life superhero this whole film fails to be the clever film it so hard tries to be.
1,M. Night Shyamalan films should be AVOIDED,"This movie had promise but QUICKLY went down hill. Not even the likeable Bruce Willis could do much to save this ridiculous mess. I'm so glad I borrowed it off a friend, rather than rent it.M. Night Shyamalan films are not clever, artistic or even original. He tries to make his films unique but they fail even before the middle of the film. Just look at his other film called ""Signs"". Mel Gibson couldn't save that either. Not even big names can help his movies.Overall, far fetched nonsense films which don't deserve any of our attention. I'll avoid his films from here on."
1,Did I see the same movie the rest of you saw???,I though this movie was absolutely horrible! It is the kind of movie that gets me mad that someone had the nerve to make something so bad! This is in the same category as something like Showgirls! Story was terrible. Directing was terrible. Seemed like they tried to use every cheap gimmicky camera angle trick in the book to try to make it interesting. Didn't work. Terrible movie!!!
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"How can anyone like this movie? It was tedious from beginning to end. That ending! It was awful! ""They called me Mr. Glass......"" and then they show words about how Bruce Willis called the cops on Samuel L.The movie is about some dude who has superstrength and the power to see into peoples's past by touching them so he reluctantly saves two girls but he ends upKnow what? I won't explain the plot. This movie is not worth buying, renting, or watching for free. I am completely serious. I didn't write this review just to bring down the movie's ratings but I truly came in here to stop people from buying this movie. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
1,The Sixth Sense this is not!!!,"This movie is not good.I remember working at a movie theater when this movie was released, and when we had our employee screeing of it, we were all very excited (there was about 15 or so of us who watched it).Maybe we expected too much, maybe we expected another ""Sixth Sense"", which is an amazing film. As we all left the theater (the five of us who hadn't walked out) we felt like it was bad. I even got paid to watch the movie, and I still felt as though I had wasted a precious few hours of my time. Not only watching it, but putting the film together.And what was with the whole comic book thing???? That was just not good!!! I could rant about how bad this movie is all day long, and it still wouldn't make me feel any better. Do yourselves a favor and buy the Kevin Smith movies instead."
2,Good Intentions -- Bad Execution,"I think this is a great example of a director missing the boat. The director obviously looked at his success with 6TH SENSE and thought ""Ah, people really liked the way I weighed it down with all that emotional claptrap. So, in my next movie, I will also weigh down a fairly cool idea with even more heavy handed emotional belly-button gazing. People will LOVE it.""Ah, well, no. People didn't love it. Actually, people liked 6TH SENSE's scares and the twist ending. And while I appreciate the seriousness with which he approaches this superhero tale, he's made a boring art film out of a fairly interesting idea."
5,Unbeatable,"(With Spoilers) Finally, the superhero movie is starting to be taken seriously by directors. Movies such as the X-Men have helped to bring this about, but M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable is the best example of the superhero in the modern day.Bruce Willis's confused hero is a tortured individual who doesn't understand why he feels incomplete and lonely every day, but with the help of Samuel L. Jackson's theories and guidance, he discovers his true nature. The movie is brilliant and raises as many questions as it answers throughout its run - Shyamalan's ethereal feel and use of color as symbolism throughout is well-placed but not obvious, and the interplay between a skeptical yet unhappy Willis and the driven but fragile Jackson is a surprising meld of acting styles that delivers a fantastic human element to the visual masterpiece.If you enjoy hero-based movies and the discovery of true potential, you will enjoy this movie."
2,Bruce is good ..the film .. weak,It seems that David Dunne is not immune to male pattern baldness..but it looks cool Bruce so no offence. This movie is meditative and too self conscious to be entertaining. Bruce turns in a great performance though. There is one ludicrous scene where the son threatens his father with a pistol...cutting floor material!
4,Interesting Premise,"While the subtle comic book setting and story line are interesting, and might even make for good sequel material, I think Bruce Willis needs to lighten up a bit. I don't mean to imply that he is overly melodramatic, but even the gravity of what his character is learning about himself should not preclude the occasional smile, or outright laughter. Perhaps this somberness is a result of writing or directing, but whatever the reason, smile, Bruce, it wont hurt."
1,"wow, this movie fails to deliver","I thought 6th Sense was a masterpiece of plotting and suspense and so I looked very much forward to seeing this outing by the same writer/director. This is a slow, awkwardly paced film with poor dialogue, and leaden acting (think Bruce Willis in 13 Monkeys but without the enthusiasm ;-). It is, as has been written elsewhere here, also incomplete: it not just predicts a sequel, it demands it because the movie itself doesn't stand with its ending. I wish I had rented this."
1,failure,"complete and utter failure. this stunk. the story , acting , and plot were weak. this movie just tottally ... ."
2,Hard to watch.......,"This visually stunning follow-up to M. Night's ""The Sixth Sense"" was very highly anticipated by me and many others who found his first movie breathtaking. To say the least, I was extremely dissapointed. I found the plot twists silly and badly timed. The scene involving Bruce Willis' son pointing a gun at him made me laugh out loud. (His son was so convinced that his father was a superhero, he was going to shoot him to prove it.) Writing like that just makes my stomach turn. I think M. Night made a movie that had a deep personal interest to him, but a gut wrenching car wreck ensued on the screen. Pass on this one."
1,The biggest disappointment,"I saw the previews for this movie months in advanced and I couldn't wait to watch it, just like most of my friends I was excited about this movie. Well let me tell you this movie is so boring and so slow, by the time the suprise ending comes(and its a good suprise ending) you just don't care anymore. Bruce Willis should pay me back my 8.50 for watching this garbage"
1,"Unbearable, Unwatchable, Unbelievable...","Had a similar feeling watching the Sixth Sense - couldnt wait for the movie to end - but i guess we had to ""wait"" for the big plot twist in the end to justify wasting our time watching this directors films - a mistake I won't be making in the future."
1,I didn't need six senses to know this was weak...,"Sixth Sense: Fabulous movie. It was entertaining from the very first scene and it only got better, and the twist at the end, well that made it a classic. As for Unbreakable, Shyamalan decided to have another twist at the end, but this time, he forgot to make the rest of the movie. It was utterly forgettable and weak."
5,One of Bruce Willis's Best Movie!,"This movie was fantastic. If you liked The Sixth Sense, then you need to see this movie. It was great. Anyone who likes thriller/suspense will like this movie. It is one of Willis's best movies and performances. If you are a Bruce Willis fan, see, rent, or buy this movie."
2,Looooooooong wait for a cool ending,"This movie is kind of like watching a baseball game: 3 minutes of action packed in to three hours. OK, the movie isn't that long, but it drags on so long you'd think you could cook a turkey in the time it takes to get to the great ending. Good luck."
2,Was Not What I Expected,"""Unbreakable"" was a disappointment to me. After watching the incredible movie, ""The Sixth Sense,"" I was sure that this film would be excellent. I was wrong. This movie just did not have the same spark that the ""The Sixth Sense"" possesses. The ending made me laugh, and even though this film was not meant to be realistic, the overall premise seemed completely silly. I couldn't believe it when the twist ending was revealed and ended up thinking, ""You've got to be kidding!""I won't say this is a horrible movie, but if I could give advice to anyone who's thinking about seeing this movie, I would say to watch something else."
2,Unbelievable,"Pacing was uneven and I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters or their motivations, like Robin Wright Penn's refusal to live with ""football in her life"" or some nonsense and the kid becoming unhinged when his father refuses to believe he's invulnerable and goes so far as to point a gun at him. Look, kid, if you want to test someone's invulnerability there are better ways than scaring the s**t out of them. I just couldn't buy the premise and the film just overwhelmingly struck me as pretentious. I did appreciate the irony of casting Bruce Willis an ordinary-seeming person and reluctant hero who really is invulnernable as opposed to all the intrepid action heroes he's played in the past."
2,I figured it all out,"This movie said it had surprises in it, but I was able to see right through everything pretty much from the first frame. It is entertaining, I guess, but the whole concept of comic books is silly. A nice diversion from finer films or when Bergman isn't in the video store."
4,New Slant on the Superhero,"This film puts a very unique spin on the comic superhero genre. I just watched it for the second time and felt the director was still finding his way when you compare this to Signs and The Sixth Sense, yet this earlier movie still delivers. Willis and Jackson are great in this - Jackson seemingly born for the role and the creepy edge he brings to the part. A worthy addition to your library and one that must be watched with your son (providing you follow with some discussion on the differences in good and evil)."
3,Great for comic book fans,"In my memory this was a five star movie, but after watching it last night, it's really only a 3 star movie to me.It's dark, almost in a Hitchcock way. The lighting is dark, the music is mostly dark and creepy, there's almost always a sense of foreboding. I think I only saw Bruce Willis smile twice. But Willis was believable and it was interesting to watch his development into a sort of superhero.Samuel L. Jackson has an interesting monologue about how comic books are a type of historical record that I enjoyed. I hadn't ever thought of comic books in that fashion. Beyond that Jackson is a sometimes creepy, sometimes sad character, but a very important one.A friend of mine that is a comic book collector went nuts over this movie, and the ending is pretty awesome, but I don't want to ruin it. It was just a little dark for my taste."
3,Through a lens darkly,"What a wonderful premise -- a superhero among us, one who cannot be hurt provided he avoids his personal ""kryptonite"". The story of his self-discovery, Unbreakable begins with great promise. But the film's ambience is so dark, so unrelieved of foreboding and anxiety, that even a momentary ray of sunshine near the end cannot relieve the dark feelings that the movie creates within us. Then, there is the ending -- the darkness becomes ... well, I guess you ought to see the movie, but I recommend that you rent the DVD before you commit to purchasing a copy. This movie is a true work of art, but there are some works of art that I don't particularly want to display permanently in my home."
2,Mediocre thriller from talented director,"It was fairly suspenseful, the ending was typically surprising, though not amazingly so, but it was unoriginal. I especially found the young boy to be bland, a cross between Haley Joel Osment in The sixth sense and the boy in The Shining. One doesn't know whether to be afriad and disturbed or sympathetic. The premise is rather preposterous, although it might have been engrossing without the superhero sub-plot. When Willis dons a cape-like poncho and heads into the night to go save someone, anyone, the film becomes as transparent as glass, which is interesting because glass seems an overused symbol throughout the film. Overall, its not an awful movie, but it could have been much better."
4,Very interesting,"I found Unbreakable interesting and intriguing. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire film, the slow, methodical way the plot is revealed (the film studios would do well to follow this example). It was great to see something where everything isn't revealed immediately, where some things go unexplained (as in The Sixth Sense). My only real gripe was the explanatory text at the end, we really didn't need that."
5,A great movie,"This movie seems like you either love it or you hate it. I thought it was one of the best movies the year (of course, given the year's other movies it might not sound like much). Why are all these people complaining that it wasn't like ""The Sixth Sense""? It's a completely different movie. The direction was, I thought, better than ""The Sixth Sense"" and the acting was just as good. Best advice- go in without any expectations."
3,seen the movie,"I don't have this on DVD, but I saw Unbreakable at the cinema today. Unlike the negative customer reviews I've seen on the first page I liked this film. It lacks the special effects and constant action prevalent in most Hollywood films nowadays but that is a good thing. I liked the fact Willis plays a flawed, believable hero. The ending was a little unexpected, but it didn't detract from the film for me."
3,Night uses same techniques as in 6th Sense...,"First half of the film I enjoyed what he was building... but was definitely disappointed in the 2nd half... I figured out the color scheme he was using (alas, 6th Sense technique (red)), green=good, all other primary solid colors = villians and thought that was kind of a rip-off of his first movie... Was hoping for something similar but not an exact copy of his earlier techniques... Ending with the sub-titles was very weak and left the audience ""That's it?!?"". But this is a planned trilogy so that's why there's a lot left to be desired... I have faith in Night to develop this further... The battle has only begun!"
3,Not so good movie.........But bruce willis i still love ya!!,When I first picked up the movie and saw it in its case i watched it because the cover is the only thing that got to me.It looked like a intence thriller!But guess what it is not.The only thing that was good about it was the ending when everything came togeather. Rachel
2,Broke,"I was waiting for this film.M. Night proved his storytelling ability in his last film, but just rushed everything about this movie.There are two nice scenes, but it's not enough to support the film. The bulk of this movie is actually TNT/TBS caliber.Samuel L. Jackson's scenes are so scripted, and he performs them that way. Poor performance.M. Night may be getting too big for his own [good].... Be careful M."
2,A Waste of time,This whole movie was like the introduction to a bigger and better movie. With some severe editing and about another 300% more plot to tack onto the end it might have been a good movie - you get my point? Don't waste your time. ;)
5,Unbreakable,"I don't have a lot to say about this movie, I'm not a film critic. But I did notice one thing that i haven't seen anyone else point out. If you look at The Sixth Sense in its most basic sense, it is a ghost story. But then the director took this remarkably fresh take on that worn out concept. Well, that is exactly what he has done again with Unbreakable. Only, this time his attention is focused on a different worn out concept: comic book movies. If you look at it in this light, I think the film has a much greater impact."
3,""" Unbreakable holds together""","Ok, I'm probably the last one on the planet who saw this movie but let me say this-I really didn't think it would be as good as it turned out to be. Willis and Jackson have always been two of my favorite actors but I especially like their team here. Willis plays an Unbreakable man who is a quiet, tortured soul. Jackson plays his opposite (in almost every way). Two or three parts of the movie do drag a bit but you can forgive that because the last5 minutes save the movie....If your renting-get the dvd version, the deleted scene bonus is cool (if you can forgive the directors commentary)."
1,unbreakable,This has got to be the worst waste of time I have ever spent watching a movie(?). Bruce Willis should be ashamed of himself for allowing someone to get him into this part. Very very dumb movie. I would recommend it to NO ONE.
1,"The ""greatest movie"" I DON'T THINK SO!","What a bad movie and a waste of time and what an insult to the intelligence for anyone to watch this awful movie and a stupid plot. God, awful movie, don't even bother!"
2,...incomplete...,"It is because of the success achieved by Sixth Sense that this movie was given any credit at all. The plot is decidedly incomplete, and although the following two sequels may fix this problem, this installment simply cannot stand on its own. It would be the equivalent of only watching the first half of Sixth Sense and having to wait years for the rest to be released in order to truly enjoy the movie."
1,1 of the 10 worst films of all time,"If you even see this movie whether it is just in the box or playing, do yourself a favor and run the other way as fast as you can. It is boring, I don't care if it is misunderstood or what it will just plain bore you to tears. It's an uninteresting twist on comic book super heroes, and what comic superhero can be so great if all it takes is a squirt gun to eliminate you."
4,I was intriged from the first flash!,"Bruce Willis plays a very normal person, who turns out to to be a true hero. The way he acts has always intriged me... but this must be his best til now. And of course Mr. Jackson plays his roles ever so eloquently. The movie intriged me from the first flash... in the train... I knew nothing of the movie before I went to see it... just that Jackson and Willis played in it together. I like to be surprised... I like to NOT listen or read to others' comment, but totally form my own opinion. And this movie is one of those that I am glad I did not know anything about. To me, the story is a very original one... a never seen before story (by me, that is). The hero/villain concept has been emphasized ever so nicely. Very good... a 5 star for my first review"
1,Disapointment,"If you are expecting another 6th Sense like I was you'll be very disapointed. It starts off slow and stays slow. The moments of silence are overwhelming, you might as well bring a pillow. When the ending came all I could think is ""I hope this isn't the ending"". By all means go see the 6th Day."
2,Unbreakable? More like unbelievable...,"Or unoriginal. Take ""The Sixth Sense"", add ""X-Men"", throw in a little Jules Winnfield and this is what you get. I tried my best to concentrate through all hour and 46 minutes so that I could see another ""shocking"" Shyamalan twist ending. I was rewarded: it turned out to be the funniest part."
1,A parabolic trajectory...,"...describes the development of this film.The first hour and a half: momentum builds impressively, intriguing direction. Next half hour: levels off a bit, nervous glances all round, where will it drop? Final five minutes: the revelation... is that it?More firecracker than Cruise missile; terribly disappointing ""twist"". Do yourself a favour - ask someone whose seen the film to tell you the ending, and spend the cash on something more worthy. Sorry, Night, must try harder."
1,C'mon already,"Pacing. In a word that was this films biggest problem. Not to mention lack of plot. I saw this movie in the theaters and was not at all surprised when a man sitting a few rows behind me stood up and yelled ""C'mon already."" However the real shock came when no one in the theater even responded to this out burst. Bascially this would of been a great short film. However it dragged on for nearly 2 hours. I am generally a great fan of both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson and I greatly enjoyed The Sixth Sense. But even the ""surprise"" ending was a tremendous let down. Despite a few amusing scenes, this film rates very high on my don't waste your time list."
3,It's not the sixth sense,Rent this movie before you buy it. Also don't expect to see the sixth sense. I liked this movie but I watched it without expecting too much. The ending was great and very unexpected. I would have given it 4 stars if they had shown more of the train scene.
4,Movie Misconceptions,This movie is great if you go into it realizing before hand that it is a comic book movie and nothing else. Don't watch it expecting Sixth Sense cause you're not gonna get it. Superhero lovers will enjoy this movie.
4,"Unbreakable - it's not a simple ""comic book"" movie","I have no idea why people are giving this movie 1 or 2 stars. I only ""assume"" that they are used to the usual American action movie pacing. No, this is not Batman or Die Hard, but yes, the movie is somewhat complicated, interesting, relatively original, and has a languid pacing that builds up suspense.I felt it was a good movie with an interesting ending, which unfortunately felt a little rushed. This is why I gave it 4 stars. If the second movie in the trilogy comes out, the first one will be able to stand much better.Vadim"
5,Cult Classic,"Not every one was a comic book junkie as a kid, but this movie will appeal to those that were. Super heros are making an impression with the Fantastic Four and Spiderman at the top of the box office recently. A different roll for Bruce Willis. If you haven't seen the Sixth Sense and like this movie, get it too. If you have seen The Sixth Sense and liked it, get this one too."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Unbreakable is the legend of a real life superhero, brought to you by M. Night Shyamalan. The idea is profoundly unique and the cast is great, but I really didn't like how it turned out. The first half of the movie was awesome, but as Shyamalan movies tend to do, it got weird, in this case too weird for me. While I love Samuel L. Jackson, his character was just annoying and I didn't really consider him a threatening villain. Bruce Willis on the other hand was terrific, but his character was just naturally dull. Shyamalan wanted to keep the story as real and believable as possible, but a superhero who just can't get hurt and has no other real powers is just kind of stupid. I love the uniqueness of the story, but the film just didn't do much for me."
3,Unbearable!,"This movie could have been so much better! It plods along so badly during the first hour that it becomes a ""maybe it will get better"" thing quickly. It does get better, but then dies at the end with a conclusion that is so unsatisfying it looks like someone said ""Jees! We've run awfully long, we better stop!""Bruce Willis features a range of two expressions during the movie and Samuel F. Jackson acts his part as if he is the Addams Family butler, Lurch. I kept expecting him to ask ""You Rang?""The sixth sense should have come out after this film, to redeem the career of the director, but of course he may not have been given a second chance after churning out this thing."
2,Not very smart,"Unbreakable is passable entertainment as long as you're renting and not actually buying a DVD or paying full theater prices. It's just not very well thought out. Willis has to question his wife and son to figure out if he's ever been sick. Well, it turns out he's never ever been sick a day in his life. If you'd never ever been sick a day in your life, wouldn't you know that? Never missed a day of work -- wouldn't you know that? This is probably a laugh-out-loud comedy to Cal Ripken. There were numerous instances such as this when my friends and I turned to each other and wondered what had happened to the sharp, logical screenwriter of The Sixth Sense. The pacing is the same as The Sixth Sense, but it had a purpose there -- here, it's just lethargic filmmaking. And the ending, well -- I didn't see it coming, but I didn't much care, either. ""Unbreakable"" is not the word I would give to M. Night Shyamalan's winning streak."
3,Unbreakable?,"Hmmm... this is a strange one... For the first two thirds of this film, I was captivated: Original story idea with plenty of suspensful (?) moments. Samuel L Jackson's character is great and is a breath of fresh air from his usual roles. However, there was one point which seemed to be the most gratutitous example of product placement that I've ever seen (featuring a carton of Tropicana fruit juice), and from that point on it seemed to go comically downhill. The 'twist' at the end appeared obvious from about halfway through, and it all seemed to end quite abruptly. I was left feeling afterwards that the film was more of an introduction (similar to the X Men) rather than a complete work in itself. Obviously I would say to watch it and make up your own mind, but personally, I didn't think it was a patch on The Sixth Sense."
3,"Unbreakable, one of their best ones yet...","I don't know why these other gibronies hated the movie but I think it was great. Its a really good movie because it has an unexpected ending and the plot is solid. Samuel L. Jackson plays a not too ordinary person to ""help"" Bruce Willis in a way. After a bizzare accident Jackson has come to think he is Unbreakable. Indeed the whole movie seems like something Hitchock would have made, in fact, I can see Hitchock in heaven or something thinking, ""Damn, I wish I thought of that!""Unbreakable is Unexpectedly awesome Unpredictable"
3,A 30 Minute story squeezed into 2 hours,"I kept waitng for something exicting to happen which is really the only thing that kept me on the edge of my seat. If it wasn't for the twisted ending which really wasn't so terrific anyway, I would have considered this a total waste. Rent it at best...add it to your library is very iffy. A 30 minute story whith a LOT of filler....I really couldn't even begin to imagine was was cut from the original."
4,Unbreakable is almost Unbeatable!,Unbreakable is a very unique and wonderfully done silent thriller. The cast is outstanding and the plot line is one of the most original ideas i have ever seen. The ending of this film is outstanding totally blowing my mind. This is a must have...4 1/2 stars.
3,Some thrilling scenes but falls short,"Very dark and too brooding on subplots that did not add to the overall storyline. Although stretching the imagination, the story does become believable ( that a super-hero could exist). The film spends too much time on the stagnant relationship with his wife and on the central character's feelings of depression. Although several scenes had me on the edge of my seat, the pace of the movie seemed to be too slow for long stretches. The plot could have been a lot tighter (such as in the 6th sense). Glad I waited for the DVD and didn't go to the movies on this one."
3,"If you like the sixth sense, you might not like unbreakable","Unbreakable is far different from the sixth sense. Unbreakable is told as a comic book: A superhero learns of his powers & has his weekness, & his enemy. If you watch the film, & sorry if im spoiling the film, you have to watch the beginning to discover the hero. the middle to discover his powers & weekness, & the end to discover the enemy. It's quite suprising but i did not like it but in order to understand this film you have to understand the concept of a comic book. In the beginning a man named david dunn gets into a train wreck, killing over a hundred, except him. Then a lonely man notices him who runs a comic store discovers he has the story of a superhero as the film progresses. and as you will see this man is unbelievable. Some what unbreakable. I recommended it for fans of comic books, but not really for fans of the sixth sense."
1,Can't believe I sat through this thing,"I like the actors, so I sat through this for their performances and I kept thinking something in the story would make it worth it. Sadly, I was wrong and that's a chunk of time I can never get back. Awful. Lame. If it was an option, I'd give negative stars."
1,Just Awful!,"No character developement... No sympathy for any of the people in this movie. The surprise ending was extremely stupid and very difficult to believe. If you haven't seen it, don't! Instead go watch The Sixth Sense again or go rent a good Hitchcock film. What a sad waste of time and money."
1,NOT as good as Sixth Sense,"Interesting at first, then just drags on until its dumb ending. But to give it some credit, the ending is not what I was expecting. The scenes don't really fit together real well. And, characters keep popping up and disappearing through out the movie. Also, in my opinion, the dialog between the characters could also use some work.But there is also some good in this movie. Very few though."
1,Incredibly slow.,"I actually fell asleep during the movie, had no idea how long I was sleeping, but didn't miss a thing. This was the most agonizingly slow movie I've seen in a long time."
3,Unbreakable turns upside down,"I am sure you have heard of M Night Shyamalan, director for Sixth Sense. And his latest effort, Unbreakable seems to be going off hand. No doubt, it has its own story line which proves to be related to comic-strip and superheroes, the characters for David Dunne (Bruce Willis) is exaggerated with myth and reality. I don't see the point of a character coming into life and playing a superheroes like Superman. Night might have got his inspiration from a comic store, but this show is not the type for me although I truly respect his earlier works. Watch this movie only if you consider him a fan !"
2,Unwatchable is right.,"This movie s-cked big time. Awful story, script, acting, etc. It made Battleship Earth look like Schindler's List. M. Night Stinkylan is the most overrated director ever."
2,I still don't get it,"This movie totally sucked! It only deserves two stars because Samuel L. Jackson & Bruce Willis are in it. They must of needed the money really bad to make this movie. If you have a choice between a funeral and this movie, choose the funeral!"
2,Un-bearable,"This guy's (Shamylaman) stretchin' like elastic. Premise is silly, naive, and I'll say silly once more. It lost me big time when Jackson's character told Willis' he became a security guard because he ""wanted to help people"". I've been a security guard; they're the vast semi-employable with no skills: technical, people, or otherwise. And in comparison to 'Sixth Sense': amount I believe it's possible to see dead people-8%; amount I believe there are super-heroes walking the Earth-0%. There are some good scenes, but it matters not one wit. M. Night, obscurity calls."
2,Hilariously overrated,"I have to laugh when I read reviews,such as one below,about how this movie is 'misunderstood' now,but will be seen as a masterpiece in ten years.In ten years,this movie will be completely forgotten.This is more of Shyamalan's ponderous filmmaking,unbearably tedious,complete with lousy script and sleepwalking actors.Watching movies such as 'Unbreakable' almost makes one forget how magical movies can be.People who think they like this sort of glacial dreck should try watching some of Hitchcock's or Kurosawa's films.Shyamalan is the perfect director for today's hollywood--all hype,zero substance."
3,"Interesting but should have been called ""Unremarkable""",I think this crew should have sat on the script another year and polished it a bit more. The extras are nice - but without a truly memorable film - they are less interesting.
1,One third of a Movie,This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. I felt like they made an entire movie out of the first act of the story. The ending was predictable and very lame. I am really glad I didn't buy this DVD.
2,Hmm...With apologies to Mr Jackson,"Interesting story line. My biggest complaint, I have a daughter with O.I. and as much as I love Samuel L Jackson's work, he was way to big and healthy for the role. The only way a man as big, strong and healthy looking could convince me he had O.I. is if he was one of those rare actors who could inhabit the role and become the fragile person the character was meant to be. I have not known many actors who could convincingly become that which they most certainly are not. It is a rare talent. I once had an acting instructor, 20 something at the time, with no make up, costume or props, he transformed himself into a little old man, before the entire class. That is a rare talent. This said, if you can ignore or get past this incongruity the movie is a fine piece of imagination and execution in all other ways."
3,No comparison to other M. Night Shyamalan films,"Unbreakable is overwhelmingly underwhelming as a movie. It has slow, deliberate pacing and takes itself far, far too seriously. It took Bruce Willis an hour and eighteen minutes to even entertain the idea that he had special powers, when the viewer knew it from square one. Knowing that this is an M. Night Shyamalan movie, viewers can expect a big twist of a pay-off at the end of the movie, and Shyamalan doesn't disappoint. It's not clear if the journey is worth it, however."
2,M. Night Shyamalan - sick of the name yet?,"This is an interesting movie but as with all of his movies, extremely slow-paced - i fell asleep the first time. Despite the image of his name being presented to you in huge letters at the beginning and end of his films, shyamalan's apparent image of himself as the 'hottest' filmmaker in hollywood and the incessant self-promotion seems only to accentuate the impression that shyamalan is a good deal over-rated. 'Signs' as well was a disapointment."
4,What happened to Night?,"Bruce Willis is great in this movie. What's with S.L. Jackson's hair? Night still had ""it"" when he made this film. Wheels fell off after Signs though."
5,simply great,i always hoped such a movie would be directed someday i really enjoyed the movie its one of the best movies ive seen in recent years. well done to the director for such a creation and bruce willis was simply great.this movie will remain in my library for a long time.
4,"a clever, original masterpiece","this film clearly showed us all that m. night shyamalan is the present day ""Hitchcock"" With the sixth sense already under his belt, unbreakable shocked everyone in that this guy is one great film maker. it has everything you want in a movie, suspense, originality, and the element of surprise. if you like original films with great twists, unbreakable is a must for the dvd enthusiast. the extras in this dvd are also awesome!!"
3,Unexpectedly Not Very Good,"Overall, the movie isn't terrible, but was often slow and boring. One of the most dissapointing things about the movie was the anticlimatic ending. Just a bad attempt at making a clever twist."
2,"Great movie, glitched Blu-ray","Unfortunately, the lossless PCM 5.1 soundtrack of this Blu-ray disc suffers from loud popping/distorion in the right surround at timecode 8:30-8:32, as well as in the center channel at 1:28:21. There are also other areas where less noticable distortion occurs. None of these errors are present in the disc's lossy Dolby Digital soundtrack nor in the DVD's lossy DTS soundtrack, so it is clear that Disney dropped the ball in encoding the lossless PCM soundtrack. For the price they are charging for this release, I hope they set up a replacement program with a new pressing to remedy the defective PCM 5.1 soundtrack. I recommend avoiding this disc until Disney addresses the issue."
2,Shatters under scrutiny,"One of my friends loved this movie, another completely hated it. I remember being somewhere in the middle after seeing it in the theater. The silliness of the movie's main conceit didn't bother me-after all, the movie is about comic books. What bothered me the second time around is that it really isn't a very good movie. Is Bruce Willis supposed to be the same ghost that he played in The Sixth Sense? Is every movie that Shamalan makes going to be about bland people in a bland world? The brightest thing in the entire movie is a Tropicana orange juice carton. I think rather than watching another Shamalan movie (I'm sure Mel Gibson's character in Signs will be every bit as lifeless as the protaganists in Shamalan's other two movies) I'll check out some Hitchcock, who at least knew how to meld humor and energy with tension and suspense."
3,OK for TV,No worth buying... unless you get it from auction. VERY slow.The 'surprise' ending is the same as if you were running and fell down just before the run ends....kind of disappointing to say the least.
2,I was bored...,"I personally did not like this movie. It was my husband's idea to purchase this particluar DVD. He enjoyed it. Maybe it is a ""guy flick."" I just felt bored with it. The movie is slow going and difficult to follow. At the end I felt it was unfinished and bizarre. This is not one of Bruce Willis's best movies. I just could not get into it. This is just me..."
4,"awesome, nerve shattering, thriller with a twist........","i loved it! but it took me 2 viewings to really apreciate the plot and especially that jaw dropping twist at the films climax. the acting by all is splendidas is the great, eerie musical score! the thx dts sound and picture quality rank way up there! i really enjoed this film even more than the sixth sense! rent it or buy this one-you wil be on the edge of your seat!"
4,Very underrated,"This is a thinking person's movie, which is why so many people hated it. It's slow, but the pace makes it all the more realistic and engaging. Great story and acting, it's just good... but short-attention spanners won't have the patience for it... oh well."
3,Not Your Father's Superhero,"This is a superhero film, but nothing like The X-Men or any superman film. This is a quiet, subdued kind of film that takes a look into superheroes in a new sort of way that only Shyamalan could do.I would love this film if I could have seen more of it!With letter-box cutting out what amounts to 2/3rds of the picture on my TV set, I didn't know what was going on half the time. If there is only one flaw, this is it. I may never get a large screen TV, and don't know how many who will, but it would have been wiser to make this DVD come in both letter-box and full screen so more people could enjoy this awesome film. It is truly worth seeing just for the quiet performances of bruce Willis and Samual L. Jackson.Ron"
3,A dish that could have used some spicing.,"I didn't really know what to expect when I rented this movie. But I can honestly say that I was dissapointed.I adore Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson so I was assuming that this movie was going to be quite a bit better, or at least have more action. I wasn't dissapointed in the acting, but at how slow the movie was. It needed more substance to it.When Bruce Willis finally pulled a Neo and had faith in himself the movie downplayed it so much. I was waiting for the scene to take my breath away. I was also a little upset that he had never noticed that he had been sick. Most people tend to observe this in the course of a lifetime. But anyway...Not a bad film if you aren't expecting much. I would watch it again, I can say that much. Don't expect a action flick. This is more of a movie that shows a personal struggle emotionally and physically in the characters."
1,Unwatchable,Unbreakable was a truly awful movie that combined a sophmoric plot and Bruce Willis at his worst. Who needs to spend 2 hours watching Bruce wander around moping? Good camera work can't save a bad picture.
1,WASTE OF TIME,Best thing about this movie was the trailer...Terrible movie.. had some potential... half way through i was still eager to watch.. but the end is LAUGHABLE....Terrible.
1,We're looking up at the bottom of the barrel.,"Terrible, terrible terrible. What else can one say - Willis is wooden, Jackson is so preposterous it's cringeworthy. The film has no redeeming features, it trundles along at a speed that a slug would be scornful of. The plot I found to be ridiculous - no matter how much I suspended my disbelief. My advice would be to keep your money and start a stamp collection - it would definately be more interesting."
1,"Please, somebody stop him!","Stupid, boring and irksome. Proves that Shyamalan wasn't just a one hit BLUNDER after the just slightly less stupid Sixth Sense."
1,Absalutely Terrible!,"I went to see this movie in theaters and was horrified at how terrible it was. I thought the script had too many holes in it, and the movie was completely over dramatic. I can't say enough about how bad Bruce Willis was in this movie! He thought keeping an expressionless face the whole movie was called acting, and he tried too hard to capture the Sixth Sense all over again. The one positive thing I can say about this movie was it's directing. I really think M. Night Shyamalan has a great future, but this movie should be locked up and never shown anywhere ever again. Save yourself the agony and don't see this movie!"
2,unbearable slow,"This story had a lot of potential. But I had the feeling that the director was trying to be too clever. From the very first camera shots in the train between the seats to the very slow and soft dialogue.The movie moved along very slowly and the ending, although far fetched was resonably good."
1,Maybe I'm Smarter,"I read a review of Unbreakable in the Cincinnati Enquirer and the writer said the movie was great. He also said that the ending was some surprising twist. Either I'm smart or this man was extremely dumb.Unbreakable is not good. The ending has no twist. I guessed it in the first five minutes. That is incredibly disappointing.The best part of the movie, without giving away too much, is the action scene. that's right. there is basically one action scene. If there had more action, I might have liked this movie more.My 16-year-old-brother was bored for the first hour of this movie and my mom fell asleep for a half-hour of the movie.IGNORE the hype for this movie. Save you money. Sixth Sense was good. Unbreakable is not."
1,"If there were negative stars, this movie would get one","This is a total mess. The kind of movie you are glad not to have spent money about. I wonder how many people got out of a movie theater literally swearing about this ridiculously slow, inconclusive, mass of nonsense. How did this script find a producer to finance it, I will never understand."
1,Another M. Night Shyamalan disaster,"Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson do their best, but are undone by the ultimate auteur of our age, M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan's films are characterized by being plodding and moody, always with a ""surprise"" ending. Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire. At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like. Shyamalan is in this latter group.If you like any other of his films, you're probable slow enough to like this one. Otherwise, avoid at all costs!"
1,A bit silly,I rented this movie because M. Night Shyamalan made it. After watching it I'm glad I didn't buy it. It's a bit too stupid for me. It's a comic book movie but it doesn't look like one. Bruce Willis does not look like a super hero and this doesn't seem like a movie about a super hero. This movie is geared towards adults but is dumb enough for little kids. I doubt this would even make it as a comic book. If you're a comic fan go watch Spider-Man or Daredevil. If you're a M. Night fan go watch Sixth Sense or Signs. Leave this one on the shelf.
2,Somewhat a dissappointment,"After ""Sixth Sense"", I was expecting a twirl of senses at the end of this movie. I did'nt necessarily enjoy this movie. The mystery and science fiction was gone..Bruce Willis plays a superhuman loser and most of his experiences are downers. Hardly worth a rental."
3,"An honest, but disappointing, effort","M. Night Shyamalan has a great ability to take a perfectly normal situation, and add just a touch of the unexplainable, to make an interesting story.This is as much the case with ""Unbreakable"" as with his previous success, ""The Sixth Sense"".Unfortunately, where ""Sixth Sense"" succeeded with its ghostly mysticism, ""Unbreakable"" seems comparably infantile with its exploration of a man who discovers he might be a ""superhero"".Bruce Willis does very well as a man coming to terms with his unique situation. Samuel Jackson is appropriately aloof and dramatically offbeat. But the premise ultimately dooms the picture; modern audiences are more willing to suspend disbelief to accept the existence of ghosts and mediums than they are to accept the existence of superheroes."
3,"High on Style, Light on Content","I wanted very much to love M. Night Shyamalan's next film after The Sixth Sense, but going away from it I only just enjoyed it. Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson give amazing performances, and the film is very well directed - even if the film progresses very slowly. The film is well composed, and it may well be the best effort in bringing comic book superheroes into a more real world. However, the film is lacking in it's scope. It seems like more of a prelude to a greater story. If someday it is, this film is an excellent start. Unfortunately, if it has to stand on it's own, it's far from a complete package. The video presented here is excellent, as is the Audio. Buena Vista's new Vista series holds some promise, but it's a bit dissapointing that M. Night did not choose to do a commentary for this release."
2,Unbreakable Didn't Break New Ground,"Unbreakable could have been written as an episode for the Twilight Zone. Meaning, the story could have been told in 30 minutes. All that was built up ends in a Twilight Zone type twist ending, yet it is a disappointing one. The film making is stylish and moody, but the pacing is too slow. Also, the Samuel Jackson character as well as Spencer Treat Clark as Bruce Willis' son are hard to sympathize with. I'm a comic book collector, and this movie did not put ""fanboys"" in a good light. I think a lot of people were not impressed with this movie. Just look in the Amazon.com ""Used MarketPlace"" and you'll see why."
3,Felt like there was no suspense.,"I just wasn't impressed with this movie. Felt like the writing was off, it just didn't have any suspense...there was a question, but no suspense."
3,"Great story, until the end","Great premise, characters, and camera directions; however, the ending could have been so much better. I will not give anything away (for the .0000001 percent who have not seen the movie. The movie concludes with text explaining some things and I cannot stand that! Use text for subtitles, locations, and time."
4,Why Not?,"I really enjoyed this film. It's an interesting perspective on the true comic book hero. I think the reason people did not like this film because everyone expected another Sixth Sense, and it's not. The movie gives you an insight on how a real life hero comes to grasps with his powers and his purpose in life. Unbreakable's hero struggles with his true identity much like Superman, Wolverine, or Hulk must have struggled when they first discovered their purpose in their comic book world's. People believe more in ghosts, than comic book heros. If this film would have been presented as a tribute to comic books, maybe people would have enjoyed it more!"
3,A Good Movie,"Somewhat random thoughts...It's an entirely different movie than the Sixth Sense. While it's not in the same league as the Sixth Sense, it doesn't suck. The movie is a 'slow burner', but the payoff makes it worth it...barely. The payoff isn't nearly as good as the Sixth Sense, but how many times can movie magic of that magnitude be replicated? If people had no idea who directed this, I doubt that anyone would accuse it of being a 5 star movie. The packaging for Unbreakable is gorgeous. There are 2 discs, one for the movie, one for the Special Features. The deleted scenes look and sound every bit as good as the movie itself, and appear in Widescreen format. Recommended."
1,a really bad movie,This movie was very boring and don't ever buy it or even see this movie. THe director tryed to make another deep movie like the 6th sence but failed. the ending is sooo horrible and stupid.
1,"A very, very, very silly movie","Having liked ""Sixth Sense"" very much, I was hoping to see another good movie from the same director. Sadly, this was not the case. I like science fiction, I like movies about the supernatural, I like mysteries, and I love comic books. I also appreciate thoughtful and thought-provoking explorations of racial issues. This movie had a lot of potential but instead just made a silly muddle out of everything."
1,Unwatchable,"This movie is more painful than a root canal. I am an avid movie viewer, of all types but this movie finally cought my attention during the credits. By the time you figure out what the movie is about (if you are still awake) it is over. Poor filming, very few developed characters. The previews and trailers are very misleading. As a fan of both actors and The Sixth Sense I was very disappointed. This movie had much going for it but never made it."
2,UN - Important!!,"This is truly my greatest disappointment this year. Having seen the 6th Sense I was mistaken to believe that this film would have anything to do with the first. I was wrong!! This film lacks rhythm and meaning, although the story isn't awful the director manages to completely destroy any potential it has. It is so slow and annoying that it is almost painful. Bruce Willis is good but the dialog is hilarious, Samuel Jackson is trying to give emotional weight to a rather bizarre character and the result is just not quite what he indented. I only hope future films from Salaman will follow the guidelines from his previous attempt..."
1,Boring. Too slow paced. Lame effects. Poor Plot.,"What is the big deal with M. Night Shyamalan? He can't write, can barely direct, and his movies are uninspiring bores.About 20% of this movie was tolerable. I thought I was going to wear out the FF button on my DVD remote!IF you want mystery, adventure, or action, you'd find more watching paint dry. Although paint drying would probably hold your interest longer than any part of this movie.Way over-rated."
2,Unbreakable is Unwatchable,"I loved ""The 6th Sense"" and my entire family saw it several times. So, our expectations were high for ""Unbreakable"". The entire family was greatly disappointed without exception. In particular, the kids were almost angry.My 14 year old son described it best as a ""cheesy movie that doesn't know it."" I agree that the movie is a victim of its own pretentious style. Give this plot to Carrie and another director and you might have a decent movie."
1,All hype,This movie is all hype. They're trying to ride off the success of The Sixth Sense. Don't waste your money.
1,What A Massive Piece of Overhyped Crap,"No question that the Sixth Sense was a phenomenal motion picture with an ending no one could have guessed (despite what they say now). But this one just falls completely flat. M. Night Shyamalan's direction is straight out of an undergraduate film class, the pace is slower than a diseased snail, and the plot is ludicrous at best. An unlike the Sixth Sense, you can smell the ""surprise ending"" here a mile away."
4,Brilliant...,"I understand why many people did not like this film. Out of all my friends, I'm the only one that thinks this film is better than average. The movie moves a little slow and it's been pointed out to me that since I used to collect comics the movie is more appealing to me, although I don't think that has anything to do with why I like this movie.The movie is an expression of Bruce Willis's character. The slowness and darkness of the movie emphasize his dissatifaction with his life- that he hasn't found his purpose. The idea of the movie centers around the concept that fictional heros are an exaggeration of real people and that superpowers are an exaggeration of human instinct. The movie picks up as Willis begins to find meaning in his life.The only reason that I did not give this movie five stars is because of some of the questionable angles and shots M. Knight Shyamalan used that I thought detracted from the movie. Other than that the movie was brilliant."
3,I was entranced until the very end...,"...and then I was totally disappointed. I have to remind myself that this was written more in true comic book style, where there are odd and unbelievable bad guys, who are just plain silly in their 'evil powers'.I was totally into the movie, loving it, couldn't wait to see how it turned out. But about 1/2 way through, I had already figured out what was going on, and instead of being a crazed evil villain, the bad guy came out appearing more pathetic and insane than anything else.The premise of the story is a good one, I just think it fell flat at the end."
5,Night Does it Again.,"After being the sole survivor from a devestating train wreck strange things start happining to David Dunn when he meets Elijah. This chilling movie will leave you to ponder right up to the end, then when you get there your mind is challenged with another one of Shyamalan surprise endings. I highy recomend this classic film."
3,I love Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson...,"But the rest of the movie SERIOUSLY LACKED!!! It has a slow plot and when you feel like you're finally getting somewhere, the movie is 3/4 over! The end was anticlimatic. I would have rather watched an episode of HEROES or the cat pooping on the lawn."
4,...THEY CALLED ME MR. GLASS...,"This is definetely better than the sixth sense but not as good as M. Night Shyamalan's most recent film Signs which is awesome. But I found this movie awesome and the part that is just awesome is when He goes down to the place where people and that music where the drums are playing an awesome beat starts. This movie is great so rent it first then buy it. (If this is useful to you I also have a review for Signs where I give it 5 stars, the review is called IT'S HAPENNING."
2,"A dull, slow movie","This movie moves like it was shot in slow motion. Bruce Willis seems to sleepwalk through the entire thing, and even the action scene fails to excite. Comic books play a significant part in the film and Shyamalan shot everything to look like it was framed in a comic panel. Sometimes this works, but once you notice the technique, it becomes annoying. Scenes that should be intimate, like a conversation between Willis and Jackson, are shot from far away to frame them between fence posts, instead of close up. Overall, very artificial. The ending is not a surprise, but it is hardly satisfying. The best part about this movie is Samuel Jackson, who, as always, provides a fine performance."
2,Unmemorable.,"So Shyamalan and Willis got together, made ""The Sixth Sense,"" one of the most moving films ever, and as this movie might say, ""we gave them our credit card number,"" showing up in droves for ""Unbreakable"" on opening weekend. We remained glued to the screen for the first hour, despite the overuse of slow-motion and the minimal dialogue, because these guys did ""The Sixth Sense,"" and waiting that one out paid off, right? And ""Unbreakable"" also foreshadows a big surprise. But it's not that big and not that surprising. You don't need to bring any hankies to this movie. Bring several enemies instead, thereby wasting their time."
2,SHYAMALAN LOST A FEW SENSES MAKING UNBREAKABLE,"""Unbreakable"" is fair. You see Bruce Willis' paycheck is huge, so cut out train accident sequence and just show a news junket of a crashed train.Furthermore the sets are so dark you wonder why people are living in such depressed surroundings. The plot itself is interesting and kept me watching, but as the movie progressed it got dumber and dumber.Shyamalan shows up in the movie for a cameo (Does he think he is the next Hitchcock?)....Not on my life.The characters never evolve, you never understand the relationship between Willis' character and his son, or his wife.Other dead ends are with Samuel L. Jackson character who is nuts, but you wonder how he found Willis' and how he knew he had this special gift.The movie is just digestible fare not worth a movie ticket admission, but okay for rental.With ""The Sixth Sense"" the kid could see dead people, with ""Unbreakable"" Willis could see crazy people....stupid."
5,Great Film!,"This was my favorite movie that year. It kept me in its grips until the end.It's ironic that if this movie had not been made, that great show on tv, ""Heroes"" would not exist. I strongly believe Unbreakable to be the blueprint for Heroes.It's the question, do superheroes exist? Not in the traditional sense of course.Buy this, or rent it, and WATCH IT!This is my favorite M. Knight film."
3,It was just ok,"This film had a good plot line and great acting from Willis and Jackson, and I like it, but it just pales in comparison with The Sixth Sense and Signs, Shyamalan's masterpieces. The critics shouldn't have slammed it like they did. It wasn't that bad. The ending was kind of abrupt, though."
1,About that Poncho!!!,"Was this a comedy ? While watching someone, face unseen, skulking about in a poncho on some heroic(?) mission, we wondered if Bruce had abandoned the film entirely due to embarassment and boredom! And about that dialogue...""Stop, you're not supposed to shoot your father!"" How idiotic and where was the much needed psychiatric care for the boy? This movie was a joke and complete waste of time."
2,As enticing as a bus-ride!,"Despite my usual verbosity, this time I'll be short: what a boring and disappointing movie! The plot is turtle-paced and I've caught myself on acute desire to give the characters a good push in the back so that they act and speak faster. B Willis is somnambular and S Jackson should get a better haircut and change his shining violet raincoat for something less awkward looking. The viewer feels fooled in the end by rather an ordinary movie-trick.It's worth to watch it only to compare it with the over-hyped ""6th Sense"". Maybe I'm too harsh, but I consider it lost money."
1,Worst...Movie...Ever,"This movie [stunk]. I thought it had some promise when I was told it was about a guy that survives a train wreck, but the promising concept was ruined by the strange comic hero idea. I wouldn't recommend even spending three bucks to rent this, let alone the twenty some to buy it. Go get something good instead."
1,This movie sucks,"I watched this in the movie theater and boy was it boring. If this was a thriller, I wasn't thrilled. This is the type of movie you'd show your kids if you wanted them to sleep because it starts of slow and the ending isn't worth waiting for. This is almost like Blairwitch project where they build up the hype and the product ain't tight. I recommend you skip this and buy yourself a homestyle melt in Burger king, its much better."
1,What A Disappointment,"I love ""Sixth Sense"" and fully anticipated loving this film as well. What an unbelievably disappointing experience. I kept waiting for something even remotely interesting or believable, interesting or meaningful to happen, and got to the end with my mouth hanging open in disbelief in the waste of time and money spent. What a piece of nothing. Not even remotely interesting. Bruce Willis and company should, however, be given an award--the Razzy perhaps--for their ability to maintain not only straight faces, but utterly grim and emotionless faces. Don't waste your time. If I could give it less than 1 star, which Amazon doesn't allow, I'd give it a .001 for Willis' lack of emotional depth."
1,Unbareably Boring,"First thing first, I saw the Sixth Sense and found that it was ruined by good reviews and over hyped and the much talked about twist end which was predictable, after that I desided not to read a thing on Unbreakable. That didn't help one bit. While The Sixth Sense wasn't much great I liked the idea it had and it had some good moments, at least it managed to keep me interested for awhile, Unbreakable lost my intrest around 5 minutes into the movie, thirty minutes later I was almost asleep, I wish I could of fallen asleep for this movie went no where FAST. The plot was the same thing re hashed over and over again, Jackson keeps trying the prswade Willis that he is a super hero but Wissis doesn't listen, that is basily what the whole movie is like, there is actully no point in seeing this film at for it is just far to boring, I highly recommend that you skip this one."
2,"Weak, dissapointing","This is probably my least favorite M Night film (I have not seen Lady in the Water). Sure, it has an interesting premise, but it just doesn't go anywhere. It barely has any kind of suspense or intrigue after the first 20 minutes. The characters are barely interesting, though I do have to give props to Sam Jackson for giving an effectivly creepy and on pitch performance. Bruce Willis sleep walks through the film, as usual. All in all, rather dissapointing."
3,"Not one of M. Night's better movies, but not bad","I was a little disappointed in this film. Not as good as Signs or Sixth Sense, but worth watching at least once."
2,Interesting Premise But,"It's just too slow and lugubrious. All the scenes are dark and depressing. I felt like asking someone to turn on the lights! Fine acting, cinematography and all that, but I'm really not a big fan of comic books, and especially not of movies made about comic books. If I had known that this movie was a comic book story I would have never rented it. If you like comic books, you'll probably love it."
2,Unbearable more like it,"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of the great Samuel L Jackson. I'm probably the only person that found myself asking why was this made? Mr. Glass was the only thing keeping me in the theatre, and I work there!!! I have no intention on buying this DVD. I'm mainly writing this review to see if anyone shares my opinion about this movie. Leave the comic book scene to Kevin Smith."
2,Not a very good movie,"IMHO, this movie will be great if it is 45 mins shorter. They run out of idea half way through and start repeating the same idea over and over.The ending is not very good or ""deep"" either.Skip it"
2,waste of money,Since this movie stars Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson I thought it would be good. It was so boring I couldn't wait for it to end. Everybody in the movie speaks in a hushed monotone and it's hard to hear what they're saying. It's probably just as well because the plot is ridiculous and far fetched. Bruce Willis' character cannot be injured in accidents where everyone else is killed. Samuel Jackson is his opposite who breaks bones just by sneezing. Samuel Jackson has a theory that characters in comic books are real and are on earth and represent good and evil. This is actually the theme of the movie the best I could tell. None of the characters in the movie are likeable and I really wasn't interested in what happened to them. I hope they don't make a sequel.
2,Unwatchable,"Sadly, this film did not live up to those high expectations. I found THE SIXTH SENSE to be one of the best films for ages, but this is a lame follow up. I like Samuel L. Jackson films normally, and he is good in this, but it isn't one of his better films. I almost fell asleep watching this as the pacing is so slow and character development is scarce. It becomes un-interesting and far fetched, as for the twist, well, its not too bad, but nothing surprising. I was hoping this was going to be a brilliant movie experiance, my advice is not to keep your hopes up, because, unlike the film, they will be breakable."
5,So Underrated,"WHY DID THE CRITICS SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS FILM... and they go on saying TRAFFIC is a awesome movie... it's good, buttt not the best film to watch... Now if want to see a great movie, watch this stuff.. when I was going to watch this movie for the first time, I thought it was going to be terrible, but it was so awesome... Samuel should stick to these movie then FORMULA 51??? (shill in disgust!!)... Bruce Willis is awesome in here as well... one of the best and most underrated films in 2000!"
3,Do you like comics?,"This movie makes a strong statement on how our ""modern mythology"" (comic books) comes from actual historic events, and that people with superpowers live among us.The movie is constructed very carefully, building at a very measured pace. If you are looking for some kind of action-based climax, you will be disappointed as there is none (but always feels like it is building up to one). If you are into comic books, superheroes, or the like, then this will be a wonderful movie for you.I unfortunately have not had the background of someone that would enjoy this movie; I could see a very strong statement being built, but it looked to me like it was built nowhere and afterwards came crashing down; I wondered afterwards why I watched it. I did not enjoy it, but I can see that others might. Rent this tape with care."
4,Held up pretty well.,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film at the theater when I was kid and it scared the hell out me (in a good way) and I couldn't wait to see it. I felt the same way again when I found it on Amazon. This moody, psychological thriller still holds up pretty well today."
2,Highschool Rolling Music,"First off, I will say it does take alot to impress me when it comes to trance. I hate anything having to do with Ibiza, jokenfold, and most mainstream trance. With that caveat out of the way, I will say this album does start off strong, but then quickly degenerates into fluffy ""first time doing E in highschool"" trance, almost right up there with the cheese to be found in Ministry of Sound. (might as well mix in some rainbow bright and carebears) The only actual psy elements I heard didn't really kick in until towards the end of the album, when it starts to pick up a little. This album would be great for mixing, but really can't stand very well on its own. If you are at the point where you've found Juno Reactor, Shpongle, Infected Mushroom, Hallucinogen, you probably won't be impressed with this. Its just too standard, not nearly tripped out enough."
1,Just cheap plastic combs with shapr unpolished teeth.,"Just cheap plastic combs. The teeth are not polished and will unpleasantly sharp on most folks' scalps. If you buy an Ace comb, be sure to run it over a fine emory board a few times to take the pin-points of the teeth. The conair combs, in this regard, are a superior product.Unfortunately, Ace no longer manufactures the hard rubber UNBREAKABLE COMB. The Ace brand belongs now to Goody Products, Inc., which, in turn is part of Newell Rubbermaid. Goody produces plastic hair combs and brushes. Go to any store and you can find cheap plastic combs as good as these. Goody actually makes better combs under it's Goody brand than these it makes under the ACE brand."
1,Disappointed,The comb is plastic and not hard rubber like advertised. Could have bought a plastic comb for less money but wanted rubber. Would not deal with this vendor again.
4,Great comb.....but,"I have used this comb for decades. The perfect comb with the exception they are no longer truly ""hard rubber"", at least not like they used to be. Ends always break which is frustrating but it is still my desired comb. You just have to know if you carry it in your back pocket, the ends are gonna break!"
5,cd,I really like rem. My husband listened to them first then I started to like them. This is probably my favorite cd from them.
4,I have a lot of experience using the ...,"I have a lot of experience using the Always brand -- they're my preferred brand of feminine hygiene product. I liked these pads, but I mistakenly thought they were going to be thicker. These are much like a panty liner, so I wasn't able to use them a lot. These pads are best suited for women with lighter menstrual periods, and they serve well as a panty liner. I could've used this same type pad during my pregnancy two years ago, especially during the last couple of months when my daughter was pressing on my bladder, causing some embarrassing leakage at times. These would also be good for post-pregnancy, to catch any light bleeding. As usual with Always products, I loved the dry-weave that keeps the top layer dry, and the wings that help secure the pad to underwear. All in all, a very good product."
4,What I love about this product is that ...,What I love about this product is that it was soooo thin. It absorbed really well and it wasn't bulky. It covered the areas that REALLY needed to be covered without making me feel that the whole world knew I was wearing it.
5,Last Word on Miami Mid-Century Modern,I wish my dad were still alive he would be thrilled by this book. Like all rich Cuban kids my grandfather brought the family to Miami Beach a few times a year for shopping and business and loved the architecture of Miami of this time. ( They were at the Carillon Hotel on Miami Beach when the Batista regime collapsed New Years Eve (1958 -59 ) There has been such hoopla to preserve Miami Beach's Art Deco building while many of the mid century modern masterpieces are being torn down or in the case of the Carillon Hotel mutilated beyond recognition. This book is a must of any lover of Miami and it's history.
5,Exactly what I expected!!,"As an architecture student in Miami, I absolutely love this book. It's extremely useful to help understand some of the SoBe culture and architectural history. A great reference!"
2,"Tried to Like It, I Really Did","Less weighty than I had hoped, and because of its chatty style much more difficult to read than I had hoped (don't people employ editors any more?) But the ideas are interesting and engagingly presented.This could have been a really good book."
1,THIS BOOK STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN!,"Save your money! This is one of the worst books ever written! Trust me, this is one horrid book! Amazon doesn't normally allow you to get a refund simply because you don't like the way a book was written but I threatened never to buy another product from them if they didn't. Fortunately they capitulated. This book is an exercise in gross self-indulgence and unprofessionalism. It's not only that it's illegible, but it's loaded with postage stamp sized pictures (literally) that are tinted red, blue, green, yellow....etc. It's as if a child pasted a disparate bunch of pictures in a notebook and made an attempt at writing prose. Money is too tight to waste on this. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
3,"Nice pictures, not a lot of instructions","Nice book, but the author does not go into a lot of construction details. There arent many projects either. The book seems like an excuse to show pretty furniture pictures.If you like country furniture, try ""Country Pine"" from Bill Hylton instead. Much more projects than this one and more construction hints and tips."
4,Good film - but don't let the name fool you,"The maker's description of the film gives the wrong impression. The house rented out for a party is only a small part of the plot. It's mostly about journalists struggling against the restricitons set on them by the Islamic Republic of Iran. It's dark - but very good. Though really a minor part of the film, the party scene gives one a glimpse into the life of real young Iranians. The images of veiled women and gun-toting bearded men so prominent in Western media are here completely contradicted by scenes of young women in revealing party clothes and young men break-dancing to western music."
1,sailing shoes,it was sent fast but the cd case was broken and there were numerous skips i am in the process of trying to return it
5,Sailin'shoes...,"Little Feat have been a long,long time fave of mine! The price was awesome,the disc came rather quickly,in great shape! aweome!!"
5,Why wasn't this a hit?,"Ted Templeman produced two albums in 1972 of note: ""Toulouse Street,"" by the Doobie Brothers, and ""Sailin' Shoes"" by Little Feat. As you probably know, ""Toulouse Street"" made the Doobies famous. The fact that this album went ignored amazes me to this day.It's a cliche, but there simply isn't a bad song here. From the opening organ of ""Easy toSlip,"" you're hooked. The album rocks up a storm and blows down the house. ""Tripe Face Boogie"" makes you wanna get up and dance with the neighbors. ""Trouble"" is one of Lowell George's stranger and wittier works, and the remake of ""Willin'"" is why everybody knows this song 30 years later.If you're not a musician, this is why every musician worth his or her muster in the 70s bowed down to these guys. Check it out."
5,one of da best,"i believe bobby v is one of da best singers out right now, i can bump that cd all the way through. the most underrated cd of 05."
2,Bobby 'Basic' Valentino,"Ever heard the term 'Generic RnB'... well now you have. This album is about as basic as RnB can get. The only song on this album worth getting happy about is slow down, and that is only due to its unique sound. However on listening to the rest of this album i found that the 'unique' sound of slow down was dragged into every song.Every time i skipped to the next track i found that the distinctive base from slow down was present, in the end i began to think that maybe JLO worked with Bobby on this album as she also has the tendancy to use dodgy sounds in her music (mainly high pitched squeeky sounds... as heard in Jenny from the block and Get Right)."
5,Re: Chance Well Deserved,"I'm liking this young brother. He comes off in one setting of Jodeci and in another setting of the great ""New Edition"". The track, ""Tell Me"" is one of favorites and stands out as a happening tune. I agree with the reviewer who said that many of his tracks are similar in production. But since Tim Kelley provided the velvety sounds of harps and mood base, this sound acts as a signature to Bobby Valentino. This is a good album."
1,Worst R&B Album of the Year!!!!!,"This CD was the most stupid one I've heard all year. The beats are all the same, and the lyrics are horrible. He screams out ""put a ring on your finger"" during a line wit no rhyme to it. He needs to hire a better writer so ""don't turn around,"" isn't in another one of his album's."
4,pretty good,it's pretty good for a starter. you just have to listen to the songs and the words. the only draw back is that some of the beats sound the same.favorite songssome bobbyslow downgive me a chancetell memy angelwant to know megangsta lovecome touch meone girl to love
2,just ok,"the production is cool,but the lyrics&overall presentation are just kinda there.the first cut was decent but Bobby Valentino is missing depth as a Vocalist.there are a couple aight cuts but the rest is alot of filler."
4,cool,i got this cd the very first day it came out. i heard some songs on this cd and i must say that most of them are decent and bobby valentino sings very well. so go get this cd you will be impressed.
2,DESAPOINTED,"I really like the song slow down (except the stupid lyrics in the hook: don't turn around... oh wait yes turn around ...:( )But the rest of the album is really boring, nothing original, same old melodies, he got a nice voice but it s very generic, I couldn't tell him apart from any other RnB singer right away (Anthony Hamilton I could !!!!)Some of the beats are good but they sound too similair 2 eachother whcih is what happen when you get the same producers to create many tracks on an album. Tell me has a great beat but what he did on it is less then good, stilling Ginuwine's lyrics and concept (in these jeans) and flowing with boring melodies again. I really only like track 2 and 6. The rest is boring, similar and sounds like RnB from the 90s"
1,I would give it zero stars if possible.,"Bobby Valentino is the most boring artist ever. He sucks. My friend bought this cd and began to cry after listening to it cuz she really needed the 15 bucks to buy a book for school but instead WASTED it on this crap. So yeah, like I was saying his voice is no big shocker. He doesnt bring anything new to the table, very average everything. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. We already have Usher and umm the guy can really dance and Bobby cant. Please ladies, save your money and buy some make-up instead. Ludacris is only trying to make money for his DTP label."
2,Valentino? I don't Think So,"Bobby Valentino? This dude wants to be Italian or something! Taking an Italian last name like Valentino is not cool when your not even Italian and this guy is obviously not Italian. The only good songs are slow down and tell me. Oh, and the intro is good because Im a Bobby too so it's my theme song. Bobby Valentino...NO!!! If you want real R&B pick Justin Timberlakes's cd.~1~"
3,was1 the best singers half of 2005 than he disappear after that,bobby v was doing well releasing 2 very good to great music videos with amazing beats then after the summer he wasn't in no more music videos which is a shame i guess because he is probably short than luda but n his hits were larger than life i don't no which i liked better slow down or in those jeans with little wayne these two put him on the map as a r and b artist if bobby v doesn't try 2 make another hit soon he will be a 2 hit wonder despite having a successful album he and other artists TI did to prove to their fans why their album are so successful by giving millions the image from their hits in their album i look at their album as as owner to a house it is up to the owner to invite the fans in or out to see what they house is all about the artists' videos are their decorations that explains their personality if the artists doesn't let the viewers into their house it will remain unanswer forever
2,SUCKS,"This album is so bland or boring. My cousin left her album over my house and I decided to listen to it. Man I skipped every song on the album. I cant believe people actually would spend money on this, what a waste. The dude constant whining gave me a headache. His music has no depth or passion."
3,The beats keeps this album going...,"I am not a Bobby Valentino fan. Sorry people, I'm not... but after I heard three tracks off this album, I felt compelled to cop this. Firstly, Mista Valentino has such nerve; he is not at all a ""fabulous"" singer, not at all an eloquent or even that much of an intelligent writer/singer, but he certainly is determined - gotta give the man credit for that. However, I have to say the producer gets five stars across the board. The beats are so important to this album - it makes the melodies and that is where Bobby Valentino's album is most successful.Gotta say that the best tracks are as follows:Slow DownTell MeGive Me a ChanceLove DreamI'll Forgive You (A bite, but nicely done)Want You to Know Me (sounds like this song should have been for Jagged Edge)Come Touch MeThat's my story and I'm sticking to it. -m"
4,I really need some Bobby,"Bobby Valentino has that cool classic R & B voice. Like someone else said he's on the Jodeci vide, I miss them with the greatest slow jams. All of the songs on this album are pretty laid back, so get mellow with Bobby V. I hope he is working on his next album b/c we don't need another 1 hit wonder."
4,great start- hopefully not last album,"i was anticipating this cd since bobby used to sing in the group mista. i like his cd and he gets props that he wrote or co-wrote like every song on the cd. i like the whole cd be some songs i dig are ""angel"", ""gangsta love"", "" one girl to love"" and ""slow down remix""."
2,Everybody Don't Need No Bobby,"Please his music is so watered down that if listen to this album to long I would drown. I respect Bobby for trying to reinvent R&B music but thats what he's doing, trying. The music on here isn't terrible but it's so bland it's not even funny. His voice is average and whiney just like alot of these washed up R&B artists such as Mario, Omarion & the list goes on. This is one of the reasons why I can't get into R&B music nowadays because it sounds so corny. Bobby Valentino is indeed above his counterparts who are just embarrassing like that generic boy band Pretty Ricky. I think it's time we get some real R&B katz in the game."
2,You ain't slick...,"Bobby's last name is not Valentino...it's WILSON! I have the MISTA CD. But ANYWAY, the CD is OK. Alot of the songs sound the same."
3,I WAS WAITIN' 4 MO',"THE PRODUCTION IS TOO THE SAME!! BOBBY SHOULD HAVE WORKED WITH SOME DIFFERENT PRODUCERS,CAUSE HE GOT THE VOICE 2 SING,BUT THE WHOLE ALBUM SOUNDS THE SAME!!"
5,I LOVE HIM!,He is so fine and I just love his voice. He is the sexiest thing and I am in love with this CD. I definatly recommend it to all those R&B lovers out there.
2,"Mundane album, boring at best.","The first song that lasts like 45 seconds is one of the best on the whole CD I just kept listening to this intro, because i had wished this album sounded something like the intro, but it didnt. The following 13 tracks mostly sounded the same- boring and mundane save for one or two singles that had a faster beat than the slow slumberring ballads. Other reviewers are right when they say his album is nasty, IT IS, for no real reason. R. Kelly does nasty right with a beat and some great lyrics. Get OMARIONs CD instead, they sound the same, but Omarion has better producers and writers and he can actully sing and its not all about sex."
4,Album for any occassion...,"I didn't know what to think about this CD at first because I wasn't really feelin 'slow down' at first but it grew on me and I used to play it all day everyday. Now i play the whole CD all day everyday. Like I said it's a album for any occassion: if you chillin with your man/girl, if you mad at your man/girl, if you bout to go find you a man/girl, its a song on here for it"
4,It's pretty good.,"as usual, like any r and b singer, we have dirty filthy disgusting sexual lyrics, so that really takes away from the thing as a whole, but the beats just sound good to me so I like it. His voice sounds just the same as the singer from Pretty Ricky so it's hard to tell the difference. And by the way his name's Bobby Wilson, not Bobby Valentino. He just wants to sound like he's real romantic, I guess. All he talks about is (darn) sex and it gets so irritating. Makes me wonder if he thinks about anything important or meaningful. This is the kinda stuff a woman would sing abou,t all they think about is sex anyway. It's the same with guys too, but it's just so frustrating 'cause it a;ll they talk bout., i get annoyed bi it. I like the beats, so that's a plus, but I wish he'd talk aout something usefil.Mike Morrison"
5,THE BEST,"I Love Bobby v cd,and i cant believe some of you all said it was boring it was very good.Its really ashame people are dissin my boy.He's young,sexy,and most important sucessful.SO PLEASE STOP HATIN'!"
3,Not Quite There Yet,I don't really like this CD personally. It has some cuts on it though that are hot. Tell Me has a banging track an it would make a good single. I'm really not feeling this cd like that. But I gave it 3 stars cuz it does have some nice beats an music on it. It's just some songs sound the same and repetitive. Tell Me sounds like Slow Down and GIve Me a Chance..I said I really Love you..emm it really sounds like someone else should be singing this..Like Maxwell ...The Ballads are kinda wack too..ugh im not even sure i should be giving this 3 stars..Hey maybe it will grow on me
1,Bland,"What is up with these new male R&B; singers with nothing to offer? Mediocre voices, boring beats and nothing new to say! BORING! Yea, I like the song ""Slow Down"" and that's why I bought this CD. What a waste! There is not another song on here that has any kind of substance to it. I am skimming through the CD now as I write this trying to pick another ""good"" song to mention and there is NOTHING! The sad part is there is like 50 songs on this CD and 1 is ""ok"" and the rest are just bad!Don't bother!"
4,A fun read.,"I picked this book at the recommendation of a friend, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It takes place in Charleston, WV (which completely thrills me, because I grew up in WV) and involves a strange mix of multiple personalities, serial killers, life after death, and shop lifters. Lukac's writing is clear, and the themes and ideas introduced in this novel are incredibly intriguing. I can't wait to pick up Oogie Boogie Bounce, which I've heard is even better than this book.My only complaint of the book as a whole is the character Philip Ducalion. He is a very important character - I won't say why because I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who hasn't read it. I just felt as if he was developed enough. He wasn't introduced until later in the book, and then I wasn't sure why he was introduced. It was all very unclear to me, and still is even though I've finished the book."
1,Absolutely unbelievable!,"It indicates on the DVD's case that this film has been digitally transferred. One would then expect that the film would present a crystal-clear image with vibrant colors. Well, expect again - this DVD is a piece of crap!The colors are washed-out, the images are fuzzy, and the aspect ratio is all wrong! Automobiles look like they are three feet long and six feet tall! The gorgeous Erika Blanc is made to look as though she is twelve feet tall and suffering from terminal anorexia nervosa. The DVD is watchable with effort, but keep aspirin nearby in case you get a headache from focusing on the distorted images.If you get a chance to see a good print of the famous Italian mystery from the 1970s, please do so - you will enjoy it. However, leave this edition alone!"
1,one of the worst looking dvd's i've ever seen!!,"i was sooo looking forward to purchasing this title as it is one of my faves,but be WARNED-one of the worst ""transfers"" i have ever sat thru!uneven colors,improper framing,grain on top of more grain,you get the picture...i would suggest waiting for a (hopefully)better release,or buy it used.you have been warned..."
2,Movie summary / Review,"I got the movie as part of The Living Dead collection, so this is a rating only for the movie, not the DVD.It pretty much sucks."
3,the night evelyn came out of the grave,an old type movie in the classic b style.....has some good effects and story line
5,"It is cultural cannibalism, but its sublime","What right has David Byrne to slog through other cultures, vacuuming up ""authentic"" music? Every right, when the music is as good as this.Make no mistake, this isn't ""Latin"" music, this is ""David Byrne does Latin music"". The beats, the players etc are all real enough, but whether you like it or hate it will be because of Byrne's distinctively edgey aesthetic . . .For better and more authentic musicianship of similar material, you could turn to Jesus Alemany's ""Cubanismo"" and ""Malembe"", but that's a different thing. . .what is glorious about Rei Momo is Byrne- you either accept his right to fuse traditional latin music into his post-punk funky nihilism, or you don't.NB: If you like Byrne in this mode, you would also like his recording of ""The Rivers of March"", recorded with Marisa Monte . . .a great take on a classic, recorded on Red, Hot and Blue (I think that's correct)"
5,Your chocolate in my peanut butter!,"To those who think that this CD isn't respectful of South American music, try to remember your history. It isn't as if the merengue didn't exist one day, and the next day it did exist. South American and Caribbean music owe much to Los Esclavos who brought their African rhythms with them to the ""New"" world. To turn around and criticize David Bryne for borrowing, or bending musical ideas as he sees fit is hypocritical at best, possibly racist. This fusion of post-modern North American narrative over South American rhythms just plain WORKS. These songs are beautiful. Interestingly, I know a great local latin percussionist who agrees with me about this album. Try it if your brain isn't rusted shut."
4,Not what I expected.,I love Enya's music. So I thought I would like to play it on my keyboard. The problem is that on some of Amazon's books it says look inside this book. I do wish they would let you look at maybe one page to see if it is at the playing level that you are at. I know it says easy piano but there are people who produce different easy piano books for instance Dan Coats is easier than this book.
1,Am I playing the same game as you guys?,"I rented this game on ps2 because I don't have a 360. I've played the 360 version and it was fun. however, the only thing the ps2 version has in common with the 360 version is the name. nothing else. The missions are different, the graphics have been toned down massively, the AI is choppy, and one of the worst things about this game is that the cover system is terrible! when I take cover behind a wall and try to peak around, it doesn't even let me look past the wall. It's hard to explain, but once you take cover and try to peak around corners, you'll understand what I mean. You can't change from 1st to 3rd person. There are a limited number of orders you can give your teammates. There are much more bad qualities this game has that I won't mention you'll have to see for yourself. bottom line, if you own a 360 buy that version. if you don't, ignore this game and stick to the previous ghost recon games"
3,Not Great!,"I've been playing Tom Clancy games since Splinter Cell and Rainbow Six... if only this game were as good. As far as the upsides, the missions are well planned, the gameplay is pretty solid, and the voice acting and prerenderd cutscenes are nice. The downsides... the in game graphics look like something from the later years of the N64, the sound is tacky, and the physics are horrible! You shoot a dude, and he hits the ground like he's already stiff, (sometimes they even fall off of balconies and SIT IN THE AIR!!) Totally stupid stuff.Overall, not horrible, but not good either."
4,My Brother loves it,The game has great graphics. My brother loves it because it was a challenge and tested his mind. Would recommend and I don't really like video games like this. This game is an exception.
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOO,"Uhhh No....., i agree w/ u. this game [...]! o sure its fun to shoot people but the whole communicating with your squad can get annoying. i would rather mind my own buisness and go my own ways w/o worrying about where he goes or who he shoots. also, there are too many things on the screen that are blocking the gameplay. and no jump button. and, no aim button. wow. kinda pathetic. if you want some real war games, try these:Call of Duty: Finest HourCall of Duty 2: Big Red OneMedal of Honor: FrontlineThese i enjoyed and were worth my time unlike Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter"
4,Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter PS2,"When you think of Ghost Recon or even Tom Clancy video games you think of ""STEALTH"" missions, well this game doesn't have much stealth at all. With the ""ABILITY TO SWITCH"" between stealth and just full on ""ATTACK"" it isn't really stealth at all, your partner in most missions just stands around waiting for your orders, but if you choose ""ATTACK"" mode than your partner just does most the work and that isn't fun unless you are a ""lazy bum"" and like doing just about nothing. Plus this game doesn't even have ""TWO PLAYER"" game play although it has online play it still is a bunch of ""BULL""!!!!!!!!! Overall I rate the fun of this game a 3 and the game overall a 4.5. So this game might be a good buy. Written by: jaja D."
4,Good game once you get past the graphics.,"I just rented the game today and I'm hooked on it. I have Ghost Recon Jungle and that brought me into the games. I read most of the peoples reviews, but rented it anyway. I began to play and yes the enemy soldiers do indeed skip frames, just as the other games did, but I got over that pretty fast. In some cases it takes awhile to take down an enemy soldier, which kind of stinks, but all in all the game play so far has worked to my advantege. Also the game dosn't have very bad graphics, and their better than the past few Ghost Recon games. I'm not saying the graphics are amazing, i'm just saying that they work, if you know what I mean. It's a fun game, and so far i've enjoying every bit of it."
3,"Ghost Recon "" Advanced Warfighter "" ps2",I ordered Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter for my kid on ps2. Received the box for Advanced Warfighter but received the orgional Ghost Recon!!! Wasn't aware of this until this weekend when my son went to trade this game in at Play and trade!!!
5,Keebler onion toasteds,SOOO glad we can find these on Amazon. Stores around here don't/won't stock them and they are my husbands favorite.
5,"Do not Passover,Spitiruality at Passover","Do not shy away from this becasue you are not ""religious"" enough!! This Haggudah provides insights into the meaning of Passover, with stories and naratives that add a richness and a freshness to a familiar story, one might think they know by heart. It is to the heart, it is written, and evey reader will be personally touched in a unique way!"
4,"New ideas for the ""ghosts""","I really found this book to be helpful in arranging for a very ""scary"" Halloween party. I throw a big kiids party every year and some of the ideas seem tired. but this book gave me some very helpful and new tips. A must have for every crafter and party planner."
4,Some Cute and Clever Ideas...If you have children,"Over-all I'd have to say this was a pretty good book if you are looking for some cute and clever ideas for decorating, costumes, and crafts for children. The book is beautifully photographed and illustrated, and the step-by-step instructions are clear and concise. However, if you are looking for good Halloween decorating and party ideas that are a lot more elegant and adult-oriented, then I strongly recommend the Kasey Rogers (Louise Tate, from Bewitched) book: ""Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Decor."" It is well worth the money, or else try Martha Stewart's Halloween book. It is basically a compilation of several years' worth of her Halloween recipes, decorating, and costume ideas from the October issues of her magazine: ""Martha Stewart Living."" Both of these books have decorating and party ideas that are a lot more oriented for those of us adults who still enjoy having fun on Halloween, while not being ""cutesy"" nor overly gorey, either."
1,Still waiting for the fun,"If the book wasn't *way* too cute for my taste, I'd still dislike it. Some of the food ideas are scary, but not in a good way. The projects are familiar -- probably because I've seen them in at least two other places. I can't recommend this at all."
4,"Lagos, what an interesting place...","If you're a fan of Koolhas or themes related to population growth, urban environments & developing countries, you should pick this up. It can be a little heady & dense at times. The format of the dvd cuts back and forth from Koolhas engaged in a panel discussion interspersed with scenes of Lagos, including minimal interviews from those native to the city. I started watching and had to put it down because my head was full. Watch with objectivity, although Koolhaas' views are intriguing and persuasive they may not be the total answer.Nonetheless a great educational supplement on a wide range of themes."
5,Astonishing,"Amazing, astonishing, unbeleivable documentary. Great film about work, life, urbanism, trafic in Lagos, so far away from us, almost a different planet."
5,Exceptional Resource for all Levels of Trainers & Participants,"I had a client ask for customized workshop on customer service and after researching the subject for weeks, looking through many resources and plenty of books related to customer service (and mostly sales), I found this one. It was perfect. Maxine Kamin took all of the concepts that the other books I read touched on and effectively distilled them down into understandable and usable pieces that are practical for any level of trainer, any level of workshop participant and flexible enough to build a program of any length, depending on client need. This book will help you take an otherwise pedestrian subject and make it interesting for your participants."
4,Masterpieces,"Robert Schumann composed at the height of the Romance era, and his list of works are long and varied. Some of his most famous are his four symphonies, which are short enough in length and similar enough in style that they are often featured together in a set. This is one of those sets. The orchestration in this set is good, and the sound quality is great. The only drawback is some of the pieces are not performed as dramatically as in other albums. Still, this is a great buy for the cost and all four symphonies make for great listening."
3,Great Music That Is Played Too Lightweight,"I have to go with the minority opinion on this one. I honesty have a hard time appreciating Early Romantic Music which is true. I have an even harder time appreciating Schumann in this case played like Mozart's ""Haffner"" symphony four times over. The one reviewer was right on that said the playing lacked grandeur and sweep. Schumann was a full blown manic-depressive and the extremes in mood should be expressed. Instead the music is too light-hearted and lilting without digging down to the depths of emotional tumult. Giving this set three stars is the benefit of the doubt that I am wrong for I feel like giving it one star. Zinman, however, does play the notes correctly and gets the effect that he wants...I guess. This is something different, but not my cup of tea. I will probably be wanting to sell this soon."
2,Strange Collection,"I bought this because Zinman and the Tonhalle Orchestra are my favorites. So what did I get. Each of the two diskswere labelled ""Symphony 1"" and ""Symphony 2"". One of the cds was actually Zinman, Tonhalle, and Symphonies 1 & 2.The other cd (same label) was Symphonies 3 & 4, but not Zinman; it was someone else, maybe Bernstein."
3,"Not the best , Bill","I love the Nameless Detective series. Started with a copy of Shackles,years back, loved it, found the first novel Snatch, and have read every single novel up to/through Spook (Nightcrawlers will be found and started soon.)This is not prime Namesless. Pronini has semi-retired his Nameless Detective, bought in a new Op and tries to do a three part running narrative (with Bill, Jake and Tamara). Very poor decision, Pronzini. The strong single person narrative of Nameless, was the strength of the other novels; to ""split off"" the action and have Bill (aka Author) sitting in the narartive background to me was a major disppointment.I'll read Nightcrawlers next. But Bill, as in Bill Pronzini, don't do the split chapter narrative again, and if you must, two people mazimum. Nameless is a great character, if he wants Jake to take over, let him. But no more Nameless as Consultant; doesn't work for me."
3,Somewhat distracting,"This book contains a very nice plot, leading up to an excellent ending. My only criticizm is that now and then he gets to moralizing, almost preaching, - do not believe that has a place in the middle of a murder mystery."
3,take some oboe lessons!,"I have only head the piece ""Oboe Blues"" so far, but right now I want to go ram a sharp stick in my ear. While techinically proficient on the oboe, he has no concept of a good tone. His tone is comparable to a 6th grader playing on a plastic instrument with a plastic reed. It would probably be a wonderful piece if it was being played by someone who really knew how to play the oboe."
3,Arrived with a small crack,"This set is a cute little clay set, not plastic. But I'm not too impressed with the manufacturer. When the tea set arrived, without even opening the box, I could see through the clear window of the package that the handle of the little blue tea cup was cracked halfway through. It probably happened during the firing process and was later glazed over. But it is still an obvious crack and a weak spot that will probably be the first thing to break at the first tap on a table surface. It was an obvious defect that should have eliminated this cup from being included in a tea set and sold to a customer. I'm considering sending the set back...but I'm worried about the hassle of returns."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking for a reasonably sturdy tea set that could be used with acutal tea. Unfortunately, the lid to the tea pot doesn't fit which makes pouring tea rather difficult and messy. Not ideal for a little girl who desperately wants to feel bigger."
5,Perfect tea set for children's tea party!,My granddaughter used this tea set for her Birthday Party tea party. She is 4 years old and it was perfect.
2,Too Small,"The tea set is cute and I like the colors because they are gender neutral. My son loves to cook and he knows I like tea. Since he likes to pretend to make tea for me so I thought this would be a great gift. However, when it arrived I realized it is TINY. It seems like a tea set for toy dolls. I'm still trying to decide if I should return it to get another larger one. I am really disappointed!"
3,cute but small,this is a cute tea set but small compare to most. My daughter is 6 and it was entirely too small for her
4,really small,"I bought this tea set for my daughter as one of her christmas presents. The set compose of 4 tea cup, 4 saucer, a tea pot, a sugar jug and a creamer jug. The tea set color is just like the picture, a pastel color scheme of blue, green, yellow and coral. I give it 4 stars because it is very tiny, the set is more for pretend play then realistic play. Your child can't really put any thing to drink in the tea cup, but the saucer can hold a little mashmellow or m&m on it. If you are looking for a tea set for your child to drink and eat from, this not the tea set for you. I would recommend this tea set for a 2 or 3 year old child."
2,Small and Breaks easily,I bought this for my daughter who loves to play tea party. Every single piece broke or chipped within 2 months. I expected it to be small but these are REALLY SMALL! the cups are about an inch in diameter. Do not use for younger children as these break so easily that even when they clink cups together or place the cups on the plates a little to quickly sharp chunks fall off and kids could get cuts or worse.
3,love..... not so much love,"My daughter loves it and pretends to have tea parties all the time. She is three years old and can't get enough. I purchased it and can't believe how tiny the pieces are. They are hard for her to hold and only hold a few drops of ""tea"". I wish they were larger so i didn't have to run to the sink every two seconds and i could enjoy our time together."
5,Amazing and Transformative Tool,Hands down this is the best version of The I Ching available today. I am extremely grateful to have access to such a powerful and transformative tool! Thank you Carol and Hannah for your hard work!
2,Beware,"This text gives us a new way of throwing the I Ching to get much more specific answers. Problem is, one of the great strengths of the I Ching is that is stays on the mythic realm of archetype and imagistic poetry from which one interprets one's answer. Once you try to ground that into the specifics of the mundane, you get into trouble. I tried using their technique and wound up getting very frightening predictions of impending, fatal events that (now years later) I can say with confidence didn't happen. The beauty of the I Ching is that it offers us a poetic archetype of where we are, that we then interpret. The more you remove the poetry, and the interpretation, the more you remove the spirit of the original. I agree with previous reviewer who said, there's wisdom here, but it's not the I Ching."
2,great for fun and family not for business,I purchased the machine and was very excited to get it . I tried it out and it was a huge disapointment. The fonts could not be made smaller or larger and the scripted font didn't connect together - the letters had funky thread stitches between each letter - now for block letters I understand - they are not connected so it would have to have some way to keeps stitching but for the script it would be the right thing to have the letters just begin and end with the loopy lines that connect script letters in a word - but it didn't it was HORRIBLE looking. I am returning the machine ASAP because I can't use.It's probably really good for the novice who isn't really interested in sellin quality items. but I wouldn't recomend it to anyone who plans to use the decorative stitches or anything for a professial product. Not good quality for that.Good luck with your search.
5,Mony mae we hope to see,"This CD has it all: great songs, great playing, great singing. Expertly chosen Burns songs, played primarily on acoustic guitar and fiddle. Lovers of folk music and lied and Scots music and, well, any kind of music will love this one. I hope Andy M. Stewart records more Burns songs! First-class all the way."
2,Story of futility,"I did not like this book. The woman in the story endures self-imposed difficulties, with no final accomplishment. Very frustrating and annoying story. Only suggested for those highly interested in women's studies."
4,Great CD from a relatively unknown band.,"This album is still one of my favorites in my vast collection of music even after owning it since the fall of 2000, despite never really reaching national recognition or significant radio airplay. Stir is/was big around St. Louis, but not so much anywhere else. I became acclimated to Stir towards the end of college, and bought their CD on a whim. It paid off! Great, straightforward rock and roll that you can listen to over and over. I will agree, you probably won't find anything new here, but at least you'll know what you'll get if this is your genre of music. Standout tracks are ""New Beginning"", ""Climbing The Walls"", ""Stop Killing Me"", and ""Moon"". If you're skeptical from the online reviews, listen to the samples on this page, then decide for yourself."
4,Pretty good follow-up,"I can't say this compares to their first cd in the least, but at the same time there are alot of quality songs that any soft rock listener will be able to get into. Personal favorite from this cd are Clear, Spaceman, Velvet Elvis, Climbing The Walls, and New Beginning. The only reason I can't bring myself to give this a 5 star rating is because there's a few filler tracks that really aren't that good at all and it's slightly disappointing to hear a band perform such a great song and then you push the skip button and hear crap on the next song. Some GREAT songs, some decent, and a couple that should be forgotten forever.."
2,Not up to snuff,"This album is produced in a slick manner with hooks and it's obvious that the band has talent, it's just not shown in the songs. I believe that the band probably dumbed down the content to fit what they believe is more accessible stuff. It doesn't work. They are able to collaborate with the producer and create an interesting atmosphere on 'Spaceman' but other than that it's not that memorable because the songs aren't that deep, or resounding. 'Superstation' is the only song that could possibly make it onto the radio, but that's unlikely. ""Holy Dogs"" really disappointed me because I knew that this band had built up a grass roots following in their hometown on a cheap recording and this was their followup, unfortunately, it doesn't excell. Stir might have more honest and provoking music in their future, but based on this failure I don't know if they'll get a second chance."
2,The Music They Play Says Nothing To Me About My Life,"There seems to be a buzz about this group, so I thought let me check it out. I have an apprehension toward any band they are peddling as a next big thing. Make no mistake, this is another bland American band somewhere in the realm of Matchbox 20, Dave Matthews, Counting Crows and Tonic. I am no fan of hair metal, but I think if forced into a choice between listening to Warrant and this, I'd probably choose the latter. What happened to modern rock? Just because no one heard of this band yet doesn't make them good. But given most people's taste, it will probably sell about 10 million copies. Listen to real modern rock like Gay Dad, Belle and Sebastian, Promise Ring, VNV Nation or Suede. Terrible."

1,NO PAGE NUMBERS!,Warning...this version does not include page numbers as indicated in the description! Kindle support has no clue why either and won't help you! Do not purchase if you need page numbers for referencing.
2,Failed!,Two of the three batteries failed (1 DOA other after short use)They should test all outgoing batteries and prevent frustration
5,So far so good,"It arrived quickly, it fit perfectly into the phone, it was partly charged out of the box so that the phone came to life immediately, and over the next few hours it took a full charge. It's doing what it's supposed to do and the price was OK."
1,The Rabitt Died!!!!!!!!! -------BEWARE------,"This battery was either used and sold as new, or just plain JUNK! On my Motorola cordless phone, the original battery was only lasting 30-45 minutes on a charge so thought it was time to replace the battery. Within 3 months, THIS so called ""new"" battery would die in less that 1 minute!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS........To be fair, I filed a complaint with the Vendor through Amazon ( emtcom=seller). Never done that in my 62 years before. They had ignored my emails & complaints when contacted directly before. Now complaining through Amazon, they have emailed me that they are refunding my money. Since Amazon is directly involved, I think I can trust them to do so? Just not worth the hassle all around. Buyer beware."
1,This battery smokes!!!,"Bought this cheap replacement for my v-tech 20-2481 cordless phone. AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes. Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use. I opened cover to find a sizzling hole that burned thru the case of the cordless phone battery while in phone. I gave never seen this in my life and only imagine what if this happened while charging at home or just laying on table and caught house on fire. This is a cheap, generic, no name replacement cordless phone battery and buyer beware, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!! I am returning for a refund, I do not want to take a chance with another from them. I will go with a well known name one next time. DO NOT BUY"
3,Unsure of quality,"We put these in a 7-year old phone, and the phones got noisy. Don't really know if it was the age of the phone or the off-brand batteries. However, we soon bought a new phone system from Amazon; therefore, the money we spent on batteries was a loss."
3,"Not a perfect fit, but works fine","I have a 10 year old Vtech phone that I love. The battery stopped holding a charge so I purchased this as a replacement. The battery does work and my phone is back in business so I am happy, but what keeps this from being a 5-star review is the fit. The battery seems to be slightly fatter than the factory unit, so the battery cover in the phone doesn't quite fit right. I can force the cover on so it is serviceable but it looks like it wants to pop-off. Still it beats the heck out of a new phone and is working fine so I do recommend this product."
2,Too poor of film quality,"In this tape i have found that the picture looked very bad. It is obvious that the maker simply put a camera on the side of a fish take and filmed some fish on hopes of making a quick buck by selling. I would not recomend this tape to anyone looking for anything nice, but simply as a tape to buy if you just want to look at a fishtank"
1,DO NOT READ THIS THIS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILAR WITH THE SUBJECT,"This book is written assuming that you already know what went on, and fails to explain the details. I know that Carlyle was trying to re-invent the way we write history, but the book is practically unreadible."
1,Lost its main point way to fast,This book falls into the classification of most French Revolution books that I have read. It loses focus in the complexity of the revolution and gets bogged down in way to much detail. Even if you know a lot about the revolution the analysis is too much and distracts from whatever his overall point is which was lost by about page 20. I had a hard time getting through it and if I had not needed to read it for class I would have stopped after the first 50 pages. Try the French Revolution and the Ancien Regime by Collins for a much better look at the French Revolution.
1,The Definition of Turgid,"Whate Bede, William (1066), Shakespeare and Gibbons did for the English lexicon took 1000 years Fify years later Carlyle utterly decimates it in this innocuosly titled ""History"" book. Yes after several false starts I finished but it provided no more insight than reading a high school short history of... Don't read too much into those who praise this book as this is nothing more than proof of their erudition; a validation of such a high IQ. The 1982 Websters dicationary definge Turgid: bombastic style of literature to the point of complete obscuration of its intended meaning."
4,Feel the Balls,"The gameplay of this game is insufficient,But beautiful clarity.. No hang ups.. a game wit better view angle would help.."
4,There are less bugs in this game than Fifa 2004,"Ok this game might not be as popular as FIFA 2004 but it is actually better as it has more of the players actual faces added on the game like Bixente Lizarazu, Marcus Allback, Deco, Pauleta, David James and C.Ronaldo (some dont appear on the profile but they do during a game), there are less glitches/bugs in this game, has slightly better gameplay and some of the underated players got slightly higher ratings than in FIFA 2004, the Minus track is very good and there are free Euro 2004 stickers with this game:)(The free stickers were very good as i got some rares like Nesta). The only downfall about this game is the Holland team is very f***ed up as it dosent include the names and some of the faces of the players, I found this very unfair indeed as I saw another international football game in the gamestore with the official names of the Holland squad. But even so overall id still say this is a better game than Fifa 2004"
1,Nothing New,"This is lazy programming at its worst. This is a dumbed down version of FIFA 2004, its got nothing new, it hasn't even nailed the feel of euro 2004 as it has no real player intros, the commentators only have a couple of new things to say and theres no DVD content like there was in world cup 2002 (the only good feature from that title) The things that have changed are a downgrade, i liked the off the ball system of Fifa 2004 in Euro 2004 however its a lot harder to pull off. the shooting is also now pointlessly more difficult and the power of the shots is far to slow and weak. Don't Buy, if you haven't got FIFA 2004 get that instead, if you have theres no reason to buy this trash."
1,Dont buy it!!!,"This game is the worst soccer game EA sports ever made, sucks. First of all, Netherlands team......doesn`t exist....not names, nor faces, nothing!!! I really want my money back... the comments are erroneous....sometimes you are playing with germany and the comment says Bayer, or Inter....what???....Its to slow...the menus are slow....the game is slow, everything is going bad...I really hope that Fifa 2005 doesn`t suck like this game.....don`t buyit....you will regret if you do."
4,Easy read,Beevor does tend to use too many names however his accuracy and attempts to share this history have been mind blowing.
2,"An historical narrative, nothing more, nothing less","This book is a step by step account detailing events from the Russian invasion of East Prussia to the fall of Berlin in 1945. It reads like a descriptive list of events with precious little interpretation or commentary. There are pages upon pages that read like ""... and the next day, some troops moved three feet to the left....."" and so on. It also doesn't distinguish between key influential events of the battle and those that were ultimately inconsequential. Also, for a book whose primary focus is miltary logistics, it is woefully lacking in good quality maps.It does a sobering portrayal of the brutality of invading Soviets towards the German popluace, and I think it is this that will remain the book's enduring contribution. But I think given the richness of history that this book has to work with as its core material, the prose could've been so much better."
4,Modern Gothic History,"After reading Stalingrad, by the same author, I bought the unabridged audio cassette version of this book - about ten hours long.Like Stalingrad, it is a very vividly-written and well researched book that is both gripping and bleak.Although horrifying in parts, it is a story that cannot be repressed and is more of an epic human tragedy than any movie can portray.A compelling account of the last days of the third reich and the events that led to the start of the cold war."
1,Poor quality,"The piece hanging off of the necklace had already fallen off when I received, clasp broke and I never even got to wear it. Guess you get what you pay for."
2,Doesn't capture the joy I get from birding,I love bird-watching and have spent many happy hours around the world behind a pair of binoculars but this book captures very little of the joy I get from watching birds. Yes it's occasionally funny and occasionally well written but most of the time it consists of little more than the birder equivalent of name dropping. I came away with a strong feeling that birding is a clique of people who feel that they are the only people who know what real birding is.
2,Birding at its worst,"I'm an avid birder, but this book was very disappointing. Filled with, at most, mildly amusing anecdotes about obsessive people ""twitching"" (as the Brits call it) to add to their country lists, I had trouble finishing it. This is birding at its most fatuous. The author concedes that chasing rare birds has no intrinsic value, bringing into question whether reading about the chasers has any value, either.Kenn Kaufman's ""Kingbird Highway"" and George Levine's ""Lifebirds"" are much better books that capture the joy of birding and transcend the pointlessness of mere listing."
2,not very exciting,"I laughed out loud twice - far too little for a book! I took only 3 notes of ""places to see and bird"" - far too little. I wasn't even excited about food stories. Just isn't passionate enough - read Pete Dunne instead."
3,Twitchers on the other side of the pond,"This book offers a uniquely British perspective on fanatical birding. As a boy Mark Coker found a nest of pigeon eggs and from then on as he nears adulthood is taken with twitching. This is initially the story of the quest for new bird records, driving thousands of miles for a new British first. Like an addict, the juice from that drives them to greater thrills, foreign trips and to Nepal and the Satyr Tragopan. Perhaps more important, this is the story of a unique social group of fanatical birders and their unique language and tools: the quest for perfect notebooks, hitchhiking across country, staying at Cley, and the legendary Richard Richardson. This is a society whose only class structure is the ability to find birds. American readers will enjoy an amusing antidote about Roger Tory Peterson. A good, well written book, sometimes funny, sometimes poignant. Probably best for British birders or American's traveling overseas."
2,Too self-involved a book for this outsider to enjoy,"Although I generally love reading about birding and esp. the eccentric and obsessed birders among us, I found this book disappointing and could not make myself finish it. I don't think it was any British-ness about the characters that turned me off, unless we are to believe that a strong streak of pomposity and self-involvement are central to the British birder's character. The ""those were the days"" tone was not wistful, poignant, or nostalgic, but strangely superior and even curmudgeonly at times. To me, the book lacked the kind of approaches that make for good reading on the subject - objectivity, humor and/or vividly personal revelations. I just couldn't maintain any enthusiasm to continue reading about this particular tribe of more-significant-than-thou birders."
4,Hilarious!,"I loved this book and look forward to rereading it. I picked up the uncorrected proof at a used bookstore for 98 cents just for the hell of it, and it's a treasure! You have to understand British humour to ""get"" this book. Fortunately I'm half British so I do. I was glad to see the book was ultimately published."
5,"Finally, I get my hands on FLCL!!","I originally saw this on Adult Swim and I always wanted to own it. Now that I have my hands on it, I have to say that it was worth it! Six episodes plus extras, all on one disc. FUNimation did a phenomenal job with this license rescue. The encode is very well done, the audio quality is superb, its just about perfect! I'd totally recommend this any anime fan."
5,crazy and satisfying,one of the most insane anime i have ever seen. this has more character and fezaz to it than anything ive seen in a while. imagine every single aspect of anime blown out to supreme proportion. takun and haruko make this show. it has an absurd plot and makes you laugh every time. the color and animation looks flawless on blu ray with a good tv.a must buy for any fan of entertainment
3,SD Remaster? What a joke,"1080p 4:3 SD remaster, what a ripoff. This is why you need to be careful about buying ""high definition anime"" because the damn companies sometimes don't even try."
5,This copy works! And its great!,"Original:The disc does not show up on:My PS3My PCI have nothing else to try it on, but I doubt the disc would fail on my PS3 and PC when everything else works in them both.So I'm gonna assume this is just a broken disc.---02/26/2011---So the very next day after I mention to Amazon that it was not working they get me another one, it arrived here on a Saturday, I never get stuff on Saturdays.So yeah, +1 to Amazon customer service.Anyway, as far as the product is concerned its a great show, I know its just upscaled but it still looks great on my TV and is still a hilarious and weird show. I've always wanted to actually own it and this was finally my chance to."
4,FLCL is a FIVE but this blu-ray is a FOUR,"first off, i have a flcl dvd and planed to give it to a friend since i preordered this blu ray thinking it will replace it 10 tenfold. I was only being 1/4 correct since everything about the blu-ray is seemingly flawless with bonus features, 1080p res, but the whole thing that down stars this review is the fact the aspect ratio is 4x3 which to me seems something that should have ended with dvds a long time ago. So id like to know why would you convert a series into 1080p resolution and then put it in a small ratio that cant even fill almost any lcds, plasma, or leds. i consider this to be a lazy way to convert onto blu-ray for a gimick. if they can put bambi onto widescreen hdtv then come on why couldn't this be done. tsk tsk tsk tsk REMEMBER: my title of the review i give the blu ray a FOUR"
3,great show buuuut.....,"me and my wife love this show and i bought this for her because she never owned it before so i got this for her, but when i got it and played it i realized that this did not go to full screen even though its 1080p but i figured out how to expand but this is no reason to not to buy this series it's still awesome."
3,Eh... Shows it's date - especially not being in HD on Blu-Ray,"The craziness is fairly funny, but the entire anime itself shows it's date by not doing anything else spectacular. The anime is presented in SD format, and nothing special besides owning it in one collection. A RENT, or even a PASS for anime lovers. There are funnier, ""kookier"" anime series out there than this one."
2,Bad FLCL HD Port,"Great anime, but they did a poor job porting the SD format to HD (because of resolution, you get a couple of black spaces on both sides of the screen). Even after that the picture quality isn't the best."
3,Great Anime miniseries NOT WIDESCREEN though:(,"Love this series, the animation and weird Japanese sense of humor all rock. The transfer seems nice but it is labeled above as a WIDESCREEN format disc and this is NOT true unfortunately because on a big widescreen TV the images just chill in the 4x3 lookin frame and zoom cuts into the subtitles and distorts the images, oh well... Still a great and very inventive anime to know and love."
4,Good buy.,"I bought this for my friend for x-mas. He loved it. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the cover slip was slightly damaged. My friend didn't care though, he loves this show."
5,A MUST for any Anime collection,"If you liked Neon Genesis Evangelion, give this one a try.No real plot (pretty much random episodes), lots of explosions, craziness by the dozen, and an awesome soundtrack by the pillows to boot.Recommend this one for fans of the classics."
5,FLCL is nuts...and you have to love it.,"I'm not a person who really gets into anime, but FLCL is one of few exceptions. Combining a storyline with interesting higher themes and a killer soundtrack and you have the series that is FLCL. I wish there were even more episodes!"
5,Best Anime,"I had watched this on adult swim a couple years ago for the first time and never forgot about it. It is a mixture between comedy and action with a bit of a romantic side. Great series, only 6 episodes, but the best 6 i have ever seen."
5,Just as good as the DVD's.,"Being a show that's almost 10 years old, I think very few people expected FLCL to be in a native HD resolution.Yes, it's in 4:3.Does that change the fact this is a great deal? Absolutely not.You're getting the complete FLCL set (including all extras from the DVDs + some more Pillows music videos) at a price that is cheaper than the DVDs have ever been.The series looks exactly as it was intended, and there's very little to complain about if you're a fan of the series."
4,Almost Completely worth it,"I have been a big fan of this fun and short lived anime series. This is one of my favorite anime shows that i literally jumped on the chance to get this on blu-ray. Now that ive watched the bluray a bit, there is a noticeable upscale the video. Another good point to getting this vs the 3 dvds is its all on the same disk, meaning less space it takes on the shelf, so room for more anime or movies..bla bla bla. Furi Kiri was one of those kind of shows i only had briefly caught on cartoon network late at night. But from there i had to really look for it. I Kinda which there was more. I guess if you like any sort of anime, this is definitely for you. There are some mature themes in this series so if your into the cutesy anime you probably should shy away from this. But i will say it is definitely a good anime movie to start with. Its got fighting and robots, and comedy, and it just an overall good adventure! AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS ALSO AWSOME!FLCL Fooly Cooly OST 1: Addict"
4,Great,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loved it, the case looks nice and the disk plays well."
5,MS does it again,I have been listening to and loving Vinnie Moore with UFO. This CD reminded me why Michael Schenker was my first guitar idol.
4,WHERE WAS I ?,After boxing up all my old albums some years ago it seems I lost touch with UFO over the years except for one greatest hits CD bought several years back. WOW! Where have I been? Walk on Water is GREAT! Best of all it has Michael Schenker and Phill Mogg like the old days. The only reason I don't rate it a five is because i'm still in disbelief. What a great CD! KEEP ON ROCKIN UFO!
5,70s style hard rock at its best!,"WOW!This cd ROCKS and ROCKS HARD!Phil Moogs vocals are excellent and Michaeal Schenkers guitar playing is magnificent!I,m very thankfull these guys are making music together again.They are to UFO like Ozzy and Tony were to Sabbath. Songs like Pushed To The Limit and Knock Knock sound like the 70s UFO.Not to take anything away from Phil Moog( I respect him as one of hard rocks better singers)but UFO was just not the same without Schenker. To all UFO fans,BUY THIS CD!"
5,These guys are still AWESOME!!,"I had only heard Venus (radio) and just finally got around to buying this CD. UFO has done an excellent job of carrying on the tradition of smooth, grinding, complex, ROCK-N-ROLL. There is not one unlikeable song on the disk.It amazes me why a band as talented (musically and lyrically) as this group is does not get more air-play than so many of these other ""c""rap and grunge bands get. I look forward to their next endeavor."
5,My Favorite!,"As a guitarist, I have followed UFO since I first saw them on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert many moons ago at my folks house when I was a kid. I won't say best, though to me I could. If you're a player, it's a fun bonus to play along. These are some of the best ending solos ever. The remakes of Dr. Dr. and Lights Out are great. Wish the earlier stuff had this quality production, too. You won't be dissappointed."
5,Add this to your collection !!,"Imagine my suprise when I ""stumbled"" on WALK ON WATER, and saw that the original lineup is back!! The ""edge"" is still there. In fact, this album reminded me of OBSESSION. I especially liked Pushed To The Limit and Darker Days. The remixed versions of Doctor Doctor and Lights Out were great."
1,A sad day for a big UFO fan,"Well, nice try guys, but you're TOO OLD! At least, that's how it sounds to me, a die-hard fan who used to think UFO really could walk on water. Where's the fire? Long extinguished, I suppose. And was there supposed to be a bass player on this album?? If so, he's nowhere to be heard on the mix. I've heard basement tapes that sound as good...And is that Michael Schenker or Joe Satriani playing lead guitar? What happened to Michael's fiercely original and articulate solos? If I wanted to hear Satriani/Steve Vai-style wankage (which I don't), I'd buy THEIR albums.Like a fool, I read everyone else's comments online, and bought the CD actually thinking that the boys had put out something worthy of their former glory. Boy, was I disappointed!! The remakes of 'Doctor, Doctor' and 'Lights Out' drove a stake through my heart. I almost cried. Oh well, at least I still have my copy of 'Strangers In The Night' to remind me of what UFO sounded like at their peak..."
5,Fine album,"Being a big Shenker fan, when i finally found out he had returned to UFO for 3 albums at a later date and bought them, I was pleasantly suprised at how good this album was. Phil Moog especially impressed me, though I have never esteemed him much before, in this group of songs, he was excellent, and Michael and the boys did a great job too. Recommended to UFO fans new and old."
4,As Good As Ever,A lot of these great bands are still rockin'. You'd never know it though from the sad state of radio. This is a great record. If you like Michael Schenker and UFO buy this.
5,A must have,Ufo puts out their best cd here's ripping leads with Plil Mogg at his best after not being together for over twenty years this band was hungey and it shows. The band was ready to tear things up and that they did this made chills go up and down my spine.The remake of lights out smoked the old one These guys kicked butt and left us begging for more this cd ranks in my top ten cd's ever put out and I have sixteen hundred cd's get the picture buy this Jimmy B
5,One of the Best Rock Albums Ever!,"I've been listening to rock and roll for forty years. I've heard it all. I started listening to these guys when I was in law school in the '70s and they've always been great. I have just about everything they've ever done. When I heard ""Venus"" on the radio, I knew I had to get this, even though I'm somewhat skeptical of reunion things. But, wow....This thing just totally blew me away. ""Darker Days"" is one of the best overall rockers of all time. Every cut is absolutely incredible and the first seven tracks are probably the best seven tracks in a row on any album ever produced. I could have done without the re-mixes of ""Doctor Doctor"" and ""Lights Out in London"" since they take away from the first seven tracks. Michael Schenker is not just in top form, but shows that he is right up there with any of the great ""axemen."" The solo and outro in ""Darker Days"" is spine-tingling and you just want it to keep going. This album is a must buy."
1,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book in that it would offer full-color plates of some of the most beautiful American art, that of Pennsylvania impressionists. I was sorely disappointed and returned the book immediately. Why would anyone who appreciates such fine art want such a reference book that is mostly black and white plates that do not do the artwork justice?"

5,Beautiful haunting poetry accompanies lilting music.....,"Jagjit Singh has once again proved that he is king of ghazal land with this soothing compilation aptly called ""face to face."" Beautiful haunting poetry accompanies lilting music -- giving you mesmerising songs full of love, spirit & soul. A big fan of Jagjit, I own each of his ghazal albums, but ""face to face"" is undoubtedly my favorite!"
2,Think twice before purchasing!!!!,"I can't believe that Jeremy Mcgrath actually let Acclaim put his name on this game. I am a diehard motocross rider and fan. I already have MX2002 and think its the best game ever invented. I bought Supercross world the day it came out thinking it would be a better game than the one Carmicheal endorsed, simply because all of the awsome riders endorsed Supercross World. I am totally disatisfied with this game. i have played it maby 3 times since i bought it about 2 weeks ago. i still play MX2002 daily. I strongly urge anyone that is planning on buying this game to rent it first. You will find that you will be completley turned off by everything it has to offer. MX2002 is better all the way around in every way possible."
2,Supercross World Blows,"What is there to say about Supercross World? Horrible graphics. Robotic animations. Bad riders. Stupid tracks. Queer trick system. Repetitive. Easy. No free ride. Bikes are all the same, vary only by color. Terrible gameplay. No thought was put into this game whatsoever. Don't even rent it. I'm sure anyone who owns this game will be happy to give it away."
1,McGrath just lost again.,Let me just say McGrath lost to RC again but this time in the video game world. If you want a good motocross game get Mx 2002 instead.
2,There are better choices,"This was really a disappointment for me (and I only rented it). The graphics are only fair, and the handling is nothing like being real. MX2002 is a FAR superior game.....in every respect."
1,Do not waste your money..,"I recently bought the Playstation 2 after being a big PC gamer. I am into Motocross Madness 2 alot for pc's. I decided to give this new title a try on PS2 because it seemed to get good reviews. I was very disapointed with this game. So unhappy, that I wanted to return the game within 5 minutes of playing it. The handling is very unrealistic. The tracks and decent in my opinion but the bike is hard to control. I really hated to give this game a bad review, but it is nothing I expected. If you really want a high quality game for PS2, buy ATV Offroad Fury. The creator of Motocross Madness 2 made this game and the handling of the bike is 100% better. I am hoping other titles for PS2 such as MX Rider and MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael will be better."
2,Is McGrath trying to steal the crown?,I am a fan of both Carmicheal and McGrath. I race dirtbikes also. I like Carmicheal better as a person and as a racer. Jeremy has to do some real butt kicking to beat MX 2002. I dont care if MX 2002 is unrealistic its fun and that is all that matters. We will see who will win.
2,KING,JEREMY WILL BE THE KING AGAIN ONCE HE REGROUPS AND FOCUSES ON RIDING.EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT RICKY BECAUSE HE ONE A FEW RACES.JUST WATCH THIS YEAR WHEN THE KING SPANKS HIM AND GETS. BACK THAT #1.
5,Just When It was Getting Realy Good,"As a fan boy of the 1980's series I have no problem saying that this remake was a fun show from the start, but in the final season it got to its best parts. The story focused more the development of characters and Eternia's history and less on ideas for new toy designs. The episodes are fluid and well written...and then it was canceled...idiot execs >:^(This is a must have for fans of the new and old He-man universes."
4,"WAS GOOD, BUT WANTED I MORE","LOVED THE SERIES, BUT IT ENDED TOO QUICKLY. WITH NOT A VERY GOOD FINALITY TO THE WHOLE STORY."
1,DOES NOT WORK IN AMERICA,This seller is horrible. The dvd's they sell DO NOT WORK ON AMERICAN DVD players. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. Not nice remarks to me when asked for a new dvd that would work or return. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!!!!! You will regret it.
4,"Disc 1, Flawless. Great Package, great episodes","I just got it today. I was worried, a fellow buyer posted a review saying episode 3 in disc one freezes around the 15 min mark, even worse than the flaw in vol 1. I watched the rest of the episodes and left the supposedly defective one for last, had my fingers crossed. It went SMOOTHLY all the way until the end...what a RELIEF. NO FLAWS in any episode in disc 1, i havent checked disc 2yet, still a little nervous, hopefully it will be alright. COOL CARDS and cool package, have to buy vol 1 to complete the series, i know the courage of adam episode in vol 1 is defective but i can live with that. My only complaint,,,,I WANT MORE OF THIS SHOW...THANKS AGAIN AMAZON."
5,Too bad there was no season three!,"The new He-Man is everything that the original series from the 80s was not- well animated, with a compelling dialog that both children and adults can enjoy. Personally I think that it was targeted to appeal in large part to the fans of the original series- kids then, adults in their 20s and early 30s now.Volume 3, the final volume of the DVD release of the series, covers the completion of season 2. It's too bad there was no season 3 as it was rumored that the She-ra storyline was going to be brought in, which would have been very cool indeed.Still, seeing the rise of the snake men, the orgins of Grayskull, and some characters that the original show never showed but were included in the old comic books (Stinkor, Mossman, and so on) plus very high production values make this a great addition to anyone's DVD library. Do get the other 2 volumes first though!"
5,"As Quark books go, this is the best.","As Quark books go, this is the best. There is no other Quark book I know of that combines both the ""been there"" authority and range of information found here."
4,Refreshing entertainment,"It was so nice to hear something that I could understand without someone screaming their warped psycho babble at me. The songs seem to be well written and the lyrics are clean ad simple. I only gave it 4 stars because there is always room for improvement. That is unless you are Steve Earle. ""Broken Watch"" takes such a simple idea and turns it into a catchy little tune. I bet Mr. Earle never thought of a song like that. The whole CD is very enjoyable and well worth it. What a bargain at less than a buck a song."
4,"lively,vivacious and with a distinct stamp of indianness","the sound of his music has created a distinct and noticeable ripple in the music wavepool. gifted with a far reaching deep baritone,this artist has made a deep impact on the indians at home and all the asians staying abroad. He, though, does possess the tendencies of being repetitive , and if at all he endeavours to rule majestically on the million hearts,should start adding few more aces in his repertoire,based on the great hindustani music.and like the great nusrat fateh ali khan,should try his notes on the inimitable verses of the likes of amir khusro etc. ."
3,Hahahahaha,"I find this music to be very very cheesyif u want to laugh, check out this music video for one of his songs: http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/tunak.php"
1,Cheesiest music i have ever heard,"This dudes music has to be the funniest stuff i have ever heard. Its so cheesy that i can't stop laughing, the guy actually takes himself seioursly. If you really want to laugh check out some of his videos. Overall the music ... unless you really want to ... other people off. In that case get this cd."
5,Gateway between worlds,Understanding the path of occult practices as a way to enhance personal power - an unusual book for its genre with great appeal for students of occult science.
2,Nice stories; not very useful for coaching,"Nice stories about pro teams using the flat back 4. If you're a coach looking to learn it and coach it, Amazon has 2 other excellent books instead (Coaching the 4-4-2; Soccer's 4-4-2 System)."
5,Excellent,Great tactical stuff for coaches and fans of the game alike. Andy Gray also injects his humor and anecdotes into the book.
5,One of the best sources of stat for states,"I think it is by far one of the best sources of reliable stat. for the states. Most tables are from official government publications and almost all of the are up to date. I used the book as a source for a class project and checked some of the numbers with the original sources and they were all correct, at least the ones I used. My only suggestion for future publication is that I wish the authors give the latest data for a state where the data is not available. For example I needed data for divorce rate for all states and data for California , Colorado, Louisiana were missing. I know these data are hard to come by [ for those particular states], but they could have at least given the data for latest year that is available. Otherwise this book should be in the reference section of all libraries."
1,cloying,Heavy handed lyrics with a cloying religious undertonethankfully spelled the doom of this misguided project.
4,Atom,"This is my favorite Wood picture. Originally called Bride of the Atom, this was Ed's anti-nuclear picture. This one is just bad all the way around. Bad script, bad acting, bad sets, and just some terrible continuity errors. The entire film takes place in a couple of rooms and 1 outdoor set. The laboratory is laughable as is this awful fight between Bela and Tor with the obvious double for a frail Lugosi. But all that badness equals a lot of fun. This is one of those films you just watch shaking your head wondering how it ever got made. It's a strange fun ride."
2,Not Much Story Here,"This movie fooled me as it's sort of funny and horror related all at the same time. The story does not have much to it, and the only truly good actor...the only actor...was Bela Lugosi. I got the movie thinking it had to be great if Lugosi was in it, but even a great actor can't compensate for a poor story ...which drags at times. The movie was so slow, I literally fell asleep watching it 3 times. I had to start it again and again.And not sure why they colorized this movie either. The ""monster"" is just an octopus in a aquarium. When they colorized it they used a bright blue background. The monster is supposed to be attacking some men at night! Special effects don't exist in this movie.Not a favorite for me and I am a true B-movie fan."
3,Another masterwork from Ed Wood,"Another oddity from Ed Wood, who at least had a co-writer for this one, making it a shade more coherent than his other films. Still, the script, the sets, and the special effects are vintage Ed Wood. The flaccid rubber octopus is perhaps the least frightening ""monster"" in all of filmdom. Tor Johnson is amusing, and Lugosi hams it up all the way. A campy laughfest."
2,"""He tampered in God's domain""","BRIDE OF THE MONSTER (aka BRIDE OF THE ATOM) is another collaboration between Ed Wood, the worst director of all time and horror legend Bela Lugosi (and let's not forget Tor Johnson). This entry centres around mad scientist Lugosi's attempt to create a master race of atomic superbeings to carry out his goal of (What else?) world domination.Amusing,but not as good/bad as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. The movie is still worth a look if only for the ""seriousness"" with which Wood made it. BRIDE OF THE MONSTER's most ""elaborate"" set piece is a giant rubber octopus which makes the squid in 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA look like footage from a Jacques Costeau documentary. A fun time-killer for lovers of bad movies, especially at its compact 69 minute running time."
3,A classic by Ed Wood.,One of Ed Woods more famous films. Not as bad as the reputation says. If you like the old Monogram films with Bela Lugosi you'll like this one too. Bela Lugosi plays a mad scientist trying to create superhumans in his cottage in the swamps. Tor Johnson is perfectly cast as Bela's angora loving servant Lobo. A must for lovers of old horror movies.
4,The best of the three,"I must say, I've seen all three of the Wood films in which Lugosi got credit and in my oppinion it is the best of the three. If you're an Ed or Bella fan, this is absolutely esential for the collection."
4,One of the better sci-fi movies of its time,"I purchased the ""Box Set"" of Ed Wood movies. I wish the entire Ed Wood collection were available. However I thought this one was his best effort. Yes some of the acting is bad but the movie has a good plot. After watching this I wonder what Ed could have accomplished if he would have had a decent budget, like the sci-fi directors of today have. In the 50's science fiction was not taken in the same manner that it is today. Directors like Ed Wood brought it to the screen and was, in my opion, ahead of his time. The man had a dream and followed it, regardless of the end result."
4,Hilarious,"BRIDE OF THE MONSTER is perhaps Ed Wood's best film, it's outragously fun, fast-moving and very, very funny (even funnier than Wood's infamous PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE). Not for all tastes but I reckon it's cool. END"
3,Ed Wood's Best Film and Lugosi's Last Hurrah,"Released in 1956, ""Bride of the Monster"" is an enjoyable schlock-fest from Grade-Z auteur Edward D. Wood, Jr. However, the film rises above its ultra-low budget thanks to the presence of Bela Lugosi. Regardless of personal and professional misfortunes, Bela plays Dr. Eric Vornoff as though it were the performance of his life. Sadly, it would be Lugosi's last starring and speaking role. Despite the amateurish supporting cast and obvious production flaws (who can forget that rubber octopus), ""Bride of the Monster"" has a comic-book charm that's hard to resist - definitely superior to Wood's ""Glen or Glenda"" (1953) and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (1959). Hollywood has managed to surpass Ed Wood's cinematic ineptitude on a larger scale with ""Showgirls"" and ""Battlefield Earth."" For once, let's give the Master of Bad Cinema his due."
4,Good book,"Very nicely written, lot of information on many areas of interest. Information is easy to understand, guidance with pictures are also provided. Very nice."
4,This LP is a hip-hop landmark.,"The Jungle Brothers put afrocentricity front and center with this album. And it's among the best-produced LP's in hip-hop history. With this LP, the JBeez set the stage for other groups like A Tribe Called Quest, Digable Planets, and XClan to take the jazz-hop/afrocentric movement forward. Regrettably, it is not highly touted but is as good as any hip-hop LP anyone has ever put out."
4,A Lost Classic,"One of the members of the Native Tongues Posse, the Jungle Brothers are an amazing fusion hip-hop band. A lot has been said about their incorporation of house music into their rapping style, and it is true. But for music to be so danceable and Afro-centric and meaningful... well, let's just say it's a feat that has not been repeated. Endlessly experimental on this album and playful to boot. The key tracks are the first track (Beyond This World) and Acknowledge Your Own History. A great moment in old school rap and rap in general. Filled with bumping beats to dance to and great lyrics!"
5,A Great Uplifting Disc,"The Jungle Brothers created a Solid Disc here.Mixing many styles as One.Very Uplifting Words.When You Hear Albums Like This You Know Black Is Beautiful and You Feel Pride.this was When Rap was It's Glory.Folks Make More Money now but at the Expense of Wacker Material.The Jungle Brothers,&The Native Tongues Crew along With Public Enemy,B.D.P,X-Clan&Others were saying Something.Pro-Black.Not Anti Anything but Love Yourself First&Foremost.that Message has Gotten Lost.The Music Hasn't though.Acknowledge Your Own History Speaks Volumes to this Day."
3,Exceptional,"Let it first be known that I can't stand rap or hip hop. Never again will I rate an album from this generally abhorrible genre so highly. If all rap music was this varied, intelligent, unifying, and yet undeniably funky, the ghetto would be a much happier place. Err. Um, and I mean no racial slur by that... really. Ouch. Sorry, but is it really possible these days (or was it ever) to discuss rap music without bringing race into it? Please teach me how."
4,hidden classic,Afrika Bambaataa had a profound influence on so many great groups. Tribe Called Quest and DeLa Soul get the most credit but there are many other native tongue visionaries. Years later this is the kind of album that I wish people paid attention too over fake gangsters and prepackaged beefs. Ignore that nonsense and enjoy smart lyrics and tight beats.
3,A nice compilation...,"...but somewhat limited.It could have included a wider time span, and more music genres. In my opinion a jukebox should be more varied. Having said that it has some excellent songs, and the sound is good."
4,A good source about my family's ancestry,I purchased this when I was on a little quest to get in touch with my dad's family's heritage. It's informative and readable. I especially enjoyed the little section on Wendish folkways.
1,Very Disappointing,"Although I approached this book with an open mind, I was extremely disappointed with it. Sullivan seems to be saying that only a monogamous homosexual, or one who has achieve virtuous ex-gay status can achieve the correct morality as assigned by the his own Roman Catholocism. Yet his own experience with HIV, unsafe sex, and promiscuity seems to contradict this. At a time when so many Roman Catholic Priests are being prosecuted as pedophiles and many teens are stepping forward with tales of abuse, is it logical for Sullivan to be touting his own 'ethics'? What I found most disturbing was his insistence that morality is only a theory or abstract idea and one's own conduct (ie his own websites) must be ignored and excused as 'private' sins which may result in one's death, but are nevertheless innocent 'mistakes'. (...)"
4,Mix of Celtic & Rock That Works,"My parents tried to introduce this band to me when i was in 8th grade, which was five years ago. I disliked Wolfstone then, and missed a FREE concert by them because of it. A stupid mistake, for if i had liked them then i wouldn't have missed their only concert coming to my area of the world.Anyhow, you will like Wolfstone if you like Celtic music and progressive rock. Also if you like Jethro Tull and/or Tempest, this might just be your type of thing."
5,Celtic Electric!,"Once again, Wolfstone have produced a suberb compilation of lively and inspiring music, combining well thought out lyrics with outstanding musicianship and raw talant. A particular favourite is ""Close it down"", written about the terrible employment prospects in Scotland at the time.Incidentally, Ravenscraig steelworks closed soon after, making it seem even more poignent.Overall, a fantastic experience from the masters."
4,Neat little item,Neat little item for Simpsons fans. The can is a little bigger than a real beer can. The top fits snugly but pulls off easily. Inside is a deck of Simpsons-themed standard playing cards. I keep this on a side table next to a life-size cardboard standee of Homer in my home theater.
5,Great financial and wrestling book,"This book is entertaining and informative and that is how I judge this book. On the entertainment side, there are some nice stories about JBL's life in wrestling and being a wrestling fan, I found these stories interesting. A little on the light side, this is certainly not an expose on wrestling...nor is it advertised to be. So, from a wrestling perspective, it delivers what I expected.On the financial side, there is nothing earth shattering here but it is a pretty good template for living your life. It has some very good, solid financial advice that would help basic and young investors, especially. So, in that regard, I also feel that the book delivers on its' financial advice.I recommend this book."
2,My first Personal Financial Management book I bought...I wish I knew better,"I first bought this book almost a year ago when I was clueless about personal finance stuff...Me being a wrestling fan the book was pretty interesting when Layfield mentions about stuff behind wrestling's curtain. But with regards with actual financial managment stuff...its ok at best...Bottom line...don't get this book...Van Tharp's ""Safe Strategies For Financial Freedom"" is a much better bet!!!"
2,Flash over substance,"I am a big wrestling fan and I love the JBL's gimmicks. But this book have absolutely no financial sense. If you look for a ""How to get rich book"" forget it! It is more like an endless parade of boring football anecdotes and useless wrestling stories with very little financial astuce. Despite the fact that I love JBL and I love his persona, don't waste a single dollard on this book. Unfortunately, you won't become the second coming of J.R.Ewing by reading this book.Don't waste your money and your time!"
5,Decent read,"I thaught reviews were for books. I have an idea... read the book then leave comments on the book!!! grow up!!!Being an individual who got into serious debt after high school, I totally agree with the other reviewer that stated, this information would have been great back before I got myself into debt. Great general ideas to managing your fiances and planning for your future."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the quality of the item. The zippers did not match the fabric and were sewn rather unevenly. The piping around the pillows was not sewn evenly either and the pillow stuffing did not fill out the pillow covers at all.
2,POOR sewing,"I was disappointed when I went to put this on my futon. The seam of the zipper was torn about six inches. How does this pass inspection before being sent out? I would return it, but I don't want to deal with the hassle and wait. I can fix it, but I expected a bit more quality than this. Really disappointed with the quality of sewing."
3,Dark For 1949,"stories of people moving on after failed romances. If there is a theme, it's that stormy moody people are attracted to each other and eventually wear each other out. Bergman already showed a gift for putting the camera in just the right place and using the surrounding scenery and sounds to enhance the emotional tone. It feels like this is the world he lived in and wanted to reveal subtle details."
3,Three Strange Loves (aka Thirst),"This film features some of Bergman's ""signature"" devices, later developed by him to perfection. His trademark psychological soul-digging and studying of human sensuality are heavily imbedded in the film's texture. One can (cautiously) call it a milestone."
1,Just Horrible-by Regan,"They are horrible because they are trying to play and sing like men,but they are heavy metal and when I heard their songs I was laughing."
3,Decent,"This isn't bad, but I've seen a lot better rodeo videos. While I appreciate Walt Garrison's support of the sport of rodeo, I'd rather it be moderated by a rodeo star and not a football star. It gets a 3-star rating from me, but if it were judged on a 100-point scale like a bronc ride, I'd probably give it a 68."
5,Fun,"Bought these for church for my 2/3 year olds. I bought a couple of magnet books and they are very quiet to play with during church. Problem was we moved recently and I forgot to pull these out of their rooms and put them out of reach. Being so young we lost the magnets now, but had I put them up and only gotten them out while watching them it would have been better. The magnets are very very thin, which is good for the little books, but also easy to make. I have thought about going and buying Tonka stickers and sticking them to thin magnets, cutting them out and having a whole new set. (That is what these are essentially), we still have all the magnet boards in great condition. If your looking for a way to entertain kids in church, on a plane- or any other time you need something a little more quiet this is perfect."
4,Classic Frankie,Needed some classy music to play on the deck drinking martinis on vacation in Key West. Nothing better than Sinatra singing the smooth stuff. These twenty do the job. The only reason I do not give it five stars is that a few classic Frank's are not on this album
3,Capitol versus Reprise,"These arrangements are too slow and too ""Nelson Riddle-ly"". The Reprise ""Greatest Hits: The Very Good Years"" is a better bet, but not all of the songs here are available there. Frank deserves very spare arrangements to showcase his phenomenal phrasing!"
5,Great intro to the master,"This compilation is a good taste of Sinatra's 50's work for Capitol. If someone is unfamiliar with the overall catalog, this disc is a good place to start, as the songs are familiar and (in many cases) their best versions. Don't stop with this one, however. The concept albums themselves, as well as the Columbia and Reprise years, should be sampled (and savored) as well."
2,Like a 45rpm disc,Should have been remastered but at that price I enjoyed crooning to my favorite lyrics.
4,"Great sampler of his ""concept"" albums","If you are a big enough fan to own all of Sinatra's 50s concept albums, then you really do not need this CD as the songs are all from those albums. However, this is a wonderful sampler for casual Sinatra fans and it includes all his greatest songs from that era (I particularly like ""One More for My Baby."") If you want to get one of the actual full albums from this era of Sinatra, start with Songs for Swingin' Lovers - it's terrific!"
5,"Quality recordings, good selection","Old blue eyes didn't fail with the songs on this album. His voice comes in clearly without losing the orchestra's appeal in the background. The album includes 20 of his best songs, including my favorite Gershwin hit ""Someone to Watch Over Me."" The songs come from numerous different albums, such as ""This is Sinatra,"" ""Songs For Young Lovers,"" ""In the Wee Small Hours,"" and ""Songs For Swingin' Lovers."" Few albums compare to this one in selection of Capitol years songs, with one possible rival being ""The Best of the Capitol Years.""If you're looking for one Sinatra album for your collection, I highly recommend this album."
5,Ahhhhhhhh..............,"These songs were released when I was a little boy, and I remember this music being all around the atmosphere in my youth: being played by my parents & sisters; on the radio, television & in the movies. It made me a sucker for a melody and a deft lyric, a trait that stayed with me through early Rock, the Beatles, Acid Rock and the advent of Metal, and so on and so forth. It is also why I pretty much detest Rap and most of Hip Hop in general.So, from the first playing of this CD it was like being wrapped in something warm & comfortable like a favorite old flannel shirt. Here are 20 easy classics by some of the greatest American songwriters (Gershwin, Porter, Cahn, Van Huesen etc.), ably arranged by Nelson Riddle, and sung by the definitive male stylist of the era. Just great American music, lush and romantic. And that ain't bad."
2,Christians stay away from this book.,"S.E. Frost is either highly misinformed on Christian matters, or a liar. He states that we have never been able to answer the problem of evil and sin, which we have. He declares that we do not know who created the devil, and we do. He does have a couple of gems in the book, but if you are a Christian, or atleast open to truths, even the ones you don't like. I believe they would be better found elsewhere."
1,Not for survivor of suicide,The book is dated and not sensible at all if you lost a child to suicide. Very few things in the book are actually useful for the bereaved parent that is already a long way into grieving. Not good at all if your loss is very recent.
1,Not what I expected,"I just finished reading this book. I am now three years into losing my son. First I have to say, this book is not for someone who has just lost there child. In the first chapeter she explains how you have to do what is right for you, then on another page she is telling you what you should do, because people who have studied greaving say it is the right thing to do.First on my part, I did not agree with anything that was said by her. I could not even read the whole book in full, I started skipping pages. At the end when she says she is sorry that her son is dead, but she still has joys, and so should I we. Some people can go forward better than others, but most parents don't.This was my only son, I will feel this pain for the rest of my life. Again I don't suggest anyone who just lost a child read this, in fact I don't even think anyone should even read it at all. poorly written! Hands down to this author."
1,IF,"If there were a description of the book, telling me what it's about or and an oppurtunity to see the contents I would have a better idea of what this and other books contain as it is I feel like I need to look at it in a bookstore to see what it contains instead of just how people felt. I wanted to get it for a family who suffered a loss but would it help their particular situation. It has made the difference in more than one case and I'm probably not that diferent from a lot of other people."
5,The Bereaved Parent,"I received this book from a very good friend,when my son died. It was so helpful to me during that horrific time. Since then I have purchased four more of these books to give to my friends that found themselves in the same situation I was. Losing a child is absolutely the worst thing that could happen to a parent. This book will help in a small way to get parents through some of those rough times."
4,Fantastic,Another fantastic CD by Mac himself. Any of Mac's music is great for just about any kind of party. Good CD!
3,"OK, But Not Great","This is definitely not an in-depth retrospective fo the USFL itself. It is quite good at proving Donald Trump pretty much was the worst thing ever for the spring league. Would love to see more of a true historical sense of the league done some day by the producer, as he obviously has the knowledge and footage to do such a project."
3,Entertaining but not enough character development,"While I have found this book to be very entertaining, it is very weak. The author does not spend a great deal of time developing the characters, and I spent most of the book not caring whether or not the heroine succeeds. I never really feel like I get to know the main character or her motivations. I also find it very condescending that everytime the heroine succeeds against the villan it happens just because she is told it can. The author never really explains why. On a whole, I feel the book has a lot of great themes; good vs. evil and good will succeed against evil, but it would probably be suited to a younger audience (under 10 years)."
2,Mediocre,A book of mostly advertisements. Some out of date. No objectivity. Not one negative review or critical statement in the book. All is glorius. A few gems in a bag of rocks.
2,What can I say...........,You'd have to be on drugs to like this crap. The whole concept is F'd up! I think the writer and/or director must have smoked alot of stuff before they filmed this! The biker helmets look more like they're glasses than it resembiling a skull. If you like movies that really suck ass then this is for you! I'd rather watch paint dry or do nasty things to my cat with a plastic fork than ever watch this again!!!
3,Pyromania,"Psychomania, AKA The Death Wheelers (1973), has a power-mad, destructive motorcycle gang kill themselves and come back again from death even more malicious and petty in this shoddy English entry into the paranormal biker genre. Psychomania combines the supernatural with touches of A Clockwork Orange (1971) to alter the trashy 60's biker film style.Not many films quite like Psychomania. Given the psychological emphasis, it's easy to see how it'd leave an especially strong impression on anyone who saw it as a Evel Knievel, motorcycle loving kid. The idea that an entire, albeit isolated, motorcycle gang would embrace the supernatural and death rituals is far-fetched enough, if harmless.There's also a George Sanders, frog-worshipping number that's a bore to look at, but again, too bizarre for words.While it was a watchable biker movie, it was one that I could have done without."
4,Adam's Best,"I'll tell you what Adam did was write good, infectious, pop songs for the early 80's. Here he was at the top of his game. Just try not whistling to any of these bristling pop tunes, I dare you. Only mis-step is a cover of the Doors ""Hello I Love You"", other than that, good clean pop fun for Adam on his first solo effort, which I might add would end up being his best solo effort."
4,"A friend, not a foe","It is hard to believe that Adam Ant was somewhat controversial way back when this album came out, thanks to his pirates/Indians outfits. But the songs on this album are so strong, he makes a lot of friends. Forget making enemies. For those looking for something other than a ""greatest hits"" disc, this is a good start--solid throughout."
5,The Best MadelineMovie everrrrr,"It` spring! Flowers are Blooming! everything is new... Exept for Bon Bo`s tattere hat, Whih makes her very blue.Madeline and friends leave there house half past 9. They find Bon Bon the milk wagon horse. Her hat is old and they decorate it into a bonnet. Then the wind blows it away into a hat shop and lands on a persons head and order`s it. Madeline sees it and goes into the shop. She explains about it and they add something new to it and give it to Bon Bon."
4,DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS,"this game here....first of all it does differ a lot from the first shaddow man. it is worth the small amount of money by far, and it is extremly fun game. but how much fun it is would definatly be the downfall of this game. they didnt put the length into this one like they did the first shaddow man. it definatly isnt long enough. there was way more that they could have done with this to drag it on and it definatly would not of been a mistake. but yeah this game is really good aside from that one problem. you will travel all over the world and explore old and new areas of deadside to stop the end of mankind. great adventure game."
2,Waste of time.,"I was a huge fan of the original Shadowman; great story and gameplay.. So, inevitably, I purchsed SM2 immeadiately upon release. Bad idea. This game is awful. The music, sound, graphics, engine, dialogue, story and control are all far worse than the first time around. On top of that, you have to wait a good 30 seconds to load all the {stuff}. My best advice is to simply don't fire another neuron in relation to this game."
2,ignore the hype...,"The graphics are not nearly as detailed, realistic nor impressive as DMC. The characters look like they were pulled directly off the football field from Blitz- big, bulky and cartoonish. The controls are awkward, utilizing the right analog stick to strife renders it difficult to view along side or behind you or turn to attack a pursuing enemy. The combination moves aren't nearly as impressive (I really wouldn't even classify them as a ""combo"" move at all...) as in DMC, and the weapons had much more promise than what was actually used. Scenery is dull, drab and repetitive- and very, very dark- I had to adjust the color settings on my TV. Occasionally a cool graphical scene will pop up..."
2,Bad Game -- Don't Buy,"From my 12-year-old son: The game is not realistic, has poor graphics, and is boring. Beware of the language (not listed on the box) and you should just not get it. It's not even worth $9.99."
4,fall asleep,some people give great reviews but this game is a joke. If you want to waste your time Play this game. Just remember what I said. waste of time
4,A waaaayyy better than what I expected!,SM2 is without a doubt a very cool game with a good story and lots of gameplay. Basically it is fantasy game where you play a detective/gangster/superhero/undead character who must find various items in order to beat the end boss. Okay we have all been there before but SM2 does it aces and there is huge amount of game play involved with dozens of different unique weapons and lots of action with over three dozen different locations. I was playing SM2 for well over a week and enjoyed every minute of it. The voodoo weapons are really what makes this game so cool and they are extremely original. The maps are vast and there is a challange playing each one. This game is better than most other action games on the PS2 and is a must for any collection.I highly recommend that you give SM2 a whirl. You will not be dissapointed!
3,Not very good I'm afraid...,"I read the Powers Script Book and was not impressed. I've read many scripts, and I don't know what the fuss is with Brian Michael Bendis. I must admit, the dialogue was pretty good... but that's as far as it goes. The story was pretty ho-hum and the scripts were littered with spelling mistakes. Bendis even misspelled 'bored' by spelling 'board'... all the way to using E.T.A. (Estimated Time of Arrival) in the wrong context.... I also noticed some of his descriptions were plagiarised directly from some Hollywood scripts word for word. Buy it if you're a fan, but read other scripts if you want to get some tips."
5,Crazy about this sauce,Daughter was on the east coast for 3 months. She could not find Tapatio any where except on location and the bottle was very small. Had to order from Amazon for her. She was very happy!
3,"Tapatio is ok, but it's not as good as Valentina's.","I've loved Tapatio ever since I can recall but it's a second best to my Valentina's sauce, it just doesn't compare."
5,I love salsa,"Once again this is the only way I can get this salsa in japan. It was shipped fast and ahead of time, munchas thank yous"
5,Superb sauce,"A little more heat than cayenne pepper sauces like Tabasco but nowhere near as hot as the hotter habanero sauces. It has a great flavor that goes well with a variety of foods, flavors salad dressing, sandwich spread and barbeque sauces and make the blandest dishes come to life. It ranks in the upper tier of my favorite sauces."
4,"Great product, quick shipping","I received this product from a friend of mine who is from AZ and immediately fell in love with it. It's slightly thicker than Tabasco and Trappey's, but not as sour, and with a little bit more heat. It goes well with almost EVERYTHING. So, I knew what to expect.I bought two large bottles. The seller shipped the package quickly, except that the cap on one of the bottles was loose, so the hot sauce leaked a little bit; otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars. But that won't stop me from buying from them again next time I run out.Highly recommend to those who want a little bit of heat, without having too much of a vinegar base."
2,Great sauce....if you have nothing else.,"Low quality and low flavor hot sauce....not all that hot either.If you need some hot sauce and have nothing else around, then this will do, but that there are so many other choices, this is the worst choice to make. Even regular tobasco sauce is much much better.I can only describe it as being similar to watery taco bell sauce.I would recommend Frontera Hot Sauce, Tobasco, or Cholula Hot sauce over this."
3,"Likable book, but limited for developing players","No question Mike Hebert has paid his dues. His style of coaching is very specific and introduces it well. As good as this book is at the big picture level, I didn't get much in the way of the many small adjustment tips that prove so valuable in developing players that are learning the game. I recommend Al Scates' book (""Winning Volleyball""?) and ""Karch Kiraly's Championship Volleyball"", by Karch Kiraly"
3,Korean battle scars build legal career,"A Kentucky judge's son is drafted into Marine service in Korea. Yearslater, as legal counsel to a prominent distillery firm, hesuccessfully battles a takeover attempt while remembering, andbenefitting from, the bloody battlefield agression of the front lines.The author's personal experiences take the reader to a few of thehaunts discussed in Hunter S. Thompson's stories of growing up inLouisville, a town supported by the making of whiskey and cigarettes.The vivid war scenes, told through flashbacks, give the story its mostenjoyable moments."
3,Interesting period piece,A Frenchman blackmails an English duke to introduce him into society to pursue an English beauty.Predictable storyline but interesting portrayals of both individuals and Regency English society mores.
1,smell so strong,I received the item on time but my dog could not get close to it because its strong chemical ordor..I put it in the Bleach water overnight but its smell still there..i am going to return it
2,Not what I wanted,"I was looking for a softer latex, squeaky ball. Nothing wrong with it, just not my dog's preference, your's may like it."
2,Doesn't stay put very well,"I liked the cushioning these mats provided, but, we used them for working out on our rugs and they moved around a LOT. Probably wouldn't buy again unless I am using it on a different surface."
4,Talent Meets Passion,"The highlight of Luka Bloom's ""Riverside"" is his uninhibited and impassioned acoustic guitar playing. ""Delirious,"" ""Over The Moon"" and ""You Couldn't Have Come At A Better Time"" are like a wild roller-coaster rides: Bloom yells, yups and chuckles while vigorousley pounding his guitar. On the love ballads (Dreams In America, Gone To Pablo) his gentle treatment of the strings is perfectly suited to the romantic lyrics.Bloom is also a captivating storyteller. ""The Man Is Alive"" is bittersweet father-son tale, and the pleading chorus of ""This Is For Life"" will make the hair on your arms stand on end. There are faint influences of Irish music here: ""An Irishman In Chinatown"" and ""You Couldn't Have Come At A Better Time"" are structured around the traditional jig. On ""The One,"" Bloom angrily scolds a fellow (unnamed) Irish musician who lost his life while pursuing his dreams.Not often enough does talent meet passion. ""Riverside"" is a notable exception."
3,good effort,"this is my fourth Luka album, after 'Turf','Keeper of the Flame', and 'Between the Mountain and the Moon', so I am definitely getting to hear his works out of order...no matter though..as this is a definite early gem. I absolutely love 'Delirious'..it gets me up with a smile in the mornings. The fact is, not many artists can get away (as another reviewer put it) yelping, yawping, (great word) and generally going off into impromptu tangents. It never feels stilted or predictable. Lovely. can't wait to get all of his albums-Amoeba, here I come."
4,A Complete Book,"After you finish this book you will swear that he did not also write his first great book The Berkut. This book is one that you need a lot of coffee and bright lights on to stay as attentive as you need to be (and want to be) to grasp the many sub plots and subtitle twists. This book is not a fast paced thriller, but a rather slow moving heavy book that you really can sink your teeth into to. This book is not heading to the movie screen any time soon due to its complexity. I think of his writing this, it is what Clancy would be like if he had a Masters in English Lit from Yale. If you are looking for this type of book then you should buy this book, if you are looking for something lighter then many Higgins is for you."
4,OK cheap frame.,"There is nothing particularly great about this license plate frame. It is cheap and plastic, but it comes as described. If it exceeded my expectations I would have given this frame 5 stars, but I got what I paid for, a cheap generic plastic license plate frame. I plan on using this on my front bumper and a nicer frame on the back bumper. I purchased the Baltimore Ravens frame."
4,"Sir, an erection is a flagpole on your grave","There is lots of silly humor and broad farce in the film accompanying this soundtrack, and I think composer Rachel Portman did a great job of capturing that, for example with the opening tracks on this CD. Some of the tracks are extremely repetitious therefore monotonous, and so, leave the impression that the music was written for the film only, with little or no thought given to the fact that it would be released as a CD soundtrack as well. But there are enough good tunes here for 4 stars, and it's definately worthwhile. I'm especially fond of Canzonetta (track 7), Daddy (track 10), Where the Spirits Soar (track 19), and Rigoletto (track 22). An added bonus and bit of hilarity is provided by the fact that between each track there are brief excerpts of dialogue from the movie that will make you laugh out loud :)))David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
2,The Road to Wellville Audio CD,"I ordered this CD, The Road to Wellville, because I like Rachel Portman's music - but this one is impossible for me to listen to. It's perhaps perfect when watching the movie, which is silly - but the music is just not for listening. Sometimes there are no samples to hear, so one takes a shot in the dark because of liking the artist. And, sometimes they disappoint."
5,Extremely fun soundtrack,"Light, funny and very enjoyable. Quirky sounds, melodies and instrumentation, combined with funny snippets of dialogue (usually a dreary addition to any OST) make this a worthy listen."
4,"Interesting, but good","I thought this book was very interesting. The ending was hard to understand, but that's what sequels are for. and I think the writer should write a sequel to this. It would make it interesting since there is so much more he could describe about the clock or the creatures or Uncle Marco."
3,Filler...,"This is the kind of book you need on a bus or train or during a winter day when you can't go out. It is stright forward, with stupid characters (as in slow to figure things out), semi-interesting alien race (who have class issues) and a creative idea that could have been handled better or made into an interesting series of books.I got this book because, when I was younger, I found Interstellar Pig interesting and thought the author might be able to write other books at the same level of skill. No go - while The Boxes feels like it had some promise I never really felt anybody was in danger nor was anything really a surprise."
4,Good but not as good,I have read all of William Sleator`s books and most of them are fantastic except intersteller pig and parasite pig but this was very close to being great but not as great as others such The Boy Who Couldn`t Die which was amazing but disappointing that its not at the kindle store but you should definitely order that online.
5,Good book,this book is about a girl (annine) is told to not open these 2 boxes but when she does weird things start to happen.
2,Not Up to Par,"When I picked out this book, I was expecting a fast- paced, fun to read, sci-fi adventure. While much of the plotline itself was interesting, I found that the book was extremely difficult to get into. The book bored me for the first four chapters until it finally got into the real plot. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book. I felt that it was just, to sum it up, not interesting enough."
4,Make a sequel!,"William Sleator's ""The Boxes"" is an entertaining, fast-paced book, but it leaves many questions unanswered, such as: Why does Uncle Marco go on all these trips? Why was Henry not affected by the slowdown? Mr. Sleator, please make a sequel to ""The Boxes""!!!"
3,The Boxes,"This book had so much going for it. It took to long to explane issues, and when issues where explaned they left some parts unanswered. I give credit to how much creativity and originality it had, even though the book was predictable. The Boxes was an ok book, a great book for a book report ( I read it for a book report)."
3,The Boxes,"I liked THE BOXES because it had a lot of suspense. This book is about Annie's uncle leaving 2 boxes with her while her uncle goes on a mysterious trip. Her uncle told her not to open the boxes but she couldn't stand not knowing what where in the 2 boxes. Annie tells her friend Henry about the boxes. 1 of the boxes where in the basement and the other box was in her closet. In the box that was in her closet there was a weird creature that they called the clock and it could make slowdowns for the creatures in the basement. Annie, Henry, and the creatures are the only ones that don't get caught in the slowdown but every one else gets caught in the slowdown. I liked this book because it had a lot of action and cliffhangers near the end. I recommend this book to people that like science fiction books.By Justin"

5,i simply loved this book!,i liked this book so much i eaven made a box creature out of lego and am working of the lord.
4,Great Mystery Books for Kids,William Sleator keeps you on the edge of your seat in this suspensful book! This is definitely a good book for kids who like science fiction.
