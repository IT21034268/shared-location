3,Clever story,"Given the characters, the book comes to a logical and surprising ending. The outcome illustrates the ease with which one can allign revenge with what is perceived as a moral right. The characters were well drawn although not the sort to elicit empathy. McEwan gives us insight into the mental gymnastics of composers and newspaper editors."
4,What Lies Beneath A Story Told,"Expertly crafted, musically poetic, paced just like a walk in the park on an autumn day.This story leaves you with deep philosophical questions that will continue to pester you for days."
3,"Good, but not as good as Enduring Love !",Ian McEwan once again provides evidence of very capable writing skills. This novel however does fall into the shadow of Enduring Love.
3,Film Treatment,"A fine story about despicable people that reads like a film treatment. With the proper actors and director, I'm sure we'll all enjoy the show. As a book, though, it's amusing but shallow."
2,Thin on credibility,"McEwan has written some good books - but unfortunately this is not one of them.The plot is somewhat overblown and pretentious, and the book itself is so brief that there isn't enough substance to enable a suspension of disbelief. In fact this feels like a fleshed-out sketch for a book that the author couldn't be bothered to write properly. I couldn't believe the praise it received compared to much better books of his. A big disappointment.I was a fan, but after reading this poor effort it was some time before I was able to read another of his books."
3,Disappointed,"Given the book is the winner of the Booker Prize (though almost a decade ago), I was looking forward to reading a masterpiece. Unfortunately, just as McEwan describes the lack of creativity and surprises in the final movement of Clive Linley's 'Millennial Symphony', its creation stalled by Vernon's setting the police on Clive for helping with an attempted rape case, I find the ending of the book awkward and far from reality. It's hard to believe how two long-standing friends can be driven by such intense hatred that they kill each other by mutual poisoning. The novel does twist and turn unexpectedly, but also unreasonably.To be fair to McEwan, a lot of the paragraphs about the inner feelings of Clive and Vernon are very well-written, and the whole book is entertaining till the improbable ending."
2,Disappointed,"The two other novels by Ian McEwan that I have read (Enduring Love, The Cement Garden) were books that I loved-compelling, engrossing, provocative, emotional. This book however was overblown, pretentious and unbelievable. I didn't care for either character, both were immature and unsympathetic. The premise was based on a series of events that would never, ever happen. The climax was predictable and unfulfilling. I think McEwan is an amazing writer, and I don't know how this book of all his novels won the Booker Prize."
2,Disappointing,"I like the way McEwan writes and his stories are usually fascinating in terms of the issues and morals that are explored; however I often find his characters soul-less, and none more so than here. This story covers loyalty, perceptions of others, euthanasia, social morality and societal obligation. The two main characters, here are Vernon and Clive, they are just not people I cared about and this made me sit back from the action and at times, lose interest in it. I found the ending of this predictable and anti-climatic. I wasn't left thinking about the plot, the characters or the questions it raised. Overall, it was a disappointing read."
2,City of sin,"Many words have been spoken about legalisation of eutanasia and death tourism in Netherlands,, many words have been spoken about sensationalist journalism, and may of them will be yet spoken, but pointing the obvious is not the kind of thing that something that pretends to be artistic should strive to do. Consider the weak presentation of characters, consider the plotline that has been seen in many B movies out there, though I must confess, in first few chapters of the book, philosophy outshines the mere plot, consider the ending adequate to some ""dark form"" of Barbara Cartland and you'll have in your hands something that received the Booker Prize for who knows what reason. We do have deep moral philosophy here, we do have macabre solution of ethical conflict, we do have even the satire, but what we don't have is writing talent and the ability to keep the reader occupied with it. You'll not miss the thing if you skip this one."
2,Average read,I read 'Amsterdam' because it was a prize winner! And I was disappointed. Characters and themes fall apart at times but the story goes on. Yes there is a story. But if there was a point beyond it I missed it. It is well written but an average read.
1,Why did this win an award? It was awful.,"The publisher's description of the book intrigued me. Knowing it had won an award, I thought it was a reasonably safe bet, so I ordered it. I am so very disappointed. There are 4 main characters - a dead woman of questionable morals (she's slept with everything that moves, but it's OK because she's ""a nice person"" ???), two of her ex-lovers (who are self-absorbed and mean-spirited), and a political figure who has a ""dirty little secret"". The writing, at some points, is good, but I just never found anything in any of the characters to make me care about what happens to them. And the ending, which is apparently supposed to be either a) profound or b) witty or c) both (?) had about as much fizz as a bottle of 7 up left open for a week."
2,Are You People on Crack?,"I simply can't fathom how a novel as terrible as this one could win the most prestigious literary award in the UK.Even at a scant 193 pages, I had to fight with myself to keep from trashing it completely by page 50. Ian McEwan did a fantastic job of of creating completely self-absorbed unsympathetic characters in a setting that is more bland that English cuisine.I found myself wishing that the opening scene was the funeral for ALL of the main characters and not just that dearly departed manipulator Molly Lane. It's just that awful!A friend of mine tells me that McEwan is really truly talented (in spite of AMSTERDAM) and that the Booker Prize is always awarded one book late. Maybe if I'm feeling brave I'll buy ENDURING LOVE but don't count on it anytime soon!"
2,"Not a prize winner, for sure","This is a poor, contrived little book that appears to intentionally keep the reader distanced from the characters. Unfortunately, style has triumphed over content.The plot moves along at a reasonable pace in the first half, leaving the reader feeling vaguely satisfied, but the final fifty pages are dreadful. There simply isn't enough depth of characterisation to make us care in the slightest about the two main individuals and to sympathise with their predicaments. The final chapter is painful. Maybe, like one of his characters, Ian McEwan was running out of time.I fail to see any reason why `Amsterdam' should have won the 1998 Booker Prize. For me, it passed a few hours on a long train journey but don't expect anything deep and meaningful; you'll not find it here."
3,Clinton's scandal with Monica is probably the muse for this,"This has to be the Consolation Booker's Prize. It is definitely lightweight compared to other winners. The part that the book discusses that interests me tremendously is the media's dilemma of reporting, uncovering news versus the moral implication of it all. And is our current society really a compassionate one or one that merely suffers a low morality and chooses to overlook moral lapses saying it's not right to intrude into other people's private life. McEwan's book draws many parallels from the Clinton scandal - down to the televised part when Clinton and his family retreated to Martha's vineyard after his confession that he did have ""inappropriate"" behavior with Monica and McEwan's Garmony retreating to the countryside with his family. All in all, this is more an entertaining book with social commentary and observations than a literary book."
2,Induldgent uninteresting characters following obvious plot,"After all the hype I was surprised at how disappointing this book was. It doesn't really evoke any special time, place or characters. Thank god it was short or I would have felt really betrayed."
2,"Strong attempt, poor execution","This is not a put down on the Booker winner, but this book simply didn't work for me. It could have, the idea was right, but the twists were contrived, the ending bland, and the action unreal. The social commentary tried to work, but when things aren't real, how could it?"
3,Entertaining but surely not worth a Booker Prize,"This is an entertaining book, I read it from cover to cover and enjoyed it. The ending is very contrived and simply doesn't work. The description of the creative process and life in Grub street is very well done. Like another reviewer I can't belive this won a Booker prize.I reread this book a few years after writing the above. First of all I didn't remember reading it the first time which indicates that the book is throw away light (assuming I am not going senile). The plot is really creaky and for McEwen it is very weak. I think he tried to write a black comedy but it is not that funny - Its a bit like reading a David Lodge who is in a depressive state...."
1,Hardly up to Booker standard!,"Come on, a Booker award winner??? This book makes a mockery of the entire selection system. It was a self absorbed negitive short story, and nothing more. I can hardly believe this 'novel' was seen as matching the standards of The Famished Road or Midnight's children."
3,"Wonderful Style, Great Characterization, But Uninteresting Story","Long ago I read a book by this author called The Cement Garden. While he was more than talented with mechanics and style, I found his content perverse and distasteful.However, he is widely respected and so I thought it beneficial to give him another chance. I chose Amsterdam as my opportunity to get reacquainted with McEwan, mostly because it's a very short read and I didn't want to invest too much time with it.Well, I was very pleased to see that The Cement Garden must have simply been the author pushing the limit and not necessarily his norm. I enjoyed Amsterdam, though I don't think I would recommend it to the casual reader. The story, while not terribly captivating, was an interesting character study and, again, McEwan is very proficient with the written word. His style and structures are a joy to study.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"
2,Too many unanswered questions.,"This book was very odd. The story begins with the death of Molly. Molly who was the friend of several men, and the lover of several others even though she was married. Two of her previous lovers, Clive and Vernon, attend the funeral and pay their respects. Then they go off and continue to live their lives, but they have both been changed as a result of the loss of their mutual friend. I am still trying to figure out what the plot was. Is jealousy the main theme or friendship gone array? Is it the continuation of life after the death of someone very close? Life that follows a dismal path. I don't have the answer to these questions. I found the writing to be a bit too wordy. I also found the ideas to be choppy and scattered. This is the first McEwan book I have read and I have to say, I am not impressed."
4,Profoundly Well Done,"This is my first book by Ian Mcewan and I was utterly blown away by it. It is simply extraordinary how lucidly this writer can convey experiences through words. He does something which absolutely cannot be accomplished through most narrative styles and cinema and truly places quality literature in it's appropriate acclaim. The book reads as smoothly as if you were observing a movie, only through the perspective of psychological omniscience. It is in part an exploration of the the paradoxical nature of morality, and an often amusing indictment of the modern world. I have ordered three other Mcewan books already after reading this."
1,Nothing to like,"Characters one cannot identify with, a fantasy-kind of society, and a really stupid denouement. Honestly, there's a lot better things to be said about love, death, and euthanasia, and almost anyone can *say* it better than it's said here."
2,AMSTERDAM,"Well, I have to concur with the mind-set of many of the previous reviewers...THIS, slow-paced novella won a prestigious award? Really? Why?To each its own, I guess. Read it and judge for yourself. Indisputably, there are those who saw brilliancy here. Not me."
2,Not Really Worth The Effort,"Sure, it won the Booker prize, or the writer did -- whatever: the best thing I can say about this is a) I liked the ending and b) I wish it hadn't taken quite so long to get to it. Would have made a great novella."
2,lacking,"I decided to read this book after reading McEwan's newer book, Atonement, which I liked. But I didn't like Amsterdam much at all. It seemed disjointed somehow. There was no character development and the central person that ties the rest of the characters together is dead before the book even starts. It's a very strange story that seems lacking somehow. I couldn't quite get my brain around this one."
1,Ugly,"I don't understand Ian McEwan's reputation as a great writer. I found him just plain nasty, and it's not because I didn't 'get' the humor. I did, it just didn't move me. In this novel, McEwan uses a female character as a literary device. It's demeaning, and it doesn't get any better. I do not recommend ""Amsterdam."""
4,Amsterdam,The depth of each of Ian McEwan's characters in his novel Amsterdam is what keeps the reader intrigued. In this novel one wonders how each one is going to finally resolve his issues.
2,No prize winner,"It is disappointing to read a novella by a man who surely can write, but who fails to use his skills as a writer or a story teller. The thin outline of this book provides a healthy skeleton which could be fleshed out nicely by an able writer. McEwan is doubtless an able writer. But this book never moves below the surface, and it pivots to an inherently unbelievable outcome. It is understandable that two lifelong friends, reacting to the sudden medical breakdown and death of a friend, could enter a mutual euthanasia pact: don't let that happen to me; I would rather die, and I want you to help me if I am unable to do so myself. Pre-Alzheimer's patients might have such thoughts. But McEwan suspends logic, and compassion, to foist onto us double deaths ostensibly fulfilling the pact-- when the facts reflect only the pique of two grumpy, disappointed almost-old men who end up murdering each other. Not a good story, not well enough told-- a swing and a big miss."
3,An implausible plot,"McEwan's prose is muscular and rich. But the plot is either implausible or, alternatively, the characters flawed to a level where I just didn't care."
2,Amsterdam---a disappointment,"McEwan is a master at letting us into the minds and hearts of the creative and successful upper middle and upper classes of British society. He does a marvelous job of this in Amsterdam for the first 80% of this brief novel. However, the novel rushes foolishly toward its ending once the two main characters actually leave the U.K. and go off to Amsterdam. I got the feeling that the author was in a quandary as to end the novel and so he chose a rather silly and cliched ending more in keeping with Agatha Christie than the beautifully nuanced writer that McEwan can be. Read ""Saturday"" or ""On Chesil Beach"" but leave Amsterdam in Europe."
4,Very enjoyable!,I thought this was a very enjoyable and interesting book. Quite funny actually. The author tells the story in a concise 193 pages. He could have dragged the story on for another 200 pages like some authors do but he knew where he was going with the characters and how to get there. I will be reading more of McEwan's work.
2,Stylish and concise,"It's always a pleasure to see such a concisely written modern English novel, while many people tend to mistakenly consider that any worth-reading novel should be thickly written and complicated.But I cannot really appreciate this novel, as this novel looks like Kundera's novels too much. Frequent use of musical terms, explicit sexual descriptions, liberal-minded characters, and so on. In that sense, I cannot understand why this novel took the Booker Prize, as this novel lacks originality."
2,Major disappointment,"Beautifully written, carefully observed...and the whole thing is a setup for an (literally) unbelievably stupid joke. I can only conclude that the Booker prize committee awarded McEwan the prize for this novel to make up for overlooking his previous work. A major disappointment from this extremely talented writer. Check out ""The Innocent"" or ""Black Dogs"" instead."
2,Disappointing and ultimately absurd,"Although I greatly enjoyed Enduring Love by McEwan, I found this novel to be quite disappointing. Amersterdam tells the tale of how the death of a woman sends three friends of the deceased, a politician, a journalist, and a composer, into a bizarre spiral of changing relationships. The characters were never completely real and the story was never fully engaging. The ending of the book struck me as so absurd as to be laughable. This book has certainly received high praise elsewhere, so maybe it's just me, but I will not be recommending this book to anyone."
2,"Intriguing beginning, ending a letdown","I really enjoyed the first 7/8 of this book but could not believe the climax, which if it didn't exactly come out of left field, was wholly unsupported by the plot development. I was left scratching my head why this book received such accolades. Read Enduring Love for a better portrait of the author's talents."
2,Blandsterdam,"Having just gone on a two week Ian McEwan jag, reading ""Saturday,"" ""On Chesil Beach"" and ""Amsterdam"" in rapid succession, I would warn any McEwan first-timers to read something else first. I thought ""Saturday"" was a terrific fast-paced novel of ideas. I thought ""On Chesil Beach"" was engaging and charming, if a little heavy handed. I just thought ""Amsterdam"" was boring. It's not humorous enough to be funny, not smart enough to be thought-provoking and not suspenseful enough to be gripping.It's a banal character study of two professionally-successful narcissists that ends with a strange but not quite believable twist.Amsterdam is a short, quick trip but doesn't really take you anywhere."
3,Elevated Expectations,"I may have been disappointed in this short book because the reviews and descriptions raised my expectations. Maybe I find the portrayal of ultra conservative politicians as having sexually deviant secrets a little trite and overdone and the buildup to the exposure in the press predictable. Unlike some other reviewers I really liked the ""ironic?"" ending and felt that its description was gripping and fit the cynical world view of betrayal. All the characters in the book belonged to a certain class and I do not know if this added or detracted.(Perhaps they had all gone to Tom Wolfe's fictional Dupont Univ.!?)"
3,Interesting but not a masterpiece,"I have to agree with other reviewers that this book was interesting but flawed. It did not flesh out Clive and Vernon as would be needed. But the major problem is that the most interesting person, Georges, is only hinted at, at the very end. I wished he would have been introduced a bit more properly.Still a goor read but by no means equal to Atonement."
3,Booker?,"This book won the 1998 Booker prize. When I picked up this book I was expecting a lot – I was expecting something profound, something that would make me ponder life long after I put the book down. I have to say, I was disappointed. The story was simple, entertaining and very clever; but profound it was not.The two main characters in the story are Vernon Halliday, an editor for a struggling newspaper, and Clive Linley, a semi-famous composer on the brink of his life’s masterpiece. Clive and Vernon are old friends even though they have nothing in common besides each being a former lover of the deceased Molly Lane. In the span of the novel, both characters face a major moral dilemma, and in the end, each judges the other for their actions.Perhaps my expectations were unfair, based simply on the Booker seal of approval plastered on the cover. Or perhaps it just didn’t deserve the Booker in the first place."
3,"Good read, but maybe not a Booker winner","This was my first read of a work by Ian McEwan. I am now about to try another, only because I hope that what I'd heard is right, and that his previous work is more accomplished!This is a quick and interesting read. It has a good plot, yet the character development felt shallow to me. I never really felt like I was being drawn into the story, but rather a distant observer. I didn't sympathize with anyone, but read the book to find out what happened. I will try another by him to confirm that he's Booker-worthy for previous works!"
3,Disappointing for a Booker winner.,"This is my first read of McEwan. Booker winners have been my guidepost in the past, but this is a sad disappointment, both as prize winner and novella. Once I had begun to swim in the plot, the most jarring deficiency was McEwan's apparent lack of interest in the details of the principals and their friendships. It seemed he was racing to a conclusion - perhaps to finish in time for the Booker deadline?"
5,Fantasstic!,"The professional reviews included on this page miss many points of this novel, including a simple but factual description. The history of Molly, Clive and Vernon is one of old, old friendships. Whatever else once existed, what remained was a closeness that allowed each to take the other as they were - without judgement. Molly was the key to the friendship and without Molly the friendship dissolved. This is an interesting story about slightly off center but real people who sometimes think one way but act another, and sometimes rationalize behavior to make it more acceptable - even to themselves."
2,Don't bother reading this book unless you have a lot of time,"This book was very boring unless you're into composers and very familiar with movements, symphonies, etc. Also, I found that I had to read almost half the book to really understand and define the characters. The premise at the end that the two would actually be clever enough for each to give the other poison and kill each other was absolutely absurd. This is the first McEwan work I've read and I'm not sure I'll read another."
2,"starts slowly, ends badly","Because it was a Booker Prize winner and short, I slogged along wondering when something worthy of the effort would happen. The plot did finally pick up at about 100 pages but this burst of energy only led to a silly ending. Some of the writing was beautiful, especially about the musical passages. But it was hard not to feel that this was anything more than McCewan showing off that he was a intellectual to be reckoned with."
2,Can't believe it won the Booker Prize,"Yes, this book was an enjoyable read - but winner of the Booker Prize? You must be joking! 'Enduring Love'would have been more deserving but still not in the league of other winners."
2,Not that pleasant,"I don't like to write bad reviews, so I will just tell you that this book was not so entertaining. The story is miserable."
2,Why an award?,"I don't understand why this book won an award. In an effort to find ""good"" reading material I have turned to award winning titles. In this case I was disappointed. The book lacked depth and character development. The plot, if I may so generously call it, was weak. Good thing it was a short novel or I probably would not have made it to the end."
5,Excellent,"I read this book entirely on a rainy sunday afternoon. I could not put it down. The book is mesmerizing,with a bizare ending. The book was amazing how something that seems so good so right,just turns around and bites you. If this is Ian's least favored book,then I must get the rest."
2,"Very, very thin (in many senses of the term)","McEwan is a talented writer, but this work is a decidedly minor effort--and its winning the Booker is an utter puzzlement. It's a very plot-driven piece (though at less than 200 pages, with enormous font size, it is more of a novella than a novel--and not worth the expensive price), but the characters seem very thin indeed. It's hard to care much about a morality tale when the characters are so thoroughly dislikable. With their elite educations, glamorous occupations, clever bitchery, and self-aggrandizing behavior, Clive and Vernon seem to have stepped out of a P. D. James novel--unfortunately, there's no Inspector Dagliesh around to provide any sort of moral compass (or real suspense)."
1,Hard to get through,"Although I usually enjoy reading Ian McEwan, I found it difficult to get through this book despite its short text. I found the description of Clive's musical composition drawn out. The symmetry of the characters is broken towards the end, in that we only know about Clive's thoughts regarding revenge. I guess this is to surprise the audience when we learn of Vernon's revenge as well. However, it makes the ending unbalanced as if it was just thrown together. I would have also liked a more detailed explanation of Amsterdam's euthanasia laws as I didn't understand the characters to be elderly."
2,Well-crafted...but so what?,"Amsterdam is a quick read and you won't be angry that you wasted your time; however, you might be angry it won the Booker Prize. Briefly, McEwan tells his (rather uncomplicated and rather unamazing) story very well, very precisely, never wasting a word. However, at the end, the reader can only ask a quick question: Who cares? Ian McEwan is a superb craftsman, there's no doubt about it...but the problem is, with Amsterdam, it's ALL craft and nothing more. You'll feel, once your done, that you've been staring at a piece of furniture for hours, because this book is, ultimately, incredibly forgettable and unimportant. Surely, there must have been a better book the year this won the Booker???"
1,disappointed,"The plot seems made up ahead of time in outline, then filled in thinly. None of the characters is sympathetic. A disappointment, and a waste of time."
2,Amsterdam,I haven't finished the book and it's a very short novel. I should have read more reviews before I bought it. Not what I thought it would be.
2,"Trying so hard to be an ""intellectual"" novel","Ian McEwan seems to be one of those authors who are assumed to be literary but who offer little in style or substance. As with the later -Saturday-, McEwan gives us a collection of terribly interesting, or, rather, terribly self-impressed, iconoclasts - perhaps best understood as an exercise in wish-fulfilment by the author: see just how fascinating my characters (and by implication, I myself) must be! The only difficulty, beyond the desperate energy behind each of these so very contrived characters, is that the plot and writing style can't then cope either. The result is a bit like one of those rag-rolled, sponge-painted, hand-marbled paint finishes - lots of visible effort and self-expression and yet not only not worth looking at, but painfully overwrought."
3,"Well crafted, a bit cold","McEwan knows how to construct a story - he richly focuses on small moments in his tale and insightfully removes pieces other authors would find the need to write about. It's one of those books that helped me write better just by reading it.On the downside, I didn't buy the motivation behind the characters and felt the book's stark construction left me cold.I've heard his other work is much different - he obviously talented, so I'll read more of him for sure."
4,Beautiful Words,"A beautifully written book about four fascinating baby-boomers. A politician, a newspaper editor, a composer and George (whose occupation is not quite clear.)Richly descriptive words on the creative process of a musician are the best I have ever read. So is the image of a man lying naked in his bed contemplating intercourse with his wife, girlfriend or masturbation. All evolving around a tight storyline about men's ambition, jealousy, conceit and death.Although brief, I truly enjoyed reading each word by word."
2,This won the Booker Prize?,"This isn't a bad book; it's short, well-written, and the story moves along at a brisk pace. It's not a _good_ book, either. The characters, while well developed in terms of ""quirks,"" never seem anything more than puppets used to advance the plot- a plot that, while moderately clever, never seems anything more than a way of getting to an ending that doesn't mean a whole lot. The fact that this won the Booker Prize is somewhat distressing. I haven't read much of McEwan's work, but The Cement Garden is immeasurably superior to this novel. All in all, Atonement is a light bit of darkness that received far more attention than it deserved. You read it once, you don't need to go back to it."
2,not good enough for any prize let alone booker,"I wanted to get into Mcewan. This is a slim novel and received a Booker, so I thought this will get me hooked on Mcewan if he's half as good as his reputation. The novel was good enough but not kind of novel that makes me want to read everything by the author like Amis's Money, Rushdie's Satanic Verses, Kundra's The Joke,...I could have given it three stars if the expectation weren't so high."
3,seems like the Reader's Digest version of a great book,"'Amsterdam' has to be one of worst books to win the Booker prize. Ian McEwan has written much, much better. What I found frustrating is that despite its shortfalls the overall plot is excellent. And the author raises some very interesting social issues in a very interesting framework. However I thought the ""two former lovers of a decent woman bond in a manly way"" aspect was a bit of a rip-off of 'The End Of The Affair' (Graham Greene) and, most unfortunately, the author doesn't dig enough into the characters and covers certain aspects of the plot in a cursory fashion. The entire book felt half-hearted, as if McEwan simply rushed through it to achieve a deadline.Bottom line: it has all the basics for being a great book but McEwan blew it. Not recommended."
3,Defeated by its own conclusion,"A composer and a newspaper editor become locked in conflict when a former lover dies even as they both face failure in their professional lives. Ian McEwan writes beautifully about these morally compromised men who find themselves failing miserably at every tribulation that life sends their way, thereby intensifying their disappointment and disapproval of each other. However, he derails his own story in the end; after displaying such astute psychological understanding of his characters, he forces them to participate in a very unconvincing resolution. It's as if he had the conclusion in mind right from the beginning and refused to listen to his characters when they told him they didn't want to go there."
3,Solid,"This is a short novel by any standards and the last twenty pages could have been 60-80 easily, but I applaud McEwan's convictions in keeping it brief. Minimal waffle. In, out and put the kettle on style writing.After reading about half I was thinking the author had bashed this out hoping it would be turned into a drama of some sort. But on completion in conclusion it's a bit more than that. It's a bit of a commentary on a certain class of English society.Couldn't help thinking the scenes where the characters are in bed is a direct correlation to how the writer feels at times. Too good/honest to be fiction."
3,Brilliant writing...wasted?,"This was my introduction to Ian McEwan's fiction. I enjoyed it very much until I was close to the end. I'm not sure I have the 'mot juste' for my sense of its ending but ""ridiculous"" is a start. I'd love to know why McEwan ended it the way he did...perhaps there's a way to find out. Did he have a brilliant idea about how to end it that had not quite crystallized when an upsetting conversation with a friend ruined things? Those who've read the novel will get the reference here. In any case, apart from this not insignificant problem this is a compelling read by a fine writer whose acquaintance I'm pleased to have made."
4,Excellent writing; clever plot,"This book had the subtly lacking in so much of today's middlebrow, popular fiction. The characters were well defined, their mid-life crises interesting. I enjoyed it and laughed at the clever outcome. I agree with other Amazon reviewers that the end is a bit contrived, but I prefer to think of it as ""neat."" Ian McEwan's books all concern moral issues. They are excellent, too. Try ""The Innocent"" for a thrill."
3,"Not quite ""Enduring Love""","Like the reader from Amsterdam, I liked ""Enduring Love"" better. Even though ""Amsterdam"" is brilliantly written (this is why it won the Booker, and why I read it straight through in two sittings.) it takes place in more of a Iris Murdoch meets Weekly World News fantasy world, and the characters conspicuouly lack integrity. (Which makes it fun.) ""Enduring Love"" is grounded in reality and spectacularly plotted, with a central hero that we're not really sure about until the very end, and a true cliffhanger of an ending."
2,Not Booker prize material,"The author twists a plot about love and revenge, but gets tangled in it's web. Mr McEwan must have used a writing program, as the structure is so smooth you could skate on it. But that's all this book has to offer.The characters have personalities of cardboard cutouts. They are stiff and forced and I didn't develop empathy for any of them.If this book was a painting, it would be black and white."
3,Beautiful writing of a lame story,"Ian McEwan has not disappointed me ever with his writing. This was the third book that I read by this talented author. Unfortunately I have been disappointed every time by his stories. Amsterdam was the worst of the three (Saturday and Atonement were the other two that I have read). Interestingly enough this is the one that won the booker. McEwan has an amazing skill of building suspense. I have been disappointed every time by how the story progresses and ends.Amsterdam takes a Hollywood turn and simply becomes unbelievable by the end. It is as if he wants to dazzle the reader by the end but that is not his strength. McEwan's greatest strength is his writing and not his plot development. He is one of the finest authors - if only he could come up with better ideas for his books. Atonement is the best book of his that I have read so far. If you are new to McEwan, I would skip Amsterdam for now."
3,Witty Short Novel,"Several reviewers have compared this book to the work of Evelyn Waugh and this is apt. In common with some of Waugh's novels, notably books like Vile Bodies and A Handful of Dust, this is bitterly ironic social comedy. Perhaps most similar to A Handful of Dust, Amsterdam is a savagely witty commentary on the British equivalent of the Baby Boomers, or at least their more intellectual and privileged strata. In events precipitated by the unexpected death of an old friend (and former mutual lover), two old friends and a common adversary confront moral choices and fail miserably to meet the challenge. Their failings are a result partly of efforts to recover some of their youthful idealism, and due partly to incredible self-absorption. This book is distinguished from Waugh's work by McEwan's ability to describe much more believeable characters. Very well written."
4,"Gripping, yet a little light","This book is fascinating and kept me reading non-stop. McEwan's writing style is simply brilliant. He has a gift to capture the reader. Not only that, this tale about a deteriorating friendship is cleverly engineered with an enrapturing build up to its striking climax. This social satire reminds me of parts from Ayn Rand's Fountainhead.However, for a briliant writer, I can only say that this book seems like an exercise for him. This novel seemed a bit short and unfulfilling, somehow. It does seem more like a short story than a novel."
2,"lightweight, not Booker material as I understand criteria","I'm disappointed. Although there are things to like in the book: the part on the pleasures of hiking, the discussion of romantic vs. classic view of nature, the anthropomorphic airplane metaphor, most of it is blousy, especially the music discussions. If this is a colossal British joke about form following function in which the book is like the millenium symphony, spare me. It's not that funny and I don't have time to read tripe that knows it's tripe. If the book is intentionally sloppy then the author and the Booker judges owe us a apology and refund, if unintentional, well, we all have an off day or dash off something for fun that doesn't work. I'm just sorry I got stung along with several friends I recommended it to."
2,Grossly over-rated,"This is a minor--and apparently, casual--novella by an author of some very good novels. It is hard to know why it was awarded the Booker Prize. Perhaps it was to prevent the prize from going to another nominee or possibly it was made in order to reward McEwan for past performances."
2,Couldn't this writerly talent be put to better use?,"So much for seeking out a prizewinning novel! I would not have read Amsterdam had it not won the Booker, and now I'm not likely to seek out other McEwan books. Deftly written, but fundamentally unpleasant. My reading time is too limited to spend it on a witty trifle that leaves a distinctly bitter aftertaste."
1,"Thin, empty, and an impostor.","I have read other winners of the Booker Prize, and have found them to be rewarding and stimulating. This novel is an imposter with no place in that category. It reads like the outline of a story and certainly not a complete novel. The plot is drawn too thinly, as is every character, situation, and location. But in the end, no rational justification is established for the double murder of the two main characters. A snit between two middle-aged men that leads to mutual murder could provide a rich territory for exploration. Here, the opportunity is completely lost. ""Amsterdam"" is not even a good read in a lonely airport. A thin, empty, waste of time."
2,"A little too ""crafted""","Ian McEwan is a very good writer, this just does not happen to be a very good book. The writing is crisp and sparse, just as I was told by the friend who loaned it to me, but the plot is so threadbare that I found the ending to be broadcast well in advance of when it should have been. I know that this style of story can work, it just doesn't here. Theoretically, you're supposed to get to the end of the book and not be able to believe that you read right past the clues that you needed. Unfortunately, this book is so sparse that the plot elements all point to the same culminative moment. 'Twas a pity because I expected more out of a Booker Prize winner. I guess what they say is true, you always win prizes one book too late."
2,"Close, but no cigar...","This is the third Booker Prize winning book I have read and I have come to the conclusion, the Booker Prize means nothing. The book was engaging, the dialogue terrific at times and then the story hung on thin threads of vapid characterization and stereotypes. The unethical, two-faced politician, the FLEA like journalist and the eccentric musician. We have met these stereotypes before and meeting them again in Amsterdam, didn't quite impress me. It was a mediocre book, that can be enjoyed if your bookshelf is empty and there is a snowstorm outside that will not allow you to go out and buy a GOOD book. In any case, borrow it from someone -- don't waste your money on the Booker Prize hype."
4,"Nice, Sturdy and Stylish Valet","These valets are nice, sturdy thick acrylic that looks great. Larger 6-compartment valet wasn't wrapped in plastic like the smaller 4-compartment valet (which would have been nice), but it still had the cardboard sleeve that protected all but the short sides, and Amazon packaged it well, so quite satisfactory if not absolutely ideal."
5,He's Never Lost It !!!,"I saw this video on sale at a local store before it was available on Amazon.com... I thought to myself.. there must be a reason it's on sale. Why so cheap!? After purchasing it and watching it numerous times, I still cannot answer that question. I only regret not buying it sooner! This is a fabulous DVD. It not only shows smokey being personal with the audience, but you get a sense of the man behind the great song library. (Did you know he wrote ALL those songs?) He's really incredible... If anything he's gotten better with age. If you are the slightest fan of his, make sure you pick this up and add it to your collection. I'm sure you won't regret it. I still enjoy putting it on as I work around the house and find I sit down and watch certain cuts over and over again. Watch how he handles the jealous boyfriend in the audience. And he does it without making anybody angry. The man is SMMMMoooooooth!"
3,Where's the beef?,"I have been blessed to see Smokey live on a number of occasions and this show does little to expose the real Smokey. If you just love Smokey then buy it, otherwise settle for the cd."
4,CLASSIC SMOKEY!,"First let me say, that most of the DVD concerts offered of Old School classic artists are either of very poor quality or show the artists performing a lousy set of song selctions. I know because I collect DVD concerts whenever I can find good ones. Unfortunately, Amazon often fails to list the songs performed on a specific DVD, making it more difficult to select a good concert. This DVD is the exception. Smokey is on top of his game and at his best in this concert! Additionally, he performs some of his greatest hits, some of which he has not performed in a long time. As a bonus he performs some more recent songs which are in the classic Smokey style and tradition!...All Smokey fans must get this DVD!"
2,Past the Torch,"Smokey is one of Motown's Great singers, However in this live concert Smokey needs to give it up and past the torch. I know he is older but he can not hit the notes anymore.www.misguidedproduction.com"
3,Excellent read even if none of the stories are Tolkien-like.,"I found all of the stories well written and enjoyable, but then I did not assume that they would be done in a Tolkien-like writing style or would be based on Tolkien's works. If you are looking for stories that are reminiscient of Tolkien's Middle Earth, you will be sorely dissapointed. If you are looking for an tome of enjoyable fantasy fiction (that sometimes borders on science fiction) you will like this collection. The fact that the stories (although very good) did not live up to the title of the book prompted me to give it three stars rather than four. Caveat Emptor."
3,Cheap use of the Tolkien moniker; A marketing tool.,"Short stories whose quality varies tremendously. Certainly none of the stories ranks as an all time classic. Worse, the connection to Tolkien's works is vague at best... ""Authors writing in their own distinctive style but still somehow being evocative of J.R.R.""? Please! That is a lame pretense. This book is clearly a marketing ploy. It serves the same purpose as the Amazon.com lines reading ""If you've read this book, you might enjoy..."" Only, to their credit, Amazon.com is straightforward about it."
5,Carry it everywhere,"As other reviewers have said, these stories are not Tolkein-esque. They are, however, a fine example of Tolkien's LEGACY. DeLint and Bull write stories with a subtly of prose which gives me shivers. I have read these storiezs aloud to friends over the phone. If you are a fan of fantasy, then read this collection. It is the book I take when I don't want to pack a lot of books but still want a diverse read on trips. Thank you, Tolkein (and MAcDonald) for making modern fantasy possible."
5,Revolutionary Strategy Applicable Today,By Any Means Necessary consists of lectures (including responses to audience questions) as well as interviews by reporters both hostile and friendly.Malcom's revolutionary strategy for confronting and overcoming the oppression of African-Americans in the 1960s is applicable today for the working class and oppressed people everywhere.
2,Imagination,"The real history book on the Maid of Ludmir has since been written by Nathaniel Deutsch - highly recommended. Rabbi Winkler's book may be entertaining (I don't think, in fairness, he intended it to be regarded as history), but it should not be taken as telling the real story of this strange womean."
1,SUBSTITUTED ITEM BAD BUSINESS,This company is horrible. I purchased a certain type of Peroxyl and they substituted it with a Canker and Sore version which is not my problem. I wanted the regular mouth rince. Yhis is a bad way of doing business.
4,I LOVE it!,I received this camera for Christmas and I've enjoyed it throughly. Takes great pictures and it's very easy to use. I also agree with other posts that it eats batteries really fast. That's why rechargables were invented!
2,Don't Like It,"I've had many problems taking pics in the autofocus mode: many, many pics are not sharply focused, even in good lighting situations. In low light, forget it hardly anything turns out well. Also, the flash tends to make many pics too bright with skin tones looking washed out. Also, if there is a white object in your field of view the resulting image usually shows a white blotch with hardly enough detail to make out what the object is. Also, the video mode feature is arbitrarily limite to 60 seconds rather than being limited by the size of memory card; so even if you have 256k memory, you still can only take a 60 second video. VERY disappointed."
2,S304 - Problems with Focus and Large Memory Cards,"I've had the s304 for about 3 weeks and so far it's been quite disapointing. It has problems focusing in low-light conditions, leading to blurred pictures. I also purchased a no-name 256 meg flash card that the camera refuses to recognize. Though the other 3 or 4 camera's I've tried the card in, all recognize it just fine. Even using the supplied memory card often take 2 or 3 attempts turning the camera on and off before it recognizes it.This wasn't one of my better purchases."
1,Dimage S304 3.2M,I had the EXACT same experience as the Feb. 16 2004 reviewer! The only difference is that my Dimage had to be sent back to the factory straight from the box because it was filled with fine lint like particles. It NEVER has worked properly.....I will never purchase a Minolta anything! ever! and I'll tell all my friends....
4,Looks Great,"It doesn't have the rear trunk in the fender. That is OK though, but now I don't want to put these beauties on my ATC because I don't want to scratch them up! LOL..."
4,"Good product,","This is a good video to learn pilates techniques. However, I think it was a little too expensive for what you get. After just viewing the video twice, I had all the moves memorized."
2,"Ho hum. ""That's it?"" I asked when workout was finished","I received this kit in a big box in the mail. I opened to find another box. I opened that box and found the three bands and the dvd in a cheap paper casing. I thought, ""Did they spend all the money on the box the kit came in?"" The workout is okay, but I could return this and never miss it. Would much prefer doing Marisa Tomei's workout for a workout that was 100% more effective or if I was going to choose a totally different workout I'd pick Kathy Smith's kettle bell workout. To me this wasn't a workout. It was a bunch of stretches."
2,Shit Jobs for Rock,"The radio station at my school has like over 200 cassette singles for Jaya the Cat's Basement Style album and nobody takes them because the music is absolutely wretched. I've listened to the two songs at least three times and I've wanted to kill myself even more with each successive listen.Maybe it's just that these two songs are bad and the rest of the album rocks as the other reviewers say.But maybe the other reviewers are all in the band. Just a hypothesis.I could be wrong, but the five or six people I know who were daring enough to listen to the Jaya the Cat cassette were as horrified as I was.Goodnight, and please don't listen to crappy music. Unless it's your own band, which I think is the case here."
4,Excellent but out of print book,"it's been thirteen years since maximum rpm & seven years since this book but it's still relevant for anyone running RHEL 5 or CentOS 5. if you absolutely need a hard copy version of this book don't hesitate to buy it here. i'm not going to go into the details as to why, the other reviewers have done a great job.if you don't feel like shelling out $60+ for a $20 book just google the book's title, it's been published on the web by the author."
5,Excellent engineering and production work!,"The production on this album was incredible! Tim Gerron is an excellent engineer! Check out other albums Tim has worked on including The Skate Nigs, Skrew and Terminal 46!Austin, Texas"
1,too watery,it is too watery. It ran down my drawer and left marks every where of the runs. I had to buy a different paint. what a waste of money.
1,Terrible,"This is absolutely the worst Latex paint I have ever used.It was like water in the can. Stirred and stirred and still didn't help much. The coverage was terrible.3 coats and still looks terrible. Yes, I primed the wood before I used this.Try 1 more coat and if it isn't any better,throw the project away and start over. I only use high quality brushes,which is what the can suggested.Will never buy this paint again!Some suggested that I got a bad can.I did not get it from Amazon,maybe that's the problem, always been happy with Amazon. I am not willing to take the gamble on this paint!"
4,good paint,"ordered 2 cans because i couldn't find it in stock at any local stores near my house and wanted to buy the same paint to match an existing piece i already had painted. one can arrived with quite a large dent in it, but not leaking and i just used that one first. love the color."
4,Great Value Tea Maker,"I drink a pitcher of tea a day and LOVE this tea maker! It is quick and convenient to use with excellent tea strength. I also like the elongated smaller shape of the pitcher which fits in the frig without taking up too much space. Having used my father's Mr. Coffee tea maker, this one is far easier, faster and more convenient. The one and only drawback is that I am now purchasing my fourth tea maker in 5 years because the motor and internal workings wear out within about a year since I use it so often! No problem, though, since the price is so reasonable. This way I always have spare pitchers on hand!"
2,"weak tea, small amount","no matter how much tea i put in and even at the highest strength, the tea still brews weak and only makes 1/4 pitcher"
4,wonderful with only a few drawbacks,"We bought this a few months ago and use it almost daily. We love it. It is so easy to use. I only gave four stars because there are a few things that I feel could make it perfect.Although we leave it out because we use it so much, it would be hard to store if we aren't using it. They say that the pitcher goes over the tower for easy storage. This is true BUT you still have the lid, filter & inside compartment to find a place to keep so it is no longer all together. So when not in use we leave it set up.Also, the end of the pitcher is open so you need to be careful when moving it (from counter to fridge etc.) so you don't spill. We solved this problem by pouring tea into a different container in the fridge that holds over a gallon so we can make more tea and (almost) never run out!Other than never being able to get all the tea off the parts (tea really stains!) we have been really happy with the easy use of this machine."
1,"Perfectly functional, questionable quality","The Hamilton Beach Iced Tea Maker arrived quickly with no signs of any damage. The product makes tea quickly and has an auto shutoff feature which makes things safe. The overall function of the product is worth 5 stars; however, the plastic is another story. I ran several gallons of water through the tea maker over a week in attempt to get rid of the almost overwhelming plastic taste/smell out of the brewing pot. After careful inspection of the brewing pot, I found no indications as to what type of plastic it's made from. I will be returning this because I feel there might be a small amount of risk involved with the plastic. Unlabeled plastic, strong plastic smell, and the fact that it's made in China for a low price point are all indicators of risk for me. China is perfectly capable of making high quality products, but the US demands the cheapest possible and corners are cut."
4,Nice and Functional,"It makes delicious tea and looks good when the pitcher is in the refrigerator. What more could you want?Actually, this tea maker replaced a much older one and I wonder why we didn't do that sooner. We prefer to just use water in the pitcher, instead of ice cubes, as that makes the sweetening process a little easier. But it all depends on how soon you want to drink the finished product."
2,Leaks water when brewing,"We have had this Hamilton Beach Ice Tea Maker for about a year and use it 3 or 4 times a week. It started leaking water during the brewing process. The water puddles under the main section of the unit. Prior to the leak the ice tea maker performed flawlessly. Because of the leaking I cannot recommend model 40911. The warranty period has, of course, expired:*("
2,Leaks,"This was my second Hamilton Beach Iced Tea Maker ordered from Amazon. The first one lasted 2 years and then started leaking at the bottom. This resulted in the metal parts rusting and a tendency for yucky stuff to grown on the bottom. So I ordered another one 6 months ago and now that is leaking, too. To be fair, I am a southerner and make tea almost every day. I love everything else about this product, but just wish they would fix the seal or whatever it is that goes wrong. Until then I will try another brand.Hamilton Beach Iced Tea Maker"
2,Wonky Power Button,"This ided tea maker makes good iced tea, but the power button it temperamental and needs to be pushed several times REALLY hard before it brews the tea. Probably should exchange the unit I got for another."
2,iced tea maker,"I received the iced tea maker today with excitement as I have been brewing my iced tea all summer. I washed it and and ran clean water thru it to make sure it was clean and ready to brew tea. That was the last water it brewed. It will no longer turn on! I am giving it a lot of time to rest in hopes it will work again, but don't have high hopes. I suspect I will be contacting Amazon for a return. How disappointing!!!"
5,Hamilton Beach 40911 2-Quart Electric Iced Tea Maker - review,"This product works great. As other customers have said, it doesn't have the same leak problems as the newer Mr. Coffee machines have. Although everyone loved the old Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker that we used to own, this one works great and fits much easier into a side-by-side fridge. It seems to be a little taller than the Mr. Coffee containers which is good cause it actually wastes less space in the fridge.I recommend this tea maker."
4,Great glass of tea,"I followed the advice of waiting to add the ice and let the hot tea sit for about 10 minutes. No bitter taste, but good tea.I have been using tea bags. Luzianne decaf bags. It's a great glass of tea on one of the many hot days we have in Arizona."
2,misleading,This product is very misleading! You make 1 qt of tea and add 1 qt of ice and thats how they get the 2 qts of iced tea! I make tea by the gallon so I had to use my gallon tea bag and another pitcher and brew from this pitcher 4 times....its easier the old fashion way! Dont waste your money unless you have nothing bettet to do with your day.
1,Piece of Crap,"Amazon replaced this tea maker twice for, and all three of them were dead on arrival. Do not waste your money on this product."
3,Tea Maker,"I ordered this item to make sweet tea for my husband, a native Southerner. It was highly recommended by someone online. Only problem: I couldn't figure out how everyone else was adding the sugar. If you add the sugar to the ice before brewing, it gets cold and doesn't disolve. You can't add the sugar to the top portion where the teabags are, can you? We use substitute sugars anyway, but none of them mixed well with the tea. I started adding as much water as I could to make more tea, leaving out the ice cubes. When it is done, I add the sweetner, then the ice cubes - either to the pitcher or to our individual glasses. But it's not as user friendly as I thought it might be. I think there's got to be a better way to make 'easy tea'."
3,doesn't do what it states it does,"this is supposed to have a dial that allows you to set the strength of brew you desire. The dial does not turn. It is set in one position and there it stays. There is no way to adjust it.This iced tea maker works pretty much the same as all others do. I'm putting it away for our next garage sale because it is taking up precious counter space and I can do just as well with my coffee maker.Yes, it makes tea.It will make iced tea if you manually put the ice in the pitcher. Imagine that!No, it does not allow you to adjust strength of brew."
2,"Good tea maker, HORRIBLE PITCHER!!","Previously, I had been using the Mr. Coffee iced tea maker (tall white cylindrical model), and this one is definitely an upgrade. It works very similarly as the others on the market: 1 quart of water in the device well, 1 quart in the pitcher. There are settings for preferred strength, but I have noticed very little difference in taste and color between ""strong"" and ""medium."" Of course, the best way to regulate the strength of the tea is through the number of tea bags you use. The bad thing about this is the pitcher, which is slim by design. This creates for A LOT of tilt when pouring the tea. When you tilt to pour it comes out very quickly. Also, if you place it anywhere near the edge of a table, it will, given the nature of liquid, tilt over the edge and break all too easily. Whoever thought of this slim design should be out of the business. I have tried contacting HB for replacement parts, but have never heard anything back."
4,Works when there isn't any sun available,It's winter time and I really miss my suntea - with the Iced tea maker I can still enjoy tea in the winter.
5,Great product,"Love it! My husband drinks ice tea 24/7/365, so we go thru a lot of it. Very easy to use, makes great tea (we like ours strong and have had no issues). All in all great product."
2,It was great while it lasted,"We bought the Hamilton Beach Iced Tea Maker about 18 months ago. It made great iced tea and saw us through two summers' daily use.Recently the main reservoir began to leak all over the counter, rendering it useless. The warranty period is only one year.Sad to see it fail so soon. Guess we'll try The Authentic Southern Sweet Tea Brewer. Hammacher offers a lifetime warranty."
5,GREAT TEA MAKER !!!,"I used a mr coffee maker a few years back. (NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS)I saw this one on AMAZON and ordered it. I have used it every day since the day it arrived with perfect results. I use 1 quart of water in the maker and 1 quart in the pitcher with 1 cup of sugar. (NO ICE). I brew the tea and only put ice in my tea glass. ( PERFECT TEA )DUKE of BRADENTON, FLORIDA"
5,A better tea maker....,"Love this simply for the ""skinny"" pitcher.....the narrow design is a better fit in the fridge. Nice design....works great so far."
4,HB 4091 Iced Tea Maker,"We've been using this machine for about a year now. No leaking problems. The pitcher is basically sound where our former Mr. Coffee machine leaked around the spout within a few months. However I find the pitchers' oblong design somewhat cumbersome. When it is full, it takes both hands to get it out of the fridge and pour it, since the spout is a good distance from the handle and difficult to control. And since it has no ""spout cover"" it spills easily. Also wish it was more than 2 qts, we have to make a pot every other day! Overall, it's holding up good."
3,pitcher hard to balance,"I was expecting a great product after checking out these reviews. However, unless you can carry it completely level, tea pours out of both front and back. I know this is not a problem for most, but if you have a vision or mobility impairment, carry the pitcher with both hands."
4,Good tea maker,"I use this tea maker at work and it does a good job. Need to use one more tea bag than if I were making the tea in a kettle, but it's easier."
3,disposable teamaker,"I like this teamaker of all the ones available. The only thing is that is doesn't last very long. I purchase one every year because I have to keep pushing the start button every 45 seconds to get a pitcher of tea made. It keeps shutting off. It's suppose to make a pitcher of tea in 10 minutes, but it take me around 30 minutes with having to keep pushing the start button everytime it goes off. Don't know if I keep getting defects or if the switch just needs to be re-designed. I make a pitcher of tea every day all year long."
5,LOVE IT,"I used to always make my tea on the stove, and although that worked, it was always a pain to have to wash a pot, watch for boil over, and such. This makes tea making easy, set it, walk away, and come back when it is finished for some great tea. Very very pleased."
4,Second one I've owned,"This is the second one I've owned. The first one started leaking, then it failed to heat all the water it's supposed to. However, the tea maker does last a decent amount of time (3 years), considering that I use it almost daily. Compared to the cost of a commercial-grade tea maker, this one is actually quite cost-effective, despite its finite lifespan. It works quickly, is easy to use, and fairly easy to clean."
5,Best Tea Maker - Worth every penny,I have had this very iced tea maker for over a year. I make about 4 or more pitchers a week. Everyone loves the tea I make so much that I am buying pitchers for a couple of my friends from Amazon (best price out there). I suggest buying Paradise Iced Tea or Trader Joe's Mango Black Tea. I even purchase simple syrup from Starbucks to sweeten the tea. Cost per usage of this pitcher absolutly makes it a steal. I am so glad I researched this tea maker before I purchased it.
5,Best tea maker,"This Iced Tea maker is marvelous. We have had 3 or 4 of the other brand, all of which ended up not working properly and leaking. This one works the best so far and the flavor is amazing. Very happy and this one is less expensive."
3,Like the Speed not the Spout !,"We love the speed and convenience of the tea maker...just not the Spout on the pitcher !The slim design works well in a Fridge door,but if you have to lift it out of a Shelf unit with high sides you tend to spill your tea on the Floor ! The spout end has no cover....our other (former) tea pitcher had a top that kept the tea in until you were ready to pour.Other than that ...no complaints.Thanx"
5,great tea maker,I have owned another unnamed brand of tea maker that the pitcher fell apart after about 2 months. We have had this one about a year and using the same pitcher we started with. Very good product and highly recommended.
5,Perfect,This is a great ice tea maker. I have owned this for 6 or more months. It gets a lot of use. It is sturdy and easy to use. This is my second iced tea maker. The first one was a different brand and needed to be replaced because the pitcher cracked. This one has shown no signs of problems.
2,Not a fan of the design,"I purchased this two years ago and used it for a long time. The problem I had with it is that the tea bags actually go in a contraption on the top of the container, not in the maker itself. So what this means is that you put the piece in the container, put the tea bags in, put the lid on and then line it up with the brewer. And when you are done you have two options: A) Leave the tea bags in there and put the entire thing in the fridge, or B) open it up and remove the top piece with the tea bags so you can clean it, and put sugar in the tea. I'm not a fan of removing this hot piece of plastic and hot tea bags from my tea immediately."
1,hamilton beach icetea maker,I purchased this product about 5 months ago it worked fine for 3 months but about 2 months ago it started leaking from the bottom of it whenever it is used and leaves water and rust spots on the counter.am going to get a new ice tea potsoon but dont know if it will be hamilton beach or not. makes great tea but dont want to have to buy a new pot every 3 months or so.
4,Other than myself,"Dear Amazon,I bought the product as a gift for my son-in-law. He really likes the ice tea maker. He would have to rate it, but my guess it would be over three stars."
5,Hamilton Beach Tea Maker,Absolutely love it. Worked exactly as expected. Didn't have any leaking problem. Have make several batches. All turned out the same.
3,Hamilton Beach 40911 2-Quart Electric Iced Tea Maker,"Bought this after great reviews. Not overly impressed. Being oblong, it seems to be heavy on the spout end, which has ended up with spills. It takes a long time for all of the tea to drip through..so don't be in a hurry for tea. I have really considered going back to my old Mr Coffee Iced Tea Maker."
5,Tea on Demand,"When my wife says, ""do you want some tea?"" she is only talking about hot and in a cup. I only know tea in a tall glass with ice and a lot of sugar! Enter a way for me to make quick easy brewed tea on my own for my ice / glass. This Hamilton Beach 1qt tea maker is just great. Just like it says, fill the back, drop your tea bags (or loose tea) in the top of the jug, press the ""go"" button and 10 minutes later you have great tea. The maker is set up to first put ice in the jug then press start to have ice tea in 10 minutes but I have not tried that method yet. I assume that it works just as well and you don't have to wait for the tea to cool down on its own. I highly recommend this item."
2,Makes great tea but . . .,"I had several Mr Coffee automatic iced tea makers over the years but was disappointed that the seams on the pitchers eventually leak, so when the last one went I purchased the Hamilton Beach iced tea maker.Both brands make terrific iced tea. The Hamilton Beach pitcher is still going strong after two years, however it is quite heavy when full and the narrow shape gives it a different center of gravity than the round Mr Coffee pitcher. I is difficult to handle with my arthritic hands. Also, every time anyone pours tea from it some spills on the table or counter. When the pitcher is full, there are tea spills going in and out of the refrigerator.I just purchased a new Mr Coffee iced tea maker andHamilton Beach 40911 2-Quart Electric Iced Tea Makerextra pitchers."
1,"Good Tea, Poorly made product","I have made no more than 6 pitchers of tea. Was impressed at first. Tea flavor is excellent. But when I went to make some today, I noticed the pitcher is cracked in 2 places at the bottom of the handle :(Didn't put in dishwasher (only handwash) and no roughhousing by kids. I live alone. So much for my great Tea maker!I tried to contact seller through amazon but was unable to find a way through amazon."
2,DOES NOT WORK FOR WHAT I USE IT.,"I HAVE TRIED AND TRIED TO MAKE TEA IN THIS TEA POT. I USE LOOSE LEAF TEA AND IT STOPS THE HOLE UP AND THE TEA WILL NOT DRAIN THROUGH CORRECTLY. IT MAY WORK WITH TEA BAGS, BUT SINCE I DO NOT USE BAGS, I CANNOT COMMENT ON THAT. I WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN."
1,Dead On Arrival,"I was so looking forward to the arrival of this machine. With temperatures over 100 degrees in Dallas for 18 straight days I needed something cool and refreshing. I filled the tower up with 1 quart of water, filled the pitcher up to the max line with ice and placed three family size tea bags in the filter. Plugged the machine in, pressed the power button and then ............nothing. No light no power. Made sure that the electrical plug was working and tried again. I called Amazon and they are sending out an immediate replacement (thank you Amazon and Kevin in customer service). Because of the solid reviews I saw on this machine I'm willing to give it a second chance. Hoping I got a lemon and am looking forward to a better experience with the replacement."
5,Wife loves it!,Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she uses it every day! Very easy to use and easy clean-up too.
2,Disappointed,"I also have used a Mr. Coffee iced tea maker for years, but my 10 year old pot finally croaked. I'd heard the redesign of the Mr. Coffee iced tea brewer is not as good as my old model. This one got the best reviews and I decided to get one. Well? I have my tea on the strongest setting and it is WEAK! I like strong iced tea and although there is nothing wrong with the setup, I don't think that the tea steeps long enough in this one. I am disappointed, and will keep looking."
2,Space saver,"I like the design and actually chose it for the size. Within one week of regular use, I noticed water around the bottom of water container. I thought I must have spilled some when pouring it in. But it continued show up. I have tried to figure out where the water is coming from but I do not know. The bottom of the water container is showing rust because of sitting on a towel and I did not completely dry it each time we used it. We have had this for a year now. I am ready to find something else. I sure wish this one had worked."
4,Quick and easy ice tea maker!,"Awesome tea maker for the price. I like my tea freshly brewed and this tea maker does a great job doing that. Every batch that I've brewed so far (green tea, black tea, and oolong tea) have came out great. Three settings allows you to control how strong you'd like your tea, which brings me to a minor issue with the maker.The drip rate is controlled by a rotatable knob. While this works, I feel that the first cup of water is ""wasted"" because it just drips right out before the tea leaves unfurl. As a result, the batch feels a little more watered down but then I also prefer my tea to be a little stronger than most people."
3,Had once before and was great,"The last time I owned one of these it was awesome. So, when I couldn't find it after a house fire I was sad. We bought a CoffeeMate and suffered, and eventually found this one on Amazon. I was so excited! But, every time I make tea with it, it spills water all over my counter. I called HB and they said they would send me a new lid. It still spills all over my counter, but because I didn't call them back the second time befor the warrenty from when I originally bought the item ran out, I was out of luck! I should have called them when I first got it, but they have odd hours (I think they are pacific standard time), and I kept missing them :(. So after waiting for a couple weeks to get it, and try it, I'm stuck with a HUGE mess every time I use it. Now I wish I hadn't given away my CoffeeMate! Now I use it with out the lid, and with out the middle, just put the tea bag in the hot water...I could do that on the stove...and so much for using loose leaf tea!"
5,Love it easy to use,"I love this product! I like that we have the customer reviews to go by it makes it alot easy when trying to figure out if the product will be good or not! This ice maker is quick and easy to use :-)Many thanks,TR"
4,Why only one lid?,"I bought this based on reviews. I was surprised though that it only had one lid when it came with two pitchers. It does make good tea though so I'd recommend it, but I think if you provide two pitchers, there should be two lids!"
5,Makes great iced tea,"I'm extremely pleased with this iced tea maker. It is fast and easy, and has a variety of settings for brewing iced tea at my desired strength. I haven't used the feature for sweeteners, but all other features and settings work well. I haven't experienced any of the leaking described by some others. All in all, I couldn't be happier with this product."
1,Leaky Product,So I bought this Iced tea maker awhile ago and ive had mixed results the spout that pours the hot water through the loose tea leaves sputters and sometimes leaks i thought i might not have it on a level surface but that was not the issue it works great when it does work properly but thats only about half the time
4,Great purchase,"Compact, light weight and easy to use. Love the tea maker-wish it didn't stain so quickly, but that is the drawback of plastic versus glass and metal. I definitely suggest ordering a second pitcher as you won't be wanting to put this out for guests after a few months. The tea is fine- I have read reviews about it being weak and have never encountered that problem. If anything, I have had to thin it out for guests as my husband likes it rather dark. I would recommend this as a gift or a personal purchase."
4,ice tea maker,This product is good for making iced tea. It is easy to use and I don't really have any issures with it. My family drinks iced tea quite often and I am using it once or twice a day to make the tea. I would recomend this product to anyone who wants an iced tea maker.
4,Great tea maker!,"Hamilton Beach 40911 2-Quart Electric Iced Tea MakerEasy to use tea maker. This is my first and I chose it based on the other reviews. Makes great iced tea very quickly. It's a little strange, because it's long and narrow, much different footprint than other appliances, but I don't keep it on the the counter top. It might be a strange shape for someone who wants to leave it out all the time.Would recommend. Easy to use and clean. Pitcher fits in the refrigerator. Requires lots of tea bags, so buy the bigger ones."
5,Awesome!,"When I decided to invest in an ice-tea maker I looked almost everywhere and at all products. The Hamilton beach was always rated the highest. So I tried it and am I glad I did. It works like a dream. Easy to use, easy to clean, and it makes a really good pitcher of tea. So, to be honest, if you look anywhere else you would be foolish. This one is the best!"
3,mr coffee better,"This ice tea maker is just okay. I purchased for our summer trailer, but prefer the Mr Coffee Ice Tea Maker I have at home."
1,Very Poor Product,"I've had a couple of iced tea makers and was pleased with them both. This one is just awful. Even using 14 tea bags for the 2-quart pitcher, I wind up with a very weak brew that would make any Southerner toss the thing out. And that's what I'm about to do. It is compact, takes up only a little room, has a pretty neat design. But it just makes lousy tea. Boiling water isn't as convenient as an electric tea maker, it's worth the extra few minutes to have a tea you wouldn't be ashamed to serve to guests."
1,Dead out of the box,"Product doesn't work out of the box. Won't heat up, won't turn on. Nothing. Too bad there's not a non-chinese brand for $40- $50, I'd buy it in a hearbeat."
1,MISLEADING ADVERTISING,THIS IS NOT A 2 QUART MAKER. YOU MAKE ONE QUART OF TEA AND ADD ONE QUART OF ICE...HOW IS THAT A 2 QT TEA MAKER?? BAH!DON'T BOTHER.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"HB claims it fits in the refrigerator door and it does not. In fact, I tried it in multiple refrigerator's and it only fit one of four. It also makes weak tasting tea! Get the Mr. Coffee TM1. It makes much better tea!"
1,Elliott Ace Hardware,They sent me a new one but been 3 days now and haven't heard from them since I've gotten it. But it doesn't even work and see they have taken their name off the list of sellers for this item. Hoping they contact me soon to send me a return shipping label and get one that works.
2,Won't buy again.,We bought this one after our last tea maker stopped working. We even thought we were buying a better brand. This tea maker only lasted about 6 mo. I guess if you don't make tea every day it will work for you but it didnt for us.
5,Better Than Mr. Coffee's Teamaker,"Much better design than other teamakers. For example, my Mr. Coffee pitcher warped and did not fit into the water unit correctly, resulting in a poor fit that leaked around the pitcher. The Hamilton Beach pitcher fits snugly and is held in place by the smart design of the tray. The HB pitcher is well designed, easy to clean, and sturdy (hard plastic instead of a softer plastic, but you must hand wash). The HB creates very hot water that causes a good, strong batch of tea from the bags. You can also use loose tea, if you prefer."
5,Hamilton Beach 40911 Electric Iced Tea Maker,This is an excellent product in every way. It replaced an older and very inferior model. I think anyone who likes iced tea would be happy with this machine. I particularly like the clever pull-out tray that securely holds the pitcher in place during brewing.
5,SOOO EASY!,This is my first tea maker and it is incredibly easy to use with very easy instructions; also very quick to brew the tea itself. I don't mind that it isn't dishwasher safe as I just rinse the brew basket right away and let air dry. Very good tea!
4,First Iced Tea Maker,"After tiring of instant iced tea and finding the store bought iced tea rather expensive over the long haul I decided to buy an iced tea maker. Overall I am very happy with the purchase as it was not very expensive and it makes a very nice pot of tea. I have not used loose tea yet, only tea bags but still it makes a nice pot. About the only complaint I do have is that the tea is rather hot just after brewing and to add the recommended amount of ice waters down the tea too much in my opinion. I also with that they would have made the container, lid, and filter dishwasher safe. Other than those minor gripes I cannot see how I could have gone wrong with this maker."
2,Short shelf life,"Received this for Christmas 9 months ago & it leaks really bad from underneath. Before it met it's doom, it was a nice working product but now I can't use it unless I want all the counters covered with water. I don't recommend this machine."
5,As advertised,I've had a few Mr. Coffee tea makers before and always had that spill problem where tea leaks out the front. No more though! This tea maker works fantastic! Just as described in the reviews and no more spilled tea on the counter like before. I'm glad I found this tea maker! I've been brewing tea non stop since I got it! Thanks amazon! I'm glad you had it!
3,Very Good Iced Tea Maker,I am very pleased with the Hamilton Beach Iced Tea Maker. It has worked flawlessly. The brewed tea has a very good flavor. The process is uncomplicated and the clean up is easy. Overall recommended.
4,Great Iced Tea,I have really enjoyed this iced tea maker. I found the instructions asked for more tea bags than I liked; I only use 3 or 4 for a full pitcher. The service was fast and this stores easily too.
1,Don't buy this item.,I will not buy this product again. The entire bottom of the unit is rusting. I like the pitcher but that is it.
3,Moderately Happy,"Arrived quickly, handsome looking. First few pitchers of tea were out of this world. Then a plastic taste/smell developed which originates from the brewing unit--not in the pitcher as some reviews on here suggest. I have flushed the unit twice with white vinegar and will be using again sometime in the next week...will update then. If it is still there will probably trash the unit and go back to the good ole pot on the stove like my grandmother taught me when I was a wee lad. Unfortunately I do not have a lot of patience for back and forth phone calls with a manufacturer...besides I can't say I was not warned after reading similar complaints of the plastic taste/smell on here."
5,Betters Mr. Coffee,"This iced tea maker is far superior to the Mr. Coffee design--tho it produces a third less tea per brewing. Mr. Coffee tended to leak about once every three brewings--yeh, we followed the directions. Oddly, the strength control of our Hamilton Beach is marked backwards--meaning, we have to set it on weak to get strong tea but maybe that was just a production issue on our unit (and a few thousand others) but once you figure that out it produces great iced tea. Now if they'd just make the pitcher dishwasher-safe..."
4,Iced Tea Maker,"This is a good product, it's easy to use and makes ready to drink iced tea in about 10 minutes."
1,bad smell,"regardless of how many times I've run water through the tea maker, the tea has a terrible ""plastic"" aftertaste. makes the machine unusable."
2,It's misleading...,"Technically this is a 1-Quart iced tea maker. If you don't add the specificed amount of ice then you have to improvise. If you use quality, loose leaf teas, you have to improvise. If you're a Lipton, black tea drinker then this is the perfect machine for you. If you're more of a no ice, high quality loose leaf green or white tea drinker, then don't chance it."
3,Hamilton Beach 40911 2-Quart Electric Iced Tea Maker,"I wasn't crazy about this iced tea maker. The pitcher isn't dish washer safe (I forgot to check that out before I bought it) and the pitcher is quite flimsy or so it feels. There is a pull out thing that the pitcher has to sit on will the tea brews, it's a real pain in the ass and very unnecessary. The tea is fine and the pitcher does fit nicely in the fridge door compartment,but...the reason I bought this machine was because of the rave review someone else posted. If my Mr Coffee pitcher didn't keep needing to be replaced, I wouldn't have bought a new tea maker (I went back to my Mr Coffee)"
1,junk,"This Iced Tea Maker leaks.If you want to brew tea without making a mess, you must remove the lid, remove the basket and steep the bags in the hot water that drips into the pitcher.It does this nicely, but trying to use the Iced Tea Maker as intended leaks all over the counter.If you are looking for an easy way to brew tea this is not the equipment to use.I gave it one star because 0 stars is not an option.If you put your ear close to the machine you will hear a sucking sound."
2,Poor Taste,Works well and have had no counter top leaks as with the new design Mr. Coffee but the tea is weak even using the Strong setting. I have had 2 of the older Mr. Coffee machines (bought 1t one in 1987) that worked very well until the last one quit working in 2003. Since that time I have tried 2 of the new design Mr. Coffee which both leaked all over my counter top and now I purchased this pot and I am very disappointed in the quality of tea it produces.
4,Update of previous review but Amazon won't let me lower score,"01-19-09 Review: Both of the Hamilton Beach Tea Makers I purchased for my own use have begun to leak water all over the countertop. There's been no abuse or damage, so there's no reason for the failure. Furthermore, I've given three as gifts, so I fear that any day now those will fail, as well. Very disappointed, as I'd hoped to find a permanent replacement for Mr. Coffee. . .ORIGINAL REVIEW:This Iced Tea Maker was purchased to replace the Mr. Coffee 3 Quart Iced Tea Maker which seems to have an inherent manufacturing flaw regarding leaking pitchers.Based on positive reviews of the Hamilton Beach, and my recent excellent experiences with other of their kitchen products, I purchased two and so far have been quite pleased with the quality of the tea and the performance."
4,So Good So Far.....(UPDATE FROM 3 YRS AGO),"I've had this product since May, and so far it hasn't let me down once. The tea it brews is extremely good (I use 4 little bags, and set the strength to strong), and it brews pretty darn fast. Very easy to clean up, and I like the fact that the brew basket is separate from the unit as a whole, which makes it easy for cleaning. I will say, however, that I hate that you can't put the pitcher in the dishwasher, and that there is no replacement pitcher to purchase.....On a whole though, it beats ""Mr. Coffee"" hands down. There is no comparison between the two. Mr Coffee failed me miserably.September, 2010: My tea maker is STILL working like a charm, and STILL brews WONDERFUL tea. I love this product of 3 years. It has held up wonderfully, and still is everything I mentioned it to be when I bought it."
5,A pure delight!,"My husband and I needed a new iced tea maker after one of us accidentally threw away the brewing basket on our old West Bend tea maker. So I came to Amazon to check out what was available and the ratings thereto. Based on the reviews I read here, I purchased this model.My husband rarely comments on kitchen appliances, but he was delighted with this one. It is sleek and narrow, has a pullout slide to keep the pitcher steady during brewing, and the brewing mechanism is most unlikely to leak, if the pitcher is put in properly. The pitcher itself is also sleek and narrow and can fit in the fridge door compartments. It takes up little room on the shelves if, like ours, the door shelves are densely occupied.We have had it for several months now and have experienced no cons."
4,Makes good tea,"Simple design, works well. Since the pitcher itself is where the tea bags are placed you have to use the included pitcher. This is kind of a negative, but hasn't been a big deal so far. My biggest problem has been keeping the pitcher clean after lots of use."
5,Easiest ice tea I ever made.,"It is so easy to make ice tea now!!!!Place tea bags in filter, pour quart if water in well to heat water, put sweetener in picture put the pitcher on the tray plug it in and push the on button. About five minutes later you have tea. I taste the tea before I add the ice.Next thing you know your on the porch drinking ice tea and reading a book. I would suggest this product to everyone who likes tea, hot or cold."
4,definitely a good read...,"not the best book i've ever read, but certainly not the worst. i find i'm getting into that area where i'm reading all those books about independent young 30something women written by british authors... i don't quite know how it happened, but if you're into those types of books (ralph's party, bridget jones's diary), you'll love this book. the ending is a little disappointing after reading through the entire book, but it only takes a day or two to read, despite its size."
4,Not as Funny as Tiffany...But Just as Good,"Wolff is a very engaging writer, and this book was well worth the read. It took me three days to read it, and a few times I even hid it on my lap under my desk at work, so that I could get a few pages in here and there...The character development was at its best with Minty- who had a lot of growing and maturing to do. Unlike many books, where personality flaws are suddenly overcome in a lazy rush in the last chapter, the subtle growth of Minty was flawless- never was it ""in your face,"" and the end result was a very convincing and realtistic.This book was not humorous in the 'laugh-out-loud' sense- though, it did have its moments..Only one scene comes to mind that I considered to be truly ""funny,"" and that was the party at Jack's house.This was much more on par with ""Out of the Blue,"" both in layout, plot, and style, as opposed to ""Tiffany.""I couldn't put it down- Isabel Wolff never disappoints."
5,Much better than Tiffany,"I read Minty first(before her other book ""The Trials of Tiffany Trott""), glad that I did or I probably wouldn't have read it. Was fun and exciting, highly recommend!"
5,I love Minty Malone!,"I loved Tiffany Trott and I adore Minty Malone. Well done Isabel Wolff! A very well-written and hysterically funny account of how one woman gets over the emotional trauma of being dumped - on her wedding day! I couldn't stop turning the pages and kept laughing out loud which is very unusual for me. There are so many brilliant characters from Amber - the bossy worst-selling novelist and her talking parrot, to Melinda - the world's worst radio presenter. I also loved Minty's mad dash to Hollywood to try and find her Mr Right. With so many twists and turns in the plot I was kept on the edge of my seat right to the last page.Summing up, The Making of Minty Malone is beautifully described with sparkling dialogue in Wolff's brilliantly ironic style."
3,Much better than Tiffany,Words cannot say how much better than 'Tiffany' this book really is! I almost don't believe it's the same author. This book was written with much more feeling and insight. I thouroughly enjoyed this book!
4,A light and easy read .,"I like this book , interesting characters overall. I like the part where minty suddenly understood herself better. Great book!"
3,"Formula read..., but catchy","If you're a regular reader, you'll figure out every plot twist in this book WAY before poor Minty! Very formulaic, but cute and sweet at the same time. If you're looking for a romantic little get-away that won't tax your brain (in the least), you might enjoy this beach book......"
2,A bit too predictable,"Although the story was a lighthearted one, it was a bit too predictable. The characters were superficial and not terribly endearing. I found it difficult to sympathize with Minty especially when she made that trip to LA. I completed this book, but wish the story had more depth."
4,She's just like me ....,"Unlike Bridget Jones obsessed by her diet and man, Minty Malone shows her life is more than that: relationship with the person around her, success in her career etc.. I might be one of many girls who keep being nice to the others, and feel good when she yelled ¡No¡ or lied ¡ I¡m busy¡. And I empathized her when she had her hair cut.It¡s very hilarious and delightful."
2,Very Disappointing,"I picked up this book hoping to have a book that would make me laugh and I could read quickly. I almost wasn't able to finish it. The first 40 pages were poorly written and the main character, Minty, felt completely fake. I wasn't buying the 'too nice' business the author felt she had to reiterate every other page. The characters were semi-interesting but not altogether believable. Minty was annoying. The plot was annoying. Almost everything about this book was horrible. I kept reading after the first 40 pages hoping that the author just didn't know how to write as an insecure woman, and it did get better! But not good enough."
1,Disappointing!,I bought this book with such high hopes after reading the reviews posted on-line. My allusions were quickly shattered a few pages into the book. The main character is annoynig from the very outset. She lets her fiancee treat her like dirt and then is shocked when he leaves her at the altar. As the book progresses Minty fell lower and lower in my eyes she is such a whiner with no personslity. The only upside to this book is her cuz Amber the only character in this book worth reading. A complete waste of paper.
2,un-original,"I finished this book in less than 1 week. Not because it was hard to put down, but because it was so perdictable that I was searching so hard (by reading faster) for something original that this author had to write about. And, I am still amazed that how poorly written this book is. One can easily see that the author uses characters in the book to play out arguements of the main top: how nice is too nice? But it was done with such transparency that bored you to tears."
3,ok i guess,"i was expecting the sent to last longer, but its ok my sasuke (shih tzu) dosent mind the sent at all hes so spoiled. i think its a good product but after a while the sent is gone. makes sasuke feel like a prince cause after his bath and his cologne is one happy pup"
4,Good value,Good quality picture hangers at a very good price. A good assortment is included for a wide range of picture sizes.
2,How can 12 hooks hang 17 frames?,"Like these style hangers but assumed that the kit comes with 17 hooks, not 12. Unless you use the extra pins alone, I have no idea how 17 frames are hung... Also, hung a picture (maybe 25 - 30lbs) with a 50lb hook and the pin failed (sheared). Picture can crashing to the floor, glass all over the place, and gouged up our chair rail and base boards."
5,These are the best,I've been buying this style of hanger for years. The preset angles and small brads with large heads make hanging any size frame easy. The brads pull out by hand and do not leave much of a hole.
5,Great product,"Great product and a great price. These are by far the best picture hanging pieces I have found, and better price than Target."
1,All Wet,"I have used these hangers from other sources and found them good. The package I got was full of water. The box they were shipped in had no water damage, and the other things in the box were not wet. I seems clear that the package was full of water when it was packed; that is shabby. The hangers are steel with a coating of brass-like stuff, so the wet hooks rusted. Bummer."
3,quality concerns,"Overall a good product, but several of the hooks are of poor quality - holes in hooks not complete/won't allow nails to pass"
2,incorrect sized nails for hooks.,"There were several 'hangers' in the pack. I used about half of them and could not use the remaining 'hangers' because the nails would not fit thru the holes on the hangers. The ones I could use were great, but I was certainly hoping that I would be able to use ALL of the hangers in the package. About 1/2 of them are unusable because of this problem with the nails not fitting thru the holes. I saw another review that said the same thing before I purchased them and thought it must have been an irregularity with just their particular package, but several weeks after they posted that review, I ordered my pack and had the same problem. It seems to be an ongoing problem that HOPEFULLY the mfg. will correct soon."
1,Total Garbage,I ordered these based on the high ratings. I had a mirror that needed to be re-hung. It weighed in at 30 lbs so I thought the 50lb hook would be more than sufficient. It lasted about 2 hours before one of the nails completely failed and the whole thing came crashing down with the most significant damage to the molding below the mirror. After this experience I have no faith in this product.
3,34 pieces a bit misleading,Amazon has this listed as a 34 piece set. It's a bit misleading since it later says in the product information that it only hangs 17 pieces. I was confused recently when I only received one package of 17 pieces believing Amazon had forgotten to send one package. Be sure to order 2 if you're planning on 34 hangers. Quality is decent on these otherwise.
5,fantastic product,"The nails a sharp and hardened, when they get into the wall they cause almost no cracks.The hanger themselves make sure the nails go in the right angle.I used cheap hangers (the ones that come for free with picture frames), I like this product much better, worth every cent."
4,You can work wonders with just this,"We transformed our walls into great decor just buy using this kit and hanging up so many of the great pictures that we never hung up since we moved in last year.It does not get any better than this. I wrecked a few because they bend kinda easy but who cares, you get a lot of them."
5,For many different sizes,"I liked the different sizes for different sizes and weights of pictures. Very handy, sturdy, and and provides lots of hanging for a little money."
1,don't stand behind their products,"bought a $1100 grill 4years ago and burners, and parts inside disintegrated. They replaced all but one part because it's no longer made. Too bad it's the part that hold the burners up. Buy a Weber"
2,A very thorough history of the Lewis and Clark expedition,"This book will be good for those who do not want to read the journals of L & C but want a complete, thorough report. The book gave many specific details, and often got sidetracked off into extra tidbits of information. For those looking for just a general overview of this journey, this book is not the place to find it."
1,this one is beyond bad,"shower head does not deliver enuf water to wet a washcloth, much less bath. I sent it back, got another one and they are both just very low pressure stream with a mist like affect. say no to this one."
2,Not nearly as good as past experience.,"Currently we use an older low flow Alsons type head that still works perfectly after more than 10 years. It is the favorite shower head in the house! Good hard spray with standard sized drops. Only wish I could find another. The mfg as I understand it, after quite some web research I did, was sold along with the patent. Whoever bought it, Alsons or somebody else, does not have it right. This model we just purchased has a mist spray that is just not satisfactory. I was trying to get the family to use other showers we have, but this head is not going to make that happen."
2,Not that good,"I bought this shower head after reading these reviews online and was disappointed. It does give a spraying mist of water, but as far as increasing pressure or surpassing other heads I've used, it does not. I would not buy another one. On the positive side, it is cheap and it does install easily"
1,Leaky at joint and pressure not what I expected.,I would not recommend this shower head. It leaked at the joint and the pressure was not good.
5,Simple and to the point,"I'll be honest--this is a NO FRILLS showerhead, not a luxury model. However, it does a number of things very well. It excels with low water pressure, giving a fine sharp spray (that also generates a lot of steam, nice for warming up the shower on a cold morning). What I really love about it is that it comes apart easily with an allen wrench, allowing you to thoroughly clean it for reassembly--very important if you have a house with incredibly hard water. Try disassembling a complex sealed plastic showerhead! Easily worth the extremely low price."
2,wasn't impressed,"I bought this based on the reviews of others and was disappointed.For me the spray was very concentrated into a single area (in retrospect, by looking at the design, I should have guessed) but anyway just so as everyone else is aware, this is highly directional, think garden hose.Also the holes were so fine, that the water felt more like a mist than a shower.On the good side though is that it's well built, it just didn't fit my needs. I ended up going down to ACE Hardware and buying an AquaSource #item36572 1-spray setting wall-mount showerhead instead. It was about twenty bucks and made a huge difference."
1,NOT WORTH 25 cents,"I bought two of these because they resembled a similar product known as ""the incredible head"" that I used to put in apartments. This shower head is completely inferior. In fact both that I bought are now in the garbage. The spray pattern from these heads was just plain absurd. Also, the head was difficult to adjust once installed."
1,poor advertising,I purchased this under the impression that I was receiving all of the bone toys - apparently you only receive one toy when you buy this product. I am glad I got this on sale as this is not a deal at all for one toy! The description even pluralizes the item as if to tell you that all the bones are included in the offer. I have five dogs that will be fighting over this for Christmas now. I am happy I purchased other toys along with this and didn't rely on just this purchase to keep them all happy this year.
1,NOT AS PICTURED OR DESCRIBED,"I breed finches. I ordered three of these boxes in an attempt to lose the messy wicker nests that take up space inside cages. The description on Amazon says ""Reverse assembled nest"", so I thought I would get three reverse assembled nests (ie. ones that can be mounted outside the cage as shown in the photo). Silly me! One nest says ""reverse"", the other two say ""regular"". Neither style looks like the picture shown. The one marked ""reverse"" might have worked, but the perch is installed INSIDE the nest box!! Really? Needless to say, I will not be ordering from this seller again!"
2,Not So Good,"I have ordered other clear cases for my razr in the past and really liked them, but this one was not so good. I only had the case on the phone for about a week when all the corners broke off, leaving the case relatively useless because the front would no longer clip on to the phone. I do recommend this product, just not this brand- look around before you decide which to buy."
2,Crack!,"This case worked great at first but the longer you have it the more it breaks, almost all the pegs on the front that hold it on to the phone have broken off, there are cracks all along the front and folks I've never even dropped. This is not hard to belive considering the price but don't waste your money."
1,Motorola Razr V3 - Clear,Not as represented. Picture shown was full face. Very unhappy with product. Will not order again.
2,Model specific fit,"This case was an honest value even with the high shipping cost. The problem is that it only fits the early versions of the Motorola Razr. I have a newer V3xx and I find I have to be careful of the accessories that I purchase. This is one that doesn't quite fit. The openings are 1mm off from the placement of the outside buttons so it holds them ""on"" at all times. I was able to enlarge the openings but still the clips on the back section are not quite long enough to grab on to the phone. Alas, this item is going into the waste basket."
3,Good price....,"Good price, questionable quality. If it wasn't for the high shipping charges through SF Planet, this would have been a winner."
1,Don't buy this case,"Wasn't what I expected. I got one of these for me and one for my son. Both cases started cracking the minute we put them on our phones. My son took his off a day later, while I lasted another couple of days before taking mine off. It made my brand new razor look horrible!"
2,Extremely Broken,The extreme crystal clear sheid fits the RAZR cell beautifully. I was impressed with the way it looked. However it did not last for five days. My cell fell out of the car as I was getting out. This was about a foot and a half drop and the case lived up to its crystal name. It chattered like a crystal wine glass.So as far as looks and fit go this item is great. Its is the durability factor that brought it down. Its is not at all durable
2,Get what you pay for,I really liked the look of the phone with this case BUT After only 2 days it started to crack and was worthless after a week. Do yourself a favor and buy a better quality case
3,Good deal,"Seems to be smaller than I thought it would be. Haven't given as a gift yet, will see how the grandson likes when he receives it for Christmas."
5,love it,"Believe it or not I love this product for my night time shower. Never in the morning for some reason. Maybe it's the clever marketing, but, it smells great and has such a soothing affect on me. Of course I layer it with the lotion and often times I use it with the shower gel. Now that may seem like a waste but the prices at Amazon are so great I can do that. Of course it moisturizes it is Dove after all. Personally, I would love for Dove to make an oil or parfum in this scent to match. And ladies, my husband never uses it but loves it on me."
1,Not what I was looking for...,This book is very touchy feely and not really what I was looking for to change business as usual in my child development center. Ideas are all over the road and doesn't really have a plan to success.
1,firestarter,"I got these pans as a christmas gift last year. The first time my boyfriend used the large pan, the inside of the pan flaked off into the boiling water. Then the paint on the bottom of the pan caught on fire and started burning off. It filled our whole kitchen with smoke."
1,Better Pasta Not So Good!,"My mom bought me this set when I first moved into my apartment. I do not recommend using this set.Here were my 2 biggest problems:1.) The dye from both pots stained my countertop. Can only be removed with soap and hot water. By the way, I have the red colored set.2.) Eventually the bottom inside (non-stick portion) of the smaller pot chipped away and I had chunks of black plastic in my pasta. Had to discard my meal and the pot.The only positive: the water does heat rather quickly. Unfortunately you are not supposed to put your stovetop heat on too high. What's the point!"
1,Not worth a dollar,"I read the brochure. It said not to heat the pots on high. So how are you supposed to boil pasta or eggs or anything? You can't. So after waiting a while I gave up and turned up the heat. After the first use the black coating was chipping off. After one trip through the dishwasher it was rusting. I've thrown the big pot away already and saved the small one for boiling eggs. It was a great idea, but poorly made. I think the warning about high heat is just to keep folks from being able to get refunds."
1,I don't enjoy black specks in my pasta!,"My husband purchased this set for me last year--I was excited at the prospect of not having to use a colander....I was not impressed, as the very first time I used it, the black interior coating flaked tiny black specks into my pasta.I washed it numerous times, gave it at least 3 more chances, and then finally gave up....the set now sits in my cabinet enjoying retirement with the smaller pot.I wouldn't waste the money again...."
2,About Methods,The book is probably 80% about the process of studying squirrels and 20% about squirrels. If you are interested in how to conduct field studies okay if you want to learn about squirrels I'd look elsewhere.brad
5,Really like it,"Not only lots of information about squirrels but also easy to read, not just for scientists. Nice plates. Really like it."
5,This stuff is great,"This Blistex Lip Balm Lip Tone Rocks! Unfortunately it is so hard to find, so when you do, stock up on it. I did.It keeps your lips moisturized so it's better than any chapstick I've ever used. Best thing about it is that you can use it instead of lipstick. If need be, use a lip liner first then fill in with the Lip Tone.Chapsticks make your lips feel stiff and lipstick feels like it weighs a ton on your lips. This is the best of both worlds."
3,Not the best flavor,I generally love this medicated Blistex; however the berry is not a good berry at all. Maybe that is why this one was significantly cheaper. The package came quickly and everything was intact.
3,Berry-able,"I picked up Medicated Berry in lieu of my usual scented Chapstick because it was cheaper. It's a similar 15oz tube and Medicated Berry also has SPF 15 which is important; most people forget to protect their lips from the sun. Initially, there was a soft-medium berry scent but I could also smell the slight medicinal scent underneath. It wasn't unpleasant, by far, but not as sweet as Chapstick. Since the initial use, I can barely smell the berry at all, just a hint of medicine. Again, not entirely unpleasant but I would like a bit more from a scented product.It leaves a shine to the lips and a slight waxy feel but if you're looking for colour, Medicated Berry adds none. I sometimes feel the need to reapply but never have horrible chapped or dried lips which is a good sign during the dryer, winter months.Blistex Medicated Berry is only okay. I'd pick it up if there were no other options but I was disappointed the scent didn't last because that is obviously the selling point."
3,Surprisingly good,"Though the graphics are underpar and there are alot of slow-down issues, this game is surprisingly fun and entertaining. Though somewhat similar to a Game called Oblivian, the combat is alot more fun."
3,Flawed but still playable.,"Firstly, don't buy Two Worlds for the online play. It's horribly laggy and has many other issues. Still, the one-player game is actually quite good. There's a bit of a learning curve, but stick with it and you'll start to have fun. It plays like an old-school PC RPG, maybe even a bit like Diablo. There's a ton of great loot and a huge world to explore. The graphics and voice acting could definitely be better, but the gameplay is what counts. Some people just can't get past the chunky graphics though. You might want to rent before you buy."
3,Wow.... really now.,"Well i soon as i sat down and started to play this game... i knew there was gonna be headacks in the future. This game isnt really easy to just pick up and play... took a good 2-3 hours before i got the basics of combat down... and now that i do.. that part is easy! the graphics are not as good as i thought it would be... sometimes it just looks like mud w/ shapes in it... but then again, graphics arnt everything. I like this game, but like i said, takes some time to getting use to it..."
1,this game isn't fun,"Yes, I'm comparing it to Oblivion. It's because it is marketed as 'Oblivion 2.0' by some retailers, and that is just hogwash. This is a 'sword & sandal' RPG just like Oblivion, but it is way limited in character depth and graphics. Oblivion allowed you to create a female player character in Single Player mode, this game does not - which is a good indication of the numerous limitations found in this game. Oblivion is the gold standard of this game genre, whereas Two Worlds would qualify as a tin standard. Oblivion has outstanding graphics, whereas graphics in this game look like renditions of cut-n-paste attempts at duplicating Oblivion's quality. This game sucks, and I'll be reselling or donating it. It may even qualify for the burn pile. Don't waste your money or time. Wait for Elder Scrolls V. Bethesda rocks!"
5,Do not miss this CD!,"If you love the great American popular song repertoire, hurry up and order this CD today! Julie Keim and the musicians on ""Only Yesterday"" bring these great songs to life with passion and style. I've been hesitant to buy recordings of popular songs by classical artists because I've heard some that sound like the singer is not really into the repertoire, just kind of showing off his/her classical technique. This CD is not like that at ALL. It sounds to me like Julie was born to sing these songs -- but I think she may also have been born to sing Bach, Handel, and the rest. A rare bird she is, with a gorgeous voice and great musical instincts."
2,spanish for someone? but not me,"Unfortunately the instructor assumes that because you do not know the language you must be stupid. How else could you explain the style of delivery. I think by definition that people who are motivated to learn a second language are not idiots - please don't treat us that way. I would not describe the DVD as particularly effective, but in its favor it doesn't sour you to learn more (somewhere else). I have heard CDs that almost made me want to quit learning spanish - at least this DVD does no harm. I just wish it did more good."
2,"Great Classroom teacher probably, but annoying DVD","Sorry, but I agree with the comments about him being goofy. I read that before and thought ""Ok, goofy might be good for me and my 4 year old"", but it is stupid goofy not entertaining goofy. To begin with, he starts off acting like a doctor who is abusing his patient to make vowel sounds. Then when a child doesn't get a balloon she kicks him in a campy way. He spends too much time lecturing in english, when I was hoping it would be scenes of real life to learn from. He would be great at a weekly experiential learning lecturer/teacher, but the DVD is slow, not very funny and not sure his accent is very good - The Spaniards on the street thought he was the student! I wish I had bought something more entertaining with more spanish than english."
3,Not bad,"The star of this video is a geek, no question, but he can at least keep you mildly interested. He is very energetic and tries to introduce vocabulary via a little skit or demonstration rather than just stating the word and definition. I think this is a pretty decent start for a beginning student."
1,waste of money,"you cannot get quality for little money..should have known this.boring, not useful at all!"
3,"Minimalist, un-atmospheric but strangely likeable","Ry Cooder is a great musician with massive talent and he's always Walter Hill's first choice to score his movies. I loved Cooder's music for Last Man Standing but his score for Trespass is well...ugly. It's grungy, dirty and filled with lots of strange sounds. I'm not sure why he took this particular route but it doesn't exactly match what is happening onscreen.Some tracks, such as the opening credits are in typically undeniable Ry Cooder style. Others are twisted and craggy, but they grow on you. Tho more like hemorrhoids than a head of hair. The second last track 'King of the Street' is simply awesome and is Ry Cooder performing at his best. It's worth buying the CD just on it's own. The final track is a tacky country western song that you'll like but not admit to."
3,Over the head for me,This was an advanced user book and way over my head. I purchased to try and understand the Media Player in Windows8. It is an older book and not quite up to Windows8. Will give to the Library.
3,"Bing sings standards, but not his own","In this CD, Bing Crosby sings songs that are quite possibly well known to you, but if they are, you probably don't recognize them as having come from Bing. A couple of the songs were popularized by The Mills Brothers, those songs being ""If I Had My Way,"" and ""Glow Worm."" He also sings the Ella May Morris classic, ""Blacksmith Blues."" Other terrific songs here include ""Ole Buttermilk Sky"" and the stunningly beautiful lyric, ""You Go to My Head."" Basically, whether you would want this CD or not depends on whether or not you enjoy these specific tunes. If you do, Bing should take care of the rest."
3,"Overall, this is a very strong, pleasant tasting ...","Overall, this is a very strong, pleasant tasting mouthwash. I really wanted to like this mouthwash, it's such a pretty light blue color, but I found the taste overwhelming. I used this product for the required time, but I had to water it down quite a bit to keep it from """"burning"""" my mouth. Like I said, it's strong! In all fairness, I'm not a huge user of mouthwashes, but I prefer something much milder."
3,"I didn't particularly like the flavor, but felt ...","I didn't particularly like the flavor, but felt that it did a good job in freshening my breath. My teeth felt cleaner overall, so I'd probably recommend this product, maybe just a different flavor."
5,I'm a pretty traditional kind of person and ...,"I'm a pretty traditional kind of person and have usually purchased just regular mint mouthwashes. I was always a little afraid of trying a different type, for fear it would be too strong. Well, that's all changed. The Peppermint Scope has a very subtle flavor that doesn't overwhelm. It leaves your mouth feeling refreshed and doesn't have a medicine-like aftertaste. And you still get that tingle! I'll definitely be switching to Peppermint now, and would highly recommend this product if you like a mouthwash that's extremely effective without being harsh-tasting."
5,Glass Whale,"The whale is even better in person, teh color varies slightly from the image here, but then it is glass work and that is always the case. We have several from this collection and all are great and cute. well worth the price."
4,All Mobbed Up!,"I never tire of this CD. These guys, Ohad Talmor(ts), Bob Bowen (bass)and Matt Wilson(drums) are musicians that grew up with 70s-80s and maybe 90s rock and their compositions reflect that, plus still a good deal of free blowing. Lots of open spaces and i like that sometimes. Think The Bad Plus, but with different instrumentation. Talmor is lyrical, and has a bit of a sense of humor. These are interesting compositions from a group no one knows too much about, except in NYC perhaps."
5,'MESSIAH' FOR DUMMIES,"Exquisite choral music highlighting 10 of the most familiar music from Handel's ""Messiah"". As a crash course to Handel's lengthy masterpiece, it truly highlights the essence of it's religious and secular nature. Vocals are full-bodied and lush, and the orchestra is subdued and powerful."
3,Psst . . . It's really Hickox!,"This is a fine recording, but one of those puzzles of the recording industry where the true performers are not listed on the CD. In actuality this appears to be from the recording of MESSIAH by Collegium Musicum 90, Richard Hickox, and a fine lineup of soloists. I just thought you might want to know who you were really listening to!"
1,first of all the title misspalled; another MS standard?,I guess this book is fulled of such errors!!! ha ha ha!!
4,Blue class! Tag quality great Amazon deal,"This TAG is a great example of TAG HEUERS classy, sporty line- I highly suggest owning a TAG, every detail is done with quality- of course the Blue is cheaper basically because you have to be ready to WEAR it, it sticks out, an dthe bumpers on it are even blue- if this bothers you check out white or black also awesome!great band fit and feel, bezel is awesome as well for timing activities-size is 40mm not bigger as some retailers describe, go with Amazon.com as some are questionable- you wont ge tthe warranty from TAG but a 5 year which is plenty from amazon-"
2,Impersonal Service,"I ordered a new watch and it seems that Amazon sent me a used one. They seem to provide no way to contact them. To be fair, the return process through their web site seems easy enough but it seems impossible to email anyone at Amazon to find out what's going on. Like I said the return seems easy enough but it wastes a lot of your time. It seems like they just don't care and would prefer to be an anonymous and invisible ""pure Play"" dot com. Very impersonal."
1,Save your money,"If you play video games to relax don't buy this game. The opening story takes a good 15 minutes to get through, if I wanted to read I'd have picked up a book. It uses the stylus a LOT and half the time it doesn't read what you're trying to input. I was looking for an adventure game to relax on a rare day off and I just finished Mario v DK March of the Minis. After a half hour of messing with these rotten controls and the endless tutorial text I tossed the game and gave up. Total waste of 30 bucks and 30 minutes."
2,Not worth what I paid.,"I was very upset over this game. Most of the time drawing the costumes does NOT work, the levals are to long and triesom, it's save feature is wacked out crazy. It's actually a puzzle game, there really isnt much action at all! I guess I just expected something diffrent."
3,"Meh, mediocre",This game was fun... for a while... I began to grow bored and just gave up towards the end...Still haven't beaten it... I don't reccomend
3,Hope it gets better....,"This game really makes use of the capabilities of the DS. You have to use the touch screen to change disguises and use the disguises to make it through the levels. The boss challenges really make use of all the diguises you currently have, but sometimes even if you draw the correct shape, you do not get the diguise you want. I have the most trouble with the Cosmo disguise since it sometimes gives me the Artist. There is alot of text that you can't skip, just slightly speed up. Most of my other DS games I rarely use the stylus, but with this one it's in my hand the entire time. I have not beat the game yet so I hope I'm not disappointed. I didn't like the game when I first got it, but it's growing on me. I really liked the Warioland games and thought this would be as good; so far I've been left wanting."
3,"Decent so far, but hoping it will get better",So I got this game about 4 days ago. I am on episode to now for an hour. Not sure how to end this level? But the game overall is okay. I like changing the disguises to various things. The biggest thing I don't like is not knowing where I am going or what I am suppose to do. I bought it here almost new for $[...] so I figure once I get the hang of it that it's worth about that.
5,Summertime - Criterion Collection,"The DVD product that I purchased, Summertime - Criterion Collection, is exactly what I expected in terms of quality (very good), as well as the timeliness of delivery. I will clearly be inclined to make a similar purchase in the future."
5,Katharine Hepburn more beautiful than ever in Venice!,"David Lean's beautiful film ""Summertime,"" adapted from the story ""The Time of the Cuckoo"" is a chance to see Katharine Hepburn come alive in unexpected ways. The film is shot all over Venice and Hepburn is the audience's eyes and ears to the sights and sounds of the beautiful city.A lonely secretary alone on vacation (from Akron, Ohio- I'm from Canton, so this always makes me laugh when she mentions where she's from) , she falls in love with a married Italian glass shop owner, Roberto Rossellini.Hepburn was 48 when she made this film, yet she looks probably 37, that's how in shape she kept herself. There's a scene in the film where Hepburn falls into one of the canals and after she did the stunt she got a permanent eye infection from the polluted waters.The ending is always very sad, yet very beautiful. This film is lovely to watch anytime, but in the summer it's especially beautiful."
1,Poor quality DVD,"This movie freezes on every DVD player. Neither of the two I own nor my friend's would play this DVD. It is of poor quality. From now on, I'll order from the Turner Classic Movies store directly. This was a waste of money and shipping charge."
3,A great movie if you like Venice,"I rented this movie because a friend told me about the great views of Venice. She was right about the views, but the movie was just so-so. I normally like Katherine Hepburn movies but this one was slow and predictable."
3,Bad Movie But Great Scenery,"If you like Venice, then the scenery in this movie is for you. We were just in Venice and loved it, so seeing this movie brought back good memories, and showed how Venice was even decades ago.The acting in this movie is almost laughable - just awful, as is the script, however."
1,Doesn't have subtitles,"so far peoples hard of hearing like me, pretty useless..unless you just want to enjoy the scenery.."
2,"Summertime, but not all the time","I bought this because of Hepburn and Venice and on those two counts I was not disappointed. The views of the city are outstanding and Ms. Hepburn's remarkable independence shines through. However, the story is stilted by the conventions of the era and David Lean's direction was so uneven it made Hepburn's character look kooky. Finally, I was uncomfortable with the way the movie tells the story of a woman longing for romance in (possibly) the most romantic city on earth, how she stumbles onto it, how she doesn't seem to really enjoy what she's found, then leaves the city broken hearted...just kind of blah."
2,"Great venue & scenery, lousy movie","We picked this up solely because it was shot in 1950s Venice, and we love Venice. We wanted to compare the scenes to the state of current day Venice. It being a Katherine Hepburn movie was a bonus.Wrong!The scenery is great, but that's about it. I cannot believe that Katherine Hepburn made this LOUSY of a movie; particularly at this mature stage of her career. I guess she must have either owed them the movie as part of her contract, or did it as a personal favor to someone.Turn the sound off, and just enjoy the scenery. Don't waste your time watching the movie!"
2,I've Got That Sinking Feeling...,"Venice sure is pretty. What an opportunity for David Lean to explore color movie making just a couple of years before he began creating his streak of brilliant films (Bridge On the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago). And for the film crew, a trip to Venice, Italy! Nice work, if you can get it. And now onto the story. What did Hepburn play? A retired office worker from Akron, Ohio? Oh, that's right. And the Italian lover? You know, Ben Stiller could have done something in that role (and with the script), except he wasn't born yet. One star for Venice. I'll give this flick a second star. I can't bear the thought of putting a Lean and Hepburn effort into the same cesspool as my one-star films. If you want to see Hepburn do something sparkling in this time period, check out DESK SET, with Spencer Tracy. Computers! And down-sizing in 1957! Now, that's a story."
3,An really good movie for Criterion,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD release of the film.This is a good movie filmed entirely on location in Venice, Italy. Just getting back from a trip to Italy a week before writing this review makes it more interesting. The film stars Katherine Hepburn in one of her most memorable roles. It is also filmed in Technicolor making it more interesting.There is also a memorable scene where she backs up and falls into a canal while attempting to photograph a certain building. This scene was filmed in the same location of the exterior shots of the ""library"" in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. This building is actually a church. Chiesa di San Barnaba. Located south of the Grand Canal in Venice.The DVD itself only has the theatrical trailer as a special feature but it still is a nice movie to watch and very well photographed."
3,out of sync,"I agree with the praise for this film, but unfortunately experienced the same really shocking out-of-sync problem described by the viewer from Los Angeles. I've rented or purchased many, many films on DVD and have never had this problem on my player, so it looks like the problem is with the disk. Beware of Criterion, with its perfect reputation. Since other viewers don't report this phenomenon, apparently Criterion has a significant quality control problem in the production of individual disks."
5,Summertime DVD,This has always been one of my favorite movies. It stars Katherine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi - definitely a chick flick!
5,Great movie!,"Wonderful scenery and the feeling of Venice in the Summer....Just a great movie, albeit a bittersweet ending. If this movie were made today, the ending would be totally different....I think I am going to buy it :)"
2,OLD - OLD,"I can't believe a book advertising MATHCAD 8 is still out there with windows 95/98.The latest MATHCAD is ""11"". - that is 3 versions ago. And I have read Springer books, they are okay but they are translation from German.I am suprised with the review -- this is an OLD book and it certainly shouldn't be selling for a NEW price. I had to be critical. I have 8 and just purchased 11."
2,A minor comedy with an implausible premise,"Jack Scalia plays a New York business tycoon who's married to a bitchy woman and who's unhappy with his life. He gets a divorce, shaves off his beard, loses some weight, chucks his glasses, and heads for Hollywood. He changes his name, becomes a struggling actor, and soon lands a lead role in a movie. As a premise, this is implausible, and the movie simply isn't well enough made to overcome the viewer's sense of disbelief. Its attempts to poke fun at the world of movie-making are also too obvious to generate many laughs. Jack Scalia got his start modeling skimpy briefs in print ads and he is, as usual, attractive and likeable in a shallow sort of way, and if you want to see him stripped to the waist, hanged by his wrists, and lashed with a whip, then ""Amore"" is for you. (The flogging occurs as a scene in the movie which he's filming.)"
5,Jack Scalia Rules!! Great Comedy!!Plese Put On DVD!!!,"Jack Scalia rules as a 50year old desenchanted successful businessman who quits his job,get's a divorce and moves to Hollywood to seek his stardom.It's a must see great comedy and please put on dvd!!"
3,Buyer beware ... Multimeter not included,"This review says more about me than the product.The product was shipped quickly and arrived as described. Unfortunately the photo listed at this time shows a meter which is *not* included. To be fair, seller lists ""room for a multimeter"" in the description rather than a multimeter. While I read the description this clearly did not register with me. Lesson learned ... read the fine print on all products from all sellers. NEVER trust the photo(s) supplied by andy seller on any listing.If the photo was more accurate I would not have ordered the product but other than that the experience was acceptable."
1,No English subtitles,"As the previous reviewer ststed there are NO English subtitles on this release, even though it is released by Lionsgate, a US company. Don't know if a first pressing issue but beware."
1,No English subtitles,"Do be aware that this disc is part of a Lionsgate release of classic Mexican cinema, and that there are NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES, despite the information on the Amazon listing page."
1,"Good story, atrocious kindle edition","Cave Boy was the first book I read on my own as a child. As such I was excited to find it for my daughter to try to read. It would be incredibly easy to get this kindle edition right.Even though there are probably less than 100 words in the whole story, the publisher hasn't taken the time to transcribe them so the kindle can read the text.Worse than that, they've somehow managed to screw up the orientation on such a simple book. When you hold the kindle landscape the pages are sideways. When you hold it portrait they rotate to be sideways again. You literally cannot read it upright in its current form.I will be requesting a refund. I hope the publisher can take the 5 minutes it would take to transcribe the text and fix the orientation. If they would I would give this a great review due to the sentimental value that it holds for me."
2,What is this?,"I'd like to listen to this for a second time before I review it but it was quite painful the first time around so this reflects my first impression. I can't recall one memorable piece of music from this CD. It went nowhere, said nothing, and was so unexciting I just don't know what else to say. And I am a Fates Warning fan and really wanted to like it (I purchased it the day it hit the stores). What's all the talk and pride of prog rock? I don't care, I just want to hear good heavy metal music. Whether it be Fates Warning, Dokken, or Poison. Bottom line, this CD was boring."
2,Hard to connect,"2 1/2Fates Warning helped bridge a gap between the compositional complexities of 70's progressive titans and 80's hard-rockers, and with this 2000 release still sound like Dream Theater and Tool's older, less hip brother basking in stale artistry, though in a solid context."
4,It's about time!!!,"It's about time that Fates Warning put out a good album since Perfect Symmetry. Even though I liked their recent albums, I didn't feel as though they were as good as some of their earlier stuff. With this album they went back to their heavier days, which I preferred which is surprising because bands these days seem to be getting softer with their new releases. It's too bad that Frank Aresti and Joe Dibiase left the band because I really liked their playing and I felt as though they complemented Jim Matheos and Ray Alder well. This album is a keeper for any Fates Warning fans and anyone who has never heard them before and is thinking about buying this c.d."
2,Disappointed with academic content,"I have used ""Teaching Young CHildren Using Themes"" (a similar books by the same authors) extensively in my classroom. However, after receiving ""Themes Teachers Use"" I was very disappointed with the content. I teach 4K in a public school. THe activities that I plan must meet certain state academic standards. The activities in this book were very vauge and lacked the academic depth that the first Themes book offered. I do not recommend this book unless you teach somewhere with a loose or nonexistent curriculum with no standards."
4,"Those With Weak Hearts, Use Caution!","Mr. Greske has written a fascinating story. There are many twists and turns to Bill Andersons new life in his new surroundings. Once he moves his family to the small and seemingly peaceful, town of Praire Rest, one would think his life would be happy and his family would start to flourish again. Not Even Close!Definitely a good read. Although it is a bit graphic. This book is too explicit for younger readers. Those with weak hearts or stomachs should read with caution.Recommendation: RECOMMENDEDLynn Young is the Managing Editor of MWLA, a Reviewer and Editor"
5,Great Cary Grant Love Story,"This is one of Cary Grant's best movies. If you love him, get this love story!! Carole Lombard is a great partner in this movie"
3,very little HOW and a lot of WHAT WILL BE,"the GOOD and BAD:First, THE BAD:I want to make DVD menus with flash. I thought this would show me how, but instead it was a case study of a company called ... that used Flash and a C-Programmer made a connector from Flash to the DVD-OBJECT controller. no code for that. That ..... Don't buy it if that's what you hope to find.Same with the Interactive Television stuff: Mainly a case study with no practical hows. Kind friggen lame.There could have been a section on how to create 1 flash file that works on any handheld, desktop, etc. It would have been long, but there are those of us who bought the book and were really disappointed.I think they were trying to publish the book before this one came out:amazon.BUTGreat Branden Hall stuff. that guy is who I want to be. He's amazing. other info on templates and stuff are excellent. top notch.I'd wait and NOT get this book unless you walk into a bookstore and leaf through it."
3,The book alone won't help you much --,"Swedish is fairly hard to pronounce, so I suggest getting a language instruction pack that includes a CD or cassette so you can hear the phrases as you read them. That said, you probably won't need to learn more than thank you, excuse me, hello, good-bye, and other pleasantries (although do learn them; they go a long way). Most Swedes learn English and speak it very well (save perhaps older folks who didn't go very far in school), and signs in tourist spots are often in both Swedish and English. This Berlitz travel pack is adequate for learning basic expressions and my Swedish friend gave the CD a thumbs up as far as pronunciation is concerned."
4,Review of my Gold Silk Pumps,"For the price, these shoes are good. To my amazement they combine well with most of my clothing even with the shimmer. I wish there were optional colors because I would have loved to have them in a dk blue or wine color. They are also very comfortable for a pump. This is the second pair of great shoes for a great price that I have purchased from Amazon."
4,Bravo to all concerned!,"A wonderful and insightful collection. Flos Campi may be the ""greatest"" of the works included but they are all well worth getting to know. I do wish Flos Campi used women's voices rather than boy's voices, but aside from that it is a fine performance of an astonishing and visionary work. Sancta Civitas was RVW's own favorite among his large-scale choral works, and if I find it a bit uneven in conception it's still a riveting experience. What a shame it so rarely turns up in performance! And I have to disagree with those who feel this performance is not as good as that by Hickox; I found his to be not very subtle in approach and very oddly balanced as a recording, whereas this one does very well on both counts. As for the Oxford Elegy, it's a hauntingly beautiful work that should turn up far more than it does. Roam on, the light we sought is shining still!"
1,Choose a more pleasant form of suicide,"Oy - the things people get away with based on reputation. The beginning of this CD was ok, but as it went on and on with poor verse and predictable discordant music I prayed the misery would be over soon - but not so lucky - it went on and on and on. Shoot me now!"
2,Great if you like a focus on statistics...,"I was disappointed to find the stories of Civil War reinactors regressed to Civil War lives to be a very small part of this book. The majority of this book focuses on statistics of these cases and others and the statistics are hashed and rehashed. This book reads like a thesis, which it was in fact, originally intended to be and I was hard pressed to finish it."
1,Should have remained a thesis,"I'll be upfront and say that I have no background in biology, rather physics and astronomy. But that shouldn't preclude me from understanding why two famous science authors of our era disagree on evolution.The language in this book was pitched at too high a level for me to understand and I resented this throughout. The only reason I persevered was that it is 140 pages long.In the end I did gain some understanding as to why there is difference between Dawkins and Gould, but I still have no greater understanding of evolution.This book, whilst probably worthy of merit from those within the evolutionally literate community, should not be promoted as a science book for the masses - it only serves to further alienate them from science."
5,Best product on the market,"This is the best product on the market for revitalizing your lips.For some reason, now it can't be found anywhere on the East coast of the U.S. I'm in NY and near NJ and PA and the only store selling it for the past couple of years was ShopRite...and they no longer carry it. Big mistake. It's a great product."
2,Not as good as the Fundex one,"I own the Fundex version of this game that was discontinued. In this game, the horses simply sit on top of the board. While game place is the same, the quality isn't near as good."
1,horsy go bye bye,this thing broked when i just opened the toy. i got so mad and then we went back and returned for a better game like spongebob life
4,Hysterical,"Really funny game -great premise -try to get ""in the will"" while ""avoiding a guilt trip!""Have to answer questions and perform tasks that are really funny - like ""compliment another player's clothing while making them feel bad at the same time.""Don't bother with chocolates and candy anymore on Mother's day - get this GAME!!Everyone will have a good laugh - whether you are a mother yourself - or you get it for your own mother!"
3,Interesting...,"This product was fun. However, you have to have really goofy people playing to get a kick out of it. Also, the questions were aged. I would say that if you are younger than 35 or 40, you will have a hard time getting the questions right. Otherwise, great game!"
2,"too many stats, not enuf bolts","I bought this book and read it. I hate to say it but I was pretty disappointed. It was just a big pile of names and records, a stats freaks dream but nothing for me. I wanted to know aboout the cars, the engines, how exactly did they create an AWB. I wanted more tech stuff on the cars, not a bunch of names and times.Tech talk was pretty shallow in my opinion. I will say it is a visual treasure, lots of nice pictures of these cars, and a full color section too.Neal Zimmerman, Eugene Oregon"
5,great value,This book had a personal connection to the person I purchased it as a gift for-he was very surprised and pleased.
4,Enjoyable reading,"I have read ""Bolivar: Liberator of a Continent"" from cover to cover and found it not only enjoyable reading but also most informative about the life of this great man. (bill boyd) has succeeded in putting flesh and bone on well-known historical figures. (His) depictions of them are completely accurate as are (the) descriptions of the events of the period. It is a book that not only scholars but everyone will enjoy."
3,A Dramatized Biography of The Liberator of Seven Nations,"Yes, they are seven including Guyana. A nice and easy to read biography of the most important military and statesman in the Meridian America. An interesting twist of the book is the enormous affinity and love that Bolivar felt for the United States of America, a country that he visited in 1806. He had personal contact with Lafayette, Washington, Jefferson, and had a locket with Washington's hair up to his last moment of life. Bolivar's amazing persistence, love for women [his ""musae""], physical strength in a minute body, vision of the future, generosity [he ruined himself in fighting his wars], his abolition of slavery [if not final, his conception of it] all, come nicely in this obligatory book in the Bolivar's collection."
1,Simplistic biography,"When reading a biography, one hopes to learn about the subject and its times. This book provides neither; it describes certain events but fails miserably to describe Bolivar's possible motives for engaging in his quest. It also fails to describe the political realities of the times. The only attempt is made when the author describes his teacher Simon Rodriguez's influence on young Simon. But even then, the author analysis is simplistic and totally off the mark, it attempts to convey the notion that the revolution was the result of a class struggle a la Bolshevik, when in fact all revolutions in the Americas were rebellions against exploitation and taxes from Europe."
1,Dramatized and Infantile,"Readers should be warned that this book is written like it was meant to be read for the 8 to 12 year old age group. It is not only dramatized, it is also simplified and childish at times. The back cover says it all."
2,Juvenile,"The book covers the basics of Bolivar's life but doesn't reveal much about his personality or his relationships. It is polite history that supports the mythology surrounding Bolivar that will make for exciting reading for any 12-14 year old boy, especially the battle descriptions."
1,Juvenile!,"A disappointing, juvenile biography of an important man and his time. The author, instead of describing the powerful revolution engulfing western man and how Bolivar became a leading, fervent and dedicated protagonist of this exciting age, inctead of dwelling on the Monroe Doctrine, on the powerplay between England and Spain, and other great world affairs that interacted with Bolivar's achievements, Boyd spends chapters of his meager and poorly written narrative on Bolivar's bedroom antics. Will Boyd describe 1998 as the year of the stain on Monica's dress? Sincerely"
2,The hero of South America.,"I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers. This book is written in a novel conversational format and includes a history of the Liberator. However, it dwells on the personal aspects of Bolivar, such as his sexual relations with his many women. This was emphasized over that of the many battles Bolivar fought in. After over 200 years, the battles and the ejection of Spain from the continent is perhaps more history than how many women Bolivar slept with.I am not sure I got a better idea of how Simon Bolivar was with this book. It could have better written and focused more on the history this great man accomplished. For young boys interested in history, this book may have some appeal. However for the serious historian, they should look elsewhere for readings on the Great Liberator."
2,highly overrated,"I ordered this book thinking that it might be a well written book. After all it as advertised in the New Yorker. While the high points may be correct, battles won, liberation secured and so forth, it reads like a cheerleader's report on the game: Simon scored with so many women, had the stamina of a porn actor and fought like a man on a mission. Over all I was disappointed with the book."
4,Very Entertaining Novel,"Bill Boyd spins a good tale. ""Bolivar: Liberator of a Continent,"" is a great book to read on a long flight or next to a warm fireplace on a cold winter evening.The author is a graduate of Yale and a scholar of Latin American history. He uses his vast knowledge of South American history to weave fact & fiction into a fasination account of a true ""American"" hero.In the author's note at the beginning of the book Boyd explains he uses historial documents and official archives for his personalities and actions. To that end, the dialogue in this book is excellent. It brings Simon Bolivar to life and makes this book a great read."
2,An unpolished narrative about a great historic figure,"Mr. Boyd has the elements, the idea and the admiration for a great historic figure to make a good book. Despite the author's interest in Bolivar's sexual proclivity, he did not succeed in bringing out Bolivar's human nature. It lacked the sustantive content of Bolivar's relationship to women, Palacio, his slave maid mother, Petion, Santander. This book raised my interest to learn about Bolivar. Sincerely"
2,Disappointing Book Does no Justice to Bolivar,"Having grown up in Latin America, I have always nurtured a deep curiosity about the Liberator. Prior to reading Boyd's book, I had read a half dozen books on the life of Simon Bolivar.Unfortunately, Boyd's book is a collosal failure, leaving the reader (assuming he has the stomach and stamina to persevere through this swamp) bewildered, confused, and no more enlightened as to the question of who Simon Bolivar really was. To make matters worse, this trite and superficial book actually sinks low enough to become partially insulting, by effectively trivializing the great Bolivar, and the even greater acts which he accomplished.While I assume Mr. Boyd might be an satisfactory fantasy book writer, I would ask him to please leave history and biography to authors who hold a certain respect for, and have a depth of understanding about the people and events they write about."
3,"An odd entertainment, but oddly entertaining","'The Toast of New York' is definitely an odd item - a huge budget biopic about 19th century fraudster Jim Fiske and his battles with Daniel Drew and Cornelius Vanderbilt. Edward Arnold is the right man for the role, easily overshadowing second billed Cary Grant with his force of personality, but it's hard to root for a `hero' whose aim is to bankrupt America. What next, George Soros, the Musical? It's never less than watchable but while Billy Wilder and Izzy Diamond could have turned this into a blistering black comedy, it's beyond the writers to make it work as a rags-to-riches-to-rags drama. It does have one rather beautiful song, 'The First Time I Saw You' that even manages to survive Frances Farmer's flat foghorn drone delivery."
3,Good But Not Great!,"The Toast of New York is an interesting and kind of bizarre movie that I would say is good but not great and is not Cary's best. It is one of Cary Grant's first movies though he is not the main star of the movie, it is actually Edward Arnold's character that the movie is about and the character he plays is a selfish and greedy egomaniac. A real meanie! The movie is a semifactual biography of post Cival war era Wall Street wheeler dealer James Fisk who is played by Edward Arnold and Cary Grant plays his friend and employee and the movie also stars Jack Oakie and Frances Farmer."
5,A toast for the toast,"I'd never seen the end of this film before. A small history lesson about the financial world. Grant was as usual enjoyable, and Frances Farmer was enchanting as well Fast service on this quality dvd."
3,What good is half a dinosaur?,"The amount of Christian-related pseudo-products on the U.S. market is truly amazing, or at least amazingly large (so *this* is where all that peak oil goes!). This product is clearly ""con"". The fish symbolizes Christianity or Jesus himself. The T-Rex symbolizes evolution, science or atheism. Thus, evolution eats Jesus. That's the message. Place this at your car down Klan County and watch events unfold...And then maybe not. Personally, I'll NEVER believe in EVIL-ution unless Richard Dawkins goes on national TV and shows me...half a dinosaur.HA HA HA. :P"
5,Dino Emblem,"This is a great emblem for anyone with a sense of humor. I still wish this wasn't plastic and I am afraid it will fall off the car, but it works and it's a decent price."
5,Best Bumper Decal EVER!,"It is a perfect sized bumper sticker. I have had mine of the back of my car for just about a year, and it is still sticking very well. Stays through bad Ohio weather, car washes, and normal wear and tear, and still looks great. Best impulse buy I have ever had. Great for the price."
4,sweet,Nice gift for the science beleiver. Has a nice metallic finish that can be polished if needed. Good stick too.
5,His Name is Chips,"I thought this emblem was funny, so I bought it on impulse. Only had it a few days, I'm honestly surprised it's still sticking to the back of my car. My fellow Atheist friends get a huge kick out of it, too. Just what the half-gay daughter of a pastor needs. Come up with new pieces and I'll purchase some. This one is great."
1,Anti-American Propanda,This book attempts to link disconnected half-truths with pseudologic to push an idealogical agenda. It is shocking an disappointing to me that in a time of war we allow enemy propaganda like this to demoralize our populace and troops.
4,Another good one from Art,"I've been following Art Lande's material since I used to live in Boulder, CO, and could see him and some of his friends play regularly in town. Those who know his music know that he is a great piano player (and sometimes drummer) who plays a huge variety of jazz styles. This CD covers quite the range. Some of it is closer to being straight ahead swinging jazz while other pieces are much more abstract, but there is something for almost all Lande tastes on this disk."
3,O.K.,"Well, I liked this volume, but I miss the action with Mitch and the FBI, I really like the cliff-hanger volumes, but theese stories didn't go together at all... they were funny, and had very good morals, but not very exciting."
3,Eh...,"I bought this hoping it would help my mouse-induced wrist pain.While the outside of the bracelet is beautiful (18k gold), it turns my wrist a dirty color if it sits in one place too long. I do think it has helped my wrist pain a little, though. So, if you don't mind looking like you haven't washed your wrist, the bracelet itself is quite nice. Make sure you don't get it too big, though, because it'll move around too much and pinch your skin. I have small wrists and the small was perfect for me."
5,nice,this is a great story arch. animation is nice i have never seen this before amazon got it. love it
2,I've only see the first episode.,The art work is amazing but the dialogue is awful. i don't think it's a good buy. The voice acting is good but with out a good script it doesn't have a very good story.
5,Great,The video was great. The storyline was a good twist to the comic storyline. You will also get a preview of some other marvel characters in this show. It is worth watching. I really do not know what more to say. Get it!
2,Blah . . .,This series has been done many times. The only things that really differentiate this one are the art and the rather boring plot and acting.
3,Ok anime,Pretty well done production wise but not my cup of tea. if you like Japanese anime with a dark tone you will enjoy this. personally i just like my x-men to be a little lighter.
4,Base narrower than Invacare table,"Always check the dimensions. The base of this table is too narrow to fit outside both wheels on my Mom's Lumex reclining geri-chair (petite size - about 26"" wide). We've made it work and the table was delivered in about 2 days, very speedy, so we kept it rather than pay $40/month to rent the Invacare table we had before."
4,Very good but missing one feature I wanted,"I ordered this thinking it would work well and hoping it would also swing the top indepedently from the bottom. I could not tell from the description if it did this. When I assembled it which was realatively easy even with my arthritic hands, it did not swing separate from the legs. The handle in the photo controls the verticle raising and lowering. The lowest setting is a bit high for the standard rocker recliner chair I use it next to but still workable. The highest setting is very high and it is apparent that this was designed to work with a bed that raises more than with a chair or sofa, though it can with the latter if a bit high. The bottom wheel area is less high than many of the tables I have seen but still did not fit under my chair. A good and solid product in all, but if you need the top to swivel without the legs not the right choice for you."
1,I regret EVER purchasing or relying on this product,"I bought this product a year ago because of good reviews. What a crock.I needed the space and used it to store work projects, iPod backup and older photos. All of a sudden, after only monthly backup use, it just quit working. After a trip to the Geek Squad in the hopes of retrieving 70 GB of inaccessible data, I was told they'd have to send it off to some out of state location, for $500+ and MAYBE they could access some of the data.Of course their website offered no help whatsoever. Useless product!"
3,Good,"This product performs as desired, but the hard disks will not shut off and there is no way to turn it off, so the only way to stop it is to just unplug it from the USB plug--not so healthy way to treat my data : ("
2,wrong decision,"I bought this HD because of the speed of transfer and it's reputation.i had to send it back to Ca. because the vendor,when called, did not want to deal with it.i got the new one and now that one does not work either. both drives were corrupt.Simple Tech will give me a RMA for another one but i think that to try for a third one is not a good idea.I have contacted the vendor and am awaiting word on what will happen. i hope that i will not be stuck with a bum HD"
5,The Best find of 2000,"This story could well take place in a prison or a boardroom. It's written with simple grace, avoiding all the fancy tricks. With a story so powerful, it doesn't need any. I look forward to more translated works from Mr. Munyol."
4,Our Twisted Hero,"As the narrator a middle aged man thinks back thirty years ago, when he was the age of twelve, he remembers when he moved to a new school when he was in 5th grade. He is shocked by the way the class monitor acts, exactly like a bully. He doesn't follow the class monitor and even tries to show the teacher the misdeeds the class monitor does. As the teacher asks everyone in the class about the monitor's misdeeds no one will dare to speak up. But as he tries he fails more and more, until finally he is alone and he can't stand it anymore and goes along with the group and becomes the bully's right hand man. Of course the devil never takes over the angel. A new teacher comes and he finds all the misdeeds the bully has done. The narrator alone refuses to denounce the monitor; the whole class is formed into democracy."
4,The Micro is the Macro,"The setting of this novel is a primary school, but Munyol really has bigger fish to fry. Although a bit heavy-handed at times,"" Our Twisted Hero"" provides a pointed commentary about life in South Korea during the latter half of the 20th century when a controlling government was just starting to loosen its reins.I read this book with my son (who happens to be in the fifth grade like the main characters in this story). We focused on the immediate story and enjoyed the book well enough without exploring the bigger connections. Munyol's tale is a slow-moving one, but it's thought-provoking and makes you keep turning the pages. Some have called this book a Korean ""Lord of the Flies."" Although less violent and gripping than Golding novel, I think it's a fair comparison."
4,not for the faint of heart,"Some criticize this book difficult because of the strong emphasis on grammar. But grammar is the ticket to understanding, and if it's not your strong point, don't bother learning Latin. Get some tapes or software and learn a modern language that you can become immersed in without a heavy grammatical emphasis.If you learn best in a no-frills text, Wheelock will be perfect. Many textbooks today include colorful photos and pop culture references, but Wheelock is dense, with little room for fluff.The translation exercises are taken from classical sources, so you get some exposure to Roman culture. The short historical and literary commentary at the end of each chapter is a nice, unobtrusive way to tie things in to the bigger picture of Roman culture, but it doesn't affect the focus of the course."
4,Still using it!,"When my professor assigned us this book for first-year Latin I groaned -- no pictures! That was back in 1992, and I'm still using the darn thing. In my 8 years of study I have used many books, but this one has been my constant companion, and I feel that I passed a graduate test in Latin because of it. For self-study this book is invaluable. The lessons are thorough and you can grade yourself with the self-tutorial exercises and answer key -- a definite plus to this book is that it has an answer key so you can see how you are doing. There is also ample reading material, some of it altered for the beginner, some of it unaltered so you can test your wits.In short, I must grudgingly admit that this is the best book I have used, all around. I gave it four stars because it lacks pictures, myths, cultural tidbits, etc. But there are other books that have these things; for grammar, syntax, etymology, all the mechanics of Latin, you can't beat it. I highly recommend it."
4,One of the better foreign language texts I own,"Several reviewers have attacked this text for using shortened versions of latin text, which is exceedingly unfair. This is an introductory text, and as such, accomodations must be made rather than using the entire text out of some elitist notion(as a parallel, how many children know the real nursery rhymes?). Also, the physical quality of the book has been assailed, which I see as baseless and without merit; its just as quality as any other paperback book. The text itself is straightforward, and fairly easy to read. Little time is wasted on cultural issues, which to be honest, I find refreshing (I study ancient history and find it implausible that a book purporting to teach latin could also do a half-way plausible presentation of the attached cultures and periods). Overall, a good text."
3,Although not flawless this book is helpful,"This book is helpful in learning Latin basics, but starts to become confusing in the latter chapters. An adequate amount of time has to be invested in the book else it will not be helpful in the least. The summaries and dictionary in the back are two features which are very helpful."
4,Not a Perfect Text But Good For Beginner,"Despite of all the negative comments and even the severe attacks on this old text, Wheelock's Latin offers one of the better text for beginning Latin students. Adaptations and abbreviations from Latin prose are understandably and reasonably quoted as a paced guide to learning the language. Grammar is explained in a very easy-to-follow manner. I recommend this text for beginning students and those who wish to refresh the basic grammatical rules of Latin."
5,Really the best Latin grammar,"Wheelock's Latin is simply the easiest approach to the declensions, conjugations, and other grammatical constructs of the language. Latin is probably one of the easiest languages to learn, anyway, considering the number of roots words we extrapolate from English, and this book orders the lessons logically and easily. Take it from me, I've failed or dropped classes in Spanish, French, and German, and then I took Latin in high school as well...and failed that too. But then in college I took it again, only this time using the Wheelock version, and ended up getting a bachelor of arts degree--yes, in Latin. Since then, I've taken Ancient Greek and Old English, both of which have similar structures, and I've had successes in those as well. I still have my Wheelock text, though now it's old, faded, and the pages (after 15 years) are falling out, but I treasure as one of my most prized books. If the Wheelock text can change my mind about language learning, it can help you too."
5,Drunk driving is preventable,"This segment clearly displays the human cost of drunk driving and should be used as one powerful video against people who decide to drive under the influence. Is it murder? If you are a family member of someone killed by DUI, you would definitely agree that DUI is murder when a rational person shows little or no regard for other people on the road. I knew people who were killed by drunk drivers and I will always consider their deaths murder."
2,Not a good value,"i teach alchohol highway safety school for DUI offenders in PA, and bought this dvd to use for educational purposes. it was not worth the money i spent on it ( a 20 minute clip). it is informative but overpriced."
3,More Hollywood Horror Muzak!,"After the resounding disappointment of hearing Dave Arnold's ominous by unimaginative Godzilla theme, this compilation of theme covers becomes a kitsch classic of sorts. The Jaws Theme is not what you'd expect, but is a pepped up melody of the themes John Williams composed for Jaws 2 and hearing the music redone as a peppy dance nightmare will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. This album is strictly for fans of classic kitsch misfires like Pat Boone's In A Metal Mood ONLY!!! Serious fans will recoil in horror at the sound of Music from Scary Movies! :)"
5,:):):):):),Love this fixture! used it today in drywall for a very heavy mirror!!!! I was able to do it myself!My husband was outside came in to do it and it was done! He was so impressed with the product and ME!!!Another added bonus!!!! would recommend this for everyone that need this application.Mrs. Dish. Joannie :)
5,Could Hang like a Horse,"This product could seriously be used to hang a horse, ***NOT RECOMMENDED*** i used it to hang a Horse Painting that my friends mom painted. Framed and all it was 20+ LBS and this slick device did the job, when their were no Studs to be found."
4,Great for Youth Groups,Two years in a row we have done Christmas programs out of this book. Lots of options of all lenghs and both plays we did had Christmas lessons for the congregation but laughs also. I would recommend this to any youth leader looking for Christmas material.
2,Mediocre.,"Very disappointed at the content of this anthology. I was hoping for something more engaging for an audience, but many of this pieces were simply boring. If you are a church group, public school, or an organization such as these, it is a nice anythology, although the plays lack tension, comedy, and intrigue. The pieces are very ""cutesy"" and might bring about an ""awww"" from some audience members.There is, however, enough content to give you some leeway in terms of production. My production company ended up staging a comic version of ""A Visit from St Nicholas"" so it wasn't an entire ""waste"".Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, but approach with caution. Borrow it before you buy it."
4,The Very Best of Judy Collins,"i bought the cd for one song only, Both Sides Now, and it was just beautiful. Most of the songs are lovely but """"from both sides now is wonderful... icecream castles in the air.... it looked like love from both sides now,.... and still somehow, its ......."
2,Not the same product as pictured.,"I expected to get the updated version of this product, but did not. what I got included the OLDER greatest hits, not any of her later career. A rip off."
3,A little disappointing,"The Very Best of Judy Collins-CDMaybe I remembered Judy Collins more positively than she was, but this CD was somewhat disappointing. There is a ""sameness"" to many of the songs that makes listening to the entire tape a little wearing.JGR"
1,The very bad of Judy Collins,"The CD was so disappointing that I gave it away after listening to it only once. I bought it because I love the song ""Both sides now"". Ironically, it was introduced to me by a friend who had it on a cassette tape years ago. I ordered this CD on line. It's full of noise! It sounds like it was duplicated from the old tape and no digital re-mastering was done!What a waste of money!"
5,Sounds of the 1960's,"This album shares some of the best sounds of the 60's. Judy's gentle voice gave so many people so much pleasure, and it still does. She has such a unique presentation to be cherished for generations!"
4,The best of and not the most popular of,"One of the problems of ""The Best of"" type albums is what someone else thinks is best is rarely what you think is best. The songs on this CD are all very good. It is the absent songs that irritated me. Most notable by its absence is her song about the Colorado cowboy that was played by radio stations much more frequently than many of the songs included on the CD."
1,Bad Recording,"A horrible recording on CD. They've turned her voice into an echo chamber while the instruments remain basically the same.I know Judy Collins was vocally flat,,but this is an outrage. Yes, I have the original Vinyl disk to compare it to. You folks justdon't know how to record music. Horrible production."
1,Defective Toner,"This new in the box toner is making streaks on all the printouts from my Laserjet 1200. I've tried cleaning the paper path and it's still streaking. And since I didn't install within the 30 day purchase window, I can no longer return this defective item.UPDATE: Amazon let me return and order a new toner. No more streaks with the new toner!"
4,"If you need it, get it here","Only have to get one ever 2-3 years, got to love these laser printers.Please recycle you older unit to local stores that will give you a store credit for it."
1,"Defective, printed all black","Do not buy, mine printed all black, replaced with one from Staples and printer worked fine. Don't waste your time the price IS too good to be true."
4,I like this mouthwash. It has a pleasant ...,"I like this mouthwash. It has a pleasant taste, but I can tell that it works too. It's very tingly. It tastes a lot better than some mouthwashes and I find it more tolerable. I like to use it morning and night. It helps morning-breath a lot."
5,Scope for your mouth!,I had to use this for my teeth b/c i'm grown up and adults might get cativities. I learn that in health class. I'm only 14 yrs old. I'm old enough to make reviews. Buy it!! Recommendation: People with unhealthly teeth.
3,"Not ADA approved, Better is out there","Scope is alright for freshening your breath, but you could be using a product that helps fight cavities, rebuilds enamel, removes plaque and prevents gingivitis. After using Scope for years, I did some casual research after a doctor recommended ACT to give my teeth a fighting edge against cavities.I found that Listerine and ACT both killed bad breath like Scope, but they also did so much more. I also learned that Scope is not American Dental Association Recommended (as are some forms of Listerine and ACT).Scope gets your breath fresh fast, but you could be doing much more for your oral health every time you swished."
3,I feel that this product was not quite ...,"I feel that this product was not quite on par with my regular product (Listerine). Although a good product (Scope), it wasn't as strong as I would have liked. I prefer a strong mouth wash over a mild one. However, I'll continue to use Scope along with my regular brand. Who knows, maybe I may switch if it grows on me!"
2,wordy book on billiards,"I just wanted a basic book on billiards and billard etiquette. This book is too big and wordy. I guess it is a good book if you are considering purchasing a billiard table, as it goes into great detail about what to look for, etc. I wanted just a basic book."
3,Side Talks,"Good book, but it comes with a lot of side talks, more than the real information that you will learn. Some my prefer this way, but not me. I always prefer to get direct info."
2,This is the Original Studio Version,"This is the Original Studio Version and not the one that was released to the general public and shown on TV since the 1950's. Many of the famous speeches are different; weakening the impact of the film. The speech Grant made about Germany wants Peace, a Peace of Poland, a Peace of Holland, a Peace of France is missing entirely. It is too bad that this is the version that is currently available as, I believe, the other is more powerful."
5,Great DVD,This is a great DVD with wonderful quality. A romantic comedy yes but also has espionage as the backdrop. Cary Grant shines and Ginger Rogers is just so cute as the love interest. The plot definitely has substance! Highly Recommend!All of the Archive Collection DVDs are available from the Turner website for $17.99. Please support Turner with getting more classic movies onto DVD.
1,Very Disappointing,"This is a pale imitation of the film released to the general public and shown on TV since the 1950's. I was very disappointed to find many of the most famous speeches removed, weakening, and destroying the impact of the film. I can not recommend this version for these reasons. Don't be fooled by the Original Studio version. It is not as good as the one most people remember seeing."
5,"Another wonderful read,","Veda Jones produced another 'great escape read' for me. Structure and character development are again excellent. I particularly enjoyed the relationship between these two strong characters. Please keep the good books coming!!! I have an entire summer to relax, read, and relish good writing."
4,A Fine View From This Mountain,"In this sweet, diverting story, Veda Boyd Jones clearly demonstrates her skill as a writer. Fully realized characters. Plot twists and turns deftly handled. I can't say that I'm a fan of romances, but, with apologies to Sir Paul McCartney, Ms. Jones's book is no 'silly little love song.' Reading it is time happily spent. I recommend it."
4,Romance Novel,I enjoyed it very much. Very touching story. With a nice ending. I will look forward to another novel by Veda.
5,Incredible!!,"This is the best artbook I have seen. The art inside is sheer beauty, and the way you go through the book is so intriguing, exactly like the series. You don't really have to know Japanese either, all I do is sit down and enjoy the book."
4,PLAX ANTI-PLAQUE DENTAL RINSE,I tried to find this product but could not find it anywhere so i thought i would look here and sure it was here. This is the exact item i was looking for. I am not sure why you cant find this now at the local stores. It was sent and recieved when they said it would be. The right size that was needed.
5,The Andropause Mystery,"Robert Tan obviously writes with both feet in the water, sharing not only from his experience as a geriatric clinician, but also as a scientist-researcher in this poorly publicized topic. Particularly interesting are the true-life case histories, many of whom I easily related with, and thereby enabling me to connect intimately with the points being put forth."
2,BORING with pointless JOKES,"I read this book hoping that it would be good but I was dissapointed in it. It's a pointless story with jokes, recipes, and a boring story about how to divorce your husband and still stay with him. I didn't like the ending at all. It was sort of a let down and the story was boring. Very few of the jokes were funny. I'm glad that I just paid a dollar for this book at a supermarket for charity. One good thing the money went to a good cause. Save your money on this one."
2,Huge let down,After reading and listening to all the Sweet Potato Queens books...my expectations for this book of her sisters were very high. Highly disappointing. The woman reading Judys story is horrible. The content very dry in most places and hard to listen to because of it dragging. Would have been better (when listening) if the author would have read it herself. There would have been an authenticity to it. Did not find it funny or really entertaining. Would NOT recommend.
4,3.5 HD Enclosure,3.5 Enclosure 3.5IN USB 2.0 Hard Drive EnclosureGood purchase & product. Shipped in timely manner & complete satisfaction with item.
5,Astonishing,"This is a magnificent recording of a great work that often defeats performers. Barbirolli approaches this music as a red-blooded drama, almost operatically, and his singers cooperate in bringing his vision to life. Richard Lewis does an amazing job, sounding so weary of life in the first part, as it slips away from him, yet sounding reborn thereafter. Kim Borg's English pronunciation leaves something to be desired, but the dark timbre is perfect for the role of the Angel of the Agony. Janet Baker's Angel is incredibly wonderful; if she does not break your heart when she sings ""Softly and Gently"" you should probably sign up for a transplant. Sure, there are some things I could quibble about, but the overall conception is so brilliant and the music-making so inspired that it shrivels complaints into insignificance."
4,magnífica grabación,Llevaba mucho tiempo tratando de conseguir El Sueño de Geroncio y ha sido la primera vez que he utilizado este servicio. Ha merecido la pena. La grabación es magnífica y es una versión diferente a todas las que había escuchado. La calidad es estupenda aunque sea una grabación que tiene ya unos añitos.
1,ever wonder why some tools cheap and some are exspensive?,so I finially understand why the price is so much less for this than a comparable Stabila for example....thsi level is horrible...why?...the vials don't have a curve to tehm...there straight vials...which means that they don't react as well to minor shifts in the item being leveled...which translates to severe problems with accurracy...we found such a problem my crew is not allowed to use this for anything other than a large straight edge...its really that bad...spend the money on the more exspensive Stablila.
1,The worst Ripete collection,"I loved Ripete's first box collection, and it's the standard by which all others are measured. But this one is a joke. Why not more classic-era beach music lie the first set? This has too many post 1980 songs, too many cover versions, and far too many songs by groups that are not beach groups - not even close. In short, not a lot here, and certainly not worth the money."
2,long winded and haute,"I am taking an alternative certification program. This book was required.The book does have useful points. However, it is poorly written. The author was too wordy and used terms, not jargon, that made the reading all that more cumbersome. I quite frankly found myself losing patience with it and only skimmed the book just enough to get through the class."
3,Pragmatic.,"Good book for education. Module 8 is a little old school, but overall very practical and necessary."
1,book review,"I was required to use this book in a college class. There was nothing in the text I did not already know. The format is strange. There are very odd exercises in the book. This text is overly wordy, there is nothing educating in this text. This was by far the worst education text I have ever come across."
3,Woof Woof,"If this book ended around page 200, then you would have a tight little story about small unit action in Iraq. Granted there were cliched characters and predictable story lines, but a tolerable read.Unfortunately, they had another 80 pages to fill, and here the book embarks on a fantastic global plot that defies logic. It read like one of Ludlum's wheels within wheels within wheels plots, but without a reasonable basis.The main reason I give the book 3 stars is that the writing is pretty good. The pace moves along, even when it roars over the deep end."
2,Sorry and sad,this book never took off it was boring from start to finish..if you enjoyed last of the dog team as i did then you will be disappointed with this one....
5,Very Comfortable Pullover,"The Nautica pullover is a very comfortable shirt that I at the time only purchased to get free shipping on an order because i only needed something else small. I was suprised at the comfort and quality of this item at such a low price. It says ""Sleepwear"" but would make a great top layer when its a little chilly outside. Definitely not a replacement for your ski-coat but price and quality considered a great buy."
3,"Bad Artwork, Bad Sound Quality, GREAT Album!","""Too Close To See Far"" is a great album. Don't be fooled by the terrible cover art (the worst I've ever seen in my life; what were they thinking?) or the less-than-incredible sound quality of the recording, this is a really, REALLY good effort. I haven't heard the band's other albums, so I can't compare it to anything they've done in the past. It's a good purchase if you're into melodic ""jangly"" rock 'n roll."
4,Interesting view on the Bohemian movement,"This text is supposed to cover the conversation of a group of people during an evening of ""Bohemian"" discussions. Each person tells their own little story or gives an ideal to the group; however, none interact with the others, they simply talk over and around each other. I think it creates an interesting feeling of ennui and disaffectation with society as a whole, which perhaps sums up the entire Bohemian movement. Will be of definite interest to many people."
4,Good Stuff for Dry Lips!,"I get really dry lips from extreme weather, so bad that it makes my lips look very ugly and scaley and I also sometimes get a painful spilt in the middle of my upper and bottom lips that sometimes bleeds a little and I find that this Blistex stuff is the only lip stuff I can use that works on getting my lips to look good and not all ugly. This medicated lip stuff stings my lips a little and the medicated smell can be a little strong but it isn't too bad and I like how nice my lips look after using this and I would use it again!"
5,the sweetest leather cases around. go reptile!,i have bought so many of this specific or the other phone size cases that they sent me a free one. These are beautifully done with a high standard of excellence and they look rich and sophisticated. lots of options for all size phones and ipods.
5,Fantastic,"Really Fantastic! I used to listen to Tom Grose & The Varsity live at Timothy John's in Atlanta back in the 80s. I have the original (white cover) album signed by all the original band members. It is a Special Pre-Release, one of 1,000, with Thanks to Tim Ecclestone, Barkley Geib and the Staff of Timothy John's. It has been well played through the years and I was worried I would never get to hear the original sounds again. I was happy to see the CD available. What a great band with a great sound!! I miss those days!"
4,Very good for the money,"I purchased this exercise bike for my sister who just had a baby. I wasn't expecting much for the price. When my siter received it and put together the bike, she was amazed. It's very heavy duty, it has a computerized screen and is quiet as a mouse. The only complaint she has it that it seemed to have resistence even though the resistence is set to zero. Other than that she loves it and so does her husband."
2,Only mediocre,"This book has some lovely photographs, but is very short on any real detail or practical information on making a japanese garden in your own home. I found it much less useful than the Ortho book on Japanese Gardens. I would not recommend it. There are better books for appreciation and better practical guides."
1,Waste of money,"This book is not about Japanese gardens, whatever the title. I have read a lot of books about Japanese gardens but the content of this book is not in concordance with what other authors write about Japanese gardens.Foto 4-7 is referred to as a bright, flashy and colourfull Chinese-style gazebo in a cultivated Japanese garden. The foto though shows indeed a Chinese-style structure but the garden shows a two-tier fountain with a manneke-piss on top .... in a Japanese garden?The foto's are nice but nowhere are there descriptions given of what it is or where it is.Then there are a lot of fotos of beautiful acers, but nowhere is there a connection to the text.And finally there are the drawings and the maps/designs. The drawings, to me, are basic but ok. The maps/designs are terrible: they are inconclusive and no time nor effort is put into it to make them at least look good or in any way professional.To me this book is an absolute waste of money."
5,"Metal classic, best of the best","Don't need to say much more than what others here have already said. Imagine a 12-year-old boy from Hong Kong going to a Christian school in rural Washington state in the early 80's who had never heard of metal before, let alone something like Iron Maiden. Imagine the pastor projecting the album art onto a giant screen inside the church, THE CHURCH! and then went on to play the title track at full blast. What an experience! I was instantly converted! Up the irons! (Paul Di'Anno's previous two albums were awesome too, but the Number of the Beast had the power to convert me. It was sacrilege and exactly what I needed. Thanks Maiden!"
4,Hmm...,"Maybe I'm just weird, but I think that arguing over music genres is stupid... I think that the I love Fall Out Boy chick was being kind of ignorant too, but arguing over music genres in general is pointless, especially when you have no idea what you're talking about. Like the person who responded to the I love FOB girl, who said Fall Out Boy and Taking Back Sunday were 'pop-punk-emo', which is a total load. Anyway, I happen to be a fan of TBS and FOB and ALSO Iron Maiden. That being said, this album is absolutely amazing."
5,The defining Maiden album,"Iron Maiden has produced many great albums, but come on, we all know this is the one that really put them on the map. And it's easy to see why. This is Maiden's best album ever, and if you are to own only one Maiden album (which I hope that's not the case, as Piece of Mind and Seventh Son are quite good), this would be it."
3,"Great album, poor remaster","Love this album. Bummed about the remaster job. Loud, shrilly, and no dynamic range. Would have given it at least 4 stars if not for the poor remastering. This must be the fourth or fifth release of TNOTB on CD and no one has gotten it right yet. What shame.As a side note, the remasters for Piece of Mind and Powerslave, though also compressed, sound much better."
5,Awesome album,"The number of the beast was the first album withBruce Dickinson and their 3rd album.This is a classicmetal masterpiece and this also one of the mostpopular Maiden album's.I don't like to write long review'sbut what more can you say I mean it's Iron Maiden.This album is a must own for every die hard fan.I still listen to this album at least once a month.They have other awesome album's that I listen to allthe time.Iron Maiden rules!! They are also one of thebetter hair band's of the 80's because they played realmetal.So buy this album now,what are you waiting for?"
3,Good for Iron Maiden,"Iron Maiden have only a small selection of excellent cds. Somewhere in time being the very best! The number of the beast has a couple of excellent songs such as Hallowed be thy name and run to the hills. The rest of the songs have a lot of high pitched yelling and it can get on the nerves. But the coolest thing is that Iron Maiden are touring with DIO in the summer of 2003. Iron Maiden always have the most awesome stage show. Official tour dates are up already and I know for a fact that on August 13, 2003 they will be performing in Dallas Texas at the smirnoff center."
2,"Great album, poor packaging","Why the low rating? Well, it's a 5-star album, one of the best albums by an excellent band, but the packaging is terrible. Check out the large version of the cover art and you'll notice that it is not the original art. It's been cropped at the bottom and removes the flames and most importantly the Eddie puppet in the devil's hands. This hurts the overall effect (that the devil thinks he is controlling Eddie, but Eddie is the one truly in control) of the artwork and shows an overall shoddy production. I'd seen this before in stores and am confident it's not just a problem with Amazon. A shame too, but hold out for a better version instead."
2,Different type of metal,"I just don't understand why I don't like this band too much. It's sorta disapointing that I don't like these guys cause they're so popular and stuff. I guess it's because of the vocalist that I don't like Iron Maiden or it could be that it's sorta old school metal, which is what this is. I'm given this 2 stars for respect reasons but a warning, this is unique for metal and I'd listen to a sample first before buying. You might not like Iron Maiden."
2,Buy Killers and Iron Maiden instead - This is HYPE OVERLOAD,"From the time you get into Maiden or when you first hear of them you'll feel like you have to have this. Maybe, and this has a few, few moments. But even the classic bits like Hallowed reek of that operatic cheese that is best left to the cheese fest lover. If you like this most likely you will also be the type to listen to Savatage, Accept and a load of other cringe-worthy lame poser style metal bands that ought to be laughed at.Not one song is a true keeper, though the first half of Children of the damned is close. You'll get bored of the remaining songs in time.Buy the first two Maiden albums, those are their best. They are great 3 decades later, this one isn't."
2,Re: Renagade,"When talking about singers who are superior to Dickenson, Renagade forgot to mention the talents of Geoff Tate of Queensryche.Geoff Tate makes Bruce Dickenson sound poor by comparison.Compare Tates scream on the song ""Queen of the Ryche"" to ANYTHING Dickenson has ever done in his carrer and you will see how Poor and overrated Bruce is, Bruce can't even hold a candle to good 'ol Geoff Tate."
3,5/1/3 5 Good 1 Bad 3 Ugly,Invaders 1 of the 5 good. A highlight. Not the best though. Introduces Bruce's sound.Children of the damned 1 song in between. 1 of 1 bad. Slow ballad type.Prisoner 2 of the 5 good. A highlight. One of the best.22 Acacia Avenue 3 of the 5 good. A highlight. Close to the top.Number of the beast 4 of the 5 good.

Continued bad period.Total Eclipse 3 0f the 3 ugly. End of bad period.Hallowed be thy name 5 of the 5 good. Possibly the best here.Conclusion 5.5/9 61.1% 1*=20% 3*'s.
3,Iron Maiden - What a joke.,"Yes, a joke. Some of the most cliched driven lyrics this side of hard rock, Iron Maiden, though a very technically efficent band (something every metal band tried to be in the 1980s), is nothing short of being... Yes, OVERRATED. This of course is strictly my opinion. You Maiden heads are more than welcome to wax all the greatness you want with this band. Even if I still can't see how anybody would/ could take this band seriously (that also includes Judas Priest and to a lesser extent, Megadeth)Rock on.. I guess."
2,A Star For Each Fully Realized Tune,"There are only two of them on this album --- Number of the Beast and Run to the Hills. I was going to impose an additional star penalty for the pain caused by missed opportunities, lack of rehearsal time, and just plain lazy sloppiness ---- but I'm generous. The difference between the filler and the good tunes is so distinct that a serious listener would swear it's two different bands. One that has learned to play a solid fully developed tune - together in tempo - and one that can't keep simple 4/4 rock timing. I was actually quite surprised at the disparity in quality on this album as well as the lost potental of several poorly executed tracks and others that are just plain filler. I recommend downloading single tracks when it comes to Iron Maiden --- some of their tracks are outright classics."
1,MOST OVERRATED ALBUM BY MOST AVERRATED BAND!!!,"I can't understand why people call this a masterpiece; it's BOOOOOORIIING, most of THE SONGS ARE LAUGHABLE and after a few listens,the album DON'T TELLS YOU NOTHING. Perhaps this album is great for some closeminded metalheads, but for me is NOTHING SPECIAL. I would recomend KILL'EM from METALLICA and SIRENS from SAVATAGE, which are WAY BETTER than this AWFULL RECORD.Buy KILL'EM ALL and SIRENS and BE BLOWED AWAY."
1,This is what you should get if you are a joke with no taste.,"This band is not talented at all and is a complet joke. Honestly, how can you people listen to this satanic goth garbage? This guy on the bass Harris or whatever the hell his name is, cannot play at all and is a complete lozer and does not look kewl at all(he looks like an ugly gurl). Thats why this band is not on MTV or the radio and also becaue it sux. This is exactly the kind of stuff that comes mind when I hear the words ""fake metal"". For a real metal album that has talented playing check out ""Nevermind"" by Nirvana or Limp Bizkit's masterpiece ""Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water"". They rock way harder and better than this unkown poser tripe that I would give minus infinite starz if I could."
4,Iron Maiden take us to hell!!,"Maybe the greatest and most famous Iron Maiden CD ever written, in my opinion not comparable to Piece of Mind and Powerslave, but still very enjoying and exciting!!A must-buy for all!!"
4,Great,"I can I say that haven't been said about this album?Very good, still a reference for heavy metal."
5,The best album of Iron Maiden,"Really this album is the best album of Iron Maiden... It's the symbol of the band... It has powerful and legendary songs like ""Run to the Hills"" (super !!), ""The Number of the Beast"", it's an amazing song , and it hasn't any ocult relationship with Demon... it's only a song !!!Later, they released a DVD with the same name to explain word by word the meaning of each song....I'll recommend this AudioCD ..."
5,"You get to see another, more somber side of ""archie""","As a boy growing up in England and having an estranged relationship with his mother, I believe this was his way of going back to his roots and being the son he so desperately wanted to be. He gives an air of hominess to the movie. It really seemed like he could have been living the part. You can also tell that there was a lot of raw emotion pent up inside of him that he didn't let just anyone see in his other comedic roles, this one was very close to his heart, and being a Cary Grant fanatic, I like the fact that he let everyone see a glimpse of his real self behind all of the glitz and glamour of hollywood. It took guts to relive the old memories."
2,What a shame!,"What a shame that the more baker writes about virginia kelley, the whiter her protagonist gets. I know that many young, black professionals take on the trappings of the white middle class as they are assimilated, but i had hoped baker would avoid this. the plot is believable, but might have happened to anyone regardless of race. In our society filled with institutionalized racism, it would be good to have a black lesbian hero who is really black. Maybe baker should check out the hero of Valerie Wilson Wesley's mysteries. She is straight and less affluent than Virginia, also well-educated but very black."
1,HIGH POWER CONSUMPTION,"I totally agree with Anthony from Beverly Hills, Ca. :""Great Features, but HIGH POWER CONSUMPTION PROBLEM....THE LARGEST DRAWBACK ON THIS CAMERA IS THE HIGH BATTERY CONSUMPTION. This IS NOT THE CAMERA TO PURCHASE FOR ROADTRIPS UNLESS YOU HAVE 4 SETS OF BATTERIES. This camera drains batteries like a Vampire drains blood on his victims. I purchased this camera and the alkaline batteries lasted only about 15 minutes. I then placed a new set of RECHARGEABLES into the camera and for some REASON the Battery Low INDICATOR lit up in only 5 MINUTES (SEE RAYMOND MOK REVIEW, NOVEMBER 22, 01 who had the same problem)and the camera shut itself off. Sadly, I returned this camera and purchased the Olympus 3040-C, my second choice. Like Raymond Mok said in his review also, I MISS THIS CAMERA.""I miss this camera as well, but it was not worth the frustration!"
5,The Software,"The camera itself is excellent--the software I got for mine is almost impossible to use--way too complicated and contradictory to the printed manual. I`ve noticed this before with Minolta stuff--Great hardware, extremely confusing software."
4,Resisting the deification of Ronald Reagan,"While Georgia representative Bob Barr continues to wage a war to name at least one national monument in every state for Ronald Reagan, including the Washington Metro airport stop, a few historians have maintained a more skeptical look at the defining moments of the Reagan presidency.The Reagan papers were scheduled to be released on June 21 of this year. Barring access to them, this is one of the very few books that attempts to tell a story of a presidency without gushing like a teenage girl with a crush. A great man can withstand critical scrutiny, and Haynes Johnson has given Reagan that chance---and finds Reagan coming up short of the lyrical reviews by Peggy Noonan and others.If you want some substance for your next discussion over the deficit legacy, Star Wars, and Iran-contra---useful since many of the participants are alive, well, and in power today---you should find this book interesting, regardless of your actual politics."
1,Inaccurate and just awful,This book is merely a hit piece on Reagan blaming him for ever percidved failure both real and imagined. That Haynes Johnson thinks of himself as an impartial reporter is a pathetic pretense. Which he uses just to hide the biased and rabid liberal that he is.
4,An American Dreamer,"This book is quite revealing about the typical left-leaning worldview of its author : his interpretation of recent facts and its fundamental lack of any understanding of economics such as believing that the financial industry is not wealth creating. As such it is an interesting read.Although I don't share many of Mr Johnson's views I did enjoy the book and of course it's not the facts that I would dispute (deficits, Iran Contra etc.), but their interpretation and their selection.To be slightly more concrete about the leaving out of facts let me state one that I was amazed not to find any mention of: Reagan's role in accelerating the decline of the Soviet empire by confrontation rather than accommodation. He was thought of as a dreamer when he called to Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall - well the dreamers saw it come down."
2,Why blame Reagan for everything bad?,"Some less-than-fortunate things happened in the 1980's, but many less-than-fortuante things happen in every decade. It seems Johnson wants to blame Reagan for Wall Street goons, weather problems, a supposedly poor economy(which data and history show is totally false, the Laffer curve was correct), and a fight against South American communism, among many other aspects of those years. Why didn't he just look at this nation in 1975-1980. It wasn't pretty. By 1988, America was an economic powerhouse with world superiority and a beacon of freedom and democracy.Was Ronald Reagan a perfect president? No, but who is? He certainly is one of the best of the 20th century, though, even if Johnson disagrees."
3,Good but not great,"I recently saw Seventh Day Slumber at a Skillet concert in Knoxville, TN. I bought there CD when I was there and I thought they were great at the show and very hard rock and sounded like 12 Stones or Demon Hunter but when I bought there CD I found the studio found them more sounding like Kutless or Everyday Sunday. That isn't at all a bad thing just not what I expected. After I got over that I found it to be a very good album the only thing I thought it was missing was that one great song that makes the CD complete. Its a bunch of average to good songs but its missing that one really good song that completes the package on a good album. It sounds to me like a collection of B-Sides. Still very good and I would recommed it to any Christian Rock fan who likes music in the middle between say Kutless and Skillet there right in the middle."
5,I like Slayer and Black Sabbath,"O.K. here's coming from a 30 year old life long metal head; buy this album. I love heavy metal but the lyrics of typical heavy metal are often harsh (not always) but it's nice to be able to include some pros into my music without compromising the heavy metal music that I like so much. It's positive heavy metal, go figure. But please if you grew up in the 80's, don't even think about this band being another Stryper, oh no, not even close. If you have kids who like heavy metal, slip this into their CD player...I know I did."
4,Energetic Christian Rock,"I had never heard anything by Seventh Day Slumber until I saw them in concert when they were warming up for another group; they were pretty good.This album combines some power rock sound with some positive, meaningful lyrics. I think that this sound would appeal to many fans of secular rock as well as Christian music fans.There are three particularly good songs in this collection: 'Shattered Life', 'Caroline', and 'Oceans From The Rain'. Two others that are pretty good are 'I Believe' and 'Masquerade'. The others are ok, but nothing special.If you like a heavier sound, this would be worth checking out."
1,once upon a shattered life let me down,Well I heard my first seven day slumber song I realy enjoyed it. I went out and I got the CD and I'm really dissapointed. All of the songs sound the same. At first I thought it was just because I wasnt use to the CD yet but after a while all the songs blend.Seven Day Slumber still need alot of work.
4,Good but not Amazing,Definatly a good solid cd worht buying. But most of the songs are somewhat forgetable. Overall the First 3 track make the cd worth it. But there are better christian rock bands out there
4,Rolling Stone,"Rolling Stone magazine just reviewed the Streetwalkin' Cheetahs new cd ""live on KXLU"" and gave the cd a 4 STAR Rating."
3,average,This is a good shampoo but I did not notice any difference in my red hair. It faded the way it always does.
3,Does it do anything?,"I am not sure what I was expecting or looking for, but I am not so sure this does anything.Other than the fact that I must use 5 pumps to create a lather in my very short hair, I suppose it works like regular shampoo. I was told, paired with the conditioner, that this would help preserve my red. How can I tell?As a regular shampoo, this isn't awful. But does it really serve a dual purpose? I don't think so."
4,Great if you can afford it,"Keeps color reallllly long, good product, just a bit pricey...you need to use many many pumps to thoroughly clean long hair, so the bottle will probably last 8-10 shampoos. That's fine for me since I only wash my hair twice a week."
2,"Fine, not great.","I realize that this DVD is step by step, however for beginner's the instructions are confusing and visually it is confusing also. It is very difficult to see what area of the body she is referring too, because the camera angle is wrong. The approach of this instruction also seems to be rather goal oriented rather then being about peace and movement. Tiffany's perfectionistic manner makes this rather less enjoyable than it should be.As a beginner, I find other DVD's of Tai Chi to be better, such as ""discover TAI CHI"" with Scott Cole, AM & PM workouts. My goal starting out, was to increase flexibility, balance, and reduce feelings of stress."
2,A Big Disappointment,"Tiffany Chen is the daughter of Yang Style Grand Master William C. C. Chen, and an outstanding athlete in her own right. So this video had the potential to be an excellent learning tool, particularly since they had a mirror image option which reversed the instructor's moves. Unfortunately, that potential is totally destroyed by artsy-fartsy camera work, overly dramatic lighting and backgrounds, and a constantly changing viewer perspective. I found it impossible to use, even as a backup to my weekly classes.As a work of art, it's not bad. As an instructional video on the Yang Style of T'ai Chi, there are better."
2,WHAT???,"Maybe fancy camera tricks are cool, but they are a burden when you have NO idea what is going on and are trying to learn something. Here's a hint: Let's NOT focus on the face when the whole body is moving. Let's NOT focus on a side angle when the opposing, blocked, leg is moving. And so on. Also, Ms. Chen, perhaps actually describing your movements in layman terms for all of us who have not been raised by a Tai Chi Kung Fu master would be helpful. Kthxbai ...I'm a total noob to Tai Chi, and really want to be successful. This video is NOT for you if you have NO idea what you're doing. Thank goodness I got it as a freebie from another site!"
1,Garbage...pure garbage,I just can't say anything other than this is just a bunch of garbage for anyone hoping to do anything along with this DVD. Save your money on this one and use it to go buy an ice cream to reward yourself for not wasting it here.
2,enough with the camera angles!,"I love Tai Chi, but this video is confusing because of the ""creative"" camera work. It makes it virtually impossible to see the form in it's entirety."
2,Which ways which?????????,"I really wanted to learn tai chi so I brought this DVD because it looked pretty easy plus it said for beginners. I just wanted to say I felt like a child trying to learn my left from my right for the first time. Don't worry I laughed at my self to, trying to keep up."
2,Disappointed,"I found this DVD to be too difficult to follow. The biggest problem I had was the constant camera angle changes. By changing the angles I'd end up not knowing which foot should be where, how twisted I should be.... and I was also disappointed about the instructions - when do you inhale, when do you exhale. Perhaps I just expected too much from a beginning Tai Chi DVD. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a local Tai Chi class, other than one for seniors, and that happens while i'm at work."
5,Step by step Tai Chi,I am taking beginning Tai Chi class and this DVD really helps me remember the many individual steps when I practice between classes.
4,Step by Step Tai Chi with Tiffany Chen,"It is a good video, at times slightly difficult to follow. Makes me feel good after finishing the steps."
2,Not sure I'd recommend,"This is my first experience with Tai Chi, but this video is very hard to follow. Not sure it's the best approach to learning Tai Chi."
3,Advanced Tai-Chi Forms even for beginners,"Although instructions are detailed, they require lots of repetition before they could be mastered, especially for beginners like me. If one is truly determined, disciplined and devoted plus has the time to learn it all, then this is where you can get all 60 very difficult Tai Chi Forms. DVD quality is somewhat wanting and DVD menu is a bit difficult to navigate esp since one may need to keep stopping, rewinding, pausing or do frame by frame. Try to recruit an assistant to handle the remote while you try for the movements."
1,Qualified Teacher - Horrible Instructional Video,"Obvioulsy qualified instructor.Camera angle changed randomly and was not focused on the movement.Voiceover did not tie to movements, stated wrong leg or arm repeatedly. I am even adjusting for the mirror image (when she says move right leg and she is moving left leg so you can see your self in a mirror.)Camera switches front to back, and to side and to face and to scenery, but rarely on what you need to see.Impossible to follow..I threw it out and bought a different one."
3,Ok...Not Great,"I think this dvd is well presented except for one thing, which is the voice over. Every time she say's left she means right and right is left. (At least on my dvd) Taking Tai Chi for sometime now I realized this months after going to a Tai Chi school and practicing it. My Dvd, during the instructions, when she is talking about putting the weight on a specific foot or leg, she is talking as if you are in front of her not behind which would give you the correct leg. If it's just my dvd someone let me know or do anyone else realize that happens."
4,What's with all the camera movement???,I love this dvd...but I sure wish they didn't keep moving the camera around so much. It made it difficult to see the if I was turning to far and exactly where the weight shift should happen. She explains it during the lesson but when the camera shifts it makes it confusing. Aside from that this dvd is great. She explains how and why the breathing is important and how to take what you learn and make it your own.
2,Not pleased,"There is no doubt she is an expert, but with the mirroring it was totally confusing, she'd say right leg but move left, I've practiced the short form many times and understand it but her DVD left me bewildered."
3,General Info.,"This book was also an interesting read. I was hoping for more technical information. Still, is good for new bikers and a good reminder for old ones."
5,Great read,"A very good read, and a good add-on companion to Proficient Motorcycle.There's a little overlap, but not much, and it's well worth it.Personally, David's riding tips/style is much more suited for me than someone like Keith Code.Highly recommended."
4,Motorcycling skill advanced course,".This book is a furtherance of your motorcycling education, read this after ""Proficient Motorcycling""."
3,Why are E-books exempt from proof reading?,I only read a sample of this book so far and I'm not so sure I will read the rest in digital format. The amount and type of typographical errors was disturbing. The first book was excellent and i loved how helpful it was as i am just starting into riding. I really hope there is a print edition of this book without the terrible lack of proof reading that the kindle e-version has. Otherwise(and I'm sure sure this doesn't contribute much) I thought the book looked very promising. I will be looking for a physical version.
2,Binding fell apart,"I read the first book ""Proficient Motorcycling"". It was informative andmostly accurate. The advice was level headed and sound.This book repeats a lot of the material in ""Proficient Motorcycling"". So,for those who bought the first book I would advise them to buy this oneused, but the copy of ""More Proficient Motorcycling"" which I boughtcompletely fell apart at the binding. All the pages are now loose leaf.So, my recommendation is to just keep your money."
3,Filled With Typos,"According to my Kindle, I am only 8% complete with this book, and I know that I've counted over 25 typos so far. It's as if no one proof read this book before publication. Perhaps it is just a poor translation of print-to-electrons, but still a poor presentation. The typos don't distract from the content, but it's just frustrating to have to deal with such poor quality."
4,Good Material,"Good Material but be warned the Kindle Edition has some weird typos, missing pictures (of hand signals) and repeated sentences. FIX IT AMAZON!"
4,Recommend for any motorcycle riding addict.,"Recommend for any motorcycle riding addict.Just makes you think about so many things that you do that could potentially be risky every time you ride your bike.This book just covers so many areas of ""THINK ABOUT IT STUPID""."
4,Wisdom from the Master!,"The first ""Proficient Motorcycling"" had color pictures and evidently they saved money with this one by using only black and white photos throughout.It just makes the second book look a bit chintzy in comparison. Some information is rehashed from the first book, but the author has so much knowlege, that it is still hard to put this book down.Mr. Hough covers pretty much everything you need an explanation for and his writing style is very easy to stick with for long reads. Definitely the authority on motorcycling and how to do it properly and safely. No regrets in buying this book. Well worth a read if you want to improve your riding skills."
2,Bad Binding Great Content,Well written and informative. Binding is terrible. I returned the first one because of all the pages ungluing from the binding. I was extra careful with my second copy but the same thing happened. I am going to have to return this copy too.
1,To short to be useful,"The blurb describes this as an ""article."" In fact, it is barely three paragraphs and is far too general to be useful. You can get more by doing a search on the web, so save your money."
2,Average tale of family relationship troubles,"This is not the sort of book that I would normally read. It was given to me by my mother-in-law, who said it was a pretty good story. Well, after reading the first few pages, I could'nt put it down, I dont know why, but I had to keep reading. Its basically the story of four then five generations of women livin in the same house throuhout the sixties,seventies and eighties. One of the main themes deals with child abuse. In this case an over possessive father channels his unwanted attentions on his young daughter over a number of years. This culminates with an attempted sexual assault on the daughter when she is sixteen. I feel the whole subject of child abuse was only lightly investigated and a lot more of the pain and trauma assosiated with this could have been written about in more depth. In conclusion, as a light,quick read, I would recommend this book. But if you are looking for something deeper, then dont bother."
5,Interesting study of important information,"This book is based on a Canadian study that can be brought into U.S.A. classes. The information can be used in various social sciences courses. It is a good read of the information. The book is also a quick read and makes this a very good prospect for using it for more indept information for college courses studying this demographics. My students appreciated the information, as it added a good depth to our class discussions."
5,I wish there was more!,"I absolutely LOVED this series. Cook's writing is clever and her characters become real in the reader's mind. I was captivated by the writing and wish there was more to it however Dawn Cook is very good at tying up loose ends.Alissa Meson stumbled upon the Hold not knowing what she really is or believing in magic. During her studies to become a Master of the Hold she and her instructor and companions find that she has an uncanny knack for doing the impossible. This includes contacting another Master over half way across the world in her dreams.Alissa sets out with three other companions to find the lost Masters of the Hold and bring them home. However, her quest to rescue the other Masters could hold her doom.Despite this odd review I highly suggest you read the series and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
5,Beloved by John Paul II,"This beautiful book is a loving tribute to the Blessed Mother through the words of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II. His devotion to Mary is wonderful to behold. The book is ideal for devotional or inspirational reading."
1,Catholicism is not Christianity!,"This review comes from an adult raised as a Roman Catholic, now a Reformed Christian.This book is full of false teachings as is the majority of the religion of Catholicism. The true Gospel no where teaches that a figure such as the pope should exist. Jesus is our high priest! Nor do the scriptures teach that Mary, the mother of Christ is our mediator between Jesus and God. Nor does the Bible teach that Peter was the first pope, that we should pray to saints, or that Salvation is through works.I pray for all Catholics that they would pick up the true Christian Bible and read it and that God would help you understand that the religion of Catholicism is not a separate doctrine of Christianity, but an entirely different religion."
4,short of expectations,"A good book written by a great man. Yet, I expected much more from a man who had risen to the papacy. One might want to consider the other side of the `John Paul Coin' - Albino Luciani or John Paul I - the valiant champion of human dignity for women, orphans, the remarried, homosexuals and others whose everyday lives are scorned by doctrine. Unlike his successor who was taught from an early age not to question the authority of his ancestors, Albino received his commission to rise to the papacy and bring change to the Church at the age of twelve from his revolutionary activist papa. Two good men - yet, two very different men - two very different sides of the same coin, John Paul II the conservative side and John Paul I the liberal side. I would suggest a look-see at Lucien Gregoire's PAUPER WHO WOULD BE POPE."
2,Don't buy them,These things are very pretty - but a major PITA to solder to - and melt too easily - connector pins break easily - stick with the standards - This thing isoverpriced junk - Switchcraft at half the price is 3 times better..
5,The Good Life,This is a life changing message; timeless! I recommend it to anyone trying to make sense of their life and purpose.
4,For each Man/Woman to figure out,This is a very good book that speaks to the Christian Worldview and the impact that living for Christ can have on the individual and on the world in which we live. I have always enjoyed the down to earth writing of Mr. Colson as he shares his walk of faith and the impact he has had on the lives he has touched.
4,A bold attempt,"Colson tries to lead the reader from desiring the good life to accepting Christ as Lord. Colson narrates stories about his life experiences and the life experiences of others to very good effect. He also uses Lewis's moral arguments and the logical design arguments to argue for the truth of Christianity. The book, by its very nature, has to present these arguments at a superficial level. The book keeps refering to different movie plots, especially ""Saving Private Ryan."" To argue truth from a fictional movie plot doesn't work for me; thus, I substracted a star.The book does a remarkable job of presenting the reasonableness of Christianity and how Christianity is the only way to meet man's need for meaning. It would be a good book to give to non-believing friends."
5,Another great example of God & Colson's story!,"This book in another great example of how God works! Mr. Colson is truly insightful. In ""The Good Life"" he easily lays out the basis for all to understand what real truth is.I had dificulty putting it down!BDP"
3,Christian Voodoo,God is bigger than the bible and personal. Do you really think Jesus would be in the market selling the latest interpretations of the dead sea scrolls and wow a gossip column on a preview of the new testament? Learn to love UNconditionally and show by your actions and example and youll do just fine on this planet. peace dog
2,I would have rated this better if ...,"we had not read this in our small group Bible study in conjunction with the Wide Angle Bible study. Taken in this context:1) It's not very Biblical. It's inspirational and vaguely religious, but not Biblical. This does not make it a bad book at all, but it does make it a questionable choice for a Bible study.2) Despite being mandatory reading for the Wide Angle Bible study, it has only the vaguest connection with the material covered in that study. Again, that does not make it a bad book, but I have wonder why it is required reading for the Wide Angle bible study. If you find your church has mal-invested in the Wide Angle bible study, you can save yourself time and money by not buying this book. You won't miss anything at all. Many people at my church agree with this sentiment!"
5,Good Colson Read,"I loved this book. Chuck Colson has always been one of my favorite authors. To me, the difference between this book and his others is its simplicity. Much of his works are deeply intellectual. The Good Life is more simple and personal. It was very enjoyable."
5,Good Life Thinking!,"Chuck Colson has taken the stories of peoples lives and used each one to cause the reader to reflect on the true meaning of life. These very unique and amazing stories, used in perfect sequence as a lawyer would to convince the jury to come to the right conclusion in a trial, create an important journey for the reader in coming to grips with our ultimate purpose in this world. I never read anything twice, but this book has changed that! Unforgetable stories coupled with thought provoking questions. Mr Colson is a very bright man and excellent author!"
4,Robin Trower - 'BBC Radio One In Concert' (Windsong),"I think I remember this VERY show that was recorded in 1975 showing up on the long-gone but not forgotten weekly broadcast of the King Biscuit Flower Hour. So nice to to be able to own a copy on CD. Features the following line-up: Robin Trower on guitar, Jimmy Dewar on bass / vocals and Bill Lordan on drums. One track on this disc that I simply don't remember but really liked is ""Alethea"". Also ""Twice Removed From Yesterday"" is great to hear as so is ""Bridge Of Sighs"" and ""Day Of The Eagle"". Today, Trower still tours and records regularly. I've seen him live once and the man can still deliver the goods. Great timeless '70's rock & roll."
5,Film School in a Book,"I attended author Eve Honthaner's class at USC in 2004. Titled ""Breaking In, Hanging In and Making It,"" the class gave me all the skills and tools necessary to make it into the film industry in Hollywood. Her encouragement and burning desire to help people succeed in following their dreams translates well from the classroom to the page. For those who don't have 6 weeks and $2,000 to spend on her enlightening course at USC, this book is a real bargain. If you are serious about pursuing a career in Hollywood, ""Hollywood Drive"" will teach you the importance of networking and all the other skills necessary to get your foot in the door. Using the tried and true methods of Eve Honthaner, I got my first job in Hollywood with Fox -- and many more to follow. I now recommend this book to everyone who dreams of Hollywood and has the courage to pursue that dream."
5,Show business....the way it really is!,"For those considering a career in the film business this is a ""must read"". All the training in film school doesn't give you the nitty gritty about the ins and outs of the business that this book does."
3,Fighting Ace,"This movie was pretty good. Not as good as Struggle Through Death or Invincible Armour which was, in my opinion John Liu's best that I've seen, but it was good."
3,"Loved the handle, didn't care for the brush","Nice big handle and a fun large size. Brush doesn't hold much paint. We used them to make yard sale signs on posterboard; was disappointed to have to dip into the poster paint more than once for each letter. (We switched to another brush and didn't have the problem ... so it wasn't the paint.) Also, it was hard to get a straight line or firm end -- two features you might expect from the shape of this brush. Might be great for kids using easels and watercolors (probably its intent), but not great for uses requiring more control.However, they're great looking so we had no trouble selling the leftover unused ones at the yard sale."
1,Very disappointing....,"This is wretched -- watered-down early-'80s jazz-rock mood-music without even a good beat. Only ""The Mask Maker"" comes close to the quality of Group 87's 1st album -- THAT album is a 5-star classic, every cut's great. Dramatic, wide-screen cinematic music with gorgeous melodies. Buy it instead. This will not even wake you up...."
3,Color on photo is not what you get,"This item was a hard to find finger pull that fits over a keyhole. I needed it to open the lid of a secretary instead of having to use the key all the time. It arrived in a very bright brass finish instead of the antiqued brass pictured. I had to make a separate purchase from the same site for a product to darken the color to antiqued brass. So I ended up paying more in shipping costs than both items together. If I had know I would have to darken it, I would have ordered the items together and saved the extra $7.50 in shipping. Anyway it does look great now and works perfectly."
4,You can never go wrong with a transformer that looks like a corvette.,"This amazing toy looks exactly like a corvette.. exactly. I have always loved transformers and this one is no exception. it is a little tough to transform at first, but it gets easier. these transformers alternators are the coolest transformers to come out sinece the original ones when i was like four."
5,Educational and Thrilling at the same time,"Because this was the first Pike book I read, it reigns as a favorite. Because I am a fan of Greek mythology, this book was a learning experiance as well and entertaining. The final scene couldn't get any more thrilling. Delos was an excellant place to plot this book in, it just makes you want to go there now"
2,Weak,"Interesting premise, but nowhere near his older works. Seems Chris is more interested in pumping out several books a month than concentrating on style or plot. And where the **** is the sequal to the Cold One promised oh so many years ago? I am a sadly disappointed once fan."
3,Could be better,Josie and her friend Helen (both 17) go vacationing in Greece. There she discovers her friend and her are possessed by Ancient Goddesses. When the two finaly realize it they fight to the death. Does the word ridiculous mean anything to Mr. Pike? This book was poorly written!
3,Delos and Mykonos,"I'm not sure how I came to buy this. Probably the Greek island background. I now see that it is directed at young adults, which explains the rather simple language. I was inclined to sneer at the simple writing style at first but he knows how to keep a plot moving and the pages turning. The plot involves reincarnated Greek goddesses and the protagonists are young people visiting Mykonos. It might be of interest to a young person planning a trip. Provocative, but not explicit, sex."
2,Come on!!!,"It took me three years to try to finish this book because it was SOO boring. Who needs to hear about the plane ride to Greece??? It took forever just to get to the ""good"" stuff. This book was very very poory writen. I think Mr. Pike has done ten times better with his books. Most of his other books I would like to read again...but this one just makes me want to give it away just to get rid of it in my posession. Sorry, Mr. Pike, you could have done way better."
5,this is one of the best books that i have ever read.,"This book was beyond great.I am Greek so i was fasinated by it from the start. It was a sad, suspensful, romance. all of the ingredients of a perfect book. I loved it!"
4,Your Patience Will Pay Off,"This book was extremely well written and captivating, but it moved too slow for me. I do highly reccomend it; if you do read it (and you should) be patient, read all of it, (don't skip chapters like I did the first time) and I guarentee, that if you're a fan of Pikes, the boring parts will fade to a fantastic, original novel."
5,Most Gentle and Relaxing,"I recd the Healing Touch CD as a present. I enjoyed it so much that I have bought several of the CDs as gifts for friends. It is the most gentle and relaxing CD. I use it to calm myself as I drift off to sleep. And, if I am having an anxious day, I will lie down and let the gentle sounds just wash over me and help me to calm my breathing. It is a magnificent CD. It would be a great gift for yourself or for a friend."
5,Soothing,"I have had this CD for almost a year now and it is always in my Cd player. When my grandson comes to spend the night with me, he always ask me to play the ""sleepy"" music for him. At Christmas I bought him a CD player and his own copy of ""Healing Touch"". His mom says he listens it every night and she has no problem getting him to sleep."
4,relaxation music,"It is a great relaxation cd. most of the songs are beautiful, there are one or two, that are not my favorite, but overall it is a wonderful listening cd."
5,A great live performance!,"An amazing value for about six dollars! This CD provides some great takes on some great tunes. Where else are you going to find ""Floyd's Guitar Blues""?"
5,Quality Fence Controller,This Red Snap'r fence controller has been operating flawlessly for about 3 months now. It replaced another Zareba controller which failed due to lightning. I have about 1 1/2 acres fenced with the controller using portable fence wire. Voltage tester indicates 7000 v+ at either end. It should last many years if I can keep it protected from lightning.
5,Tamiya paints,"Tamiya paints are fantastic. If only they were easier to find. For some reason, Amazon classifies this product as a toy which it isn't."
5,Let's reissue this CD,"There's no sense in my telling you what a great album Soul of a City Boy is. I bought the record in 1965 or so when it came out and played it to death. I still have it but don't have a turntable. I recently sat down to think of some folk albums I owned as a kid that I'd like to buy on CD, and Soul was at the top of my list. So I headed to Amazon and found it was available--for $140!. Seems they put it out on CD, then discontinued it. This album needs to be re-re-released on CD at a normal price for Jesse's aging fans.If you agree, go to JesseColinYoung.com and ask that he put this out again and let the speculators eat those overpriced CDs."
3,War or Peace?,"This book I think is about getting along with Muslims.It is written I thought to make one better understand them.A good writer ,well written,but I'm not sure if I agreed with everything this book had to say. check out my book about a similar topic-Sharper Than A Two Edged Sword-by Nadia N. Rehmani.you can find it on Amazon as well."
3,pool shooters,"An okay clean movie, not one of the Cash's better ones. Not enough pool shots for my liking, unlike The Hustler and Color of Money."
5,Johnny cash rules!! Great movie!!,"This is a great movie about a pool shark meeting his son at a charity competion with both of them trying to combine their financial and professional resources in order.Starring both Johnny Cash and June Carter,we all love and miss you both!!!!"
5,The Baron and the kid,I like the movie I use to shoot a lot of pool so it remindes me of my yonger years and the Baron can really can shoot some pool I still do Play on line pool games.
4,Works!,Not much to say. Pretty simply - it works as intended. Handy note holder for the car. Shipment arrived quickly with no issues.
4,Good and Bright when you need it!,"A friend gave me his old Surefire a few years ago and I was hooked. These are an excellent line of flashlights. I bought one for each member of my family for Christmas. If you would like a light, handy flashlight that illuminates an entire room, get this."
1,"Cheaper to buy, but expensive and unreliable bulbs.","This model is cheaper than the 6P, easier to grip, and is easier on the teeth if you hold it in your mouth to free both hands.However, the bulbs are unreliable and quite expensive to replace.A nifty toy, but not a tool you can rely on or keep running economically.If I had free bulbs and batteries, I would give it 5 stars."
3,its okay,mine is 4 years old and is still running today with no problems. its quality and dependable but today its very weak in output and battery life
4,Good and Bad,"This is a great flashlight for short usage periods. If you need one to stay on for hours on end, you're going to have to spend a lot more money. I got mine from Gander Mountain and paid about 40 bucks for it. It looks like Amazon has it for a lot more. I use it while I hunt and for home security. It's also great to carry around because it is so light and weather resistant. The only down side is the battery life. They say it lasts up to 60 hours but it's probably closer to 30-40 minutes. You can still go a month or two without changing the batteries if you don't use it every day. Another down side is the cost of the batteries. I wish I had done it at the time, but Gander Mountain was offering 12 batteries free with the purchase (mail-in rebate). Good overall flashlight! I recommend it."
5,Great!,"My husband loves these flashlights! We have them in every room of the house and in our cars. Very dependable, reliable, and tough!"
1,Worst Heroine Ever,"Clare Cummings is one of the worst ""heroine's"" I have ever read. She was such a poor excuse of a bride I hoped Justin would leave her! Sure, romances need plot. And I have to admit I find the bride who won't sleep with her husband really boring. But Clare said she wanted to have a real marriage but she sure went about it in a crazy way."
4,ALL THE GOOD INDEED,"I think the leaves were pretty much history by the time their second lp was released. The 'garage band' sound that dominated the first record took a more mellow/psych turn here, and the band made a record that still is infinitely listenable all these years later. Pick it up before the out-of-print prices take off."
4,A handy book for the ukulele fan,"Jim Beloff is a one-man ukulele rennaisance who (among other things) collects old ukulele tunes and edits them, adding chord symbols and publishing them in books like this. This particular collection is one of my favorites, along with Beloff's ""Ukulele Gems"". Both books offer around 30 tunes and a very complete set of chord charts for the price of a couple of sets of strings. Not bad."
1,Not very useful,"Jumping Jim books are a mixed bag. Some are pretty good (the Campfire book, the '60s book), but this ain't one of the good ones. For some reason, Beloff wants us all to change key and tune A-D-F#-B or F-Bb-D-G, instead of the conventional G-C-E-A tuning (which was inscribed on the stones Moses brought down from Mount Zion).If you can follow the finger patterns without looking at the letters, or follow the letters without looking at the patterns, you can get through, or you can transcribe. Either way, it's work I don't want to put in for a bunch of meh arrangements of meh songs."
2,Why all the different tunings??!!,"This would be a great book if one didn't have to retranslate all the tunings. Several different tunings are used in this book, so the only way one could play these songs in a sing-a-long setting would be to take them all and recopy them for the C tuning. Darn- there are so many good songs in here, but I haven't had the time to do the afore-mentioned task yet (and in doing that, the chord diagrams would be useless - you would have to just know them), and I've had the book for awhile. Why Jumpin' Jim - why??"
3,Review of Itations,"This is a good book for learning about the Rastafarian culture. Although it may not be great for a beginning read, it gives lots of cultural information from a Jamacian's viewpoint. I would definetly recommend it. The knowledge is somewhat confusing, so be sure to follow it up with other books or a conversation with someone versed in the religion or culture."
4,PRETTY PICTURES,"THIS BOOK IS FULL OF PRETTY PICTURES THAT GIVE YOU THE FEELING THAT YOUR RIGHT THERE IN JAMAICA. ONE THING I DIDNT LIKE ABOUT THE BOOK IS HOW LITTLE INFORMATION IT HAD IN IT. THERE WERE SECTIONS IN THERE THAT WERE VERY INFORMATIVE BUT IT WAS PREDOMINATELY A PICTURE BOOK. ANOTHER THING IS THE LAYOUT AND OVERALL SIZE OF THE BOOK, ITS KIND OF SMALL I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BIGGER. BUT STILL A GOOD BOOK OVERALL! READ IT AND LIVE IT!ONE LOVEJAH BLESS"
5,A wonderful reference book on Sterling silver jewelry!,"I have been searching for a reference book on sterling silver to help me determine prices of jewelry I want to sell. This is a wonderful book with value guides on a wide variety of sterling jewelry from many companies and countries, including hallmarks and histories of the companies. One thing I wonder about though, is why the price of the book is so high (anywhere from $50 to $500 no matter where you buy it, according to my own internet research) when the publisher's price tag on the back of the book is $24.95. My copy has updated prices from 2005, so the book is only 7 years old. Irregardless, I am very happy to own this book and recommend it highly."
3,Collectible Silver Jewelry: Identification and Value Guide,This was a general book on Silver and I felt it did not go into depth. I do not like it as much as others but it covers many country silver jewelry.
5,Still Dreaming about this album,"I picked this album up on cassette at Longs Drug Store in Monterey back in 1985ish, and was instantly hooked. So hooked that I picked up every one of Mr Klugh's albums religiously for the next 20 years. He is such an incredibly talented artist. I am ashamed to say that I've only now begun to convert my collection over to cd. The Dream Come True album holds so many special memories for me, in fact, in 1986, I named my new puppy ""Doc"", and that loyal pooch's personailty fit that tune's melody for his 13+ years on this Earth. The beautiful words at the end of ""I Don't Want To Leave You Alone Anymore"" still stir me up, and every single tune on this album takes me ""there"". Bravo and thanks to Mr. Klugh, thanks for sharing your dream with us."
5,Witty blend of solid wedding tips & hilarious true stories,I found myself laughing out loud at Brantner's descriptions - I could barely put the book down!
1,Zzzzzz,"Save your money, unless you have absolutely no common sense and can't be trusted to plan a wedding. This book does not offer any info that you couldn't get from asking ANYBODY that got married in the last 10 years. Every chapter makes a sad attempt at humor by using the typical stereotypes of a beer swilling, no-brained groom-to-be. Maybe this book would help out the immature 17 year-old that's having a shotgun wedding, but if you've been involved in anybody else's wedding..save your $$. This book is downright painful."
1,Rose colored leather Fossil watch,"I received this yesterday. After I set it to the correcttime, it did not run. I tried two or three more times andcould not get it to run, so I am sending it back. It is an attractive watch."
5,I take it daily....,"I started using this after listening to a health segment on NPR about a year ago... have no complaints and I feel better using Glucomannan - my weight stays constant. I took one of these capsules and emptied it into a cup of water to see what it did, and it turns the water into a jelly... so it definitely works!"
2,Caused indigestion and sleep disturbance...,"This fiber caused very bad indigestion and sleep disturbance for both my husband and I the few times we tried taking it, regardless of time of day or dosage. It also gave me bad flatulence. We ended up so frustrated that we couldn't take it long enough to experience it's benefits and ultimately agreed to throw it in the garbage. We are both early middle age and healthy and fit regarding our eating and weight."
5,Great Product,I've been paying a like more in a store for a similar product. Plus I had the inconvience of having to go to the store. This was more economical and convenient. It arrived on time and was well-packaged.
2,Buy this is you like having gas,"I bought this product because Dr. Oz recommended it to help you feel full, lower cholesterol, and also to help with constipation. The directions recommend taking 3 capsules before each meal with plenty of water. I did this and not only did it not make me particularly full, it gave me terrible gas and did not help with bowel movements. I dropped the dosage down to one capsule and got the same results. Plenty of bloating and not much else. I've done this a half dozen times and am about ready to throw in the towel on this product. A waste of money, in my opinion."
1,Quite disappointed,"I have never wanted to lose weight quick; I just wanted to lose weight s-l-o-w-l-y and keep it off. After doing hours of research online, I came across this product, to be taken 30-40 minutes before breakfast and again before lunch, which claimed to give the user a sense of fullness. Well, I ordered three bottles because they were so cheap in price and -- with some suspicion as to their value -- started the program. I started taking just one cap to see what effect it might have on me. The next day, two caps. Third day, three caps as recommended. I have been taking three every morning with my regular coffee for a month now and I detect absolutely ZERO FEELING OF FULLNESS. Therefore, I conclude that the product does not work for me."
1,Vart,I hated this product!!! It didn't do any of the things it described! It makes you extremely bloated all the time.
2,Didn't really do anything.,"It came on time, was as advertised, as good as any other product. However, it just doesn't really do anything, you may as well take a sugar pill."
1,Not a pleasant experience,"If you have been constipated for a long time, this product will clean you out. I do not recommend as it was bought thinking it was a fiber supplement. I did not enjoy using the product. Cheers!"
3,good bowel movements,"I tried this product after seeing it on Dr. Oz. I have been taking it as directed on the bottle, I did not find it to cause a feeling of fullness, however it has worked wonders on my stubborn bowels. I take it with the recommended amount of h2o and a apple and that helps me have a good BM later in the day. I have not experienced any additional gas or bloating. I am currently satisfied with this product for fiber purposes."
2,Am I too stupid or it is the book too abstract to read?,"I bought this book because its fine printing and attractive title. As I brought it home and read the details of this book, I found out I was wrong. The whole book seems to designed for those who have excellent logical thinkings. The author try make his own graphic charts to explain the deep side of the Flash usability. The problem is, it makes the flash even complicate after reading it. If you are a person with strong Logical thinking you may enjoy this book, and if you think you are not, just don't waste your money."
3,Disc won't play correctly on older DVD player,"We bought this DVD for the Harry the Dirty Dog cartoon and we are happy with that one and the others on the DVD. The problem is with the DVD menu system on one of the discs. On our older (Go Video) player, the menu will not come up. The disc starts playing at the beginning of one of the special features and when you try to get to the main menu, it goes right back to the special feature. We tried exchanging discs, but the new one did the same thing. This also happened on a couple of the other DVD's in the Scholastic series. The do play fine on our DVD recorder, but not on our older player."
2,Not as great...,"When compared to some of the videos and DVDs that Bat Conservation International distributes, this DVD is not that impressive. The camera angles could be better. It's definitly not worth the money! You'd be better off buying an educational video from BCI-they are less expensive, better quality, and much more exciting and educational!"
1,Takes up space with no really good games just monster things,"This to me had a lot of demonic games of killing cheating not really anything of interest to me. It is not really a ""game"".Not a good buy."
3,coming of age,"A girl coming of age, a problem child. Its well acted. Jaclyn Smith is a judge and she gets mixed up with a girl from Juvenile hall. It tells a good story of fostering a kid. Well acted."
4,Charming,I recommend this movie because it shows how one person can make a difference in someones life.
2,Ordinary Miracles,This movie was not well acted or written. The message was good but there were too many mistakes made during the film.
3,Ordinary Miracles,A film of hope. One person can make a difference in anothers life if only we allow ourselves to give.
3,Very easy to rust,"Pros:The wok is big and deep and perfect for cooking Chinese food.The price is very good.Cons:Very easy to rust. If you are leaving any moisture in the wok, it will turn into rust. Sometimes when I was cooking and had to use it for a long time, the steam from the wok will creat some rust on the top of the wok....Also, if I am cooking vegetables only, there will be a strange sour smell blended into the dish. I know all these will prove that the wok is made of iron, and iron is supposed to be good to your health, but I really want something that is less messy.The wok cover is very easy to get hot, so be carefull when you are using it! I got burnt several times."
1,High Hopes! Arrived damaged!,Arrived damaged and only refund was offered. At least Amazon paid for the return shipping and gave me a full refund.
1,Not for serious improvisers,"As ""Whose Line Is It, Anyway?"" becomes more popular, and more improv groups begin performing in high schools and colleges and bars, it's discouraging to think that many new performers will turn to books like this for guidance. Horn's guidelines promote gimmicky, self-serving, impatient, one-dimensional scenework. Audiences are better served by troupes who look to Spolin's ""Improvisation for the Theatre,"" Johnstone's ""Impro,"" Close & Halpern's ""Truth In Comedy,"" and Napier's ""Improvise!"" for inspiration. The actors on ""Whose Line?"" only make it look easy-they've worked hard to get there. ""Comedy Improvisation"" is for troupes who's highest goal is to play for friends in a bar--not those who take making people laugh seriously."
2,Frustrating book,The first half of this text seems be be a bit simple. Many of the problems are confusing at best. The authors are not very clear on what they want. Many students in my class were frustrated by this time and time again. Still other times the questions were way to easy and never really chalanged the students. Basicly the first half does not provied a good solid base for Calculus. The second half is just flat out poorly written. It leaves the students constently scraching their heads wondering what the authors want. Questions are asked in such a way as to not make sence or not to follow the chapters very well. Chapt 7 is very much like this. Bad. The faculty agrees by having to put out an additional book of their own to help provide a better understanding of Trig.Over all this book needs to be re-thought out. A poor choise for instructors wanting their students to get a solid base so as to takle more advaced math classes.
3,Hard to read,"This is probably one of the most difficult books I have read. I'm 2/3 of the way through it, and am now into the story line, but the writer's style makes it difficult to understand and follow. You are left to figure it out on your own eventually as to what he is talking about. Be prepared for a mentally challenging read-- I actually put it down- read another book, picked it back up, put it down read another, and am finally finishing it."
3,An interesting and innovative story and style,"I thought Glen Cook's ""The Dragon Never Sleeps"" an interesting, imaginative story that presents Cook's creative energectic style. I read the entire book but did not enjoy it as much I have enjoyed other books as the focus is on the plot and circumstances not as much on characters and their development.mark"
1,Not a Garret PI series #3,I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories. I really disliked The Dragon Never Sleeps because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints. It's almost like he's trying to write an episode of the world he portrays as opposed to one person's adventure. It does add a lot of pages to the book if he is being paid by page.
5,Roxette looks back for the first time!,"This CD-SINGLE is the 4th single from the ""Have A Nice Day"" 1999 album. ""Salvation"" is a great ballad with cool tune and it sounds like old Roxette's ballad-hits like ""Fading Like A Flower (Every Time You Leave)"", ""Spending My Time"" or ""Cry"". The CD-SINGLE contains the album version of ""Salvation"" + the Crash! Boom! Bang! sessions track ""Crazy About You"" and ""See Me"". Also contains CD-ROM Component as Enhanced CD with the video track ""Stars"". This SINGLE is very cool! and is the last single from ""Have A Nice Day"" album."
4,Secrets of the Brit and Famous,"Fascinating, fact-rich account of the details of who owns,earns and spends what in Britain. Hobson canters through all the old Monty Python establishment: the Church, Royalty, the Courts and the Army, as well as the newly privatised institutions and the modern Plc. He seems to have a patrician soft spot for the posh and the old-school, such as the public schools, but he's nicely crunchy on the many indirect ways that the public's money is spent, and brutal on the expense of scams like the heritage industry. He has a journalist's cynicism about the general public which can get a little wearing, but the accessible writing and the facts make this a really fun map of the wealth of the nation."
1,worst piece of crap ive ever read,"This is honestly the worst piece of crap i've ever read. The grammar looks like it was written by a 3rd grader, and each chapter makes me want to relieve myself of puke. Don't waste your money on this, I know I did; i wish i could get a refund. Canul should just give up on his writing career. Even my dog doesn't want to chew this piece of crap up.Pros:-Nice quality font-Decent cover material-Burns very well in my fireplaceCons:-Expensive firewood-Worst thing ever I've ever read in my life"
4,some of their surreal best,"This album by the extremely English dada jazz-rock outfit contains some of their shiniest gems. This cover of the ""Monster Mash"" is probably the one that most people know, in which Igor is asked if he's watered the brains, and Viv laughs wonderfully demonically in the fade-out. The last two tracks are in a class of their own. Particularly if you can get anyone to air-guitar the solo on ""Canyons""... (Thanks, Roj!)."
2,Some mags will not work!,Works well if you like griping the mag tight as heck so it doesn't slip out. At lest that is what i have to do with my ruger mags... Once this breaks i will not be buying another.
2,HURTS,MAN I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE PERFECT SPEED LOADER UNTIL I GOT TO THE LAST TWO SHELLS.MY THUMBS STILL HURT. HONESTLY YOU WILL STRUGGLE WITH THE LAST FEW.
5,Indispensable work,"""Disputing the Subject of Sex"" is a polished but frank consideration of the intersection of educational practices and recent political theory. This book should be required reading for anyone interested in how subjects are formed in and transform communities and ideas of sexual difference. Cris Mayo is the smartest theorist of sexuality and education working today."
3,"Not great, but good enough...","Not great when it comes to flavor. But good enough, I guess, for it does the job it is supposed to do..."
5,Great product,"Love this stuff. Goes on smooth and not too thick. I live in a dry, high altitude location. Keeps my lips smooth."
5,Natural ice Chapstick,This is the only Chapstick that I will use I have been using it for years. They quit saleing it here where I live so had to get it online. That's how much I like this product
5,Actually heals and eliminates chapped lips!!,"I have tried SoftLips, Blistex medicated chapstick, and Natural Ice. The cheapest of the bunch (Natural Ice) was also the best at fixing my chapped lips and leaving them feeling smooth and silky. Softlips did nothing for my lips, Blistex medicated burned my lips but didnt help them. The regular chapstick brand left me reapplying every half an hour or so, and the medicated version didnt have SPF 15.I love Natural Ice and it cost me less than $2 for two sticks. =)"
5,Best Lip Balm in Industry quick service,This lip balm actually works. Used to get it at Wally Mart but they quit caring it. My order was here quickly and in good shape.
5,Best chapstick EVER,"I've used this chapstick since growing up in Minnesota winters. It truly is the best way to keep your lips from getting chapped in the winter. I couldn't find any where i live in Illinois, so was thrilled to find it here on Amazon. I can't stand using anything else!"
3,its ok for the price,"I tried this from a local store and for the price, it is pretty decent. i like the way it makes your lips tingle and feel fresh. I have been on the quest for the perfect lip balm ever and this comes in a close second, first being the Neutrogena Moisture lip balm. I buy the Natural Ice for the kids due to the price difference. I find it on the waxy side, but that is because I am spoiled with the Neutrogena. THe negative I have found with Neutrogena is the price, it is about 2.99 a stick. I just dont want to spend that on the kids to lose. If you want the perfect lip balm for yourself I highly reccomend the Neutrogena."
5,As described,Quantity and quality were as if I had purchased them in the store. We can not get this item in our area anymore and we didn't want to change so this was perfect.
5,Awsome,We love natural ice and have for years. I can't seem to find it in the stores anymore so I order it on line. Love to use it when it's cold outside and the wind chaps my lips. Great product!
5,The best chapstick!,"Mentholatum natural ice is my favorite chapstick, soothing and with sunscreen too. It really helps my sensitive lips."
1,"Not like it used to be, rashes",I used to use this all the time. But it was the old formula. Just bought this new one and it is horrible. It caused redness around my lips like they were chapped and the area was swollen. I'm completely disappointed. I will return it.
3,"Protects, Didn't Moisturize","In an urgent need to fix badly cracked/chapped lips I turned to Amazon to find a lip balm.I first tried outBurt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube, .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)only to end up with no improvement after 3 or so days. Although this might not be a fair amount of time I was in agony over my lips and needed a quick fix. I was in need of moisturizing my lips and repairing them, not just protecting them from further damage.I turned to Mentholatum Natural Ice hoping this would be an improvement over Burt's (for me, not that either product is bad) only to find out they were pretty much the same. There was no noticeable difference and my lips weren't improving after another 3 days.I would recommend this product for proactive lip protection, but I would look elsewhere for a moisturizing lip balm when being reactive to cracked/chapped lips."
3,tastes like chew,"Good price, but lacking in the length of the coverage time. It also reminds me everytime of the tobacco chew smell that stunk!"
5,The only stuff I use.,"I can't find it in the stores anymore, so I'm left to buy these in bulk on-line. Wouldn't use anything else"
5,Best lip balm ever,I have been using lip balm for over 30 years. Natural Ice is the best brand I have ever found. It lasts long and feels great.
5,Best Lip Protection,My husband and daughter will not use anything else. It is almost always sold out when you find it in stores.
5,Lip Balm,Love this product and can't find it anywhere but on Amazon. Great price. Order came quickly.
3,"Good Chapstick, Makes some peoples lips peel","I bought roughly 20 of these by mistake and gave them to all of my coworkers. Everyone loved them at first. Then roughly 20% of the users complained that the medicated balm made their lips peel. Others complained that it was not actually a Natural Ice Beer flavored lip balm. Still, for me, it works. 20% of my coworkers find it not so good, but then again they got free lip balm. I'm adding another star because nobody should complain about free lip balm."
5,Best lipbalm,"It's unfortunately become impossible for me to find this product at any local stores so I'm excited to be able to get it online. This lipbalm is the best I've tried, I highly recommend it."
2,Weird Application,"I read the reviews for this product and was so excited to try this. I usually use Chapstick brand chapstick, or Burts Bees - but I wanted to give this a try. I'm not a fan. When you apply it, it's very hard and doesn't glide on at all. You have to push really hard to get any on your lips and even then - it's got a terrible taste and the smell isn't my favorite. I would overlook those two and probably still use it sometimes if it wasn't so hard to apply. Like using an eraser on my lips. Maybe I just got a bad batch, I'm not sure. It seems like a lot of people love it, so give it a try if you're interested - it's not too pricey - but it wasn't for me."
3,Across The Great Book,This is a very good book. I feel that Kata's perspective is a very direct one. I could connect to her. When my Social Studies told us we had to read it I really thought it was going to be boring. I was wrong. I recommend this book to all people of all ages because I feel that there is a character that every one could relate to.
2,a story to believe,"This book is a little unbelieve 'cause i had heard some stories about crossing the board but never one like this one. This book can give an opinion to believe or not on it. Read it, it may give you a different prespective of this story like the one you passed (if you crossed the great river).edgar23"
4,across the great river,"AuthorIrene Beltran HernandezPlace of publicationHOUSTON, TEXASPublisherPiñata booksCopyright date1989Retail Price$9.95Summary of the bookAcross the great river, this story of a young Mexican girl who takes place on leadership role after her family accidentally becomes separate while illegally crossing the border into the United State.

2,where's the bergamot flavor?,"I love earl gray for it's deep color and strong lingering taste. This is SOOOO mild compared to other earl grays I have tried. All the Numi teas that I have tasted are rather weak, but since usually ""aged"" means deeper flavors, I thought I would give it a try. All I could taste was a trace of Assam (and I used a small cup for the tasting). If you are looking for a deep bergamot experience, this one is NOT for you."
2,Rishi Organic Earl Grey Loose Tea is MUCH better,"This is fine tea in quality, but quite dull in the ""Earl Grey"" (i.e. Bergamot) flavor department. The Rishi Organic Earl Grey Loose Tea is MUCH better all the way around... Way more aromatic to start with-- and of course, loose leaf tea is almost always going to brew better-- if done right. I wish I could return this tea, but alas, not possible. Suppose it will be handy for use when traveling as its still better than the stuff they try to pass off at airports and such."
1,Silver watch,"I was not happy with this transaction. The watch looked nothing likethe picture when I purchased it. The picture was a matte, dull stainlesssteel. When it arrived it was shiny, brite and did not look like stainless steel at all. I returned it and asked for a refund. I havenot seen the refund as yet. Please let me know when I can expect it.Thank you.------- Linda"
5,Excellent book for the beginner.,I went through Pimsleur I and II. Then bought several books to learn the grammar. This book explained many things more clearly than other texts.
4,good brush-up,"I think I am among a majority, who took several semesters of high school Spanish & forgot (or thought I forgot) everything. Weeks before leaving for a Spanish speaking country I picked up this cheap book, & found it to be the perfect tool to brush up. Works for me. But if you are completely brain-dead or rely on holding someone's hand to tie your shoes... buy Rosetta Stone :)"
5,ONE OF THE FINEST,"I AM SO HAPPY WITH TEACH YOURSELF SPANISH IN 24 HOURS, THAT I ORDERED THE TEACH YOURSELF FRENCH IN 24 HOURS.THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BEST SPANISH GRAMMAR BOOKS I HAVE STUDIED. IT IS LOGICAL AND SEQUENTIAL AS ANOTHER POSTER HAS MENTIONED.IT ALSO HAS AN ANSWER KEY IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK FOR THE SHORT 5 TO 10 QUESTION QUIZES POSTED THROUGHOUT.THIS IS JUST A REALLY GREAT BOOK AND WORTH ITS SMALL PRICE.THE BOOK KEPT MY INTEREST AND I FELT LIKE IT BUILT A STRONG GRAMMAR AND VOCABULARY STRUCTURE.I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TEACH YOURSELF GERMAN IN 24 HOURS SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE."
5,Great book. Fast shipping.,Great book with lots of detail. Was recommended by a friend of mine who teaches Spanish as the easiest book to learn from while at home. Superfast shipping.
5,Great family game,Our family has really enjoyed this game. It provides the right blend of skill and luck for everyone. Playing the game is great fun even if you lose at the end.
2,Very Disappointing Entry,"I've been a huge fan of the ULTRA series, but this one really disappointed me. I'm no self-proclaimed DJ expert, but these mixes strike me as very generic. With the actualdance"" songs there's a lot of energy, but no decent melodies or hooks. And the club remixes of the pop songs they chose? HORRIBLE. Not to mention dated! These collections are usually fairly commercial, but at least ""up to date."" So why, oh why, is there a remix of Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" - a big hit of 2003/2004??The second disc is slightly better, even though it does contain ""Washing Machine"" - one of the most annoying songs I've ever heard.Ultra 06 was a great installment, packed with several big, then-current tracks that had some deep, catchy hooks. This is two hours of BLAH. Skip it."
2,Booooring,"I have all the Ultra Dance albums, and this is such a dissapointment. Like most other rewiews here, many of the tracks chosen to be remixed were just .....old and stale. If I were at a club or a party and this album was in the system, I wouldn't be that interested in dancing. Most of the songs have INCREDIBLY long lead-in that are just not interesting. And most of the songs beats are just too repetitive.The bright side of things is the 3rd bonus CD included with mine. There are 3 (out of 6)great tracks on there. At least my money wasn't totally wasted."
2,"2-3 good songs per disc, most mixes are LAME","Imagine having some of your favorite songs that have been remixed, now imagine the best remix on the album. You won't find it on these albums. For example, the remix of ""Dare"" and ""Precious"" are both tepid at best. It's almost as if the producer just picked the lamest remix of each song and put it on these albums."
3,It's ok...,"First of all, Mr. Pac Dan has got to be out his mind. Apparently he doesn't go to clubs because Jacques LuCont's ""Mr. Brightside"" Remix killed dance floors all last year ESPECIALLY in Miami. Good tracks on this disc but you won't find anything groundbreaking. You may want to investigate Ministry of Sound's annual or Sander Kleinenberg/Lee Burridge ""Everybody On Tour"" if you're looking to experiment. This disc isn't bad but it's nothing you can't hear in Abercrombie."
4,critic,"I had the CD for a little while now. I heard the entire CD. I really like the music but it seemed it would not be the same type that could be played on the radio. Of course one day, they circulated some of the songs in there mix. You know when you buy a CD and listen to it you'll like it but don't think much of it. Now you hear it on the Radio and it all changes. You take that CD and look for that same song you heard on the radio. I would change the rating to a 4 to a 4++ or a 5 now..."
3,Question???,"I haven't bought the album yet mainly because compilations have club or remix edits. For those who bought the CD already, is the Deborah Cox ""House Is Not a Home"" the full mix or just the edit? Thanks... Contact me at TonyNguyen52174@sbcglobal.net."
2,I wish there was a better description before I bought this,"By the description I thought I would get plans for built-in furniture. I was especially interested in kitchen nooks. There was only 1 picture of a kitchen nook. There was some anecdotal suggestions for how to build, but no plans. I was disappointed. The pictures are pretty though."
3,When ?,"I'd say this was recorded in 1964, when Martin and his orchestra did a version of ""This Boy"" for ""A hard day's night"" (the movie), as all of the (original Beatles) tracks, on this CD, were recorded no later than 1963.Ha, just looked it up as I was writing this, orginal album WAS a 1964 release !"
2,It will make you laugh,"In the early 70s I baby-sat a ""beautiful music"" station at night. This is the kind of music that we spewed out: Innocuous, vapid drivel. This recording is heavy on strings, lots and lots of strings, a brassy horn, lots of tom fills and a few guitars thrown in - all doing the Arthur Fiedler shuffle. I can't figure out when this was recorded - the copyright says 1994 but the recording style sounds like late sixties. I gave it two stars because musicians are first rate and it is Lennon-McCartney compositions.The whole thing makes one yearn for a shopping cart and a stroll down the frozen food aisle or.... maybe an elevator ride."
3,Too Bulky and Heavy for Traveling,"This converter does the job well. Since it's a single outlet, I chose to attach a multiple-outlet extension cord, to accommodate all of my electrical needs, including a netbook. I didn't have any issues with it blowing fuses. The main reason I bought this was I've lost too many appliances to using just an electrical adapter while traveling overseas and on cruise ships, but when I bought this, I neglected to take into account the weight limits for baggage that is allowed on overseas flights. It added 7 lbs to my luggage and took up too much precious cargo space. I'm now looking for a lighter and leaner one. Anyone interested in buying mine knowing all the limitations?"
3,Missleading picture,"I bought this item because it had a Brittish plug in the photo. The product arrived with a European plug which meant I had to buy a second adaptor to make it work. The product itself is good and works well, I was just cross with the missleading picture."
1,A total failure,"I got this converter just today from amazon and its probably the worst product that i have ever got. The moment i switched it on, i realized the fuse had to be replaced. When i replaced the fuse and plugged it with a 240 volt cooker, there were fumes all over the room. I would not recommend this unauthentic product. It was mere waste of 35 USD."
5,Two thumbs up!,This book is being used in my college Chinese Civilization class and is known to be the best book for the course as for contents and illustrations. Couldn't stop reading.
2,"Good for ""light"" Chinese history","Do not expect a deep understanding of the history of China if you purchase this book. You will get the basic facts but that is about it. If that is what you are looking for then go for it, but if you want more look for a book with several hundred more pages."
1,"Unnecessarily emphasizes ""non-Chinese"" vs. ""Chinese""","First of all, this so-called illustrated history of China is mostly text and quite dry at that. A lot of history-telling is also quite confusing. The pictures are also mostly not very interesting to look at.What really makes this book terrible is the British author overly emphasizes the struggles between ""non-Chinese"" groups vs. Han Chinese. One thing we know about Chinese history is, unlike that of Japan and to some extent Korea, China proper was occupied by different ""ethnic"" groups throughout history, while expanding at the same time. The Han Chinese ethnicity itself has evolved greatly, much like the American identity has changed dramatically over the last 200 years (from WASP to ""melting pot""). The author here seems to revel in telling the reader how Han Chinese were constantly beaten up by ""foreign"" peoples. An objective reader can't help but question her motivation in writing this book."
2,Bored to tears,"I faithfully read this book as a text for a class. The fact that it was boring wasn't such a problem because reading the book was unpleasant. In fact, it wasn't such a bad read, for a textbook. However, I was bored enough that I retained next to nothing from each chapter.I personally find Chinese history fascinating (I speak the language, studied in Beijing, and majored in Chinese studies) but this book was a snoozer. For what you are going to get out of this book, take my short synopsis instead and forget the rest:Qin Dynasty 220 BC: Unified China, MachiavellianHan Dynasty 200 BC - 200 AD: ConfucianTang Dynasty 600-900: CosmopolitanSong Dynasty Around 1000 AD: Confucian revivalYuan Dynasty Around 1200: MongolsMing Dynasty 1300-1600: VERY ChineseQing Dynasty 1600-1900: Manchus"
2,Scattered.,"I like history, and I normally enjoy reading history books. I had to use this as a textbook for my class on China. My huge complaint about the book is the terrible flow of it. The thoughts just seem too scattered, and it gets frustrating, especially when studying. It will talk briefly about, say, Confucianism and filial piety on one page, where it relates to what the passage is talking about.. and then 30 pages later it will mention it again for no reason. It's like the author suddenly remembers random details but is too lazy to go back and edit the information.It is informative, but often feels sporadic."
5,Reference Book,"For anyone interested in China: This is a good, solid study and reference book. It is one of many that teach a deeper sense of the country and culture."
5,Works as Advertised!!,"eDead works great contrary to what many people say, if used correctly it will do exactly what it's supposed to do. It sticks to the metal of the vehicle perfectly and dampens sound very well. You do have to use several layers for the best effect, but it's still cheaper than a lot of the other dampening products out there. I personally used 3 layers in my trunk and still have some leftover and my trunk is huge. I took the advice of another reviewer and cut it down versus using large sheets. Just make sure you overlap to seal all openings. Product works great though."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!,"i used one only for my computer. lightning strike a few blocks down, fried my computer completely, and the company laughs in my face. they wont give me a penny of compensation. even though they have a so called $20,000 warranty. the whole company is garbage and they were bought out. the one time a surge protector was needed it didnt do anything."
3,"Not bad, but not what I expected","I expected a book that would introduce me to the nuances and ""how-to"" of pastoral care. However, this book is more about the socio-historical context in which modern pastoral care emerged.Like some others have mentioned, it is full of jargon, and, in my opinion, seems to be written as a magnum opus of the author. As such, it is very dense and seems to be an exercise in flexing the intellectual muscles of its author.Don't get this book if you are looking to understand how to do pastoral care (I would recommed ""Strategic Pastoral Counseling"" for that).DO get this book if you are looking for how the role and means of pastoral care have evolved over time."
3,My thoughts on this book,"I thought that this book had mostly all the stuff you needed to know in the way of repairing your Chevy Lumina or your Monte Carlo, but it did leave some things out, that I could have used to make my Lumina perform even better"
5,Cute Bunny,"I just received this figure and couldn't be more satisfied. I've never purchased this sort of figure before and wasn't sure what to expect. This is a very attractive figure measuring 8'' from her toes to the top of her head (less the ears). Aside from one foot not fitting properly into its peg on the base (which is not overly important), the figure is nicely detailed and beautifully painted and is well worth the purchase price."
2,chatty but sloppy,"Some of the advice in this book is great, especially on suggestions for enjoying meals socially without feeling like a freak. However, based on the title and the author's condition, it's easy to assume that the only foods recommended in the book are gluten-free, and that's not true. Several of the recipes and purchased-food recommendations are wheat-free, but not gluten-free, and are NOT clearly identified as such. I found the tone to be rather snobbishly superior, as well- perhaps a nice book for those in the caviar-eating set, but not written for the unprivileged who can not expect to be waited on hand and foot or to be able to afford all the specialty foods the author considers necessities."
5,The Celiac's Bible,"Along with the words, you have Celiac-Sprue Disease, your GI doctor should hand you this book and tell you to go home and read it. A diagnosis of Celiac seems overwhelming and the diet restrictive. The author uses humor and common sense along with personal experience to ease the pain and educate the consumer reading the book. Although a Gluten-Free diet is unlike any other, you can get a good, basic feel for it using this book. It helps to get one over the hump and on the road to wellness. I highly recommend this book. If you have Celiac Disease do yourself a favor and get it, if you have a friend or loved one with the disease show them that you care."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"The learning curve when you find out you and/or your family is gluten sensitive is steep. I wasted valuable time trying to eek information from this chatty waste of paper. The tiny amount of information buried under the self-important personal dribble is out of date. Gluten-Free Diet: A Comprehensive Resource Guide, by Shelley Case, a dietitian, is a much better use of time."
3,"Some good,some bad!","Kids LOVED Good night Gorilla and Pete's a Pizza, and Where the Wild Things Are, but the videos after the Wild Things are sorta dated and creepy things from the 70's. Wish they would have just put all the good ones on one video!"
5,Great Video Collection,"If you love the book, you'll love this video. We actually found books because of these videos. Pete's a Pizza is so cute. I even play with my boys like they are pizza dough now. The video collection is worth buying. Too bad they don't let you buy everyone they every made in one big bulk buy."
4,Mockery Meets Mystery,"In a nutshell: Shy Kitty Harrison's miserly father dies, revealing her to be an heiress. Lord Peter Chesworth needs money to restore his beloved estate and asks for Kitty's hand, professing a love he didn't feel. He believes her to be as pushing as her mother and treats her quite callously after the vows are said. Kitty retreats further into herself, shocked and dismayed by the unlovely turn her life has taken. Then, someone decides she's better off dead.My Opinion: Typical Marion Chesney, witty and darkly amusing at times, with tidbits of history and mockery of the upper class eccentricities. I didn't find it all that romantic; Peter was a cad at first and it was hard to believe he would fall in love with Kitty. The attempts on Kitty's life were more interesting than anything, really. It took me a little longer than usual to solve the mystery.Overall, 4 stars for wit, historical fact-dropping, and because I like Marion Chesney's often mocking look at the upper classes."
4,Cute and endearing,"But the typeface is too faint. It is nice to use that typeface because it is obviously taken from the original book, but it does not complement the very nicely reproduced photos that accompany each story.Other than that- it is a very sweet book."
5,Love it,"Natural Ice is great! Cherry Natural Ice is doubly great! I've never noticed the unpleasant medicinal/petroleum jelly-type smell that I notice on many other brands. I purchased this for my wife (then girlfriend), and she swears by it as well. The mentholatum is a bit tingly, and it keeps lips soft. A highly recommended product!"
5,The Best,I was so upset when local retailers stopped selling this in stores. This is BY FAR the best chapstick I've ever used!! Love the fact that its clear so it doesnt leave your lips a tint of red/pink like most common cherry chapsticks. I would recommend this to everyone.
5,Natural Ice lip balm review,This lip balm keeps my lips from cracking. I am an out door hiker and biker.Recommend this product highly.
5,Cherry Ice lip balm,"My wife is an addict of chap stick. Natural Ice Cherry flavor is her favorite. She won't use any other kind. For some unknown reason this product was taken off the shelves of all stores where we had previously purchased this item. I checked every drug store or grocery store within a 20 mile radius of our home. The only place I could find this chap stick was a hospital pharmacy, and that was the regular kind not the cherry flavor. That was acceptable to my wife, but not the same. We were planing to go to Mexico for our honeymoon so I suprised her with a box of arround 90 chap sticks. Needless to say she was elated."
4,I liked this product very much. It cleared ...,"I liked this product very much. It cleared up my very chapped lips in less than 2 days. The flavor is an interesting combination -- cherry-menthol, which is a surprise at first, but nice once you get used to it. The SPF is a nice healthy benefit as well. This product goes on smooth, and I believe could be worn under lipstick fairly well. It's long lasting and doesn't need re-application as often as some other brands. I would recommend this product."
4,Cherry Natural ice,"I've had trouble finding Cherry Natural ice in retail stores, so now I have stocked up."
4,This lip balm is not really that much ...,"This lip balm is not really that much different from other lip balms. It does go on very nice and it moisturizes well, but the moisture doesn't last any longer than any other balm. It does feel a little better than regular chapstick when you put it on, and it goes on very smoothly. I would buy it again."
3,"I have chronically chapped lips, so I've tried ...","I have chronically chapped lips, so I've tried a lot of lip balms over the past ten or so years. This Natural Ice product ranked about in the middle of everything I've used. It was a little too sticky for my taste, almost like glue, though it's not as waxy as some of the Chapstick varieties. I also don't know why it's called """"ice"""". I didn't get any sensation of coolness. However, the scent is pleasant and it does stay on your lips a long time. I'd recommend this product to people living in very cold or dry climates, but I probably won't be using it again."
5,Excellent,"An excellent chapstick, after using Natural Ice I could never go back to using any other generic chapstick."
3,Perfer the mint flavor better,"I really like the cherry flavor, but to me, it is not as moisturize as the original one. After I'm done with this box, I'm going back to the minty flavor."
5,Hard to find product,Was very happy to find this chapstick on Amazon. I am unable to find it in stores any more. I love both the cherry and menthol.
4,addicted to this stuff,"Natural Ice Chapstick is THE BEST! Since it's hard to find in drugstores, I have to get it online. The only suggestion I have is that they should make this size box, but without putting them all in individual packaging- it's wasteful. For the huge size they have no packaging, so it's obviously not necessary."
3,Padfolio Has Chemical Odor,"I was really looking forward to receiving this padfolio because I needed something that size, zippable, to take notes at meetings and conferences. I was also very pleased to find one in my favorite color blue. However, from receipt to this day it has a very strong disagreeable odor that I thought would dissipate. Some say it's just a leather odor and others say it may be the dye. In any case, you can still smell it across the room. I am sensitive to chemical odors and have no idea what to do with it to make the odor go away. I also would have preferred the inner pockets to zip like the one without the outer zipper. After examining and using it, I think the price of $70 is too high. Half that would have been more appropriate."
3,Simple 2-Track Single..,"and nothing more than that. If you like her song Over It, then get this single. But if not, then don't bother. The album only contains the album version and a 10 second call-out hook. I only reccomend this for big Katharine buffs."
5,Pure Bob Florence,This is a gorgeous collection of Bob Florence playing solo piano. What a treasure he was. The depth and beauty of his unmistakable style are here displayed in all of its subtlety and excitement. Don't miss it.
3,Beautiful but bland,"When I first put this CD on I thought, 'Man, this is great.' Fifteen minutes later I was saying, 'Yep, this sure is mellow.' By the end I was barely listening. It was like Bill Evans on thorazine . Now I don't even know where the CD is. Maybe it's what's propping up the wobbly leg of my coffee table. I'm not going to go look and find out. Florence is a fine fine piano player with a lovely touch, but there is no variation here. Maybe this CD would be good as one disk on a 6-disk player set to RANDOM PLAY, but played straight through it could put a weak person into a coma. So depending on how you listen to your music, or whether you listen to it at all (maybe you just like aural wallpaper, maybe you just want something to add class to your overpriced restaurant) this either is or isn't for you. As for me, I live in hope that Florence will do something more worthy of his talent."
1,Motor Burned Out,"I used this blender for the first time and the motor first gave out a burnt smell, then it wouldn't spin at all."
4,Great blender for a few years,"It performed beautifully for three years, given I didn't use it often for the first year and a half. It was only recently when I was using it almost every day that the plastic base of the glass cracked and it's no longer usable. But for the price, I really enjoyed it."
1,Piece of junk,"I purchased this on sale and kept it as a backup for my old Oster which refused to die after 12 years, which eventually it did few months ago. Out came this one and while we could barely use it 8-10 times, it overheated. I tried to open the blade assembly and it was so badly stuck that we had to keep on trying for 3 days on and off. Now the plastic gears barely touch and it leaks profusely. This is a piece of junk and is not worth your time. Any positive comments about this product are pre-mature or incorrect."
4,Colorful & Stylish,"This 3-pack is a very good value. You can change your IPod to match your outfit or match whatever your mood is. These cases do not have an attachable handle/strap so if you are looking for that this is not it. BUT these are still a very good value, I love them! They give great protection!"
1,Worthless,"This mirror advertises itself as 'crash tested', but what it really needs is usability testing. It's as if the people who designed it never actually tried it out in a car to see if it worked correctly. When attached to a headrest you can't see the baby down below in a carseat - the angle is all wrong. The only way to get a working angle is to attach it loosely, and then it immediately slips into a different position when you start driving."
1,Not useful if you don't have a headrest to attach it to,"The only place I can safely sit my son in my car is in the center of the backseat; unfortunately, there is no headrest there. I bought this mirror because it was the only one in the store that offered ""multiple attachments."" Well, the illustrated instructions were not helpful at all so I had to get creative and rig it up somehow. It is now poorly attached (a potential safety hazard) to the backseat and it will not stay at the angle that I need it to be in order to see my son."
1,Pretty much useless,"I could not get this mirror to angle properly in our Honda CR-V to give a view of the baby, and when my wife held the mirror on the seat as a test, the image of the baby was so small that I could discern no details about what the baby was doing. The mirror is also distorting. The image only appears focused and in the appropriate dimensions if you look DIRECTLY into the center of the mirror."
1,straps disintegrate,"I got this as a gift. I was constantly having to readjust it since it seemed to shift positions often. The worst was after a couple of months, the straps to attach the mirror to the headrest disintegrated, I guess due to exposure to sunlight from the car window. This seems like a major design flaw for a car seat mirror!"
2,Takes a bit of maneuvering for minivans-infant car seats,"I bought this so I could check to make sure my baby was ok since he can't hold his head up quite yet and so I could see my cute baby's face in the mirror while driving in our Honda Odyssey minivan. He's in an infant car seat though and I couldn't see anything at all either from my mirror or turning around to look into his mirror. I finally figured out I had to somehow raise the headrest and fit the mirror on the headrest. I'm still worried about it flying off but it does work now. Perhaps it would work on the window but I didn't bother. On the window, it would be held by suction and I really don't want that thing possibly flying off and hitting my baby."
3,sanity saver!,"this has been a sanity saver for me. i can clearly see what my daughter is doing without having to pull over and get into the backseat. i only wish it was easier to keep in place. for some reason, it will not stay in place in our regular car (slides down), but stays put perfectly fine in our SUV. other than that, i like this mirror."
1,BAH HUMBUG!,"If there was a Kingdom of BLAHDOM, Ginger Spice would undoubtably be the Queen and this book proves that without a doubt. I have seen so much Spice Girls merchandise on the shelves I am think I am having an allergic reaction to the group. This is one of the worst bits of Spice junk on the market. If you have to have a book about Ginger then go buy an official version, or at least one that has better photos, better narrative, better everything basically. My God-daughter who is a fan of the Spice Girls was so disappointed with this book I had to go change it for something else from the Spice Collection, much against my better judgement, I didn't want to buy it in the first place! Buy this at your peril, you'd be better flushing your money down the toilet, you'd get better value for it."
5,We miss u Geri,This book was really great!! It sounds like Geri is a very nice and up front person!! I would love to meet her. If you're reading this Geri...u always were the best!!
5,It has lots of great secrets!,"It tells lots of stuff about her. Also it shows lots of cool clothes that she wears. If you don't have it get it! After all she is the best spice girl of them all! Maybe I'll be her for Halloween.From, The biggest Ginger Spice fan in the world!"
2,Too Much & Too Little,"While ""Jack"" is a good game, and worth buying, this relatively pricey five-disk version is more than most folks will need, AND comes with CD's alone--no helpful guide or booklet that might tell you useful things like ""How to pause a game?"""
5,One of the best party games ever!,"the most fun I've had on the computer. The thing that gets to you is how its totally non-repetitive. The dialog is seamless unlike many sports games (""forsberg SHOOTS! he SCORES what a great WRIST SHOT"") Tons of useless information great for conversations. Dozens of play modes throughout each version will definitally keep you playing. Another fun aspect is the hidden stuff. New play modes, jokes and tricks pop up every so often(Question: you know what would be really good right about now? Answers: A. Hot Dog B. Taco C. Pizza D. Nachos). I can reccomend this for anyone who wont mind simulated insults and the occasional adult themed question. Its also a great value. Buying all the games seperately(if you can find them) would exceed this price by far. A nearly perfect compillation!"
4,buy it buy it,"these are the five best ydkj games. they were the first that i bought. i like 3, the ride, and offline better than 1 or 2 but theyre good to have anyway. i;ve sat in front of m computer for hours playing and laughing at the hilarious questions."
4,It was only Small Beginnings,"Having been sacked from Yes, ex-members Peter Banks and Tony Kaye got together and formed Flash. Banks, being the more inspirational of the two, made a heavy impact on the band. His guitar playing was symphonical, jazzy and rocking at the same time. Their debut had no explicit lyrics (as far as I can tell), but an explicit cover, and from what I hear, the original album (in good shape) is worth a lot of money. But don't get too excited on that. It's the music that counts. And, on this debut, there's enough to keep your mind from other things. After this album, they released two more ('In The Can' and 'Out Of Our Hands') before they vanished into thin air. This debut still stands out, from 'Small Beginnings' to a fine end."
2,Now i understand,"Listening to this album (which everyone says is their best)it is completely understandable why Banks was booted out of Yes. He can't write a decent tune if his life depended on it (sticking little parts one after the other does not qualify as GOOD music composition, specially if those parts don't have relation between them ). The guy can play his guitar. But can't seem to find his own voice on it (Why is he trying to sound like Howe ALL the time is beyond me). The album is plagued with Yes cliches. And the singer's voice will make you cringe. Another example of why 'Prog' gets such a bad rap."
4,Flash never got further than Small Beginnings,"The cover was tempting, the band was promising, but Flash never made the big time. Their debut is still their strongest outing, with ex-Yes members Peter Banks (guitar) and Tony Kaye (keyboards) trying desperately to prove that they were sacked for no good reason. When you are into 70's progressive rock, you should lend them your ear."
4,The first Flash album is a great prog rock relic.,"Flash was an excellent progressive rock band from the early 70's that featured original Yes guitarist, Peter Banks. If you're a fan of the first two Yes albums you'll like Flash. They put out a total of three lp's, but this is by far the best."
3,Not as Good as the Medicated Lip Stuffs!,This Vaseline lip stuff is ok but I get very dry lips that require a lip treatment that is medicated like with Blistex or any other brand of medicated lip stuff like that and this Vasaline stuff though okay for prevening dry chapped lips is NOT strong enough to heal my lips when they are already very dry!
3,"Not too bad, But...","The layout of this book is not standard to other quilt books- pattern and instructions together. It does have some good ideas and cute patterns; however, directions are given at the very beginning, then followed by the patterns leaving the reader to guess what category it falls under. ie: The paper-piecing patterns are shown 3 to a page (small); but the reader must return to the beginning to discover they must enlarge the piece to achieve a particular block size and how to construct it. I reviewed the book first from the library, and I am contemplating purchasing a used book if the price is right from Amazon. I would not recommend this for a beginning quilter."
2,Controller problems,I bought one of these years ago because I got a good price on it. But I have to say it has left me stranded many times. Setting it up to stop and start where it was suppost to was a pain. Then it would run for a month then stop. So I would need to reset and go thought the whole thing again. My neighbors told me to get a Gtopro 3000xl it was a little more but I love it. The set up was easy and it runs great. The liftmaster sit in the garage.
3,Smaller than expected,"I could not tell from the picture on the Amazon website, but the watch (nice as it is) turned out to be too small for my purposes. Since I need a large enough watch to see what time it is, without my glasses on, I realized I have to start looking for men's watches instead of women's watches."
2,Pink Indiglo watch,"I love the look of the watch and the comfort, also love the lighted dial being pink (as I recall someone else mentioning in a review) however it does not say lit. It did at first but now when I try to view it in the dark on a walk,etc..it just blinks so fast and not long enuf for me to even see the time in the dark and that's the main reason I look all over for a cute indiglo watch. So..as much as I like it, the main reason I bought it is a big disappointment:("
2,did not keep on ticking after a licking,"I bought this watch for my 10 year old daughter. Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks, it stopped working, much to both of our dismay. She is quite a tomboy, but I grew up with the timex ads that claimed ""takes a licking and keeps on ticking""...maybe they just don't anymore. In other words, nice watch, but not as tough as they used to be."
4,Good for what is available,I have the 3.0 model but everything it talks about seems to coincide. Would be nice to have a book thats updated in the future but it works well.
5,A Comprehensive Law Dictionary,"I bought BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY for two basic reasons.First, the Abridged Fifth Edition was very affordable.And I also wanted to compare it with the legal dictionary that I already have.The only negative that I can think of is the age of this edition.Despite that, I have been very happy this older edition.It's a comprehensive list of terms with over 16,000 definitions. That's considerably more than Oran's Dictionary of the Law has.I found the definitions to be thorough.The pronunciation guide is another feature that I appreciate in BLACK'S.An added bonus is the U.S. Constitution in the back of the dictionary.If you are searching for an affordable, comprehensive law dictionary this edition is worthy of consideration."
5,Simply Incredible,"This is the most diverse solo album yet for MacAlpine. He combines intricate melodies, shifting rythms, and his trademark flawless execution at all speeds to produce an album that equals any work he has done. The depth of his songs is amazing, from the adrenline rush of Christmas Island to the sinking stomach feeling of Isis. Shrapnel is billing this album as his return to neo-classical, which isn't accurate. This album is more, and you MUST listen to it."
2,"Sorry, Just Doesn't Do It for Me","Tony MacAlpine is a great technical player and I've been a fan since his ""Edge of Insanity"" album. Actually, I've been a fan since his ""Birds of Prey"" recording for a Guitar Player magazine issue. But after the superb ""Maximum Security"" album of 1987, I don't think he's been able to really develop a unique voice or style and expand beyond his intial fan base.There's nothing here to keep my interest. Even as an avid guitar player, I find his blistering speed runs and cleanly sweep-picked arpeggios just ho-hum now. The main melody lines are bland and instantly forgettable. Tony's playing is so polished that one just can't feel any emotion in his playing. I'm sure the core fans will buy anything Tony releases and rave about it, but I wouldn't recommend this album to any newcomers because there are a lot more interesting stuff out there than this effort."
1,More Bland Neo-Classical Muzak,"A friend recommended this to me saying that this so-called ""neo-classical"" album would be different. He knew how I hated this whole genre that's all about speed for speed's sake with boring melodies and generic arrangements. Well, this album defines all that's bad with this whole genre. Musicianship is, of course, what you'd expect: precise and polished. But it fails to connect on creativity, originality, or emotional substance. The speed licks are typical neo-classical fare: rapidly-picked minor scales and other modal variations and sweep-picked argeggios that just cry out: ""Hey, can YOU do this?!?"" My answer is: ""No, I can't and I don't want to."" It simply doesn't get much worse than this."
2,Typical Shred Fare,"Reading some of the good reviews, I really expected a lot from this album, but there is no new ground being broken here: forgettable melodies, the typical speed licks which are just so ho-hum now, competent but boring arrangements, etc. It's not as bad as some have stated here, but this whole neo-classical genre is a dead-end. I say: Stick with Satriani and Vai."
5,Smokes!,"This CD really smokes! These guys are playing some incredible stuff here. It is nice that they incorporated moments of Genesis-y style melodys spliced in with the intense attack of furious fusion. Brilliant and groundbreaking! This stuff is never old or boring, just timeless. Tony MacAlpine is on equal ground with Vai, Satriani, Morse, Petrucci, etc. This CD proves it. Also check out the CAB CDs, they are well worth the money. If you are a fan of Niacin and Dennis Chambers drumming, try theCAB stuff (also with MacAlpine on guitar)."
5,amazing guitar player,in order to listen to tony's music you have to respcet his playing his technique speed and feel whish played that good
4,"Very relaxing, chilled out drum'n'bass","Of the five Lemongrass albums I've checked out, this is the only pure drum'n'bass album I've heard from them and if it were up to me I'd say it would fall into the same dnb category as LTJ Bukem; although it's not as jazzy and the beats vary a bit more, and that's one of the things I really value. This album is good for a journey-taking listen, it's got calming instruments, good bass lines and pretty much stays chilled out and relaxing the whole time; it maintains a mood. I give it 4 stars because, for my tastes at least, it could stand to vary just a little bit more. If you like music of this genre I'd also recommend ""Big Bud - Infinity + Infinity,"" ""Gerd - This Touch Is Greater Than Moods,"" ""Alex Reece - So Far,"" and a really good downtempo yet still journey-taking album: ""Noon - Bleak Output"""
5,An Intelligent Review with Proper Capitalization,"This is a fine product the General of Electric has blessed us with. It allows the consumer to create their own numerical code using each number once. The only drawback to this is that the code itself doesn't need be in any particular order. So just don't go using all ten digits in your code, or else all a tricky thief need do is mash all the numbers down at once.Other than that, its a very solid device that would require a prybar and a hammer to remove without a code.I wish a good 'morrow to you sir or madame, and trust you've found this review helpful.nOt foR UsE wITh CAr KEys.DUH."
1,KEY COMPARTMENT TOO SMALL!!,"I GOT THIS FOR MY ""AUDI"". ANY NEW CAR KEY IS TOO FAT FOR THE COMPARTMENT. EVEN A SUBARU KEY, WITH REMOTE WILL NOT FIT!WORSE YET. THE THERE'S A PHILIPS SCREW INCLUDED, TOO HOLD THE KEY IN BOX. I'M LOCKED OUT, & I NEED A SCREWDRIVER TO GET MY KEY??WORTHLESS!"
2,Not quite what I expected,"The unit was much heavier than I expected, and the key space was very small. But what I really found surprising is that the ""combination"" is simply designating what buttons are to be pressed. Not which order they are pressed. So, it really isn't that secure. For example, if your ""combination"" is 1,2,3,4 then if you press 1,2,3,4 or 4,3,2,1 or 2,3,1,4, etc... the box will open. There is a mechanical (not digital) mechanism for resetting the combination. I'm going to keep the unit, as it is usefull for low security purposes, but it is not a high security device."
5,GE Security Key Box,"I love this item. We've had one for a couple of years, since seeing it recommended on ""It Takes a Thief,"" and I recently purchased one for our son. It's a great way to provide secure access to our house without giving out a lot of extra keys. We no longer have to ""hide"" a key for others to use or in case we forget or lose our house key. Only drawback is that the bolt that holds the key in place often comes loose."
5,"Keith Urban Awesome "" A Keith Urban Fan ""","Play this cd all the time. Great song writer,singer and guitar player. Any one who likes country should buy this cd. Keith is going places. Love all the songs on this cd. This is a must have cd. A Keith Urban Fan."
2,Being Kind,"Being kind with the two stars, but I hate extremes. As for the book...well, overwrought? My God, where have all the editors gone?"
4,Eat the Rich (of Turn of the Century New York),"M. H. Dunlop's Gilded City began slowly for me as I got used to her style but then nothing could stop me. This book is full of salacious gossip and horrifying scandal. The behavior of the rich would be laughable if it was not at the expense of the poor. If Ms. Dunlop does not exactly take a position, she does create one by her selection of material. She truly makes the disparity between rich and poor come alive in a way that is shocking and true. The sources are limited to newspaper accounts and this is not a truly historical survey of the decade but it does achieve what it sets out to do. It creates for the reader a glimpse of the social world at this time as seen by the readers of the newspaper and the members of society trying to get in the newspapers. A fun, frightening read."
3,"Some interesting stories, but hard to follow","I enjoyed some of this book, but I got the impression that the author had a lot to tell, but didn't know how to go about it. The anecdotes were mostly interesting, but disorganized, and the cruelty to animals section was awful. The only thing connecting all of the chapters was the time period. I didn't expect to find that scandal is so often boring."
5,No more sores,"I used to suffer greatly from mouth sores. Then I discovered a few tricks. First, get this toothpaste. Second, put your toothbrushes in the dishwasher. Finally, use an alcohol-free mouthwash. It works! No more sores!"
2,Traded off canker sores for sore gums,"I purchased this product for the same reason any one else would... I get canker sores from time to time. Maybe this toothpaste works great for the treatment of canker sores, but have not used it long enough to tell. What this toothpaste did for me is leave me with some very sore gums after only a couple uses. After some Google searching I found out there are others that had the same issue.""Rembrandt toothpaste is said to contain saccharin, a chemical which has been said to be toxic. There are some consumers which claim that using Rembrandt makes their gums more sensitive and painful while brushing teeth. These are not true to all those who use Rembrandt and definitely, our body reacts to substances uniquely.""I guess this product is great for the majority, but I have to review based on my personal experience."
5,Great stuff,We have used this product for over 10 years with great success. It seems almost impossible to get in big box or pharmacies.Hope you keep carrying it.
5,the reviews are true,"I had been getting constant cancer sores, usually 1 or 2 at a time but I always had them. My girlfriend told me to look for a prescription which turned out to be a waste of time. I stumbled on this toothpaste and after read the reviews i forked out money for a couple tubes. I was skeptical at first because i got another a day or so after i started using it. But its been about 3 weeks and havent had any since. Ive even had cuts in my mouth (which usually turn into sores) and they just went away.The toothpaste experience is rather dull and it feels like your not cleaning your teeth all that well. But it does make your breath better and ive noticed a slight whitening effect.It definitely changed my quality of life and improved my relationship with my girlfriend (she will kiss me now). I only wish it wasnt so expensive for such a tiny tube."
3,Dunno,"Cannot tell. I certainly get canker sores still. Fewer? Do not know ... but I hate them so much, I will try anything to hopefully reduce occurrence."
2,Too Strongly Flavored,"With burning mouth syndrome, I am highly sensitive to taste and most toothpastes are much too strong for me, including this one. I could not use it and do not recommend it, though it's not as strong as some toothpastes."
5,Perfect for anyone with braces!,So I'm sure everyone who's had or currently has braces knows of their discomforts. They'll rub against the inside of your lips and you'll sometimes be left with canker sores or painful wounds. Not only does this toothpaste prevent canker sores from developing but it also helps heal any you may already have. I no longer have to use wax to cover the brackets. This thing is amazing!
3,Good things and bad things,"This product is wonderful to help keep canker sores from happening. I used to have them all the time - almost constantly, but in using this toothpaste, I'm down to two or three a year.It hasn't done anything to whiten my teeth. I have never cared about that since just stopping the canker sores was my goal.Also, I'm fairly sure it doesn't do anything to fight plaque or tartar. Nothing in the description or the box says anything about that. You might want to talk to your dentist about that.The reason this works is because it doesn't have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I've looked in all kinds of stores from Walgreens to natural/organic specialty stores. There are some interesting brands out there that would make you think they would work, but read the ingredients. I only found one, and it tasted terrible!"
4,Expensive but worth it,"This toothpaste really seems to help with my canker sores. I don't get them as frequently and when I do, it isn't as painful or irritating to brush. It's pretty expensive compared to most other toothpaste, but if you get canker sores often, then I think it's worth it. The only other thing I don't like about it is that it gets watery almost as soon as you start brushing with it, so sometimes I have to spit and add more to my toothbrush halfway through brushing. Whatever ingredient they remove to make it less irritating must be a ""bonding"" ingredient that keeps regular toothpaste in a more paste-y form."
5,Quite effective at both whitening and reducing pain!,"This product is heaven sent for me. I have frequent outbreaks of canker sores that don't seem to follow any kind of cycle. Sometimes they will last for weeks at a time, making it difficult for me to work and socialize (I'm a therapist, so when I can't talk, it's a problem). My dentist had prescribed B12, which seemed to help a little, but not too much. I can tell the difference with this toothpaste as soon as it goes on my teeth: it doesn't burn my tongue! It doesn't have a bad taste, either, like other toothpastes for without lauryl sulfate that I've tried.I was skeptical about it's whitening properties, but after about a month or so I believe I am seeing a difference."
5,Tastes great and really helps,"With the absence of a harsh foaming agent the toothpaste dramatically cuts down on the frequency and severity of canker sores. It's a great toothpaste, definitely would suggest it to sufferers of canker sores or even non-sufferers!"
3,ok toothpaste,"I like the whole ""canker sore"" thing. I just wish it feel a bit more like the other toothpaste where it burn a bit in your mouth (I use that as a way to tell if it's really working or not)."
3,"Pricey, doesn't seem to work as well as the older one","I always switch to this toothpaste when I have cankersores. It used to be that when I switched to this stuff (first used it in ~2007), my cankersores would heal much more quickly and stop growing larger. This newer formulation doesn't seem to be as effective at preventing the cankersore growth. I'm not sure exactly why. I can't find that the ingredient list is very different from the stuff I used to be able to find at the local drugstores."
5,No more Canker Sores - Lifesaver,"Since I was a child I have suffered from Canker Sores on a regular basis. They stayed with me for days and really disrupted how I felt and what food I ate. I would buy the medicine to put on them to dull the pain, but the actual sore would not go away any quicker. This is like a wonder toothpaste. It does brush a little funny (because it is missing the chemical that causes toothpaste to foam up), but honestly I have not had a canker sore in almost 2 years. I use this in the morning and regular ""foaming"" toothpaste at night. If I feel a canker sore coming on, or I bite my lip, I switch to this full-time. AMAZING!"
5,Strong handles and a zipper!,This is what my daughter needed at Christmas...She was flying and only had an old bag without a zipper...I'm sending her 2 of them...Thanks to this designer. Bev
5,good value,All that I wanted. Not as stiff as a heavy grade Lands End canvas bag but with all the positive attributes. It is stiff enough and is washable.
2,Twice the size you would expect,"I ordered this bag thinking it would be about 14"" by 16"" or so. It came nearly twice that size. I really don't know what I can do with a bag this size as I hardly ever go out of NYC."
1,"Arrived dented, unable to use in grease gun","Perhaps I deserved this for buying such a minor item online, but both of the cartridges I received arrived dented due to poor packing, and thus won't fit in the grease gun. This is something you probably want to just buy at any corner automotive supply store."
3,I'd rather have Kondrashin,"I much prefer the old Melodiya LP with Kirill Kondrashin's Execution of Stepan Razin. Kondrashin takes the listener into the drama, while Jurowski leaves us as audience in a theatre. Nice music, but we are not part of the action."
1,dont buy this game,This game was so vulgar. Very inappropriate. I thought it was a trivia game but all they do is call you names and say bad words. Don't waste your money.
4,I Memorized Jack,"The Jack series, overall, is one of .the. best trivia games I've ever played (and I've played a number in my time). Sadly, The Ride, while being a F'ing blast, falls short on the replay factory. You play a number of floors, but after you're run through the game once (it's set up in a linear fashion), you have to start over from the beginning, and all the questions are the same--I'm still working over games one and two, and despite having some questions appear multiple times, there are still new questions to discover.There are extremely fun conventions in The Ride, only slightly taken down by the, usually fun, announcers' comments--they seem ""snotty"" in this version.Overall, still a good purchase, but after the slap and tickle, there's no cuddling. I'm gonna go back to YDKJ2 and explore some more."
5,This is a great cookbook!,"I have had this cookbook for years, and it's one of my favorites. Every recipe that I have tried has worked out well. Flavorful!! The recipes are easy to follow, and the ingredient lists are reasonable. You can easily double if you want to make more, but they are really geared to the two-serving dinner. Truly a gem of a cookbook. I keep coming back to this one!"
5,Can't wait for the next one.,This is a very fun game with a good group of people playing it. I only wish that I had more time to play it.
5,I =[LOST]= MY LIFE TO THIS GAME,THE SINGLE PLAY ON THIS GAME IS GREAT BUT...... PLAYING IT ONLINE IS WHATS ITS ALL ABOUT ITS LIKE A CHAT ROOM WHERE YOU OFF PEOPLE! BUY THIS GAME NOW... JUST LIMIT YOUR TIME ON IT.
5,SO worth the price for the laughs you get,"Who knew that Ben Burtt was so funny? But he is.Do not...I repeat, do not sneak a read of this book while at work or school. You will get caught when you laugh out loud. It is that funny.You not only get the phrases that you've probably seen in the previews, but you get ""cultural information"" that is priceless. And the illustrations by Sergio Aragones are destined to become classics.But wait! There's more! There's also a ""Behind the Sounds"" section that goes through how Ben Burtt created many of the sounds Star Wars fans hold dear. And there are also great translations of scenes from the Classic Trilogy that use alien languages.If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll really love this book. (Thank you DelRey for putting out some humor!) If you're not a fan, but trying to find something for someone who is, then get this book. They'll thank you for it."
5,an unsual concept that works very well,"""The Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide"" is an unusual concept and one that works surprisingly well. While a guide book, it is written of course for entertainment value and reads quickly. The book is packed with humorous drawings, expressions and cultural suggestions so that one never commits a faux pas, something which could get a traveler killed on the wrong system. One humorous extraction is that there is no word for ""please"" or ""thank you"" in Huttese. From the deep core to the outer rim, learn to count and speak basic phrases in Huttese, Bocce, Ewok, Wookiee, Jawa and even Gungan. While the Star Wars universe has no equivalent to a work like ""the Klingon Dictionary,"" this is not only the next best thing, it's more enjoyable. From young children to adults, all Star Wars fans will enjoy this linguistic adventure."
1,Does not fit,Does not fit the two gallon bucket. Will not create a sealed container with the bucket with the chicken nips.
4,A Must Have for a Flight Sim Enthusiast collection!,"I first purchased this game in 2001 when it came out and have fallen in love ever since. This game was developed with guidance from an actual fighter pilot so it is extremely detailed and accurate (considering restrictions for sensitive information). As a military member in the aviation community this game has, believe it or not, taught me alot about ordinance and flight instruments. The only reason overall I gave this a 4 star rating instead of 5 is that on newer machines with newer OS (I run Windows 7) the 800x600 ratio coupled with very basic coding proves navigating the menus to be a little tricky. Also the graphics are what to be expected from an older game. I hope you enjoy this as much as I have for nearly a decade."
5,no title,"Underbelly is an inspirational book that breaks the silence of secrets, portrays the struggle of healing, and the triumph of love. Most importantly, this book shows us how poetry serves as a vessel for personal transformation and victory over the challenges that life brings before us."
1,Simply boring!,"I'm a fan of turn-based strategy games, I love civilization (1,2,3), I also like rts games like rise of nations, but this one is simply boring... and complicated. It plays as slow as a turn-based, and doesn't even have half the depth! I couldn't play more than half an hour without wanting to run away screaming!Horrible!"
3,It's ok.,"My son and I played with this a couple times, it's ok but not overly stable in the ground. Ended up using the weighted rubber mats when outside since the stakes wouldn't stay in the ground all that well.If you are hosting a party or something and this is used in conjunction with a bunch of other games, it's pretty good but if you are hoping it keeps the attention on it's own you'll be sorely disappointed."
3,"GOOD FOR CHILDREN, DON'T BOTHER WITH THE RED STAKES","This review is made with an outdoor use in mind.The horseshoes are made of rubber and outdoor use fades their color. However they are more than durable enough to use and leave outdoors at all times. The red plastic hollow pegs were discarded and replaced with 3/8"" rebar.Indoor use of this product does not appeal to me."
4,great for kids,Bought this for a 7 year old horse themed birthday party and the kids had a great time without injury anybody.
1,Dangerous,It says materials are cancer causing! I'm not letting my family use it! I would not purchase again and do not recommend it.
2,Don't bother.,"I thought this set would be perfect as it has the rubber so you don't have to stick the stakes down into the ground. BUT also comes with the stakes if you need those. The rubber stinks like tires, and it does not go away after awhile. They can't be in the house because it smells up the whole house. BUT they don't work outside either, because the stakes are plastic and you can't pound them into theground without splitting the plastic."
5,"Super, best size! All others cannot compete w/ the proper size & height for all ages","Best size, simplicity for ALL ages & easy to put together & away! The horseshoes are perfect size & weight--we had all ages play & even little 4 year old kids to adults were having fun!"
5,These guys rock!,"this band is going to make it big. they are what todays heavy metal are missing. they pull their stuff right from the prime heavy metal days long past. this is heavy metal's big come back right here. check their cd out, no dissapointments here!"
5,Amazingly Uplifting,Jeff is such a wonderful person and entertainer. He's sincere in his testimonies and songs of hope and understanding. Would recommend for anyone.
4,cute gift,"I got this as a gift for someone, she liked it!For those who dont have tons of time to sit and transcribe every move your child makes."
5,really cool,"This book is a laid back baby book. This was my second baby and I don't have a lot of time on my hands. This was the type of book I could fill out whenever I had the time, plus its really cute."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered a few of these, thinking they'd be pefect for a first time busy Mom. I was pretty disappointed - not what I expected. Small book, nothing special about it."
5,A terrrific game,This game is an outstanding product. Even though it does eventually repeat the questions (but it was longer than one time unlike who wants to be a millionaire!)My husband and I play it online and just have a blast.Well worth the money. Would have gave it higher than 5 stars but couldn't.May not be suitable for young kids.
1,As Lame as YDKJ Gets!,"I am a YDKJ fan, I have been for years. I have to say that the Television and Movies games are lame. You would have to really be a YDKJ addict, as well as an addict of TV shows which are mostly from the 70s and 80s to enjoy this game. I was totally disappointed to see these games after playing the original and The Ride. If you want a fun trivia game, it is YDKJ, but spend your money on one that is worth it- The Ride is tops."
3,good game for older generations,"They must not have been able to get the rights to use a bunch of shows on this, because it is filled with a lot of 60's, 70's and very early 80's shows. I love the YDKJ games generally, but this one needs some updating. My in-laws are much better suited to play this one than my husband or I. We still had fun, but I would like to see a newer version with updated shows on it."
5,AMAZING!!!,"I have been a fan of Stone Temple Pilots and Filter for years. Army of Anyone combines the talents of these bands. With an impressive debute album, they gave the music industry what it has been lacking for years. If they keep it up, they could dominate the complete music scene."
3,"Good, but not THAT good.","When I first heard of this CD, I was in two minds about the project as such, since so many of these current ""super groups"" just do not hold it together for me or have that mesh that is right, but being a fan of both filter and Stone Temple Pilots, I felt it was worth giving a shot.I have to admit, it is a good effort by the Deleo brothers with song writing and production, but i just couldnt help but feel that either they tried TOO HARD for a sound that didnt sound natural for them, or that this is just a preset to a future better album.This album will grow on you, but if you are expecting anything like STP/Filter meshing well and not sticking out like a sore thumb then you probably will want to give this a miss.I'd like to see how they do in the future with this project but for now I have to say, its good but not THAT good."
5,Underrated for sure!,"Being a long time STP fan a was very skeptical about this ""supergroup"" but I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised! Patrick blended quite will with the DeLeo bros. In fact, I think it was a better pairing than Audioslave. Although, I did love their first few albums as well. I was upset to hear that Army of Anyone had split! I would've liked to hear a 2nd album and at least get to see them on tour. Oh well. Will STP and Soundgarden back together I guess the ""supergroups"" are I thing of the past now. This albums is definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of either band. BTW, I gave this album a 5 to offset those boneheads that gave it a one and couldn't state any intelligent reason why. Regardless, this album is a very solid 4 stars!"
3,Army of Anyone is alright,"It's not the greatest album, but it's not the worst. I haven't listened to it in a while, there might be a song I missed."
1,Far cry from Filter,"I really wanted to like this album, being a huge fan of Filter, but it's just not possible. Patrick's voice is barely audible on the first track, the appropriately titled ""Doesn't Seem to Matter,"" and it's all downhill from there. I will say in all fairness that I never liked STP, so I'm sure that's part of the problem. That and the fact that it sounds like they stuck Patrick in a closet while he was recording the vocals, that is. Don't waste your time and money on this album if you're a Filter fan and expecting anything remotely resembling the Amalgamut(which may have been unrealistic on my part but hey, I'm an optimist). Big disappointment."
5,Great album,"If you like either bands (STP or Filter) then you'll love this album. I am really impressed with the sound the guys came up with, unique but true to their roots. Hasn't left my cars 6-disc changer since I bought it, one of the rare recordings I like from beginning to end."
1,How Did They Mess Up Filter and STP?!,Go burn $10. It will be less painful. This was a huge disappointment with the parties involved.There isn't zero stars or it would have gotten that rating.
3,Hawkwind-'Stasis:The United Artists Years 1971-75'(One Way),"Another title pretty much for the completists.Total of fifteen cuts that draw from the first five(5)Hawkwind lp's that were reissued on CD for the very first time BY the One Way label.Which were Hawkwind-self-titled debut('70),'In Search Of Space'('71),'Doremi Fasol Latido'('72),'Space Ritual' 2-CD('73)and 'Hall Of The Mountain Grill'('74).This disc would be ideal for a late night DJ to just put on the air and fall asleep for awhile.In fact,I believe that sort of antic may've very well happened before."
3,"Sure takes off the makeup, but also the top layer of your skin!!!","This item takes off the makeup, thats a good thing - however everyday use of this is not recommended. As it took a top layer of my skin, I had red rashes all over from the irritation of the drying product. However - every other day use of it is okay."
3,Assassin's Creed: Altair's Chronicles,"Very good, better than i expected from a handheld game, obviously does not measure up to original, but much better than expected, good gameplay, interesting plot, if a bit sketchy, some glitches, but nothing major, very good game over-all"
3,Not bad,"Truly an amazing game from a production viewpoint. Not many games that were taken this seriously on the NDS. I'm sure it was meant for DS gamers wanting a more ""mature"" game. If curiosity of whether the DS version is superior to iPod version brought you here, it is a matter of taste. NDS version has rougher graphics, but a physical game pad. The iPod version has much smoother graphics and even voice acting(DS game doesn't), so it has higher production values. However, I preferred the DS game because (opinion) it plays better. Lengthy game for casuals, maybe short for gamers. Fun game, considering it's portable, overall."
1,Unenjoyable.,"I simply did not enjoy this game. I expected a portable version of the console game, and I was largely disappointed when I played a mediocre platformer.The controls are clunky, and while the graphics push the DS to their limits, the unrealistic death scenes, cheap deaths such as hitting the water, and overall clunky controls with the D-Pad are just lame. It felt like a platformer from the Nintendo 64 age. And while the mini-games are fun, the lower-half of the DS is sparingly used, and the graphical effects beyond the textured 3D are just unimpressive and unimaginative. The game lacks the stealth components and free-roaming game-play that made its console big-brother great.I was hugely disappointed and it was a waste of my money. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody."
3,Pretty stinkin' good,"Since i work at a college radio station, I have had the pleasure of listening to Beulah's brand-spanking new album before it comes out in stores. For the record, it's pretty good. The sound evokes similarities between them and the Beach Boys. Brian Wilson is the latest indie craze, to which Beulah does not fail to milk. Rich harmonies mix with lo-fi guitar to produce a thoroughly seductive sound. If you dig Apples in Stereo and The Promise Ring, then surely you will like this record."
2,Kind of a shame...,"I'll have to agree with the other reviewers that most of the songs aren't really catchy. However, the last track (If we can send a man to the moon, then surely I can win your heart) is REALLY good. Hopefully Beulah's next release has more like it."
5,"This is an incredible band, not too often do they sound this good","I really love Beulah. I have to say I have quite the fondness for them. It started from hearing TCINC, and it really astounded me. It had so much life in it. He was hurting on all the songs but through a wonderful chorus of joy.I for some reason hesitated in getting the other albums right away, I think it's cause there weren't that many. But this one, ooh boy this is great. To see where this band has travelled and to know that they truly like to get better and better. It's not that they improved their sound on TCINC, they were just trying on a different outfit.Yoko is really good too, but don't ever expect to hear more of the same thing, Beulah are wonderful like that, they want you to enjoy their music, not think about how it should sound."
1,too gimmicky,"You can't hide a crappy song behind a seemingly sophisticated arrangement. All the ""cool indie bands"" are trying to orchestrate. I hate to say, it takes much, much more. Start with a good song, and some emotion. I hope Beulah will go back to really crafting their songs, and writing, and less hiding behind meaningless, and sterile sounding instrumentation."
1,disappointed,"I could'nt get into the songs, they did not stick. I did not like the strings, they are too sappy. The horn parts are ok but put me in mind of high school marching band/ college football game melodies. Oh yeah, and hasn't there been enough Sitar, Tabla, traditional indian instrumentation in pop music yet? (um.. Beatles etc;) Please stay off the Beach Boys bandwagon too!! How bout better songs next time around?"
1,overrated,"after all the good things i had read about this album, i was very dissapointed when i was actually listening to it. yes, there is some violins, horns, and orchestral stuff on it. the songs are weak though - you can't flesh out weak songs w/ alot of instruments and hope to have an album. there are no standout cuts on this album. sounds like a cousin of Green Day, to be honest. Elephant 6 is the most overrated collective ever - only two good bands, Of Montreal and The Essex Green."
1,same old stuff,"beatles and beach boys have done all this before. try something of your own. poor song writing, none of the tunes stick. sorry nice try"
1,This Is Not The Real Beulah,"This is not the real Beulah. The early 1980's artist who's hits included ""A Woman In Love"" and ""It Hurts To Be Hurt,"" and who was featured on tv's Real People. Do NOT be fooled by this artist trying to use her name! I knew the real Beulah and this artist is no Beulah."
2,Nice try,"Pretty lame. None of the songs stick; the melodies just aren't there. Everything sounds pretty much the same also, like a '60s bargain bin band. Even the much-heralded ""Emma Blowgun's Last Stand"" just builds on and on forever on a silly seven-note motif, with assorted weird sounds inserted to, ostensibly, create some variety in the midst of the monotony. Then the brass kicks in with annoying 17-note riff that just goes on and on forever, replacing the 7-note theme. Finally, about 2:40 into the song, the vocals kick in with a really lame melody that basically repeats the same exact notes four times and calls that a ""verse."" This goes on for three verses. Then more of the 17-note brass thing, until finally the song ends at about 5:20. Too bad the song doesn't really even make a good 2:00 minute song, let alone one that nearly last 5 and a half minutes.The rest of the album is more of the same, only even less memorable."
5,nothing gimmicky.,"this album is smart. i just heard word that their debut 'handsome western states' is now out of print (hence why my review that i put up of that album at least a year and a half ago is now gone)i'm convinced that beulah (and other elephant six artists, as previously mentioned) are doing the freshest thing i have ever heard in music in a long time. pay attention to the bands -- especially beulah and neutral milk hotel, olivia tremor control too. because they are a phenomenon.this album is completely brilliant, catchy and well arranged. lyrics that sound straight out of a memory you've already had. nostalgia at its' best, only miles kurosky and friends are not fighting for the words that are on the tip of their tongue like we all do. in fact, the lyrics and melodies and honesty of this album flow quite freely.hands down one of the best albums i own."
4,music for a summer afternoon,I can understand both the more positive and less positive reviews for this album. The songs are pleasantly flowing but somewhat similar sounding. It is not a question of outright repetition though; it's more like a piece with a theme and variations on that theme. Another thing to consider is that the mixes are quite complex with various instruments popping in and fading out. This will definitely make more musical sense on a better audio system or on a high quality computer audio player that can upsample to 24/192. The lyrics and tunes are just trippy enough and complex enough to create a pleasant vibe. I'm surprised I still listen to this album after having it for 10 years.
5,Great for homeschoolers!,"I homeschooled my 3 older children and will homeschool my little one too. This book will be on our list of Civil War reads. I find it to be excellent. I have read other civil war books that never touch the heart like this one does. At 144 pages it won't take forever to get though, but it is packed with substance. Not a moment or page is wasted."
3,A Little Too Predictible,"A lot of the story elements in How I Found The Strong are similar to other Civil War tales in which a good-hearted slave must rely on a white boy to perform somewhat super-human feats in order to save him. Gritty battle scenes and grisly accounts of medical conditions. Some 10-11 year olds may be put off by the length of the narrative journey, at 300+ pages. Try the literary standard, Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, or for a different twist on the Civil War theme: Trembling Earth by Kim Siegelson or The River Between Us by Richard Peck."
5,A fantastic conclusion to the Tillerman saga...,"At 21, Dicey Tillerman thinks she has enough knowledge to become a success. Dropping out of college a year earlier to begin a boatbuilding business, Dicey finds out the hard way that she doesn't have nearly enough life experience to take on such an enormous venture singlehandedly. But she keeps persisting, determined to make her lifelong dream a success...even if it means ignoring the needs of her family, and those of her boyfriend Jeff, whom she always thought would be there for her, no matter what. Dicey should have learned by now that no one ever has to stay anywhere..."
4,This is a good book!,"Seventeen against the Dealer is a great book. I read it twice in the last two months; it is so good. You will really like this if you've read any of the Tillerman Series before this, but this book stands on its own well too."
1,Not my favorite,"This is easly my least favorite of the Tillerman books that I have read )Homecoming, Dicey's Song, Sons From Afar and Seventeen Against the Dealer). I personally found Dicey so unlikable in this book that I had trouble finishing it. Gone is the Dicey who would do anything for her family. She's been replaced by a Dicey is more childish than her 13 year old self who guided her siblings to a safe haven in ""Homecoming"". All we get here is ""I WANNA BUILD BOATS"" (stomp, stomp, stomp!) She was more caring and mature as a child than as a supposed adult."
3,My least favorite...,"This was my least favorite of the books in the Tillerman saga. I began to wonder why Jeff put up with Dicey all these years. She come off as very unlikeable (IMHO). It was nice to see the family as they got older, and it would be GREAT if Cynthia Voigt would write another one...what about Uncle John (alluded to in Homecoming)?"
2,Remote,Does not work in this jeep. Checked with manufacture and it does have remote option. Key and lock company could not get it to work.
4,Great book plenty of detail ...but....,Great book plenty of detail ...but.... They should have dispensed with the lengthy detail on slant 6s.Reccomend for build info for 600 and less hp.
2,kindle version poorly formatted,"The low rating is for the kindle version only, which was so poorly formatted as to make me put off reading Rowe's book until I can get it out of the library. Periods are frequently used instead of commas, dates are split across lines and the endnotes are not linked, which in my experience means they might as well not exist for the good they do me."
4,Learned,"This book got me thinking about the aquifers that rest underneath my residence. This book got me thinking about history for the first time since sixth grade. I wanted to read more memoir. I feel like after the first 1/3 of this book it was only historical, which is all right with me, but it didn't make me tingle as much as it could've had it been more human. I don't live in L.A. I've walked around L.A though. I've walked from UCLA all the way to that theater, and I bought a pomegranate and learned how to eat that strange fruit. I went to Trader Joe's and bought vodka and went back to our Toyota Dolphin and drank it with orange juice while a strange man walked around the Dolphin with a boombox. I didn't know about this book back then. Had I known about it I would've visited Lakewood and marveled at the never-ending row of single trees planted on the berms."
3,Wasteland?,"I grew up in the rural Midwest and have always been put off by suburbs. Admittedly, this book is clearly and economically written. Admittedly, it is thoroughly researched concerning the land and water on which Lakewood stands. Yet,the life at which the book hints seems so restricted, so circumscribed, and so stereotyped that I have a difficult time understanding the appeal of this book to so many readers. Is it that someone has at last accurately described their poverty of experience?"
3,This book starts out strong..,"I had bought this book several years ago--and I just picked it up the other day. I was drawn in from the beginning of the book-- but when I got to the last 1/4 of it, I was seriously thinking of throwing the towel in. But, I didn't and it didn't get much better. I patiently waited until I got to the pages with the photographs, and I thought those were very interesting. I can't rate this book more than 3 stars..I wouldn't strongly recommend it either."
3,Disappointing,"After reading an excerpt of ""Holy Land: A Suburban Memoir"" in ""Writing Los Angeles,"" I looked forward to reading the entire work much praised by Joan Didion a writer that I admire.Unfortunately, I was disappointed by ""Holy Land's"" lack of focus and sprawling, often times out of control prose.The concept is remarkable: writing a biography of a city (Lakewood, California) and detailing it's construction, it's history, the financial and social history of it's founders and the personal history of Waldie and his family.But it just doesn't work. What it lacks is a fire, an inner life, and the guts that pull all the disparate facts, foibles and attitudes together. As it is, it mostly just rambles from one subject to another without the unifying spark of passion."
5,Amazing!!!,"It was amazing to read about life behind the battle lines of the Civil War. To see the conflict through the eyes of an innocent child imparted new meaning. The historical details are incredible, as are the illustrations!"
4,"****Small Voice, Bigger Impact****","This book is the story of a woman writing about her childhood which took place before, during, and after the Civil War in Kentucky. Alma was an orphan who goes to live with her elderly aunt in the country and makes friends whose family has slaves where her and aunt do not. Alma must grow up somewhat early, but that is only part of the story.Sometimes the story kind of wanders into descriptions of remedies and gardens, but if you think about it it only adds credibility to the old lady reminiscing about her memories.There is even some mystery thrown into the mix, and the end is very satisfying, which is something every good book must have.I also enjoyed the cute little drawings of the different plants and animals that Alma seen growing up and added to her margins."
2,soso,The game was not as much fun as it was discribed . My kids did not even want to play it so I did and it is slow and gets boring . I finish it Quick and then its just repeteing . DULL DULL
5,The Beauty of Male,"I was also breathless as I looked through the pages of men. They were incredibly beautiful.My favorite picture is of the two men in bed together, naked. There is a tenderness to their picture that is absolutely beautiful.This book is a wonderful celebration of the male form."
4,Adonis: Masterpieces of Male Erotic Photography,"At the first crack of this book, I stood breathless, staring at the beauty of the male form and at the quality of the photographs. This book features not only modern photographs, but equally impressive older shots of outstanding male specimens. The book is quite exciting to slowly peruse and the name of the book duly expresses what subject is uncovered within the bindings. A great addition to a photo lovers collection of books."
1,Masterpieces? Erotic? I think not,"This book was highly anticipated as I was looking forward to viewing artful photography featuring unclothed men. What I realized once I got to the end was that I felt extremely cheated, disappointed, what have you. The poses were nothing special, the men were primarily young to very young looking, fit and/or athletic. How does this qualify for masterpiece status? And as for the ""erotic"" promise of the title, I just didn't see it. Pretty boys, attractive men, a couple crossdressers, none of whom were remarkable or even memorable. There was no exhibition of energy, no emotion, no anything. I swear if I had a fancy camera I could do better! I'll admit that there were a few that captured my eye, but for a volume containing about 200 images, this book falls way short of its Greek namesake."
2,Not much erotica,"The books contains about 196 pictures. Of those, about 35 contain full frontal nudity.A few of the models look good but the title of the book is really misleading. If you want to look at an Adonis in a book then you must buy a book, but not this one!"
3,Strong but spotty,"3 1/2Another amazing live performance from the undisputed master of violin jazz fusion (as if he had many competitors) may be a pleasant addition for fans already rounding out their collection of Mr. Ponty's dazzling technical proficiencies, but avoids wider recognition from a sometimes rambling disharmony paired with a less then flattering production."
1,Reviews ARE Helpful!,"I wish I had read this review before buying this product. I purchased it from CVS and the box does NOT contain a liner in which to place the soil. Only a wire basket (through which the soil can fall out, of course). Not a good idea. I'm not sure it is even practical to sell all of the other components if you do not offer a liner to hold the actual seeds and soil along with it.Do read the reviews posted before buying items -- they are really helpful."
2,Warning!,"Warning! These are not the original recordings of these songs, they are reproductions that are all performed by the same female vocalist. Buyer beware!"
3,"NOT FOR WINDOWS ""ME""","I'M SURE THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT.BUT I HAVE WINDOWS ""ME"" AND IT WILL NOT RUN WITH WINDOWS ""ME"".IT WILL RUN WITH WINDOWS '95,'98 AND '98SE,BUT NOT ""ME"".IT NEEDS CERTAIN DOS FEATURES THAT ""ME"" DOESN'T HAVE.THE TECH SUPPORT AT CURTIS WAS VERY GOOD,SO I'M SURE THIS WILL WORK AS STATED."
1,???,"I give this a one star rating and no Title because I have not been able to use it. It says that it is not compatable with Windows NT... I dont have NT or 2000 for that matter. I wanted to get it for a lil extra security, so I can take the big ugly chassis locks off of my computer... I got it for $19.95 as well......"
2,Meh,"This was by far the worst book I've ever read. Irrelevant quotes from famous people that aren't necessarily educated on the topic, extremely redundant, real basic info without any straight answers, some hypothetical situations that aren't pertinent to it, it's just 200 pages of fluff. If you've never once thought about the future of music then maybe this would give you an idea of what's happening."
5,The Future of Music,"I own a huge library of books on the music industry and The Future of Music is by far the most helpful and insightful. The music business is going through drastic changes and this book provides a well rounded look into all aspects of the industry. The best part is that Dave and Gerd shows us a great forward thinking view into the future.I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in music, but especially musicians."
2,Alright already!,"This is a case of a lot of filler to make what could be communicated in a short essay into a book. The basic message ""The music industry has to embrace digital technology."" This and a few other salient points are made early in the book and then repeated with different wording ad nauseum. I would suggest standing in the store, reading the introductory stuff and skimming the rest. Too many authors are doing this these days. It should have been a magazine article."
1,Computer Generated Audio Book,"I'm very dissatisfied with the audio book I bought. My first. This is a very good computer reading of the book. But it's far from human and it's very boring. If this was a short pdf, ok, but a 6 hour book. My first experience with audiobooks is a bad one. I don't recommend anyone buying the audio book."
3,One-sided,"I guess back in 2007 it was worthy book to read, at least to wake up and jump on the train of digital music. But now authors should seriously re-evaluate this book with ""future"" tendencies. To sum up the main idea: choose streaming, instead of selling!Ok, streaming is probably a solution. Probably, because I don't see how the majors will feed their artists, if p2p fans will pay let's say $15 for unlimited access to media? It's too little to have cost recoup! And what about jailbreaks of streamed media? It cuts again your commission.It's weak book for the Berklee college of music, and I'm suspicious that it was build up for the Online Berklee course ""The Future of Music and the Music Business"" where this document is required. I'm wondering what you can learn further about Future of Music for friendly $1400? Personally, I would prefer crash regularly on MIDEM and catch up with visioneers there for that money."
3,Something is amiss.,"I haven't yet read this book, but I did go to the Berklee College of Music; and there is no Research Institute. So something in this description is plain wrong."
1,Not factual enough.,"This book is a terrible book in my opinion and anyone who thinks that it is good needs to question their intelligence. It is not based enough on facts and is full of personal perceptions, opinions, and myths of the author himself. Not recommended to anyone who is a music maker or true consumer. Quality music is expensive to create and very time consuming. That is a fact that Mr. Kusek fails to point out."
1,Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2005 ... isn't,"Recently purchased, unable to get game to start properly, produces and inaccurate error statement related to screen resolution then locks up system. To date NO response from support group.Neighbor also has had trouble getting program to run properly on his system."
1,bad deal,Game will not run on my H P. Dangerous Hunt and Deer Hunt 2005 work just fine. Not much help from activision. Don't buy it. Dangerous hunt is great!
4,People's houses are windows on their souls. . .,"This look at the way people's houses reflect themselvesand their relationships with others is a wonderful hybridof scholarship and popularization. Kron writes formagazines, but her insights come from anthropology,sociology and psychology -- and she's got a wonderfulsense of humor. If you've ever wondered about roped offliving rooms, guest towels which are never usedor cheap soap in an expensively sybaritic shower, this isthe book for you. It's a deceptively easy and pleasant read,the anecdotes so nicely illustrating her points that Ireread it every couple years."
4,As good as the TV show,If you can't get enough of Jeopardy this is the game to buy. Plays very much like the television game without lots of repeat questions.
1,More Problems than any other DVD,"I do video recording at church. I have used 20 different brands with very few problems recording on a SANYO DVD recorder. I have tried Maxell twice now and have to say, they are the worse quality DVD I have ever used. Out of a pack of 25, 12 would not record and got a disc error in the DVD recorder. I also had a pack of 15 that I had to go through 3 DVDs before one would record. Saved to ones that would not record to use on computer recording. After using them on the computer to copy videos. Two of the three I burned on the computer were unreadable.Contacted Maxell months ago and they emailed me back and stated if I mailed the bad ones back they would replace them. Okay, let me see, pay $10 to ship 10 DVDs back to Maxell when I can buy 50 pack of another brand for $11 that works everytime."
3,"Okay product, bad shipping","It took 3 weeks for this item to ship. And then almost a week for it to arrive once it was shipped. The box was 4 times the size of the spindle, and the only protective packaging was a air cushion thing on the side. This left 75% of the container unprotected and when I received it the case was broken. Dics are okay, but would be nice to have something to hold them in now."
1,too many defective discs,"I used to think my dvd burner on my computer was defective.. then I bought a spindle of Verbatim DVDs. Every single one worked! So I thought.. maybe my older spindle of Maxell were just old and suffered from some sort of use by date. So I just bought a new (small) spindle of maxell from Tesco, because that's all they had. I should have bought the store brand ones. The first disc burned fine, the second was defective, the third took a long time to get going. I'll never buy Maxell again."
5,Duplication of my VHS collection,Have had no errors yet with this disk format and am very satisfied thus far. I bought two manufacturers just in case I had problems with one of them but haven't had to open the other pack yet.
5,they are good,i use this products just to record shows or novels. They work great. either i keep it or throw them away after watching them. Price was great
2,review DVD+R,"no problems. i repeat no problems. i really like these. like i said, i have had no problems. Good stuff."
5,Maxell quality. What can you say.,"I use a PYE model DVD home recorder and it works flawlessly with this media. You stay with what works, right?"
4,Great desk reference,"This is an excellent desk reference for anyone in a manufacturing or purchasing job role, students, or those with a curiosity about engineering materials, and why certain materials and processes are called out for specific applications. Covers metals, ceramics, plastics, and composites. This is a college level text, but is not overly difficult reading. Includes numerous photos, illustrations, tables, diagrams, and figures for comparison and enhanced understanding."
1,Not what I expected,I ordered the 9th edition and he sent me the 6th edition. When I asked for my money back he said there was going to be a restocking fee.
3,Engineering Material: Properties and Selection (8th Edition),This was the required reading for the Ball State University (ITMFG 262) and Purdue University equivilent (MET 141). The only reason I bought it was because I had too. Hopefully it will be a good resource in my future engineering career.
2,A Rambling Oral History,"I was quite disappointed in this book. I had not read a detailed history of the battle, and only knew the basic outline from general histories of the war. This book added little to my knowledge. It gives little overall perspective of the battle. Much of it essentially an oral history, based on a number of interviews with participants. Because of this, it gives the reader a fairly good feel for the experience of the soldiers in the field, while imparting little information about the big picture. The author's background is in radio, and it shows in this book. If you know all about this battle and would like an oral history, this book may be of interest. For me, it was a major disappointment."
4,Amazing stuff,"Amazing 2-CD document of British/European free jazz in the late 60's/early 70's. The first CD is The Trio - John Surman on reeds, Barre Phillips on bass, Stu Martin on drums; the second CD finds them joined by a variety of other musicians. The songs are challenging in an Ornette Coleman sort of way but never inaccessible. Not a recording for the casual jazz listener - it's more for the adventurous jazz lover."
4,Wicked!,"Take it from the screaming witch doctor in Watusi Zombie, this is the album for you. This CD will suck you back to 1962. It is not top forty stuff and certainly not anything you would ever hear on an oldies radio station. However, if you like cool guitar instrumentals, you'll like this. In addition to the instrumentals, Guitar Star is the one song with vocals on the CD (no offense to the witch doctor!). It's probably the craziest album you've ever bought but, damn it is fun."
4,Dance music with an IQ,"Well crafted songs, catchy rhythms, and intelligent lyrics combine to make this one of the great (and also unsung) albums of the eighties. Great value for money, pity they never made it big. But, then it wouldn't be something you could introduce your friends to, would it?"
4,a toe tappin body movin must!,"these guys really know how to make a person move! if you are looking for an insomnia remody,dont listen to this cd"
5,one of 80s best,"I had the cassette back then,but eventually got eaten up by my tapeplayer.Couldn't replace it ever since.What a shame.Somebody start reprinting it on cd,for crying out loud.Amazing how some of those crappy band from that era have everything re-issued yet this gem's been out of print for ages.Can't blame the sellers for such high prices.But i have my limits for rare items.Just too bad that this great album cannot be readily enjoyed by everyone."
4,What a great story,"When I first saw this book, I thought it would be a typical wrestling book. I was way off! This is a journal of Jerry Jarrett, his son Jeff, and the process of starting a wrestling company. I was glued to this book. Its 2002, and Jerry and Jeff were starting a wrestling company. They had investors and then at the last minute they would back out. The same occured witht some top name wrestlers that were freinds with Jeff would back out as well. This is a story of the grueling yet rewarding process of upstarting a wrestling company from the ground up. Literally! A must read for the wrestling fan who wants to understand the business side of wrestling."
3,Not quite what I expected...,"I'd been wanting to read this book for a while. While not a bad read, I expected more of a journal of Jarrett's storyline and booking ideas (why he chose to push who he did, why he thought the Dupps would get over, what the hell he was thinking with The Johnsons, etc). Instead, you get more of a business side perspective. So many entries are ""Went to a business meeting to meet with X potential investor."" ""Had a meeting with a bank."" ""Had a meeting with a PPV carrier."" While it's an interesting story, I would have preferred more wrestling related info. Some interesting tidbits here and there save this book, but it's just ok."
5,inside a wrestling premotion,"This book is really a good read,Not only does he tell of getting a new prowrestling premotion going,But how it affects him and his family and health.The only way Mr Jarett could do any better is to write his autobiography.I know that I can't be the only fan who would love for him to do just that.I would love to preorder that book.Please Mr Jarett write you'r life story and includ lots of stories of the wrestlers like Jackie Fargo and the other names of the 60's.Thanks for the great work you have done.A fan of you'rsDiane eldridge."
4,Worth A Listen,"I never figured out why this album always seems to get a bad rap. Of the three Flash albums I own, this one seems to get the most play in my CD player. Because the songs are shorter in length than previous Flash albums I think some people tend to think it is a commerical attempt at pop music and not worthy of being labeled progressive rock. There are plenty of progressive thrills to be had here. It contains some of Peter Banks' best guitar work and the band as a whole sounds much tighter than the previous albums. True, there are a couple of slow spots, but really only a couple, and the same can be said about the two previous Flash albums. If you are a fan of either of the first two Flash albums, I wouldn't pass this one up."
4,Interesting!,"This book is very complete and interesting but in order to really appreciate it you must complete the ""real life"" experiments throughout, so you tend to need to dedicate a lot of time to it."
1,ok but not what I expected,"I expected a book on how to read body language. This book does NOT do that. He really focuses on how my body should look. That is about it. Not a whole lot of great information. The exercises they suggest are not good. When you are done with the book, you realize that body language is important that our understanding of it should be better. But AGAIN that is it."
3,An interesting little book,"This was a quick and easy to access little guidebook. For the most part it is accurate and helpful. I enjoyed it and it has been useful to me. It is not an academic approach with a lot of analysis but more of a straightforward ""this means this"" sort of book."
3,Great Leather feel but minor problems may keep you away from the product,"Great Leather feel and quality but plastic screen need major improvements. First case that I've purchased had some unremovable stain on it along with tiny scratches that distract from viewing videos.Exchanged case was well built as well except for the same annoying tiny scratches all over the plastic screen.Second issue is when you flip the front cover to see the display, the cover bends the headphone input wire due to the lack of sufficient spacing. Since Ipod headphones have an extra protection for 1/2 inch it may become an issue ...Bottom line is ... great for carrying your video Ipod around and browse for song selection but not so much for video podcasts."
1,too light to be a paperweight,"I bought this wall charger for my LG VX4650 - unfortunately it does not really work for my phone. I get ""Battery Charged"" notices on my phone after about 30 seconds of being connected to this charger.I bought this wall charger thru Amazon from BargainCell.Note: while this cheapo charger did not work for my VX4650 i have purchased other inexpensive chargers from BargainCell which have worked perfectly for other phones. It's a gamble but i would still purchase the inexpensive charger."
1,eat a fig bar instead,"This product was a big disappointment. The picture on the box is misleading. These bars aren't chunky, the dough isn't flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren't filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn't read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that ""yogurt powder"" is added), you wouldn't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all. The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the ""natural flavorings,"" etc. Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a ""vitamin blend"" -- there's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway. The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar -- only not as tasty. The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. I'd rather eat one of them. I won't be purchasing this product again."
2,Not terribly appealing,"These aren't as good as other bars of this type. My kids won't eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative."
5,Works like a charm,"I've had occasional cold sores since I was a kid. Usually this meant suffering through 3-4 days of active sores, which itch and hurt (and look unsightly), then up to a week or more after they ""break"" of healing. I've tried several different remedies, but so far, this stuff is by far the best product I've tried. At the very first inkling that a cold sore is coming on, I start using it. As a lip balm, it's really soft, making application easy, and helping to sooth and protect. And, the medicated ingredients do wonders for reducing the length and ferocity of my cold sores. If I start using this immediately, I typically will only have 1 or 2 days of active sores, and often they do not even break, making healing much fast as well. And, the price is fantastic for the value. Can't recommend this enough!"
5,excellent product,Can't live without this -- suffer from cold sores. best product. i've tried them all. seem to be unavailable in stores (used to get it at Target.) Now i order 3-5 at a time.
3,its okay,"tbh, i really like the lysine lip balm alot more but this one works like a charm also so if you want something alittle cheaper i would reccommend buying from here just because this thing cost less on here than at publix which is $9"
5,Great protection wit Herpecin-L,Best ever. I've used this for several years now and it's the only product that seems successful to prevent and alleviate cold sores.
1,Very ineffective as cold sore treatment,"Hepecin-L claims to be an anti-cold sore medication. However, as James Koenig points out in his review, Herpecin-L is little more than a sunscreen.I can always detect an impending outbreak of cold sores, and thus when I acted quickly to apply Herpecin-L to my lips, I found that it made no difference. The cold sore breakout erupted, and the Herpecin-L did nothing to alleviate them. If anything, I would almost say that it exacerbated the growth of the sores, simply because the sores felt even more irritated after application. I saw no difference during the breakout of sores after repeated applications; it was as if I was doing nothing at all.Herpecin-L is little more than glorified chapstick. If you're looking for real fever sore(cold sore) treatment, I highly recommend Abreva."
5,An outstanding film with outstnding actors!,A rare find; however; any picture with Spacek or Lemmon is usually superb
5,"Sissy and Jack are superb, great important true story","I loved this film from beginning to end for so many reasons. One is the superb performances by Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon. 2. The story is so emotion provoking, maddening, saddening, and true. 3. Gravas' direction is great and he perfectly captures the atmosphere of Chile after the fascist Pinochet coup (backed by the USA). 4. The theme music by Vangelis is great atmospheric haunting very appropriate background. 5. Anyone who doesn't know much about the effects of US foreign policy must see this film to learn the truth."
3,No subtitles to be had,"The film is excellent. It's easy to see why it was nominated for and won so many awards. However, my DVD did not come with any subtitles, either CC or accessible through the disc menu."
4,very good book clear,a want to see a great book i was told i like it loved it worth spending time in front of the tube
4,Missing,wonderful suspense story. Great to see Sissy and jack working together. David Clennon makes a great nasty guy.
4,A Powerful and Emotional Human Drama!,"Costa-Gravas first American film carries his stamp, bit it is a little more manipulative than he's used to. The film works better because of the powerful performances by Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek. A great oscar-winning screenplay (co-scripted by Costa-Gravas) and a powerful true story lift the emotional impact. Jack Lemmon really shines as the searching father, he plays an a-typical role for him, a man who's quietly struggling with his inner feelings, and Sissy Spacek is great as always as the wife of Charles. Great Movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
4,you mean this really happened?,"Wasn't Kissinger and Nixon in power in the USA in September of 1973? This is a true story? Well that means that Kissinger really is a war criminal! Well let me see, the coup in Chile occured in September,1973. This movie says the americans were behind the coup. Charles Horman was murdered by those responsible for the coup. So that means the american government murdered one of its own citizens because he was a leftist. By the way Jack Lemmon plays the father of Charles Horman in this movie and Sissy Spacek plays the wife of the murdered american Golly,what a depressing movie!"
2,Equivocacion con caracteristicas de producto,"MissingYo mande a comprar la pelicula Missing con lenguaje en Español, de hecho la orden de compra asi lo indicaba, pero a la hora de que me llego el DVD no viene en EspañolAgradezco me puedan ayudar a enviar la pelicula correcta o me la cambien por otra que pueda elegir"
5,Missing,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Jack Lemmon was superb. I enjoy watching this movie times and times again. It is worth every penny paid.
5,Hoping for the full ending...,"I saw this movie in the theater when it was released and was incredibly moved by it.When I saw the movie years later on TV, the ending I remembered was conspicuously absent, likely due to scheduling timeslots. In the theater ending, Jack Lemmon does a voice-over explaining what happened after he and Beth left Chile. I do hope that the DVD will include this original ending because it really ""puts a period on the end of the sentence"" and invites the viewer to open their eyes just a little bit wider to the world in which we live. MISSING will give viewers a sense of what it's like to live in a country that doesn't have the same freedoms we do here in the US but does not shirk its responsibility to identify why we do business in these countries.It's a very sobering film and I would recommend it to high school age and up. Great cinematography, haunting music, lots of tension."
1,"What's ""Missing"" are ANTI-Communist Films","I dare anyone to try and locate ""To Kill A Priest"" or ""Eleni"". The first features Ed Harris and the latter features the steller John Malkovich. Yet BOTH of these films are ""Missing"", why? Because they 'dared' to be anti-Communist films, a major caveat no-no! Apparently Stalinistic censorship is still alive and well in Hollywood, EVEN in the age of YOUTUBE and the internet, BOTH films are nowhere to be found. Find either and prove me wrong! This IS NOT AMERICA!"
5,This is a marvellous book on B&W printing,This book is not only a collection of great photographs. It is also a book that explains in detail how the printer evaluates the straight print and then proceeds to make the fine print. At the beginning many general aspects of printing with multigrade paper are discussed. Some advice for HW is also given. After this short introduction comes the main part: The printing process of many photojournalistic/glamour/still life photographs (really good ones!) is explained. First comes the straight print. Then comes a sketch of the burn-in/dodging procedure. The subjective opinion/reason of the printer for each step is also stated. Finally comes the fine print. One main idea that pervades the whole book is the idea of local contrast. This alone can improve the craft of many newcomers to B&W printing. Reading this book has opened my mind as to what good printing is capable of and I believe that my printing has improved since then.
2,Geri BLAHiwell,"I would just like to say , that this song is not all that great. The remix's I admit are good, though, but the song is blah. Geri has an awful voice and can't hold a note at all. Did she get this record deal in a contest? Becuase whoever signed her is nuts !"
3,The video is great! but ...,"Geri Halliwell was by far my favorite spice girl. Now she has gone solo and I love her work, she hasn't dissapointed her fans. This single is pretty nice, I like the slow ""Lift Me Up"" and of course I adore the cute video where she's in the desert hanging out and having fun with some aliens, but the rest of the tracks on this CD single, just don't measure up. They are too R&B-ish for me, and of course ""Live and Let Die"" is a rock cover, which I am not TOO fond of. Her next single ""Bag It Up"" is much better than this one."
4,Great station/semi difficult construction,"Well manufactured with great details. A fun addition to my HO Scale train layout, however, very difficult to construct the awning portion. Roof will not stay strait without leaning."
2,Must be extremely versatile in gluing small pieces,"This kit came in very small pieces and you have to glue everything. While I can build things, I am not great at gluing things and the end result looked terrible. I ended up throwing this out and will purchase one already assembled or with very little gluing."
3,Pretty Good Considering The Price...,I use this phone in my classroom and I bought it for my girlfriend. It is a portable phone that works fairly well. Her complaint is that apparently it doesn't ring sometimes. I've never noticed that with my phone but that's not to say that it doesn't happen.
3,HO Platform Shelter,This platform can be used several ways . 1st. An extension for Atlas Model #706 Platform Staion. 2nd Freestanding with two sections together . 3rd. As two freestanding stations .It is a nice station for the price . However .the station accessories are much too delicate .Since I am using them as trolley platforms I don't need the baggage handling stuff so I'm satisfied with it .
1,Bad product even worse warranty,Stainless discolored in few weeks and the ignitor failed after 30 days and Char-broil would not replace the ignitor part. Char-broil warranty bogus and there customer service dept is unreasonanble! A terrible product and even worse warranty. Do not buy! You will be very sorrry!
1,Worst Unit ever.,"Hi, I bought this unit 6 months ago and the first one was defective right out of the box. That's when i should've asked for my money back. Instead I allowed them to exchange it and now 6 months later the unit is dead. I've treated it with very good care and the buttons still managed to get stuck. Please save your money and buy ANYTHING else."
2,Disappointed after reading the book,"I enjoyed the book format of this quite a bit, but found the cd a disappointment. Not sure if it was his voice or the presentation in general, but I ended up donating it."
4,This is in reply to fruitloop,"I am hesitant but feel it neccessary to say that its important to review a book by making meaningful and informed post about the actual object that your reviewing, and not going off on tangents about jewish evangelistic whatever! I am not currently a student of the kabblah centre but have been, and possibly could be. WHat they teach is just as meaningful and realistic as what is being taught anywhere else in the world. Just because you see celebrities and individuals wearing the red string and make uninformed opinions without any real thought or effort put into discovering the true meaning behind their faith, does not make someone or some group uneffective or un-important.I have had a chance to participate in a conference by the rabbi on this book. It is very very helpful regardless of your religuous background. The key lessons and points that are made are universal and can change your life if you allow it to do so."
2,Trendy Kabbalah rah rah,"For my money I much prefer the books authored by Z'ev Ben Shimon Halevi. His work is internationally recognized by the esoteric community for many decades . He has a great many books in print. I would start with ""Tree of Life: An Introduction to Cabala,"" ""School Of Kabbalah,"" ""A Kabbalistic Universe,"" and his more advanced tomes are indespensible to the serious student. ""Kabbalah and Psychology,"" ""Kabbalah and Exodus,"" are brilliant.His unique and profond understanding of the ""Tree of Life"" set him ahead of the recent writers on this ancient Jewish mystical tradition.I am particularly fond of ""Adam and the Kabbalistic Tree""He is of the Cordeverian School, as opposed to the Lurianic.His Kabbalistic work on astrology is a must for anyone interested in that subject. The book is back in print; ""The Anatomy of Fate."""
5,Riveting though distubing,"This book was such a ride...at first I didn't really jive with the evil nature of the characters but, I found myself engrossed nonetheless. The end was shocking and I liked it very much. I was sorry to see it end with so many questions unanswered - this is the kind of book I'd like to have a sequel to. I've heard the author is working on a new book and I look forward to reading it when it comes out. Kaufman is obviously a writer with much talent and it only remains to be seen what he will apply himself to next, I'm sure it will be another interesting ride."
2,The performances are very nice -- HOWEVER...,"...FIRE THE SOUND ENGINEER!...the recording is poor...simply put, you can barely hear the violin...the violin sounds like a mosquito buzzing over the freight train of sound coming from the piano...I don't think it's Midori's fault -- she appears to be pushing the violin as far it can go...Heifetz used to lean on recording engineers to get the piano pushed further into the background and someone should have done that here."
4,Fascinating Document,"Some might say Midori's understanding of the music she plays is not quite as profound as what one expects from great musicians. Some might not like to watch her play because it is too tensed physically, especially her bow arm. But none will be able to dismiss the fact that Midori is nothing short of amazingly incredible. I am never a really big fan of Midori but I can't help but admiring her. This DVD is absolutely fascinating to watch. On contrary to some reviewers' opinion, the program includes some of the most challenging pieces in violin solo literature.However, I'm not too sure the balance problem between the violin and piano was the engineer's fault. Midori doesn't really have a very big sound in live concerts."
3,For the average home repairman,"Good articles and frequent tips on how to fix stuff. Some of the articles often repeat from time to time. Many articles on unique space saving ideas using shelves and cabinets. Lots of pictures show you how to use tools like routers, saws, drills and wrenches in different ways."
4,Great NISSA GT-R video,"This is one of the best explanations about the car and the way to drive it in a circuit, ENJOYCongratulationsMarco"
1,Profiting from Other People's Work,"Why buy this book? The ""editor"" didn't write it, so why should she profit from it? You can see this on her website, reata.org, for free."
2,"Beware of modernized ""fluff""","While there is nothing inherently wrong with the sentiment express here, to attribute the words as quotes from God is a VERY dangerous practice. God did NOT say these things -- they are only the imaginations of a created being (the unknown author) attributed to the Creator.You'd do far better reading the Word of God Himself, the Holy Bible. That DID come from God."
1,Nonsense,"Is belief about the imaginary being we call God built into our gene stream? We live, we suffer, we die. There is no meaning and no purpose to existence. We are on our own in an indifferent, uncaring universe; we need to do the best we can. To imagine that a creature who would create a universe so full of suffering is ""Good"" and ""Great"" is much like people in abusive relationships. I am mystified why there is an endless stream of human creations praising this monster. It's time for human beings to grow up."
2,So small,"I thought the size of the book is 8x11, but it's merely 4x6. Should put the size there. Otherwise, the content is awesome."
4,Neil Young Live In 2000,"the actual title of this dvd is ""red rocks live"" and it is a great. it is a live show recorded sept 19 & 20, 2000. Neil performs a wide variety of material: motorcycle mama, powderfinger, everybody knows thia is nowhere, i believe in you (a standout!), unknown legend,razor love, mellow my mind, and a bunch more all in freezing colorado rain! but you get to see and hear it from the warmth of your cozy couch."
4,Neil Young - Red Rocks Live,"This DVD is a treat for Neil Young fans. The concert was threatened by storms, but Neil keeps playing through the cold wind and rain. The playlist is excellent and his sister performs as a back-up singer along with his wife. Neil puts on a solid show with his hair often flying in the howling wind... very cool performance."
4,Great,"If you're into Neil Young, this is a good one to have. This show must have been amazing for performer and audience alike. First, it's in a spectacular venue(Red Rocks), and second, a blustery cold front blows in during the show. Neil's hair is blown over the side of his face from the back, but it doesn't seem to affect him one bit. It's not the all time greatest concert film(that would be Stop Making Sense), but it's very good. A companion to this, which is also great, is Silver & Gold. That one's a lot different, finding Neil surrounded by about 15 guitars, alone on the stage, pouring Sierra Nevada into himself, and his heart out to the audience at another great venue, Bass Concert Hall on the UT-Austin campus."
2,"Great Performace, Very Short on Audio Quality","I liked the song set and overall concert performace, however, the audio sounded like an eight track and a bad pair of car speakers. If you are wanting a good concert visual with no wasted crowd shots then add this to your library. If you can't stand muffled audio, look for something else by Neil like the Heart of Gold DVD. --- My opinion, and like a nose, everyone has one."
2,Only Plays on the My Computer,Very disappointed I could not play it on my A/V system. I could only play it on my computer. The Zone Code was wrong.
4,Neil young Red Rocks,Why is it so hard to find the song list ! Why don't you have it on the main page with the listed DVD.
2,storm makes watching this dvd annoying,"As Neil Young is playing his concert, a storm is brewing and for me at least, it's so annoying watching the wind constantly blow his hair, etc. I love Neil Young, and the music is good, but not enjoyable to watch."
3,Lovely illustrations,"Young Rosalinda is awakened by a noise one night and discovers a man having taken all the lemons off her tree. The next day her tree appears to be sick. Her grandmother tells her that Anciana, an old woman can help. After much searching, Rosalinda finds Anciana who tells her how to heal the tree. The next morning her tree is full if fat ripe lemons. Rosalinda gives all her lemons away. Then she gives the biggest one to the man who stole her lemons in the first place. She tells him to take the seeds and use them to grow his own tree."
1,I really didn't see the point of this ...,"I really didn't see the point of this product. The only use I had for it was as an ordinary toothpick, because it didn't work any better than that. It's misleading to say it's a plaque remover when after brushing your teeth it removes nothing """"extra."""" I was disappointed in the product overall."
2,I really didn't think this product was much ...,I really didn't think this product was much different than an ordinary toothpick. I also didn't like the fact that only one side was pointed so it couldn't be flipped over to use on the other side. I wouldn't recommend this product.
3,music not for the kindle fire,"Although I enjoy reading on my kindle, after a year I am just beginning to explore music on this format. The music is wasted on the kindle. Azymuth sounds awful, and I know this is a great group, and I love Brazilian jazz, but please, sound quality is so poor on kindle that it certainly isnt worth the 7.99 that I spent. Maybe that's why you dont get good reviews for anything but books. Thus ends the noble experiment in listening to some music on my kindle. I guess that's why there are no free sound tracks for kindle--even free isn't worth the experience."
5,Excellent for exposed nerve in your tooth!!!!,"I lost a filling a while back, and this soon after led to pain, ear ache, and other complications associated with an exposed nerve. My dentist plans to do a root canal, post and cap, but in the mean time he put me on a strong antibiotic to heal the infected tooth, and then to place a temporary filling in the gap.The temporary filling worked just a few weeks before sensitivity and pain returned. Which was when I tried Gly-Oxide. On the first day, the pain went from severe to tolerable. By day 2, the pain was gone. And since then, I have used Gly-Oxide once each night to help prevent another infected tooth/nerve. Now, two weeks later, I find I can live a normal life, pain free.I highly recommend this product!"
5,Wish I Knew About This Sooner!,"Had a small cut on my gum, tried every rinse and it was still there. Painful, too. Found this and within 1 day, I was healed up. I now use it on my toothbrush every night - I had absolutely no gum bleeding at my last check up either. I won't be without this. Great product."
3,Leatherman sheath.,"This sheath is build tuff and seems to be good quality. In my case I have a few issues. I bought it to hold my Gerber tool and, it turned out to be a little small, and the mag light falls out of the holder when you turn it upside down, like when you are taking your belt off."
4,Leatherman,Good product. If you are looking for form fitting it sort of sticks out on belt. Can only hold certain flashlights. Magna lite is what I use and can fit holder. Good product overall.
5,Not just handy,"I am a field service tech and I always have a multitool and flashlight on my belt, which has two separate sheath. When I got this one, I only have to wear one sheath with my Wave and LED Maglite in it, all in one! Still using it for the past 3 years and planning to get another one."
3,Basic & very soft approach--worth 3.45 stars,"Admittedly, this is entitled ""The Roots..."" so it's pretty basic--mostly Theravada per Kornfield's training/master but including some Mahayana. He's very calm & soft voiced, which strangely I found annoying. It seems very ""Feeler"" oriented from a Myers-Briggs/Jungian perspective. There isn't much new or profound but it might be good as a starter--on the other hand his very fine book ""A Path with Heart"" is much better. I'd also recommend the works of Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron such as ""Taming the Mind"" & ""Working with Anger."""
1,"I'm sorry, what is this?","I ended up with this as a gag gift. Just out of curiosity, I looked it up and found it being sold here. It's basically a couple of tiny plastic and rubber figures that reek heavily of oil."
1,For the Christian who loves grunge music,"What a disappointment. And this from Maranatha! The song selections are the lure but after my purchase, I was so disappointed that the songs were recorded in the alternative music genre.The recording artists sound awkward and I don't recommend using this for any type of worship atmosphere. It's very distracting.Sorry but that's what I felt."
5,ET review,"The book was resonably priced, it was shipped promptly, it arrived in good shape, and it was what I was looking for. Well done."
2,"Crackers are fine, packaging isn't",Crackers are fine but the packaging isn't. Into my fourth or fifth box and haven't had a whole cracker that wasn't broken yet.
2,Good Tips on freezing foods - So far bland recipes,"I read this book cover to cover as soon as I received it. There are some really good tips on freezing. What can/can not be frozen, how long to freeze, what types of containers to use, etc.I thought the recipes themselves sounded ok, not exciting but tasty and healthy enough to start stocking my freezer.I made 2 of the recipes this weekend and was disappointed at how bland they both were. I will definitely use Trim and Terrific as a guideline for recipes, but will add my own twist to infuse flavor via herbs, spices, salt, pepper."
2,It's ok,"This book is ok, but most of the stuff is just substitute lowfat version of X for regular X. Compared to 150 of the world's healthiest 15 minute recipes, it's horrible. The 150 book is really cooking delicious super foods and it goes into intricate detail of every ingredients, the nutrients and WHY it's healthy. Also if you believe 150 of the world's healthiest recipes you will know it's not all about just eating low fat, it's about eating truly healthy foods, not just substitute lowfat x for regular x."
3,Not all I expected,"I was disappointed. Her completion times are OFF, way off. I've used about four recipes and two I will use again. Many sound good."
5,An Inspiring Look at the Life of Francis of Assisi,"Edward Hays has written an interesting account of the life of Francis that debunks the ""statue in the garden with a bird on his shoulder"" image that many people have of this saint who literally transformed the Catholic Church. The historical novel format results in an interesting and informative account of the legendary saint whose fidelity to the simple message of Jesus has attracted millions of followers over the centuries.Francis was a living lesson of what it means to follow Jesus, and Hays provides a vivid picture of the model for Franciscan living and his life journey to faithfully imitate Christ."
2,"Belkin Pop-up Shade - useful, convenient but fell apart within a week","Good design, effective. Excellent value. It significantly enhanced effectiveness of LED viewfinder UNTIL right side fold-out shade fell off and was lost WITHIN FIRST FEW DAYS OF USE. Better construction / quality control is badly needed."
2,Useful but fragile,"The pop-up shade is useful to keep light off the lcd screen but it's way too fragile for the price. This is a replacement for the same product that fell apart. The outer shade clips tend to chip off and springs on the hinges suddenly fall off. Good idea for a product, just not very durable. Look for the sales!"
5,great purchase,"I had one and I accidentally sat on it. oops! I found this online and purchased it, it keeps the glare off the screen. love it! it also protects your screen"
1,Not worth the money,"It says for three inch LCD systems, but it overlaps by about an eighth of an inch my three inch LCD. I tried using it on a sunny day and could not see the LCD. The sun shone from the side and caused the LCD to be as unusable as it is without the pop-up shade. I'm going to just pull it off and toss it."
2,Doesn't fit the Canon SD870IS well - slightly too wide,"The Canon SD870IS - when putting the 3.0 shade on, the shade is just that much too wide for the shade to stay on. I had a Canon SD550 and 2.5 shade fit perfectly, so I know what I'm talking about. The frame will stay on because it uses the heavy duty adhesive to secure it. When you try to then put on the shade itself, it comes off way too easily. If it fit, it would be PERFECT! The right side of the camera - the controls are at a slight enough upgrade that the shade will not stay on."
2,O.K. show me the $$$ . . .,". . . I bought this device because I hate digital cameras with no viewfinder! The reflection of my mug on the flat screen on the back of my Nikon Coolpix was aggravating to say the least. The fold-out/fold-up shade seemed to be the solution . . . the price was right . . . however, the snap-on part of the shade has a habit of ""popping off"" at in opportune times, and the ""shade"" doesn't really stop my reflection or even the stuff behind me from showing up on the viewing screen . . . don't waste your money on these things, instead buy a black cloth like Ansel Adams used, and drape it over your head (and camera) when outdoors . . ."
3,pop up shade,Added some width to my Canon SD870 making it harder to fit in the camera case. The reason I took it off the camera was I could not see the screen if I held the camera lower than eye level.
4,I love this but the shade slip&#8203;s off easily,I see this on my Panasonic Lumi9x TZ1. It makes a lot easier to see the display while shooting and reviewing. My only complaint is that sometimes the shade slips off the mount and I lose it. I solved this problem with Crazy Glue :-)
4,LCD Photo Shade,"Excellent to help in the sun and also protect the screen from scratches. It's a help, but not always totally beneficial in the sun. It's a device I've gotten for each of my cameras over the years."
3,USEFUL BUT FRAGILE,"I have used up four of these Delkin pop-up shades. They have been very useful, but the last time I found a supply I bought three of them since they break rather easily at the hinge. Especially useful since I don't have a eye-level viewfinder on my camera. So, a necessity on the beach or when the ground is covered with snow.Paul Schubert"
4,Pop Up Shade,Received product with missing parts. Returnedproduct for exchange but refused. Cost mePostage I was not too please about it. I stillgive 4 starts for the product. I have this producton my other camera. E
1,didn't work for me,I see the perfect score for this product and wanted to let everyone know that there is at least ONE person it didn't work for. im sure its great for everyone else though
5,Marezine,These worked pretty well. Went on a cruise- i could still feel the movement of the ship. We were headed north to Canada where the water can be rocky. But i did not get sick i took two per day. Thank You.
4,It worked!!!,"I have always suffered from motion sickness and always struggled in cruise ships. So when I was given the opportunity to cruise on a disney ship, I didn't want my kids to miss out because of me (and Disney is always fun). Surprisingly I was doing fine for the entire cruise but on the way back home (the last 2 days), I guess the ship was rocking a little more and I felt my usual motion sickness taking over. I took the Marezine and was a bit disappointed because I had high hopes that it would start working immediately. It took about 2 hours before it kicked in which is better than nothing but then again it made me drowsy. So to summarize, it works but will take a couple of hours to kick in and you'll have to fight off feeling drowsy. I kept yawning but was glad I was able to be around to see my kids enjoying all the disney activities!"
4,Good game for younger toddlers,"This game was a lot of fun for my 3 and 5 year old but they do get bored of it quickly so I would suggest for younger children, around 2-3."
5,"very cool for speech delayed 3 year old, great first game","This is a wonderful first game....Be sure to make lots of high affect funny faces and sound effests...oh no...I picked a monster! and then in an exaggerated way take the monster and throw it to the side of the room saying ""go away monster!!!!!!"" and laugh..and smile. Very good for speech delayed or autistic kids that really need to develop shared attention skills...fun!!!!"
5,Chasing Nightmares Away,"This game was a fun way to help our child overcome her night-time fears about monsters when she was 3 and 4. It was easy and fun to play, and helped her talk and laugh about the monsters she was imagining."
5,Takes the fear out of monsters,"The silliest, friendliest monsters inhabit the bedrooms of Go Away Monster! My daughter loves this game, and her friends enjoy playing it together. They cheer whenever a monster is selected and thrown into the monster pit (box). It's great for matching objects, sharing, turn-taking, and lets kids feel in control of any monster fears. Sometimes we let the monsters hide under the bed, or pretend they're part of the wall, but they're always discovered and sent back to the box."
5,Great entry game for very young kids!,"I learned about it on reading many reviews at boardgamegeek.com, which is the best resource for reliable reviews of board games for kids as well as adults. Sure enough, my 2.5 year old son loves this game! I suggest hamming it up w/ much fear/consternation at the appearance of a monster. This adds to the mystery & excitement upon drawing each piece from the bag."
2,For children under 4,"I bought this for my four year old son. There really is no 'game' to the game. We played it twice ( that took all of 9-10 minutes) and then I tried to think of some way to make it fun, or competitive, or interesting.If I had payed 4.99, it would have been O.K., but not ( with shipping) [item price]. Advertise for children under 4."
5,Great game for 3 yr olds,Three year old learned quickly and couldn't wait to play with the rest of the family. It did help at bedtime to get rid of monsters. Great concept. Would recommend.
4,Pretty Fun!!,"Our 3 year old loves this toy she got for Xmas and her daddy and I do too. It's fun, simple, allows for teamwork and kindness, and is silly too. Nothing sharp, complicated, and not millions of tiny bits and pieces. Just cardboard play pieces. We all love playing it and sometimes we change the words to make it funny to each other."
2,OK for really little ones,I would say this toy is fun for kids 3 and under...beyond that they get bored before the game is over. It's also hard for an adult to play with a child because it's way too easy to feel the pieces and figure out what to pull from the bag. You have to throw the game or win every time. That's no fun because I love to play games like Candyland with the kids because sometimes you win and sometimes you don't!
4,Great for 2-3 year olds,This game only takes 10 mins or so to play and is most suitable for 2-3 year olds. The older the kids the more likely they are to get bored after playing this game a couple of times.
4,Best first board game,"This is an awesome first board game for your toddler. Your child does not need to know how to count or read, he/she can learn a few vocabulary words but most important it helps your child learn to take turns, matching, follow instructions, and learn to play with others. My child is 3 and loves it. Very good for children in the autism spectrum."
4,"good, but not that good",THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL VIDEO COLLECTION. YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY DVD SPECIAL FEATURES OR UNSEEN FOOTAGE. BUY THIS ONLY IF YOU ARE A DIE-FOR CINDERELLA FAN
3,a great historical novel turned into a so-so book,"What I didn't like: Klinghoffer treats almost every Midrashic legend about Abraham as literal truth (rather than as parables created to make a broader theological or ethical point). But as Klinghoffer himself occasionally admits, these stories (a) were not necessarily meant to be taken literally and (b) occasionally contradict each other.What I liked: although I occasionally found this book loopy, I give it credit for being learned. Klinghoffer seems to have a pretty sure command of these stories, and has at least some awareness of modern archaeology (not that I know enough to intelligently judge)."
1,Nonsense!,This is a horribly written book. It vascillates between the Abraham story of the Torah and that of Midrash. I couldn't determine a timeline of Abraham's life as compiled in each of these sources. The result was confusing and incomprehensible.Don't waste your money.
4,A Pleasant Cup of Tea,"The album is good! If you enjoy Blue Note or Brazilian music then its more than worth the small price. Blue Note fans will particularly enjoy this album as the fusion of styles is well suited and executed.The album starts off in high spirits of the Samba then meanders through the Blue notes of Brazil, excellent for dinner parties or nights in.However the only point of caution would be to those of you who would be into hard core Brazilian Music, then this might not be your favorite cup of tea, all be it one to which you may wish to experience.Hope this helps."
2,Not as comfy as most clarks,"Shoe has a high back that kinda cuts in to your heel. I love Clark's, but not this pair!"
2,Misleading description,"Nowhere in the product description online did it say it wasn't for PORCELAIN tile, I had to find that out by reading the four point font on the back of the package once I got it. Not to mention naming a company Vermont American and having the product made in China..."
5,I use them for drill pressing stone underwater,"....and these by far accomplish what I need done at a very reasonable price. Each bit gets me between 10 and 20 drillings done, depending on the density of the stone. This is a good buy!"
1,DOES NOT LIVE UP TO IT'S NAME,"Contrary to what the other reviewer says about this DVD, DON'T buy it - you'll thank me.Yes, the girls in it are young and amateur, but there is precious little nudity to be seen. Only one of the girls takes her pants off for a few seconds, but she's shaved, and sits at such an angle that you can't see anything anyway!If fact, the girls spend most of their allotted posing time in underwear, and very little time top-less.Furthermore, the production value of this DVD is second to all. Poor lighting, dull camera work, no close-ups, and no nudity. Pathetic."
5,H A Y S T A K,"I've yet to listen to this whole CD. I just can't say enough for Stak. He has to be one of the, if not the, most talented rappers on today's scene. Stak tells it like it is. And in a way most white people can feel. He's way better than Feminem. 'Car Fulla White Boys' describes my crew almost to a T. I'm plannin on buyin' all his shiznit. Stak, keep it comin'. Much Love! PEACE!"
3,quite helpfull,"The book covers the classic areas of performance engine building. What differs it from other books is two things: 1. These guys have done theire homework. It is written by experienced enginebuilders, and they know what they are talking about. 2. they are clearly used to work on a budget. They don`t just pick out the most expensive bolt-on parts, but suggest several solutions for the builder who do not have the funds to buy such toys.Last, they are realistic. No nonsense about 700 HP, but several encouragements to keep it functional. All in all a book worth the money."
5,Tech book,Great info if you want to think about your next upgrade. It allows you to choose the best balanced combination.
4,small block ford book,I ordered this book to get more info on Explorer 5.0 engine parts to be used to improve an older Mustang 5.0. Not much in here to help me decide.
3,basic,"If your'er a novice engine builder looking for some info to get started this is for you. Spend a lot of time on emissions,a sign of the times. Good for understanding the camshaft and its terms.Very general overview of all ford v-8s."
1,Full of Distortions and Selective Omission of Facts,"De Zayas tries to convert Germans from aggressors to victims. He claims that few Silesians voted for the Nazi party (false), and repeats the baseless canard about 2 million Germans dying during the expulsion. He would have us forget that the vast majority of Germans of ALL types supported German imperialistic claims, and believed that Slavs were subhumans (untermenschen). Evidently, De Zayas apparently believes that Germans should be free to inflict suffering upon others without getting any of it in return."
2,WEAK WITH ONE EXCEPTION...,"THE CONCEPT IS EXTREMELY COOL, MANY BEATS ARE EXCEPTIONAL, BUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF KOOL KEITH, THE RHYMES ARE JUST PLAIN TERRIBLE. BREEZE, XHIBIT, HORROR CITY, AND THE REST JUST RUIN THE OTHERWISE BRILLIANT IDEA OF A MODERN RAP CONCEPT ALBUM. TOO BAD KEITH'S INSANE STYLE COULDN'T HAVE RUBBED OFF ON THE REST. BUT THANKS PAUL FOR THE ONE TRACK, IT'S THE BEST!"
3,Not a cd that i can vibe with,"the cd has a very interesting story, and the first time i listened to it, i was definetly into it. but the reason i only gave it 3 stars is because i believe that it has no playback value. i like to listen to the music of a cd, but this cd has so many interludes that i can't handle it. i would say the playback value of this cd is sauce."
4,Awesome Album!,This album is Hip-Hop at the top. It has concept and meaning. IT is not just a album of nothing. It is like getting a movie plus ill rhymes all in one package. For the listeners out there this is the way to go.
5,Aw yeeeeeeeeah boyee,"I luv it I luv it I luv it. Prince Paul's tracks have so much otherworldly flavour. Ekkspecially luv ""Steady Slobbin'"" and the ""The Other Line"". For those who don't know, Prince Paul produced De La Soul's ""3 feet high & rising"", the coolest piece of recorded noize in the known universe. I tried to review it but it wasn't listed under De La's albums. What's up with that Amazon people, sort it out. Anyway ""A Price Among Thieves"" is a concept album with lots of skits. A favourite when I'm blunted. Buh bye"
5,This album is the joint:,"What can I say? This original and hearing Chris Rock as acrackhead and Kane as a pimp is hilarious. Prince Paul is truly agenius, an intelligent and brilliant artist. END"
4,"Great imagination, you'll laugh, cry. . .","""A Prince. . ."" is one of the most original hip-hop CD's lately, with the exception of Handsome Boy Modeling School. Truly witty and original. Paul succeeds again."
5,This album is one of the nicest hip-hop albums recently out,"Prince Paul outdoes himself on this one. Not only does he recruit an allstar lineup of rhymers, but every track is flawlessly produced. The only thing somewhat annoying about this album is the constant skits in between songs, but the quality of the music tracks far outways this flaw."
5,The firstg true Hip-Hopera,"Prince Paul has finally done what others have tried to do failed. This album is completely focused. Prince Paul is the first producer to do a skit on an album. (see De La Soul 3 Feet...) Paul put together a hodge podge of rapper's delight's with Chubb Rock, Big Daddy Kane,& Everlast to name a few. Dope is the best definition for this album."
3,"good, but not classic","Much of the rhyming was great, though maybe between 10 and 20% of it was subpar. My other problem was with the dumb skits, which of course helped move the intentionally cliched story line along. But they served mostly to interrupt the flows built up in the rapping segments, thus stealing whatever momentum the album developed. If only they could've been a bit shorter...A really cool concept album though, and its jabs at the state of today's hip hop were much appreciated. If Prince Paul or some other producer could tweak the style a bit, perhaps a hiphopera could achieve ""classic"" status among hip hop records. Until then, we'll have to settle for this fine, but imperfect specimen. It's worth buying, but not worth cherishing."
5,Hip Hop is alive!!,"The character in this CD is what I like most of all, over the killer beats and featured artists like Everlast and Big Daddy Kane. The CD is a 70 min. action packed story, which goes from a life as a hustler, to getting busted, to being in jail (like the video), to the showdown. If you don't like this manifestation of hip hop you can take your words and eat 'em!"
2,Great Beats Undone By Weak Rhymes,"This album stands as proof that a great rap album needs more than just a great producer. Prince Paul lays down quite a few powerfully tight beats on the album, but the somewhat weak vocals and horrendous lyrics are sufficient ruin the album. Prince Paul deserves props for his effort and for the idea of crafting a so-called ""hip-hopera"", but, the next time, he should make sure he has, in the words of KRS-ONE, ""A mad crew that's of some benefit to you."""
3,"neat concept, unengaging story","I had high hopes for this album, and in concept it is really neat. But as much as I was hoping to love this album, I didn't. I find the story unengaging and a little shallow. The music never really grabbed me, and now the CD is collecting dust. Great idea, though, so I gave it 3 stars. Worth having purely for its historic value."
4,Well worth your money and time!,"This is something that should be done more in music. Prince did it with a couple of his CDs, most notably ""3 Chains of Gold"", but I have to say that Prince Paul creates more visceral images with his attempt.While ""A Prince Among Thieves"" soars storywise, it sort of stalls musically. I don't think the replay value of this disc is going to pan out. I've listened to it a few times in the few days I have it, but there are only three or four awesome songs in the set.All in all, I think this is a very good CD and a valiant creative effort. Everyone should enjoy this just for the story alone. I can't wait for the full-length video."
2,"not as good as the other ""Moods""",It was ok but very boring. The bagpipes get really old really fast. I'm just curious. Do the Scotish have any other type of music beside bagpipes. I worn you buyers that this almost all bagpipes.
5,best molding cream,"I've tried a lot of creams to manage my hair, but most leave it greasy or wet looking. This stuff does neither but provides and excellent hold and style management. It's a little pricy, but you don't need much."
3,A must have book for the beginner bridge player!,An excellent book for the novice. Extremely helpful. Very explanatory. Borrowed my friends copy and purchased my own for future reference. There's too much to remember in bridge and this book is a great refresher course & reference.
2,Kind of general...,"The book is the edited work of 26 writers, teachers and editors. The chapters are small, the details slim, the subjects bounce all over the place, and many of the rules and advice could be used by mystery or military writers. It was just too weak, telling me nothing that I couldn't guess at. If you want a solid piece of work about sci-fi/fantasy get the how-to-write books by Orson Scott Card. If you want just fantasy there are world building books by Gary Gygax. And if you want to learn about horror go to Stephen King. Go with the books that have the vision of one author, from the first page to the last."
2,"A messy collage, dated and with not much of use","My guess is that the editor (or possibly the publisher) had the idea for this book and then asked a lot of F/SF/horror writers to write ""something"" for it. Only a few of the authors appear to actually have anything to say about writing. Many reminisce about their own first sales, way back in the day. In some cases they give examples of their own work that, by today's standards, seem embarrassingly bad. (Tastes change.) But anyway, this golden-age advice was probably outdated even when the book was first published in 1987.There may be a few tidbits here for the inexperienced writer who hasn't already read them elsewhere or figured them out for him/herself. But it's a lot of slogging to find them."
2,More for the fantasy/horror writer than the SF writer,"Science fiction gets the short shrift in this treatment, and the essays that do address science fiction in particular are too superficial. The tone of the other essays I read before returning the book is more self-congratulatory than helpful."
3,MEDIOCRE ANTHOLOGY,"This book suffers from the same problem most how-to-write books have: It doesnt teach you much in the way of how to improve your writing or much about the philosophy of fear. It doesnt provide a target or the means to hit a bulls-eye.I've said this before: Editors buy what they personally like OR they buy from writers with a proven track record (regardless of how they feel about it). People know what they like AND you cant argue with success.And the editor felt compelled to include a whining feminist who lectures writers about sexist stereotypes, etc. I have no idea why NOW doesnt screen every story and book and attach their union label to the writing they approve. My guess is they just like to whine.The bottomline is: This effort is pretty much like every other impotent and flaccid how to write manual."
4,Rattlesnake Shaker,"Peter Green looked oh so uncomfortable throughout this video of mostly Milli Vanilli Mac performances from early European TV shows. One wonderful exception is the band's appearance on Hugh Heffner's ""Playboy At Night"" TV show. Heff makes incredibly vacuous ""conversation"" with someone at the mansion while segueing into an intro of the band. The camera pans to the Mac surrounded by Bunnies, Peter Green in his ""Jesus"" attire, grinning from ear to ear as they launch into...""Rattlesnake Shake""! Early reality TV! Surreal!This is definitely for Peter Green Mac fans. I can't imagine casual viewers enjoying much of this. But, I'm a fan and I did despite the lip-synching and brevity of the entire product."
2,A disappointment,"Of the fifteen songs only four are live, the rest lip-synchs.Not much history or interviewseither."
1,lip synched mac attack,"i cannot imagine any Peter Green fan liking this. It should have been called ""Why Peter Green quit the music biz"". The performances are mostly lip-synched. A complete rip-off."
4,another typical Sweet Valley Book,"New girl Brooke Dennis is horrible. She's mean to twin sisters Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield. She hates their friends for no reason, and is rude to the twin's parents.One day Jessica and her friends decide to pull a major prank on Brooke involving a made up triplet sister, and a broken chair.When Elizabeth learns the truth about Brooke, she knows she has to stop the prank before it's too late.``Katrina"
5,A Impossible New Girl,"When A New Girl named Brooke Dennis moves to Sweet Valley,She is snobbish.She says she likes classical music,She kicks Sally,the dog Jessica is babysitting for Mrs.Bramble,and is mean to everyone in Sweet Valley Middle School,So the twins devise a plan to get even with her,a imaginary triplet named ""Jennifer"" Who wears a bow and talks in a whisper. It works and Brooke is nice to Jennifer,but Jennifer understands the reason why she is so mean,her mother and father are divorced.She can't stay with her mother,so she stays with her filmaking father.Meanwhile,Jerry McAlister[the meanest kid in SVMS] is planning a trick on Brooke at an assembly,a collapsable chair. Elizabeth,tries to warn her,but it is too late.It is her birthday,and the kids make it up to her by giving her a birthday party."
2,not a bad book,"Sweet Valley Twins is always a teaching tool,this one especially tells people to give others a chance,and to be sensitive ESPECIALLY when you dont know about that person.Brooke is at Sweet Valley Middle School for the first time,and she acts like an awful snob.But she is really unhappy as it turns out."
2,Good looking but not durable...where is the swiss quality?,"Bought thsese because wanted a slick and light-weight bag for my suntan lotions and other cosmetics. Took it with me on a 7- day trip and there are first signs of damage - white and puffy spots (dryied? absorbed lotion?) on its inner part, and a couple of drops of suntan lotion made the inner part got black, where the zipper is, this black spot is also visible right now from outside, it looks like the black ribbon which is attached to the zipper is not colorfast and stained red mesh...I really love the brand...and therefore harder I feel my dissatisfaction, a cheap plastic would perform better, paying over $30 per 2 bags that will probably not last than a couple of trips just does not make sense to me."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I realize that I made assumptions, based on other reviews, that this publication might run me through the process of carving a stock from a block of wood, and in particular, checkering - it doesn't. The writer assumes that you have a gunstock that you'd like to carve Deer or Elephants into with an Exacto blade, and only mentions checkering as an aside, as in (not a quote!), your stock may or may not have checkering on it - I wanted to throw it against the wall. The patterns may be useful to those interested in carving them, and the carving exercises could prove helpful to anyone new to working a blade on wood. Live and learn"
5,Good Read,This is a great read and offers incite into the art. I often look back in the book to find the tips and tricks of the trade and technics given by the author.
3,Gunstock,A good book with easy to understand information and drawings. The book covers all levels and it does offer something for every one.
3,Outdated but Good,"This is a great publication, however it is outdated by todays standards, of using air drills for gun stock carvings. The patterns are a great asset."
3,Buyer Beware,"I've been a big fan of Farberware products for forty+ years. This pan is my first disappointment. The pan is very good quality and performs very well. The problem lies in the design of the handle; unwieldy at best, but also potentially dangerous to the user. The diameter is way too small. Perhaps comfortable for dainty little hands, but useless in hefting an eight pound skillet. Further, the shape is nearly cylindrical and the finish perfectly smooth. When you try to lift the pan with anything in it, the pan wants to flip over. Even when washing it in the sink, it just wants to flip over. To be honest, it does have a handle on the front of the pan (not shown in the Amazon AD) but this is only helpful for carrying the pan to the table or somewhere. It is useless when cooking or trying to pour off juices. Be very afraid of that handle."
4,Unplugged tune with a bonus track,"Though this song's chart performance hasn't been brilliant in England (#18), it's still quite a good song. Probably not quite as good as the likes of ""So Young"" and ""What Can I Do"", but it has a wonderful orchestral beauty and a top sing-a-long chorus. So all in all a pretty good single. It also comes with the Unplugged version of ""Dreams"", which isn't on most of the MTV Unplugged albums."
2,"Worked Great, For 10 months....","After doing the yoga positions to get this into place it worked fine and fit perfectly. However, here I am 10 months later looking to replace the exact same part again and really not looking forward to stuffing myself under the passanger dashboard again.... I'll be buying a different brand part this time in the hopes that it will last at least a year."
2,Made in China,"Although the picture shows a box that reads: EAU DE COLOGNE, I received a bottle that had a sticker on the bottom that read: EAU DE TOILETTE, MADE IN CHINA, FRAGRANCE MADE IN USA. The cologne is darker in color than my previous purchases and the scent is just not the same."
2,Smelly,"This is an old, overly strong fragrance my mother used to wear in the 1950's. She asked for it for Christmas this year. It is as awful as I remember."
4,I've been using this fragrance for over 40 years.,I am very familiar with Toujours Moi as I have been wearing it for over forty years. It is perfect for me and everyone seems to identify me by the fragrance... Love it!
5,Amazon a big help,"I own a small business in the mountains of Colorado. I needed a specific cable for my key card machine and thought it would be easy to find at Radio Shack or Office Depot. However, neither had the cable I needed, nor could they order it. Office Depot was very helpful in doing some research and providing me with specific info. and suggested I try Amazon.com. It worked. The arrival of the cables was a bit slow, but it was a perfect fit."
5,"Adorable, and attaches to just about anything.","This diaper pack is well made, and holds 3 diapers, wipes, and a disposable changing pad. I attach it to whatever bag I am carrying including the Buggy Bagg. I get lots of compliments on this bag, and will probably buy another."
4,gritty down home blues,"What a voice! Coupled with original lyrics and backed by a strong band, Leo LaDell is an unsung talent. We need more of Leo."
5,Excellent!!!,"Since I love almost all of Ms. McCoy's books, I guess I'm a little biased. However, I found this book to be very informative and gave me a lot of ideas for the Esbats. I highly recommend it. Bright Blessings to all!!! :)"
3,GENERIC,"I bought the book to change axle and struts on mazda 3 but the pictures and directions were kinda vague to me. It didn't tell me that there might be difference in axles from certain yr models, car made nov 2004 is different then cars made in jan 2005 even there 2005 models. So its o.k. to use to get an idea on how to do some repairs but you may have to figure out how to get from point a to c without b"
4,This book was pretty good...,"I enjoyed this book even though it was a little bit below my age level. It helped me to work my brain and think to figure out the answers of the clues on almost every page. I would recommend this book to everyone from age 7 to age 11,"
2,Meh,"I bought this based on a single song I had by Ann-Margret on a Christmas Compilation album. That song was great, sexy and witty and festive. Alas, this album is a real let down. It's just all treacly goo. If you like overly sentimental Christmas music you'll like it."
5,Comprehensive Reference,"A reference book in coffee table format. Large format with lots of pictures (although many are B&W) of anything that has been called a ""lifeboat"", and the history of them all and how they were developed and used. But don't expect that you can read it in one sitting (or week). It covers all of recorded history and brings over 200 other sources and ten years of research together into one place. If you're interested in the topic, get this book."
4,Almost Perfect!,"This tycoon game was almost perfect. In my opinion it is a upgrade of playing the board game. You get to lease and auction property from the city and build stores, apartments and make money. Time goes by really fast in years and you see a little as far as the cars and the other way to tell is by the different type of stores available to open. Once in a while they give you a card and you either have to pay something or get money, similar to the board game. I really enjoyed it but I wish you can move on to the next level with what you have built instead of starting all over again at the new/next level. If it wasn't for that I would have graded it a 5."
4,A nice twist to Monopoly,"Great game...im a fanatic of the tycoon computer games...i find them to be very entertaining and they are a great way to pass the time....and real fast!!!....Monopoly Tycoon is a good game...you can go for bronze, silver, and gold trophies for each scenario...It has a very good tutorial within the game...it takes you through all of the features and you're ready to go once you go through the whole tutorial...The first couple of scenarios are very short, but they serve to take you through the first steps so that you can get the hang of it...Later on you play against up to 4 players, and it becomes harder but more exciting...the year doesnt end either...i had to go up to the year 2085 to win one time...so its great...the music is good too...You get to create the store you want, set it at the price you want, build apartments, hotels, etc. Every couple of years more stores become unlocked and available for you to build...An overall good game!"
4,Rucker the Millionaire,"This game was fun and exciting, it gave me the change to apply some of the things I was learning in ECON to real life, it also had an competitive aspect were you compete with the computer and its actaully a challenge!!! Played this game for hours while listening to Personal development, great game.-Rucker the MillionaireMan of God"
2,Fun with exception,"Imagine the Monopoly board as a city. Each color is a city block with people walking around. You want to build retail stores, apartments and hotels to attract people to your block(s).I really like this game. I find myself wanting to play it often but it is more for online play, its really limited for single player mode. Once you play through the AI challenges to unlock the freeplay/sandbox mode it takes away the AI computer players and you play all by yourself! This is a drag. No one to compete with, no one in the entire city but you, building away all by yourself. Online play of course replaces the AI players with actual people but I do not play online and I am disappointed in games that charge the same price but put all the fun in the online mode.I like the game and wish I could play it more but get bored playing alone.So it is 3 star fun but overall 2 star for no replay value.However if you like online and enjoy competing to be the richest cat in town this game is for you."
1,WOW!!!,"I had this game like 9 years ago, I Loved It!! But, when I got this game, popped it into my pc and lappy, its not compatiable with either system. Im running a windows xp. Keeps saying mc1.0 is the version of the game, and im running mc1.5! What in the world is that???? I tell all of you that sells pc games, PLEASE check what versions they are supported on, and make sure that the buyer knows before it gets shipped off to them!!! (The Casino game that came with the Tycoon game works lovely!!!)"
4,Great!!!,"This game is really fun. Although its not like monopoly, they do a good job of adapting a tycoon game with monopoly."
1,monopyl tycon,"i thought the service getting the product was excellent, just did not like the game, it was not what i was expecting it to be."
2,"a bit dull, not enough photos",This reminds me of a textbook you'd have in college - nowhere near as good as Ken Burn's Civil War book
4,Nice and easy,"This book offers a view of relationships and how to handle difficulties in them. The author goes a little bit into the differences between men and women. She offers a way for women to make changes in their lives for better even when their men are not on the same page yet. It is very encouraging and helpful. It lightens one's spirit and gives hope for a better life and better relationships, and more love."
3,NOT SURE I GET IT,"ALTHOUGH THOUGHT PROVOKING, I THINK? IT LEFT ME A LITTLE - WELL CONFUSED, DO I WIN, DO I LOSE, DO I HAVE A CHOICE, A BIT OXIMORONISH (IF SUCH A WORD EXISTS), OH THAT'S RIGHT, THIS IS MY MOVIE, IT EXISTS THEN, ANYWAY, WITH WHAT SEEMED TO BE DESTINY SECURED, OR NOT SECURED, AND I'M STILL WONDERING ABOUT THE LIPSTICK THING - AND I'M UNCLEAR AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I GET OUT OF HERE OKAY OR NOT OKAY, OR IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER, BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT ANYWAY, LEARN OR NOT LEARN, LEARN BECAUSE I HAVE TO, LEARN TO LEARN BECAUSE I MUST OR, MY BIG QUESTION IS WHAT, WHAT, IS THIS BOOK SAYING - NOT SURE, NOT CLEAR, JUST DON'T KNOW, HMM! IT'S A PASS AROUND BOOK AND THEN - OTHER PEOPLE CAN TELL ME ABOUT LEARNING, AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE, PERHAPS - AN EXPLANATION OF THE BOOK - I GUESS IT DID MAKE ME THINK, THINK IN CIRCLES, THINK WHAT POSSESSED ME TO BUY THIS BOOK - AGAIN MYADJECTIVE HMM!"
5,Careers with Horses,"This book really is comprehensive. Packed full of everything and a little heavy, it leaves nothing out. The book was in excellent condition from the seller. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Great Condition,Just wanted to say that I received my book and it was in great condition. I also got the package fairly quickly. Thank you.
1,Wrong CD arrived,"I ordered an instrumental Christmas music CD. What arrived was the correct CD case, but the wrong CD. It was the soundtrack to Sleepless in Seattle. Great movie, but not the CD I ordered. When I called Amazon's customer service, I found out the call center was in the Philippines. The language barrier was a bit of a problem, as I couldn't seem to convey to the representatives that what arrived was a movie soundtrack in the Christmas music case. I am disappointed, as I've never had a problem with any other item bought on Amazon."
5,National Park Mysteries,I really love this mystery series. They always take place at a national park and provides enough history and geography to be educational yet be included in the book as to not be preachy. Kids love the varied plots that come from being in different parts of the country as well as learn about different points of view. This book in particular pointed out the split between people who wanted to have wild wolves in the park as a natural predator and those who were ranchers who feared for their livestock. The book has a lot of suspence and yet is not too long. Great for early chapter book readers.
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,I'm all about simplifying my cables. The less the better! This cable is perfect for my dual monitor setup.Update 2/2/2013: Seven months still working great.
3,Mike Manley--the secret master,"Manley is the best kept secret in the comics world. He is capable of drawing anything--in any style--beautifully. But he is dependent on routine comics work to make a living and it is always rush job stuff. Never anything where one can put time and love into it.SO he has has own magazine. Here you can see the secret master at work--uh, behind the scenes, as editor. Once again, we don't get to see Manley unleashed. A few glimpses, yes.GET this zine collection just to see Manley's work! That's my advice!"
2,"Worked well for two years, then the control melted.","I got this for my mom, and in it's defense, I must say older people tend to leave their electric blankets on 'high' all night, (probably not a good thing for them OR the blanket), as they have less circulation in their legs. But anyway, after two years, the on/off temperature control literally melted out of shape. It didn't start a fire or anything, but the plastic warped. I'd be extra careful with these, and all, electric blankets."
4,Great quality and price,"The picture and audio quality of the episodes on here is very good. The only bad thing is the episodes don't contain the original theme music. However, they contain an instrumental version of ""The Ballad of Jed Clampett"". If it weren't for the theme, I would have given it 5 stars"
5,Fun family game,I was looking for a game we could play as a family. Something for ages 5 to 90. I heard about a version of this game called Killer Bunnies that is really fun so I thought we would give this one a try first. The five year old has to have help but loves it. It is a fun game for family game time.
4,Fun game for the whole family!,"I bought this game on a whim from the local game store (sorry, sometimes I do buy local). I heard Killer Bunnies was a fun game, but I wanted something my whole family could enjoy. Kinder Bunnies fits the bill PERFECTLY. Well, my 7yo and 4yo LOVE this game. They are always asking to play it. While the 4yo cannot read, he definitely understands how to play, and how to wreak havoc on dear ol' dad. THe 7yo firmly gets the concepts and is starting to understand some of the strategy.My wife and I also enjoy playing. It's nice the game comes with a ""basic"" game, and a more advanced deck that you can add as you get comfortable with the mechanics. This is a VERY fun card game with some very cool dice mechanics."
1,Bad sound,"There are other versions of these amazing sides out there, with better sound. These sound like they were taken directly from an old LP. The surface noise is always there. Also, seems that they click the stop button before many of the tracks finished. I am happy with most of the Definitive releases, but this one fails the test."
4,Another solid Killarmy album,"I almost gave this album 5 stars, 4.5 is more accurate. Fans of Killarmy who bought ""Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars"" and ""Dirty Weaponry"" (two great records) will find that this is also a Wu classic, maybe the best Killarmy album to date. All the lyricists (Killa Sin, PR Terrorist, 9th Prince, Shogun Assassin, Beretta 9, Islord) have definitely matured into superior rappers. Once again, 4th Disciple keeps the production tight, and with an executive producer like RZA, it is tough to find a flaw in this album."
2,Too Small!,"I ordered these because I thought they would be more convenient than the loose foam plugs I have been using. However, they are designed for someone with a medium/small head. The directions say to put them under your chin - ha! no way the plugs even came close to my ears. I tried putting behind my neck and was able to insert the plugs, but it was so tight around my neck that the rearward pull on the plugs became quite uncomfortable. I will say that they are easy to insert and do dampen sound quite well. But if you have a large noggin look elsewhere."
2,Not worth it,I got this to advance my brewing but it had no new info. Can be good for a beginner but the title is a little miss leading.
2,Rodney is obsessed with gum disease,"As a former patient of Dr. Katayama, I can vouch for his obsession with gum disease. Interestingly, he seems to be able to find gum disease even in perfectly healthy patients. Could it possibly be because it is so lucretive to his practice to schedule thousands of dollars in unnecessary follow up visits? His book seems to undercut his business practices, so I am wagering that he secretly hopes none of his patients will get wind of it. Well written, but get a life Rodney. Just because you're paranoid about gums--or just a money grubber--doesn't mean that the whole world is infected with dental diseases."
4,"Works, has a long life, but has some problems","The review made me say ""how fun this game was""......weirdAnyway, it works well, and has a very long battery life.Two problems:1.) Doesn't fit in the controller well (get's stuck)2.) When charged using a play and charge kit while playing it get's hot. Like really hot. Like, ""I'm kind of scared now"" hot. This shouldn't be a problem because you'll notice it getting hot while you're playing, but one time I left my controller on and plugged in to go to the dining hall and when I got back it was almost hot enough to burn me."
2,Worked...Kinda,"I bought one last year. It just stopped charging a couple of weeks ago. The original Microsoft battery pack that I had lasted several years. So, the product works, but doesn't last as long as the Microsoft power packs. I guess the Nyko power pack is worth the money considering that it's now at lest 20$ for white Microsoft brand battery packs. I'm just disappointed that I already have to invest in another one.But no matter what, it definitely beats using AA's that shortly end up in the trash."
5,"So far, so good.","I bought the battery about a week ago and I have to say that I think I got a great deal. As of now, I am still running off the first charge I gave it and it still reads a full 4 bars on the XBOX dashboard. Granted I don't use it 6 hours a day or anything, but so far it hasn't given me any issues at all. As for the other reveiws that say it is a bit hard to fit into the controller, I have to somewhat agree. It was a slightly tight fit, but who cares? So it takes me 5 seconds to insert the battery instead of the usual 4 seconds, I hardly change batteries on the controller anyway so to me it is not an issue. And as for long term use, I will have to wait and see on that topic, but so far this has ben a great buy for me."
1,Wouldn't recommend it,"Bought it as a spare to always have one battery ready to play while charging the 2nd one. I charged it twice without any problems with myXbox 360 Quick Charge Kitand on the third time I noticed the lights on the charging Kit wouldn't turn on, as in there wasn't any battery in it. Left it overnight without the charging kit lights on but just as I suspected it didn't charge one bit. I've googled a lot trying to find a solution but haven't found one. What I did find was that other customers have the same charging problem. Very dissapointed.EDIT: Forgot to mention, I also experienced what other reviewers have written. This battery is a bit larger than the original microsoft one and it has to be forced a little bit into the controller. I didn't pay much attention to this the two times I used it because I was happy that it was working properly. Have read in other pages that in time it can actually break the controller so also take this into consideration before buying this product."
5,A FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHORS,"Incredibly, this is still one of the most successful motif books available - it has sold nearly 50,000 copies worldwide.

Also don't miss regular features on us on HGTV in the United States."
1,Princess Leia and Jabba the Hutt do Spain,"I was really looking forward to watching this series after having my interest in Spain piqued by Jose Andres, however, we had to turn it off three quarters of the way through the first DVD (1 of 4). Mario Batali is awfully difficult to watch, he has the personality of a goofy 14 year old. The Spanish girl has a wonderful spirit which is constantly nipped at by Bittman, a jaded New Yorker along for the ride. I can only assume that Gwinneth politely agreed to follow through on her obligation."
1,Awful...,"As background, I love travel and food shows, and I love Mark Bittman (I own several of his cookbooks), but this show is very, very boring and I've never been able to finish watching even a whole single episode! They zip through the beautiful countryside in their convertible (who cares about their stupid car--show us some scenery!), don't really present much information about the food and basically, it's all about them instead of the country or the food. I actually hate this show and its traveling egotists and their inane conversations! If you are truly interested in authentic Spain and its food, watch and/or buy Jose Andres' book/DVD ""Made in Spain"" as it beautifully presents the country's beauty, its people and its wonderful cuisine!"
2,A huge letdown,"I had such high hopes for this series. The ingredients looked wonderful. I've really liked previous TV work by Batali and Bittman. Spain is one of my all-time favorite destinations, so I even bought a new DVR just so that I could catch every episode when it ran on PBS. Well, the DVR came in handy as I ended up doing some fast-forwarding once I got used to the episode structure. Holy cow it was dull! The banter between the four was irritating and appeared forced. I guess Mercedes Benz expected a lot of camera time, having provided a couple of high end cars for the show. We ended up with extended shots of the cars being driven around Spain at really slow speeds.Anthony Bourdain is the king of food travel TV, and if you caught his Spain episode, you will get far more out of his one hour show than you will get out of the 13 hours of this hugely disappointing durge."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"First of all, I've never written an Amazon review, and I just had to because this is my favorite ""documentary"" of all time. Granted, not all of you may enjoy food, wine, history and travel to the extent I do, but if you do, then you will really enjoy this DVD. Sure the 1 star guy has some valid points, but this is just supposed to be an enjoyable ""Road Trip"" through Spain in the yes of these 4 great, interesting and laughable people. Don't take anything too seriously and you will enjoy yourself. Although some of the restaurants they went to were ""world-class"", the focus is not the restaurant, but the food, wine, land and good company.All in all I wish there were another 11 DVD's to watch. It's really a nice way to rewind on a Fri movie night.Bravo Mario for putting this together. It's really a treat. (I'd start watching the weight, we don't want you to go the way of Chris Farley.)"
2,Spain on the road again book and cd set from TV show,"Not much in the book, a few recipes and a little dialog. Redundant to the TV series. CD,s were good but Mario and group seemed to miss the whole Spanish mentality which is eating as a social occasion and shouldn't be rushed. They ate fast like typical Americans and treated tapas like fast food."
2,Not for all cats,"I'm still getting to know my cats, but in three months they have happily eaten everything that I have put in front of them. Chicken, salmon, trout, herring, duck, turkey, quail, beef - and so on. One of the cats took a couple of bites and gave me a dirty look - the food sat there. The other one, who I call my little piglet, ate a third of it and walked off. Several hours later I pitched it all.Glad some like it, I liked the variation in protein source, but it does smell very rich and my cats prefer anything else."
2,"OK for students, not for the real world","I bought this book thinking it would be a practical tool for writing dynamic, engaging web copy... but it wasn't. It was too theoretical and had a boring textbook feel to it. I wanted to learn how users interact with the web and web text, but this book only told me broad generalizations that anyone who uses the web frequently already knows. Even though it's updated (""third edition"") much of felt way out of date."
4,Text book,I was pleased with my book however I didn't know that it was being shipped from the UK which added to the delivery time
5,Worked as Promised,I needed to add a couple of monitors to my desk for work flow requirements and after buying and installing this product I was very happy that it was so easy to install and configure. That's not always the case in the computer field. Good product and does just what it promises.
2,Dual Monitors,Will not work with an HP docking station. Can't find any support. Looks like it was a waste of money.
2,Beware of Widescreen Monitors,"The website compatibility check showed my equipment to be acceptable for this hardware application. The split screen functionality works great, but the resolution is very poor no matter what settings are selected. Beware of this product if your monitors are 16:9 format.Configuring the device is tiresome."
3,Blood and Splendor,"The book is very well written and entertaining. I recommend it for someone who wants an easy introduction to the topic at hand.However, I can't take it completely seriously. There are no sources detailed for the information the author has gathered. There are no footnotes for the quotes used, there are no corroborating documents listed. Much of the analysis given seems to be the author's opinions about the people, including their mental states, motives, values, and reasons for particular actions, rather than an actual factual analysis based on what can be proven. I would not recommend that any of the information in this book be used for research papers, etc., unless it is corroborated elsewhere. Too much seems to be imagined as opposed to discovered."
1,Don't buy this computer,problems with the wireless card - often it doesn't work - i.e. the computer can't recognize that it is present!Hard to figure out if all of the problems are because of Vista or Sony...Service Pack for vista completely messes everything upthe keyboard is very loud!the jack for headphones doesn't always work properlythe Vaio service module shuts down often - i.e. 2-3x per week - which makes it impossible to dim the background light intensityCustomer service always has a simple solution - erase the hard drive and start over!
5,Day 1: Much better than expected!,"I have to say this product is working wonders for me. I've been smoking since I was a teen and I'm in my early 30's now. I read a lot of reviews that said their first week was hell and that made me a little scared, so far I'm doing OK. I put on my first patch in the morning and I have been feeling good all day. I have to admit it is a little itchy be careful where you put them! I tried my tummy because i wasn't wearing sleeves but it was unbearable so I switched to my upper arm area. No sudden urges to smoke, only the occasional thought. I have identified my triggers (mainly after i eat) and instead of reaching for a smoke I grab some fruity gum and that has been working. It feel wonderful not to smoke! Words can't describe it. I even walked into the house when someone was smoking and kept going, knowing I could have easily bummed a smoke from them. Hope the rest of my days are this easy! Thank you NicoDerm!"
2,quitting,it seems to be working. I am now three weekswithout smoking after smoking two packs per dayI just hope after step three I don;t go backt
1,Buyer Beware!,"Received item on time, however, a week into the program discovered numerous empty patch packages and it seems that some of the patches have no ingredient content. Could these be seconds or knockoffs? Not sure, but they're ineffective at curbing nicotine craving and of course, many of the patch packs have no patches in them. Buyer beware, might be one product you want to purchase at the neighborhood store."
5,This will work,"Like all patches, it just itches. However these seem to hold up better than generic brands, I like the clear."
3,this one was abit off.,"As a whole the first part of this gundam trinity was worth the purchase, however this one in particular arrived with a broken dislodged disk from it's holder unlike the other two forcing me to track down another copy from a nearby video story to replace it as it did not work, overall I thank the seller for his services but i had to take points of this one as it was obvious the disk was dislodged when i took it out of the package cause i hear one of the dvd's inside moving."
2,Not for UC fans.,"Each to their own, but this series is not for fans of anything Universal Century. Pure pretty boy fluff. Not surprising since the target audience for this series in Japan is teenage girls. The mecha designs are nice though!"
1,don't buy it,"it's not the money spent on it, it comes with very little intructions, you have to fight to get it out of the package."
5,Bicycle Tri-Peak Solitaire,I enjoy playing Tri-Peak Solitaire. Love touch screen games. It's like Golf Solitaire. Great game! Great price! I recommend this game. HELGA
4,Solitaire Fun,Works very well and is lots of fun. Seems harder to beat game than my old electronic game.
