4,white board,"This, so far, is a great little place for my 32 month old daughter to play. The dry erase and magnetic side is so much fun for sticking magnet ABC. And writing them with the marker as well.we love this little thing. i initially wanted something bigger, but could not find the white board/magnet combo in anything else that satisfied me. I would still prefer for this to be a little bigger. And its pretty light weight. Good cuz my daughter can move it to another area to play, but bad cuz it has to be against something to prevent it from sliding around while she plays."
2,Not As Expected,"The vast majority of the homeschoolers interviewed were fundamentalist Christians using pre-planned curriculum and often rigid scheduling. This was certainly not, by any stretch of the imagination, an example of the rich variety of choices to be found within the homeschool world. There were also some rather pathetic innaccuracies within the text describing the Jewish family. Just one example is the word ""sabbath"" capitalized as ""Sabbath"" (for this family, ""sabbath"" would be a common noun) while the word ""Shabbat"" is not capitalized (Shabbat is the Jewish sabbath.) I wonder if the families represented were even given an opportunity to check the author's representations of their lives. If you want to read this book, buy a cheap used copy."
4,"Not a MUST buy, but still a good read ...","I really enjoyed reading about other families from different backgrounds and how they make homeschooling work for them. While the families did not give a lot of information on the curriculum they used, they did share information on why they homeschool and how they feel about structure and socialization. This is a book I would share with someone considering homeschool but were worried about making it work into their lifestyle. Though not a book I would reach to continually for advice, I did learn some tips and tricks while reading that I have implented into our own homeschool routine. If you see it at the library and you have time to fit in an extra read, I would recommend this book."

4,Just an ok down comforter,"I got this down comforter a few days ago. It is much thinner than what I expected. The tag says minimum 75% down, which is not good enough . But for this price, I can not complain more."
2,Very poor quality,"I actually ordered the National Sleep Products Luxury Down but was sent a Pacific Coast down comforter instead without explanation. It was entirely too thin, with large areas that were completely empty,no feathers, no type of fill at all. Not acceptable."
1,Don't do it save your money,I was sent a pacific coast brand comforter filled with about three feathers in it.Don't waste your money you'll just end up paying extra to return it.
4,Not bad for $29.99,"This was not a big giant fluffy down comforter, but definately MORE than adequate for California weather. It fit my Pottery Barn Duvet PERFECTLY. I am more than pleased with this. You get more than good value for your dollar. Thanks Co Pilot!! :)"
4,Different!,"This olive tapenade was very different, and very good! It is quite strong, so you will need to mix it with cream cheese or sour cream for a dip or something, but goes well on pasta or over grilled chicken. Will buy again!"
2,Didn't like it,"In my opinion, this type of olive isn't good for an olive spread. Of course, I had no way of knowing that until I bought it and tried it. For this reason, I don't recommend it."
4,Great game since 2001.,"DF:BHD is the game that I still play with action amazement. The Platinum pack gives new online gamers the pleasure to reach the next step in their online gaming hobby. I did not buy DF:BHD Platinum for myself but as a ""Thank you gift"" for a friend of mine at work. I introduced him to online gaming and BHD and he loves-it. For $15 plus S&H you cannot beat this great game and the hours you will have shooting other online opponents. These games are good for active or retired Armed Forces personnel. Try-it you won't be sorry. *****"
2,I love Clavell; I do not like this book,"If you are doing the ""Asian Sage,"" consider skipping this one. I loved Shogun and Tai-Pain, but this book captures none of the magic and it isn't important that you read it in order to be fully aware of what is going on in King Rat or Nobel House"
3,It's ok,"I continued to read through this tomb but found it difficult to be strongly pulled to read more. The characters didn't seem strong enough, or the strong ones were not brought forward stronger yet and the weak were to prominent."
3,gai-jin,"Not so good. Shogun was one of my all time favorite books, but this book was disappointing. The book started out well but I am now about half way through and I'm having trouble trying to finish. The story seems to ramble and is sometimes incoherent. I understand that Mr. Clavelle was in decline due to a serious illness, and I imagine it was difficult for him to write this book."
4,"""Gai-Jin"" worth the effort","Lots of negative comments are listed here regarding ""Gai-Jin"", which is in equal parts sequel to Clavell's ""Shogun"" and ""Tai-Pan."" Indeed, I'd strongly recommend reading both of those novels before tackling ""Gai-Jin,"" which builds tremendously on the characters and histories established in those works. All I want to say is this: I don't read Clavell for historical accuracy, nor am I offended by his supposed racist portrayals of Asian characters. This book, like all of Clavell's others, breaths tremendous life and will suck you into its many-layered web if you give it a chance. It's intense, so funny, so wonderfully dense, lots of action and intrigue, immensely informative, and oh so insightful into the cultural war of 1860's Japan. If it's less than historically accurate, I could care less --- this is a huge novel, a great story, a wonderful read. Pick it up, treasure it, give it a chance."
2,Disappointing,"Written competently enough, and the historical detail is impressive, but Clavell's unfortunate focus on melodrama produces characters impossible to credit. In this book, he particularly kills off characters just as their relationships are developing some momentum, preventing any depth of emotion, personality, or drama. I agree with the earlier reviewer who said that the first half was better than the second. This was not an enjoyable book, overall, far too long to produce so little resolution to its multiple plot lines. I can only think Clavell was straining to set up the sequel, and due to his death, we are only left with a disappointing failure as his epitaph."
5,Gai-Hin,"Excellent book, could not put it down, decided to buy all Tai Pan's stories by the same author Reading it in my kindle was fantastic. Historic novels at the best. Now reading Nobel House which is also very very good."
3,not a very good copy of this book,"Very small print, covers not very substantial. As far as the book itself, certainly not as good as his other books."
2,Not typical of Clavell's quality,"I'm a big fan of Clavell and looked forward to reading Gai-jin, but was pretty disappointed. I highly recommend his other books like Noble House, Taipan, Hawaii, Alaska, and King Rat. Pass on this one unless you have time to kill or lower your expectations."
2,Too many characters makes it cumbersome,"There were far too many characters in this book for me to keep track of, especially Japanese characters. If the author has to make a list of characters so that you can keep them straight (which he did), there are too many. I stuck with the book even though I wanted to quit. I should have quit. It just wasn't my type of book even though there were a few incidents I enjoyed. Maybe it would have helped to have read some of his other books first."
2,Hard to recommend this one,"I agree with the other reviewers who comment on the second half/finish of the book. After over 1200 pages too much is left unresolved. I might feel differently if there was a direct sequel continuing the story of these characters, but of course there isn't one.While I still enjoyed the setting and the development of the character's view of their world and their strategy for dealing with it, it's really more of the same from Shogun and Taipan. Further, possibly the most interesting character, Tess Struan, appears in the book only through her letters written to other characters.Wish I'd read 1200 pages of something else."
2,Let Down,"Gai-Jin was heavy reading. As much as I had enojyed Clavell's previous novels, the prose in Gai-Jin read like an author stumbling through a long and complicated story. Subjects changed mid-paragraph; long rambling and purple prose abutting coarse and violent actions; suspended action with long periods of inconsequntial thoughts and descriptions; rapid changes of third and first person thoughts and dialogue; rapid changes of peoples' characters; uses of aliases and new names suddenly appearing with little or no introduction, etc. etc. Finally, the plot itself held promise but was not realized. It seems that Clavell anticipated writing a sequel that never came about."
2,Really disappointing,"I read Shogun before and it's binding is falling apart as it was an hand me down.I really expected more...I somewhat expected the characters to be engaging and somewhatrealistic.I was left unconvinced by his characterizations of British,American and even Japanese.I actually found the Japanese characters more believable than the""Gai-Jins"".The novel is in my mind a failure and the history of the era seem also faulty in it's interpretation.I think that even the names of the Japanese characters are totally falsein historical terms from what I can find in history books."
3,"Okay, not great","Sometimes amusing, sometimes irritating. Too often the writing seems to be there only in order to show off mr Clavell's research that he however hasn't put in perfect use, as others have pointed out.I have a question. Why Angelique? Why do I have to suffer trough the mewlings of the airhead? And however unearthily beautiful, do all the men of the book really have so unified taste as to drool after the self-centered bimbo?I liked the Japanese characters much better than the gai-jin. Was rooting for the shishi all the time.I love to read about the samurai era Japan, but next time I'll pick a Japanese author."
3,Teachers can use this book as an example to scold students .,"The author, the late James Clavell, had seven fictions left for us to remember him. And this one is the last one. A little error, timing was not as the actual historical events, the Russian authors, Dostoyevsky(1821-1882) and Tolstoi((1828-1910) mentioned in this book were not in that era, but that didn't affect the readable of this book. Fron this book, we learned that the strong powers, such as Great Britain, France, Prusia, Russia,even the USA, forced Japan to open her doors for foreign trading. Now we know that if, only if, that our ancestors didn't do that, then there wouldn't be the event of Pearl Harbour or Japanese's involvement in the WWII. But from that, we've learned nothing. Or-else, China, a communism Country, a Totalitarian Country wouldn't be a threat to the world peace."
2,Boring....,"What can I say? I got this book from a secondhand bookshop and I sat down excited and started reading it. In a month I have only managed to read 50 pages. Despite my expectations this book turned out to be so boring. Clavell could have easily described what he did in 50 pages in less than 15- the writing is so long-winded that makes you lose interest...The book is still on my desk and I don't think I'll ever finish it. I wouldn't advise anyone to buy it, unless you have a lot of patience."
1,Gai-Jin=Chore+Bore,"This is probably the most excruciatingly boring book I have ever read. Were it not for the $22.95 that I spent on it and my previous joy with Clavells' work, I would have detached myself from it and thrown it in the trash. The characters are shallow beyond belief, with the men fawning over the resident bimbo with nauseating chivalry. Having read it some time ago, I'm now struggling with any memory I have of this ridiculous story to vent here. Don't waste your time or money!"
2,Slow and boring,"I love history and was really impressed by Clavell in Shogun and Tai-Pan, though I never understood the need for renaming the true historical characters such as Tokugawa vs. Toranaga, etc...In any case - this book is horrendously slow. The last half is just being plain awful. It fills like Clavell was being paid per word and had to come up with as many of them as he could describing totally ordinary events that hardly deserve mentioning, while leaving aside so much that could be very interesting.Definitely NOT RECOMMENDED, especially if you value your time."
3,Gai Jin,"I picked up Gai Jin in a used book store for $1.00 and was hooked by page 3 (before even leaving the store). I vaguely remember reading Shogun as it was over ten years ago. Anyway, Gai Jin's pace is fast and the plot's twists and turns were quite exciting. However, as a Chinese American, I felt the way the Asians (Japanese and Chinese) depicted in this novel-and perhaps in all his books - was less than complimentary. Granted that Gai Jin's heroine and other non-Asian characters were as scheming and devious, I was left feeling a bit queasy as Clavell's books are read by the millions and unless the readers know better, Clavell's images would be all they have of Asians. Otherwise, I thought the book was entertaining and enjoyable. The ending was left a bit too loose as though a sequel could be conjured up. But alas, with Clavell's passing..."
2,"This ain't no 'Shogun', baby","I read James Clavell's other novel of Japan, 'Shogun' obsesively, and finishing all 1000+ pages in under five days. This one, on the other hand, I have attempted to read twice, and NEVER finished it. Compared to the epic 'Shogun', this book was very slow and clunky. It is based in fact - the result of the forced opening of Japan in the mid-late 19th century. however, the story is so realistic as to be dull. Truth may be stranger than fiction, but in this case anyway, it is hardly as interesting. The story itself is very coherent and easy to follow. It is just too DULL. If you are looking for another ""Shogun"", aside from a few interesting (stress on few) tie-ins to ""Shogun"", there is nothing there. Shogun was the pinacle for Clavell. This just might be the nadir."
5,FANTASITIC!,"This wonderful read is absolutely engrossing and gorgeous instyle. It intcludes war, sex, betrayal, love, death, life....Everything you could want in a book. It is NOT as good as SHOGUN or TAI-PAN, but it is the next best book. I also recommend THE POWER OF ONE, THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH, IT (king), A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and OF MICE AND MEN."
2,Clavell has written many great novels - just not this one.,"Unlike Shogun or Noble House, two of my favorite books of all time, it was as if Clavell stopped writing 2/3 of the way through and someone who was incredibly rushed finished the book as fast and as awkwardly as possible. I've read just about all of Clavell's works and this one was either finished by someone else who had never read Clavell or was the work of a very sick man with a tight deadline."
3,Exhausting,"Shogun Ok but this just dragged, well written and historically interesting, but painfully slow. Should have sexed it up more, characters not developed,"
3,NO comparison To Shogun!!!,"I am a 16 year old Japanese student and I, like a few other readers, before reading this book, thought Clavell was amazing. NOw I think he is semi-amazing. I read Shogun, and I was completely drowned in the book, I lived it as well as the characters' lives. HOwever, I think Gai-Jin took all the wonderful aspects of Shogun to the extreme.Clavell still takes the reader right into the story, and, as always, thrills us with his understanding of the Japanese way, but he goes a bit too far... I find there is way too much sex and lust... all surrounding the character of Angelique Richaud. I don't understand why he chose to put her in the novel as such a big part of it.. I agree she is a vital part, but I don't understand why every time Clavell would write anything about the gai-jin that he would have to include something about either Andre fantasizng about raping her, or someone else checking her out.Other than that, the book was amazing."
2,Too Many Typos,"I am a fan of James Clavell. I enjoyed the story as I have enjoyed all of his other books. Gai-Jin is the first of his books I have read on my Kindle. I could not believe how many serious typographical errors were in the e-book. Most could be figured out by context, but some were so bad the intended word was completely lost. One was nothing but numbers. It was apparent a non-English speaking person transcribed the book into electronic format. This book makes me apprehensive about buying future e-books if they are so poorly transcribed.Gai- Jin."
2,can't recommend this book.,"Shogun is one of my favorite books, and I was pleased to find Gai-Jin in a used book store while I was travelling in New Zealand.Unfortunately, I just can't recommend Gai-Jin. I struggled through the first half, hoping that it would really grab me at some point, but alas, it didn't. I did a ""spot read"" of the second half of the book, and really don't feel like I missed anything that was really worth taking the time to finish it properly. I just never cared about any of these characters. Too bad."
3,Downgrade from Taipan!!!,"After reading ""Taipan"", it was extremely disappointing going into ""Gaijin"". The story line just dragged on and on. The author probably could've eliminated at least 200 pages. Also, this book lacks the strong characters that existed in ""Taipan"". TWO THUMBS DOWN!!!!!!!!"
2,Very Disappointing,This is not one of my favorite Clavell books - It is longwinded and the ending (is there one ? ) is appalling
1,"Hackneyed plot, stereotyped characters","This book was unfortunately rather bad. It was full of cliched characters, so-so plot twists and offensive racial stereotyping. There seems to be little attempt to explore the culture and plenty of ways in which it exploits it. Clavell introduces all the possible racial stereotypes he can e.g. the beautiful, lustful French woman, the suicidal Japanese spy, the greedy and conniving Chinese servants, the upright English man. The list goes on. Some of the dialogue appears to be straight from a B movie. As an Asian, I felt quite offended by certain sections of the novel."
1,A total come down from a great writer,"Gai-Jin, the last of James Clavel's books and in my opinion is his worst. If you are a James Clavel fan and have not yet read this book I suggest that you don't and if you are a first time reader start with ""Shogun"" or ""Taipan"". Pathetic, is the best word I can use to describe this novel. It really brought down my opinion of James Clavel as a great author."
3,Unfocused,"I have just revisited all the James Clavell novels. Most were like visiting old friends just as I enjoy the James Mitchener novels. This one, however, lacks a strong central character. The reader is forced to wonder from character to character hoping that one will emerge as dominate. That never happens.Other than this fatal flaw, the book is long and drawn out and I finished it only because I started it."
5,Captivating!,"I was surprised to hear that people didn't enjoy this book! I loved it. It definitely was not Shogun, but then again, what is??? I still think that this book provided much entertainment and suspense. I couldn't put it down! I'm looking forward to reading the rest of James Clavell's novels. (Why is Whirlwind out of print?)"
2,disappointing,"After reading Shogun and Tai-pan, I was expecting that Gai-jin would be of the same quality, it wasn't. The story moves far too slowly. This 1200 page novel could easily have been half that size. The story itself was a good one, but I was hard pressed to spend the time to finish it.Gai-jin may be an okay novel, but is doesn't measure up to Clavell's previous works. It's a sad end to the career of a great author."
3,"Not as good as Shogun, but good","This is good and pretty well-written. I was hoping it would really draw me in like ""Shogun"" did, but I didn't really get emotionally invested in these characters. For one thing, there are a LOT of characters, and I had trouble keeping some of them straight. However, it's decent and worth a read."
3,Left Hanging With Many Questions,"I need more. What happened to Angelique and Gornt? How did Tess deal with the Gornt scheme? Quillan in Noble house is obviously a descendant of Gornt with the hate continuing - even though the Noble House was written first. There is a Marlowe in Noble house, a descendant of Capt Marlowe? Did Jamie marry that stupid Irish girl that followed him to Japan? And Hiraga, my favorite, what happened with him? Did he make it to England? All these carefully created characters and no ending for them? The book really had me involved but I was left looking for a sequel. Had it not been for the hanging, I would have given this a 4 star."
2,Gai-Junk,"James Clavell's writing in Gai-Jin probably contains the worst grammar and syntax ever written by a published novelist. Once you get beyond that though, there's decapitations, rapes, castrations, the mild titillations of the 'Flower World', and a host of laughable characters. There's Andre Poncin, the syphilitic spy with the perverse heart; there's the impossibly beautiful Angelique with the hourglass waist who every man swoons over; there's the tyrannical Tess Straun (whom we never meet) who makes men and women quake with fear. There are plots within plots that are sometimes hard to follow due to Clavell's butchering of the English language. Despite all this, the book is strangely enjoyable in a depraved way. There are so many loose ends at the book's end that it is obvious that Clavell was planning a sequel. Alas, Mr. Clavell passed on and we'll never know what happened to our poor Angelique, the dashing Mr.Gornt, or the wicked Tess."
2,disappointint,I can not believe I wasted a month reading this book. It has way too much sex and violence and moves too slowly. It is nothing like Tai-Pan or Noble House (which I am now reading for the second time.) I'm glad I got it at a used book store and did not have to pay full price for it.
5,one of the best ballads ever!!,"as i was growing up, this was one of the greatest songs ever.(well, at least for me it was) 'till this day i still get goose bumps on my skin, when ever i hear it. very very sad song :( does anybody know the name of the lady that sings it, what ever happened to her, please repply if anybody knows her name!!!!"
1,Liberal Craziness,"If you are a woman, the story declares, it is normal for you to be gang raped by men who live in your neighborhood. Resign yourself to this fate. They need to vent. They need to express their frustrations. Do not seek or even desire any justice. Do not secure your home. Do not move away. In fact, try to protect the rapists' families at any cost. Fathers, accept your daughters being perpetual rape victims. Why should a movie so willingly accept (and even celebrate???) the sad fact that parts of Africa still have these attitudes."
4,Disgrace,I saw the movie before I read the book and I'm glad I read the book later as my opinion on the main charater changed after reading the book. My impression of the main character....in the book....was of a man deeply flawed but not to the extent that Malkovitch portrayed him in the movie. I think that the South African accent came across as very stilted and this influenced my opinion of the man. In the book this was not so.I rate the book highly because it deals with a problem that is two-sided and does not seem ...to me ....to take a side one way or the other. A very introspective look at black/white relations in South Africa.
3,Odd and haunting,"At first, I thought this to be an odd movie for John Malkovich. He is not a good guy, but also not a totally bad person in typical John Malkovich fashion, but the movie is haunting and not a happy one. I think it is worth seeing, but don't plan on humming any theme music from this one."
4,"Semi-successful, complex film","This falls down early when we must believe that the young college student whom the professor seduces has no choice in the matter. Perhaps because it was her first film role, we don't quite believe that. However, it is the incident upon which the whole film then revolves, as the professor gets fired, moves to a rural farm and endures a harsh attack on him and his daughter. Uncomfortable scenes of dogs being euthanized are shown. The South African landscape and photography are stunning, and we do see much of why this country is such a conundrum. The new complexities of its social scene are the real underpinnings of the film and the J.M. Coetzee novel upon which it based. The extras provide context and should be watched. A thoughtful film with a few flaws, but watchable, nonetheless. You will not much like the selfish John Malkovich character, but he does a great acting job."
4,"Kind of weird, but hey, it's Malkovich acting.....","It's a good movie, although the acceptance of rape seems unusual. However, it's art work and I guess it's OK in that setting--the way protagonist's daughter moves on or copes. It had several issues that it touched on--gender, sex, race, romance, salvation and so on.The movie made me depressed a bit, I personally wanted those kids dead, simple. But I guess the world, and movies in it, won't let things go my way."
1,What a Disgrace!,"Steve Jacobs so-called adaptation of Coetzee's beautiful novel is nothing less than a Disgrace. Malkovich is creepy from the beginning (made worse by a bad attempt at a South African accent) and all of the humanity of the book is gone. Not to mention that Jacobs clearly doesn't get the point! It is hards to fathom how this got any positive ratings, but easy to see why it wasn't released in the US. This is nothing less than a travesty. If you've never read the book and like soap operas you might find some redeeming quality. But if you appreciate great literature you will need to look elsewhere. It is squeamish and painful in every frame while never touching any of the deep issues Coetzee wrote about."
1,Seriously Depressing,"I kept waiting for this movie to reach some kind of enlightenment, but instead it was terribly depressing all the way to the end (aided by the same kind of haunting music over and over). Depressing and disturbing. If rape, attempted suicide, misuse of power, violence and mental illness aren't enough to take you down, maybe the constant putting dogs to sleep, shooting and burying them will do it."
1,A Disgrace,"The other negative (one-star) reviewers said it way better than I could. I want my 2 hours back.""DISGRACE stands out as a gritty, gripping drama of brutality, survival and hope.""What ""hope""???"
4,Excellent for the price,"For the price, these clamps are just as easy to use and just as strong as the comparable fixtures from other manufacturers. I recommend them strongly for any bar clamp applications."
4,Brought back great memories,"This is a fun book that brought back a lot of fond memories. In addition to remembering all the wacky escapades of Klink and company, I was intrigued to read about the backstage history and the actors' real lives. Well done!"
4,Hogan's Hereos: Behind the Scenes at Stalag 13!,"Yes, I enjoyed the book. It was an interesting look at a classic comedy television series."
4,A fun read,"I had just begun to watch reruns of ""Hogan's Heroes"" when TVLand suddenly yanked it from their schedule, for whatever reason. I decided to read this book in order to see what I'd missed. I thought it was a really fun read, especially the biographies/filmographies of the cast members. It's very thorough (encompassing all the episodes, lots of interesting behind-the-scenes stuff, et cetera) and I imagine any fan of the show will enjoy reading it a lot."
5,"I'm not a Texan, and I don't play one on TV but . . .","I'm a journalist, a sports fan, amateur historian and the fourth great-granddaughter of the amazing Peter Sides, a Revolutionary War Veteran who was killed at the bloodiest battle on Texas soil, the Battle of Medina in 1813.You don't believe me? Look it up!I first read this book years ago and loved it. I've recommended it to others who have loved it. It's a fabulous read and rollicking adventure. It's the kind of book I keep re-reading and buying any copy I can find and passing it on to people I love.Please excuse the passive voice in the previous paragraph. I know better ; )Fast Copy is a lot of lively fun!"
5,"Oh, Christmas tree!","I adore this tree! It it 9 feet of bright, full, easy-to-assemble holiday cheer! It takes just a few minutes to assemble. Probably 15 minutes when you first get it because you need to unwrap the sections and read instructions. After that, you're up in five minutes! Fluffing the branches takes about 30 minutes. I'm able to get it looking very full, and when we add ornaments, you can't even see the center pole.I found that it's just the right width also. It's not too skinny, or too wide that it needs it's own room. It fits perfectly in our living room.It comes with a metal, four-footed base and plenty of spare lightbulbs."
4,Great Tree - As Advertised!,"This tree works great! It was a great price, with free shipping when I bought after Christmas last year. I opened it up before the holidays this Christmas, set it up easily - 2 people with ladder required, all the lights work fine and it looks great! Thanks Amazon!"
5,Harmony Stitch Guide Vol. 4,"I purchased Vols. 2, 3, & 4 at the same time through Amazon, and had purchased Vol. 5 (Aran Stitches and Patterns) at my local yarn store. While these books are not meant to give you complete patterns, like for an entire sweater, they provide seemingly endless ideas for patterned stitches, including cables, knit/purl combos, slip stitch mosaics, texture & color stitch techniques, and even lace patterns. I'm so thrilled with these books that I hardly know where to start with the experimentation, but I would definitely recommend the entire collection to anyone serious about knitting or designing their own knitted items."
4,BLS for Healthcare Providers,I think this is a great book. Very helpful for anyone who is planning on receiving a degree in the medical field.
1,not what I received,"I purchased the Neiko USA 24"" Wet Tile saw and receiveed the Proline Wet Saw. The picture is different then what I received. The one I received seems to work well I am just unhappy that I didn't get the Neiko. Besure to watch what you receive."
3,Not What I Ordered,"My comments are the same as the last review. I ordered the Neiko USA 24"" Wet Tile Saw w/stand and I received the Pro-Line. No response back from customer service as to why a different brand/model was shipped.Pro Line is nice, does same job as Neiko though."
3,"Gets the job done, but SLOW","It works fine, but is a lot slower than the charger that came with the phone. Takes about 6 hours to fully charge the phone."
5,Awesome Service!,"We ordered two different kinds of chargers (a plug in and a car one) and they contacted us to confirm the right products since they were not compatible, and corrected our order to the right procuct! AWESOME!"
4,Another hit by Thompson,"This book covers some of the same topics as Thompson's classic, Positive Coaching. However, it has some new ideas in it, and also has some lessons learned since Positive Coaching was written. It also has a handbook-type approach - it gives you example talks, helps you plan a practice and also shows you ways to help you acquire Positive Coaching skills. I have found all of Jim Thompson's books enjoyable and enlightening."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I bought this book as a text required for a class I was taking, and during the course of that semester, I got to be so overwhelmed with the number of readings that this book fell by the wayside. I was later asked to teach a course, and I thought I should immerse myself in current theory. I cracked the spine on this one, finally, and I was disappointed. There are a few good ideas scattered here or there, but for the most part, it reads like someone trying to get a book deal by strrrrrrrretching the material."
5,"i took for a year, lost 70lbs.","Strict diet and hard exercise. I didn't get jittery, it was like drinking about 3 cups of coffee... i popped these like candy. 3 with a meal."
5,Great,"Great buy, exactly what i wanted, buyer was great very fast and reasonable, prize was awesome very cheap for this product, would recommend to anyone,"
3,works but be careful,"I would say they work but at the same time you have to be careful. Now I know everyone is different but, when I took these pills the made my chest hurt, I say it started a week after I started these pills. At first I thought it could have been something else, so I did my own little test. I stop taking them for two weeks and I was fine so I told myself I would start them again but when I did, again my chest started hurting so I had to stop taking them.I had success with the stacker 2 so I will be going back to those, one more thing you have to workout as well if you take them and just sit around the stacker products wont work."
2,Rapid Heart Rate,I dont recommend using this product.It is not effective for weight loss.I suspect the increased heart rate and blood pressure after taking this product is quite dangerous!
1,How is this still on the market?,"I took these once a day for five days with meals. On the fifth day I started experiencing serious side effects like dizzyness, numbness in my fingers, and rapid heartbeat. These side effects lasted for almost THREE DAYS after taking it. I felt like I was going to have a stroke or a heart attack. This product is not approved by the FDA, so use it at your own risk!"
3,Fat Burner worth it?,"You really need to understand what is in Stacker 3 before taking it. The bottom line is if you are really over weight, don't bother. If only a little weight needed to shed, give it a try.Full review here: h[...]"
3,Use Caution,"The first day is the hardest, Im still apprehensive about the pill.Ive been experiancing minimal side effects: No appetite (not bad), Minimal amounts of dizzy, and alittle off in general...However Im going to take some tomorrow, I hear that it gets better and better as your body gets accustom to the pill...The worst was when I though it possible I was going to throw up... I will try 2 more days and see what happens, if the results are bad I will post again...Otherwise it feels like its doing its job and the side effects are minimal. Im doing this with a little diet, not much exercise except my job where I lift alot...right now it could go anyway. Definatly take during a meal... I suggest taking 1/2 dose at first or eating breakfast and lunch then taking it..."
2,Awake all night.,"Now I try to limit my caffeine intake to the bare minimum, like in tea. I do not drink coffee. So when I took Stacker 3 (just ONE PILL) I was jittery and could not fall asleep. I stayed wide awake the whole night and through the day. I felt nauseus too. Now this was probably because I don't drink coffee or anything that has a lot of caffeine in it, but I don't recommend Stacker 3 anyway."
1,Ineffective,"More or less, a hoax. None of these things quite honestly WORK and they're very expensive to buy. Not impressed at all."
3,Alright!,"It doesn't help with weight loss but I noticed that whatever you eat, it strengthens your metabolism and makes sure the fat is intercepted within your body causing you to not get a bulge after you eat..So I can eat whatever I want and not gain weight basically..It changes your metabolism! I like it!"
3,Works but gives headaches,"Stacker 3 helped me to lose weight faster on top of working out, but after 2 days I started getting bad migraines so I only took it once a day. Once I did that it stopped working."
4,Good Picker-Upper,"I've been taking Stackers on and off for a few years. However, I usually only take one in the morning to get me alert for the day as a substitute for coffee. It has the caffeine equivalent of around 2 large cups of coffee and I feel it keeps me going through a long days work.I am not overweight and therefore have not tried using it for its intended weight loss purpose. I can say that it does decrease appetite, on days that I take a Stacker in the morning I am more likely to eat a light lunch. Be aware that due to the high caffeine content, it will keep you up at night if taken around dinner time.Overall, I do recommend this product and have not had any adverse side effects. However, as mentioned earlier I cannot say if it is an effective weight loss pill or not."
3,Good Start,"This seems like a good start to give a general over view of Caribbean Pirates. It runs a little over an hour. Talks about general things with pirates, then dives into a few facts on certain major pirates. Will probably learn some from the movie and it can keep you entertained. There is no acting in it, but there are several stock footage from other movies on pirates when they talk about a subject. It gives me a good start on other things to look up and learn about."
4,Real Review,This is a great video you must watch. It's full of adventure and it really tells what happened in the age of pirates.
4,Quite a Storyteller!!,"The travails and triumphs of young Rose will touch your heart and leave you wanting more! The lives and loves of this young woman, subjected to cruelty and the oppression that was so common in early 1800's England, will break your heart...then make you rejoice ultimately. She grows to womanhood in this story, which, with its description of life at this time in history, will make you feel you are there living through life as it was. Enjoy (and pray for more from this new author!)."
3,Phonics is the only way to go!,"Colorful letters and words greatly enhance phonics learning. However, they should never be used to aid whole-language because sight-reading can trigger dyslexia. I hope this is not another ""fix"" in the whole-language fiasco, but rather an aid for good, systematic phonics reading."
4,Sticky Buns Made Me Want to Read More and Eat More,"I was very lucky to receive an autographed copy of this mystery from the author herself. I read it and enjoyed it so much, I bought the other books in the series.The author presents Tori as a spunky - no quirky - (are these words used too much? - not in this case) - heroine, star, and detective in a delightful New England cozy.In addition to the mystery, several recipes for the sticky buns are given which did not help my diet at all.For anyone who wants to stay in bed on a rainy day with a good murder mystery/cozy, I much recommend this book. Very tasteful and fattening."
4,A terrific series from the era when TV was fun to watch,"Hunter was not a great TV series but, compared to most of what's available now, it was terrific. Hunter, an honest but maverick cop from a criminal background, was adeptly played by former football star Fred Dryer (the only player in NFL history to score two safeties in one game). His partner Dee Dee McCall was played by beautiful and spunky Stepfanie Kramer. Together they broke every rule in the book but always got the bad guys, no matter how the odds were stacked against them. Hunter wasn't an accurate portrayal of police work, and it definitely wasn't politically correct, but it was a lot of fun. I'm glad that it's now available on DVD."
3,Hunter tv series review,"I haven't finished viewing all the dvd's for this series. I have been unable to view so far 2 of the programs out of 3 dvd's because they are garbled. Other than that, it arrived quickly. I still have another dvd to go before I'll know whether any other shows will be unwatchable."
5,Hunter Review,"EXCELLENT, my husband was thrilled with this purchase as well as Season One. I always have great resulsts with Amazon and their vendors. Thanks again, Never Disappointed.Toni 57"
3,Disappointed,"Even though I like the actors, and the plots were what one would expect, the dialog and editing left me wondering why I liked the program when it aired on TV."
5,Recommended,Very fun and easy to learn. Not as fast-paced as they say. We enjoyed the action cards which can change the course of the game.
4,I really like it!,"I really like it, but it's a little too easy for adults. Not as fast-paced as they say, as well. But, it's still fun to play! Cards are cool to look at, but a bit too slippery. Somewhat hard to shuffle and control. Overall though, a nice card game."
5,FUN!,I played this with my nieces and nephews and we played for hours. It was a ton of fun. :) I highly recommend it. It is like cranium and uno merged into one.
1,CD Deluxe Pack 4,"The CD contains a typing instructor, chess game, US atlas and a world atlas. Unfortunately, it does not work with Windows 7."
5,Love this candle,"I have this candle for about two years and absolutely love it. The smell is great, and the light is soothing. This was my first battery operated candle and I would definitely recommend it."
3,Fourth Dawn,"I am a big fan of the Thoenes and have read every book they have written. I find it sad to say that this book is good but not one of their greatest. I have found that the A.D.Chronicles Books 1 & 3 outstanding and leave the reader anxious for the next book. I have also noted that Books 2 and 4 seem almost to be half books, unsatisfying and written in haste. Having said that, I am expecting Book 5 to be another outstanding book. I look forward to it. I consider Bodie and Brock Thoene the best Christian fiction writers. Brock's historical facts are invaluable."
4,Fourth Dawn A D Chronicles,"I found this book, as with the whole series, to be a highly descriptive depiction of life in Jesus time. You get caught up in the swirling of the crowds and motives of the people, all truly likely scenarios for the time. We often forget the impact of Israel, yet again, being a conquered people, and the fear and desperation they, like conquered people's before and since, were living under.It is a great way to start to get a grip on the myriad of challenges against Jesus message, and to begin to imagine why people reacted in the way they did. Why did the blind man's parents deny him? What was it that made Mary the optimum choice to be the mother of Jesus? How did Joseph reconcile his love for Mary and the small village mentality? These are great stories, within the wonder of a truly awesome story."
5,Fantastic book,"Absolutely a fantastic book for anyone, with or without a quantitative background. Even an atheist will step back and question his/her beliefs as he/she turns the pages from one power of ten to the next. You can read this book in either direction, from smallest to largest or largest to smallest. I suggest you read it both ways. This book belongs in the library of every creative and imaginative person."
5,Really fantastic -- share it with a child!,"I first saw this book in a film version, which was being used at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington when I was about nine years old. It had a huge impact upon me. I will never forget the feeling of understanding the universe that this film gave me. Anyone with ""math fear"" can benefit from this -- it makes vast numbers not only comprehensible, but fascinating. This can make a terrific coffee table book, or something to leave around in a school library setting.It is difficult to overstate how effective a teaching tool this book can be. I'm not kidding. If you are a primary school science or math teacher, you OWE it to the children you teach to get a copy of this. You will be doing them a disservice if you don't expose them to this. I'm not exaggerating, the book is just amazing. My rating -- 37 quadrillion thumbs up."
2,Points not sharp,The points of the tweezers are not sharp. They are blunt and unlikely to remove small slivers.
4,Low Rated Review?? Seriously?! I think not,"I don't understand those of you who are giving this a low review simply because it gets your kids' hands messy...it's finger paint, DUH. And in comparison to regular finger paint it's better since it only colors on the paper that comes with it. I have bought the kit in the shape of a hand twice for my near 2 yr old and she has rubbed it on herself and tried to use it to color on the walls of her playroom several times and it never once stained a thing. I find it is easy to clean her hands off after she's done too. The only negative comment I can make is that I wish crayola sold each color in a large tube because my daughter loves to paint with this and I like it too."
5,We love the fingerpaints,"It's true that my 2 year old digs her nails into the product, but she is two. My four year old uses this quite well and it is great fun. We love it. I have never had it stain a thing."
1,I Agree!,"I agree with the first users review - this stuff is horrible! My kids would dig their fingers into the goo and then it would get stuck under their nails and make the biggest slimy mess! The other color wonder products are awesome, but this one is a really bummer!"
4,Eminently effective,"Need more cowbell? Maybe you just need a better cowbell beater, which this product surely is. Stout, strong and comfortable to handle - Meinl's cowbell beater will make your smaller cowbells ring out strong and provide optimum sound from larger bells."
2,Broke on second use,The wood can not hold up to moderate use. It broke on second use. Spend a few more buck and buy better.
2,More advanced than I anticpated.,"I thought that a book with this title would have a significant beginners section for a starting whittler, but it doesn't. The book is primarily a pattern book with some hints for working the wood and possibly a short history for pattern classifications. A redeeming factor is the patterns have a front and side shot. Complicated patterns, such as a dutch shoe will have exploded details. A nice book if your looking for what to do next. Not a good learning book for beginners. Bill Hampton (billsducks@aol.com)"
2,Not for begginers,"I was disappointed in this book because I was hoping this would provide tips for someone with absolutely no experience to get started on. It doesn't do that. Basically, it has a lot of different patterns to use once you are already carving. If that's what you're looking for, it might be a good book for you."
4,The Big Book...,If and when I might get good at wood carving I might consult this book for designs and so on. There was alot of history about some of the patterns which was interesting.
4,good for a little touch up,I mix and match a few colors to get a shade that matches my hair and use it at the front where gray is sneaking in. Like it!
2,washes out within 2 weeks,"I've used several brands of henna before, and can say with confidence that this is by far the worst. Not only was the initial color very orange over my blonde hair, but most of the color washed out after 3 washes. Huge disappointment. I recommend Light Mountain Naturals brand instead."
2,Not as advertised.,Not only does this leave your hair very dry but it left my hair with an ugly dishwater blonde instead of an actual strawberry blonde. YUCK. Will not buy again.
3,Surya Henna Strawberry Blonde,I have naturally curly hair in a dark brown color and wanted the strawberry blonde boost for the summer however this product did not lighten up my hair color very much however it did make it really soft. I might try a lighter shade of blonde next time to see how it takes.
5,so much easier,This product is so much easier than the mix-up henna. Color looks great - hope it lasts.
1,Didn't cover any of my gray,"I'm disappointed to say that this product didn't cover any of my gray hairs. There is no change in my hair color whatsoever. I used the whole bottle and left it on for 40 minutes. (My original hair is brown, but I followed the instructions for white, hoping to cover my ""gray"" hairs, which are actually more like silver than white.)I've tried other hennas before, and they didn't affect my gray hairs either. I thought that maybe I just wasn't doing a good enough job with the hard-to-use powdered and solid hennas. I thought that maybe this easy-to-use cream would produce some results for me. But I think I'm about ready to give up on henna; I think that maybe there is just something about my hair that henna refuses to stick to.On the positive side, the product was easy to apply and rinse off, didn't irritate my scalp and didn't smell too bad. So it could be a perfect non-toxic product for someone whose hair it would actually stick to."
2,"It is RED, nothing ash or brown about it.","The word ASH signifies NO RED. The manufacturer deceiptfully is labeling this product as the exact opposite merely to sell the product. There is no brown. It is simply red, red, red. I guess red is better than grey, but label it red then!"
3,May be the wrong choice,"The quality of the Kreg screws is very good, but, the SLM-C1 Washer-Head screws may not be the best choice for pocket hole joints. For wood that is "" thick the pockets are so shallow that the larger washer-head (vs pan-head) screws will actually protrude above the surface of the wood! You can use them on projects where you are joining a thicker than "" piece to another "" thick piece, and probably gain a little strength over the smaller head pan-head screw, but, I would recommend just getting the pan-head screws and save yourself the hassle!"
3,Encyclopedia of the American Indian,"Bruce Grant's now rather dated volume is a good resource for school students or for those casually interested in Native culture. It is full of black and white line drawings, but most of the entries are, even for a 'concise' encyclopedia, a little brief. Although most of the information is accurate, and the book is very easy to use, by this point there are many better single volume reference books on these peoples."
2,Maybe OK for pre-packaged? Maybe?,"This tapenade tastes of vinegar and vegetable oil, but sadly not of olive oil. It's tolerable as a topping on a fish fillet or even grilled beef, but left to its own devices, with its own flavor ""shining"" fully through, it's a pretty bad tapenade. I'll be inventing ways to use up the remaining 5, but never ordering again."
5,Delicious!,"My wife got me hooked on this stuff. Before that I had never even heard the word ""tapenade"". We like to combine one jar of this with one jar of their Sundried Tomato Tapenade and a splash of red wine. Mix it up and put it on some Crostinis. You wont be disappointed. I'm normally a meat-and potatoes-guy, and I love this stuff."
3,Intresting but not Special,"I find this a hard film to review. The story is dramatic but not gripping. Charles Boyer gives a steady performance but I think he is too old for the role. Joan Fontaine gives a good performance as the 14 year old who loves him, but my favourite character is Charles Coburn, who on being told that the Italian butler`s name is Roberto, insists on calling him Robert-O. It makes me smile every time I hear it.The story concerns a composer trying to write a mastepiece while at the same time, coping with a new wife who is very jealous of the rapport between Charles Boyer and Joan Fontaine and the support that she is giving him. To add to their problems, she has a bad heart.An OK film but not up to Charles Boyer`s usual standard."
3,OK,"It's all been said before....nothing new or exciting....easy to read....if you need a ""quick fix""...but I won't be reading/buying his stuff again!"
3,"OK, but not as advertised","Just received these screws, and they are fine, except they do NOT have a bronze finish as written in the product description. The screws I received have a shiny zinc coating, and do not appear to be as high quailty as every other Kreg screw that I have seen. I will most likely be returning these and ordering a smaller box in hopes of getting the standard bronze finish."
2,Disappointed,"I actually purchased these screws because they were described as having a BRONZE colored finish. Wrong. They are a shiny chrome finish, which is not what I wanted. I'll keep them, but please change your product description, so customers won't be misled. I don't know why Kreg ever changed these to the shiny finish. Nobody wants them to stick out like a sore thumb."
3,"Combo head, not square head.","The add and the box stated square head screws, but they are combo and don't hold on the driver as well."
3,NOT A SLASHER FILM,"I was expecting a slasher type of film from the DVD cover. Instead what I got was more akin to a historical drama. This is what we believe is the story of Albert De Salvo (David Faustino), the man who confessed to being the Boston Strangler. The film shows several women being strangled, but not really grindhouse style, more of a Hitchcock style. The accents were good. The acting and plot was decent, although the story just never grabbed me. There is no nudity and no graphic rape scenes, just disturbing strangling scenes. It is interesting from an historical sense, but not overly entertaining, yet not a bad film. Hence the so-so rating.F-bombs."
1,disappointing,"We were on a serial killer kick and decided to check this out and it was very slow. Also, it seems to lack some information. From the movie Albert was jobless and in a somewhat disfunctional marriage and was paid to appear in police line ups. It only shows Albert killing one woman. The rest are done by other people. Yet, it mentions that the 5 original victims were older and the others were copycats. So Albert didn't kill every one of them...but only the one? Anyway, when the police arrest him the movie doesn't show why or what evidence they have on him. The police just pull him over in a car and the next thing you know Albert is in jail. It would have been nice to have been shown the reasons. Also, the movie never cleared up why exactly Albert was so attached to his prison roommate. The acting was ok. It was interesting to see the young man who played Bud Bundy in a much different role."
2,BUD BUNDY CHOKES,"This ""untold story"" of Albert DeSalvo, who claimed to be The Boston Strangler suggests that Desalvo really wasn't guilty and was merely a conman and pervert. It has been assumed that Desalvo was not the Strangler due to evidence collected later and the case remains unsolved.David Faustino (MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) is miscast as Desalvo. His perfomance is a caricature of method acting with little polish or maturity. I just didn't find him convincing at all. Ditto to Andrew Divoff as the world-weary detective, Kostas Sommer as Desalvo's co-conspirator and possibly more, and Corin Nemec's turn as the sheisty lawyer. Writer/director Michael Feifer has little artistic vision or sense of creativity. He offers an alternate theory but doesn't commit to exploring or exposing the alternative strangler.Overall, an interesting premise lost in a dull execution."
1,Not Impressed,Purchased two units one of which was defective. Contacted Iconcepts for resolve and waited almost a month for a replacement to arrive. Found that the device will work on a laptop computer but not on a desktop computer. All in all i am not satisfied with the product.
5,Perfect,"I waited until I used this a few months before posting a review...well made...however..this is for indoor use only because the back of the mirror is cardboard...so I bought a can of spray rubber coating, sprayed the back..4 coats...and it has been rained on with no I'll effects."
2,indoor mirror,"Inexpensive mirror, expensive shippingarrived in good shapeI searched for an outdoor mirror, but this does not have a plastic back.Product info on AMAZON and the vendor were not descriptive enough."
3,"Good candies, wrong flavors.","The mochi was great, however the flavors I received were actually;Melon, Sesame seed, Mango, Red Bean, Green Tea, and Lyche, and Peanut butter.So I would suggest updating the page to reflect the correct product information."
2,Im very dissapointed,"I am very dissapointed in this set I didn't get any of what I actually wanted at all :( I got peanut, sesame melon mango and strawberry in my set it wasn't what I orderered at all and the brand wan't even the same.I definately will never order anything from JT again.... I was looking forward to eating mochi for weeks and was let down immensly. Im so bummed........."
1,"Not as good as I thought, nor a good value.","Some of these just tasted outright bad. Bad. Only the strawberry flavor is good. And at $47, I felt ripped off. Not as fun as it looks to try these foods. The majority of these do not taste sweet. Some taste weird, and unpleasant. Some taste like raisins. Even the Melon flavor was not as good as it seemed."
2,Pillow review,"The pillows look nice, but there is insufficient support for your head/neck when you sleep without sleeping on 2 of them."
5,Great Pillow,"If you like a very soft pillow, this is for you. I am a stomach sleeper and I love it because my neck isn't kinked up as with a firm pillow. My husband thinks it's too soft because he is a back sleeper. This is by far the best, softest pillow I have ever owned."
4,Good pillow for the money,"This isn't a high end pillow, but for the money, it is really nice. I would buy it again. (Put the pillow in the dryer to fluff it up every once and awhile and definitely once it arrives and before using.) I have seen quite a few pillows for more money in the stores that have much less down and have less support."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"The book made of Guthrie's song translates to written form suitable for very young children. It is mildly entertaining as a book, and the artwork, while flat and lopsided, is bearable. However, the accompanying CD is shamefully bad. I recommend skipping the book and buying one of Guthrie's CD's for children. The songs are much better when Guthrie sings them and accompanies himself. The music on this CD is as flat as the artwork in the book--no more banjo, please! On top of that, the mediocre musicians are accompanied by the Half Tone-Deaf Children's Chorus. The fourth track on the CD is a long, inane ""discussion"" between the book's artist and some children who are much too young and suggestible to have anything interesting (or even cute) to say. I recommend not wasting time on this package at all. If you do buy it, keep the book and turn the CD into a frisbee."
3,Complicated for a beginner!,I felt that Stephanie did not cue the moves very well. She was hard to follow and some of the moves were difficult to get the hang of! That said-I am new to The Firm workouts and hopefully will get more comfortable with the workouts. I do feel that my heart rate was increased and the 30 minutes did seem to go by pretty fast.
2,AWFUL,"I am a Firm believer but I find this DVD is just awful. I should've listened to another review that said that this was good if someone is a choreographer. There are so many changes and moves that I dropped the leader & was doing my own thing half way through the workout. This DVD doesn't show Libby very often so beginners (or those attmepting to catch onto the moves) are lost as well. Everytime she said, ""new move coming up"" I just CRINGED. Good for advanced Firm users, but not for beginners or intermediates. My opinion of course. Also, I didn't have the slanted box, but even without it I was sweating. I MUCH more prefer Cardio Sculpt Blaster, and would not give this DVD to a friend. It's going to the thrift shop at my earliest convenience."
1,Buy other FIRM workouts instead,"As others have mentioned, the FIRM workouts are generally fabulous, but this has the weakest instructor of any of the many FIRM workouts I've done. Another reviewer mentioned that some of the sequences are impossible for someone ""with no dance background""; I have an extensive dance background and found the routines virtually impossible to learn, especially at the pace at which this instructor leads the class. She offers no actual instruction on how to do the moves; rather, she leads the class like a square dance caller, yelling out names of moves that someone would only know if they are experienced at step aerobics. In addition, the camera work often means you're not seeing the instructor's moves completely or from an angle where you can actually figure out the footwork, even if you slow the DVD down. There are much better FIRM workouts out there."
2,Express Cardio,I love The Firm series but this dvd was such a huge disapointment the film quality was so poor and the sound was terrible!! Also she does all of the exercises facing the other way so it's hard to follow her.
2,Great for dancers or the extremely fit.,"I love the Firm. I hate this DVD. Not only did I nearly break my ankle about 5 times and fell off the thing so many times I lost count, there are NO ""practice steps"". They just start spinning from front to back over and over without telling you what they're doing. I am not hand and foot coordinated. I have trouble making my arms and my feet do different things at the same time (I know that sounds stupid, but I have not a single dance bone in my body!! lol). I say dance because the movements are fast, spinning (literally) and akward (sp?). I just hate it. Exercise is supposed to release happy endorphins, not make you feel hopeless or angry!I'll stick to the other Firm workouts that I can modify. This one's going to a friend much more coordinated than I!"
1,Girls Look Unhealthy,"I'm a huge fan of The Firm anything, even with challenging choreography. This particular one made me almost turn it off before it got started. When the instructor introduced the other girls, two of them look so unhealthy that I didn't even want my daughter (7) who normally ""dances"" with us to see them. I'm all for looking trim, fit and healthy, but you could see these girls' bones. Not a good example for me to aspire to, nor my sweet daughters. I ended up turning it off before it was over."
3,A great workout with poor cueing.,"This workout has upbeat music with challenging moves. However, Stephanie's cueing is very poor in this one. Some of the moves are complicated, but that doesnt excuse anything. Many of the Firm's cardio moves are complicated, but many other instructors do much better job cueing those moves. I'd recomment this workout, but be weary of the tall box climb and incline step aerobics- the sets in which her signaling is at its lowest. On the bright side, dont be afraid to try Stephanie's other workouts, such as Jiggle Free Arms or Ultimate Calorie Blaster- she's much much better in both of them, and the workouts will kick your butt!"
2,This requires that you buy their step,"This video uses a modified step called the FIRM box. You probably won't be able to find this in a regular athletic store, and it costs twice the price of a regular step. Unless you already own this step, this is not the video for you."
3,"Yes, the choreography is difficult","I agree with the other reviewers that the choreography is somewhat challenging; however, it is not so challenging to prohibit purchasing this quick workout. It appears that when the Firm first released an incline type step, they decided to train using a sideview. This makes it very difficult to follow as you have to turn your head to the side to watch the television (in order to try to synch up with the performance), and thus, cannot watch the step at the same time. Trying to do it facing the television could be done, but it then, makes it hard to follow. The Firm changed this with the DVDs issued with the TransFirmer. That being said, it is a nice, short workout that does get some increase in heartrate."
5,The book is useful to a wide audience.,I liked the book for its extensive coverage and depth. The case studies are interesting and useful. Many chapters are new and hardly found in most texts. The book is highly readable. Computer professionals will find the CD containg the programs to illustrate the case studies most interesting.
4,New SpacePilot has nice features,"When Solidworks went to version 2008, I sadly had to say goodby to my classic Spacemouse--an unsupported serial device. The replacement, the 3Dconnexion SpacePilot, is a welcome replacement. The puck control has less mechanical travel than the Spacemouse, which was easy to get used to. The quality of the device is better than I expected from seeing the images. But the most useful improvement to me is the application-context-sensitive button mapping. When you change applications, the SpacePilot updates its LCD screen to show you how the buttons have been remapped for that application. When you go to Solidworks assembly mode, for example, the buttons change so that you can easily go to insert, mate, rotate, etc. Also there is a special button specifically for ""Fit"", which is a zoom-all command. Very nice, overall, and as with other 3D mice, facilitates two-handed CAD actions."
5,Beautifully Made,"The movie is a great depiction of life in Mongolian countryside 5-50 years ago, although little has changed since. It accurately depicts the level of understanding and the communiction style Mongolians have for each other. Well-made movie. Good acting by Jinjiimaa. Great title track. Nice scenary. Interesting blend of old traditional nomadic ways mixing with cars and modernization (especially in the city)"
1,Putco 580433 Element tinted Window Visors,Not real happy. It said on the description that they would fit my vehicle (Honda CRV). They didn't. Have them for sale now...no takers.
5,Difficult read but worth it,"Her style really reveals more a spiritual person than a writter, it is difficult at times to understand what she is trying to say, but you just have to stand in awe of how can someone who experienced close encounters with God is so aware of any minimal imperfection and how overwhelming is to her. It should change the reader. I should make you want to be a better person, seek perfection with more intent."
1,This was AWFUL.,"The only reason I finished this book is that it was the only reading material i had while on vacation. It was awful. The repetitive ""they hated eachother but there was such chemistry"" thing got old by the end of the first chapter -- and was repeated, ad nauseum, throughout the rest of the book (and quite nearly on every single insufferable page). Skip this and instead read ANYTHING by Marian Keyes; all of her books are the perfect Chick Lit -- especially ""Watermelon."""
2,Silly Book,"I really loved her other book, ""The Boy Next Door"" as well as reading thru my daughters copies of the ""Princess Diaries"" But this book was just silly, It almost did not seem to have been written by the same Author. I never really came to care about the two main characters and just could not figure out how they could become so sexually involved when they were running for their lives in freezing weather too..silly"
4,"Fast, sexy fun","Do you enjoy fast dialogue and action? Do you dream of hot sex in the cold Alaskan winter? Then this one's for you! Meggin Cabot, aka Patricia Cabot, aka Meg Cabot of the wonderful Princess Diaries has written another winner. Screenwriter Lou(ise) Calabrese gets stuck with the detestable (or so she would like to think) actor Jack Townsend, America's hottest hunk, when a plot to murder Jack strands them together in the Alaskan wilderness. Worse, Lou and Jack have both recently been publicly dumped, and their famous exes have run off together to get married. It's a tabloid sensation. Although Lou and Jack at first dislike each other, they are unable to control the passion that sparks between them.Ms. Cabot is a wonder with both characterization and pithy remarks, and the combination results in a delightful read that you won't want to put down. It's fast, fun and sexy. Great romance."
5,Different than her more recent work but a fun read,"Romance, action and adventure. If you like those things then you will like this book.Unlike her other adult geared books this one is a bit more graphic about sex. So, consider that if buying for a younger Cabot fan. It isn't that detailed but it is more so than any of her other books, where she gives the start and finish of the act but leaves out the middle.I enjoyed that the story sometimes got told from different perspectives. Mostly it was just Lou and Jack but you got glimpes of just about all the other characters.Definetly a good vacation or bubble bath book."
2,could not keep my interest,I read all the time. I read all genre of books. I can normally finish even the worst book but this book was horrible. I really didn't even care how it ended even though there was some suspense in the plot. Plus the kindle edition had issues which made reading it even more annoying. I returned it for a refund considering it was $9.99!! I am not sure what people that gave this book 5 stars normally read but this book has me shaking my head & doubting reviews on Amazon.
3,"Not as bad as her vampire book, but...","I definitely get the impression she's getting bored writing chick lit. The reasons I liked her books were b/c of the fresh feel of the funny heroines and the pithy way she wrote. Now it feels like she's going into her closet and removing Stock Character Woman and Stock Character Man and putting them into Hijinks Ensue Plot. Kind of disappointing, I think I'm done buying her books until she gets unstuck."
2,the writing style is what ruined this!!,"I have to be honest - I really wanted to like this book after reading the reviews, but her use of appositive phrases is extremely overdone and very annoying. Maybe it's just a personal pet peeve since I am an English teacher, but she interrupts almost every sentence with a thought interjected into the middle - ugh....a good technique but not for almost every line! It makes her sentences jilted and slows the flow of the reading...I had to abandon it. I'm sure the plot is solid, but to be considered a sophisticated writer, you need to have more than one trick in your bag concerning style."
4,Guilty pleasure,"I was a little surprised that I got into this book. I've read several books by Meg Cabot, even her teen books. I really liked her other book called The Boy Next Door. That was funny and I loaned it out to several coworkers. This one is more steamy and has really good character development. I liked how she put time into letting the reader know what the main characters were thinking and feeling. I recommend reading this book, especially if you have a long road trip to Vegas. So read it and also pick up The Boy Next Door. Enjoy!"
3,Good book but not my Fav.,I really LOVe Meg Cabot's work and I liked this book but it wasn't my favorite.
1,Fluffy,I found the situations in this book to be highly improbable and the plot line predictable. It's the first Cabot book I've read and probably the last.
3,*HUGE* fan of Cabot's other work--not this so much.,"I thought this book was dry and the characters rather unlikeable. I'm a big fan of Cabot's other books (especially ""Boy Next Door"") and maybe it was just that I had high expectations when I picked this one up, but it just wasn't that good. Read it if you have a couple of hours to waste."
2,Not her best,"I didn't care for this book. They are outrunning people who are trying to kill Jack, and in the midst of it they decide to become lovers. One part was so ""yah right!"" that I almost stopped reading right then. (I don't want to spoil it for you by telling you-but it involves a cabin). I enjoyed her book Educating Caroline, but this one didn't work for me. Seemed to be more of a mystery, and I didn't enjoy the storyline. I'm suprised it was reviewed well by others."
3,Condition of the book,"I thought the description online was very different from what it actually looked like. It was in a little worse condition than stated, but it's still readable!:)"
5,This book made me stay up all night.,"I'm not a professional review person (see?) so I'm going to keep this short.I loved this novel. Loved, loved, loved it. I don't read novels of any sort because they could actually happen. I read to escape from things that happen in real life.I've also been trying to read closer to my age group. The 20-somethings and early 30-somethings are more relatable for me, so I really liked this book and the characters."
4,She Went all the Way,"In my opinion, this book started out really slow. In fact, I put this book aside after reading around forty pages and then picked it up again a few weeks later, determined to finish.When I did pick it up again, though, I was quickly intrigued and I finished it in less than a day. Still, in my opinion it was only worthy of four stars. It seemed kind of far-fetched, and even though that is part of what I respect about Meg Cabot I thought that it could have been better."
3,Another fun Meg Cabot,"I enjoyed this book for its fast pace, likeable characters, and contemporary American feel. It does not take itself too seriously. Meg Cabot is good at voice and moves from New Yorkers to Californians with agility.Overall, however, I prefer Meg Cabot's teen novels (even though I am an adult) which offer very compelling, believable heroines speaking in their own teen dialect, generally in truly ridiculous plots which are loads of fun."
3,Read it,"Removed it from my wish list because I borrowed it from the library, wasn't that exciting to read. I love Meg Cabot, but this book just wasn't as exciting as her books normally are. I've borrowed it several times from the library and have yet to get through an entire reading of it before I return it to the library. Very boring read to start with. But that's me."
3,Cute,"I was a big fan of the Dear American Diaries and the Royal Diaries when I was younger. This adaptation includes three short episodes: Cleopatra, Elizabeth I, and Isabelle of Castille. The acting really isn't bad, and neither are the story lines. The costumes and settings are quite believable, but the music score leaves something to be desired. I did wish accents were present in the Cleopatra episode. These are brief stories about girls who could not just be carefree teenagers, but had to face serious situations while still quite young. Perhaps these films would be useful for educational purposes--a theatrical glimpse of real historical figures."
2,Weirdest CD ever,"I don't understand how a CD can have such weird songs together on it. There are a few that are Jesus-y. Then, some with Pooh. Then, one that's creepy cause it's this guy talking about finding a wife and ""she's a young thing and cannot leave her mother"".HATE THIS CD!!! Too bad my 3 year old enjoys it."
1,Not for kids,"I bought this CD because I was expecting it to contain music for young chilren but if I'd had a listen to it would have left it on the rack.I don't know why they call it pooh bear to start with, since only about 2 songs are pooh related. Most of the songs seem to be sung by donald duck or goofy, the donald duck ones are impossible to understand and the goofy ones have stupid comments thrown in all through the songs.And then there are the ones which are totally inapporpriate for children, for example 'Where a bum can stay for many a day and he don't need any money....' now how on earth did that make it onto a pooh CD?Save your child and get a decent CD."
2,"""NOT EXACTLY"" a Stylus Gauge","Just got this little made in China jem in the mail!To be honest this is ""NOT"" what it says it is.IT IS A ""ELECTRONIC MINI POCKET SCALE"" (SEE BOX)that can measure up to 50g.Yea it will measure your stylus pressure but you would never know that from the box or the lack of Stylus Gauge instructions provided. The scale instructions are very crudely written and not helpful."
4,Impact Screwdriver,"This tool was purchased to be able to remove corroded deck screws from a redwood deck -- it has been ten years since the deck was built and the galvanized screws had become somewhat corroded and impossible to remove using a drill with a phillips bit or a hand screwdriver. I was moderately successful using a hammer and regular screwdriver, but it was a lot of work and many of the screws would break. I found that the Olympia impact screwdriver made removing screws a far easier chore. It usually required about four taps with a two pound hammer to completely loosed the screw. From there I used a drill with a phillips bit to finish removing the screw. I have found that the bit needs replacing after removing about 150 screws and the greatest problem that I have is locating a source for the bits -- they are much bigger and more heavy duty than the ordinary 1/4 inch screwdriver bits. The tool works as advertised, but it took a little limbering up to get the mechanism working smoothly."
2,only for bose,"this product I guess, is ok with Bose products only. Not worth a darn for any other use"
5,Exactly what the doctor ordered!,"After a recent house move I was forced to try and ""hide"" the surround sound wires for my LifeStyle 35 system rear speakers between the baseboards and carpet. This worked well until my youngest son started crawling and pulled the wires up.After much searching around I decided that this system would be best and I am not disappointed. For owners of a Bose system, this is a snap to install. It comes complete with connections to your Acoustimass module, and new wires to connect from the remote unit to your speakers. No need to cut or strip wires and even has the right connections for Lifestyle ""cube"" speakers.Without doubt, this is a perfect system when used as designed, within a decent-sized room for a home theatre system. My receiving unit is approximately 15 feet from the broadcast unit."
3,"Works as well as wired, but the price is a joke","The BOSE SL2 maintains the quality that you expect from your BOSE system when it's a wired connection. It hides easily behind my couch and I've had no problems. The reason for the 3 stars is the price. There is no way this product should cost over 200 dollars. The technology involved just doesn't cost that much, and if it does BOSE has some serious supply chain issues they need to workout. They amount of tech you can get for 200 bucks nowadays is breathtaking and a wireless audio transmitter and receiver no matter how good does not cost 200 bucks. Shame on you BOSE."
3,Average,"Its not exactly wireless as the speakers and the unit have to be connected togther and also to the power outlet. Also the sound from the rear speakers seems a bit weak compared to the front and centre speakers.Anil - Dec 22, 2011"
1,Warning--Must have Bose system for this to work!,"You can't hook up this system unless you have a bose system/receiver in place. I saw a review on another site that suggested this would work with my Onkyo receiver, but after buying and attempting to install the system I found out the hard way. Confirmed this is true with Bose customer service. Now I'm going to be penalized a 15% restocking fee and shipping fees with 6th Ave. Electronics. Sweet Deal!"
3,Won't work on some Accoustmas systems,"I have an old Accoustmas 5 system. This wireless system does not work with it. I gave it three stars even though I haven't used it because I don't want to say anything negative about the SL2. If you order this, make sure it works with your system before ordering it. In the past I have sent a speaker in to Bose for repair and called them about other products they sell. Their customer service is EXCELLENT, & they are in America - A GREAT AMERICAN COMPANY!!"
3,Good sound but still requires speaker wire,"I agree with the previous reviewer that while the sound quality is good, you still need to run speaker cables to each speaker. I found another unit that has separate receivers for each speaker: [...]"
3,bose sl2,"the wireless connection works great.i do not know if this powers off when the bose system is off. there is no switch. i hope it does, because if it does not, then it might be draining power.i wish bose will install a volume control to this device. i have seen it in other wireless speaker connections (like rocketfish) and this was a very useful feature. yes, i know that bose has adaptik, but some manual control does not hurt.finally, i wish the seller would have provided a way to track the package. i knew they had shipped it, but not being able to track it's progress provided some anxiety."
3,Work good,These speakers work good but you must have a Bose receiver for them to work to their full extent. Had to jury rig them to work with an older receiver.
4,Bose SL2,Easy install on my Bose system in new house with no easy options for connecting rear speakers. I can distinguish no loss of sound quality when compared to wired setup at old location. Cost seems high. Could not tell if I could install additional SL2 for the rear speakers in the other rooms connected to the Lifestyle system. It would also be helpful if Bose would offer wireless connection (full signal to support all speaker sets and acoustimas units) in additional rooms for the older Lifestyle systems (e.g. Lifestyle 50).
4,An excellent resource...,"If you're stuck in a ""kitchen work triangle"", then you're stuck in the 1950's. This book is all about adapting your kitchen to work for your type of cooking, baking and/or entertaining.Outstanding concepts presented on refrigerators: i.e. side-by-side and how to put one in your kitchen properlyA bit short on tips such as these, however. Left me wanting more (without paying $500 for his services).Would've appreciated more examples, especially any examples (or pros/cons) of putting the cooktop/prep area on an island.Overall, well recommended."
5,A Must-Read!,Kitchen Design with Cooking in Mind is a must for anyone planning to create or remodel their kitchen. Reading it will help avoid costly mistakes and make the right decisions. I can't praise it enough--it's full of great ideas and incredible photos. I have heard Mr. Silvers lecture AND have enjoyed sampling his phenomenal cooking--both of which are testimonials to his expertise.
3,inspiring but too short,"This book can be quite inspiring to folks who don't have any idea where to start on a kitchen design or remodel. It would make an excellent introduction and first chapters in a much larger reference book on the subject -- if the author would only take the time to catalog his experiences as a ""Certified Kitchen Designer"" with examples of real world problems and solutions, in addition to just selling his services as a CKD/Chef. I thought the ""celebrity endorsements"" were just unnecessary fluff. Edic's ""Kitchens That Work: The Practical Guide to Creating a Great Kitchen"" would be a good addition to help fill in the gaps from this good but unfortunately short book."
3,Very Readable But Lacking On Details,"I enjoyed reading Kitchen Design with Cooking In Mind. It was an easy and quick read. I do recommend reading it if you are designing a kitchen, but temper your expectations. Silvers Has some solid ideas; 1) 30"" deep counters 2) multiple sinks for both prep and cleanup 3) modular cabinets have a baked on catalytic finish that can't be matched, and a few more important points. What I didn't like was the fact that it was short on details and does not cover some very basic topics. Silvers barely mentions kitchen islands and the options and advantages that come with them. He also does not cover important topics such as optimal spacing of islands, and or peninsulas to minimize wasted travel while not limiting the flow of when two or more cooks helpers sharing the space."
1,Self promotional book that reads like a infomercial,"Better information is available in current magazines on kitchen design. Most of the book is devoted to promoting his services; promotional brochures should be free. He suggests you make detailed lists of where to locate everything in the kitchen, and then suggests not having a built-in processor/ blender because it isn't moveable. Doesn't stand to reason that if all ingredients are at your finger tips you wouldn't have to move your blender? Found much of the information common knowledge for 2004 (2 sinks and dishwashers) and too general to be helpful for specific design. I returned the book!"
4,Classic Trance,The world's top DJs have used tracks created by Transa to envoke emotions native to the trance genre.
1,Que Juego Mas Basura,"Hey tenia que comentar este juego que compre casi por accidente y que es una verdadera perdida de tiempo, LA JUGABILIDAD, LOS GRAFICOS, ABSOLUTAMENTE TODO NO SIRVE.NO LO RECOMIENDO A NADIE."
1,Total disgrace to Playstation 2,"This game is total disgrace to Playstation 2. First of all the graphic. Don't be fooled by the picture-shot in the backcover or anywhere else, once you start the game, you'll notice the blurry and horrible graphics. The graphic in this game is Akklaim graphic style. Remember blurry graphic in Burnout (also by Akklaim), this game worst. In the cover, it said ""converted by Akklaim"" which mean Sega made this game and Akklaim convert it to horrible game. I should avoid it at the first time.Second, the road length is very short. No, it very very short. And it almost impossible to finish. What the point of all of this? Very short track and very difficult.I give this game 1 star because it don't have negative star. In the scale of 0 to 10, I will give this game (negative)-5 star. I purchased this game this afternoon and now I'm ready to sell it back."
5,This will be a legend!!!,"I've only played 18 Wheeler in an arcade, with the big steering wheel, and the wide screen, and I have to say its one of the best games I've ever played. Its like Flight Sim except you are in an 18 Wheeler truck. The graphics are great, and the story line is ok. Its only down-feature is that fact that there are only five levels, but there is two player mode for even more fun and laughs. In my opinion, this is a must get game"
1,Dont even rent this game,"I feel like I was ripped off and I only rented this game. I had played the demo version for the Dreamcast and loved it.Somehow Acclaim found a way to ruin this great arcade game. It is almost impossible to finish a race even on the easy settings. I dont know what happened but they made this way too hard which makes it unplayable. This PS2 version is garbage and should be avoided at all costs. I would throw this game out, but I have decided to go return it to the video store so some other sucker can waste their six bucks. I wish I could give it zero stars."
1,Really bad,"I rented this and had to double check the box to make sure I got the PS2 game. The graphics are only OK for PS1, awful for PS2.It's not fun either. I was looking forward to smashing stuff with a big truck. You get time taken off the clock for hitting cars, and you'll never finish in the time allowed.If you don't want to have fun and just race, it's way too short. I went from NY to FL in a few minutes.You'd be better off getting ANY of the other driving games for PS2."
2,Not Impressed!,"18 Wheeler is only a very average game at best. I am a big fan of all racing games, but the action in this game is too SLOW to keep me interested. After playing through a couple of levels, I was bored with this game.The graphics do not live up to the Playstation 2, in fact this game looks more like a Playstation one game.If you enjoyed the arcade game, you may like this, but I would recommend renting this before buying it."
1,B-B-B-BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,At first this game looked pretty cool racing around the country and all but it is NOT! All you do is drive a truck. There's no fun in it at all. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! If you really likr good racing games DONT get this one!!!!!!
3,It's a bilge pump nothing more.,"Not a whole lot to say. All around average performer. I use these in my bait tank on the boat and I average at least one per year. I wish they had better bearings. It's not the motor that wears out in these. You might think after all these years of building them, Rule could toss a couple of ball bearings in there. They don't want to because they sell more pumps this way. 3 stars. Seller did a great job packing and shipping and somehow when I bought them, the price was set at $20.xx, which was cheaper than the 3' wire standard model that was going for 22.xx at the time."
5,Great!,"This is a great camera! I spend a lot of time outdoors and have had many cameras ruined (by other people) from getting wet or dropped. It really is waterproof and the pictures come out great. I haven't taken any underwater photos but i have put the camera underwater and it still works.Pros: Small, 7.1MP, good shutterspeed, waterproof, shock-proof, large viewing screen, easy to useCons: Only digital zoom, not the smallest camera on the market."
1,The little cars in the great race,The Little Cars in the Great RaceWe never got to see the contents of this DVD as both the original and the replacement were defective so never watched them.
1,PART OF A NEW TREND - CHEAP MOVIE RIPOFFS,"This phenomenon has been in the news recently. There are companies springing up that as soon as they hear of the next blockbuster, start production on cheap ripoffs with confusingly similar names.They rely on their similarities to prey on people thinking it is a sequel or even the real deal.I'm sorry to see Amazon confusing their customers and helping these companies stay in business."
1,And I thought barney was horrible.,This is by far the worst childrens dvd I have ever seen. The graphics are pathetic. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,"Horrible, horrible movie!","thank goodness I rented this movie at a Red Box, for $1.00! It was the worst cartoon film I have ever seen. My 3 yr old grandson liked it for 5 minutes, then he wanted me to put in the ""real cars movie"", but we watched it all of this movie to see what is what about...yawn...30 minutes of pure garbage!!!I found it to be very mean, spiteful, and then it had suggestive and lewd comments that were just awful. Never buy this film, and never rent it either! well, unless you have nothing better to do, and you can find it for a $1.00, hey maybe it can used for target practice...shoot it!"
1,craptastic,"ok, I watched the whole movie and it is half hour long. I rated this 1 out of 5, because it is a terrible ripoff of Pixar Cars, The CGI animation was crap, the storyline is boring and the voices are annoying. The scenes were boring, I almost fell asleep. I would never recommend this to any hardcore Disney fans. Please get Pixar Cars instead."
1,And now for the bad/good list...,The bad:-Obvious Cars rip-off-Terrible voice acting-CGI that makes old PS1 games look like PS3 quality-Annoying characters-The cars wheels don't move-Pixar should sue thier butts off for this-Not original-Looks cheap-Unfunny-Ogly-No personality or charm-Dumb-Boring-No speed-dumb innuendos-No plot (no interesting plot)-Bad lip-syncing-Look lik a video game-terrible and annoying music-painful to watchThe good:-Errrr...Ummm...Well...it was never in theatres???
1,Horrible.,I got this dvd because my son loves the Disney movie Cars. I put it in to watch myself to see what it is like. It was poorly made. Really bad graphics. I put it on for my 3 year old to see and he asked me to turn it off and didn't want to see it lol! I would NOT buy this one.
1,Sucks Hardcore,A total ripoff of Disney's Cars. You shouldn't buy this and Disney should sue! It was horrible.
4,warchild,This is a great read! action from the first page. It's taken me to another realm. Love the characters.
5,Gripping tale,"Others have done a good job of summarizing the story, so I won't say more about that. I found the book very well written. The story was mesmerizing and haunting it really did stay with you. Jos was a very sympathetic character and I look forward to reading more about him in the later books."
4,Wicked good first novel!,"For a first novel, this book is amazing. I thought she did a great job created a future and a setting for this story, as well as an amazing job with the strit's (the aliens the human government is in conflict with).I really liked the main character Jos and his mentor Niko and thought the villian, Falcone was written solidly as well. I recommend this book for people who like space science-fiction books with solid action and well written character development."
3,This reads like FanFic,"It's not a bad book. But it isn't highly original, either. I understand that it may be difficult to imagine an entire alien culture, simply for the fact that the alien is too alien to be imagined by terrestrians. On the other hand, if I as a reader recognize the described alien culture as vaguely Japanese on first sight, it's disappointing and seems like authorial laziness to me.And although fantasy stories like this live off the small details the writer manages to incorporate, it would be helpful if said details would at least, you know, work. Imagining a kind of mummy-wrap topped by a swinging cloak as main garment of the alien culture sounds cool, but would be cooler, if it were at least possible to do such a wrap for people who sport wings between their wrists and waist, just saying.I will resell my copies (have the whole trilogy), because I can't imagine I will want to re-read them anytime soon. I can find this quality of reading material on the web for free."
3,"Interesting Premise, Weak Main Character","The plot line for this book is kind of a cross between Cherryh's Downbelow Station and Heinlein's Citizen of the Galaxy, with a bit of Christopher Rowley's The Black Ship thrown in. The author tries to follow the life of an orphan (by implication the Warchild) as he passes through various environments. But she seems to keep forgetting that he is (as things progress) eight to fourteen years old. The novel is presented from this characters viewpoint, and his thoughts and observations are usually much to adult if you really think about them.Not a bad first outing, but not great either."
2,"Why, why why?","As a debut novel the book exceeds expectations. It has action, suspense and a generally well thought out plot.The book tells the story a young boy on a starship that is attacked by pirates and captured. ... If I see another book by this author I will be a very reluctant reader if that."
2,Check the facts before you settle in on an opinion please.,Interesting tail. Not all together accurate however. I would be nice if she had contacted the family about some of the facts before assembling this.I'd recommend googling Zeke Flora and reading the transcripts and documents before you make your opinion.
5,Long Lasting - 14 years!,"I bought the Nail Genie Professional years ago when I was pregnant for my son. I loved the convenience of having it at home to use, I even used it on my toe nails! lol Anyway, my son is now 14 years old and it just now stopped working. That's why I'm on here looking to buy another. I feel you can't go wrong, it's a good product."
2,Maybe quality is slipping?,"I had one of these machines that I loved and lasted years. I replaced it recently, and though I've had it a while now, it really hasn't been used that many times, and has already broke. The plastic collar that holds the drill bits is practically crumbling apart. In looking up if there is a way to replace that part, I came across these reviews, and it makes me wonder if the quality of this product is slipping. Anyway, apparently, the only way to replace this little nothing part is to send the entire unit back to the company, and let them determine what is wrong with the machine. It does not appear that I can just purchase the part I need. I find this to be more of a hassel than it's worth for a machine that wasn't that cheap and lasted so short of a time. I will say the power is good on it, but I think I'm going to look to see if there are good reviews on a cheaper unit, and cut my losses with this one."
3,Hand piece does not last long.,"I have bought several of these over the course of 23 years. In the past, when the hand piece died, as it inevitably does, it use to be a nominal fee to have it repaired. Now, they make you buy a new one. The hand piece either has an internal malfunction or the cord shorts out. I find this irritating because it happens within a year or two of use. I have since upgraded to better machines that are comparable in cost. But before buying the newer/better machines, I did purchase another one of these. They have upgraded it...they say. So we'll see how this one goes. The one pictured here is not the latest model.FYI, I do my own acrylics and use this for pedicures as well. I have more than one home so I like to have one at each residence. I do not abuse it...just normal routine use on myself."
1,Where's the helpful information?,"This book didn't have much specific, practical advice- I mean, everyone knows that if you eat fewer calories and exercise more you'll lose weight, right? Some people must find it motivating to read 100 stories stories about other people losing weight, but I don't have a lot of time on my hands and prefer to get the main points without all the fluff in between. (Every case study went something like, ""Janeane ate a lot while she was pregnant and gained 30 pounds. After having the baby, she ate less and exercised more and lost the weight!"" No duh!)"
2,"Beautifully written, but...","This book is beautifully written and I love the descriptive prose, but I couldn't get past the first one hundred pages. I think it was clever the way the author displayed thw text for dreams in a different font..at first. I soon found that I couldn't tell when Bertrand was dreaming or not. I'm sure the author did this intentionally, but after page 100, I just got tired of it. I became so tired of the long, drawn out, discriptive dreams. There wasn't enough interaction between the characters for me. I tried to hold on and finish the book, but I couldn't. I peeked forward on some of the pages, but all I saw was more drawn out dreams. To me, it was repetitive."
1,Recommended for insomniacs,"One of the previous reviews, defensive, spiteful and jealous in tone - Colson Whitehead really IS all that - reads as though it was written by the author himself. Anyone who reads Black Issues Book Review magazine knows what's hot and what's not in the black literary world. As it is, the title of this book very aptly describes what happens when any reader of the male gender picks it up and tries to read it: HE SLEEPS. This one should be recommended for insomniacs."
1,Try the titles below for black-oriented themes,"""The Emperor of Ocean Park"" by Stephen L. Carter and ""John Henry Days"" by Colson Whitehead are truly outstanding books by black male authors. And, of course, anything by Pulitzer Prize winner and MacArthur ""Genius"" Awardee James Alan McPherson is highly recommended, especially ""Hue and Cry"" and ""Elbow Room""."
1,Follow Up To The Previous Review,"Colson Whitehead, a recommended author, was today announced a winner of a MacArthur ""Genius"" Fellowship. Readers should definitely check out his two novels, ""The Intuitionist"" and ""John Henry Days"", two brilliant novels from this young newcomer to the black literary scene."
3,Somewhat helpful,"I thought the book was generally pretty good. It was very simplistic and it took a while to actually get into anything that was really interesting about LiveMotion. I was disappointed that it didn't deal a little more in depth with animation and effects as that's what can really spice up a web site. If you already have Adobe products the first half or so is review because LiveMotion integrates so well with the rest of Adobe's product line. If you an absolute beginner at Adobe products this book is good, otherwise, wait for another to be published"
3,Very Basic and a little Premature,"I have used the SAMS Teach Yourself approach for several different subjects in web development. For the most part they are very good. I ordered this book before it was published and waited patiently for it to come. In the meanwhile i honed my Flash skills. I got the bok as soon as it was available last year, I am just sittng down with it now. After going through the first half, I feel this book could have used a little more editting and quality control. THere are references made to tools and settings that are not where the book says they are, as early on as the explanation of the settings! The book also assumes that you have covered areas early in the book when infact, they have never been addressed before. Like I said, this book is good for beginners, but be ready to do some searching of your own so you do not get lost."
2,Teach is not the right title,"I have a few Sam's Teach Yourself books. Some I like and some are just dust collector, but this is the first time in a long time I could not wait to return a book.I learn better when I see how others have used a program--the learn from the Master's feet kind of thing. Well Molly I must say that there was less teaching and more show and tell here.This book takes the User Guide you get with the program and adds several layers of text to it. Book has already gone back so there will be no quotes--It was like having a Calc teacher explaining how to add. Too much on what an elipse is and nothing for me to learn from--you know like homework. I need to do something to actually learn-like classroom in a book. My next purchase from the refund I am getting from this book."
1,a steal,this book teaches nothing about Livemotion animation capabilities.371pages and only 2pages on pen tool and 12pages on the main strenght of LiveMotion the Timeline animation very very deceiving stay away.
4,The first Book!,"My review for the Live motion book is that it is pretty good but it can be a little more ""Instructional"" But a good buy. So i would get it because its the only one out now."
3,There is nothing bad to say about this book,"As one of the reviewers said already, Roberts portreys Conan as a barbarian who is more civilized than the so called ""noble"" people that surround him. That aspect is shown in every one of Roberts novels. In my opinion he is the only author that does not destroy the image of Conan that was created by Robert Ervin Howard.In this book Conan travels far south to recover mysterious treasure of Python. Less you know about this book, will make the reading more interesting....Very Highly recommended"
3,Conan the Ape,"Amen to killercroc. JMR does capture the personality of Conan better than anyone since Robert Howard. This, however, is not one of JMR's best. It's been about three months since I read this book and I can only vaguely remember what it was about. I had to look it up on line for a reminder. I would still recommend it as a solid entry into the Conan saga. Again, as long as Conan keeps on moving through the world Howard created, opening that world up to us with each unfolding chapter, then you will be a satisfied reader."
4,Conan and the Treasure of Python,"Simply put, I liked it. Roberts is one of the few writers who makes Conan work for me. This story felt like I was reading King Solomans Mines as it followed the same story line but had all the things that make Conan what it is. I recomend all of Roberts Conan books for I haven't read any I didn't like. With sword and sorcery to pirates and supernatural you can't go wrong."
2,Interesting concept.. but stick with the originals.,"I'll keep this short and sweet.. I used to have a typical Dunlop capo, but lost it at one point during a move from Michigan to California. I decided to pick this up at a nearby store -- the design was interesting, seemed like it'd work pretty well... unfortunately, I was mostly wrong. The design is nice, and definitely doesn't look as bulky as a regular capo, and the ratcheting is a good concept as well. The biggest problem -- it doesn't fit with various neck types, and as a result, a lot of the time only 5 out of 6 strings will be held down... but for those that ARE held down, they aren't exactly held down very well. Stick with the original capo designs."
3,1959-79 projects on 14 color & 150 b/w illustrations,"A monograph on Moore surveying his projects done between 1957 and 1979 from 14 color photos and 150 b/w illustrations. Included are plans, elevations, other drawings, notes, credits, and chronology. It has 128 pages, cloth binding, dust jacket, and is sized 9.5"" x 9.25""."
2,Meh. Nothing Special...,"Could of been a lot worse I guess, but I'm not shedding any tears over the show's quick cancellation. The problems with the show is that it tries that formula of mixing quirky family humor for the grown ups with cheap gags for the kiddies but it becomes just one big mess. Also, the children are pretty horrible characters, there's nothing to empathize with especially since they look SO modelled over market research. (Perhaps a comment of the shallow nature of the current video game industry? Unlikely.) They're just smug and self-absorbed but always painted as better people than the parents in the show. UPN's way of trying to be hip I guess. Patrick Warburton is the saving grace of the series and I guess there's a few game references in the first couple of episodes to validate your taste. In the end, nothing really memorable about this series."
5,Extremely entertaining!,"We just rented this video and found it to be one of the best written shows we've seen in a long time. It's a shame it's not still running. As parents of teenagers, we found the humor quite funny yet it was pretty clean. You can safely watch it with a ""tween"" / teen. The NR rating was a bit daunting so we pre-screened some of it first and found it tamer than most PG/PG13 shows."
4,Drawing The Line Review,"If you have an interest in American Colonial history and/or the profession of surveying, this is interesting reading."
4,Valuable insight,"LOved part, others not so much. She's very good on politics but she lost me on some of the cultural items. Overall, they're great first-person history"
1,Very Unhappy with Amazon,"I paid extra to get the item early and didn't receive it when informed I would. I bought it for my father to wear for the game and didn't receive it till after the game which at that time was pointless. Moreover, to pay extra to get the t-shirt early and when I called I was not met with any type of courteousness. I was basically told ""oh well, Its not our fault"". This leads me to never shop with amazon because I felt misled and taken!"
5,Medicinal Plants,Michael is one of the best in Herbalogy and has a wonderful way of discribing what each herb is all about in simply to understand language.
4,"Egyptian Talent, ""Lounge"" Feel","This has fun, modern interpretations of Arabic music. But, not everyone appreciates modern interpretations of music. Some modernization of Middle Eastern music makes this easy to listen to. And there are some really wonderful compositions that grace this CD.Mohammed Abdul-Wahab was trying to blend a bit of Eastern music with Western, to make it a bit more up to date. He had more than 250 songs to his credit before his death, and had very clear talent.If you like your ethnic music to be ""pure,"" without any modern interpretations, you will probably not care for this. However, if you are not such a stickler, this is a great CD."
3,A little disappointed,"I bought this CD primarily because of the first piece ""Zeina"", which is a piece used in my belly-dance class. I generally like Hossam Ramzy's music, but didn't really feel that way with this CD."
4,So cute,"I bought this for my car because I love hello kitty. This is a very cute sign and the head bobbles back and forth well. The only complaint is that I wish the head part was a little stronger, but it probably needs to be weaker to go side to side."
3,"Hello Kitty ""Baby in the Car"" sign","I love Hello Kitty! I loved the fact that the sign came with a sticker so u could change it from ""baby in the car"" to ""child in the car"". But...the silly thing won't stay stuck to the window! Very disappointing!"
1,volviendo a lo mismo,reggeton con el propheta 2 saco el primero una basura despues estuvo llorando con lagrimas ahora biene a sacar mas basura mera compai retirese si lo de usted no la ase pol favor no estes poniendo a los verdaderos representantes del genero del reggaeton por el piso con tus polquerias gracias
5,The secret to a healthy body,Everyone should read this book. We cannot avoid getting older but we don't have to feel old at the same time. To keep your body in excellent condition follow the advice contained in this book.
5,It's an OUTSTANDING BOOK!!!!!!!!!!,My second grade teach has this book and I really like it. It's my favorite poetry book I've read so far and now I want to write poetry too! This is the first book I ever went to the bookstore to find and buy. You will love it if you read it. Happy reading!
4,Best CD you will buy if you're looking for salsa to dance to,Includes super hits Persona Ideal and Arrepentida. These talented young Venezuelan artists perform salsa like no one in today's generation of romantic salsa. The CD is well recorded and will appeal to anyone who likes to dance. All the songs on the CD would be enough to get any party going. There is even one song that starts out as a bolero and then quickly becomes a danceable tune. I think this CD will be one of the better purchases you can make.
1,disappointed,"disappointed, i followed reviews of fans when trying this band. i saw that they toured with Dream Theater and was expecting at least an iota of progressive elements! however, these guys are so aggressive that they should be in an asylum rather than a studio!"
5,one of the best,"at the time i didnt know the history behind this band. tommy, their vocalist, used to sing for From Here on and played guitar for the great Prayer for Cleansing. this cd is flat out crazy. brutal heavy breakdowns can do from blast beat, to a soft part or even complete silence. everything about this cd is great. i cant even go into detail how great it is. mordecai is one of the greatest songs ever written."
5,"amazing band, one of my favorite bands","what can I say about this amazing band. JUst crazy and really good. They switch stuff up so much and they are really good at all the different styles they play. The heavy parts are technical,heavy and good. and the slow parts are dreamy, catchy,emotional, and just really good also."
5,This isn't even my scene,"This album... wait... this band pretty much owns everyone in the talent department. This is pretty much one of the most well put together albums I've ever heard... and I don't usually like stuff this heavy. First of all... everyone in the band has a copywrite on their instruments... and no one else should be allowed to play anything after what these guys do. The drummer is pretty much insane... and owns the double bass. The guitarists play some of the most retarded chord progressions and make them sound amazing. Insanely technical. The singer has one of the widest ranges I've heard... deep growls(which I'm not a fan of), high pitched screams, an amazingly beautiful melodic singning voice. On top of all this are pretty good lyrics and an insane live performance... if you don't know about BTBAM yet... you need to get to know them"
1,Stirring your brains (subliminal wooden spoon),"Have any of you hardcore fans (or any fans of music with a good amount of screaming) ever seriously thought about how stupid it is. I thought the point of music was to take your mind off the chaos in the world, or open your eyes to it, not to be punched in the head so many times you cannot make out your face and your eardrums burst.Grow some common sense on your sorrow and pity tree"
4,Great Album,"May I just say, the preciseness of the guitars/growling/screaming/singing is great. These guys really know how to pull it off! I especially was blown away by the awesome guitars on this album. So if you have the chance pick this album up."
3,"good metal, but softer parts have to go","This album is very well done. It has some original touches here and there, but I don't think any of it is really all that new. It sounds like a lot of other metal-core albums, although it uses structures from extreme metal to a greater extent than any other hard-core album I've heard. It sounds like Extol (of whom I'm not really that fond) mixed with hard-core vocals. I enjoy the metal songs. My main complaint about the album is the softer parts, which I think seriously compromise the momentum of the album. Contrast is very important in metal-- you can't keep bashing peoples heads in non-stop-- and sometimes it can be used to great effect. But I find the contrasts here a little too jarring-- swearing and rage followed by sensitive crooning, I don't know, it's not a combination I think works very well. I like the softer parts in themselves, but when put next to very heavy technical metal, they seem a little silly."
4,hardcore death-metal emocore!!!,"i haven't heard of blend of styles like this since mr. bungle.definitly one of the better hardcore bands i've heard (though i'm not a huge fan of the gutteral growl). they put the locust to shame, but don't quite hold a candle to dillenger. their melodic stuff is actually quite good, sometimes better than the hardcore stuff (the last song on this cd is amazing). the bonus track is quite humorous, as well as quite good.if you like hardcore and/or death metal, you should probably pick this one up. if you like emocore, you can try it...you probably won't like ALL of it, but you may like some of it."
2,Another Parkerized CD,"By the way,what happened to all the reviews that were here a few weeks ago? Why were they deleted? I was really looking forward to this CD because the few tracks of Gracie I heard on the radio were delightful. This CD has been put through a weird ""stereo"" process that makes it sound like she is in one studio and the orchestra is in another distant one. Her voice is given tremendous echoey promanence and the orchestra can hardly be heard. To me the sound is unpleasant and nothing like the original recordings. I have another ""Parkerized"" CD of Helen Kane (the model for Betty Boop) that was equally disappointing in exactly the same way.I have just ordered what I hope is a non-parkerized CD of Gracie Fields (Sing As We Go,Vol 1). I wish Amazon would alert us to which CD's of pre-stereo music have been put through this weird attempt to ""modernize"" the sound."
3,3 or 4 stars,"I have a hard time deciding between giving this book 4 stars for a well written and engaging story or 3 stars for a premise I disagree with completely.I think that women have the capacity to be as vicious and violent as men if given the opportunity. In a society, where there are no men to compete for and/or define ourselves against, I think that women would become competitive and vicious with one another. Violent and socipathic women often hide these characteristics and try to fit the expectation of what women are supposed to be in our society. Time and again we hear of women who murder their husbands, who engage in horrific forms of child abuse and who do great violence against other women. Given a society where women are given permission to fight for power and success, I think women would develop this latent side to them."
5,This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read.,"The Disappearance is one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. It clarifies the differences and similarities between men and women. With a few minor adjustments, it is as appropriate today as when it was written. I regret that I loaned it to a friend and it was never returned. I'd love to find another copy."
5,A MUST READ FOR EVERY GENERATION,"I was part of the innocent pre me-generation of the chrome and fins 50's. I was attending high school in Miami Beach and this book magically found it's way into my life. It was my first awareness that, indeed, male and female existed on two different planets - both one and the same. Then and there, I became determined to know my way around a tool box and to imagine survival without men. Shortly after reading the last page, Mr. Wylie visited our high school and I, awash in adulation escorted him through our school. I have not forgotten his book and I have not forgotten him. And to his honor, I am an artist with a screwdriver."
5,great blues,This is one of the best that Ms. Lasalle has put out. When you listen to it you think about Beale street in Memphis. If you don't like blues don't buy this one becouse it is low down Blues.
3,Just Okay,"There is no doubt that DLG was a revolutionary salsa group that mixed salsa, rap, raggae and other rythyms, but most of the songs on this cd are mediocre. With the exception of ""No Morira,"" ""Me Va Extranar,"" and the up-beat ""Sueltame,"" the rest of the songs are nice but get mundane after a while. The fusions of rap in the songs are nice and the improvisation parts of the songs are also well done, but the body of some of the songs are rather un-interesting. Huey has a great voice, and while his high notes add energy to the songs they can be a little annoying sometimes. The follow up album was considerably better."
5,"Great, took over 50% of my pain",Awesome for pains caused by chronic prostatitis. It takes 2-4 weeks to work properly and it's NOT cheap but it's worth it. I tried everything under the sun and finally used Q-Urol. It's the real deal and I would recommend 100%. Even my Urologist reviewed it.
2,Confused,"I am not sure about this product to tell you the truth, its very confusing, i will update you with the result soon, i am still testing whats happening"
5,I use this book with science activities about leaves.,Great Book for using with science experiments about autumn leaves.
4,My Kids Love It!,"This book is a must-read every autumn in our home and was purchased for us by Grandma who saw how enthusiastically one of her other grandchildren responded to it. When I surprised them with it last night at bedtime, (along with When Autumn Comes, also recommended) they hung on every word. This book is both colorful and educational and has become a ""classic"" seasonal book for our family. My daughters (now age 9) plan to read it to their 5-6 y/o school book-buddy this year. You can't go wrong with this selection."
3,The Leafy Review,I didn't really like this book. I wasn't ass colorful as other books. It mostly talked about leaves and trees. I didn't really explain much about how trees are formed and stuff like that.
2,Not what I expected,"I had a hard time with this item. It came out all the time and no matter how hard I tried, I could not get it to stay in place. I wouldn't recommend it unless you decide to sew it in."
3,Good but not perfect,"The popcorn is delicious no matter which one is purchased. I have only been disappointed with the last case I purchased of the sun dried tomato and that is mostly because of the amount of unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bag. When I went on the Oogies website and emailed the company about my feeling they never responded. I know not every kernel in a given bag will pop but I considered the amount in this particular case and the company not responding to their ""contact us"" on the website inexcuseable."
2,Not for USB powered equipment,"In short: Do not use if you need to power the device via USB. I purchased this in the hopes of daisy chaining two segments to reach my USB powered eyetv HD. No where on the packaging or web site did he say it could not be used to devices that require USB for power. I found out the hard way. One 16' cable would work. Two, forget it. The tech support was very prompt and courteous, but in the end I was left on the sucks to be you planet. Not sure if I will trust IOGEAR marketing/packaging in the future."
2,elevator musak,The music of Flamenco Dreams is the elevator musak version of already greatly sanitized for Western consumption flamenco.
4,Visit the Alhambra and read this book.,"My visit to the Alhambra in the summer of 2002 wouldn't have been the same, not even close, if I hadn't peeped into the curiosity shop in the Alhambra complex. The book was everywhere. The stories are short and captivatingly exotic. It was a good choice. I kept reading it during the next days of my trip through the south of Spain. And it helped me visualize more clearly the Alhambra, like a place with its own life and soul.I am thankful to this nicely written book because it helped me appreciate much better the beauty and history of the Alhambra."
4,Ed who? but have you seen the muscianswith him too?,"I discovered Ed Calle through the usual recommendations of my used-cd store I frequent. Ed who? but looking at Sandoval and others, I just had to try it.Funk there is (not my liking), good caribbean swings, and a saxo that shows you how it was meant to be played... Ideal for that am traffic hour."
3,Another Transportation Manual,The material in the book is fairly comprehensive but difficult to understand. The examples presented in the book do not provide enough direction for the variety of real world problems in transportation engineering. The book's vague language makes a larger variety of examples necessary.
2,Greatest Battles of Star Trek? Hardly!,"My son, who received this set for Christmas, called it a rip-off. Half of the videos have fewer battle scenes than a typical Star Trek episode. Any fan of any of the four Star Trek series will wonder from which cave the editor crawled out of who selected these episodes. Caveat Emptor! And I'd advise carefully examining any other Star Trek box sets from Viacom. It was a disappointment."
3,ok battles more like it,This is an ok set at best. The DS9 episdo and TOS are only real battle ones. Why they did NOT use best of both world for TNG I do not know. If you are trying to collect all them like me this helps.
4,Buy It for less!,"Great videos. Great price. Wish it were out on DVD! If you want to wait, there are cheaper sites."
5,It's an excellent pack!!! I love it!,"When I bought this product I wasn't really sure how it would be.However, I was studying English and I needed to improve my pronunciation and listening so I took the risk. It worth it!...It's an excellent book (and cds too). I recommend it to everyone.I listen to the cds every day :D .My mail is dalila_tm@hotmail.com"
4,Great book but not so many exercises to practice,You can learn a lot about pronunciation but there is not so many exercises to practice and audio quality of tracks is not so good. It's a good program for this price I think.
5,Great English Audio CD,This audio CD is worth every penny you paid for it. Way cheaper than other english audio CDs for the amount of material this contains. Great buy!
4,"Price is right, drain a bit of a mystery","We had a tight area where we needed a small sink, and the price on this was great. It fits fine and is working well.Our only problem is that the black piece that came with it kept falling off. We might try gluing it (perhaps that is what is intended - there are no instructions telling you to do that or what kind of glue to use) but in the meantime we are using wire to hold it on. A gray flexible ribbed washing machine hose fit well to the black piece for a drain, which we hooked over our toilet tank to reuse the water for flushing.The little tabs that came with the sink to hold it in place work very well. All in all, the only problem is the black piece, which as I said may be intended to be glued. Wish they had included some kind of instructions on that, so we would know for sure."
3,Partially pure,"One of the unintentionally frivolous group's better works, FM plays to Stewart's minimalist advantages, where sometimes all the over-dramatic artsy overkill actually feels legitimately complimented by starkly rendered, mainly acoustic compositions."
1,"Seriously, worst album Ive ever heard","This album is not art. Its not daring or bold. Its a worthless collection of mish-mashed, dissonate sound samples and idiotic lyrics that try much too hard to be edgy and provocative. The whole thing is so stupidly over-the-top it comes off as cheesy and, really, quite funny, if it wasnt so horrible to listen to. The pretentious rock critic crowd may love these guys but I highly doubt that anyone who actually likes to listen to, umm, music will find anything appealing."
3,Very basic - starter information,"100 was simply too many questions for the subject, perhaps 50 of the questions are really important to someone so ill they are considering a stem cell transplantOtherwise, as with the other title I purchased from this series, the book is clear, easy to read and worth the nominal purchase price"
3,"Good, if you know what you're doing",This is definetly a collection of case studies - but that's it. Do not expect much in the way of guidance with the studies. I would reccomend this book only if you are an experienced trainer and have a clear understanding of the group you are working with. The studies are strong and varied and can certainly add to an existing training program.
3,Unfortunately boring,"I was very excited to read this novel as both a great lover of Italy history and of Shelley's Frankenstein. However, this book really lost my interest about half way through. Shelley's writing is not up to par with her more famous work and the novel is hardly about the ""Life and Adventures of Castruccio"" and much more about two female characters. Oh well, it was worth a try."
2,BAD CHOICE OF ALBUM BUT JEZRO GREAT ARTIST,I HAD ANTICIPATED AN ALBUM BY JEZRO; THIS WAS NOT PERFORMED BY JEZRO ONLY PRODUCED BY HIM....I REALLY WANTED TO HEAR HIS VERSION OF THE FIFTIES' CLASSICS- ANOTHER REASON I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO HASTY.I WILL ORDER JEZRO ON STAGE DOING HIS OWN MUSIC LATER.BUY HIS MUSIC...GREAT JAZZ ARTIST AND MUSICIAN FROM WV WHOM WE KNEW AS A YOUNGSTER.OUR FAMILIES GREW UP AND WORKED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN SAME COUNTY.
4,Close to original equipment!,"Very good product. Fast shipping. Product packaging was excellent. Easy to install with good instructions. Only problem I encountered was the rubber grommet around the stem to base assembly, the factory grommet seemed to be heavier and fit better than the one that came with the product. So, I used the original grommet and I am very happy! Otherwise, I would have given a five."
3,Only OK,"I usually like Susan Wiggs but this book was missing something. The whole book felt rushed, from Sandra and Mike getting together to Sandra meeting Mike's kids to the surprise ending. The ending seemed almost as if the author was in a hurry and just tied everything up quickly. The storyline about Sandra's parents was out of place; it felt as though the author placed it in the book almost as an afterthought. I also felt that giving Sandra a stutter was somewhat lacking as a plot device. It evoked emotion in us for the child and the prison that stuttering created for her but I felt nothing for the adult. If you want to read an outstanding book where stuttering is used as a main plot device then ""The Duke and I"" by Julia Quinn is for you."
4,A Good Read,"Susan Wiggs almost never fails to deliver a good read. This book is another one.I quite enjoyed the story of the Black Widow of Blue Moon Bay. Lots of intrigue and waiting to find out what the real story was. Also, both Sandra and Mike seem to jump out from real life. They are not perfect people which makes their romance that more touching.All of the supporting characters are also fully-written out and entertaining in their own right.I highly recommend this book."
5,"funny, sad, true-to-life, uplifting","This is a book about people you care about and the drama that sweeps through their lives. There are many true-to-life moments in this, such as when Mike takes his daughter to a dance and it's all awkward, and when Sandy and her friend eat chocolate to make themselves feel better. Most of all, it is a love story that gives you hope that no matter how bad your troubles get, love will find you if you are willing to let it in."
4,One of Susan's best!,"A love story in a beautiful setting, plus a mystery with a twist to boot. What's not to like? I couldn't put it down; ended up reading it in one night. Great story-telling!"
4,Incredible compilation of traditional Tahitian music,"This is a compilation of a huge contest in Tahiti held every year. So there is a lot of variety on this cd, from pure percussion with the traditional slit drums, to singing. In particular, the ""Himene Tarava Tamarii Pirae"" is exciting, a large group of traditional singers with a very wonderful sound. If you have ever been to the Polynesian islands and want to recall the amazing music, this is a pleasing collection--is there really anything like Polynesian chanting and singing? Phenomenal."
2,Heiva i Tahiti,Seller was fast and great and the cd was in good shape. Didn't care for the cd. Sounded like a Tahitian Jamming session. Kept losing the beat. Not my fav.
1,Bad shipping,"Great videos. Shipping took FOREVER... I paid almost $18.00 in shipping for 6 videos, and it took about 3 weeks to get here =(.... I figured for that much in shipping, they would come priority, but they came parcel. I would not reccomend this seller unless you have a lot of time to wait."
2,My husband was not impressed,I bought this amp for my husband. He took it to a shop to have it installed. The guy told him this was not a good brand. I don't know much about these things but I do know that his system does not sound like it use to.
1,Poorly Written; Frustrating to Read,"This book is very poorly written. The amount of grammatical and spelling errors are driving me insane!! Not to mention I am finding some of the same technical errors mention in other reviews about this book. Did it even go through a review process (both technical and grammatical)???The one benefit of this book is the Sample Case Studies. I have used some other study materials and the wording and types of questions from this book appear to be inline with some of the other materials I have used.I am taking the test this weekend (10/27/2007). The majority of my study efforts have been with this book (reading it cover to cover), so I hope this has enough information to get me through the exam, but I am currently having doubts."
3,"Very nice, but I think I may be cured","This review is about me. I think I'm finally cured of trying to get in touch with the real Japan through its music. I think I became part of a bubble where people like me create a demand and other people, with the best of intentions, do their best to satisfy it, and together we float off to God knows where. I guess for me the bubble just burst. Partly what burst it was noticing how much supposedly traditional Japanese music consisted of variations on traditional melodies. It is possible that that's authentic, but I suspected it had more to do with the musicians than the music. It sowed doubts and pricked the bubble. All this is no fault of this fine recording."
4,japanese Flute,"G'day, I teach T'ai Chi and the sound work's well for my teaching.Cheers Joseph a bit over 13 hitting 74 and going well."
5,Drama Queen produces the best titles,"I've been a fan of Empty Heart for over a year, but I was wary when I saw the cover for Lies and Kisses. I didn't think anything could live up to the first, and the colors didn't look appealing. But I take it all back.Masara Minase's art is just gorgeous--beautiful modern lines, more clean, and long, yet realistic, like the higher quality art of mainstream manga. This second book didn't leave out any punches, satisfies with a love story, and that ""kink"" that every reviewer hints at here makes it very satisfying. She's gone on to include very slight ""chibified"" faces (only 3-4 in this volume and not overly exaggerated) and it adds to the characters rather than detracts.Drama Queen, as ever, finds and produces the best yaoi titles in English. The book is exactly the tankobon size with dust jacket and color inserts, the pages aren't too smooth or shiny or heavy, and feel just right."
2,Not what I expected...,"I had ordered this Hair N Cense to replace the one I bought from the same company a few years ago. I'm white, no dreadlocks, and I used the product to add moisture and help eliminate the fresh henna smell after coloring my hair.The delivery was prompt, bottle came securely packaged in a bubble wrap. However, the oil itself had a totally different smell, color and texture. No mango or lime resemblance whatsoever, just light minty fragrance that didn't last even an hour... Not sure if the company changed the ingredients, but the product I originally fell in love with wasn't in the bottle I had received. I'll have to give it away..."
2,My Review,This product smells really good but it didn't last once I applied it to my hair.The pump was also defective.
5,very useful!,"This book is very helpful for the people who knows nothing about programming. Unlike other matlab books,this one shows a lot basic functions in Matlab. Although it is a used book, it is very very clean!!!!"
5,The perfect introductory text for MATLAB,"If you are completely new to MATLAB then you will find no better book to guide you through the basics. It is perfectly suited for teaching yourself several basic but still very interesting and useful programming techniques. Topics are presented to the reader in an order carefully determined to produce maximum benefit and knowledge. The book is short and very readable, with many example programs.In short: if you want a FIRST introductory textbook for MATLAB, you can't beat this book. And it covers the latest version (Release 14)."
1,Wrong Item,Very disappointing... Instead of model 6Y160M0 (160Gb SATA) I received model 6Y080L0 (80Gb IDE). How could possibly someone make this so stupid mistake?
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,The previous review is obviously from the seller. This thing is a piece of garbage. There is nothing commercial about the quality of this. My clothes are bending the pole and the extensions can't hold more than 5 or 6 lightweight shirts. I wouldn't have paid half the price if I had seen it first. One more thing- the wheels in the photos are not what you get. You get cheap plastic wheels that do not roll well and will break. Save your money. (I don't know if the seller would take it back or not so I can't comment on their reurn policy. I'm too lazy and don't have the time to mess with the aggrivation.)
4,Ok for the price,"It is an ok product for the price. If you put too many cloths on it, the plastic clamps slide down and the rack collapses."
1,Unquality,I got it clutch disc two spring already been scratch and disc loosing ! Seem in storage long time . I don't like this kind businese ! Can't be trusted
1,Please don't buy this,"Although they try to avoid revealing it...most of the vignettes in this picture are poorly disguised and poorly acted reenactments of what I presume to be actual crime scenes and scenarios. The ""acting"" is completely obvious and is insulting to behold. I feel completely ripped off.For better insight into police procedures (not to mention a good deal more credible action), just watch an episode of Cops on Fox. I mean it, you will be sorry if you buy this dvd!"
4,West Coast Charm and Adult Developmental Issues,"The first two thirds of the book should be a joy to women who have had real relationships and professional careers, and survived after having lost such. The last third is chilling because of the 'bomb theme'. I suspect negative reviews are generated by people under 30 who simply haven't lived much (yet). Plus it might be hard to appreciate the tone of consumer excess and obsession if you never lived in California or a major metropolitan area."
2,Most of it ruminating about two failed marriages,"Forced myself through this because of high praise. Less than a post-nuclear war book but more of a chick book, most of it ruminating about two failed marriages. No plot."
3,Wait 'till you read the ending!,"When I picked up the book and read the first few chapters, I thought that this was going to be a nice light summer reading. I was right; living in Los Angeles made reading it even more enjoyable, since that is where it's set. My opinion changed drastically when I got to the end of the book and the book changed drastically. The end of the book is so shocking and... wacky, I think is the only word to describe it. By the end of the book, I didn't really care what happened to the characters because I was just so disjointed and the writing didn't interest me. This book is a unique reading experience."
3,"golden days, (used)","I didn't get exactli the edition in the ilustration, i gat a not-so-nice one but is ok, it got here fast and in great condition."
2,Minorly interesting book has majorly bad ending.,"I felt at home with the Los Angeles setting and the strange cult-like feel of the novel. I was into the characters, their dreams, their struggles. But the whole book I had been deceived! I didn't really understand the reality of this novel. I only read it on the surface. I do not blame myself for this. The plot was confusing and misleading. The relaxed tone of the main character caused me not to take the story too seriously. Therefore, the ending ""blew"" my mind. I wasn't expecting such a depressing read on my summer vacation, and if I could turn the clocks back in time, I would have chosen a different book."
1,disappointing,"I was reluctant to purchase this DVD due to Amazon's new policy of not listing the contents of CD/DVD's. If the contents were listed, I never would have purchased it.The only reason I did purchase it was because it was by the Morman Tavernacle Choir, which I love. This Christmas Concert contains none of the traditional/classic beautiful Christmas music you expect from this melodious Choir. In addition to very vew Christmas songs by the Choir (or any other music), the DVD is dominated by the guest artist, Brian Stokes Mitchell. Although he has a beautiful voice, he sang very few Christmas songs and too many other songs. I purchashed this DVD to hear my favorite Choir singing my favorite Christmas music, not to hear Mr. Mitchell. If I wanted to hear him, I would have purchased a DVD by him."
2,Not the best recording,"Not a bad show, just a very poor recording. Who ever mixed this show really screwed it up. The guitar and bass could not be heard at all, where even a simple tapping on the ring of the snare drum would completely distract you from Dwight's singing. Picture quality is fine, I think only the most hard-core of Dwight's fans will truly enjoy this one."
3,An enjoyable read about the Ultra secret.,"I am not sure how much the author was involved in the Ultra discovery, but he did devise a way to communicate the information received in Ultra to the various personnel involved in the war effort. Thus the Germans did not find out they had been had. He also interacted with Winston Churchill and communicated his findings.FW was a cavalry officer, fighter pilot, POW, farmer, spy, and airline official. He was also modest and worked within the system.This is a nice personal book about a man's contributions to winning the war. FW certainly made his contribution. This was a enjoyable read about a spy's contributions in breaking the Ultra secret."
1,Tired and outdated,"It may have been useful once, but this book -- dated 1996 and 1997 -- is terribly out of date. The world of job-hunting has passed this author by. There's lots of generic info about starting a home-based business, but you'll get killed in the real world if you try to pass yourself off as a job-search expert based upon what's in this tired old tome. Can't imagine why it's still in print."
2,A Weak Effort From This Author,"This book started out with promise; however, it has a lot of problems, which previous reviewers have already pointed out. I would like to add that the editing was very shoddy as well. At one point the word ""grizzly"" is used to describe something gruesome, when the word should have been ""grisly"". This kind of mistake pulls me out of the story, and makes me lose respect for both the editor and the author."
2,ok a bit boring,"Well I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, this book wasn't as good as the previouse books I've read by this author. I also found that the heroine was a bit too much. I didn't really warm to her at all. I liked the hero although he was just a bit too much of a hero. I couldn't see real people in them at all.It took me a while, several days to get through this book. I kept putting it down and read several books in between. This book does have a sequel which is Pip's story I am hopeing that her story will be an easier read."
1,tiresome,"A book about the magic angels can bring is fine, but this one kept repeating the same concepts about God, His angels and fate. The hero was sooo good that he couldn't possibly be real. On the other hand, the heroine was always in a bad mood. I can't understand how Will could stand her. All in all, it was very tiresome."
3,Pay it Forward- sucks you in!,"It was a bit too in your face with the message and the schmaltz but I was taken in with story and liked Kevin Spacey and Haley. I would watch it again, but I'd feel guilty about it!"
4,great movie,very emotional and inspirational movie. this movie could set examples for everybody. watch it. its great
5,Pay It Forward,Thisis one of the most heart felt movies I've ever seen. What the boy was trying to to change the world. It's just to bad he looses his life trying to help someone
2,Nothing special,"I guess the story was decent, but it was still kinda boring. The only part of the movie I thought was that great was when the black guy (don't know his name) started yelling at the nurse to help the guy's daughter. It was pretty much the only funny part in the whole movie. The actors were pretty good (even Bon Jovi) but not enough to save a boring plotline. I thought Trevor's death was just unnecessary, and like some other guy here said, it blew the whole theme of helping people. The kid tries to help some other kid, and he gets his guts cut up. Really makes me feel like going out and changing the world."
5,An Astoundingly good film,"I loved it, maybe a little chick flickish, but hey, I'm a chick. Haley Joel Osment did a fantastic job, his best yet. It was very touching, a real tear-jerker. I give this film 2 very enthusiastic thumbs-up."
3,So-so movie,"If you're in the mood for a whiny, the world is (...) but let's be optimistic (is that oxymoronic or what?) movie...then this flick is for YOU! Maybe I'm insensitive...or maybe I was just in the wrong mood...but movies like this should make me feel good about human nature in the end. This depressed me. Good acting...but bad directing left this one begging to be ejected from my DVD player..."
1,Can you award 'Negative' stars,"Horrendous! For anyone who truly loved the book (and I really did), this was the most terrible sort of betrayal. Helen Hunt - let's face it, she's a TV actress. Her Oscar role just happened to fit what she does...every time. Next to Kevin Spacey (also woefully miscast) she's very thin broth. And, I've come to believe that Haley Joel Osment is, like Hunt, a one-trick pony. Admittedly, the book jumps back and forth in time, and would have presented a difficult adaptation [although, I wonder if Quentin Tarrantino could have handled it?]; but, the story was so twisted out of shape that you tend to lose the meaning.One of my Worst Movies of All Time."
2,Pay me back.,"Manipulative, New Agey movie. A junior-high kid (Haley Joel Osment) has a homework assignment for social studies class: think of something to change the world, and try to put it into action. That's a snap! Osment does three very big favors to three different people . . . with the caveat that each of them must ""pay it forward""; i.e., do three very big favors to three different people. And so on, and so on. . . . Not to my taste. Nor should it be to yours, if you have any taste yourself. The movie's ending, while attempting to jerk tears, merely raises incredulousness."
1,you deserve better than this,"a great idea, followed up by terrific performances is destroyed by the filmmakers. I personally like to blame the director, Mimi Leder. The ending totally panders to the audience, willing you to cry, to feel sorry for the characters. It lacks all thought and willingness to take hold of a world changing idea-- the centerpiece of this movie-- to try and show that world can be a better place than it is.To top it off, the final shot is STOLEN from ""Field of Dreams,"" a film with beauty, honesty and hope-- a long line of headlights, plus people holding candles (CANDLES, oh how hopeful!) as a tribute to what they hoped this movie could be, but utterly failed to be.Avoid it at all costs. ""Pay it Forward"" is a hoax."
2,The good and the bad,"This is such a wonderful story and could even be a true to life story. But I was SO DISAPPOINTED that it will not be one that I can retain for my personal collection, nor let my friends and family experience, because of the extremely foul language and the explicit sexual scene. I thought of how easily this film could have been ""cleaned up"" and the message and story line would not have been diminished in the least. If you have children watching I most assuredly would not recommend it, but as an adult the noted contents of the movie ruins it for me as well."
2,Huh?,"Ok, so why in the Hell would this movie have to end like that? It's such a ripoff. It doesn't even provide the emotional impact the director intended, it just leaves a person thinking, ""What was the point of that?"" It has NO RELEVANCE to the message of this movie at all. I know this movie was supposed to be sappy and heartfelt and one of those flood-the-theater-with-tears movies. But the ending absolutely kills (no pun intended) the message of the movie, because it makes the viewer forget everything that's happened in the past two hours. It instead makes them think about the ending, and how crappy it is, and how bad the movie is because of it."
3,A Pleasant Surprise: Great Acting All Around,"With a cast that includes Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey and doe-eyed Hayley Joel Osmet, this film really deserves a peak. Theatrically, it didn't do that well because of its downbeat ending. Regardless, this film has lots to offer. In particular, its plot about people (in this case, Haley Joel Osmet) doing things for people less fortunate than he is. Without giving too much away, this film says a lot about hope, kindless, survival, love of family and overcoming one's afflictions. Rent it. It deserves to see seen. The performances - Osmet, Spacey, Hunt - are terrific."
4,Let's try this...,"The filn, while a bit trite, has an excellent premisis that ALL of us should try. Many of us today have very selfesh and greedy personalities. The main character in this film shows a differeng ""way."""
1,Terrible,"This movie was ok, not great, but ok (maybe 3 stars), until the end. The end was terrible. First what happens to the main character. Then the whole stupid part with the candles--is she supposed to feel all better now because people are standing outside her house with candles? I don't think so. I know people in the theatre with me thought it was really poignant, but I thought they just tacked on a depressing ending to make it seem more weighty.If you don't like sappy, maudlin movies, definitely pass on this one."
2,Not Again!,"Cowardly exit. They must start from the end with these films, and work their way back. Where are the writers? Anyone got an idea for a new ending? One more of these and I may stopping watching movies.===Five months later: I HAVE stopped watching movies."
2,Could have been a great film,"Normally I would give this film 4 stars for having a great theme told through a well crafted story with solid acting. It loses a star for being racist, and another for an unnecessary plot development that spoils an otherwise enjoyable experience."
2,Concerned with Language,"I had seen this movie several years ago, and I can tell you, the meaning of the movie is outstanding! However, this particular version must be a remake, and they have added ""adult language"" and in my opinion, it ruins the whole movie. I recommend selling the ""filtered"" version so that kids can watch it. I wanted my children to learn from the values of the movie, yet had to cut it off when the vulger language started rolling.I would buy the ""filtered"" version that came out several years back, but do not recommend purchasing this one."
4,NEVER QUITE REACHES GREAT BUT A GOOD MESSAGE IS PASSED ON!,"This is a strange film to me because there are three very good performances by Spacey,Hunt and Osment but, I never felt completely engrossed in the story. It has several good scenes and it carries a nice message but, it seemed to meander at times. It's not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. I rate it 3 1/2 stars for the effort by the lead characters and the message. The DVD transfer is very good."
3,Good performances in a lousy screenplay.,"There were some excellent performances by Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osment and some very good scenes. Unfortunately the screenplay took too many wrong turns and the ending did not work at all. I think a good movie earns its ending, and this one did not do that. There were enough good individual scenes (especially between Hunt and Spacey) to make it worth 2.5 stars, but I don't have that option, so I rounded it up. I'm just a generous guy."
5,a must see - over and over and over,"This movie ranks with ""It's a Wonderful Life"", in that it should be seen by everyone, many many times. In previous reviews, most bemoan the ending, but this movie could end in no other way. Who, in the history of mankind, has not paid the ultimate price when instituting an idea guaranteed to improve mankind. Humans have also proven over and over that they can take a wonderful idea and corrupt it, either through greed or lust for power and fame. This simple movie takes a simple idea and shows us all that we are indeed able to make the world a better place."
2,THERE SHOULD BE A SEPERATE RATING SYSTEM,"On the jacket of the movie it sound like a great feel-good flick. But there should also be ratings included for endings such as SE --sad ending. I HATE sad endings. Forget the message, I want to walk out in a good mood! No doubt the acting was great and the story was even great, but ruined for my best friend and I by the ending."
2,Gratuitous Chick Flick,"I don't usually like Chick Flicks, but Pay It Forward was a compelling story and kept me watching to the near end. Then, for no good reason, the ending breaks what could have been a really good story into nothing more than a gratuitous event with no apparent objective other than to make every woman in the audience break into tears. It added nothing to the story and soured me completely on the film. A nice film (and this from an Action Film kinda guy) goes to waste for the last few minutes. A waste of time, except that Hellen Hunt is in it. ;-)"
1,Would not play,"Piece of garbage. Would not play in my disc player, threw it in the trash PIEC OF JUNK! SUPER ANNOYED to have to type so many words before you take my rating!!!"
5,Profoundly Inspiring!,"The most inspiring and uplifting movie I've ever seen! More than mere entertainment, it's message is life-altering. One person CAN make a difference in the world. Why shouldn't it be you?"
4,Unforgettable!,"""Paying it forward,"" is in essence the concept that when something good happens in your life you don't pay back the person who helped you, but rather find someone else who needs help in some way- something which they cannot do for themselves but that you can do for them- and you do it, asking them to continue in turn by helping someone else in a way only they can. This idea is amazing considering we all have different gifts and talents and contacts! Just think what kind of world it would be if everyone embraced this idea! The film is somewhat sad- but a short, well-lived life is something to be celebrated and, in my opinion, much more glorious than a long life lived for oneself (which reminds me of a quote fromBraveheart, ""Every man dies, but not every man truly lives."") I believe the message of this film should be taken to heart by all of us, especially in this day and age when even a little hope could change destinies- and thus the world."
1,3rd-rate imitation of a good movie --- don't be fooled!,"A lot of people found this to be a very inspiring & emotionally moving film. Surprise surprise, that is exactly what the studio's marketing plan was hoping you would think. Their marketing strategy seems to have paid off quite nicely.Do not mistake cloying, manipulative drivel for compelling story-telling. Do not mistake maudlin sentimentality for emotional depth. Do not mistake the emotional sucker-punch (to borrow from another reviewer) of an ending for irony. Remember these things and you will find this to be one of the more contrived, manipulative pieces of tripe to blight the big screen in a number of years. It's not the worst, because one can always point to ""Patch Adams,"" but it is still pretty damned irritating."
1,I can't give it 0 stars,"I can't really say it better than the previous review who called it manipulative and sanctimonious, but I want to reinforce that characterization. This is tripe of the rankest order. I watched the movie because I had read an excerpt of the book, and it seemed sincere and goofy, and I was in the mood for some sincere goofiness one day. But this movie is bloodlessly cynical and manipulative. Why Hunt and Spacey did it is beyond me, but Henry Fonda made ""The Mad Miss Manton"", so..."
2,Pay it Back,"Terrible Movie! Helen Hunt looks like a witch. Its awful, and sappy, and boring. Goes off in too many directions. Stupid ending. I liked the filming in Las Vegas-I've been thinking about moving there. That's all I got out of it."
5,Awesome,"Movies just plain don't get any better than this one. This has you looking at your own life and values long after you have seen the movie. When the characters cry you will surely find tears in your own eyes. Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osment and Kevin Spacey all deserve oscars for their performances in this movie. They pull at your very heart strings with every scene. Have you ever been the recipient of a Pay It Forward? I have and trust me the feeling is beyond words, yet this movie describes it right down to the final tear. Pay It Forward and make someone's world brighter."
2,A Sweet film with a bad ending,"I loved Pay it Forward through out. The performances by Haley Joel Osment and Helen Hunt as son and mother are strong. Kevin Spacey is great as well a scarred teacher who Osment fixs up with his mom.Pay it Forward has a nice peace on earth storyline through out and is just a nice movie, until....it hits the end where it throws a very unneeded sob ending at you. The end is still sort of sweet in a way I guess but it just doesn't belong. If it wasn't for that I would of easly called it one of the best films of 2001."
2,"Solid acting, disjointed storyline, horrible ending","The performances by Osment and Hunt are worthy of praise. Spacey is simply not given the opportunity to do much in this movie (not much range or depth to his character). The story kind of hops around, but does do a good job of getting the audience emotionally involved with the characters. This movie may have earned 3 to 3 1/2 stars if it were not for the absolutely pointless ending. I won't give anything away, but you are made to pay dearly for your emotional involvement."
3,Kinda Drags,"I felt that had a few scenes been cut to get a shorter running time this film would have been better, but it seems to drag along and by the time you get to the end you're really depressed, (but maybe that's how the film is intended to be)."
4,good,"this is a wouderful movie, it taught me that be thank-ful for what you have even if it's not good, and forgive the people cause everyone makes mistakes thats why they invented earaser's, this movie has taught me alot, that you won't know what you had( talkin about the kid) until you lost it) this movie is a sad one.. im in 8th grade 15 yrs old and i had to watch it and i cried.. it was sad and for anyone who has a problem like that you need to get help and not wait until you lost something you truley do love.. well im not gonna sit here all day cause i know me i would give the movie away..thanks"
3,"okay film,horrible ending",This movie is not as bad as people say it is in fact its kind of good but would of been better if not for a bad ending.This is how it ends these kids are beating up another kid and then trevor played by haley joel osment tries to help and gets stabbed in the liver and dies.So take a look at this one and just rent it.
1,If you could get past the swearing the concept is wonderful.,If you could get past the swearing and the constant taking the Lord's name in vain the concept of Paying It Forward is wonderful. We do practice that in our home and Family. Every American citizen Paying It Forward would change the face/course of this Great Nation of ours. This is NOT a Family friendly movie at all because of the language and two bad scenes ... one in the beginning with dancers on poles in a bar setting and a bedroom scene. Shame on Amazon for billing this as a Family movie.
1,STUUUUUPID MOVIE!,"This movie would get 0 stars if I could help it. First off it starts out really slow. I actually fell asleep halfway through. Now how in the world is a little kid going to start the next big CRAZE. ""Pay it Forward"" Very silly idea! When everyone was crying at the end of the movie! I was laughing cause it was SO DUMB! This movie made me want to run out, take in a bum and save the world. Pay this Movie No mind!"
1,Why not give the teacher's role to a black actor?,"This movie missed the opportunity to explore the important issue of racism and race relations by making the scarred Vietnam Vet teacher a white man. The character in the book is a black man, and a wonderful character. By using Kevin Spacey, the director missed an entire dimension of the teacher's interaction with the child and his mother. Socioeconomic differences were also important, but race was as well."
1,"Good Message, Bad Language","I had heard that this was a good movie, but was very disappointed by the foul language spattered all through it. There was a very good message hidden under all the vulgarity, though, I hope someone re-makes this movie in a g-rated format so that others can learn the message of sacrificially helping others in their time of need."
1,Happiest Movie Ever.....NOT!!!,"How much happier can this movie get? Was there a split second in this movie where no one was emotionally or physically hurt? If there was, I'm sorry, but I missed it.Between the father of the teacher setting fire to him, Trevor, the main character getting stabbed to his death, and the mother being a stripper, I failed to see any level of depth throughout the movie. If you cry easily, beware of this movie, you'll fall into a coma triggered by an emotional breakdown. I'm not kidding.The cover lies, I tell you. You see the smiles? I wouldn't be smiling if my mom was a stripper, or my son just got stabbed to death, or my father poured kerosine on me and set me on fire. Tell me if I'm wrong. Please."
2,More like a five-tissue jerker,"The PAY IT FORWARD review rated ""most helpful"" calls this movie a ""five hanky tearjerker"" but most who cried probably did because they'd paid good money to see this corny crap. However, I did need five tissues watching Helen Hunt zipping around in skimpy bikini top after skimpy bikini top and hot bra after hot bra - who knew she had such a smokin' body?!I rate PAY IT FORWARD (a typo, probably, as they must have meant GAY IT FORWARD) two stars for Helen Hunts's tight torso and ample bosoms. That must be the reason Kevin Spacey signed on to do such a trite LIFETIME-level flick, as he gets to make out with her. (So much for the rumors about him.)"
2,strarring 3 of my least favorite actors in a nothing-new-here flop,"Well, my title says it all. There is nothing special or amazing about this movie. I don't like the three main actors, and the ending was just laughable. Sorry, but it was a stupid movie."
1,Pay IT Forward?.Yes.Just don't FAST FORWARD. Ending BLOWS!,"Yaaargggh! ... Sure the film's contrived and suspenseless.Sure we know we're getting manipulated.We all know what the premise is going in. We just want to see if the studio can execute the thing with some style and wit . And they almost make it, kinda. But the ending blows. And while I'm at it, can I say that if I see just ONE MORE shot of a moistened Haley Jo Osmond and his tearful eyes I'm going to york! Ok so the ending and that little stinker both bring the movie down. It could been a contenduh! If it weren't for the decent, warming premise and the apprearence of Jon"" On A Steel Horse I Ride"" Bon Jovi I would have torn this tape from my player and hurled it at the cats that hang out behind my apartment's dumpster. Not to hurt the cats, but maybe they could put it to better use, such as KITTY LITTER!"
2,I See Dead People....,"....what the..? Did I see the same movie everyone else did? The pay if forward scheme was about the only thing that made this a lil more than a made for tv movie. All the majors--Spacey, Hunt, Ozment--was sleepwalking thru thier respective roles. Angie Dickerson in homeless drag showed some acting chops that most of us were not aware of, but how many times have we seen the single mother and kid scenario with said kid trying to hook moms up with""this guy I'd think will make a great dad""? C'mon. For your entertainment buck, Hollywood can do better. Interesting for a few moments but then it dries up into predictability."
1,Return it Back!!!!,Feel good movie? Touching? Heart warming? C'mon people. Get a clue. The characters in this movie are boring and have no emotional content. The story line is predictable and the whole 'pay it foward' concept in unbelievable.
3,Parents Beware,"I was very excited about watching this movie with my daughter. I thought it would be a great lesson for her. Unfortunately, despite its PG rating, this movie was loaded with bad language along with a few rather suggestive scenes (strip club, a couple beginning to undress-which I skipped through so I don't even know how far it went). I was shocked that it was able to earn a PG rating with all that! Honestly, the language was even too much for me. It seemed unnecessary to the plot in most cases.The movie has a strong message of how one small act can cause ripples beyond your community. Its too bad they ruined it with excessive bad language."
3,Too much profanity.,"It had an excellent theme, and the movie would have been just as good without those words.If they eliminated strong language, I doubt anyone, after the movie, would say, ""That was a great movie, but too bad there wasn't more profanity."""
5,Pay It Forward Rules!!!!!!!!,Pay it forward is a great movie.I think that Trevor had a really good idea to change the world that might actually work in real life!!!!!!BUT............I dont like the end...overall i give it 5.'cause it rules!
4,Pay it foward,This a great movie.it keeps your insterest from the start to the end.It has a meaning that you don't understand until near the end.But it makes you to want to watch it over again.
5,Heartwarming,"I have watched this several times, and will never get tired of it. Great movie to watch when you are feeling down on yourself or others, as it really makes you see what is truly important in life."
5,Amazing Movie!,This world would be a much nicer place to live if people paid it forward more! This is a much watch!
3,"Good movie, BUT...","Didn't like the ending, not saying more, but why is violence necessary?Typical of today's society, in a movie about a noble idea, there has to be glorified adultry. Maybe, just maybe, if we didn't push this idea that to have a relationship, sex is mandatory, then just maybe, we could convince some people to wait until marriage."
4,Moving story,This movie pulls at your heart strings but still is a feel good movie. Makes you believe that there are good people still out there.
2,Arrrggghh!,"With its warm, original premise and Oscar-pedigree cast, this could have been a decent ""family values"" kind of movie if it wasn't sabotaged in its dying moments by an utterly pointless surprise climax and a hideously mawkish ending. It skirts self-indulgence for 100 minutes then drives full speed over the brink. But without the emotional setup this kind of ending requires, rather than weeping you'll probably be rolling your eyes. The film runs slightly long, but thankfully the performances from Spacey, Hunt and ""that kid"" (Haley Joel Osment) are magnificent throughout, so at least there's something interesting to look at - other than your watch. On paper, this must have looked like gold: a best-selling novel, an Academy-blessed cast, and even the music from ""American Beauty"". Proof yet again that films designed to garner Oscars rarely do."
1,stupid,"Sorry, I can only muster one word for my overall summation of this movie - STUPID.Beyond that, when the director TRIES to make the audience cry, most of the time the movie ends up being over the top and campy- I guess those two apply to this movie as well. Okay, it was stupid, campy, and over the top.Rent ""Old Yeller"" if you want to cry..."
2,Ironical,"How ironical it is that, whenever non-Christians stumble onto the teachings of Jesus Christ, so long as the name of Jesus Christ is removed from it, they suddenly trip over themselves in heaping accolades on this ""new"" philosophy. How very strange.This movie in itself deserves no such praise as it was given at the time of it's release.It was not well crafted. And the ending was woeful."
1,wrong format for Europe,"I'm sorry, I can hardly use the copys I got because it is NTC. I thought the Amazon-staff would know that Iceland is in Europe and we use Pal-format on our DVDs."
1,Misleading,"Don't let the picture on the box fool you. This is not a feel good movie. The movie is built on a premise of paying it forward that has the potential to be a great movie, but the ending will attempt to break your heart and only outrage you because the writer(s) chose to use an ending to evoke emotion in a cheap, insulting and underhanded way. Without giving away the ending for those who still want to see it, be prepared to be disappointed. The descriptions of the movie, the cover of the DVD and the promos all lead you to believe that this is a feel good movie, it definitely is not. The idea this movie was based on, paying it forward, has great potential but the direction the end of this movie takes negates the core of what paying it forward has to offer. Why would anyone pay it forward if this was the outcome???"
1,Put It Back!,"An interesting premise goes south quickly in this stinker. I like Spacey and Osment, but I feel that Helen Hunt is way overrated. Every cliche in the book is trotted out here and the predictable heartstring-tugging is unbearable. I didn't cry, sniffle, or feel otherwise emotionally moved by this film, other than to switch it off at the end feeling cheated. Do yourself a favor and watch ""Life is Beautiful"" instead."
4,"Great movie, cheap prices and fast shipping.","Shipped on time, Amazon is so good at keeping you informed and on top of order tracking, etc. and I love the movie, it's really great for anyone of any age - a rarity these days."
2,Manipulative ending,"I really liked this movie until the last couple of minutes. The ending was contrived, unnecessary, and left me cold. WHY, WHY, WHY do some moviemakers insist on ruining a perfectly good movie with arbitrary and manipulative melodrama?? I do not mind tragic or sad endings if they are poignant. In this case, it actually worked against the message of the movie. Boo hiss! Thumbs down to the screenwriter for a very poor and tasteless choice at the end!!"
5,Pay It Forward,"This is a fantastic movie, the performances of the 3 lead actors are incredible. It will make you happy and also make you cry. We need more movies like this one. I will have to buy it so I can watch it again."
5,Amazing movie,"""Pay It Forward"" was an amazing movie. The idea that Trevor could change the world one act at a time was really cool. This movie is really sad at the end though. I'm still crying. I cry every time I see this movie. Haley(Trevor) also plays Cole Sear in ""The sixth Sense"" and I have to say, his manager has given him some really hard roles to play. In ""The Sixth Sense"" Haley is only nine years old. He has to play an incredibly hard role. In ""Pay it Forward"" he is only around twelve years old but again, has to play a really hard role. This movie was a really amazing movie. It is so sad but really amazing the way that the public, after his death, responds. Haley, can take any role he is given and turn it into an extrodonary charter! I would recommend this movie to ANYONE!"
3,Dont read this review if don't like spoilers!,"Over all a decent movie..i could really care about how many issues this movie takes on (something most of the other reviewers can't get past). The reason why i could care less...real life deals with all of these issues and this movie imitates real life. Also, the movie doesn't focus on all of these issues..it just brings them up. O.k. Anyways, good movie, interesting, not a waste of time, but the ending...ugggg. The little kid dies for gods sake! What is up with that? I absolutly hate it when the characters die out of the blue like that. It totally goes against the whole story..here is this little kid trying to do all these good things for people..and what does he get..he gets killed...o.k. so this movie imitates real life and good kids get killed in real life.. but i like most people..would not have watched this movie if i had known the manner and how quickly the kid dies. Urrrr..it makes me mad. Actors are good..and jon bon jovi shows up..decent actor."
3,Let down by the ending.,Until the ending I had been thinking that this was a movie I could watch over and again. However .. the final scenes are a disaster and only served to steal back all my enjoyment from the earlier story. There is no point to this ending. A bit more thought and feeling for the audience would not have gone amiss. The overall idea is a good one. I would not have been surprised if the movie had inspired people to actually go out and do some good .. if the ending had not destroyed the feel good factor.The saving grace is the wonderful performance by Haley Joel Osment. He is a genuine star who deserves Oscar recognition. In this movie he is at his best.Worth watching for this young actor alone. But be prepared for the final let down.
4,A touching story that should be followed!,"This story line is so simple and basic, but we as a busy society forget these basic concepts. It was nice to be reminded and to see a touching story line. The end will surprise you... I did not give it a 5 star because the acting was poor, but good enough to get the point across. This is a great movie to buy and watch it over and over when we feel life is getting to tough. A basic concept... but ""Pay it forward""! Enjoy"
2,What A Crying Shame!,"This should have been a great movie to watch with your kids. However the ending of the movie ruined it. Any inspirational thoughts or feelings you may have had were replaced by an incredible sadness. Not only that one of the first thoughts I had was, is this alcoholic Mother going to start drinking again? If you want a happy ending to this movie don't watch the last 10 minutes. Then you will feel like going out and making a difference in the world and share a beautiful message with your children."
5,Would use again,The movie arrived just in time for my boyfriend's birthday! It was in mint condition and still wrapped in plastic when we got it. Thanks so much!
4,Very good fundamentals,This is a very good book that clearly shows the fundementals of wrestling. The basic wrestling skills and drills in the book are all very useful for beginning to intermediate wrestlers.
1,Difficult to follow,"I found this book to be very difficult to follow. I realize that software engineering is not necessarily a thrilling topic, but I found this book to be far slower reading than most textbooks. I had trouble following the author at points, and I especially disliked the questions at the end of the chapters. They often used different terms than those discussed in the chapters, which made answering them difficult. Also, many questions asked you to put together an example of some technique discussed in the book, but the example in the book was vague and didn't give enough information for you to be able to complete the exercise. I really haven't gotten anything out of this textbook at all."
2,Should be better,"It is quite complete. The main issues are all there. And it isn't too difficult to follow. But the structure does wobble a bit. It also fails to galvanize the reader. It is a bit of a sleeper since it just presents one technique after the other. No sparkle, inflection nor much motivation. Right now I'm halfway through (chapter 6) and I will finish it, cause the subject matter is all there. But I wish I had another book to choose from."
3,Average,"This book contains basic information and does not really elaborate beyond that premise. It's not bad but if you are looking for more detail and a little more substance, look for a different book. However, I really did not mind it for a start."
2,this book will make you want to read it again and again,"when you're exposed to faulty education check out this book! this book will teach you from top to bottom what needs to be done...in theory. Moreover, it has sample cases and lots of procedures written by the authors themselves. For those majoring in Software engineering this is a must have!"
2,Mickey Mouse,"A simplified version of ""In Search of a Better World"". Totally watered down, comic book level presentation of Popper. Not worth the money."
1,Not even 1 star,"Not even adequate. This book is so poorly written as to be incomprehensible. Where was the editor? Where was the copyeditor? Fascinating subject, but don't bother with this one."
3,"Not bad, but some errors","This book is a useful history of Alexandria, but I had some serious reservations after reading the author's chapter on the career of Alexander, which is completely out of sequence. Vrettos places the battle of Granicus after the liberation of Egypt and notes, erroneously, that Issus (which he seems to think is separate from Cilicia, but which is in fact another name for the same place) and Tyre occur after Alexander's trip down the Indus. Too much reliance on primary sources and too little attention to modern scholarship will lead to boners like this: ""...he finally marched to attack Darius, who was advancing toward him with an army a million strong."""
1,"History, Not!","Mr. Vrettos treads lightly over 1000 years of history in a 200-page book filled with anecdotes, legends, and some well-worn and generalised facts which do not make for real, serious, history. Furthermore, as evidenced from his writing as well as the bibliography he credits at the end, there is a total lack of modern research. Reading this book would be a waste of time!"
3,provisional rating because of channel recording limit,"Warning: this dvd recorder will not record TV channels above 125. Which is probably a legal copyright thing. But say, for instance, you have a son away at college, and that son is hooked on HBO Rome but he can't get HBO in his dorm room, so being a good dad you say you'll record it and send it up. Can't do it using this machine."
1,my review,This product is a laff and a farce....... I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy!!!
1,Doesn't appeart to support multi-region hacks,"I neglected to check to see if this player supported hacks to allow PAL and other region settings before buying it.If anybody knows of one, please reply and I'll gladly change my rating."
1,Disapointed,"This started out as one of the best electronic components I have ever purchased. Was very pleased with the ease of operation and many different ways to burn dvd's. Unfortunately after about 200 dvd's the unit ceased to operate. Fortunately I had saved all the paperwork on the item. When looking over purchase date I noticed the warranty had expired in the previous month.Beware of a unit with many features like this one. I ended settling on a Toshiba of lesser price, purchased the extended warranty to insure at least a couple of years of use. Happy to say after 300 dvd's Toshiba unit is still plugging along even though it doesn't have as many features and the ease of operation."
2,"When it works, it's great.","Had this unit for about 8 months now and have taken it twice for warranty repair. When it works, I love it--especially the FR function. It always records wondefully--but it can ruin a disk when finalizing.After owning it for 3 months, it started to make a grinding sound when finalizing. Then the finalizing process failed--the device reported the disk was unreadable. It can't be the DVDs--I use several major manufacturers. The burner fails on all types and will fail in the middle of a batch. The repair place fixed it the first time. Now, three months later, it did it again--ruining about 50% of the DVDs. I took it back and the repair place said they couldn't duplicate the problem. Brought it home, it's failing, and I'm very frustrated by the unreliability of the device. Time to contact Panasonic, I suppose."
4,Another winner,"Having recently purchased a HD TV, I needed a recorder with upconvert capability. The Panasonic meets that requirement just fine. My standard DVDs appear almost HD in quality. The SD slot is clever. Insert the card and the photos display, and they look terrific on the HD display. Having already owned a Panasonic recorder, I was already familiar with the recording quality and functionality of the programing, which is quite intuitive. The only disappointment came in the way the machine handles DVD-RW discs. It seems to treat them as ROMs, requiring finalization. Great machine, otherwise. Recommended!"
1,This item is overpriced at Amazon,"If you go to the Panasonic website, you will see this listed at $199! Don't even think about paying the $300. ""discounted"" price here without checking other places..."
5,Panasonic DMR-ES25S DVD recorder,This is a high quality product at a reasonable price. I enjoy it very much.
1,Disappointed,"I should have read the description more carefully. I thought these were a smaller version of the foam dice set. These only go to 1000 whereas the foam dice go to 1 million. They are much better for teaching place value. Also, the picture on this set gives you the impression it's a game. It's not, just dice. The cost to returned them is more than what I paid, so all I can do is warn a potential buyer and be wary of Amazon's descriptions. I'm surprised Amazon didn't offer me some kind of discount on a future purchase. I think that would have be a nice gesture on their part."
4,The Deer Strikes back!,"This is definitely a fun game. It would have earned a full 5 stars but the dialog does get tedious at times. It's goofy and lighthearted fun. There is a red SUV you can enter and drive around after all the hunters are killed. I found it in West Virginia at different locations. In the beginning, watch for the hippy dude, don't shoot him, he is your friend. He also points and gives you verbal hints in addition to the ""gas"" supplies. Not a game for little kids."
5,Need more like this,"I first played this game at a friends house back in 2002. I had figured by the time I bought it (in 2008) DA 6 or 8 or something like that would be out by now, but it stopped with DA 4 unfortunately.The game is fun and a great change, as other reviewers have said, from the norm. I don't play a lot of video games. I probably would if more were like this. Fun, not too serious, and relatively easy to play. The commentary by the deer, Bambo, is great although it would be nicer to have some more because I think I've heard evertyhing in the two years I've been playing it about 20 times. A newer version would, in my opinion, have an endless supply of one-liners and smart alecky comments.I give it five stars because it IS fun to play, it IS funny, and it IS unlike anything else I've played. I don't know that I'd pay $75 for a copy of the game but since it is the last one made and if you are a true collector of games you'll enjoy playing over and over, go for it."
5,Great Game,"I was a fan of DA 2 and DA 3, and owned DA 1. I found it to be a fun way to kill an afternoon. The SUV shows up in the last level after you have killed all 12 baddies at least once.I was hoping for DA 5, but it does not appear to be a go. This was the best in the series. I am not normally a fan of the hunting games, but this one caught my interest. Hunting the hunters is great.I haven't been able to get it to work on Windows 7, but it does work on Vista and XP. I did have some problems with a few Vista machines, but it worked on most of the ones I tried. For those with the Professsional 7 or higher versions of Windows, try it using the Virtual Windows XP option; the minimal graphics requirements may work in that mode."
2,"The pictures are good, I guess","If you want to see pictures of the early milk mustaches, this book is for you. If you want to learn anything of substance about the campaign, this book is NOT for you. The written introduction and copy throughout the book have a very ""dumbed down"" tone and are sickeningly self-promoting. Look elsewhere for real information about the campaign."
4,It was spectaculrifish! But many ads were missing!,"I collect milk mustache ads, and was so happy when they came out with the book! Its a cool book, but many ads were missing. At least 3 common ads were missing, and a bunch of contest winners, and even some popular spoofs. If the sequel includes these others, it will be complete! Otherwise, buy it today! VISIT MY MILK MUSTACHE SITE!! http://www.fly.to/milkadheaven/"
5,The Milk Mustache Book : A Behind-The-Scenes Look at America,This is a wonderfull book of stupendous photos with famous and not so famous people that were used for the milk mustache campaign. The photo with steve young is totally cool and the one with Isabella Rosesellini is also very nice to look at. This was a great avertising campaign and the photos are just astounding. This is a keeper.
2,Pick a Subject!,"I guess I don't think of photo editing as digital photography. When I think digital photography, I'm thinking of the art of photography, taken with a digital camera instead of a film camera. That's all.Photo editing, to me, is different. If you are looking for a book explaining aperture, exposure, shutter speed, f/stops, etc., this book only has 41 pages on those subjects.There are 354 pages total (not counting the glossary) and 194 of them are on the photo editing Elements program.I found myself skipping and skimming and flipping for more information. As if I had missed something, I would find myself going back and re-reading and still being let down. I wanted a book on taking better pictures, not taking OKAY pictures, and fixing them later with an outside program - and maybe that's my fault with the definition I have in my head. I didn't want a book on Elements, as I don't have that program."
2,Digital Photography for Dummies by King - Review,"Very, very basic. Even the ""technical info"" was very basic and offered little technical insight. All digital editing information is from the single prospective of Photoshop Elements - a great plug for Adobe - though nowhere on the cover is it stated that the book's editing tips are based soley on this single editor. Maybe a third of the book was devoted to editing so a third of the book for those without AP Elements software is of very little value. Not much to learn from the book unless you have never owned a camera or taken a snapshot - in that case this book would likely have some utility to get you started."
1,SCAM,this is an exact copy of the public domain FREE version which does not credit the translator! thank goodness fkr kindle samples. Do not pay for this!!!!
1,Asian import means poor video quality,"One big problem - it's an Asian import, and that means it has the poorest of video quality. If you want to watch a good movie with absolutely awful video quality, then this is your choice. What a shame. Cecil must be spinning in his grave."
5,An excellent epic,"The version of the DVD of Samson and Delilah (1949) that I purchased is from Zhi Sen Studio Inc., Taiwan, and it is excellent. The box states that it was digitally remastered, and the picture and audio quality are great. One reviewer of this movie wrote that he was disapponted that it wasn't in widescreen--this movie wasn't made in widescreen!! Note to reviewers: Please specify which manufacturer's product you are reviewing, as reviews can show up under several different DVDs of the same movie."
5,Samson and Delilah DVD,"it was a gift, but he loved it, very well packaged and in good shape.Thank you!"
5,Samson and Delilah,Great classic movie. I love these Biblical movies. This movie has a great cast and I thoroughly enjoy watching it everytime. No one does these films better than Cecil B Demille.
5,THE Classic Version,This is THE classic version of the film starring Heddy Lamar & Victor Mature. I received this order quickly from the seller and have NO complaints about the product or seller/shipper.
4,Samson & Delilah Review,"I enjoyed this film. I won't say it's one of the 10 best ever made but the acting is quite good, and the storyline of course is well-known by most people. Llamar looks terrific and Mature makes a great Samson. It's definitely the best version of this tale on film, so if you're a fan of this story, or of Hedy Llamar, this is a good buy."
3,Why Why Why Why,Why would anyone order this book? I read it at the college lib. and it is a master list of Poli Sci dept. heads for the years listed. This is interesting if you REALLY need to know who was the head of the poli sci dept for your college. Do not buy this.
5,Best lovemaking music!,"This is sooo erotic. Make love with this one in the player a few times and every time you hear the first few notes, you'll be in the mood!"
5,Great fusion of sounds,"Lost my copy due to loaning to someone who loved it so much I never got it back. Good stuff, check it out!!!"
2,Not what I expected.,I was looking for a book that was positive about women being single because I enjoy being single and it's so hard to find books or stories about people who are actually happy with the single lifestyle. This book isn't it. For every positive story there are at least 2 negative stories and it's hard to weed through to find the positive ones. I only got a quarter of the way through before I decided I couldn't finish this book. Some of these women sound so pathetic. They don't like being single and they don't like being married so they join together to commiserate their unhappiness. Just too pathetic.
4,Inspirational,"This book is pretty good, it has scriptures for each morning and night. There is a short passage and then versus for if you have time to read further on that day's topic. Overall pretty good. Gives you motivation and something to think about to help you get through the day!"
4,great album,"I like this Album very much, i love to hear the tracks while I'm cycling but I think the older Albums like ""bambule"" especially the track ""fuechse"" are much better!If you want to listen then search on www.amazon.de"
3,Nice hammer. Tips not too strong.,"I'm new to stone carving, so I may be off base here, but using the point to rouph out the shape and whatnot as described in the books I've purchsed required me to file this thing ever 15 to 20 minutes. The tip just won't hold it's shape at a 45 angle to limestone and mushrooms out. Is this normal? Who knows, but I'll be soon purchasing a different brand to find out as the tip on this one will be completely gone before too long."
3,3 1/2 stars,"This is the story of a man who gets hypnotized at a faculty party, and during the hypnosis, reveals the he was Adolph Hitler in a previous life. This is revealed after he was an ostrich. The story progresses when Alan Weston, a television reporter who happened to attend this party, reveals to the public what happened. The public obviously believes this reporter -because he's on TV- and soon all hell breaks loose, from vandalism to murder.The overall story is entertaining. The author has a good, yet over enthusiastic, view of what the publics reaction would be. I see the publics reactions to be not quite as stupid.The pace of the story seemed a little stretched, but with the twists and turns, it was still a good read.Recommended"
4,Interesting Premise Followed Through,"This book hooked me from the very start. What would happen if a happily married father of one was hyponotized and recalled an earlier life as Adolf Hitler? Author Boyll puts together a chilling tale of how the media will take an incident and create news and what this can do to the life of a family. While far fetched in some aspects, you can quite literally picture seeing this on ""Current Affair"" or ""Hard Copy"". The writing is extremely well done and the characters are fully realized. I would recommend this book highly."
2,so implausible I stopped reading halfway through,"reading the reviews here you would think this is one of America's great works of fiction... did people read the same book I did?the ""what if Hitler were reincarnated?"" angle is a great start, but the Nazi Youth/find his bones subplot wasn't compelling and didn't resonate with me at all -- I found myself counting the pages until those sections ended and the rest of the book picked up again.I made it about halfway through before I finally gave up. I could live with the unsympathetic characters and unrealistic situations, but yet another implausible plot twist was the last straw. I skipped to the last chapter just to find out how it ended and I am SO GLAD I didn't waste my time getting there.I think Boyll has potential but tried too hard to make it ""exciting"" and ""gripping"". instead it just got over-the-top and pointless.bottom line: you better REALLY like German history if you want to enjoy this one."
2,Scarcely entertaining...,"Was it a page-turner? Maybe. Did it make me embarrassed to be reading it? Yes.This book features a solid idea, a stupid plot, average writing and B-movie twists that require the kind of faith leaps usually reserved for suicide cults.You may like this book. But you are smarter than this.I will never understand why King recommended this novel."
5,AN UNBELIEVABLY EXCELLENT READ!,"Trying to find a good book for me to read is always a challenge. Walking through the bookstore one day, I noticed the large swastika on the cover of Randall's book. Intrigued, I picked it up and bought it. BEST INVESTMENT EVER! I tell ya, I couldn't put this book down. Once I was finished with it I kept going back to read more of it only to find that I had already finished the whole book. I'm hoping for more books like this from Randall Boyll. I know to look for his name in the bookstores from now on. I was on the edge of my seat during most of this book and enjoyed it immensely. I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for something a little different."
4,A compelling read,"A soild first novel. Unlike the usual genre, an every-day guy and his family become emeshed in a siutation that spins out of control. While I didn't think the writing was all that stunning or superior, the storytelling is. What happens when a typical family become isolated and caught up in agenda's that are not thier own, makes for a compelling read, creating a terrific book. The ending feels a bit abrupt, given the careful weaving of plot strands - but when I closed the book, I wanted someone else to read it so we could talk about it, and I was sorry that the ride was over."
3,Not so thrilled.,"I wasn't too impressed with the manga. I have seen the entire animation series before picking up this book so it seemed like the manga went through each story rather quickly (there are 5 stories in this volume). I hope the later volumes go into a little more depth. I'd recommend this volume to those who have not seen the animation, it's still a good read."
3,"Great artwork, good action, but too many objections","I cannot endorse this manga. To be honest, I feel guilty after buying (and enjoying) the first volume. The art is a cut above the rest and the action sequences are good.However, this is too much of a disturbing fantasy, especially for the target adolescent audience. These ~14 year old young women are conditioned to have unswerving loyalty and love (or close to it) for their adult male handlers.These handlers train, condition, and control the lives of the young women. I have read some reviews of some dating sims and seen a highly disturbing episode of Boogiepop Phantom, and the idea of becoming a girl's mentor is a theme in the genre. Worse yet, the book states that there is an element of heroism in bearing the burden of this unconditional interest. This caters too much to an audience of boys who find it difficult enough to approach females."
3,They really need a photo of the back,"First off, this runs really large. My husband normally wears a large and he was swimming in the size large so you may want to go down a size to avoid an exchange. The back has huge vertical slits running from the top to about halfway down with a coarse mesh underneath. Even standing perfectly still the slits gap open. I understand that this makes it cooler in hot weather, but it also makes it incredibly ugly."
1,Not so good.,"This vest is made a very, very light weight (meaning thin) cotton. It is so thin that one of the snaps on the shoulder came right through the material when placed in the washing machine. I was very disappointed with the lack of ruggedness, cheap material and the look once washed."
3,Dissapointing quality,"I purchased this vest specifically because I wanted the ability to carry my camera and accessories and assorted other travel items for my trip to China.In testing it out before leaving, I discovered that the Velcro closures in the top of the mesh pockets were poorly stitched. I considered returning it, but as we were leaving soon, I elected to keep it rather than do without. It was a wonderful travel item and it allowed me to have access to my camera, lenses, spare batteries and everything else readily without having to carry a bag, which is annoying and makes clearing security checkpoints slow.But the stitching of the Velcro did quickly come completely undone, marring my complete enjoyment of the vest.Considering the price of the vest, and the fact that it was being sold as a functional item and not simply a garment, I would have hoped for better construction."
2,Very poor quality; sending it back,"first day using it , snap ripped thru on back pocket.BAD DESIGN FLAWS1. Shoulder applets are way to small to put my camera strap on and snap ( and I have a narrow 1"" inch strap)2. Snaps on back pocket are to few. It needs one more in the middle at least. Also the snap pulled thru the fabric the very first time I used it3. Back pocket is to small; to narrow and shortI wore very similar design from Banana Republic for over 10 years and loved it. This copy wasn't done well at all."
2,The Worst I've Ever Owned,"Over the years I have probably owned and worn out 4 or 5 Travel Vests of varying manufacture. The one is at the bottom. I bought this after a trip to India wore out my last one. This vest was taken on one long trip to Peru and included a 10 day stint in the Amazon. After that it was only worn occasionally around town and now a short trip to the Delaware Bay. Right now two of the pockets are tearing out at the seams. Several of the small (seemingly useless?) pockets sealed by Velcro cannot even be opened as the Velcro has become so tight that it would take ripping the fabric. One of the front pockets has both a top opening and then a diagonal zipper along the front? I have no idea why.Anyway the bottom line is that this vest is lousy quality and I'm putting it out for the 'Alley People.' I'll buy another Columbia or Travel Smith, both of which have been good products in the past."
4,Incorrect size,"The vest was very nice. I did have to return it as it was just way too large for me. It appeared to be more ofa man's vest and perhaps that was my error. The company responded to my request for a smaller size but they did nothave a small size so I had to return it. I am tall,slender and the medium was too large for me. I am still disappointedthat I can't find one to match this quality."
2,Material substandard for purpose,"Plenty of pockets and zips are good quality, but compared to my other safari vest the material is thin and it will not last more than a year of daily use. Also, the sizing is questionable, I normally take a large, but I reckon a medium would have been a better fit"
4,cool,very well made.....a litttle long.. but a solid vest very tuff...great for the adventurer...washes well and looks even better than it did when new
2,Shrinking Violet(or rather Humvee Vest),"Was really excited when the vest arrived as it had all the pockets and storage spaces I imagined and that I could use in my photographic adventures. However, when I tried it on I couldn't even button the front snap. USELESS. It was manufactured in the far east and the stated 2X would only fit either a slight woman or a small boy.Where's American Made when you need it!"
5,excellant vest,Very nice and lots of pockets the large size is a little larger than large generally. Excellent for covering anything carried on a belt. Light weight and comfortable. Overall great value and stylish good for the outdoors type and could be used for hunting if need be.
4,Excellent time killer,"While probably not the most sought after Transformers material this book is certainly entertaining. I keep it in my purse for when I get bored. Quite honestly I absolutely love this anthology. It has a great balance of moods in the various stories. From deep, to hardcore, to hilarious (a couple have made me laugh out loud) to just down right weird, there's a story to satisfy every aspect of the Transfan in you. :)"
2,Poor Account Of A Fascinating Life,"I agree with one of the other reviewers who found this biographercold and unsympathetic. I'd go further and say this is the worst type of academic writing; a lot of facts and documentation are brought out, but the writer simply isn't talented enough to give it vitality. Instead of attempting some sort of personel interpretation of Zelda's life, Milford gives us overlong plot summaries of Zelda's fiction. No analysis! Just the facts! She treats the deaths of both the Fitzgeralds with the compassion of a coroner. People with Nancy Milford's limited abilities shouldn't be writing biograpies. The reader is given a depressing work on a talented artist, and wounded soul, that passes on no understanding, no sympathy, and no appreciation. How horribly bleak."
3,Not Zelda; Scott,"This book is mistitled. It should be ""Scott and Zelda,"" with Scott's name first, since the novel is weighted toward his life more than hers. It is informative, but could have been 150 pages shorter and still not suffered, if the author would have omitted the large portions she includes from Zelda's novels. I would like to have seen more documentation and interviews from first person witnesses to their lives, many of whom were still available when the book was written."
3,"""God, What A Sob Story !""","""Zelda:A Biography,"" by Nancy Milford, is a depressing story about a woman (with a few bats in her belfry) torn by the never-ending clash of her husband's career and her own talent. A story I could have lived without!"
4,Great to listen to by the pool in the summer,"A very relaxing mix of salsa, merengue and steel drums. And with 20 songs, it lasts a long time."
4,"Beautiful, creative music","I am a great fan of the music of South and Central America, but it is hard to find an album that is not just the run of the mill tourist fare. The title of this album almost turned me off for this reason, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the music of excellent quality. These are all serious musicians with academic and professional background, not just some street band. Huascar Barradas on flute leads most of the songs, and is extremely talented. The overall mood of the album is mellow, with occasional bursts of the driving rhythm typicaly associated with Venezuelan music. The music is relaxing but with enough complexity to keep you interested. I would have liked to have heard more of the harp, cuatro, bandola, however (the flute is great, but it dominates most of the songs). No worries buying this album. You will enjoy it."
3,Wealth of good pictures,This book is good source of recent info and pictures of 26/12/2004 tsunami. The book made me live the events as close as it possible.
1,Dissapointing...,"I gave this book more of a chance than it deserved. I actually finished it. I read 100's of books a year, and this has to be one of the top 10 losers.The story line had potential, but there was little, if any, continuity. There are many questions left unanswered at the end, which is unsurprising as the author tried to sum it all up in 1 page. It actually feels as if the story DIDN'T end.I haven't read anything else by C. N. Bean, and I admit it's possible his other works would be more to my liking - but this story read like a Dick and Jane book. This guy needs to read Stephen King's ""On Writing"" for a few tips. I doubt his other books read any better.Do yourself a favor and try J. D. Robb's ""In Death"" series. You won't be sorry."
5,Outstanding read!,"I really enjoyed reading this book-lots of funny stories to illustrate the life of a substitute teacher...someone we all remember from our youth, but had never thought of in a ""the shoe's on the other foot"" kind of way. A must read for high school teachers and students of all ages. On the serious side, also a great book for full-time teachers to better prepare themselves-and their classroom-for a sub."
3,Not as Good as the Original,This is a continuation of Lederer's original - FRACTURED ENGLISH..The author collects examples on how the English language is misused. They generate laughter and smiles from the reader. . . . Only English teachers and grammarians will appreciate this book.
5,Does the English language drive you crazy sometimes? Read this!,"If you like English & find yourself trying to help someone understand the English language (particularly American English), you will love the humor of ""More Anguished English"".You will find yourself laughing out loud & probably looking on Amazon for more of his hysterical musings about the English language."
2,Did not like.,I like a variety of music and was looking for one of his cds. I did not really like this one becasue it only had two songs I liked. The rest I did not care too much for.I probably should have listened to the entire cd. I would have been able to jusge whether i liked it or not. AT that point I would have know I did not like it.
3,Newspaper style of writing,I found the book writen in a unique style similar to newspaper. Author tried to stick with the facts of the case without elaborating on them. Trying to stay unbiased which is hard to do. One of the subject is a relative and it was not until recent years that i heard the story. There were some details I heard that were not mentioned in the book as well as details i had not heard of.Still an interesting book for everyone. Those looking for a law carreer should read this
1,I had to laugh,"This sounds like the soundtrack you'd play at a Christmas party when playing Musical Chairs ... It is so bad that i had to laugh while i imagined hosting a party to which all of my Brazilian friends were invited and telling them: ""Hey, check my new Christmas Bossa Nova CD"", and then watch as they all left my house because they considered it an insult ... that's how bad this is. Good thing i only listened to the samples in Amazon."
5,good information,good information for starting a design business (not just interior) or to rewrite an existing plan that needs some freshening up.
3,"Received in ""Good"" condition...",The sender was correct that the book was in good (as opposed to excellent) condition. The front and back cover appear to have been chewed on by a family pet & there is a coffee-drip stain at the top of some of the pages. It had no demarkations so I am not distracted by another reader's notes & highlights.
3,hard to follow in class,It's nice not having a huge book to carry around but the digital copy is hard to follow in class due to pages not matching up to paperback version. On some pages the reference tables were cut off even when font size was reduced.
5,Excellent,Excellent. Came on time and in perfect condition. This is a great read for anyone preparing to go into the professional field.
4,Good Source for NCIDQ Review,"I used this book in my professional practice class and a co-worker of mine borrowed it to study for the NCIDQ - she said many of the ethical and business related questions that appeared on the test were covered in this book. It is really well written and easy to follow. The CD has good resources, like mock invoices and POs that you can open and edit."
3,Nice pictures but...,"it IS the full poem and it's probably too wordy for most toddlers. My 21 month old son likes to look at the pictures and flip through the book, but can't wait for me to read each page - there are too many words for his attention span.Not a bad buy if you can do your own shortened version!"
3,No DC current,"Received in new condition, but misleading product description- ""The EX810 measures AC/DC voltage and current, resistance, diode, continuity, frequency, and capacitance.""English is my second language, but doesn't the description mean it also measures DC current? Had to return and get the EX830 that also measure DC current."
2,this book jumps around a lot,I bought this book because I had to do a case analysis in my criminal investigations class.This book was REALLY hard to follow and jumps around a lot.
4,a theory of the Yates murders,"Suzanne O'Malley has a thesis to present: That Andrea Yates, convicted of drowning her five children in their bathtub, was improperly diagnosed. O'Malley sees Yates as a classic victim of bipolar disorder, rather than the ""extreme"" postpartum depression for which she was being treated.This book, exhaustively detailed and written in sometimes casual, conversational language, will keep you turning pages. When you finish you may decide that O'Malley's ideas are correct. The case she makes is not entirely convincing; many aspects of this tragedy remain mysterious. For readers who have been hungry for more details about the Yates family, their marriage, their devotion to a small eccentric cult, Andrea's homeschooling of her children, and other matters, O'Malley's book will feed that curiosity from her own perspective and conclusions."
3,are you there alone,i was very eager to read this book but was disappointed..I wasnt aware that it was going to be so much of the court preceedings and not so much about her background. It really didnt keep me interested.
3,an average in quality true crime book,"The author attempts to explain complex religious and medical issues which she does not completely understand herself. For example, she suggests Catholics and fundamentalist Christians share the same view of salvation. This is not factual. Protestant fundamentalist believe in salvation by grace while Catholics believe works are required for salvation. The author also makes a few mistakes related to psychiatric care referring to a ""one on one"" suicide watch when in fact Andrea was under less scrutiny with fifteen minute checks. The writer could have explored the role malnutrition played and examined the impact on brain chemistry. Andrea was not eating and was breastfeeding, not a healthy combination. However, the book is readable and held my interest."
5,Essential for all Moms,"As a registered nurse and Mom this book is essential. It goes through the stages of feeding starting with breast vs. bottle, including exellent info on breasfeeding. You dont even need to buy a seperate breastfeeding book. Then moves on to babys first foods, including which foods to introduce at certain ages. Gives sample menus for babies of all ages. Also helps parents understand that pushing food on kids only makes them not want to eat. Helps with tips for picky eaters. How to get your kids to eat the foods you want them to eat with them knowing it."
2,Don't expect anything high quality.,"I've bought this a few years ago, and tried to use it with my Canon EOS 40D, with Sigma 10-20 f/4-5.6 lens. The filter does pass the infrared light as it's supposed to, but the quality of the resulting image is horrible. I definitely recommendHoya 77mm R-72 Infrared Filterinstead of this one. Two stars for at least doing what it says, otherwise it would be one star."
1,low quality,"I guess you get what you pay for. I am not able to get a clear image. I set to manual, focus, install filter, and it's still blurry. The images also look more like a dark red filter more than anything. Also the filter requires a much longer exposure. The sample pictures show ducks in flight. I don't see how this is possible."
1,Waste of money,Buy this product only if you want it for decoration. We had a green heron use the alligator head for a perch to better look for our fish. We installed a net over the pond and that stopped the heron. This product is a waste of money.
1,Did not work,"I purchased this scale and have yet to get any kind of number. Everytime I (or anyone) gets on the scale it says ""Err"". Now, in the troubleshooting section of the instructions, it says that if you exceed the 330lb weight limit, you will get this message. I am only 180 lbs. My two year old is only 32 lbs and it gave her the same message. This product is junk. Waste of money."
1,Platform cracked after 4 months,"I only weigh 180, but the plastic cracked right in the middle on the rear of the platform after just 4 months of daily use. I always step on it gently, and stand on the gray foot pads. After it cracked, I soon realized that standing on the gray pads isn't centering your weight on the unit, and does indeed put more pressure on the plastic frame in the back, since there is nothing to support it there. I can still use it, sort of, if I stand directly in the middle of the unit (ignoring the gray pads, and leaving my toes on the white part by the digital readout), but I get less accurate readings this way. I see no point in taking advantage of the lifetime warranty, because the new one would probably break again just as easily -- why bother with the hassle?"
1,horribly inaccurate,"Not sure how/why they are still selling this scale. I bought mine a while ago and thought it was a bit off. It stopped working about a month after buying it so I replaced the battery and hoped it would be more accurate, but it is still wildly unreliable."
1,worst scale i've ever owned,"I bought this scale because the package claimed it was very accurate and had all sorts of precision and accuracy. Not sure what they're talking about since every time I use it the weight readings I get back vary by 6lbs in the same 3 minutes I'm using it. Absolutely horrible, good scale to get a ballpark figure for your weight, but not the choice for people who are trying to accurately keep track of weight/weight loss progress."
1,Ridiculously bad,"I can step off, step right back on, and get a FIFTEEN POUND variance. This isn't your five pound a day, morning vs night argument. Half the time, when I stand on it, it won't give any reading - the numbers will run back and forth, and then it will go blank. Flat floor, carpet, wood, tile, doesn't matter. We have tried everything we can to get this to give a consistent reading - as in, at least within 3 pounds the same in five minutes - and no go. I have no idea if I've gained 20 pounds from when I bought it two months ago or lost 10, or if I'm the same weight! Absolutely useless. I'm finally writing this report because today was the last straw when it gave me a reading that was 22 pounds different immediately after standing on it. It's time for a new scale and a new brand."
2,Functional at Best!,"Compared to the other consumers who have written terrible reviews, my experience hasn't been quite as bad. My scale works(worked), but it does give out different readings one after the other. Usually if you stand on it about three times in a row you can get a good idea of your weight which is good enough for my purposes.I noticed in the description that it suggests the battery may last forever, but my battery lasted about a year and a half. I came to this site trying to find out it it gave any indication of where to buy replacement batteries because I would hate to buy the wrong kind. After reading the other reviews I may just replace my scale."
1,Inconsistent readings,This scale gives wildly inconsistent readings. It varies by as much as 4 pounds depending on what part of the room it is in. You can't even get a reliable 2 out of 3 readings because they vary so much! I bought this scale when it was just $15. Now they're charging more for it??
2,Not for the weight-sensative,"The style of this particular bathroom scale is up to standards, but like with non-digital scales (< forget what the word is there) the number changes everytime you move, breathe, and or step off and get back on. Honestly, I regret buying this scale."
2,Lacrosse Ball,"good product, but purchased for my 6 year old grandson; and it was too hard/heavy for his lacrosse stick. More appropriate for older players."
4,standard issue,This item is fine. How can you go wrong on a lacrosse ball?I bought two and use them for back massage.
5,OMG This movie is hilarious.,"Yes, it appears low quality.Yes it is a bit... for lack of a better word ""cheesy.""But,YES it makes my son HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!andYES it makes me laugh so hard!!!!!!!!!!!!!andHas anyone else looked at the characters and thought to themselves ""South Park?"" HAHA... OMG, Seriously, cute!"
4,A superb effort!!!!,"I know it seams like I am easy but I tend to wan to write only for CD's that are really great.This is definitely a 4 to 5 star effort by gums who has been a reliable sideman over years but known mostly to other musicians.I can't understand why there are so many used copies of this.Can't remember horn man extra percussionist right now but you can look them up at www.amg.com.This is great and when you see the list of modern classics you really should pick it up.It is not hard charger but defintely not ""smooth jazz"".I though I might be taking chance as this was my first Gumbs CD as leader but was pleasantly surprised and it won't be my last.Peace"
1,Buy Another Book,"Don't waste your time and money buying this book. It is seriously out of date. Many of the companies listed have moved or gone out of business. She has tear-out postcards for mailing to list distributors or consumer databases. I had to double check every address on the internet, and many had changed. The best internet source for up-to-date business addresses seems to be the Better Business Bureau (BBB).I thought this book would tell you the inner workings of the consumer mailing list industry, but all she says is that there are 50,000 different mailing lists out there, and you can get off of some of them by sending out the postcards attached in the book.Buy another book instead of this one."
4,Useful and practical,"I like practical things, and this is one of those. This charger works great for me, and charges my batteries in less than one hour what comes to be an advantage at the time of use."
3,Gets HOT but still works,"ENERGIZER CHD-CA: I am not sure if it is something that is wrong with the charger, or the batteries, or if it is just normal. But the batteries get super HOT. The light stays on, so I assume it is still charging, but this is probably not the smarter unit that knows how to turn itself off. Still, it serves as a simple backup when others have failed. It is still working after 3 years, unlike my Sanyo NC-MQH01U Super Quick Charger that died on us after 3 years. Oh, and I like how it closes up and makes it compact to pack.Update: I found a secret flip-out that allows me to charge AAA batteries. So, I would like to change the star-rating to a 4.5. Not a 5, because it does overheat if left in the outlet for too long."
4,Worked fine for me - even overseas,"I bought this charger this summer in preparation for a trip to Europe. We recharged batteries several times while overseas (220V/50Hz), and it worked fine. No problems with the batteries so far after several recharges."
2,Someone forgot to pre-charge the batteries,"Someone was asleep with testing and packaging these batteries, which were dead. The charger didn't seem to be working either after an overnight charging session. It was one of those rare lemons with Energizer, which other batteries I bought were perfectly fine. I'll wait for a fresh shipment before reordering this!"
5,Super economical AND efficient!,"This is great, I bought these batteries for my daughter's VREADER. They have worked perfectly! The batteries work even longer than the nonrechargable duracels. She uses her vreader probably 4 hours out of a given day and they die about the end of that. I put them on the charger at night and they are ready by morning for her to use again. I have now bought a second set for some of her other electronic toys and will be buying a few more sets come christmas. super handy to have!"
3,There is a bug,"Thre is a bug that makes this charger stop charging batteries before they are full. Unplug it and plug again will get the job done, but that is too annoying."
2,Pretty terrible self-discharge rate,"I have bought approximately 12 of these batteries, and have 2 different Energizer chargers. These batteries are never charged when I reach for them less than a month later. The batteries also don't work in certain high-drain devices, such as a remote controlled car. I am really disappointed in them, and they were pretty expensive."
3,energizer does not recommend overseas use :(,Energizer does not recommend using their US chargers overseas :(minus 2 stars for not being able to use internationally.NOTE: no mention in description or package.Just on energizer's website:[...]#9. Can Energizer chargers be used overseas with an adapter?We do not recommend using our chargers that are designed for US power (120 volts AC at 60 HZ) in foreign countries that have a different power supply. Using overseas voltage adapters can result in permanent damage to charger or wall plug adapter circuitry.
1,Bad Design!,"The batteries work well, BUT the charger can only charge in multiples of two, making you have to charge more batteries than you need to if you only need to charge an odd number. That's probably bad for the batteries. Many toys etc. now require odd numbers of batteries, and you can't charge odd numbers of batteries! Very disappointing. Also, there's only one battery charge indicator light for all four batteries, so detecting problems in one or two batteries is difficult."
1,Buyer beware,"I opened the package and plugged in the unit, following all instructions. The batteries never charged, i tried moving them to different outlets, even tried an old charger. Still the batteries did not charge. I asked for and received a refund."
2,Malfunctions,This charger is very sensitive and malfunctions periodically where it won't charge even Energizer batteries let alone other brands. The lights just blink constantly as if the batteries are defective but they aren't because they charge on another charger. Plus the batteries that came with it didn't last very long. Won't buy Energizer products again.
3,Catches the spirit of a real reunion,"I have liked this film for years. While it's not a great film, it catches, and sometimes spoofs every reunion that you've been to. The guy living on past glories, the faded beauties, the nerd making it good, and the slick con artist. Laura Flynn Boyle is great, and I love the dark humor of her character."
4,"Very, very funny!","This is the epitome of high school reunion films. If you ever wondered what yours could be like, you should watch this movie. There is a wide range of characters to follow, all doing different things with their lives, with different agendas and goals. David Schwimmer is actually very funny, and Lara Flynn Boyle's character is hilariously evil. I would definitely recommend watching this movie--there is great dialogue."
1,Worth one viewing...,"This movie is really pretty corny, and I'm not up for over-the-top humour...but if you are then maybe you'll like this movie more. Some parts are too expected, others are just plain crazy, but it's entertaining enough to watch once."
4,You deserve good things!,"Hilarious! This is a great high school reunion film with dark comedy. I thought David Schwimmer did a great job with it. I've shown this film to several friends, promising them they'd enjoy it. No one I know had heard of it, but everyone I've shown the film to enjoyed it. You have to pay attention throughout the film; there's laughs in alot of little details. If you don't, you'll miss them. I've shown it to several different people, so I've seen it several times~ but I never get tired of it.If you like the type of humor in Drop Dead Gorgeous and Lucky Numbers, you'll enjoy this film. You won't be disappointed."
1,You could write a better book on this subject,I can't remember the last time I read a book with so little content
1,A grandly fabricated bood,"This book does not make any reasonable arguements. Nor does it support it claims. I implore you not to purchase this book. It really is not good. Though, If you wish to read a bunch of fabrication, be my guest and buy this book. It is really quite absurd, the ideas that are pushed in this book."
5,Something for everyone,"Davis does a great job of capturing not only the voices of young kids (and some pretty interesting adults, for that matter), but also the wide emotional swings -- one minute you resent the new kid on the block, the next you're best friends, and back again. Evangeline Brown -- oops, ""Eddie"" -- will break your heart and make you grin ear to ear. The story is refreshing in its ability to find hope despite hardship, without descending into sappiness. As Eddie says, that perfect place somewhere over the rainbow may not really exist, but sometimes you just have to make your own rainbows.I've already bought copies for my nieces, and if I can just convince my nephew to read a book about a girl, I'm pretty sure he'll like it, too."
3,"""Boulevard"" Not the Smoothest Ride","While the book starts off fairly promising, it becomes hard to follow with later chapters taking the points of view of other characters that aren't nearly as interesting as Newell. I find myself not remembering many parts of the book shortly after reading it - including the ending."
2,Not Up to Par,"I loved Grimsley's other novels and could not wait for this one. It started out very well and then it just went off into directions that held little interest. I tried to keep reading, but after a while I just didn't care anymore."
4,I liked it.,"I've read all of Jim Grimsley's books and my favorite is ""My Drowning."" His latest book is called ""Boulevard"" and, while not his best, is certainly worth reading and should interest those who have already read and liked some of his earlier work. I think it is the best (or anyway the one I like best) of his ""gay-themed"" novels. Jim Grimsley takes what could have been a tired theme (an innocent young man in the big city in the anything-goes 1970s) and makes it fresh and compelling--interesting from start to finish."
3,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Jim Grimsley after having read great books like ""Dream Boy"" and ""Comfort and Joy."" There's something very wistful about those books, and you immediately connect with the characters. However, in this book, even after over half the novel, I find myself not caring what happens to anyone in the story. The writing is still nice, but it seems really aimless. If you haven't read a Grimsley novel, I suggest you buy Comfort and Joy."
5,Sexy story of a boy from Alabama,"I could not put this book down. Great story and even better characters. Explores life in New Orleans during the late 70s and it is quite the bizarre.. full of sensous moments and characters that are deeper than their appearance, I highly recommend this book."
3,Elegant writing but lesser Grimsley,"This latest novel by Jim Grimsley is a coming-of-age tale about Newell, a naive young man from Alabama who moves to New Orleans and gradually comes to terms with his sexuality. The book is filled with Grimsley's characteristic elegant prose. His skill in evoking the feel of a locale is remarkable--the sights, tastes, sounds and even smells of New Orleans come vividly to life for the reader. However, Grimsley's ability to draw complete characters becomes a liability in this work, as about halfway through Newell's story is relegated to the sidelines in favor of following the lives of other colorful but subsidiary denizens of the seedy demimonde of the Latin Quarter. A belated attempt to resolve the central tale results in a rushed and unsatisfactory conclusion. Still, the incidental pleasures of the author's prose are enough to make this a worthwhile read."
1,failure,"these headphones were great at first, but then failed (right ear stopped working) after 3 months. I sent the orginal pair back to the manufacturer for a replacement, but the replacement pair also failed with the same problem after a couple more months. Stay away from these."
4,good but,"Like the shoe but need to invest in a shoe horn. Very hard to get into but once on, very comfortable."
1,Scuffed,The shoes showed up with a large scuff on one shoe. They looked like someone had wore them before.The scuff had scraped away the leather down to a large white mark. Return!
1,Poor workmanship,I am not sure how these are made but the sole split (more like broke)straight across at the ball of the foot after only a couple months of wear. Not like I go jogging in them or anything. Well made shoes should not do that.
3,eastland,"Nice light weight shoe, decent support but not much more. finish looks good. They must run narrow I bought the Wide and they were none to gracious in width. Soles look more plastic then rubber, but they seem to cushion none the less. Time will tell, but seem like a good purchase on a budget."
4,"Funny, Funny, Funny","I love this book. I've read it about 10 times and I laugh every time. It's not the best written book, or the most original, but it is downright hilarious. I think my favorite part is when Pitt borrows ""cousin Carlos'"" rather too large shorts!I recommend this book for ages 8-15. It's great when you're feeling a little depressed; it'll cheer you right up!"
3,Generic Hijinks,"This received awards as a good book for ""reluctant readers"". I'm never sure what reluctant reader books are, but I suspect they are supposed to be simple and predictable with a little bit of silliness and whatever is viewed as boy-appeal, (farts?, dogs?, sword fights?).Well, this book is perfectly fine. The hero is engaging, the situations are G-rated, there is some humor and some action. It's not memorable and not particularly compelling, but it makes for reasonable reading and provides a decent stepping stone between kiddie books and more grownup fare.So, everything can't be a classic and reading this would be a fine way to spend an afternoon."
3,Took Amazon a while to figure out this is not the printer.,"Like others, I went through two toner cartridges trying to buy the printer before Amazon realized they were advertising a printer and selling toner cartridges.I like amazon a lot, but criminy, they sure can be dense."
1,Don't be fooled -- this is not a printer!!!,Amazon needs to fix their website. This product has no picture and the description would lead you to believe it is a printer. It is in fact the toner refill for the printer -- not the printer. The only way you would know this is by typing the printer model number (KX-P7305) into the search bar and this product shows up with 2 other toner refill products. The refill product number for this printer is KX-PDP10. Do a seach for this refill product and guess what? ...this refill masquerading as a printer shows up without a picture. The previous reviewer also had the same problem yet Amazon hasn't fixed the problem yet.
1,I would rather be home crying,"This book would be awsome, if I were still attending junior high school, in the suburbs. Gary Benchley is for kids who aspire to be a cliche. The characters in this book are as original and developed as a Sim. I would rather be home crying than reading this poopie book."
5,Fatso - Quick Review,"One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. If you are Italian and have a sense of humor, you'll probably enjoy this film. If you're not Italian, and you have a good sense of humor, you still enjoy the film."
3,"""Fatso"" the Movie starring Dom Delouise",Years later still a funny and touching movie starring Dom Delouise as an overweight Italian momma's boy who finds love while eating his way through life.
4,Funny Classic,"For anybody that has ever had a weight problem, you will identify with this movie, just so funny."
4,One of the all-time great food movies...,"I cannot understand how the reviewers missed this one for lists of food movies. The food in this movie is wonderful. The acting is good, and the lines are superb. ""Get the honey, Junior"" is one of cinema's underrated classics.However, it does have one failing that it shares with ""Who is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe"" (another wonderful movie about food); they BOTH need to be available on DVD."
5,fatso,"it seems that not many people know about this film- thats a shame because it is a riot. It's one of those handfull of movies that you can quote lines and scences from for years. I guess it helps to enjoy the film if you are Italian and from the area the movie takes place in. I dont know what scene is funnier; The scene where Dom holds his brother at knife point to get into the refridgerator he put a padlock on, or the scene where the fat support group (Like AA for obese people) comes to help Dom and the 3 of them snap and end up eating everthing imaginable. _GET THE HONEY JUNIOR ! ---Anyone Know of a site that has sound bytes of this film?"
4,I couldn't help but be entertained,"This movie is charming and I couldn't help but be entertained by Dom D.'s acting. He plays a fat man (really he's not that fat in the movie, more like chubby) who struggles with his addiction to food. He goes on a strict diet, but it only fuels his hunger until he falls in love. Dom D. cries a lot in this movie and talks about food a lot. He does a pretty good job of making you hungry. I have to admit that while watching it I had cravings for donuts, cake and ice cream. Dom D. makes the movie worth buying."
5,I ain't eating it...I'm just smelling it!,"What a movie for all of us who have spent most of our lives dieting! I'm sure this movie is enjoyed more by Italians who are so familiar with this way of life. Who hasn't dipped their bread in the sauce while it's cooking!! My family and I love this movie, and Dom D.is histerical. The writing was great."
5,"Great seller, Movie stunk","The seller was great, quick shipping & move was brand new, the movie itself was horrable, don't buy it but feel free to buy from this seller, they're great!!!!!"
1,The worst move I've ever scene - really,"Not only is this the worst move I've EVER scene, but in my 25 years since seeing it - no other movie even threatened this title for me. I saw this in the theater - and I remember everyone walking out about half way through. My girlfriend and I were the only ones left in our local theatre. I'm not sure why we stayed - but money was tight so I'm guessing I was praying it would get better. It never did. I eventually got over it - after a few months of therapy. Whenever I see a really bad flick - I always tell myself ""at least it's not Fatso."""
5,Favorite funny movie,"An old film(1980's) but my favorite funny movie--some strong language in the first few scenes,but with only one character-and doesn't continue for rest of film. About the fight with obesity and dieting--don't watch this film hungry!---lots of pictures of great food! About a serious topic(especially today with so many obese people ),but a ""nice story"" about an Italian family.Finally,great to have my own copy of this film!"
4,Hilarious movie but where's the Closed Caption?,"We have older family members who would love this movie,too, but they are hard of hearing...I thought all DVDs had to be Closed Captioned by law. Anyway, I love the movie and would give it 5 stars if it was CC. This film deserves a ""Special Edition"" with commentary by the still living actors, and also by Mel Brooks (plus be Closed Captioned)."
5,Real Italians,"I grew up in an Italian Household in North Jersey. Forget the Godfather, The Sopranos, This is the true Picture of Italian Households!"
5,Our Family Favorite,"We love this movie; watching it is a family tradition. Of course, Dom is great, Anne Bancroft is a genius, but everyone else is perfectly natural and memorable as well. Every scene, every line is intense, just like life in a big, loving family. Who can forget: ""He ate the 'ony!"" ""She's everything, she's Catholic, she's half-Italian and she's blonde!"" ""Get the honey, Junior"" ""I ate the whole thing!"" You just have to have this movie so you can watch it whenever life is getting you down."
4,A good start...,"This is a good book for putting together a government résumé, but it stops short of going through the entire government process. There is not adequate information on KSA writing and putting together a total government-ready package. For this level of material, the book nudges you toward using the publisher's consulting / writing service, which is on the expensive side depending on what positions you are going after.Overall, it's a good book to get started with. You may need additional help down the road, though."
2,Federal Resume Guidebook,"The Federal Resume Guidebook is more for those who have never ever created a resume on the federal government job website than it is for assisting with writing with KSAs. In my opinion, this book is a really basic book for only those who are new to computers. Luckily, I checked this book out at my local library, because it was not at all what I was looking for. The book shows readers what a typical website job listing on the fed's website looks like, as well as, the screen for the resume builder. The book displays several general resumes to give it's buyers ideas on what to place on their resumes. As far as KSAs, the book encourages you to look deep at your work history and skills and how to best formulate it into a KSA. It was a waste of time for me."
4,Federal Resume Guidance,"This book has been a godsend to me. I had been submitting resumes for government postitions only to find out after reading this book that they were not in the format the government looks for. I am currently working on restructuring my resume using the guidebook as a reference. It is an excellent resource!!!Federal Resume Guidebook: Strategies for Writing a Winning Federal Electronic Resume, KSAs, and Essays, 4th Edition"
5,Execellent Resource and Advice,I learned of Kathryn Troutman's books from a current federal employee who used these to help get a position with the government. I have used Kathryn Toroutman's books to completely rethink and rewrite my resume and application responses for federal positions. Her books are excellent aids to anyone thinking of working for the federal government. Well worth every penny.
2,Waste of time and money,"Two stars is generous. It's a shame the information provided is incomplete, especially since it's done on purpose as a way of hawking their other services and books. Based on their relationship with the Washington Post, I figured they provided a valuable and quality service. Nope. The resume writing process included a strong sales pitch for the books. If more than 5 words were changed from my original resume to the completed resume, I'd be shocked. Additionally, they currently have a D- ranking with the BBB. Too bad I didn't look before I leaped, save your money and use google to improve upon your resume."
5,United We Stand !,"If you want to fully understand and comprehend thesteps that must be taken in order to apply for,interview and be hired by the Federal Governmentthis book is a must read !This book is expansive yet it provides enough detailfor the reader to comprehend.Kathryn Kraemer Troutman - Thank you for writing this book!"
2,outdated,"This version of this book is extremely outdated. The book was written before the restructuring/consolidation of USAJOBS as the main source for federal employment, before President Obama made changes to the hiring process, and before the competition for government positions became so fierce (ex: the global financial crisis, the end of the war and veteran's preferences for those who completed service in Iraq). It is apparent that the author does know the ins and outs of the federal hiring process but, I'm not sure if a lot of the suggestions she makes in this particular version of the book are applicable to the current system of hiring. In particular, I wish there was more information about hiring preferences that impact if your resume is even read, and how to make your application stand out from the (literally) hundreds of other applicants. I'm not sure if the updated version of this book is beneficial, but I would say, skip this version."
1,Serious lack of editing,"Amazon really has no business selling this copy of Theosophy. Some of the pages are nothing but letters, not even words. I ended up ordering a better version from Steiner books. Wish I had known what a terrible edition this copy was and saved myself the money."
1,Stay away from this edition,"This is a review of the General Books edition of Teosophy, and not of the content of Teosophy itself. The General Books edition (at $8 here on Amazon) is obviously a scanned version of the book, with no apparent proof reading after the text recognition (OCR) was done. The result is a book with lots of typos, and some pages are pure garble. Reading Steiner is hard enough, so stay away from this edition unless you totally have to save the few extra dollars to get a read-through version."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS VERSION OF THE BOOK!!! READ MY REVIEW!!!,"This book was made by scanning an original version and then binding the scanned copy. They say they do this because it keeps the cost down which is fine by me. The problem is, if you have ever scanned a document you will find that the words in the scanned document often get jumbled and the document has to be edited so the sentences can be corrected. THEY DID NOT EDIT THIS BOOK. I REPEAT, THEY DID NOT EDIT THIS BOOK. They say they did not edit this book so that they can keep the cost down. I DID NOT FIND THIS OUT UNTIL AFTER I BOUGHT THE BOOK AND READ THE DISCLAIMER THAT IS WRITTEN INSIDE. Reading Rudolf Steiner is complicated enough but try understanding a book where the sentences are jumbled up and make no sense. AMAZON SHOULD STOP SELLING THIS PARTICULAR VERSION OF THE BOOK."
5,Everything you should know,This book has everything about the business I'd recommend it. Great pictures and tips on the business side difenitly read before tring.
4,"Start your own ""At Home"" Adult Toy Business...EASY!","A good reference book to have for those interested in starting (or looking to improve) their own ""adult toy"" parties. Well written and a good read, even the more basic information is presented in a clever way with a ""think outside of the box"" mentality. The book is inspirational & witty without being pretentious. Lots of really good ideas!Can't wait to put it to good use!"
3,A Must read for beginners,I think this was a o.k book on the toy party industry and I recommend it to those starting out in the business and need some idea or base in which to start. I learned a few things from it but as you advanced and need more training and understanding a source I would recommend is [...]
1,Terrible,"In my haste, I thought I was purchasing a video of the family-friendly board game Chutes and Ladders. I should have paid more attention. This movie had nothing at all to do with Chutes and Ladders."
4,Lest We Forget,"Well, I must say, the topic of this book did not particularly appeal to me. However, I happen to know the author and so I was very curious. Ms. Hagstrom is an excellent writer, who tells a story with clarity of detail. Now that I have, indeed, finished the book, I know I will never forget the horrors of the holocaust. It is truly miraculous that these five siblings survived. What courage and strength!"
5,"A compelling, worthy story","""Sara's Children"" is a compelling story about five siblings who survived the Holocaust. Yet, their immediate family was not untouched: both parents and two other siblings were murdered by the regime.I read this book after having re-read Viktor Frankl's ""Man's Search for Meaning."" I followed it by reading ""Night"" by Elie Weisel. ""Sara's Children"" tells a story as shocking to the conscience as any narrative."
5,Thank God They Survived to Tell,"Suzan Hagstrom has but human faces on five of the children that struggled through the bigotry, horrible slavery, and the death marches of the Holocaust. They were torn from their parents (who did not survive) and, being Jewish, these children were constantly beat and tortured. But this is a true story, of a very rare survival. I'm grateful that Sara's Children were willing to tell Suzan Hagstrom of their years of the Holocaust, a time we must never forget!"
5,Sara's Children,"This well crafted story of a family from Chmielnik, Poland captivates without being overly sentimental. The book describes their life before the war and their subsequent experiences in the death camps. Polish place names are used frequently, but always explained and referenced so that the reader does not become mired in an unfamiliar language. While the other books I have read about the Holocaust tended to be highly dramatic, the direct journalistic style of this narrative made the experiences of the Garfinkels most realistic. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to get a sense of the times which led up to and included the Holocaust."
5,Unforgetable Historical Tale,"Sara's Children is an unforgetable lesson and demonstration of human endurance, compassion and evil.In the telling of the miraculous survival of the holocaust by 5 siblings, the author, Suzan Hagstrom, has spared the reader much detailed graphic horror of the holocaust making the book bearable reading for the faint at heart. As a child growing up during World War II in a military town, I heard whipsers of the Jews disappearing in Europe, saw accounts in the newsreels at the local movie theatre and feared to read and/or see it again.Suzan Hagstrom did a beautiful job of making the reading of this brave family and their survival a memorable experience. A must read to learn of a terrible time in history and the unbeleivable capacity of man's inhumanity to man."
5,How five siblings unite to survive,"Sara's Children brought tears to my eyes and hope to my heart. How these five children helped each other survive through the years of World War II is an inspiring story. The discussion of their close-knit family prior to the war and the love of their mother, Sara, is touching. As the Rabbi said, parents want their children to live. Sara would have been so proud that her five children helped and supported each other to survive this terrible time. As a mother, I felt for her."
4,Sara's Children - Lest We Forget,"As a veterans of WWII, an inveterate reader, writer of a long college essay on ethnocentrism, and long-time friend of many Jewish citizens I found Sara's Children to be a thoroughly researched and very readable exposition of one family's endurance of a horrible time in history. I can't say I enjoyed the book, but I don't think it was written for enjoyment but for exposure of the facts and feelings. I fear the horror of the death camps is already forgotten."
5,Sara's Children: The Destruction of Chmielnick,"My mother, born in Chmielnick,and father in Krakow, were survivors of the Holocaust. Growing up in Toronto, Canada, I was told about some of the horrific times they endured, but reading Suzan Hagstrom's novel, ""Sara's Children"", gave me a more thorough and vivid understanding of what they truly went through. Reading about the Holocaust is very difficult and trying, but Suzan's manner of writing makes it possible to appreciate some of what my parents experienced during that terrible time in their lives.""Sara's Children"" helped me understand things my parents would not or could not express. Everyone,Jew or Gentile, should read this book."
4,Sara's Children,"I have read Suzan Hagstrom's ""Sara's Children: The Destruction of Chmielnik."" Even though the subject of the Holocaust is horrifying, the survival of Sara's children is amazing. Susan wrote their story in a straight forward manner, showing that their love and devotion to one another in trying times helped in their survival. Susan should be commended on her research and writing.Sincerely,Barbara Eller"
1,Horrible,another corny lead single&More dissing which is played out. the Production is the same as His Previous lead in singles for Projects. nothing ever changes with this Cat.Boring&Vastly Overrated.
2,Forgettable,I lost respect for Marshall Mathers with this song. A juvenile delinquent attempt at trying to diss Michael Jackson and gaining 6+ year old fans. The song itself is no good with the same start borrowed from his last album. It sounds boring 10 seconds into it.He tries his best to mix it all up with a trademark stupid video.I don't think I'm a fan anymore.
1,predictable,"Eminem is so talented, but his first singles of every new album he puts out are so predictable. Just Lose It is just another reincarnation of Without Me. The Real Slim Shady and My Name Is were a little less formulaic. I love Encore, but Eminem needs to quite writing his first singles for the masses. I have all of Eminem's albums including Infinite and Slim Shady LP. He is so intelligent and has so much to say that I find this single his weakest he has ever done. The rest of Encore is amazing and original, but I could do without this song. Em, you da man, but quite being a sellout with your lead singles, you are better than that."
5,Just perfect,"We bought this CD to play in our daughter's nursery when she was born. I have never heard such a soothing, peaceful, and beautiful set of songs to play for relaxing and sleeping. Fred Mollin has taken familiar songs and made them into soft, lovely lullabies, they all sound brand-new. Each song is so simply produced, but the simplicity is what makes each song so peaceful. I still cannot listen to ""Love Me Tender"" with a dry eye.You will love this CD for your baby, child, and for yourself."
3,Good book for introductory course,"This is a good book for an Management Science course book which does not go deep into theory. Primarily its good for business majors, however there are better books for business majors who dont want to be involved with the math using Excel exclusively. Ragsdales book comes to mind.However, there are plenty problems solved and so if you are one of those people who learn through solving problems this is a decent book.For theory and math pick Bazraas book on LP and NLP or Model Building by Paul Williams which I think is an excellent book."
2,Use 5th edition if possible,"My professor recommend the 5th edition of this book as one reference book of the optimization course. Since I cannot find the 5th edition, I use the 6th edition. I found too many errors in the book, calculations of some examples are wrong, many answers are not correct, there are also printing errors. Maybe the 5th edition is really better?"
2,"Can you say ""New Agey?""","I do believe that people form strong spiritual bonds with each other and animals too. I also believe we can sense things intuitvely when we're close to someone. HOWEVER, this book is a little wacho and new agey. You know the drill. . . 'We are one with nature"" type book. No thanks!!!"
2,Truth is the first Victim,"The book is quick on conclusions. It avoids any analysis of archeological finds that do not accord with such conclusions. The fact of the matter is that much evidence support the 'traditional' story of Islam, in particular in the Fertile Crescent where archeological finds have not contradicted the 'traditional' story.The fact that no such digs where ever conducted in the birthplace of the entire movement is regrettable. Incidently, Mecca should prove a veritabley exciting site, given the fact that it had been on a trade route for probably hundred of years before Mohammed's time.The search for answers to these questions, without theological or (much worse) political motives seems hard to expect in the present time. As usual, ""Truth is the first victim"" of the current tragic events."
1,Not a good buy,"the girls were pretty in the film, but do not get the unrated the idea that you will see a bunch of nudity. In fact there was just one scene. I have to agree, the acting was pretty bad and not funny bad as you seen in adult movies. But it is a waste of money."
4,Nobody knows me.,"I never liked this song, and only bought the cd single for the Nobody knows me remixes.I am glad that I did, as there are 2 great remixes of the song on this cd single.They are:1 Mount Sims Italo Kiss mix.2 Peter Rauflofers private life part 1.This cd single is a great buy simply for the Nobody knows me remixes I mentioned, and the Above and Beyond remix is quite good also.Excellent buy for any Madonna fan."
5,"""ABOVE AND BEYOND"", the music will take you there...!","The first to reviewer obviously, have no taste in the current trends of uplifting progressive trance. I must admit, I was getting a bit overdrawn a bit with a bit of the too much influenced tech-house/hip-hop influence on her previous remixes...The last amazingly ""TRANCE"" influenced remix was of ""What If Feels Like For a Girl"" by the European trance producer gem ""ABOVE AND BEYOND"", and it is the Above and Beyond 12""Remix on this cd maxi-single that stands out to be the best!..I just pray and hope that Madonna continues to provide more styles of uplifting trance remixes in the future as well...well here are some future suggestions:e.g. Paul Van Dyk, Tiesto, Ferry Corsten, Armin Van Buuren, Svenson and Gielen(Airscape), Alex Gold..."
3,Bonus Trax Making It Up For Its Feature Presentation...,"Personally, the original album cut of Nothing Fails is good enough alone, and should never have been remixed. Few of the remix versions of the song on this maxi-single are worth collecting while most of them simply fail to fit the nature of the song. However, the bonus remixes of Nobody Knows Me kind of make it up for the title track of the single, very retro yet creatively renovated. Had not been for these bonus cuts, this could have been the worst Madonna maxi-single release since Human Nature. I would suggest people skip this CD unless you are truly die-hard fans of Madonna."
2,The album versions are better,"Unlike most Madonna fans, I think ""American Life"" is a brilliant album and ""Nothing Fails"" is a moving ballad that people should give a serious listen to. This CD-single, however, is full of bland, generic, tired club beats. Sadly, these remixes add nothing to these 2 songs. There is nothing here that will send you running to the dancefloor, like ""Ray of Light"" and other favorites once did.I used to love Madonna's club mixes, but her last few remix singles have just left me cold (""Hollywood"" is gathering dust on my shelf). Maybe her music with Mirwais is just too techno-based as it is to warrant having their songs remixed. I'd rather hear the album versions."
5,Excellent Book for Understanding the Gift of the Holy Spirit,This is an excellent book to help understand the gift of the Holy Spirit. This topic is not covered in many sermons and finding quality teaching on it is difficult. I am a fan of Mr. Hagin and he has done it again with this book. He backs up the facts of this book with scriptures to give both new believers and older christians insight into the workings of the Holy Spirit.
5,Good !,I enjoyed this book.It was jammed packed with information. I had to read this bookfor a school paper I was researching.
3,GOOD SERVICE,"HAPPY FOR THE BOOK AND REALLY ENJOY THE BOOK ,I AM SO BLESS WITH IT ,AND THE SERVICE WAS FINE"
3,its ok,"Angels and the Holy Spirit can be activated when we pray, I have felt the power, and best of all I have felt the power flow thorugh me into other people. In one case of demon possesed girl. I felt power blast out of my hands and light up the room. she was deliverd and baptised...God is Great. Jesus is GREAT..believer can say JESUS and cut through demons..and the chains"
1,Unpleasantly Suprised,"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this book, but imagined that there might be some sort of story associated with the drawings. Instead of a story, the general theme is nothing but naked young women in various jungle poses. Most of the women are attractive, but they are all black and white pencil drawings. Some are very artistic and well done, but others are not. I was particularly disturbed by one drawing of a woman perched on a tree branch urinating. We all could do without that image. I saw nothing artistic, attractive, or even funny about it. Overall, this purchase was a colossal disappointment and is not worth the money that I spent. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Elizabeth the Golden Age,"This movie had a good quality picture,but it was cut down from the original version.This made it very disappointing to me."
2,Boring,Thats what I thought of this movie the end. Picture quality is very nice. Will work on an Xbox 360 HD DVD player.
2,"Poor history, nice visuals","Costumes were beautiful, Blanchett was worth watching most of the time & other actors were pretty decent, but the history sucked and for such a strong female character, they sure made her look petty & idiotic at times. Also, why do so many movies turn Spain into the evil character? The portrayal of King Phillip was pretty absurd & really made the movie laughable. (the movie Amistad really used Spain as a scapegoat, too, when England did it's fair share in the slave trade.) Elizabeth I had a lot more to her life, boiling it down to just a bad romance is a pretty big disservice."
2,A few brief thoughts...,"I don't have much to say here so I'm going to try something new. I'm going to use a single sentence to convey my thoughts on each facet of this film.The Script:A confused history lesson delves into campy soap operatic tones that snuff out the more interesting bits.The Direction:A total step backward from its grittier 1998 predecessor, Kapur tries to add too much gloss and loses his core along the way.The Acting:Clive Owen is a joke, Abbie Cornish can't act, Cate Blanchett is shocking bland and unfocused and Samantha Morton steals the whole show with a handful of scenes (she's amazing).The Technical:Some overblown visuals look cheesy and fake, but the costumes are divine and the texture of the set pieces are organic and splendid to look at.In the end I hope that they stop here. I loved the 1998 film, and Blanchett in it, but this was a disaster that failed on nearly every level, the Oscar winning costumes aside."
3,"Nice to look at, boring to sit through","The costumes and props in this movie were incredible. I enjoyed the first Elizabeth movie, so I thought I'd enjoy the sequel. And it starts off promising - but it quickly became tedious and boring. I'm a history buff, I love history movies. But I did not love this one. It had a good amount of historical inaccuracies, and the script was plodding. I let out a sigh of relief when it was over."
2,does not live up to my hopes,"I loved the first movie, Elizabeth. The Golden Age, however, does not live up to my hopes of a solid sequel. Though it shares the same general look as its predacessor and some continuity of the characters and their personal story lines, it is much less polished. Though the love Elizabeth had for Bess was evident, I did not feel any believable chemistry between Elizabeth and Walter. Cate Blanchett is a great actress but I felt the movie was cut in such a way that the queen appears to be a flurry of emotion shifting in every which direction and hardly having the time for it to soak-in between frames. The scenes needed to be longer or else more cleverly melded together to build the appropriate tension and further develop the characters. The gory scenes only appeared to add to the problem of time - taking precious minutes away from what would have drawn me more into the plot. It was frustrating to watch this movie after the masterpiece that came before it."
2,"The ""Golden Age"" has lost its luster",The sequel to Elizabeth I has been long awaited only to leave me disappointed. I give the film 2 stars due to a watered down plot that was drug out and unimpressive. The 2 stars are for Cate Blanchett and the extraordinary display of costume. They may have well put their money where their mouth is with a better script.
4,Superb Acting but Little Historical Accuracy.,"The acting, costumes, and set designs are exquisite in this move. If you are not a history buff and are just looking for a drama full of superb acting (especially CB as Elizabeth) and supreme coustumes, then you will enjoy this movie. For those that pick apart historical dramas for accuaracy, many of the ""liberties"" taken in this movie may bother you. Like with many historical dramas, ages and events are not aligned with when they happened in real life. For those who are watching for more than mere entertainment purposes, this movie may not live up to your standards."
4,A Worthy Sequel For a Queen,"Others have covered the details sufficiently, so I will stick to a simple review. This sequel was one of those rare films that was as good as the original in every aspect. When a sequel is this good, it doesn't have to rehash the first film, it can just get on with the story telling. Fine work, a worthy watch, enjoy!"
2,Could watch it,"We never were able to finish the movie because the kept stopping to ""download"" and would get stuck. What we saw of it we liked."
1,Elizabeth: The Golden Age,Movie edited down way too much. It skipped a lot of important scenes which were in the original. I would not recommend it.
3,It's okay.,"They wan me to say more than,""it's okay"" but I am at a loss to add more. Maybe the acting was a bit overdone."
1,Completely Inaccurate. More Hollywood than History,"This was awful! The only redeeming value to this mess was the visuals. The costumes and sets look nice, but that's it! This movie was COMPLETELY inaccurate! It completely cuts Robert Dudley out of the story, even though he didn't die until after the battle with the armada. Where was Francis Drake? He harried the Spaniards more than Raleigh ever did and he's missing from the story as well (he also circumnavigated the globe, which made him a national hero). And the Spaniards weren't intercepting Mary Queen of Scots letters at all, Walsingham was too clever for that. Is it so much to ask that movies like this acutaully have some semblence of truth to them?"
3,Historic Thriller,"Set in 1585 when Spain is at war with England, suffering their worst military defeat in its history. Stars Cate Blanchette when Queen Elizabeth's reign is threatened, they must save their people. She makes a sacrifice for her country. Elizabeth was 1533-1602. Queen Elizabeth's reign is threatened in this historical drama,. Spain is defeated by England,"
3,For Elizabeth I fans...,"Good, but by no means as good as the first one. Cate Blanchett is, as always, exquisite, but the story line did not go deep enough. They glossed over some major pieces of history."
2,Re-hash of the first movie,"I had hoped for much better in this. The plot and the conflicts all seemed to be familiar; EtGA is little more than a re-hash of the first movie. (I won't even get into issues of historical accuracy--I don't think anyone expected much in that regard). Very tiresome.Plus, seeing the Queen of England riding around the battlefield in plate armor like some kind of Joan of Arc was just a little too much to swollow...Not recommended."
5,Wonderful,"We watch everything about the golden years, Henry the 8th, absolutely anything from those times. This was a beautifully made movie of the time.Costumes were authentic looking, and the acting was Great. If you enjoy this genre it's a must see."
4,"This is a sequel, be sure to watch the first film first","A different story than the first film, but it still has complexity and delightful talent. I think it might be good to take a refresher view of the first film before watching this one."
1,Rubbish!,"This dreadful movie takes extraordinary artistic license with the facts of history to be polite. The Spanish Ambassador looked more like an Arab than a real Spaniard and the portrayal of King Philip was akin to an evil and ugly scheming Klingon captain of Star Trek fame. In actuality, Elizabeth I was not all she was cracked up to by the propagandistic British historical establishment. That mad woman embroiled England in a war(1585-1604) against Spain that actually bankrupted it and forced her successor, King James I, to sue for peace with Spain and sign a peace treaty that was largely on Spanish terms."
1,Horrid,"In retrospect, the only good things about this film were a) we saw it in a spanking new theater, b) aside from me and my wife, there was only an elderly couple in the 100+ seat theater, which allowed me to fart freely, without distracting sneers from those I might offend with bowel scents, and c) it was stadium seating, which meant I could rest my feet up. Other than that, this film was the Al Pacino Scarface, sans drugs and bad Cuban accents but plus gaudy costumes: i.e.- bad, but highly mockable. Can I recommend such a melodrama? I don't know, I really don't- unless shadow puppeteering is your bag. Move over, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, here comes Lousy Liz and the Spanish Armada!"
2,Why did they bother except possibly for a costuming award?,"Oh, the costumes look fabulous. Ditto the set design and locations. But come on...Elizabeth comes off as shrill, petty, obsessive, and hysterical here, while Walsingham pops up now and then as a prop. Sir Walter Raleigh is somewhat interesting, as is the queen's favorite lady, Bess--but the story isn't supposed to be about them, is it?It's also incredibly irritating to watch scene after scene of actors being filmed through frosted glass. Apparently the director and cinematographer couldn't think of anything else to do.The whole film comes off as surprisingly dull, given the potential strength of the subject matter. Too bad."
2,a sad state of affairs,"Although I absolutely love the first film and recognize that this movie is not supposed to be a duplication of that....it is without a doubt a grade z fluff piece. What disappointed me the most was that Cate Blanchett signed on to make this movie. Sure...its pretty to look at but I really felt it was thin on plot, thin on dialogue, and thin on history. I can think of lots of movies with well lit shots and introspectve looks on actors' faces."
2,not a big fan,I understand the need to add a bit of drama to historical movies to make it more consumer friendly. But if you are going to stray that far away from fact you should just change the names and create a fictional character. Queen Elizabeth was an amazing ruler and person. She had plenty of drama and intrigue in her real life that I don't see the need to fabricate or diminish her person. Same feelings for the first movie they made.
1,Ideas No Story,"I love Elizabeth the movie and the blu ray is absolutely gorgeous to watch. I didn't see the Golden Age until I recently bought the blu ray. The movie is really bad. I was surprised at how little story there was. It plays like a beautifully photographed music video with no music.You see a lot of people hating Elizabeth with little or no explanation as to why other than the over used bastard, whore, heretic reasons/descriptions. Caricatures is a word to sum up all of the performances. The Golden Age is a woefully poor sequel to a movie that was sheer pageantry. Cate Blanchett in one of the featurettes said that she felt that she had gotten it all wrong. I don't think that she should feel bad about this because they ALL got it wrong - especially the writers.Beautiful but not worth buying."
3,A Bit of a Letdown...,"Alas, this sequel to 1998's 'Elizabeth' does not match the dramatic heights of its predecessor. While it certainly looks marvelous - the sets, costumes, and cinematography are fine indeed - nothing can make up for a script that lacks real dramatic spark and that too often sidelines its title character. A note to the producers, the director, and to screenwriter Michael Hirst: if you've managed to get Cate Blanchett back in the game as Elizabeth, you'd darn well better make sure that you use her. And when she is on stage, don't reduce Elizabeth's character to that of an insipid, love struck fool. *Sigh.* Any movie that manages to make both the Spanish Armada and Elizabeth Tudor dull (and that defangs Clive Owen to boot) is doing something wrong."
5,Good Film,"I'm not a big fan of this type of film, but the rest of my family likes them, and they though this was a good production. Good cast, good acting, nice sets - the whole package."
3,Beautiful to look at,"and not much else...not as good as the original ""Elizabeth"", but if you are a Elizabethan-phile (?) like me, you will enjoy yourself"
3,"Sumptous sets and costumes, a marvoulus Elizabeth but nothing more....","A feast for the eyes- sets, costumes the splendour. Cate Balanchett gives a super performance but..and there is no Gold in the Golden Age.... a banquet of sights which whimpers out at the end...despite some phyrotechics of the sea battle with the Spanish Armada at the end thrown in to liven things up....alas it fails to deliver satisfaction....there was no real story to tell....."
2,Looks like 'the Tudors' HBO/BBC series,This is a glossy sham - little historical accuracy or plot - all the focus is on a unsubstanciated romance between Queen Elizabeth & Walter Raleigh .Why couldn't we see more about the Armada itself & what happened to Spain & Britain as a result . This was pivotal to both nations & indeed the future establishment of the US as an english speaking colony not a spanish or french or dutch colony . England bacame THE world seapower after this & spain fell in to long term decline - Spain's empire included most of Europe plus most of South & Central America .Go on somebody - make us a real film about the Armanda plus Walter's adventures in Virginia etc .
1,Do not buy this film unless?,"This movie may rival Ishtar and March or Die as among the worst movies of all time. You will not see much in the movie unless you collect Elizabethan movies or unless you have a part of your portfolio dedicated to the worst movies. This makes The Tudors seem like Shakespeare.The Golden Age is poorly written, badly acted and predictable. It does not deserve to be equated to March or Die. It is as inane as Ishtar. Blanchett, Rush, etc. play the same predictable roles as in any piece of this genre. It is hackneyed and trite.I am a history moviefile. I love every movie of this genre, but this is often unwatchable. It is formulaic. It would be a waste of time except it is a beautiful film in terms of cinema and costume. Maybe it would be better as a silent film or if watched in a foreign language."
3,ok,"I liked the Armada scene, but the story doesn't run true to actual events throughout the movie. They picture Walter Reighly(spelling?) as a pirate! He was not a pirate, Walter Drake was the pirate that helped Elizabeth with the Armada. All of the actors are good though."
3,Bought for ex gf,"This movie is decent, I wouldn't know, more for the ladies. Men like movies with fart jokes and people like the American pie cast and Kumar!"
3,Elizabeth-the Golden Age?,"I looked forward to seeing this sequel to the 1998 release but somehow despite the great production values and Cate Blanchett's great performance in the lead role, I was disappointed. Most of the problem concerns the script which seems to lack focus. First we are treated to Elizabeth's problems with Mary Stuart, then her relationshop with Walter Raleigh (an excellent Clive Owen) and then the struggle with Prince Phillip of Spain to maintain diplomacy which culminates in war. In comparison to the original, there was a distinct point of view but in this sequel, everything is scattered with a lack of focus. The 3 stars I give this to are the superb HD DVD transfer, Blanchette's performance and of course the battle scenes. This is disc you would need to show off the virtues of HI-DEF!! If you like this type of history, do check it out but there are better films on this subject such as ""Elizabeth and Essex"" and ""The Virgin Queen""."
3,Not as good as the first,"I was disappointed with this movie. The first one, Elizabeth, was so much better. This was drawn out and really didn't go into all the events of the golden age. If my memory serves me right the daughter of the Spanish king, Philip, was not that young and the war scene did not occur as depicted in history. Even if the facts were not correct, it was not that entertaining."
2,The Sound and the Fury,"There's very little substance of any kind here. You do get lots of beautiful costumes, sets, some decent naval scenes, and endless posing. Cate and Clive both look marvelous, simply marvelous. Cate certainly belts her lines out with conviction and Clive does a very reasonable Errol Flynn. But there's no center to this film, no evidence that any thought went into it at all. To borrow a bit more from the Bard himself, while there's lots of sound and fury, it signifies nothing."
2,An inferior sequel,"Conflict between Protestants and Catholics flares as Philip II (Jordi Molla) of Spain plots the assassination of Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett) and the invasion of England. Meanwhile, on the home front, a romantic triangle heats up between Elizabeth, her favorite handmaiden Bess (Abbie Cornish), and Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen).No doubt the first Elizabeth film took its share of liberties with historical fact, but at least it was a serious examination of how a powerful and resourceful woman came to power, maintained her position, and the price she paid for it. This sequel is a combination of soap opera and Errol Flynn-type swashbuckler, peopled by one-dimensional characters."
3,Please do not watch this for a history lesson,"While this film is beautifully acted and a stunning visual treat it is not accurate by any stretch of the imagination. This movie should be enjoyed and looked at as an example of the myth surrounding Elizabeth but it is not a history lesson. If you really want to know more about the real Elizabeth please read books by Carole Levin, Susan Doran, or even an older scholar, Alison Plowden but please, enjoy the movie as just a movie."
5,Wonderful addition,For those of you who have purchased Elizabeth starring Cate Blanchett this will be a wonderful addition to your library. Many new faces and Clive Owen does a fantastic job as Sir Walter Raleigh. A must-own for any Anglofile.
5,Great movie but download did not finish.,The download to my Tivo series 2 stopped 15 minutes before the end of the movie and never finished. Sigh..... Now I have to go rent the movie to see the ending. Bad start for a service. Great movie! Actors are incredible. Scenery is awesome.
3,Almost as good as the first,"Elizabeth - The Golden Age is in my opinion, almost as good as the first. Instead of picking up closer to where the first had ended, this begins much later and several characters present in the first are not mentioned in this one. However, Cate Blanchet continues to embody the powerful part of Queen Elizabeth I. The movie ran on with scenes that had no build up of how they came to be. The plot to assasinate was almost a duplicate as in the first movie. I would have like to have seen more of the person and less of the plotting.Overall, it's worth watching."
2,I WAS DISSAPOINTED A LITTLE,"i loved the first but i feel the second comes up a little short, great if you catch it on HBO, but i wouldn't buy it again."
2,"Songs are great, but the funky remixes just suck","I have this CD and I love all the songs in it, but the people who produced the mixes butchered many of the songs by adding a bunch of ridiculous techno effects. Having grown in Colombia listening to Diomedez, I couldn't help but cringe upon hearing what was done to some of the songs.I would pay good money for a CD with the ORIGINAL versions of all these songs."
1,Fans Beware!,"2 complaints: first, this thing comes in one of those plastic cases that are nearly impossible to open without cutting yourself...only to find out when you DO open it, you've cut through the instructions book.Second, it lists many brands that it supports on the back of the package (in our case CyberHome) that are really NOT supported (upon looking through our newly taped together instructions manual, CyberHome is not listed where they give the codes)! So then we used their alternate method for finding codes not listed. Didnt work. So dont trust their claims that this thing has a huge code library. Obviously it doesnt, and obviously they have no problem with false advertising...who knows what else they claim this thing will do, but it doesnt? So dont let your team spirit get in the way of a getting something that actually will work for you!"
5,THIS MUSIC IS GOOD,"I AM THE FIRST ONE TO GIVE THIS ALBUM A REVIEW BUT I WILL NOT DO SO. ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT AGORIA IS THAT HIS SKILLS ARE ENDLESS AND THIS MUSIC WILL CHANGE YOU.FOR ALL OF YOU A LITTLE OUT OF DATE, AGORIA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE TRULY LEADING NAMES IN ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC, ESPECCIALY THE UNDERGROUND PART OF IT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. SOME OF HIS VERY SUCESSFULL PIECES ARE INCLUDED HERE: KOFEA, HAIKU, LA ONZIEME MARCHE... GET YOURSELF A CLUB AND TURN UP THE VOLUME."
1,A high school text book,"This 'text' is a horrible assessment of animal behavior. It attempts to cover all aspects of the subject matter, but contridicts itself throughout. This is truly a first edition. The author, editor, and publisher must have been in a rush to produce this. It reads as a high school text book in that it touches upon a bunch of subjects and studies, but never explains them. This is an amateur attempt at describing animal behavior, not to mention that this book is extremely overpriced. Don't waste your time or money on this worthless publication."
1,Not a college level book,"This book is definitively not suitable for a college-level class. I used it as a pre-oredered book in an Animal Behavior class, and I was embarrased to have assigned it to students. THe last few chapters were OK, but it does not provide any data description, covers evolution so superficially that it is fair to say it does not cover it at all, provides almost no in-depth study reviews... Maybe a high school (even middle school) text, but not for college students."
3,It Stains the Hands,This was okay but I had to take a wet cloth with me when I used it to wipe my hands down. It stained my hands.
4,"Well written, and very interesting.",A great book for anyone interested in weather. It is well written and very easy to understand. I recieved it as a gift for my interest in weather and plan to never get rid of it. It is well worth every penny!
5,compelling read,"This book grabs you from the first word and doesn't let go! Weather has never been more exciting! No matter who you are, layman or climatologist, this is reading entertainment."
4,Great for beginners!,"Lyon's books presents readers with a simple, readable format with comprehensive and concise answers to every type of weather-related question available. Great for the beginner weather [person]. The more experienced weather watcher may want to find a more detailed explaination for some answers, though. Lyon's section on sprites is a great plus as it contains much information which is not surprising as he is an expert on sprites. Recommended."
5,"Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL","This is a wonderful book which is full of fun facts and information about the weather. It is easy to read and very well organized. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL"
4,Good book,Good book on the church father Nazianzus. Talks about the Trinity and gives a understanding of the early churches discussions on Christology.
5,"Wonderful book, Teachers can use it for science!!!","This book is a great motivational book for science class. After reading about the gooey sticky oobleck, take corn starch, water and food coloring to make your own oobleck. It looks like a liquad, but feels like a liquad and a solid! The kids love it"
1,Book Fell Apart!!!,"Ok, I understand used but I took this book out of the package and the binding was OFF of the book! There were water stains and if the book binding is not in tact, what good is it? I cant believe I paid $10 for this. Im so very disappointed."
2,Stephen King for children,"Who can forget the horrifying image of King Derwin, up to his neck in oobleck, unable to move, waiting to be buried alive? Or of ordinary people suddenly attached to their household objects? Even a child can appreciate the life-threatening nature of a permanently adhesive substance falling from the sky in volume, and the terrible deaths which would result. Let's see this one become a live-action film."
5,Revival of 1949 classic,"It is interesting to see an early Dr. Seuss book.In black & white, it has been enjoyable to also use it as sort of a coloring book to add more oolor."
4,Caveat Emptor,"Used this in the past, and may again in the near future. One caveat, though. Spring for an attorney to review it before use, so it doesn't come back and bite you."
2,Topics categorized improperly cannot be changed,"Pro: I liked the inclusiveness of topics. Con: I hated the fact that I cannot easily move a topic to a different section. For example, I would have liked to put the topic ""Personal Appearance"" under ""Employee Conduct"" instead of ""Disciplinary Action."" I cannot fool the system into letting me do that. For people who just want to print out a generic HR manual, this is a good product. Any attempt to customize a handbook for your employees is much, much harder than doing it in MS Word. In fact, I am reduced to exporting the policies (thank goodness for Export) and formatting it in a different program because it is sooo much faster. I get mad every time I have to do that, though, and it defeats the purpose of having a safety system that protects your policies."
3,it's growing on me,"I got my package 2day. As soon as I open it, I inspect it. To my slight disappoint I find that the back of the hat has those lil adjustible plug-in's like a baseball cap. Im thinking that (prior to receiving my package)it was a slip on type of hat, clearly it isnt. However, this hat is growing on me. As I write my review im wearing it, lol. It's a cool hat very different from my typical truckers that I wear often. It kinda takes me back to my decade, the 80's. We wore hats like these alot."
5,Very happy.,I was very happy with this vendor. My book came in a reasonable amount of time and was in perfect condition. Thank you!
5,Bible Study Understanding the Scriptures,"I strongly recommend this book for anyone who wants to teach a bible study, or for personal enrichment. The material is arranged for easy use with a Bible, and the study guides are excellent. Having been a catechist for several years I have always been looking for excellent reference materials. The course is complete and has wonderful references. The additional readings include many well written books on sacred scripturesand thought provoking questions for students of young adult and adult ages.Add this one to your personal libary and enjoy for years to come."
5,Wonderful; Beautifully Illustrated,"This beautiful book is a must for every Catholic family. I know that it will be an important part of my family's homeschooling.I won't detail the contents, since other reviewers will likely do so.With so many Catholics realizing how little they know about their own faith, this book couldn't have come at a better time. The information is quite easy to read and is very accessible. For homeschooling (or adult renewal) the charts and graphs are extremely useful especially for those who have trouble connecting the scriptural dots.Thank you, Scott Hahn. Keep 'em coming."
4,"good sound, 4th gen iPod Nano works but there's no docking spacer that fits exact","sound is rather good, 4 stars seems appropriate.it's just that out of the 9 iPod docking spacers, none fit the 4th generation iPod nano."
4,Works just fine,"Works great. Very light, only uses 4 AA batteries, comes with a remote, sounds great. The nano docking plate was sized correctly, but didn't align the connector on the ipod over the speaker connector correctly. Some JB weld and a dremel tool fixed it just fine. There are so many versions of the nano that having a nano plate that doesn't match isn't uncommon, so I wasn't surprised.I bought this for use in my RV."
1,don't waste your money,"I've gone through several iterations of rechargeable batteries and chargers but never had a problem. I have 2 chargers that still work but the batteries aren't easily obtainable.This piece of junk worked fine twice: with the first set of 4 batteries and the 2nd set. The charge in my camera with 4 batteries was sufficiently long. So long that when I needed to recharge them again I popped 'em into the charger, plugged it in (making a mental note the charge light didn't go on), and took them out the next day to discover they were still dead. Some device in the house is still using one AA battery because I can find only 3 of the 2nd set.I tried different outlets and power cords and jiggled the stupid electrical prongs about (which look like a zillion other fold-out prongs) but the charge light never came on and the batteries don't charge no matter how long they're left in.Now I have to find another nickel metal hydride charger -- anyone got any suggestions?"
4,Very Good Charger for Casual Use,"When I first received this charger, I was at a loss as it comes with no instructions. However, after a brief trip to the energizer website, I found what I needed. This charger is an 8 hour charger. This means it's best for those who have lots of NiMH batteries and sequentially charge, or those who use digital cameras or other high-drain devices only casually. I'm one of the latter.This charger can handle 4 AA or 4 AAA batteries and has an internal timer, so it shuts off when charging is complete. It's also light-weight and compacts to pocket-size for persons who need to minimize space use, or who need to use it while travelling. I travel quite a bit, taking photos with a Canon Powershot A80 (4x AA batteries) it's been with me on every tripMy only complaint is the time taken to charge, but as a casual user, that problem is solved by getting more NiMH batteries so you always have charged backups. In my opinion, a great buy."
1,Engergizer Overnight Bombs on Power Surge,"Aside from some of the operational difficulties other purchasers experienced, I would add that this little puppy can't handle power fluctuations. We had it on during a slight ""dip"" in our electric to thehouse (the kind where the lights dim for about 2 seconds) and blotto, this guy died."
1,Awful product,"I've been a huge fan of rechargable batteries for the last 10 years or so for daily use in items such as discmans, cameras and wireless controllers.That said, I've been through a few different brands with no complaints-- until now. The Energizer compact charger is just a poorly designed and manufactured product. I would know-- I bought two of them thinking the first one was just faulty.The main problem with the charger is that it only sporadically provides an adequate connection to charge the batteries. It works about 50% of the time with the AA's, but I've yet to ever get the AAA dock to successfully charge a battery with either of the two Energizer chargers I bought. I've never had this problem with any of the other chargers I've had in the past, and it's extremely annoying to pop a freshly charged set of batteries into your items only to realize they hadn't been charged.Avoid this charger."
2,Why this battery charger is so cheap,"Sold at Sams with 8 AA and 4 AAA batterys. The clue about how this charger works is in the instruction sheet: ""Note: If the unit is unplugged or power is interruped during the charging cycle, the time will start over and run the full charge cycle."" and ""The charger is designed to charge AA NiMH batteries (maximum capacity of 2500 mAh) and AAA NiMH batteries (maximum capacity of 850 mAh) For lower rated capacity batteries simply remove the batteries before the charge cycle is complete based on the following charge time."" (table of approriate charge times is listed)In other words this charger doesn't sense overcharge because it only has a timer. After 8.5 hours the charger turns off. Period, end of details. Why do you think this Energizer battery charger is so cheap? Now you know."
3,No picture of product can be a problem...,"A word to the wise: be careful of choosing from among many similar products without a definitive photograph to help you make sure you know what you're getting. I relied on the ""product manual"" in PDF format linked on the page, only to discover that the image therein (and likely the rest of the information it contained) didn't match what was being sold on this page! I received a completely different charger that had the capacity to charge only one 9-volt battery at a time, rather than the two I had seen in the manual. While I'm sure this is a decent charger (at half the cost compared to even the warehouse clubs), it isn't what I need. Bottom line: be careful when ordering without photographs!"
1,This destroyed 20+ of my batteries,"I like the physical design of this product, which is why I bought it. The problem is it is not a smart charger - it will charge your batteries for a preset time even if they don't need it, which damages the batteries. After a few months of that, now my batteries all have 10% of the life they used to. I didn't understand the problem until doing a lot of research on it. I think Energizer should be sued for selling this thing without a warning."
1,Energizer piece of JUNK!!!!,This product worked about 3 weeks. Green lite quit functioning almost immediately and sometimes the batteries never get charged or else charger not working at all anymore.Don't waste your money on this one!!!! Spend a little more and try Duracell or another brand.
1,Bogus Pic & Description,"Order this only to discover that the image and description didn't match what was being sold on this page! I received a completely different charger that had the capacity to charge only one 9-volt battery at a time, rather than the two I had wanted. I'm sure this is a decent charger But not for my use right now. Very Disappointed in Target!!!"
3,Earnest but depressing view of early Italian labor unrest,"Mastroianni gives a muted performance as he moves from town to town organizing the masses into unions. Overlong and depressing. Uninvolving. The sort of film that used to give ""foreign films"" a bad name. Oscar Nom for Original Story."
3,"Wonderful, fascinating book, but poorly translated and edited","This is an amazing book by Imam Ali, cousin/son-in-law of the Prophet of Islam, Mohammed. It is full of prayers, stories, advice, that are applicable to everyone. So much of it is simply beautiful. Unfortunately, this translation is poorly edited and translated. Typos abound. There is no parallel Arabic text. Texts begin and end with no clear breaks. It's often difficult to tell where the translation of Imam Ali's words ends and the commentary begins. Unfortunately, I am unaware of any better translation."
1,"A review not of the book , but of the editor of the book","A word of caution , small people appropriate the words of great people according to their own capacities of understanding and concern.Hadrat Ali (RA) is loved and honoured by muslims and non muslims alike , and his talks & letters contain so many jewels and doors of spirituality that no one can afford to reduce them to a purely political, historical or social level, which is unfortunately exactly what the publishers of this edition have done.Each talk is followed by an Shia diatribe aimed only at propogating their own limited ideology rather than at elevating the readers spiritual level & closeness to God."
2,What a dud!,"This is NOT a book. It is a booklet with 20 pages TOTAL! It does not even have a table of contents it is so small. I have most of Nee's books, but I would not recommend this one. It is not worth the $3.00 postage. All of its contents, which is little, should have been included in some other book rather than offered as a ""book."" I was very disappointed. In fact, this is my only disappointment with the publisher of Nee's works."
1,garbage,"this might be the worst cd i have ever heard. there is only 1 good song on here, snitch. the rest of this album is so bad its rediculis. dont buy this"
4,Better than first album?,"Obie Trice seems comfortable, and lyrics flow better than first album. Album sounds lower budget than Cheers, but the rest makes up! I still say Cheers is better. If you like Obie Trice you'll like this CD it's not as disappointing as other reviews claim!"
5,"Best Rap Album of 2006, so far","This album is serious. Very honest lyrics.. great production.. Obie lyricism on this album is second to none. Certain verses are ran from start to finish, with same rhyme pattern, real Eminemesque, but in Obie's own style. I'd highly recommend this album to any and everyone..."
4,Rippin any Instruments he's given!!!,"I really enjoyed this LP, I agree with a lot of reviewers saying that this has a darker feel than the 1st one, making it better in comparison to the 1st. The only reason why I'm givin it 4 stars is because I like O when he made Well Known @sshole, Mr Trice, Gimme my Dat back, Broke, Jobs, Homeless etc. I wanna hear THAT hungry MC again. I'm not takin anything away from this release its really good. To sum it up, its what you can expect from him after makin those classics."
3,Second Rounds on Me,"I heard this album about 3 weeks before it was released. Obies Sales have been poor...i wonder why? When Encore leaked to the internet aftermath did all they could to release Em's album one week later. Why diddnt they do this with obie? Now his sales are suffering DRAMTAICALLY! And it really is a shame. Because this is truly a good album. Obie has stepped up his lyrical game and really showed who he is as an artist. Eminem did his thing with most of the production. Some of the highlight of this album were, ""Wake Up"" , ""Violent"", ""24's"", ""There they Go w/Big Herk and Eminem"", ""Everywhere I Got Ft 50 cent"" and ""Obie Story"".But songs like ""Since they Wanna Know"" and ""Mamma"" Just werent hittin to me. They diddnt seem to match the dark tone that this album gave off. I really think it's a shame obie isnt selling like he should because he proved on this album that he has the potential to be a big voice in the game."
4,Not a bad sophomore effort,"This album is full of decent rhymes over decent beats. Its not a hip hop classic but it should not be overlooked like I'm sure it will. Alot of Obie's songs sound the same to me, maybe its his rapping style or maybe its em producing half his tracks, but it's still a decent album worth buying. Cry Now, Violent, Snitch (Akon can make anything a hit in my book), and Out of State. Towards the end of the cd you can skip around but don't skip the last song, Obie's Story, its hot. Nice disc Obie, too bad it got bootlegged a month ago and every one has it played out by now."
5,Another Obie Trice hit: Second Round's On Me,"Obie Trice did well with this album. I think it's just as good as the Cheers album. Obie raps about his life and how he grew up and he keeps it real with songs like ""Snitch"" feat. Akon and ""Ballad of Obie Trice"" and ""Cry Now"". I also like the songs ""Kill Me A Mutha"", ""Everywhere I Go"" (which 50 Cent delivers a good chorus), ""Jamaican Girl"" feat. Brick & Lace, ""There They Go"" feat. Big Herk, Eminem & Trick Trick, ""All Of My Life"" feat. Nate Dogg, ""Lay Down"", ""Ghetto"" feat. Trey Songz (who's featured on another song too) and one of Obie's greats ""Obie Story"". The other songs are good as well. The beats on alot of the songs are good too. Obie Trice is another hiphop artist who's real with his raps. Good album."
2,great if you want to sleep all day,I was very frustrated because it seemed like a promising product. But what dingbat would put valerian root in this? It put me to sleep. Get rid of the valerian root!!
3,Up for review,Have only tried product for short time. Has very strange after taste like garlic. Do not know if truly working as my last bp was 160/110
2,Not Effective,"I used it for two weeks and my blood pressure went up!However,I can't blame this OTC product because Rx medications haven't done so well either.In general,I've found Futurebiotics products to be good and effective."
2,What this is,"Just a quick followup to earlier reviews. The matches listed earlier are from the ""Best of Starrcade 1983-1987"" 2 tape set that was put out in the 80s. At least that is what I think the other person was alluding to. That's very different than the WCW ""best of"" series in the late 90s which were a bunch of quick highlight tapes at low prices. I don't know why people buy those little 30-60 minute comps, but they aren't very expensive, so if you want a quick trip down memory lane for a low price, it's not that bad. BTW, the Best of Starrcade 83-87 is quite hard to find, and would probably set you back closer to $$$$$ for an original copy. It is the only way to see in top quality some of the very early Starrcade matches."
1,Don't be Fooled by Previous Reviews,"My Family ordered this tape 3 days ago. The review shown from the unknown parts reviewer listed many matches. These matches are NOT on the video. Matches that are on video are all highlights (hence best of). The total running time of tape is only 60 minutes. Most matches involve Ric Flair (Flair-Race, Flair-Sting, other stars-Piper, Valentine, Rhodes, Blanchard, Magnum TA, Road Warriors)The Briscoes, Steamboat and Youngblood, Midnight Express, Rock N Roll Express etc. are NOWHERE to be seen. The more info. on product failed to provide running time, list of stars included,or specify that matches are HIGHLIGHTS. The cover also does not list stars (only running time). Relying on reviewer's comments led to big disappointment. My advice-keep looking."
3,WHAT A UNBELIEVABLE SCREW JOB,"I was expecting StarrCade 1983 (Harley Race vs. Ric Flair) to, at the least, StarrCade 1997 (Sting vs. Hulk Hogan). Instead, what we got was an excellent video about StarrCade 1983 to StarrCade 1990. It was a good video, but I still felt ripped off. The video cover is very deceiving by having Kevin Nash and Bill Goldberg on the cover of the video, two men who did not even work for the company from 1983 to 1990. All in all, good video, but it should have contained the ENTIRE history of the NWA/WCW StarrCade."
3,Humorless,"This is a book of contrasts. On the one hand, it is not your stereotypical story of a foreigner lost in Japan. The primary character, Alec, does speak Japanese and we get a sight (or perhaps a glimpse) of the world away from Roppongi and Nishi-Azabu. Apart from a few quasi-errors, I thought that descriptions of time spent away from the hackneyed gaijin hang-outs was the best part of the narrative.At the same time Alec remains rather detached from (and ungrateful towards) many of the people around him, preferring to take advantage of beautiful down-on-their-luck women and be pandered to by mother-substitutes. As a result, he is probably not the most sympathetic of main heroes. The family break-up sub-plot was rather limp but realistic enough.However the biggest failing in the novel is the almost total absence of humour. And Japan without a sense of humour is about as much fun as the drive from Narita to Central Tokyo."
1,Too foolish,"Going to Japan and spending long enough there to really absorb the language and culture was a dream of mine from my youngest days. That dream never got fulfilled, so I got this book to see what another young Yank's experience might have been like. Too bad the main character is an entitled, oblivious, morose fool. The story is a collection of various unfortunate and highly improbable social blunders, interspersed with irrelevant memories of his miserable childhood. I skipped forward, almost to the end, hoping to get to a part where he might experience some kind of epiphany or at least learn something. No such luck -- I will not be able to finish this book."
3,Reservation Road is a better Johnathan B Schwartz book.,"Not too bad, from a descriptive standpoint. Schwartz is very familiar with Japanese tradition and customs and introduces his readers to these concepts freely. He does a wonderful job relaying the scenes about Japan as well, from the urban chaos to to serene outskirts. Where Schwartz seems to struggle is in the character development of Alec and the supporting cast. Too many of the plot devices used to move the story along seem contrived, seemingly there to 'force' a character to react to his or her surroundings. There is an almost 'unnatural' appearance to the way the characters respond to their situations, almost rushed and forced at times. Schwartz' work in Reservation Road is significantly stronger -- take a look if you get a chance."
2,Self-conscious writing,"While the descriptions of Toyko are fluid and pictorial, scenes where the protagonist interacts with other characters seems very unnatural and forced. It reminded me of watching a movie or play, where you see an actor *acting*, rather than seeing a *character*. In the case of Bicycle Days, I couldn't get pass that fact that the writer was *writing* so I never really saw Alec as a real character. In addition, the flashback scenes didn't grasp my interest as anything unique or intriguing, although I imagine they are important to understand. I'll never know, since I put the book down after reading 75 pages."
1,"Boring, nonsensical, garbage.","Nothing special. It's no different from the billions of other start-up books, too general to be of any use to someone seriously considering starting their own business.This book might be an excellent primer for starting your own lemonade stand, but your own business? You're better off doing it blind."
2,I dont own this single but...,"...I have heard the songs on it. All three of them. Heres what I have got to say about them.1.Unstable - Okay at the best. I am not too impressed of it, and I wouldent mind if I never heard it again. Its not the most original song ever, either.2.Immortal - I first heard this song on the Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance videogame for Xbox. Its decent, but really, I wouldent care if I never heard it again. Thats not a very good thing.3.Giving In - The best song here. I dont love it, but I think its alright. I wouldent mind hearing it again, but I wouldent buy an Adema cd over it."
3,Octane,"This movie was good just like car racing, and the drama could have gone better with the title. You just to see if for yourself."
1,Tripe,"For those interested in the sorcery of medieval Europe, this book may look interesting - don't be fooled. It is a farrago of half-understood and often misrepresented material, lifted from both actual grimoires, and from the anti-magical works of the church. The author pretends that there are medieval 'black books' of diabolism - there are none. He presents material lifted from Gardnerian Witchcraft as part of 'satanic' ritual, and in general lies freely to his readers. Those interested in the real magic of the middle ages, including demon-summoning, will do much better to read Waite."
1,Tripe indeed,"The dust jacket advertises the book to be from documents in the British Library, but has no bibliography, no sources listed, and no footnotes. It appears to be a fabrication based somewhat on known medieval and later grimoires. It contains nothing of merit or interest to the serious researcher or student of magick. The binding is of a very poor quality, the pages look like photocopies, and the illustrations are very poorly rendered."
5,Lots of Patterns . . . Great for Creativity,"This book has some great stitches (I especially love the bobbles)! They range from relatively easy, to super complicated. Each stitch also has a picture next to it of what a completed swatch looks like, which is great for visual people like me! Another great thing is the grouping by number of rows in the pattern, which makes designing your own Aran creations easy. My biggest complaint: it's not spiral bound, so the pages start to come out after use."
2,Disappointing buy,"Purchased this book thinking it would be equal to or better than the Vogue Cable volume. What a disappointment. While the directions and pictures are clear, the stitches given lack energy and inspiration. The samples are all worked in the traditional Aran creamy color and that does not allow the work to really shine in photos. This volume is also a bit larger than expected so it will not tuck neatly into my knitting bag. I would only recommend this book for those just beginning to build their knitting library and that recommendation is based solely on price."
2,Disapointing.,"After waiting for 3 years to buy this book, I was very disappointed because there was really nothing special about the stitches it holds. Each of them are found in other Harmony books so they are only listed as Aran stitches, which they are, but they are duplicates, which makes the book unnecessary for a knitting library."
5,Thank the Force for Zahn!,"Star Wars writers like Zahn have the quality and the magic to bring the Star Wars galaxy back to life. His books and magnificent style of writing almost want to make you even forgive Kevin J. Anderson over his many mistake*. Well ... almost.*1. Destroying the character and integrity of Mara Jade by making her seem two-dimensional and making her have an intrest in Lando (YUUCK!). 2. Darksaber. The Imperial's are not that pathetic, and neither are the Hutts. And puh-lease, like Mara would pay attention to that selfish pig ... er, uh, Callista (she needs a reality check! Luke's too good for her if she can't recognize him as a man instead of some flimsy Force powers).3. By making the son of Han Solo, Jacen Solo, turn into an utter geek. And for the whole Junior Jedi Knights thing.Can't wait till Visions of the Future!!!"
2,"Been there, done that.","I notice that the previous customer reviews generally agree that ""Specter of the Past"" isn't as good as the original trilogy. In fact, it is practically a rewrite, minus the suspense. The original trilogy is held by many to be the high point of the Star Wars books, an opinion I don't share, though it certainly is better than most of them. Zahn manages to make Leia a little less dull than usual, but he is no good at all with Luke, and seems to know it, as Luke is a bit-player here. Zahn also brings a few more characters into play, which helps a bit. Mara Jade's popularity with the faithful is a baffler, because her character never develops beyond a lot of sarcasm. But the relevation of the plot from the first robs the book of even fake suspense. The only thing we don't know: when is Luke going to ever get laid?"
5,Bre's,"Firstly, I must say that Zahn is the best Wars writer out there. He's not flawless, of course, but he certainly displays greater skill in this difficult genre than anyone else. The fact that he is the author is a good recommendation for the Hand of Thrawn dualogy. Once again we have the high quality writing, the well-handled plot lines, and good characterisations. It's great to see Mara once again under the pen of her creator. No one else - except maybe Stackpole - can get her quite right. Even better was the handling of Luke's bad habit of using the Force too much, though this has been seen as a virtue by some writers eg Mr Anderson. All in all, a great book."
3,Can't he get any new ideas?,"It was an okay book, but like the other Zahn books, was very slow moving. And he had the EXACT same characters as the other trilogy. (Pellaeon, Thrawn, etc) I mean, come on!"
3,"Not much action, but sets up a good plot.","It was good, but not enough actual action. It did a good job of setting up a plotline for the next one in the series, but that is all. Especially the Bothans and Caamas thing. That has great potential. With the return of ""Thrawn"", it would be suspenseful, but you know what the other side is planning. I usually say if it would make a good movie or not. It would be ok, but not as good as any in the trilogy."
4,Zahn has done it again,Once again we are placed inside the Star Wars universe as if it truly exists.Zahn captures the essence os George Lucas's universe and adds depth in ways that astound readers everywhere.
3,Nothing ground breaking.,"I echo preceding comments about the book being slow to get going, and when it does, it seems to lose it's way a little and start meandering it's way through several chapters. It's a good book alright, but don't expect to be gripped."
4,Just Wait Till We Get The Sequel . . .,"A good read that left me in suspense at the end. This is only one third of the story, so I am really waiting for the sequel. Hopefully, Luke and Mara will get into a relationship there . . ."
5,WOW!,"Timothy Zahn is Great! This is the best book written for the Star Wars universe since The Last Command. I couldn't put this book down, and would read it late at night, even though I had to get up early in the morning. This book is a winner, and a must for all Star Wars Fans."
3,Not his best work,"This book was very slow and boring at times. However, it still had it's good points. Zahn really leaves you hanging by not resolving quite a few issues throughout the book. Vision of the Future should be much better reading."
4,"Best Read by Zahn Fans, Daunting for Newbies",I enjoyed the book but have to say that it's generally off limits for newcomers to the SW novels. Fans of Zahn will love this book especially since he discards the work of several other SW authors. Zahn either found their work cumbersome or delivered a big FU to other SW authors.Fans of Chewbacca and Threepio will be disappointed since they are an afterthought. Fans of Luke will be entertained by another romance but not enough force introspection.The second book is better than the first.
2,"A mediocre re-hash of the ""heir to the empire"" trilogy","This story is a complete waste of money. For a much better book, re-read ""Heir to the Empire"". The plot is a re-hash of Zahn's last trilogy and even has a cornball reincarnation of dead characters and a reused plot.It was nice to revisit some of the popular characters, but the story itself was impotent and dull."
4,Excellent follow up to his first Star Wars success,"This fisrt book in Zahn's new trilogy is a wonderful and exciting work of art. He brings back the old favorites of the Star Wars saga, at the same time bringing intriguing new characters that have just as much details as the old ones. He also throwns in new challenges for our cherished characters to handle. A good point of this is that he doesn't put his characters in a situation that you can guess how they suceed (i.e. Blow up a Death Star, Kill so and so, etc.) I do disagree with the Reader from Haiwaii. The whole book is there, it's supposed to feel like it is only a third completed, that is why it's called a trilogy. If you'll look carefully, the books are the same size as before."
2,A good Star Wars story but less than half a book,Could be a good book. But nothing is resolved. Everything is left hanging. The 2 book series will probably make one good book. It is a rip-off to have to buy 2 books to read one story. I don't remember this to be Zahn's style.
2,The Blah of Thrawn,"I put the book down about half-way through it because I just couldn't get into it anywhere near as much as the Thrawn Trilogy. I realize that this book is probably just a lot of setting-up for the 2nd book, but I decided that I'd rather read other books instead of be bored on the way. It probably would have been better if Zahn had stuck with his original idea of one book instead of making it a duology.Instead of this book, I highly recommend the following 5-star novels:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"
5,The Saga Continues with style,"At last a new star wars book, that justly deserves its place in the universe. Timothy Zahn has taken us back to the suspense and drama, he first displayed with the ""Heir to the Throne"" trilogy. I love the fact that the ""Tonnika twin story"" in Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina relates to this story and that one of my favourite characters is now a part of the usual group (Shada the mistral, of course).The plot and subplots are filled with political intrigue and plenty of action, unfortunatley luke is not a major player in this story, but encompassing this fact, two other players have larger roles (Mara Jade and Talon Karrde.)Could it be possible that these two could have their own adventures retold by Timothy Zahn. All in all I am gasping for the next episode....May the force be with you all"
5,Looks like another great series,Zahn is amazing. The guy looks like he's about to out do himself. He's already got the best star wars books out. Now he's writing better ones. If these books don't come out soon I'll explode with anticipation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Started out slow but gained speed.........,"is the way I would describe this novel. In fact, it seems to go fast, then slow, then fast, then slow, until about the last 100 or so pages, which just FLY BY! And the way he leaves you hanging going into the second half is masterful! Another Star Wars beauty by Zahn!"
2,boring,"the irritating writing style continues...unfortunately this time there is no attempt at a storyline and no interesting characters. we don't really need to be informed every time someone has to 'connect to the force', or runs through jedi meditation techniques, etc. it has to be implied at some point really."
4,read it,"What makes Timothy Zahn the best is that he keeps Star Wars what it should be: a conflict between good and evil portrayed by the alliance and the empire. The other authors just go off on science fiction tangents that are fun, but Zahn keeps true to Star Wars. He develops Pellaeon's character extremely well. It's fun, intelligent, and involving."
5,Some of Zahn's best work. It takes science-fiction sky high,"Specter of the Past is a beautifully written book that follows up on his previously written trilogy about Grand Admiral Thrawn. It all starts with Thrawn's reincarnation, while the New Republic slowly breaks up over an issue of Bothan betrayal. If you liked his first trilogy, you'll love this!"
1,Yawn...,"Zahn should leaving the Star Wars novels to Kevin J. Anderson. Never has it taken me so long to read a book. Zahn yammers on and on without saying much. Too many strange aliens which never appeared in the trilogy, and not enough of the main characters, espically Luke Skywalker. Too complicated, too many storylines, not enough action, and just plain uninteresting. One of the worst Star Wars novels to date."
1,This book sucks!,This book sucks. Too many stupid subplots that are not very interesting. There is nothing very captivating at all with the crises that Zahn presents. Nothing even happens in this book and you end this book feeling like he wrote one huge book andjust cut it in the middle and made them two books. The worst book I have ever read.
1,Truly a sad excuse.,"Timothy Zahn has taken it on himself to write the book(s) in which the Empire finally collapses and surrenders to the New Republic. The characters are great. The set-up is good. The final result is a cliffhanger. The second book, Vision of the Future, is an attempt to bring together everything that happened in all of the novels written to date. Considering what he had to work with, Zahn did a great job. Unfortunately, he included a lot of garbage (such as anything written by Kevin J Anderson) and completely destroyed his product. This is a must miss."
2,Merely a set-up for Vision of the Future,"This book goes way too slowly and is mostly a bore. However, you will not be able to understand the terrific Vision of the Future if you don't read it first."
5,Great continuation of Zahn's creation of his Star Wars World,"Thrawn, long thought and accepted to be dead has arisen or has he? In this new series Zahn reawakens the fear felt in the senators of the council with the reemergence of the greatest strategist of the Empire. This comes to light in the center of the dealing of an age-old crime committed by the Bothans long before the Alderaan incident. Divided the Alliance is in the grip of losing it all to the rag tag minions of the Empire."
4,Definitely Worth Reading,"This is a great book. I didn't feel it was as good as the Zahn's Trilogy, but still a good read. I loved the little Luke/Mara thing goin."
4,This makes me hungry for more!,Timothy Zahn is a good writer. He catches the reader's imagination from the beginning of the book. I liked the part where Thrawn's impersonator came under pressure when he had to answer Lando's questions. The plot of the book does not allow you to make easy predictions of what happens next. I can't wait to read Zahn's next book.
3,"Disappointing as a standalone, just the first act","The entire book is rising action (first act in dramatic terms), which makes it feel very slow and tedious. I haven't read Vision of the Future yet (just finished this one), but this entire book feels like it's just setting up for that. Unlike the 3 separate installments of the Thrawn Trilogy, which all work as independent books with their own conflicts being resolved (while also creating a full narrative over the three books), there's no resolution. It jumps back and forth between characters and plots, and 2/3 of the way through the book the reader still doesn't know where it's all leading. Bottom line: they should have released the 2 as one big book, but they probably wouldn't have made as much money or sold as many books. Zahn is one the best writers to handle the Star Wars universe, but I give it 3 stars due to publishing decisions."
3,"Well, it serves as a good transition novel","well its true what people say, there is very little action. its not even too exciting. and unlike the thrawn trilogy (heir to the empire, dark force rising, the last command) there is not much interaction between the characters we know and love. its the new characters who take center stage in this novel, and luke does pretty much nothing here. but, you have to read this book because it provides the background needed to understand Vision of the Future (which is wayyyy better) also it follows from the last command so make sure u read those three first. think of it this way, you dont want to miss Vision of the Future so you'll have to read this. and as long as u're a star wars fan, u wont mind so much. enjoy!"
2,Too little for too much,"I got the distinct feeling that this was half or even a third of a book, having much less content then a single book from Zahn's Star Wars trilogy. Theme after theme was introduced and then dropped, with none of the richness of his previous work. It felt tremendously unfinished and unsatisfying. I can't think of any reason to publish a book this way other then pure greed. Even when the second book is published, if it continues in this mold, I doubt if the two books together will equal one of the original Zahn Star Wars books."
4,A great book!,"This book is great, but the returning of Grand Admiral Thrawn is not very good. It would be more interesting if he was cloned or something. Remeber to read Vision of the future, too, the conclusion of this Hand of Thrawn Duology. I haven't read Timothy Zahn's first Thrawn Trilogy yet, but I am going to start on Heir To the Empire soon.All Star Wars fans MUST read this book!"
4,Way better then all the other writers together!,"I was so happy to hear that Zahn was writing another series of books for Star Wars. After some of the cheesy stuff that had been coming out lately, from the almost childish (The Crystal Star), to the ""Super Weapon of the week"" books (Darksaber, Jedi Academy, Children of the Jedi), it was nice to see a quality book again. And what the other writers did to Mara! They just destroyed her personality! Almost an insult to Zahn. Thank goodness we got away from that Lando and Mara mess! Timothy Zahn truly captures the spirit of the movies, the original charcters. Although I thought that Pelleaon should have had a more substantial role (I find him much more interesting then the Moff and his *crew*), and that it was a little slow to get going, it is still a great book, and way better then all the other Star Wars books, excepting the Heir to the Empire trilogy. Definatly a great book!"
5,I can't whate untill the next one!!!,Mara And Karrde are back! I love these two characters and no one has done anything with them. I hope the two of them get together in the next book. They are perfect for eachother I mean Lets face it There is no one elce who could handle Mara.
5,GREAT QUICK REFERENCE !!!,"As an RN, MSN in a busy pediatric office, this is the perfect book for quick reference for tons of info on almost all pediatric office topics. I use ours often and copy pages to use as handouts for parents who want to have something to refer to later at home. I love this book!"
1,Rip Off Alert,"Both this book, Summoned to Tourney, and the first in the series, Knight of Ghosts and Shadows are contained in one book, Bedlam's Bard. But they don't tell you that anywhere under this title, under Knight, or under Bedlam's Bard. I'm sure they would love it if we all bought all 3 books! But I really don't need two copies of any of them... It would be nice when they publish compilations if they told you the names of the books in the new one!"
5,Snap-in Mobile Rack is a Snap to Use!,"I was so impressed by this product that I ordered 3 more. Well constructed, easy to install and the ability to swap hard drives is great!"
5,Sata 3.5 Hard Drive Mobile Rack,"I've use mobile racks for ATA drives for many years, and, knew that they came in various levels of sturdiness and quality.Needing a SATA mobile rack, I purchased this one sight unseen.I was delighted on receipt as the drive rack was very well made, very easy to install.Unlike older mobile racks where you needed to have a separate internal carriage for each drive, this unit does not require an internal carriage for each hard drive that is being used.If you need a SATA mobile rack I recommend this one for both quality and value"
3,Great actors doing meaningless movie,"I love watching movies by Om Puri, Girish Karnard and Sharmila. I am giving three stars for those three stars."
5,My 2 year old's snugglie,My 2 year old became so attached to this toy that we are on our third one. He takes it to bed every night and carries it around all day. It takes alot of abuse.
4,&#65533;ABC&#65533; by Dr. Seuss,"""ABC"" by Dr. SeussThis book contains all the letters from the alphabet and a bunch of zany, nonsense words that have some great humor in reading them out loud to a group of kids, or just having your child(ren) reading them alone, or out loud to someone else around them. As the book progresses it has some weird phrases and word combinations, like ""Big Q, little q what begins with Q? The quick Queen of Quincy and her quacking quacker-oo."" This is a real nice beginner, and not intermediate but still a low reading level, book for kids who have trouble with their letters and words."
4,"Not a great early reader, but a fun readaloud for those learning the alphabet","You know the format of abecedarians. Each letter is illustrated with a rhyme - it might be a sentence describing the scene (Silly Sammy Slick sipped six sodas and got sick sick sick) or a list of various items in the picture that start with the letter (Big N, little n, what begins with those? Nine new neckties, and a nightshirt, and a nose).Very typically Seussian, really great read-aloud - neither too long nor too short.Please note that I do not recommend the board book. They arbitrarily edited some of the rhymes (never for the better), and anyway, it's poorly constructed and likely to fall apart. Just get the real book. You'll thank me later."
2,whoa...SLOW down!,"The music and reading is fun, but it is way too fast, my 3.5 year old twins can barely keep up...it doesn't give the child any time to look at the pages!"
5,Love this one!,"This is a fun way to get the ABCs, and it has helped my 2 year old. He tries to practice writing his ""big c, little c, big o, little o"" all the time now."
5,Essential ABC book!,This book is an EXCELLENT way to get your child interested in and learning about the alphabet. It's honestly the best alphabet book I've come across so far. The rhythm and rhyming will capture children's interest and you'll soon find that your child is able to recite the entire book! I love that it shows upper *and* lower case letters -- something that a lot of alphabet books lack. The illustrations are typical Dr. Seuss -- silly and whimsical and just perfect for kids.
3,slightly damaged,Dilivery time was longer then I would have expected.The left top corner and left bottom corner was damaged.But over all: One of my nieces favorite books!
2,Iffy Book,I felt that this book was too scuffed and corners were too banged up. I was not happy with my order.
2,Disappointing,"While the illustrations are cute, Dr. Suess's ABC's did not hold my 4-year-old's attention. I was disappointed that the book didn't use simpler language, so beginning readers could try sounding out some words on their own.Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My Baby"
5,Very good,"Easy to install, more info can be had on webb if u have a problem. I had an eight to nine pound trigger on a Remington R-15 it is now a bit over 3lbs. with very little creep."
2,"Great toy, poorly made","I really wanted a toy steering wheel that was an infant toy. Most seem to be steering wheels that play music and light up and have a lot of buttons. I was looking for a steering wheel that would encourage my kids to pretend to be driving, especially in the car.This toy hits the marks on that count, but it is poorly made. I returned the first one that I purchased because the roadway did not move as it is supposed to. The second one I received moves intermittently. If we jiggle it or move the shifter back and forth, it will start moving again.I kept the toy because both my kids (1 and 2 1/2) seem to enjoy it regardless. We let them play with it in the car on our long drive back from visiting relatives for the holidays, and it kept them both occupied for some time.I did not find it too loud or annoying, as other reviewers did, though both kids seemed to want to move the shifter into reverse position and leave it there, which means that it beeps like a truck backing up."
3,LOUD,This toy is so loud my three year old covered her ears when she started playing with it. You can hear it two rooms away. Definitely not for use in a car. Does not have a volume control either.
3,"Loud, no volume control, and doesn't shut up","It is a cool concept, very entertaining for the baby, but IT WON'T SHUT UP. On most of these dashboard toys, the baby turns the key, and an engine noise goes for a few seconds. On this one, the engine noise goes on indefinitely, and by engine noise, I mean ridiculously loud grinding noise that sounds more like a blender than a car. Also, there is no way to turn the volume down. Fun fun fun. It is tolerable if you cover the speaker with duct tape to muffle the volume. Oh, and the cell phone that comes with it has the exact opposite problem. You can barely hear it."
3,"Loaded, but annoying","I wanted to get my 15 month old son a steering wheel toy since he had been so fascinated by them. While this toy is loaded- it has turn signals, different songs on the radio, windshield wipers, different horn sounds, car alarms, side view mirror, etc., etc., it is quite annoying. I wished I had been forewarned that there isn't a volume or on/off button. So beware parents! What we've had to resort to doing is hiding it until it's a more appropriate time of day to hear the car alarm being pushed continuously for 5 minutes straight. Kids on the other hand will love this toy. Lots of sounds and buttons to push."
2,Broke in less than 2 months,"My 1 yr old grandson really liked it, but it broke after normal use after a few weeks. Like another customer here, it doesn't ""drive"" anymore and started making odd sounds. SInce it's after 30 days Amazon won't do anything and Small World Toys says they dont send any replacements. I would not purchase any Small World Toys in the future. I have not seen such bad customer service before."
3,awesome toy- but broked within a month,"I loved this toy! My daughter enjoyed it very much! It is very realistic! The radio and windshield wippers were a great touch! My daughter loved the sounds it made and enjoyed dancing along to the radio. She also enjoyed the cellphone, that also made noises. The only thing I would improve on this toy is the volume. It should have a volume control because sometimes it gets very loud. Overall this toy is very fun and interactive!I have to add that the toy is 30 days old and is now broked- the shifter and car that drive are stuck and make an odd noise. This a nice toy but not as durable as I would have liked for $35"
1,Too loud,This product is a fun idea with lots of stuff to do but so obnoxiously loud that we are returning it.
5,-- creatively revolutionary --,"This is one of the few Christian hip-hop albums that is not laden in cheese. The lyrics are real, raw, and emotional, detailing real life struggles and real life victories. The cuts used are by far creative, and dare I say experimental, avoiding the mainstream plethora of cheap sounding drum machines and tired rhythms.All of this is to say that the album is well worth, at the least, to listen to you, if not to buy. There are few tracks that are mediocre."
4,Proves How Unfair the Mainstream Rap Industry Is,"Luke Geraty * It's Cold Out Here (Syntax, 2003)""All the monkeys get on up?"" ... Did I hear that wrong? That's the problem with labels that don't print their artists' lyrics with the liner notes. But I'm sure that I heard that right.That one phrase reminded me of a racially charged scene from JOHN SINGLETON's film, ""Higher Learning"", starring OMAR EPPS & MICHAEL RAPPAPORT; a scene where Michael's character mentioned tying his belt around Omar's neck and making him be his monkey ... So I suggest that Luke consider which neighborhoods he performs that particular song in. I'd hate for it to cause him any problems.Other than that, Geraty extends the reach of his previously released EP, offering great chill music with unique samples and relaxing flows.Picks: Last Episode Of Funk/ Sunset Of Smiles/ Satan's Little Angel/ A Day In The Life/ Pandemonium/ FootprintsFor Fans of: Pigeon John/ KJ52Positive Beat Digest"

3,"I believe EFT works, but...","I gave it 3 stars because I tried the book out for hours and hours and hours, between 9am to 8pm, with breaks in between, and I did this for 5 days, but I think my issue may be too deep or something. I need a professional. Also the book protocols have you skip alot of points to tap, which is odd.... like for example, under the eye, under the nose, and under arem for one issue, and another issue calls for under eye, under nose,colarbone, underarm and colarbone again....and thats it.... maybe that is why it didnt work for me. Maybe I need to tap on all points like the traditional way. I even did the colarbone breathing daily before the polar reversal and balance breathing before each tapping session with no relief at all. I know it works if you are doing it right, but the books way seems different . I got no relief, not even a lower susd number scale. I wish it would work though, I was really counting on it to work."

2,"Good, though not as strong as I like my tea.","The taste of the tea is good, though I like my tea a lot stronger than this for a morning kick start."
3,"Half the Tea, Same Price","I like strong tea and I like PG Tips. That I am unhappy is partially my own fault. I didn't read the description closely enough. I thought their tea always came in their 'pyramid' tea bags, which have a lot more tea than a normal sachet bag. When I received these boxes filled with small, thin bags, each in its own envelope - which seems like excessive packaging - I was disappointed. There is not enough tea in a single bag to make me happy. I have to double-bag every cup. So it was not a good deal price-wise for me either. I will not get these again. I will wait for a good price on their boxes of pyramid-style bags, or buy Tetley's or Red Rose Tea when it goes on sale at Safeway."
3,open seam on brand new toy,"I was really excited to receive this puppy: adorable, perfect size for my little girl. However when I opened the package I noticed that there is a half inch open seam above the leg and the stuffing is exposed. I wish that it came in perfect condition."
3,"Cute, but small","The stuffed animal itself is really cute....but it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It fits pretty well in my husband's hand. I was hoping for a somewhat bigger version, but overall it's nice. The barking sound is legit, and sounds real, not all annoying and stuff."

The steel connection between the heels and the sole of the shoes are very poorly connected. for shoes that I put on and find that way i was not impressed. And i purchased all three colors. The only pair that does not wobble is the gunsmoke - but this is not to say it won't or will wobble for you. This is my experience and I won't be able to get this problem fixed.
5,The Magic Still Flows...,These guys have kept the magic flowing through my senses...straight to the heart. Amazing would be just a small word to appreciate....
4,5.1 Wins Again!,"Anyone who listens to 5.1 surround version of albums already knows how much better it makes the music sound. This album is no exception. Although it seems to lack in bass, it was nice to hear alternate versions of the songs that appear on the original album, most having a longer play time. Add to that the videos that were included and you have yourself a great little ""Slippery When Wet"" package. And I can't forget to credit the often-too-greedy record companies for releasing this DualDisc at an excellent price!"
4,Great Book,Got this book because Rush is an ancestor of mine. Gave me lots of insight into what a true patriot really is.
5,Unsung Hero,"A 1912 New York Times front page headline read: Titantic: UNSUNG HEROES OF THE ENGINE ROOM; ChiefBell's Men Kept Titanic's Lights Burning Until She Went Down.Benjamin Rush was the ""Chief Bell"" of the American Revolution and, (praise the Lord) the ship didn't go down.Rush kept the light of hope and faith burning in the hearts of the revolutionary giants. Of John Adams, Patrick Henry, Franklin and Jefferson we are all familiar. This book shows us that Rush was their hero."
2,Purposeful poor design,"As an ASE qualified Automotive Master Technician, I see it again and again. Low grade internal seal material, and a design that uses very small melt marks in the plastic to hold them together. I wonder how many vehicles go every year without a cap and spew 100s of thousands of pounds of hydrocarbon (gasoline) pollutants into the air. I find it so wrong for a company to create a product like this, then become regulated by law because it is such crap, then whine and fight... and LOBBY against rules to force them to make a reasonable product. But then that is what Corporate America is about right. Profits before mankind. Shame on you Stant."
2,not an exact match,"I had troubles with the original cap, so I decided to give a try to this one.Although it fits on the tank it does not on the holder that attaches to it. Meaning you have to keep it at sight when fueling and remember to put it back.Plus first time that I used it,gave a check engine warning. next few times it did not I give the benefit of doubt, perhaps it was my fault that I left it a little loose."
4,Sugarcane forever,"Don Sugarcane Harris is the funkiest violin player I have ever come across - just listen to ""The Buzzard's Cousin""! He has recorded at least half a dozen of his own LPs and has played the violin on dozens of other records (with Frank Zappa, John Mayall...) - all on vinyl. It is incredible that this gifted man's music had almost disappeared - until this anthology came out - the day he passed away much too soon. The anthology contains a good cross-section of Sugarcane's work. I can hardly wait for the next volume of the anthology."
5,outdoor sink,"Although we haven't installed the sink yet, it looks perfect for ourproject, which will be on the wall of our rooftop patio. The price was right,delivery was prompt, and the sink is attractive."
5,Excellent Product,"Best price I could find on these 1 1/2"" pocket hole screws. The screws are of very good quality, better than any others I have found. I use the Porter Cable jig not the Kreg jig and these work perfectly."
1,American Sea Shanties and Songs,"Disappointing. If American sailors only went to sea in single-handed boats, this would be good. Too much explanation, and most songs are sung by a single person (who may have personally sung them on whaling ships under sail). Not something one could sing along with, not 'easy' to listen to."
2,certainly not the best.,"The recordings are from Alan Lomax. The date on the CD says it was originally released in 1952.The quality of the recordings make it sound as if they were not remasteredThe songs are all acapella and the voices are rough.The tempo of the songs are slow, as they should be.Its authentic, but not very musical."
1,"wow, just wow","ok, this just sucked beyond imagining. The recording quality was bad enough to barely be able to understand what was said of sung. there were long drawn out introductions before each track which were also hard to understand and not neccessary.I died a little on the inside after listening to this."
2,So so game,"Red Faction is a first person shooter that contains the only geo-mod engine found in a FPS. With it comes frame-rate problems. Yes, it's fun to blow a hole in the roof and plug the trigger happy guards full of lead but it's missing a certian spark Half-Life had. What it all boils down to is a game that lacks qualities of a top seller. Why do we MAC users get dumped with all the [stuff] from the PC's?"
2,Pop-up broke on first try,"My infant son is fascinated by pop-up books and I've always loved them since I was a child. I am a civil engineer, and I was really looking forward to using this book to introduce my son to the construction industry. The book was pretty [$$$], but I figured it would be worth it. Wrong! The pop-ups are very elaborate and when we got to the last page where the city is supposed to pop up, the buildings tore off the page. I tried to tape them back in, but no luck. I guess this book will have some use - it can teach my son about poor engineering design."
5,Good Flash Drive,So far I am happy with Lexar's Sport JumpDrive. I have the 256mb and the 64mb versions. Once you get the rubber cap off it works well (many people knock the rubber cap but it is there for a reason).
2,Failed after eight months,It was great . . . but now I see that my experience is the same as that of other purchasers.
1,disappointed user,"I have had the Lexar sport drive for 2 years and loved it. easy to use and worked like a charm until a few months ago, when I began to get messages that told me the drive was full. Deleting files didn't help and I finally realized that instead of 256 MB of memory, I had about 32 KB. So something happened along the way and the drive is now useless. I would not recommend this product."
3,Durable but inconvenient,This has been a durable jump drive. I've had it for a year now. The problem is I have to insert it 8 times before it is recognized by most computers that I try to use it on. That can be frustraing and inconvenient.
2,Case breaks,The rubber casing/holder is a great idea. Except that it breaks and then falls off your keychain never to be seen again. Try a different product.
4,Excellent Flash Drive but beware of expired promotionals!,"I really appreciate the fact that they are finally shrouding portable drives like this wisely in some kind of rubber or elastomer. This is my second drive and this one can actually take quite a beating!My only problem and concern with this product is that Lexar still advertised an extened rebate system at the time which unfortunately for me expired before I purchased the drive online. It's nearly impossible to discover on Amazon until it's too late, so research this drive on other seller's sites (Staples, Office Depot) to make sure that this (or any) rebate is still legit!"
1,I hate this drive,"I bought it thinking it will be a sturdy drive, and Lexar anyway had a good name in flash drives.But to my utter dissapointment, barely 2 months after use, it started behaving funny. It won't copy data(1 file) more than 20-30 MB. While copying back (more than 100mb) data from this drive to my laptop it will hang and then computer will not be able to read it (I tried with 3 laptops!). Maybe it has bad sectors, but its as good as a floppy disk for me now. And I'm using it only for sharing keeping small amount of data.Highly dissapointed ..."
4,Real Nice...,"I had this over 2 years now.. I and it is used with all my keys and I do use without any ""proper care"" I might say, and I am very pleased with it....As for the indication of light on it, yes..It has a tiny light, but it does not creat a big problem...And you have to decide if you want your flash drive around your neck (not the case with this one) or with your keychain...I give it a Great ""GO FOR IT"" with this one, since it has been serving me well...I take it to my swimming practice table, which means it gets wet everytime I get out of the pool and pick the keys up in order to leave to the locker room, and never had a problem with it...Sport yes.. Not extreme... Of course...I am looking for a bigger size now... Of the same model...You will definatelly like this one...:-)"
4,"works well, good price, a little big, hard to use","Works well and is a good price, but is a little big for comparable products and the rubber holder is hard to get on and off. The key loop should be part of the drive rather than part of the holder so if it comes off the holder, you don't lose the drive."
5,Wonderful Purchase,"I needed this drive for college. I bought it and have used it in home computer, work computer, and various computers on campus. It has been recognized immediately on every PC running Windows XP and has performed flawlessly. Definitely a great purchase, and with the rebate, it is an unbeatable price. Enjoy!"
2,Little Book - Big Disappointment,"This book had huge potential from my point of view. For the cost I was expecting something akin to the other WROX titles ""Visual Basic 2005, Programmer's Reference"" and ""Visual Basic 2005 Database Programming"". The book starts out fine, covers the basics and then leaves the reader high and dry as far as a reference. The companion VB book has 1000+ pages, this book doesn't even make it to 400 pages (60 pages of which is a lexical grammar)."
1,What a waste of paper!,"I've bought this ""book"" couple of years ago and I still remember it. I started to read it on train, after one hour I wanted to throw it out of the window... How could have Wrox published something like that? How can Amazon sell it?"
1,Poor Fit,"I had to replace the original wooden stock on my 870 recently and bought this set. The fit of the stock to the receiver was horrible. As a previous reviewer noted, there was a significant gap between the rear of the receiver and the the new stock when installed. I had to file down the new stock to create a reasonable fit. It's still wide around the edges where the receiver meets the stock, but if I file that down, I'll go right through the camo finish on the new stock. For something from the Remington brand, I would expect a better fit onto a Remington shotgun.Even though I didn't need it, I installed the new forend, as well. It went on fine, once I got the forend tube nut off and then on again. That was a small challenge."
5,"12"" x 15"" Plastic Oval Sink","I have a 1984 Airstream travel trailer and had looked several years for this item as a ""replacement"" for the original, and this was it!"
4,Good Cooking,"I recently bought this book for my boyfriend for his birthday, and I must say, we both love it. He has this new cooking frenzy going on, and I am enjoying every bit of it, because I love to eat. We are both fish lovers, so this book has been very helpful to the both of us. The recipes are tasty and healthy as well. I would recommend it to anyone that likes to eat fish."
1,AWFUL!,"That's the only word for it! Awful. If I could give it no stars, I would. The young actress that plays young Anne is the ONLY good thing about this film. I hope she goes on to bigger and BETTER things."
1,Disappointment,"I can't understand why the director of this movie would stray SO far from the established story. Killing off Gilbert? Seriously? Making Marilla into a liar who kept things from Anne? Diana had next to zero part of the storyline?Even apart from those issues, this movie on its own doesn't hold up. Parts of the plot are never developed or explained. The pace is terribly slow. It was nice to see cameos of Mrs. Lynde and Aunt Hettie from Avonlea, but that's not enough of a reason to watch this movie. Very disappointing."
4,Another brilliant Sullivan production!,Kevin sullivan continues to inspire and perpetuate our love of PEI and all things Anne Shirley! It is a family friendly movie with mild thematic elements surrounding the trials of extreme poverty. The cast included some cameo appearances from the original movies and some great performances from veteran Sullivan actors which I truly enjoyed!!Will watch again and will count the days until his next movie release![...]
2,Not what we expected.,"This is not what I expected. No one can act the part of Anne like Megan Fellows. I know she would be to old now for that part, but I thought at least, they could have gotten her for the part of the older Anne."
1,This is a crime against Anne Shirley,"If I could give it no stars I would. This was so bad, LM Montgomery must be rolling over in her grave. Boring, cliched, ripped off the Anne books, but without grace or style. Heavy handed and smarmy. Was there a poor orphan cliche he didn't use? Oh wait, she didn't get pressed into the Navy, but that was it! The real Anne isn't perfect and so long suffering. I know because I've read the books! Too bad Sullivan can't be charged with something and barred from ever doing anything Green Gables related again. Sad, because he started out well. Not sure what happened, but it isn't pretty. Or entertaining.The credits were good. It was such a relief to get to the end (even with fast forwarding it went on too long!)"
2,not for me,the movie was ok but not what I thought i liked that they showed her past but it is unbelievable and crappy
1,worst adaptation ever,"A New Beginning is completely that...the whole story line was changed and made Anne a liar. Any true fan knows that Anne is honest. The acting by the young Anne was over the top and the quotes were all copied from the other movies. The magical world of Anne Shirley is completely ruined in this movie and it is utterly disappointing. If I could give zero stars, I would. Kevin Sullivan, what were you thinking???"
1,A disgrace,"I had to come on here after sitting through this movie just to vent somewhere about it! This is truly the most pathetic excuse of a movie ever. And to use the Anne of Green Gables books in vain like this is a kind of sacrilege. I can only think Kevin Sullivan is a very disturbed man to have taken something so beautiful and morphed it into this ugly movie. I borrowed this DVD from the library and actually felt compelled to stick a note inside the cover saying ""Warning (especially to all Anne of Green Gables fans) this is a truly AWFUL movie"". And yes, like other reviewers I would've given it zero stars if I could."
1,save your money and your time,WTF???? This is completely wrong and a horrible corruption of the wonderful Anne of Green Gables series (both the books and the movies). What were they thinking?!?!? I would advise you save your time and money for something more worthwhile. This isn't worth even a free rental.
1,O dear,"I can't believe the price of this DVD.Amazon mostly has the best price but in this case it is actually cheaper to buy it directerly from Sullivan entertainment's website. It is over $10.00 less in price.I have seen a clip of this movie and it is so wrong,EVERYTHING has been turned around making all other Anne of Green Gables movies into lies and ruining what the original writter wrote. I love Anne of Green Gables and Sullivan Entertainment, but this just is wrong. So I will probably NEVER look at this movie."
1,Lost respect for Kevin Sullivan,"I've lost all respect for Sullivan. If he wants to write fictitious characters and plots, he's free to do so, but he should make up his own characters and not hijack established and well-loved ones."
5,Pretty,"My sis wanted this because she is into this 'butterfly' phase. It's exactly the way you see it. For the price it's an excellent gift for a sibling, as a friendship ring and for young loved ones. Or just for yourself as an everyday ring."
1,Mismatched Item Picture and Description,"The bird feeder sent to me did not match the picture, not even close, and I had to return it to Grady's Ace Hardware for a refund. The return process was a little slow but the person I contacted was pleasant and helpful. They also provided for and paid for the pickup by UPS so it didn't cost me anything. Based on this I would recommend making purchases from Grady's Ace Hardware but also suggest paying closer attention to making sure the pictures match the descriptions, unlike what I did."
1,Picture of Item Misleading,"I bought two of the item that is shown at the right of this page. That is not what was delivered. They had to issue a return label for it. You should update your web pages to show the correct picture. As I can see, it is still not fixed.I am very dissatisfied with this particular purchase, and I do not see my refund yet either."
1,thanks glen,"""I Am Shelby Lynne"" was one of the best albums of 1999. Like other reviewers, I was highly anticipating the release of ""Love, Shelby."" I'll probably never listen to it again. This album was produced by Glen Ballard, which explains the abundance of slickness and the absence of soul. It sounds like they are shooting for a Top 40 audience....quite sad. The remake of Lennon's ""Mother"" is ridiculous, and I would say the best song on here is ""Killin' Kind"", which was released on the ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" soundtrack prior to this album's release. Overall, a huge disappointment!!"
2,this one is sorta a let down...,"I wasn't a bit put off by the ""trashy"" lp cover. Heck, that's how I dress. I put the cd on w/an open mind, and... well, these songs just aren't as strong as I AM SL. Therefore this cd just doesn't stick in my cd player as long. Her voice is still excellent and if you really enjoyed the last one it's worth owning just for her voice. I like Tarpolean Napoelon alot, and Trust & Wall in your Heart. I do think the lp suffers in general from overproduction. Shelby has a strong voice and style- I just don't think she needs all the Ballard-esque tricks."
2,"""NG""","After ""I Am"" one would have high expectations for Shelby. Starting from the cover art, one should be instantly skeptical of this album. It is almost as if this album was made by a different person."
3,"Curse of ""best new artist"" Grammy?","Please let's just all chalk this one up to the curse of the ""Best New Artist"" Grammy. Invariably, everyone who has ever one the Grammy for ""Best New Artist"" stumbles shortly thereafter... Don't write off Shelby Lynne because of this mis-step. People just put WAY too much faith in Glen Ballard, who hasn't had a success since Alanis (which was a huge success, but his first big success and sadly, his last). When Shelby takes back control of her music, she will shine once again. She has one of the best voices in rock/country history."
1,Sophomore *slump*? She jumped off a cliff!,"I bought this CD in spite of the ridiculous cover, because ""I Am Shelby Lynne"" was my favorite album of 2000. But apparently Bill (Sheryl Crow) Botrell's production and collaboration deserved much of the credit for that. The new release, with Glen (Alannis Morrissette) Ballard at the helm, is awful. It appears that Shelby is only as good as her collaborators, and that's a shame."
5,Great,"Shelby Lynne once again moves into new territory with her newest album LOVE SHELBY. Her last album I AM SHELBY LYNNE garnered a lot of attention, which it rightfully deserves. People are quick to compare, which is fair, but this album stands on its own as it is a complete different musical direction for Shelby. This time working with Glen Ballard (Alanis Morrissette). Shelby co-wrote most of the album, as well wrote some songs by herself. The music is very americana like, in songs like ""Jesus on a Greyhound"". ""Trust Me"", and ""Bend"" are surefire hits if released to radio. ""Wall In Your Heart"" is a beautiful midtempo song. ""I Can't Wait"" tells the story of someone longing for love. ""Mother"" is a cover of the John Lennon song. Its overall a great album and everyone should give it a listen, youll be pleasantly surprised!"
3,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this CD. Her previous effort, ""I am Shelby Lynne"" is great. The new CD opens with two great songs. ""Trust Me"" and ""Bend"" are Shelby at her best. But then things mostly fall apart afterwards. ""Jesus on a Grayhound"" is really awful. And the rest of the CD is just OK. Nothing special. After the first two songs I thought this might be a major breakthrough CD for her but most of it is puzzling and downright banal."
4,shelby's cool,"This is a pretty good alt-country/pop album from Shelby Lynn. It doesn't fit neatly into any genre or category. Shelby definitely does her own thing and this album is different and interesting, after you let it grow on you a bit. Pretty cool."
4,Nice surprise...,"I thought this was going to be Shania/Faith but it's much closer to Sheryl/Lucinda. It's pretty rootsy, she writes her own songs and she doesn't practice any of the extreme vocal exercises of the aforementioned. The one cover she does is John Lennon's ""Mother"" which I thought was a brave but odd choice until I read that her father killed her mother in a murder/suicide. One other positive point...she's really hot in a trampy way, which works for me! Plus there's a poster included!"
3,OH WELL....,"I have been a fan of Shelby Lynne's since Sunrise. She could go into the recording studio and spit in the microphone and I would probably buy it, a voice like that only comes around once in a very long while. The vocals are top-notch but the song writing .... I live for the day that Shelby does a covers album because nobody can interpret like her (allowing for the exception of the great Eva Cassidy) as the cover of Mother bears out."
2,What a let down!,"I was really excited for Lynne's new album, but after my first listen, I discovered the critics were correct. It's bad! The only decent songs on the album are the two written solely by Lynne (""Tarpoleon Napoleon"" and ""Killin' Kind""). Let's just say the addition of new writing partner/producer Glen Ballard was a BAD choice!Stick with ""I Am Shelby Lynne"" and the ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" Soundtrack!"
2,Very elementary and not much info here,"I found this book to be very limited in regard to content. I was looking for more advanced techniques, or at least a more detailed study of actual methods for accomplishing what the title advertises. The author could have presented the main points of this book on a few pages and saved us all the time required to read the filler material. Just about any book you pick up about public speaking or personal communication contains the advice found here. ""Repeat the question - It gives you a few more seconds to think about your answer"" is about as advanced as the info in this book gets."
4,1st cut is great. Its all downhill from there.,"I ENJOYED THE CD IN ITS ENTIRETY. tHE 1ST CUT IS THE SELLER OF THE CD. tHE GROUP IS NICE,SINGER IS GOOD;HOWEVER THERE ARE TOO MANY ""SHALLOW"" MUSICAL GAPS. PERHAPS THE GROUP COULD ADD ANOTHER VOICE TO THE PRCEEDINGS(GUITAR??). TO PLAY THE ""LEADS"",""FILLS"",ETC. HORNS ARE GREAT..."
5,Outstanding balance of theory and application,"Very useful reference. Assuming you know other aspects of ceramics, this book seems to contain all the info you need to succeed with cone 6 glazes. It's not only for cone 6 though, because much of the info will apply to other glazes as well. Includes a solid explanation of glaze theory, balanced by a wealth of very detailed and practical considerations for getting the best possible results in the real world."
3,"Limited in scope, not for beginners.","I'm giving this three stars not because it's a bad book - it's excellent for its purpose - but that purpose is MUCH less broad than some other reviews indicate. The authors have studied glaze durability in incredible detail, and explain very thoroughly how to run careful, professional tests of glaze strength, fit, and color leaching. But all the other advice is very ad hoc and incomplete.The book feels meant to plug common holes in the knowledge of a slightly miseducated reader; a beginner will not be able to pick it up and learn how glazes work, or how to develop or modify recipes. It's called ""Mastering"" for a reason; don't buy it unless you're at least at an intermediate level already."
5,Paid for Itself Day 1,"I haven't tried the recipes in this book yet, since I just read it over weekend, but I will say this book paid for itself day one in my opinion. It did this by alerting me to obtain the MSDS (materials safety data sheet) for all the materials in my studio. This caused me to look up all the MSDS for all the glazes we use in the studio, only to find out that one of the Laguna glazes we've been using, ""Desert Yellow"", has up to 5% Barium in it, which the authors don't recommend for use in functional glazes due to its high toxicity! Turns out ""food safe"" labeling only addresses the use of lead and cadmium. Sheez! We've been using this glaze with beginning students. Thanks ""Mastering Cone 6 Glazes"" I'm learning something on every page."
5,Mastering cone 6 glazes,"Excellent book,full of info.Have been doing pottery and glazes for 20 years and this book has answered a lot of questions for me.Highly reccomend this book for anyone inerested in pottery glazes."
5,Purchased as a gift,"Bought this as a gift for our son who does pottery and as he thumbed throught it, he liked a lot of what he saw."
5,just seems to be one of the best,"This book I've had for some time now. I have been a cone 6 potter for many years now. I've used many of the recipes in this book and have also experimented and modified a few of them. The glazes are rock solid and dependable. For those who would like to mix their own glazes, this is a great resource. The technical glaze chemistry information is there for you to learn about as well. Chemistry is not my strong suit, but this book makes it understandable. I look at other books as well, but I seem to come back to this one more than any other. I like to dip one glaze over another on most of my wares, and most of the recipes you can do that. I've tried a few different colorants in the base glazes and have come up with a few good ones. It is pretty cool to be able to make up your own glazes and you know what's in it."
5,The Best (and only) Glaze Book You'll Ever Need!,"After experimenting with glaze recipes online and in other books, I found these glazes to be the most stable and truest to their pictures. The glazes are from basically the same base (with slight changes), and so they work well with each other to create amazing color combinations and effects. I cannot stress enough how awesome this book is. Our other glaze book will be getting quite dusty, while we use, reuse, and create new glazes with this wonderful foundation for glazes. I'm tempted to try the glaze software by the same people to create new recipes."
5,Good for a massage ball!,"I got this as a massage ball- for glutes and back areas. Many Physical Therepists recommend this and it works as well as othe more expensive products. For the price, can't beat it. I don't play Lacrosse, so I can't speak to how good it is for that."
5,America The Expansion!,"Each of the four factions from the original game gets two new missions, a new unit, and a new building. The graphics and AI have been updated and GameSpy online support is now included. There is also a level editor for creating your own missions."
5,A Wake-Up Call,"Wow! What a wake-up call for the current American suburban life style and the often dysfunctional values that sustain it. From our hour-plus commutes in mind numbing traffic, to our grossly overpriced cookie-cutter tract homes, to the always busy, busy, busy moms and dads shuttling kids from one programmed activity to another, this is a shocking and all too accurate portrait of the American ""anxious class.""It is unlikely that anybody could watch this 90-minute documentary without sensing their daily personal reality slapping them in the face. This powerful video brought to mind the lyrics of John Lennon from a bygone era, ""A working class hero is so hard to be. They keep you doped on religion, sex and TV. And you think you're so clever and classless and free. But you're still [just] peasants as far as I can see!"" Perhaps it's time for all of us to reevaluate the American dream... that is unless your house is already in foreclosure."
3,Good Unit . . Terrible FM,"What the other two reviewers say about this CD/radio is basically true. Good sound. Unique, good looks. Simple controls (though some buttons and text are quite tiny). However, the FM tuner on mine is truly terrible - unlistenable on most stations. Using this radio, a few strong stations drown out almost everything else on the dial, giving you what sounds like multiple stations on top of each other. Don't even consider this product if listening to FM is important to you. By the way, this is not an ""alarm clock"". It has a clock but no alarms."
1,"PIECE OF JUNK Teac SL-D80 Nostalgia CD Player with AM/FM Radio, Silver","Beautiful on my shelf but after sitting unused and unplugged for 6 months, the FM has no reception, the AM only gets one channel but the volume is so muted I have to put my hear next to it to hear, the CD does not work ( I reset it and played with it over I hour). Also, the red indicators do not work. The radio has no longevity but again, it has an attractive case. PIECE OF TRASH!"
4,could not put it down,"I really enjoyed this book! It was nice to see gay characters in a decent story that doesn't revolve around sex. Well worth the price, you wont be disappointed!"
5,Another good read,"This is another great book by Rob Kaufman. Twists and turns, love and deception make it a book you won't want to put down."
2,Neat Idea but...,"I purchased all four Mug'em books. They all have some really neat ideas, but be warned that what you give away does not include all the necessary ingredients. With some of them the recipient only needs to add simple things like water and other common household ingredients. Some require the addition of small amounts of things most people don't normally keep in their house and probably wouldn't purchase just for the small quantity needed. Other items require the recipient to add so many things that you might as well have not given the gift to begin with.I suggest you do a search online for free postings of similar gifts to give in a mug, or purchase the Gifts in a Jar books."
2,"Great Idea, but I returned it because...","This book used regular ingredients, but many were baked in the oven for 30 minutes or so. I was looking for quick & easy recipes. I returned the book since I was so disappointed with it.As for using the book as a gift giving idea, it would be easy with all the labels/tags included as part of the book, but the recipient is really getting ""mugged"" into doing a lot of cooking for some of the recipes that serves one. You also have to make sure the mugs are microwave and/or oven safe which ends up being another issue to deal with before giving the gifts."
3,soup and breads,I bought the Mug 'Ems Soups and Breads for my son to make Christmas gifts for all of his grandparents. Three of the soup recipes we picked called for Knorr White Sauce which is apparently not available anywhere in the U.S. We were very disappointed in the soups but the book is a great idea and some of the breads sound yummy. We were just looking for simple!
4,tips to take or leave,"Fly-Tying Tips & Reference Guide is a useful reference, providing tips on how to use unconventional materials in your fly tying. I bought it, and read it cover to cover fairly shortly thereafter. I found a lot of seemingly useful tips and ideas.As a source of ideas, it's a good read. As a reference, it suffers a bit because the author organizes tips into only broad categories. Fortunately, it's not encyclopedic, so the tips are fairly easy to find again when you need them.I think this book is probably most useful for beginning to novice fly tyers who are just finding their tying voice and seeking creative and cost-effective ways to improve their craft."
4,Very good for English speaking students of the Thai language,"This book is short but well written. It will take you through all the seemingly endless curves and tricks of the written language and is excellent for those who are about to make a trip to Thailand, especially if you will not be in the ""touristy"" areas of the country.The only slight drawback is that some of the Thai text is very hard to read because it is blurry or too small, but is otherwise a very good learning tool. You will be reading in less than a month if you are determined."
2,There are better (and newer) books on the subject.,"This book has all the facts, but the text is very hard to make out, like a bad photocopy. I was hoping this book would shed light on some of the more obscure rules, like the character (ra rua) appearing twice in the same word without tone marks is the same as the short vowel (mai han-aa-gaat) but found none of that. This book also shows its age, having been written in 1955, stating that ""satang"" = ""1/100th of a Tical"" (the old currency of thailand). I found that the pages were packed with text, and this made it difficult to follow. I would reccomend the books by Benjawan Poomsan Becker over this title. While I am not a novice, I found trying to decipher the phonetic alphabet was annoying, I favor phonetic spelling but with a transliteration that you can actually read along with it, such as the system found in Robertsons Practical Thai-English Dictionary by AsiaBooks. In all, I would pass on this book if I had to do it again."
5,As awesome as ever!,"My husband and I are die hard Criminal Intent lovers. We don't have cable/HD TV, so we buy it by the season when the newest one comes out. Both being hard core Goren fans, we were a little bereft when the seasons started having him in only half the episodes (with Chris Noth being in the other). However, whether it is a Goren or Logan episode, Criminal Intent is as awesome as ever. In this season there were moments where we literally gasped out loud at the plot twists! Oh joy! As usual, we tore through the whole season in no time, and are now impatiently awaiting season 6! :) We highly recommend this to fellow Criminal Intent enthusiasts."
5,Excellent Book!,"The Rebbe's Army by Sue Fishkoff is an excellent exploration into the world of Hasidic Jews, specifically the Chabad Lubavitch. For over a year Fishkoff interviewed members from this group with wonderful reesults for her readers. The account she gives tells us what motivates the Chabad Lubavitch and also explains about their far reaching attempts to engage the greater population in their causes. From a somewhat small group of European Jews led by Rebbe Schneerson, today the Chabad Lubavitch are all over the world engaging and encouraging others to join with them How did they go from a rather small group to a billion dollar organization recognized by celebrities and even the White House. These and many other questions are answered in The Rebbe's Army which I found truly fascinating. If you have any interest in religions and especially this specific group, which has in the past been little understood, you owe it to yourself to read this book."
3,Not bad !,"I was quite impressed with the list of folks that Sue Fishkoff had interviewed for this book. And the chapter subjects are also quite nicely done. The one thing I didn't like, and I admit, I am a traditional guy, was her knocking the ways of Chabad due to her ""enlightened"" mind and views. 'Twas a pity to read of her secular upbringing, which explains her views, but I was disappointed nonetheless. All in all, though, a thoroughly enjoyable read."
3,The Rebbe's Army,"Good journalism, easy reading, more detail than ""necessary"" but an entertaining insight into a world that I've known about only superficially for many years."
3,My Friends the Lubavitch,"The Rebbe's Army: Inside the World of Chabad-LubavitchI feel that this book should be used as a text book. It is very informative but only on one subject. It is sometimes not easy reading. I knew some of the people mentioned in the book. If you are orthodox, it is good as a reference book."
4,New understanding of Chabad,This is a movement I'm just becoming familiar with.The Rebbe is venerated. His followers appear to be ready to do his bidding as though they were soldiers in an army and he was the supreme commander.A real look at a differnet Jewish world.
5,"A fair-minded, balanced examination of Chabad","I am not Jewish, yet have studied with a Chabad rabbi for almost two decades, generally weekly except when the class does not meet (holidays, vacations, etc.) The subject matter relates to Orthodox Judaism's laws related to humanity's basic legal code known as the ""Laws of Noah."" In these nearly two decades, I have observed the same kindness and non-judgmental hospitality described in THE REBBE'S ARMY. At no time have I been pressured to covert (to Judaism). All this to say THE REBBE'S ARMY was a wonderful introduction to understanding my Torah instructor's world; a world where Jew and Righteous Gentile labor in God's service to bring a little heaven down to earth."
1,Appalling Bigots,"The above reviews typify the lowbrow adoration of Chabad and Hasidic bigotry and racism. Read Postville, for instance, written by a Jew about the Lubavitcher assault on an Iowa town. Better, even look into the many Jewish critiques of ultra-orthodox Jewry by reformist, conservative and secular Jews within Israel for a sense of how fundamentalist Judaism reeks of a hateful, inbred insanity -truly!Go to the website of Hemdat, which recounts tales of this breed assaulting old, Jewish women for using their electric wheelchairs on Saturday, or slinging their own excrement at synagogues they regard as deviant.The pretense that Hasids are even remotely spiritually generous to any human being outside of their narrow faith is complete stupidity, hypocrisy or cowardice.Like Bloom's work on Postville, the author here has failed completely to transcend her tribe in order to provide a fair critique of this entirely ugly movement."
4,Interesting and Insightful,"The only thing about this book that I didn't like was that it wasn't critical. It was very positive regarding the movement. Which is a good thing, it just would be nice to get varying perspective."
2,A disappointment,"Three tracks ""Que Pena Me Da "",""Te Borraré De Mi Mente"",""Sonero"" aren't sang by Oscar, who are those guys? Who cares, you pay for good food and received leftover....Why the piano solo was cut in ""Mis Hijos"" ??? Hello ??? It's one of the most enjoyable part of this song.....""Bájate De Esa Nube"" a pop balad ???, what is about ""Nostalgia "" a pop-cross-over experiment? Who the neck is calling those Gold Hits ????They're awful ....In previous compilations the sound quality is much better in plenty of the tracks, check ""Pensando En Ti"" a poor digital remasted work, really bad....In addition, too much of ""salsa monga"" or romantic salsa included....I'm sorry for Oscar, but don't get this one, not even for the price."
4,It fix my counter top,"My counter top chipped out in 2 small area. For the area is not too obvious. I just want to fix it instead of replace the whole counter top.After search the internet. This seems work so I give it a try. This fit the color and fix the counter top. You can hardly recognize the fixedat 1st glance. But if you look at it with an angle. You can find those fixed area do not have the glossy look as the original laminate area.This is why I took out 1 star. By the way, I find it dry very fast. If you completely follow the instruction, it may be too dry to make itlooks smooth."
3,Better than nothing.,"Takes a lot of fussing to get things to look just right. While it does fill a crack, it shrinks A LOT and needs several applications. Best used as a filler on already very tight seams."
3,Aspect Ratio Curiosity,"This isn't really a review of the DVD - I just wanted to point out something curious about the DVD's aspect ratio. Contrary to Amazon's Product Details section, the film is presented in a 16:9 ratio. This contrasts with the previous Greek version, which was presented in a 4:3 ratio. The curious thing is that neither version provides the entire picture. This version has picture on the sides that the Greek version doesn't, and the Greek version has picture on the top and bottom that this version doesn't. It's possible that the movie was filmed with a 5:3 (1.66:1) ratio, and both DVD versions chop off some picture. (Wikipedia echoes this, but provides no source for the information.) Maybe someone who's more knowledgeable could comment?"
5,Masterpiece,"I first seen this extraordinary movie while I was behind the Iron Curtain, holding no hope to be a free man...a Stavros like millions others. Little that I knew at the time that my dream would come through and one day I would be an American, almost the same way as the protagonist of this masterpiece. Forgive my obvious bias, do yourself a favor and see this movie."
5,not on DVD yet?,"I still can't figure out why this film is not on DVD yet while so much absolute tripe is. Which lobby, which studio exec is denying the public this remarkable film? It is a bit long, but that just means you can hit the pause button and get yourself another cup of Uzo!"
5,An Amazing Epic Journey of Everyman,"An amazing epic journey, filled with deep emotion, desire, and the longing a century ago for a Greek youth in Ottoman Turkey to beat all odds and come to America. As he put it, ""I have been beaten, robbed, stabbed and left for deat. I have eaten the Sultan's garbage and fought off dog's to get at it."" It is a universal story, an epic one, and a great motion picture too, perhaps one of the best, and it is the story of Elia Kazan's life. But for the fact that Kazan was banished from the industry for ""naming names,"" for being a ""police informer,"" this picture no doubt would have won many Oscars, including best picture of the year. But ""Tom Jones"" beat it out --a wonderful picture too, but not anywhere near Kazan's ""America America"" for insight, depth, and a real claim to an American hisory --the story of what America was all about to those ""wretched refuse of your teaming shore"" in 1900. Five stars and five stars more."
5,Rare and from another time,"i guess if its not entertainment its not on the spotlight.This is personal for Kazan as well for all the people who chose to watch this film.A rare insight on the period when the othomans practised ethnic cleansing and thats when his dream begins,to go to America the land of promise all equal under the law."
2,Solid if not spectacular Star Wars novel,"Book 2 of the Corellian Trilogy finds our heroes Han, Leia and their brood trapped on the worlds of Corellia, Selonia and Drall, while Luke and Lando rush off to borrow a fleet from a little world known as Bakura. It was great to see the return of Bakura to the Star Wars universe after a decently long time of neglect. The scenes with Luke and Lando are enthralling while other scenes show some flashes of brilliance, but overall this book is simply better than average. It suffers through a sophmore slump, parts of the book are just uninteresting. The writing stays fine, but the especially the scenes with Han Solo and his allies prove to be a bit drawn out and difficult to read. That said, Assualt at Selonia is still better than any of the KJ Anderson books in the Star Wars universe. It builds up very well towards the conclusion Showdown at Centerpoint."
5,Love it,Love star wars books. One of the best books series the is. Keep up the good work and keep them coming
3,This book had me asleep after 20 minutes.,This book was a usual second in a series of three. The author refused to end describing the supposed endless tunnels of Selonia. The only real excitement and enthusiasm that I expect from the Star Wars series was when one of the task force galactic ships was smashed. :-(
2,"The ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the Corellian Trilogy","For the second book in the series, we are basically given something to tide us over before the main events unfold... Helps build the story a little more, but that's about it. Do read it if you intend to read them all as it ties Ambush at Corellia and Showdown at Centerpoint together quite nicely. By itself, just plain confusing..."
2,Boring and duller yet,"This book did not pick up on action where Ambush at Correlia lacked. The title alone has nothing to do with Selonia, since the characters don't even land on Selonia until the third book of the triology. A major disappointment. As a Star Wars fan for the last 22 years, I am not all that pround in having this in my collection of Star Wars novels."
3,"Yes, I have to agree","This book was nothing out of the ordinary, one of the disappointments in life. It starts off with potential, only to fail soon after. It moves slowly, plot development not all that it could be, and the over all story lacking. If you don't have the time for a slow book, this may not be for you."
4,Doesn't work with the Blue Yeti or Blue Yeti Pro...,"Just to back up what Kyle said in previous review: This shock mount does not work with either the Blue Yeti or the Blue Yeti Pro microphones, no matter what you may have heard or read. I wish I had read Kyle's review before shelling out the bread for it. It is what it is. Having said that, it will work for almost any other mic you may own."
3,"tired of never ""knowing"" the end","I've read three in this series now and I'm a bit tired of there never being an ""ending""...i.e., you never find out what the Engines of God are, or what the Chindi is, or what the Omega's are. After three, 300 page or more, books and still no ""understanding,"" I'm over the series. I kept reading, thinking the explanation would come in the next book, but it never did. Also, while I loved the concept of this series, I started to skip pages of long, detailed, space rescues of people. It seemed each book contained rescue after rescue after rescue."
1,Narrow view of the future,"With the exception of FTL travel and extended life spans, the author creates a world two hundred years from now much like our own. It's hard to imagine that no other changes in technology or society will have occured in that span of time. This technique harkens back to the 50's when authors would extrapolate one trend in society to an extreme conclusion. While there might be adventure in the book as cited by other reviewers, I couldn't get that far because I found myself constantly saying ""that's preposterous"" when the characters reacted in an early 21st century fashion to a 23rd century situation."
2,"Had me, then lost me","I really enjoyed the first half of this book. The writing was intelligent, the science was good and the characters were believable. The excitement of investigating the source of a brief signal that was clearly alien in origin was nicely offset with a crew of individuals who's strength's and flaws were as real as any random gathering of individuals. Then stupidity hit. The consequences of a previous fatal decision are somehow justified away and, would you believe it, disaster strikes again! I cringed as this stupid decision played out but kept on reading only to see previously strong characters suddenly become wishy-washy and allow more stupidity. I tried to stay with it but finally gave up when I realized I no longer cared about any of the characters (other than the charming AI). Unfortunate. It was an exciting concept but I really have low tolerance for stupidity. Not recommended."
3,Didn't I just read this book?,"OK, so I love McDevitt and do recommend this book. But I'm starting to believe that if you've read one McDevitt novel you've read them all. The basic plotline of each novel is something like this: Hutch gets drafted/paid by a group of wreckless archaeologists to go explore a new find. The group gets picked off one by one in a series of incidents and accidents that Hutch warned them about--she occasionally saves them. The remainding people narrowly escape and there may nor may not be anything to show for it. This is pretty much the jist of Chindi. I enjoyed it because it deals with new worlds, aliens, adventure, danger, and discovery--the genre has an easy time with me. And though predictable and eventually tiring, the plots do deliver in the way your basic horror movie does. Think the idiots will go down in the basement? You bet they will!"
4,Well Written SciFi!!,"I luv this story, as well as much of Jack McDevitt's other work as well. I'm a pretty fussy and I've read a fair amount of science fiction as well as other genre's. However, McDevitt's work makes me feel as though I were there; granted it's far out stuff, but not too far out, and for me that's the key...it's a-l-m-o-s-t believable. One can feel the tension as well as adrenaline rush of sitting in earth orbit, looking out the window of a stuffy little corporate FTL spacecraft, waiting for the ""miracle"" of faster than light travel to begin; knowing that at the end of the journey (a few days, maybe a month or so) you'll be standing under the light of another sun, with good ol Sol now just a faraway pinpoint if even visible - awesome. So if you are wondering what the ""Chindi"" is, grab this book. One of his other books (Engine's of God) is excellent as well!"
4,"Great, solid, hard sci-fi read",Excellent job! Jack McDevitt has Orson Scott Card skills in character development and Heinlein-esque skills in coming up with hard-sci fi premises.Really a top notch book. 9 out of 10.-shannon norrell
2,The Mysteries Go Unanswered,"The book starts out rather slow, but the pace eventually picks up. However, in the end it doesn't matter. The book builds to a climactic ending THAT NEVER COMES. I have never felt so let down before. None of the mysteries are answered. What is the Chindi? What's it's purpose? What about the other ancient life discovered on the other worlds? It gave me a severe headache having all these questions go unanswered."
2,"Great potential, all but wasted","I loved the premise of this book: mankind has long been exploring space looking for life, finding nothing, when suddenly a small crew stumbles upon signs that some other race is out there... and watching.As evidence piles up, the book starts to get interesting. Why, for example, does one outpost resemble a human house on a hill, only overlooking two giant planets?The answer to this and dozens of other potentially interesting questions is missing.As other reviewers have mentioned, the book stalls and never gets going again. All the interesting questions are ignored.During the second half of the book I kept thinking: someone should rewrite the second half, because there are many ways to make this a great book.Unfortunately, the author chose none of them.And, yes, the characters repeatedly do incredibly stupid things."
2,Scifi has to start with sci,"Scifi has to start with science and then carry it beyond the known. The author of Chindi made some critical mistakes early on, which put me off for the rest of the book. Example: Suns ""burn"" because the Hydrogen fuses into other elements. Burning before fusion starts is an obvious mistake. Beyond that, the characters were not developed very well and the book dragged for long periods."
2,Can you plagiarize yourself?,"A nice mix of action and science fiction, Chindi helps move contemporary sci-fi away from the boring, pedantic grad student ramblings or poli-sci obsessions that are all too often replacing good storylines.I would have given it four stars but it is EXACTLY THE SAME STORY AS HIS EARLIER WORK ""DeepSix""! After enjoying Chindi I sought out more of his work and picked up DeepSix only to discover it is the same plot line with many of the same action sequences and basically the same dramatic climax. It was a good story once McDevitt; twice is just greedy laziness.I won't read any more of his work as I expect he will keep recycling the same story. But if you've never read any of his work and like Sci-fi that you can read without a CRC handbook then pick up a copy of Chindi."
4,A question??,"I just bought Chindi, because it was on display and it looked really good. I have just now found out that it is a sequel to two earlier books and is followed with Omega.Should I read Chindi first? Or should I read Engines of God and Deepsix first?Thanks!"
3,Decent First Contact Novel,"This is a fairly good first contact novel. McDevitt is a competent writer with a good imagination. In this book, he has incorporated the plot device of having the heroine's search for companionship mirror the search for extraterrestrial civilizations. The book displays good imagination and the basic plot device of discovering an advanced civilization systematically eavesdropping on emerging civilizations is clever and developed well. As commented by other reviewers, this book is too long. The plot elements become a bit gimmicky and the characters aren't developed well enough to sustain this length book."
3,"Interesting, but tedious; insufficiently believable","The basic premise of this book is really quite fascinating -- explorers from Earth discover a network of ""stealth"" satellites transmitting data from dozens of habitable worlds. The intrepid explorers follow the network to see what's behind it.Unfortunately, the book draws things out much longer than is necessary. The length would have been worthwhile if there were more character or plot development, but this was too much length for too little reward. And worst of all, characters are dying off in droves because of truly implausible bad decisions one after another. How many times can one group of characters be expected to say ""What's the worst that can happen?""?There's a delightful twist at the end, but I'm not going to read the next book just to find out where it leads."
2,BORING WITH NO CLIMAX,"Overdrawn and very boring novel, where not much happens. You could easily skip over 200 pages in the middle of the book and miss nothing"
2,Not recommended for self-respecting women.,"I was incredibly dissapointed with Chindi. I would have been able to overlook the slow plot if it had not been for the terrible character of Hutch. The female characters are so fake and seem so obviously written by a male. I was hoping that Hutch would be a strong female lead but as in all of Jack McDevitt's Hutch books, she was not. She is unbelievable and an incredibly poor depiction of women. I, myself, am not an extreme feminist but even so I was taken aback by her unrealistic and weak character. Other than this, the plot was drawn out and anticlimactic."
2,"An Interesting Idea, but a Dull Book","Jack McDevitt's new book, Chindi, starts out with an interesting idea. What would happen if a group of armchair adventurers hired a spaceship and made first contact with an alien civilization? The idea is intriguing but the author is unable to pull it off. The characters are caricatures, the pacing of the story is off, and the climax feels like a let down. After reading 400 pages I wanted some answers about who (or what) the aliens were. All that I got was a brief epilogue explaining that we still do not know what is going on. Where Jack McDevvit really shines is his ability to imagine grand astromonical settings for his story. His descriptions of the newly discovered planetary systems manage to evoke a sense of awe. Unfortunately this was not enough to hold my interest. Chindi is an interesting idea, but a dull book."
2,Boring--Nothing Really Happens,"I'd have to say there's something that kept me reading this book, but I kept asking myself why. I guess I was waiting for something to actually happen. It's just more of the same over and over. One thing I don't understand about some sci-fi writers such as McDevitt is if you're able to imagine distant planets and new species, how come you can't push your mind past ridiculous gender-role stereotypes? It is just stupid to think that all species are going to be males and females and that females will be smaller. This is just one example of the stupid lack of imagination in this book."
2,"More action, please.","Too many pages dedicated to character analysis and development, and when the action finally comes, it is at times murky and unclear. One example is the rescue of Tor from the doomed space shuttle. What should have been a quick and dirty rundown of a rescue just plodded on and on, and the characters weren't realistically reacting to a panic-inducing situation. I can't helpfully summarize what happened in the rescue because the scene was obtusely drawn and prone to lateral observations that just dragged the action down to grim entropic boredom.I read the book word-for-word to about halfway, and then after being let down by multiple mini-anti-climaxes, I had to skim. I found that you could skim 10-20 pages at a shot and not really miss much in the way of action or general plot. What then, fills these many pages? I don't know, don't really care, probably won't buy another McDevitt novel, and wouldn't recommend this to anyone but the dreadfully bored."
3,Nice try but...,"Basically a rehashing of the classic Rendezvous with Rama. Some interesting plot twists and ""hard"" science fiction in here, but overall any book that is written about searching for intelligent beings and never finding them is kind of like going out to the driving range and then skipping the round of golf. Cool cover though!"
2,"A rarity, a deeply mediocre McDevitt book","Continued reuse of the same rather wooden lead character cast a pall of boredom over the opening chapters for me, ""Hutch' is well past her sell by date and has hopefully now been pensioned off to well deserved obscurity. The book has it moments but struggles to rise above the quality of star trek's threadbare soap opera. The whole plot and especially the ending suffered from plodding predictability and lack of pzazz. Its all been done before with more style, better characters, and superior imagination."
5,Very Entertaining although somewhat constructed,"This is a great scifi story. Very entertaining, and a true page turner. When I finally finished it, it kept me up until 5am.The story is pretty well laid out and makes sense within the world constructed by McDevitt. However, there are some limitations as far as how ""realistic"" it is. People too easily take risks and enter alien worlds as casually as one would enter the public library.However, McDevitt sticks to the world he creates and is fairly consistant within it, which (if you can accept its ""cowboy"" nature), makes for an entertaining story.If you like scifi, you should enjoy this one!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is a Priscilla Hutchins novel. A weird communication is picked upin deep space. The people that want to go and investigate decide thatthey need a qualified pilot when they take their mission out.So, she takes the job, leaving her mundane commerce activities behind.We have an amateur research society and professional crew conflict,as well as investigating alien bits and pieces. All quite readable."
2,Exceptionally Annoying,"Many genre plots are driven by irresponsible and dangerous decisions on the part of the main characters. This seems more than usually the case in Chindi. I'm about 2/3 of the way through it, but don't think I can finish it. The ideas aren't very compelling, the most nearly appealing characters have mostly been killed off, and I wouldn't miss the others.Like an earlier reviewer, I generally like McDevitt. Hopefully his next outing won't feature a band of idiots repeatedly falling into tedious perils."
1,Science Fiction for the Hopelessly Mediocre,"Master of the bland SciFi, Mr. McDevitt writes a novel representing a juxtaposition to his futuristic without being futuristic Murder She Wrote embarassement called ""Infinity Beach"". Riddled with exotica called Canadians and Germans the best part in Chindi is when the major character, Star Trek wannabe, ""Hutch"" sits down and has a ""Blue Giraffe and a Melted Cheese"" for breakfast. Cheesy indeed."
1,Be careful with the back!,"Like all Little Tikes trucks this is well-made--but we have had the same problem as other parents with the dumping end flipping up and hitting our child in the face (and then the truck slipping out from under him) whenever he put weight on it! He received it for his first birthday and after a few injuries we put it away for over a year...we keep bringing it back out to try again, but at 2 1/2, this still happens occasionally. You can't go wrong with most Little Tikes trucks--but watch this one, especially with younger toddlers!"
5,It's more than a truck to him,"We bought this for $3 practically new at a yard sale over the summer and he loves this.Our son is now 20 mos and about 35 lbs and sits in it(barely), on it, climbs on it, keeps his hand tools in the dumper. He pushes it around in the living room on the hardwood floor and now learned to send it accross the room with a good push.He now loves to sit in the dumper and I push him around the room.This is a durable truck. It's not as big as the toughest Tonka's, but it's a good size. It is a durable plastic.I would recommend this for your 16 mos old and up"
4,Hidden Dangers,"My son loves his truck now that we have fixed the dump bed. The day it arrived he was pushing it around the house and the bed raised up and hit him in the mouth. Only a fat lip and a little bleeding, no major damage. I used a self tapping screw to attach the bed to the cab, and we haven't had any more problems with that part. Another problem we have had is with the tires. They don't stay on the hubs. It still works fine, but has to be fixed when he plays with the truck. He doesn't seem to care that it doesn't dump anymore, and he enjoys working on the tires."
2,Back of truck hits children in face,"When my son plays with his dump truck ,the back comes up & hits him in the face, because there is no way to latch it while kids are pushing it around."
1,Dump Truck,This truck was recommended by Oppenheim Portfolio but I don't agree with them. I purchased it for a 1 1/5 year old. He likes it but it doesn't work well - the back keeps popping back and is not much fun to play with.
2,Ouch,Everytime my little boy plays with this truck the dump part flips up and hits him in the face or it slides away from him on a smooth surface and he falls...it's fine outside or in the sand only.He really loves it - but ends up in tears everytime he plays with it - we have had to tape the dump part to the truck part and what fun is that?...
5,Fantastic,"This is just one fun toy. It doesn't have bunches of buttons or knobs. It is pure creativity, kid driven fun. It dumps and rolls and makes great tracks in the sand. It holds a lot of sand or other items. It is very sturdy and very easy to use.My one and only complaint is that this is fairly big and doesn't fit anywhere in our house with any ease. But if it were any smaller, it would not be as fun I think.If you look for toys that inspire creativity, exploration and play, this is a good toy to have. If you want a toy that is fairly quiet, has more than a button you push to make noise, and is easy to play with, this is a good toy to have.Enjoy."
3,A great toy until it falls apart,"We purchased this toy to replace the worn out one we bought for our oldest child 8 years ago only to discover that the quality is not the same as it used to be. When it was pushed by a 3 year old in the grass, it literally fell apart. The back tire fell off and left an exposed metal screw with the other wheel attached. I thought this was a coincidence and glued it together. Next the other wheel fell off. Needless to say it went into the garbage. Being a Little Tykes fan, I thought I had a lemon and purchased another one. I must be glutton for punishment as the back wheel fell off on the 3rd day during a playdate. What happened to good quality? A metal rod and a small child do not belong togther and why would a toy company screw a metal rod into a plastic wheel?"
5,A treasure trove of beautiful Unicorn artwork and more.,"Mr. Green has provided a sumptuous feast of color illustrations of the mystical Unicorn in a wide variety of settings, and with the accompanying original text, transports one's imagination to an enchanted, magical land. Though the editions of this book as of this writing are out of print, it is well worth the effort to locate a copy - I prefer the earlier edition where the illustrations were in their original smaller but more vivid appearance. A lovely book throughout."
3,Romance by a Historian's Daughter,"The king of the title is Edward I of England and the narrator is the youngest of his five daughters, Elizabeth, struggling in her unhappy arranged marriage to the Count of Holland while longing for a dashing English nobleman.As a girl of eleven or twelve, I loved Molly Haycraft's airy romances about royal women. Reading this book as an adult, however, I must say I found it a bit too insubstantial.While basically sweet and innocent in tone, the book does show the down side of princesshood, particularly the forced political marriages often devoid of love or even liking.Elizabeth is a likeable heroine, and if you're in the mood for something light and love reading about British royals, especially the Plantagenets, as I do, you'll probably enjoy this story.Want to read a really great book about Edward I and his family, by a natural storyteller who makes history come vividly alive? Read THE THREE EDWARDS by Thomas B. Costain (Molly Haycraft's father!)."
3,Ancient Egypt review,"The ""Spend the Day in Ancient Egypt Workbook"" is well written, and contains lots of interesting information. I used it to supplement the planned activities for a Vacation Bible School program based on ancient Egypt, and it was very helpful."
1,Review on product quality,"I have purchased used items before on Amazon.com and they have always been as described. Unfortunately not this time. This item was rated ""used - very good."" What I received did not come close to the description. 1-The case for the CD was scratched, dirty, and ""goo-ey."" 2-I had to clean the blood off the CD before using it. Yes blood.... I am a nurse and know blood when I see it. EEWW! 3-The CD has scratches on it. Fortunately it plays OK. If this is a ""used - very good"" I shudder to think what ""fair"" looks like. The description of this item left a lot to be desired."
5,xicar cutter,"This is the best cutter i've used so far. the bladdes are sharp and cuts cigars real crisp. recomend to anyone who is willing to pay a little extra for a cigar cutter. also has lifetime guarantee on blade sharpening. havent had to use it yet, but its nice to know."
5,Chewable tasty Calcium - and it's not GUMMY,"Why do the stores only carry gummy calcium supplements for kids?I was really happy to find this NON-GUMMY calcium supplement like this!My son loves this, and I like it, too."
2,Hit or miss,"This mainly flesh out the minor characters from the start of the series. Some of the jokes are great, some are a waste. If you're obsessed with the office, you might appreciate it; but I personally don't think its worth the money. These should ahave been extras on the regular season dvds. Last thing, its pretty annoying how they couldn't just edit the clips that make up the shorts to a solid single playing figurette. instead, every few minutes you have to sit through the little opening for the storyline over and over again"
4,office fan,"This was a very good collection of shorts... it was hilarious and not very expensive, so if you like all the characters in the office this is worth buying"
1,Not worthy.,"I am a die-hard fan, but this DVD is a total waste of money and time. The only redeeming features are the two music videos. However, a couple of minutes does not justify the $10 . . . That's what she said."
4,Don't remember watching this but...,..I want to get it off my reviews list. It's from the Office so I'm sure it is awesome. I LOVE the Office.
5,We were warned prior to 9/11,"We were warned about destruction of the WTC eight years in advance. This HBO documentary proves this (circa 1997). Many lies have been told to us from our government about 9/11.In the documentary the ""organizer"" of the 1993 WTC bombing, Ramsi Yusef, tells the FBI agent escorting him back to NYC that ""Next time we will take them BOTH down"". This documentary was shown on HBO almost daily up until the Sept 11, 2001 tragedy- BUT HAS NOT BEEN BROADCAST ONCE SINCE 9/11... Why is that? Why is HBO suppressing this powerful documentary? You must watch this!!!Let's petition HBO to rebroadcast the documentary."
5,Jihad,"The truth is stranger than fiction. If this doesn't make you think that all muslim's are extremists, don't read the newspaper."
5,good book.,"the detail in this book gives one goals to reach for , very impressive , and lots good ideas to look over."
5,Pyromania,"I'm not a big one on reviewing, but this is an excellent piece of work describing a relatively little known medium. I found the style of writing easy to read and very understandable. I also plan on trying most of the techniques described within. The book is profusely illustrated with examples of her work and also illustrative pictures. I learned much more than I knew about pyrography beforehand and was delighted to see that it falls well within the fine arts realm as opposed to just another craft. I highly recommend this to any beginner or old hand at pyrography. It includes a fine compilation of resources of further reading and finding materials."
5,Excellent Book,"This book is excellent for all levels of wood burners, beginner to expert. Highly recommended."
4,Woodburning vs. Gourdburning,"This book was excellent for woodburning, as the name implies. However, I was hoping for a little bit more information pertaining to gourdburning (if there is such a term!). Also, I wanted a little more detail for the different strokes, such as how the elephant skin was done. Overall, it was a very informative book - and I'm being a little toooo picky!"
4,"beautifull pictures, found hard for a beginner",Bout this together with a simple burner. It has very nice examples and aloot of information but it is not for beginners....
5,Pyrography,Great book for beginners and experts with many ideas and tips Highly recommend it to others
5,A great woodburning book.,My spouse asked for this book and I got it for a great price on Amazon. She loves it and is eager to try the techniques in it.
3,Pyrography Workbook - wood burning - FOR EXPERIENCED ONLY,"This book was too complicated for our 15 year old and not really useable with the cheap ineffective wood burning tool we bought here on Amazon. The tool broke within 30 minutes of using it and the book then became obsolete, so we retuned it. If you have the right tools and are experienced in this kind of art this book may be useful otherwise don't waste your money.There are those out there who spend more time judging the reviews of others. I made this review as a buyer and I stand by it. The book ""looks"" nice in content, but unless you have the skills in place to use a book of this caliber then it is a waste of money until you are more experienced and until you have the professional tools to accomplish the task."
4,Twelve Sharp,"Janet Evanovich continues to give us a fresher Stephanie Plum while keeping alive the things we love about that wacky Stephanie. I keep expecting for Evanovich's writing to get stale, but just the reverse is the case with Twelve Sharp - she's sharper than ever."
5,Couldn't put it down - as usual,"I always vow to wait until the books hit the library but can't help myself - bought it the first day it came out. Sat down and read it cover to cover in one day, what a guilty pleasure! I think this was one of the best and the picture of Lulu and Tank together = priceless! I can see why Stephanie has conflicting feelings for her men; I can't decide who I'm rooting for!"
2,Boring and not as much fun as the older books,"I absolutely agree with another reviewer, who said: ""There is no character growth, no resolution to Steph's confusion over which man to choose. What we do get is more confusion on Steph's part and her seemingly apparent denial that she is in fact cheating on the very man she claims to love. Why is this okay with so many readers?"" The Ranger/Morelli dilemma is tiring. The fact that she can't choose and occasionally cheats is annoying and definitely not okay with me as a reader. Grow up and settle down, Steph! Sure, Ranger may always be a distraction and an enigma, but choose and commit to Morelli. Stephanie managed to drive the same car throughout the entire book. That's a first! Also, not enough Grandma Mazur. The whole thing with the band seemed forced. Still fun, but not worth the wait."
5,Hilarious!,"Janet Evanovich never disappoints...She is the only author that I read that I laugh out loud with. She did it again with Twelve Sharp. It was a great book and for those who didn't like it, you have no sense of humor... It was great and she continually makes the best read in town!!!"
3,This one not as good as some of the others,"I've read almost all the Plum series and some, as can be expected, are better than others. I didn't like the dual Ranger deal in this one. It just didn't seem plausible to me. I also didn't like him moving in on Stephanie, sleeping in her bed, even! after she told him no. He touches her too much, especially knowing that she's another guy's girl!Lula is pretty goofy, but I still like her. I hope Melvin Pickle continues as a character in the next book. Oh, and the agent planted in the bonds office was way too predictable."
3,A good read but not her best work,"I just discovered this series about a month ago and have read all 12 books now. In my opinion, this one wasn't her best. I enjoyed the emotional plot of Ranger's daughter and I did enjoy seeing a another side of the elusive Ranger. However, the Ranger-Morelli situation has gotten boring. Morelli is starting to look like a fool. I get annoyed with her kissing and flirting with Ranger when she calls Morelli ""her boyfriend"". It's starting to feel alot like cheating to me. I think its time to give Morelli a woman to flirt with him and give Stephanie a run for her money! Also, I felt the book was a little short and definately short on the sex! 12 Sharp was the least sexy of the whole series. Janet needs to spice it back up with Stephanie and Joe!!"
4,Steph's back!,"For a while the Plum series languished in the same old same old rut. In Twelve Sharp, Stephanie's got her groove back. The tension between Ranger and Stephanie, Morelli and Stephanie, and Morelli and Ranger quivers without declining into cliche, and Steph herself is learning to live with the ambiguity of it all. What is troublesome is that she seems to be unable to make a decision and stick with it, unless it has to do with food. This girl needs to move on and make a life for herself! But Twelve's plot is nice and tight, somewhat darker than usual, and doesn't resort to easy or incredible solutions. The colorful stock characters are reliable as always, and the slapstick passages, especially those involving Lula, Grandma, and the funeral home are over the top. It's enough to make you want to visit Trenton (well, almost).Some classify the Plum series as chick lit, but I think it's entertaining enough and real enough for readers of mystery in general."
3,"She blew up a car, but at least it wasn't her own this time","For me, the Stephanie Plum books are like junk food for the brain; they're good in a bad sort of way and you want to devour them in one sitting. This one didn't disappoint, but after 12 books I was kind of hoping for a little more growth from my favorite bounty hunter. She's only slightly less inept than she was the first time she set out to nab her first ""FTA"", still can't choose between Ranger and Morelli (oh to have such a problem!) and still gets into more trouble in one book than most people see in a lifetime. However, if she were any more stable and skilled, she just wouldn't be Stephanie Plum."
4,Loads of fun,"I love the Stephanie Plum books they are fun with just enough suspene to maket them a true delight. Janet Evanovich is an excellent writer, I would recommend her books to anyone. I love Amazon and ease of buying and receiving a Kindle book."
5,Twelve Sharp,"The ""Plum"" family is one to get to know and then you will love their ""down to earth"" tales. Especially the grandmother and the respect they give her and she is so active - yet naive."
4,REALLY 5-STARS -- SURELY WORTH THE READ,"Stephanie Plum has two men in her life -- Ranger and Joe. In Book 1, Joe is on the lam, in Book 12, it is Ranger.Both are macho hunk, both make her melt, both are the light of her life. But, Ranger is self described as the ""dessert"" in her food pyramid -- which he believes to depict a fun romp but not for the long haul. But, what he does not know is that dessert is her food pramid.Joe, is the guy who goes to her house every Friday for dinner and then for his ability to tolerate the banter, gets his own just desserts from Stephanie.Enjoyable and playful characters of the Burg, these books grow and grow and grow on you. There are times that you will find yourself in stitches (the scene of interviewing the prospective new bounty hunters is amazingly tight and funny).If you pick this book up -- I will almost guarantee you that you will finish it within hours."
4,The Love Triangle HAS to go.,"I read all of the Stephanie Plum novels in a month and cannot wait book 13 (which I would love to be named Lucky 13)! The Ranger, Stephanie, Morelli trianlge is KILLING me!The plot line in this book was the best yet. It moved along quickly and I was so enthralled I didn't even feel the need to guess what would happen next. The quirky characters just add more flavor and depth to this already terrific read."
4,Perfectly Plummed,"I am so happy to be enjoying a Stephanie plum novel again. I had to take a break, finding the sexual tension repetitive and the plot mediocre. Twelve Sharp, a best buy at $2.99, is razor sharp. I am enjoying the dialogue, Stephanie's love dilemma, her zany work environment, and the mystery, growing deliciously darker and darker. Janet E has done a great job on this one. Tara, author of Gypsies' Passion."
2,Twelve Dull,"I'm suprised so many reviews of this book are superb. If you did not read the previous 11 books, I could understand one enjoying the book. However, the storyline just was not believable based on the development of Ranger's character in the previous books. There's just now way the identify theat/daughter plot would ever have happened to Ranger. It's like a different author wrote the book. Also, a mistake worth noting: Stephanie lives in an apartment. Twelve Sharp refers to her residence as an apartment at the beginning, condo in the middle, and back to an apartment at the end. Details matter."
2,Okay But Not Great,"Basically this was not her best effort. In the predictable column, Stephanie sleeps with Joe and lusts after Ranger. Grandma does her deal and sister is pretty much absent. Her car doesn't get blown up and someone new is running the funeral home. I did read it in one night as I love her work, but I didn't get the thrill I usually get from Stephanie Plum. I also thought it very strange that all of a sudden, there is this Ranger stalked who knows all about him, has been following him and Ranger doesn't have a clue? Excuse me, that is not the Ranger of any of the other books. 11 previous books make him the super competent, enigmatic character that no one can trace and now all of a sudden, this store clerk has been stalking him for months and he didn't know that they guy was screwing with his life, his credit, his name and kidnapping his kid? I don't expect these to be plausible, but at least be consistent. I was disappointed."
1,very disappointing,"I didn't mind that the books were getting shorter and shorter. Nor did I mind the thin plots or the weakening characterizations.But what I do mind is that I didn't laugh out loud once while reading ""Twelve Sharp"". That's what kept me reading these books. Please, Janet, how about slowing down?!?"
3,Good but not her best,"I look forward to the ""Plum"" books every summer. I found this an easy and ejoyable read but not as funny as her previous books. I'm also wondering how long Evanovich will drag the triangle out. There are way too many mixed feelings between the characters to make this series enjoyable much longer. I'd like to see this series resolve itself and the author try something else."
2,Not much of a story,"Lots of sexual overtones between Stephanie and Ranger and her long-time boy friend Morelli, but the underlying story is very thin. Reasonably good read, but easy to put down and pick it up later. Several of the main characters seem out of place (Lulu and Sally) in Trenton, NJ and the Bail Bond business."
1,Downward spiral continues,"After being delighted by the first six or seven books in this series, I noticed a big dropoff with book eight. It's no coincidence that Hard Eight is the novel where Stephanie cheats on Morelli with Ranger. And feels little or no guilt. She lost much of her charm in that book, and her continual string-pulling in the subsequent books does nothing to redeem her. I suspect that Evanovich decided her core audience is female, and chose to indulge a favorite female fantasy: two studs battling for Stephanie, and Stephanie doing pretty much whatever she wants, with no consequences. The ""shake my head in disbelief"" point for me in Twelve Sharp came when Morelli discovers Ranger is living with Stephanie in her apartment, closes the door, and meekly walks away. Right. That might be a female fantasy, but as a male reader, it is totally unbelievable ... unless you accept Morelli as a wimp, in which case, why care about him?"
5,Vintage Plum,"Is it funny? Yes.Does it have a lot of romantic tension? Yes.Does it have a good villain? Yes.Is the mystery interesting? Yes.Are the characters still fun? Yes.What more do you want out of a summer beach book?I've heard some reviewers bemoan Ms. Plum's lack of dynamic character development throughout the series. They would like to see Stephanie grow, or change, or mature, or develop, or choose between Ranger and Joe, or become a monk and move to Tibet, or join the Galactic Alliance and fight the Mucus Monsters of Planet Nostril.I disagree. I think the formula is perfect. It's fun, fast-paced, and always good for some laughs.You wouldn't ask Walt Disney to make Mickey Mouse more grown-up. Especially since Disney has been dead for several decades.You shouldn't ask Janet Evanovich to change Stephanie, either. Both Stephanie, and Janet, are perfect the way they are, and I hope they stay that way for many more books."
3,sub-par,"This 12th edition of the often hilarious Plum exploits, was simply not as strong as prior efforts by the very capable Janet E. The dinner scenes at Stephanie's parents have become predictable, her infatuation with Ranger is becoming a sophmoric fantasy. The constant carnage thrust upon Plum is becoming predictable as well. I read the book in one sitting as is my habit, I was entertained but only mildly. I felt as if Janet E. had a deadline and rushed to meet it. She left out her sister and her sisters neurotic lawyer husband who are generally good for a few laughs. Her interaction with her hamster and her eating habits need to be notched up to a more sophisticated level. I will buy the next Plum novel, I only hope Janet E. puts a little more punch into it."
4,Keep the triangle,"After reading most of the other reviews I would disagree about letting the Steph, Morelli, Ranger triangle resolve itself. Once it's over and Steph chooses, say, Morelli, then what. Ranger pratically said he was attached to her, and Morelli has said he loves her, so what's a girl to do? I would let the triangle go until the end of the series, when the choice is going to be obvious. Ranger and Steph will always have a connection some how, and it's going to be tricky to make the end of the relationship satisfying to us readers.My only complaint is it seems as if another person wrote other than Janet wrote part of the book. It didn't have the same flow and feel of the others. I only laughed out loud once."
2,Annoying Audio Version,"I was used to the former audio voice, which was fantastic, with perfect timing that added to the humor and had great character renditions. This new audio voice is so ANNOYING and not even in the same league as the former one."
5,#12 Loved It,I loved this book. I only wish there was a car bombed or something. I did enjoy learning alot more about Rangers life. I think the shooting got Stephanie thinking.....
3,Good but Oh the ending....,"I love this series! I wait with anticipation for the next book the moment I finish reading the current one however the ending to this one was less than desirable. It's not that I think the triangle is getting old it just fell flat at the end.People want to say Steph is cheating which hey she might be but this is fiction an escape a drama if you will, and it's exciting. I love Ranger I just cannot help myself. However, I thought more could have happened with her and Ranger or her and Morelli yet nothing. And as for the end to this novel it does not compare to her others. There needed to be a couple more pages of something especially after the BANG! events leading to the end.However, I will give it three stars because it was not a waste of time and the middle and beginning were filled with fast reading just someone help the end!"
2,"Entertaining, BUT...","Eh...I read this on my mom's referral and while it was entertaining and fast-paced, I wasn't enthralled by it. As I think about it, there were some fun characters and they were the high point (Lula and Ranger, specifically). I think my major issue with this book was Stephanie! I know everyone loves her, but I thought she was annoying and kind of pretentious. It was a fun romp through the underbelly of Jersey's ""FTAs"" as Plum calls them, but I probably won't be reading any other Evanovich books...but I see why people like them."
3,Not as Pleased as with all the Others,"i found this book to not be as fast or funny as the previous Stephanie Plum books. It felt rushed and unfulfilling to me. I thought the characters were not fleshed out(new ones) or given as much time as before, especially the grandmother(she is extremely funny, ordinarily). Other than that it felt hurried, it was still worth reading and is a further step in Stephanie's life."
3,Getting tired of the format,"Although I'm a huge fan of this series, they are become toorepetitive. Also, we can't continue to have the frictionbetween 2 men and 1 women. Something new would be nice.Best part... the NJ jokes!"
5,The best in a long time!,"By far, imho, the best SP novel to date- Stephanie is bright, funny and witty- and Ranger is brought out even more- he becomes an even more suitable suitor for Stephanie. Morelli is not quite as ""active"" in this one- but his parts (!) are great too. I agree with a previous poster - I am grateful for not so-over-the-top villans, and don't mind the (slightly) more serious tone.This is really the best one I have read- and how I wish there was another one NOW!"
2,This Book Was Phoned In,I have anticipated this book for months. Start reading and Stephanie is a bounty hunter again. What happened to working for Ranger at the end of the last book? Have to wait until halfway through and there was one sentence - I worked for Ranger once - but no explanation of why she wasn't any longer or how she got back into the bail bonds business. Really missing the depth of the other books. Not as funny at all.
5,Lean Mean Thirteen,"My biggest problem with the Stephanie Plum books is waiting for the next one to come!! Loved this. Anything that has more of Ranger is better. Morrelli is great but, OH OH Ranger. The usual characters are their usual selves ~ a riot! I didn't miss her sisters bunch at all. Stephanie is getting to be better at bounty hunting, as she should, but still very fragile in appropriate ways. Bring on the next!"
5,"Good, butt.....","This one,just seemed to be lacking something. But, it was still hilarious and kept me reading. Time to delve into the next big adventure."
4,"Better, but still drawn out. . .","I stopped reading these books after 7. The whole love triangle thing was getting too stupid for me. No man I know would stick around waiting for her dumb butt to make up her mind who she wants, especially two strong alpha types. Yet, my book group kept raving and raving about these books, so I picked up 12 Sharp and re-read the series.This is the best one in awhile, loved her secondary charecters, but I still don't have the patience to sit and wait for who she is going to choose. And, it's annoying that she isn't more competent and a bounty hunter by now. Will I keep reading the series, probably, but I won't by anymore. I will read them at the library."
4,4 1/2 Stars on Audio,Another hilarious audio book with great narration and voices byLorelei King.Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels are a hoot!A good break from the thrillers I usually read.Highly recommended.
5,Excellent Book,"This was an excellent book, very exciting, funny, and sexy. I have read all of the books in this series and am very anxious for her next book.A definate must read!!!"
3,Did anyone else notice....,"That the margins for this book were large? As a librarian I tend to notice these things and the margins for Twelve Sharp seem abnormally large. Like the book really wasn't that long, but by putting in larger margins it made the book SEEM longer. As for the story, I did like it. I use to have issues with how poor of a bounty hunter Stephanie is, and always had to have the guys help out. Is this a good image for women? But she actually was better at her job in this one. The writing was better than some others. And I prefer Ranger over Morelli, but I agree the love triangle is played out - pick one and stick with it."
2,So disappointing!,"I devour each Stephanie Plum novel and this one was no exception. I agree with other reviewers that there were no LOL moments and it seemed to be formulaic. I was so disappointed in Ranger's portrayal in this book. Where was the man of mystery? The classy, mysterious, elusive man? He was written like his character in the first novel... street. And this copycat Ranger! Puhleese! He studies Ranger w/o Ranger knowing, Ranger admits he's good and he comes off in the end reminding me of Albert Kloughn. BTW, where were Valerie and Albert? The book felt forced to me, not many details, no character growth... Yawn. I'll still be ""Team Ranger"" and will try to block this book out of my fantasies. LOL"
5,twelve sharp,"I loved it, it was really entertaining and uplifting.I laughed so hard tears were coming to my eyes.I was in thedoctor's office and an assistant came to see if I was ok.I was more than ok, I was delighted with this book. I loveRanger and Jo, Janet makes them so yummy! I read it in oneday I probably should have restrained myself but why when youare having fun. I passed the book along to my girls. Can hardlywait for the next one. I may reread it just for the joy of it."
2,Twelve Sharp was too little too late,"I was disappointed in this Stephanie Plum book, and after a long wait and as a fan of Plum, I felt like it was too little too late. There was not much mystery, the comedy seemed contrived (the job applicants) and stale (the rehearsal) and I agree with a previous reviewer, it is time Stephanie grew up and made a decision about her love life. I like Sally Sweet and I love Lula, but the only place any of these people seem to go on a daily basis is the shopping mall, Vinnie's office, to the Plum's for dinner, or the funeral home, which is becoming timeworn. I wonder if the author isn't spreading herself too thin. I get the impression that she is tired of Stephanie Plum."
3,When will Joe get to be the Hero?,"I enjoy the Stephanie Plum novels. They are fast and fun reads. But, one qustion, when will Joe get to be the Hero? Book after book, it is Ranger who saves the day or to whom Stephanie runs for help. And in the last several books, Joe's character has been put on the backburner. It's time to heat him up again! I really hope that the next time around the author will give Joe the storyline he deserves. And let him save the day for once!"
4,Plum Withdrawals Already!!!,"I absolutely LOOOOVEE the Plum series. I've been waiting for 12 for what seems like forever! My only complaint is that it was over much too soon. I need at least 450 pages if you're going to make us wait so long Janet. Several laugh out loud moments, this book (like all of them) is hilarious. I'm sure the people on my commuter bus thought I was nuts. I do agree with some of the other comments that the Ranger/Joe thing MUST be resolved in the next book, it's gone on long enough. I personally think Steph should get her rocks off one last time with Ranger and then commit to Joe. May Joe could find out about it later which could make for interesting reading. The bit on Lula and Tank was great. I missed Valerie and Albert though. Don't keep us waiting so long for 13 Janet, I beg you. We love Stephanie!"
4,Four star review,"I love Stephanie Plum books and this, although not the best out of the 12, was very good. I love Grandma, especially when she goes to the funerals and this time, joining the rock band!! Lulu is up to her spunky self, Stephanie's father made me laugh, and Ranger and Morelli are still competing. Hopefully there will be more books soon in this series to read. Janet Evanovich is one of the best!!"
3,"Slow down, you are moving too fast","Poor value for the money. While other best sellers are told in 6 CDs, this quickly written Plum story fits on 3. Please, please go back to Ms. Petty reading. This reader identifies that voice to the story."
1,Kindle Strikes Again,"A friend gave me a copy of Lean Mean Thirteen which is a chuckle a minute. It is a light hearted and fun read. I am exploring Evanovich books now having enjoyed this one so much. However, I want to take them in my Kindle and again, the price is higher than the paperback. This is just silly. Would I suggest that anyone buy an e-reader? Nope! I am so very disappointed. I can almost see the same price but higher when we can't even share the silly book with a friend. No indeed. I will check the bargain bins. Never mind Kindle books."
1,really?,"OK - maybe I have read them too fast?? I just started reading this series and have read up through 9 all the way. Was so disappointed with 10, 11, and 12 that I sent them back and requested a refund. Maybe I'm the dumb one since I kept reading them who knows... I read them in the span of a week and a 1/2 and maybe I should have put more time between the books maybe so I didn't lose interest? I don't know. This one was just ..... irritating is the only word I can come up with. OMG why is she letting another man feel her up? Why is someone with a missing child in the frame of mind to WANT to feel someone up? Why is someone that is constantly shot at afraid to carry a gun? Why has Stephanie NOT figured out she might want a cheap junk car for work and a nice car for when she isn't working so her nice cars quit getting blown up? Lula is SO SO SO SO annoying! If the bond office hired Melvin what do they need Lula for?? I have stopped reading the series for now."
2,Twelve Sharp,"I really, really, really love the Stephanie Plum series. And I love Janet's other series as well. I really disliked this book. I felt the whole time I was reading it that Janet is just pushing out another book because we fans are waiting for more.I did not find the characters to be very likable and was getting really tired of Ranger putting his hands under Stephanie's shirt every time he got with in 20 feet of her. Maybe it is time Stephanie stops mooning over a guy that she knows is not going to commit or stop stringing Joe along.I was really saddened that all they could think about was sex when a little girl was in such danger.Maybe if Janet can't do better than this, and I really am hoping that she can, it is time to end the seies. I will read number 13 when it comes out, but I am not sure if I will be in such a rush. Let's all hope that Janet gets these wonderful characters back for us."
2,"Trashy, trashy, trashy","I started out as big fan of this series but I've watched it deteriorate with every new edition. These books are no longer humorous, they're crude and vulgar. I won't be buying another and I'm sad that what was once a clever and well-written mystery series has become schlock."
2,"Stephanie Plum, Make up your mind already!","I've loved every book in the Stephanie Plum series, but this one lost my interest. I'm sick of reading over and over again how much Stephanie loves Morelli and how much Stephanie loves Ranger. Who cares. She needs to just make up her mind. Or give up men and become a lesbian. Anything is better than more whining about how she loves both guys and can't decide.I'm totally over it.Of course, Grandma and Lula are still totally funny."
2,Left Me Wanting More,"I am a fan of the series and was quite disappointed with 12 Sharp. I think Ranger was weak/not on his game, Stephanie is getting too old to not change/make a decision about Joe/Ranger, and, for goodness sake, Rex cannot still be alive. All of the pages spent on interviewing the new candidates for bounty hunter were not funny at all.There needs to be some more character development or at least progress in Stephanie's character development.It felt like a ghost writer just took the ""Evanovich Formula"" and wrote this from an outline."
3,Not Janet's best work,"I have enjoyed all of the Plum Series and I just felt like this one was a little weak. I had a hard time getting into this one, thank god it picked up in the end."
4,Stephanie Plum Novel,"I was so excited about this book, I read it in one night. I was a little disappointed that no cars were blown up in the writing of this book (ha), but otherwise, I enjoyed the humor, suspense and mixed up romance always found in her novels. I can't wait for 13!!!"
5,Just Plum Good Fun!!,"Stephanie is at it again! Blowing up cars, confused between two men, funeral parlor mayhem and don't forget the donuts!In this latest installment you find Stephanie help track the kidnapped daughter of Ranger. There are very real scenes of danger and the book is actually a little darker when Stephanie rushes in to help rescue Ranger's daughter. But don't worry we got Lula, Tank, a suicidal shoe salesman turn file clerk and grandma is joining a rock band! Stephanie fans won't be disappointed."
5,Evanovich Does it Again!,"I have eagerly awaited this latest installment in Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum mysteries. All my favorite characters were there: Stephanie, Grandma Mazur, Lula, Joe, and hunky, mysterious Ranger. As usual there were lots of humor and suspense. My only disappointment is that the books are just too darn short!"
5,12 Sharp,"Even though this story was humerous (as are all the Stephanie Plum stories), 12 Sharp had more depth. It was really interesting to see a deeper side of Ranger. Stephanie is caught in a love-triangle between her, Ranger and Joe; I wish she would make up her mind either to love one and leave the other, or play the field."
3,Escape Reality,"A fun, fast read from Evanovich but not her best book. The main characters had me laughing out loud in parts (the italian stallion eyeing off cookies) but the minor characters are becoming too silly, too unrealistic. Who goes around telling everyone there a pervert? The most interesting parts of the book were learning more about Ranger's life. This is definitely a book to read to escape reality."
2,Please don't ruin it for us,To reviewers:Please consider not telling important plot details (Ranger's wife) for those of us who haven't read it yet. Now it will be no surprise for us.Thanks
2,Disappointed Plum fan,"I am a huge Plum fan and eagerly await the new release each June, but I was really disappointed this time. It was an ok book, but not up to Janet's usual standards. Where were the laugh out loud until you cry moments? Where were the other story lines that go on within the story as in previous books? The characters of Ranger and Morelli didnt even seem like they were written by Janet, in fact alot of the book didnt have the Janet ""feel"". It seemed to me Janet was bored and just wanted to put something out there. I will buy 13 when it comes out and keep my fingers crossed that her writers block or boredom is gone by then."
5,Ranger or Morelli,"I have loved all the books in the series! So far, my favorite was ""Hard Eight"" - appropriate since it contained that infamous hook up. Ranger-Morelli...hmmmm. Sometimes you just HAVE to have the dessert and not leave any evidence because it makes you just smile! Joe is the safe choice and I am sure Ranger is aware of the effect he has on Steph - I know I am. I love the tension when she and Ranger are alone; I have to give her credit for her willpower. Don't get me wrong, I do like her with Joe and she will probably end up with him for the long haul...but Ranger - some things need no explanation, just action."
1,Too Crude,I usually enjoy listening to a Stephanie Plum story on CD while I am driving around town. This one seemed to be just too crude for me to actually enjoy. I finally decided that I couldn't hear about the dildos and the sex any longer and gave it back unfinished. I enjoyed the Plum Lovin' story I got as well but Twelve Sharp was just too much.
4,Plum Fun - A Great Summer Read,"I've read Evanovich since her first Stephanie Plum book and, as often happens, the series felt like it was fading around #8. Now I'm pleased to see that Evanovich has managed to revive her characters and bring in a great addition to Vinnie's office staff- a guy who has jumped bond, but is likeable and efficient with filing. The Ranger/Morrelli tension is predictable, the plot of the kidnap a bit thin, but you will get a great laugh out of the scenes with Grandma Mazur, Lulu and Sally playing in a rock band to ""sold out"" senior citizen centers. Certainly worth your money."
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun",Just so much fun...When will this series be made into a film? Truly a summer highlight!
5,Excellent!,One of my favorite parts of the Stephanie Plum novels has been the Ranger-Stephanie-Morelli triangle. In Twelve Sharp we finally get more Ranger! I loved it!!!
4,a fun and easy read....,"I really enjoyed this book, however I don't think it was as good as some of her others, I still enjoyed it. I was a little disappointed by the ending, but I am looking forward to seeing how she starts book 13."
5,Great book,"I got this on my ipad and enjoyed it from beginning to end. Love these plum stories, can't wait to read the next one!"
3,Not as exciting as the other series,"I was a little disappointed by this new Stephanie Plum novel. The other previous novels were very exciting and entertaining. They had me on the floor dying of laughter but this one was so so in my opinion. Maybe its just me and the fact that I went from reading a book religiously to only once or twice a year, but don't get me wrong it was good but not like the previous ones. I was kinda hoping that Stephanie and Ranger would hook again and she would leave Joe in the dirt."
3,Usual fare. Maybe a little too formulaic...,"Is it just me or is the ""should I choose Morelli or Ranger"" subplot getting old and tiresome and BORING? Still worth reading but no real surprises or deviations from past books. I didn't read any LOL scenarios and I'm over the love triangle so I rated it at just three stars."
3,When is enough ENOUGH?,"Ms. Evanovich surely created an endearing character with Stehpanie Plum, Bounty Hunter Extraordinaire. However, there is no place left for Stephanie to go. Her track record of disasters occurring while working at her dubious job has pretty much been worn out. Her relationships with the enigmatic Ranger and the dangerously attractive Morelli do not seem to change from book to book. If she can't make up her mind, perhaps it's time to find a new and entirely different lover. At any rate, Stephanie has run the gamut, in my opinion, and it is time for her to be retired. Ms. Evanovich is a clever writer but it is obvious, especially to the constant reader, that each book has become a bit more risque and this one has crossed the line. Maybe this is supposed to give the story a wider appeal. I find it a turn-off. People I know, who read this author, are well-educated, upper middle- class white women. And Ms. Evanovich is losing them."
5,I love Stephanie Plum's adventures.,"Janet Evanovich certainly has a way with words. Here is book #12 of the Stephanie Plum series, and I'm still intrigued with them. I have a hard time finishing ""enough"" before going to bed every night. I don't want to put it down."
3,Pale rendition,The music is beautiful and the exquisite understanding of Mozart by Richter resounds through the poor recording quality. I can only imagine what brillance the live audience saw! The CD was well-priced and has definite value.
4,First time user,"As a first time user, it took awhile to get use to the size. Now, I'm use to it && love it. Upon taking it out the packet, the smell was kinda strong. But I wash it with soap and water before every use, so that's not really a problem."
3,OK follow up....,"I didn't feel that this had as much impact on me as the first one. I was a high school athletes when the first one was made, so I felt a sense of connection to Arthur Agee & William Gates. This go-around, I would have liked to see more of where life took the both of them after their dreams were deferred. I would have, at least, liked to see something on Gates, being as though he is now a minister, though it is good to see that Agee now owns the Hoop Dreams brand. At least one of them was able to profit from this.Being a grown man, now, I see this from older eyes. I would have hoped for the young ball player, Patrick Beverly, to have learned from the wisdom Agee was trying to pass down to him & the mistakes that held him back. Unfortunately, he didn't finish school, had kids early, and blah blah blah. Let's hope that he makes good on his talent, and if not, that he picks up other life skills to carry him and his family forward."
2,Not as good as the original,"This is worth a look to see how Arthur is doing, but it would have been better if William Gates had been included. The story is not as compelling as the orginal."
2,Definitely not a sequel,"No need for me to go into depth on a story summary here, but I will say that the production values in this are pretty low and parts of it look as though they were shot on a low-end Handycam. Arthur Agee's involvement seems to be sporadic in parts. He's heavily featured through about the first half and the the second half he sort of disappears. Is he the narrator or a featured personality? The producers can't seem to decide."
2,Too broad,"I expected a book on supercharging in particular. Instead I have a book on engine tuning which is a complete redundancy in my opinion. Some of the items covered- fuel, intake ignition just to name a few. Barely covered are all the forced inducing systems. Its too broad. Barely covers any supercharger although has good graphs and formulaes for blowers and intercoolers.If you have no knowledge of engines and wish to ""force induce"" your engine this book may be good for you. But if you have no knowledge of engines you shouldn't even be doing this in the first place! Its not enough to teach engine theory and is not enough to teach forced induction systems. I wasted bucks on duplicity and now have to buy a book that deals with SUPERCHARGING! Not how to tune an engine!"
5,"Forced induction made easy, but not too easy",This a fantastic book and is laid out so if you only have basic knowledge on engines you will understand the content easily. I have picked up so much from this book and it is technical enough to grasp essential knowledge when dealing with forced induction and includes the formulas needed to calculate the factors that make the difference for optimal performance. Many examples of theory are represented by well known vehicles and engines produced in the past. It is not just factual it is interesting to read due to the historical content.
2,"Interesting photos, art is not always comfy living...","Striking photographs of interiors, few would want to live inside. These are eclectic photos of intriguing items with no thought to function or comfort. For example, throwing a sofa, a huge piece of art and neon sign with nothing else and a house full of such rooms implies the rooms are for a gallery and not for living, sleeping, working or interacting. These are not added to with any advice for decorating or informative data about the items either. For instance, I love a chair inside but it's described as ""antique chair"". How is that going to help me find one like it? This is a coffee table book, not a how-to book at all."
4,Good Stuff!,"This is a great Jumpdrive. I bought it a while after I lost my Jumpdrive Traveller. This is more durable, fits more information, and is about the same price on Amazon. The clip on top is very convenient, and it is smaller, which allows it to fit on my laptop.My only gripe is the fact that to remove the whole sleeve around it (It looked like just a cap) can be a bit of a pain.But, besides that, this is a great prodect. Buy it."
1,Poor support,"I didn't have the same experience as the ""Great support from Lexar"" review below.The rubber caps on the Sport Jumpdrives will quickly split open and you will probably loose your jumpdrive when it falls off your keychain.Unlike the person below, Lexar would not send me a free replacement. They said that I could go to their web site an purchase another rubber cap.Poor support for a poor product!"
2,Don't count on Lexar rebates,"I purchased a jumpdrive from Lexar. One of the biggest enticements was a $20.00 rebate. I sent everything in as requested about 6 weeks ago. Today I got a postcard asking me to confirm the information on the submittal. I called them, did so, as was informed that the check will be mailed out to me in about 8 weeks. PNT Technologies has a similar unit which I bought for my son. His rebate check arrived within two weeks. You won't see me purchasing from LEXAR again. Two stars 'cause the unit works."
5,The little things that count........,"I will never buy any other brand or type of jump drive and I hope Lexar never changes the particular feature that I find most appealing. The snap over rubber cover on my 512Mb Jump Drive is the best. I recently and by accident, left my jump drive in a shirt pocket. The shirt, along with the jump drive spent 45 minutes splashing around inside a washing machine, and another 45 minutes tumbling around in a warm dryer before my wife discovered it at the bottom of the drum. Guess what? It still works! I highly recommend this product! Thank you Lexar, someone in you design department deserves a bonus!"
4,"Great little drive, one small problem","I just bought this 64mb Jumpdrive Sport the other day, and so far I love it--except for one thing that needs to be pointed out: if you are going to be copying or saving files that contain slashes (like / or \ ) be aware the the Jumpdrive does not support those characters, and will abort the transfer.It took me a few tries to figure out that this was the problem, as I am using this particular USB drive to back up a plethora of documents. I use OS X, and while copying I got the message ""Document filename is too long or contains unsupported characters"" and instead of just skipping the bad file, it would abort the whole process. After I changed a few filenames (for instance, my Address Book backup file, which uses the date, with slashes, in the filename), it worked just fine.Just a heads up. Otherwise, a nifty and affordable tool."
2,"""Case"" is really annoying","The drive itself is great, the problem is that the rubber ""Case"" is hard to get off at first and annoying from that point on. Sure theres no way you'll lose the drive but I've never have a problem with the regular caps on the drives I've purchased since then."
2,Having Problems Already,I have had it less than a month and already I have issues. The drive will not let me fill it to capacity. I keep getting an error and I still have over 100mbs of space left.
3,Has problems with Dell Computers,"be forewarned that XP operating systems on Dell do not always recognize this device in the front USB port. According to people on the Dell site, if you update the XP drivers you will be able to use it. Otherwise, not a bad device."
2,Worked perfect until it died,"I used mine about 20-25 times over the course of the first 45 days I had it. I loved the convenience and mobility. Everything worked great and I was about to order another one for my Dad as a gift.Then it suddenly stopped being recognized by any of my machines. They just saw it as an unformatted generic USB storage device instead of recognizing it as a Jumpdrive Sport as they had before. It could not be formatted and Lexar's lacking tech support offered no assistance. Perhaps I just got a bad one, but I'm seeing that this is pretty common. They either work or they don't and there is no warning that they are about to stop working.I'll send it in for warranty replacement at my expense. I would recommend that you DO NOT use it for permanent storage of anything."
3,Who does this guy's proofreading?,"I thought that this book served as a good introduction to the topics addressed. I would have preferred more depth, less breadth, but it is an introduction. Different ideas on justification, predestination, and the Lord's Supper were discussed in an accessible way. I particularly benefited from seeing the opinions of less-well known reformers, as well as getting historical and social background. The main detraction from this work was the prevalence of typographical errors. It was difficult to take McGrath's academic opinions seriously when there were spelling errors on every other page! If this bothers you, look for an updated edition."
4,Reading English,"Often, those who do not know the difference in the way certain words are spelled in English in the UK and the US assume that there are typos and poor editing. If that is the case in these ""reviews"" then a bit more education is needed on the part of the reviewers. If indeed there are errors on every other page, kindly address those to Blackwell. They, no doubt, will be happy to know of them, and perhaps provide the attentive reviewer with a complimentary copy of the corrected version, or perhaps a link to where they can buy an English Dictionary, UK version."
5,Best show going,"The acting is great, the stories are well written. This is a relatively clean show (cuss words sometimes), and the characters are loveable. I would recommend this DVD series to someone who just wants to have a little entertainment and down time without being insulted by gross humor. The price is great as well."
5,How can you not love Monk?,"Tony Shalhoub plays a likable role as a former police detective (and current for-hire detective) in San Fransisco, while portraying his struggles with OCD in daily life. Just a great show! Family friendly (for the most part - no nudity, inappropriate language, offensive material, just the occasional ""murder""), and a series both my husband and I love to watch! You can seriously waste a whole weekend plopped on the sofa watching this DVD series (though is it really a waste to watch Monk?..I don't think so!)"
5,Inspirational,"I'm directing a production of Clive Barker's The History of the Devil, and this is an endless source of inspiration. Clive Barker actually used this book when writing the play."
4,This is a very good beginner's book,"I think this is an outstanding book for people starting out to build their own southwestern style furniture. The projects and techniques outlined in this book are very basic but useful.This book would have rated higher than a 7 in my book if it had more advanced information, particularly more advanced projects and techniques such as advanced carving techniques.IMHO it's definitely worth the money if you're starting to dabble in Southwestern style furniture"
5,cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool,coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
4,class use,i used this movie as a way for my students to analyze human manipulation and it's affects. this is a sociology 101 class and the film was well received and promoted a lot of discussion on the meaning of chosen family and it's power.
3,I'm still not sure how I feel about this one!,"This DVD requires a Firm Step with incline and the sculpting stick. I didn't have a sculpting stick, but managed to make it work with dumbells. It's a quick workout that gets your muscles pretty warm, but I didn't really sweat at all (and I only consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser). Also, some of the exercises require you to lay on or lean on the step in ways that I found outrageously uncomfortable and was forced to move to the floor. The abs section is TOUGH and the cueing by the instructor is very good throughout. Also, (and yes, I know it's not in the title, but...)it would have been nice to have a short upper body segment as well. I'll use it, but not as often as my other Firm DVDs."
2,"Hips, tighs and Abs","It is ok I think but too many tools are needed to do it properly. I travel a lot and can't take things with me all around, so don't use it much but if you have all the tools at home it is effective. The abs section is at the end and very short too, mostlly focused on hips and tighs."
5,I enjoyed it,"This was a really good lower body workout in less time.You have to make sure you have the sculpting stick.It uses it a lot in this video.You need one pair of dumbells for this about 3-8 pounds depending on how strong you are and you will need bench or something to lie on while doing intense leg toning,The ab part is really intense using the sculpting stick my abs were burning after this video.If you have all the equipment it uses will love it.Pam Cauthen from Firm Strength returns in this video,I was really happy to see her back.She is a really good instructer from another one of my favorite Firms.This tape is only for Firm believers."
1,Disappointment,"First of all, let me say that while seeing a thin woman usually doesn't trouble me, I agree with another reviewer that Pam and Christa look AWFUL in this video. Scrawny, emaciated, fragile. The workout itself isn't nearly as challenging for lower body as I'd hoped - I've been doing the Lower Body Sculpt (with Jen Carman) which is tough even after you've been doing it for a while, and this just doesn't compare. Don't bother."
4,An interesting look at non-main stream manga,"A collection of tales ranging from the almost dream-like Swing Shell (a story of a young girl coping with incest) to the bizarre Puntures (a strange look into the copings of modern society). Not every story in this collection, will appeal to everyone and it's definitely not for the kiddies. They will at least challenge any preconcieve notion as to what manga is about and change our views about another culture and perhaps ourselves. I highly recommend this book if only for the story Swing Shell due to its artwork and the way it deals with a very serious topic."
5,Super Sweet,"These cables are just as good if not better than Mogami... When considering the deals you can find here on Amazon, you just cant beat them! They are extremely durable and rugged and are great for recording or rack gear!"
1,JUNK,"This thing is a piece of crap. The directions are a joke. No help at all. None of the parts match up right. They leave you guessing as to what to do next. Save your money,this thing is a major piece junk. Sorry i bought this thing. I will be returning this thing ASAP. NO STARS FROM ME1"
3,Annoying Characters,"Botanist Theo Bloomer is browbeaten by his sister into chaperoning his college-age niece and her friends on a posh spring-break vacation in Jamaica. Their personal pool-boy (!)is murdered, but why? Then one of the coeds is kidnapped. How will Uncle Theo cope? The real mystery is why would he want to, when almost all of the college kids are spoiled, self-centered brats.The writing is fine, but Theo Bloomer was not a strong enough personality to overcome the rest of the annoying characters in this mystery."
5,Adorable for a family,"My daughter, (3 years old), loves that her sheep famly has the 2 baby twins. They have the sweetest faces and are soft to the touch. On the boy twin only the head moves, the body is not fully possable like on the girl twin, or most calico crtters but this doesn't seem to both her. The bottle & binky that comes with them fits perfect in their tiny mouth hole. These peieces are really small and I wouldn't recomend them for a child under 3."
1,"Dull, not at all scary","Movie about mentally messed up women, not horror. Unpleasant ending, all women end up looking bad. Painful to watch at times. Waste of money."
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie has no plot, poor acting, and is not a true vampire film. It's just a couple girl roomates who have a blood fetish, cut each other with razors, and drink blood from each other. This movie is a complete waste of time unless you too have a blood fetish and enjoy watching people drink from each other."
1,Waste of time,The only thing scary about this movie is the time i took to watch it.My grandma watch's better soap operas on tv.
