4,A fun romp for kids and kids at heart,"I'm a big Hey Arnold! fan and I think this film does justice to the show in most cases. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but it's definitely a good movie kids and kids at heart will enjoy. There are also some lessons anyone can learn from it. For one, Arnold is always the optimist, showing kids to look on the bright side because ""Somebody has to."" The kids all band together despite differences for a common cause. Despite almost impossible odds, Arnold, Gerald and even, yes, Helga do their best to persevere and save their neighborhood. Finally, when Helga's father offers her the chance to be rich (His beeper store will be placed in the new mall-plex), she ultimately choses to pursue her unrequited love object by helping Arnold save the neighborhood, showing how those we love are more important than money. All in all, HA! is a funny, feel-good movie that'll have kids cheering as well as teaching them some important lessons."
3,It's Okay.,"This movie was alright. It could have been a lot better without the constant use of the word ""Neighborhood."" Hearing that word over and over again is just irritating."
3,"Man, that deep voice is a pain in the...!","This movie wasn't bad. It was a typical Hey, Arnold! affair:-Arnold uses his usual level-headed point of view-Helga teases Arnold about how ""pathetic"" he is (but we all know how that *really* goes)!-Gerald assists Arnold in almost whatever he does, but doesn't stand by as an empty toolBut the movie has a premise: Arnold and his friends have to protect the city from losing a big part of itself because ATi, a new and big corporation wants to come in and tear it down; the flower shop, the meat shop, etc, etc.It has all that you have come to expect, with a small twist at the end. One of my favorite characters (besides Arnold, of course) was the quirky mortician towards the end, he was creepy but in a very nice way.Do Arnold and friends save the day? Well, I'm sure most of you saw this back in 2002 or have seen it since, but if not, then rent it from somewhere and watch it. Worth a look.3 1/2 stars."
4,Fans won't be dissapointed,"The plot is as follows: A man named Sheck says he'll destroy Arnold's neighborhood. Arnold and his friend, Gerald, try to stop him. Pretty routine stuff, but with these characters, I'm interested."
5,Beautiful jade,"I ordered two of these pendants for Valentine's day gifts for my sons' girlfriends. The pendant is very beautiful and both noticeable and subtle at the same time. I had never seen pink jade before but it is a very pale, soft pink and looks lovely against all skin tones. I purchased, also from this site, the sterling silver Italian 1mm box chain to hang the pendant from, but it would be beautiful on a silk ribbon or cord as well."
5,an amazing tale without gunfight,"I have just seen this movie and it was absolutly brilliant. The scenery, the actors the story which is pretty similar to the original Servantes book. John Lithgow is fabulous as the don, sometimes funny, sometimes very serious and sometimas extremely shy. You cannot help but listen to him and you belive him more than the family who tell that the don has only dreams. When the prince and his wife (the beautiful - just like her mother - Isabella) make fun of him, you can really hate them and want to help Quijote and Pansa. John Lithgow has played not just with his body but with his eyes too. His eyes. At the end he has pratically no lines he just look at us and it is perfect. It was a beautiful story with a talented, real actors. Don't miss is if you like films that touch you heart and soul. I give 5+1 stars."
4,a Good Movie..,"I have to admit i am not a big fan of John Lithgow, BUt in this version of Don quixote, He played the part of a delusional schitzophrenic perfectly. this story follows the book fairly well, alot better then youd expect. it would make an o.k. family movie but you can bet your money that your kids would get bored. i say that because it doesnt have the Flash and Glitter like so many of todays kid shows. if you have read the book, seen the play (Man of LaMancha) then this is a must for you. superb acting, superb visualisations of the illusions, and overall a good Flic."
4,Good Preformance,"I have to admit i am not a big fan of John Lithgow, BUt in this version of Don quixote, He played the part of a delusional schitzophrenic perfectly. this story follows the book fairly well, alot better then youd expect. it would make an o.k. family movie but you can bet your money that your kids would get bored. i say that because it doesnt have the Flash and Glitter like so many of todays kid shows. if you have read the book, seen the play (Man of LaMancha) then this is a must for you. superb acting, superb visualisations of the illusions, and overall a good Flic."
5,One of the greatest books ever written.,"This book is a must have for every household. It indeed contains the secret for a long and healthy life. Not only does it contain necessary information for eating properly, it contains information imperative for a healthy Mind and Spirit. This book should be used for a class in every school and college world wide. I own a few books written from the Readings of Edgar Cayce but this one is the best hands down. I just received The Complete Readings of Edgar Cayce on DVD-ROM and it also is a must have if you truly are interested in the vast knowledge left to us by Edgar Cayce. He indeed was a gift of God to us all. My goal is to bring the wisdom of this great man to all, especially my African American and Hispanic brothers and sisters. Sadly, Many of us have never heard of Edgar Cayce.Love, Peace and Gratitude,Joshua McNeill"
4,THE EDGAR CAYCE HANDBOOK FOR HEALTH THROUGH DRUGLESS THERAPY,Lots of great resources; sometimes the index doesn't reference well with the actual page numbers
2,Saddened by my purchase,I'm a long time Cayce fan and am always looking for new books regarding his readings. That being said I was earnestly not impressed with this one
5,Excellent Book in Excellent Shape,I was very pleased to receive this book so quickly and in such perfect condition. I haven't had a chance to read much of it yet but what I have read is very good. Jan J.
3,BOOK GAVE SOME INSIGHT BUT NOT ENOUGH,Old book binding cracked after I received book. Book gave bits and pieces on Edgar Cayce historically though another's interpretation. I am still looking for one book that rounds out Edgar Cayce more concerning health/healing. I was trying to find out more info on Cayce as an intoductory book this did not answer all my questions on him and left me looking for further books that would fill the bill.
5,For every mother of a teenage driver,"Janet Wong uses driving as a metaphor for growing up. As the mother of a 16-year-old son with two moving violations and two accidents under his belt already, the collection made me laugh and cry."
4,Great Ninja action!!!,"I rented this movie to see Sho Kosugi and he was great in it!! the story is about an anti-terrorists group lead by sho kosugi. When a school bus of tourists is hijacked, the three anti terrorists must fnd out where they are and stop the terrorists from getting there demands meet. They want their leader, a pysco murder that is in prison, to be released. Only Sho and he two companions can stop him and free the hostages. In a action comedy that will have you on the edge of your seat, they set out through the jungle to find the terrorists hide out. With Sho leading the pack and using all his ninja skills to defeat the enemy the battle is on!!! If you are a Sho Kosugi fan, or just a martial arts fan you should go and see this. I thought it was a great movie, and Sho was so awesome!!!"
1,Meow,"I'm an old die hard fan of Sho. This movie must have put him in sum serious bankruptcy. Not even close to Master Lee, but atleast Sho doesn't Chuck up the speed of the camera. I thought the renegade soldiers were the best actors. I treated myself to a very special dinner because I was able to finish the rest of the movie. I still have the DVD, WHY! because it was my first DVD and I thought about it. I've watched it once about a year ago and have forgotten how cheesey it is so, I think I'll watch it again to see what the cheesey plot was about, you know what...if they didn't waste their time making cheesey movies that only ptupid seople would buy they could give all this wasted money to the homeless."
2,Brigette's second album did her justice.,"DEFINITELY steer clear of this one, folks! Even Ms. McWilliams herself admitted she had ZERO creative control in the development of her debut at the time. When you hear it all the way through, that fact becomes even more apparent. A Mary J. Blige ""wannabe""? McWilliams??? NOT IN A BILLION YEARS, LOL!!!So 'Take Advantage of Me' should be thoroughly deleted from Virgin's catalog and her superior sophomore release ('Too Much Woman') be brought back into circulation ASAP. Many of today's young people are actually being robbed of some pretty good music in recent years, especially coming from this talented woman whose second album has quickly become one of the best kept secrets around.GET WITH THE PROGRAM ALREADY, VIRGIN!!!"
3,Blankets of Playboys,"This cd is diffrent from her latter two, but nonetheless i love it. This cd is a mid 90s newjack (adina howard flava) sound with some jazz elements, and her vocals always soulful.Stand out tracks...""i get the job done""""take advantage of me""""blankets of playboys"""
3,"Okay, but STILL........","I did think this was one of the best BSC books, but my own dad lost his job not too long ago and didn't find another THAT fast, which I thought was unrealistic and highly uncommon. It was very clever, though, that Mallory's brothers and sisters (and even she!) found ways to help raise money for the family, for example, Nickey, one of Mallory's younger brothers, volunteered to find a paper route. And, of course, Mallory decided to babysit, but this time in Kristy's rich neighborhood, hoping to earn a little extra."
4,Comfortable design shoes with nice colors.,Bought from a shop before and was very satisfied with the comfort and design.Happy to find the Earth Shoes here.
2,Nothing special,"I bought these shoes to see if they would help ease some back pain at work. No luck yet. I also find the scuffed up toes disappointing. The literature on these shoes certainly falls into the too good to be true category for me.Moreover, I was surprised by all the packaging for these things. Two boxes, paper and canvas bags for each of them certainly seems excessive for a shoe claiming to be earth friendly. I prefer my Merrells."
2,Boring,"The concept of this film is intriguing, however the execution of the story didn't resonate well with me. I'll admit that there are some scenes that are chilling, such as, when he visits the School for the Blind and is terrified of how blind children look and act. I am quite disappointed that it's not as visually stunning as Majid Majidi's A Color in Paradise and Children of Heaven."
4,A Visual Journey Contrasted With Inner Torment,"The terrific Majidi gives us a much more somber, spare effort in The Willow Tree, compared to the childlike exuberance of ""Heaven"", and the soulful ""Paradise"". This film does not offer happy endings, but it does offer a visual journey contrasted with the inner torment of an everyman.If you only liked Children of Heaven, this may not be for you. But if you enjoyed the depth of Color of Paradise, and even the flawed Baran, this is a must-see, in more ways than one.([...]"
4,Another Bryan Ferry Must-have,"I still listen to this album frequently. I am a lover of Bryan Ferry's music and this album, in my opinion, comes very close to the feel of Boys and Girls and Avalon. Bete Noire is a more upbeat album.What I love about Mamouna is that it is ""chill"" music. Listening to it evokes something haunting and mysterious to me. My all-time favourite song is the closing track, ""Chain Reaction"". Try listening to this song while lying in the dark. I absolutely can't get enough of it.This is a great collection of original music from Ferry. If you're a fan, get out there and pick this one up. You won't be disappointed."
4,EACH TRACK IS THE AURAL EQUIVALENT OF A DREAM,"A lot of artists sing ABOUT dreams, but Mamouna was Bryan Ferry's attempt at creating the aural equivalent of dreams THEMSELVES. This is not an album that jumps out and punches you in the nose, but rather envelops you slowly with understated, trance-like rhythms, subdued solos, falling minor key chord progressions and haunting vocals. In lesser hands, this material would sound homogenized and dull, but Ferry's distinct voice and persistent grooves keep the record percolating along. U2 producer and former bandmate Brian Eno is back on board as well, bringing an element of ""mannered chaos"" that threatens to break through the placid surface at any moment. Of course, like all pleasant dreams it ends way too soon. Highly recommended to people who like an elegant, luxurious sound tempered with menacing undertones. Stand out tracks: ""Mamouna"", ""Gemini Moon"", ""The Only Face"""
2,mediocre songs buried beneaeth production wizardry,"By this stage of the game (early 90s) it's increasingly obvious that Bryan Ferry was lapsing into stylistic self parody, and ""Mamouna"" would have to be a contender for the most perfectly produced piece of easy listening fluff in the history of recorded music. That's really not enough, though, because Ferry's songs have grown increasingly solipsistic and insubstantial with the years. ""Mamouna"" can float by without notice, practically hook-free. With the exception of the single ""Your Painted Smile"", and to a lesser extent the title track, ""Mamouna"" offers the aural equivalent of being slowly suffocated with a scented pillow."
2,"nice on paper, but...","With such a great list of musicans on this album (Nile Rodgers and Brian Eno are just two) it dissapoints greatly. Though similar in sound to the excellnt Avalon, Ferry just doesn't have the same well crafted songs as he did in 1982. What results is an empty, souless albums which at its best (Mamouna) washes over pleasantly and at its worst (N.Y.C.) can be embarassing. While the production is pleasant and often innovative (thanks to Eno) it can't cover up the fact that the album is actually incredibly dull."
3,Not worth the wait,"I'm not surprised BF's record company pressured him to release an album of covers before Mamouna.Yes, the production is slick. It has an intriguing ""sound"". But what happened to BF's songwriting? He used to combine ambience with melodic hooks - like in Boys and Girls or Bete Noir. All we're left with is BF's everlasting cool but there's no teeth to this work. The fact he's followed up with yet another album of covers suggests he's lost his songwiting touch.I've worn out my Roxy/BF collection but this CD has hardly left the case."
2,"love Ferry, hate the covers","When Bryan Ferry writes and preforms he does great and I can't get enough of it. When he is just preforming other's music, he is just another garage band. I found this one uninspired. On the other hand, his Frantic, and Bete Noir albums are maybe qwirky but are much better. When he is 'on', like Boys and Girls, he can't be beat."
4,"First Contact, Second Extras","Following the trail of reviews already written will give you an accurate portrait of this movie. I would like to re-emphasize that there are no extras. Trailers are not extras, they are mandatory. First Contact needed extras to push the disc above rental status."
5,A GREAT MOVIE!!!!,"When I first watched this movie, I was, ""WOW!"" Jonathan Frakes proves himself as both a great director and a great actor. This movie ROCKS!! It's awesome. I expecially liked the scene in which the Enterprise-E enters the fray against the Borg cube. The visual affects are astounding.When the movie introduced Zephram Cochran, I was, ""That's him?!"" However, I liked him besides that he got drunk all the time. One of my most favorite lines in the movie was said by Cochran: ""What are you some kind of astronauts . . . on some kind of star trek?"" That line simply sums up all of the Star Trek movies. Bottom line: A CANNOT MISS FOR ST FANS!!! BUY THIS!!!!!!! AN ESSENTIAL!!!!!!"
1,Did the IQ of the writer drop 140 points?,"Sigh.. Star Trek TNG has had several very intelligent shows about time travel. And then comes this. The crew seems to go out of its way to tell the Past people about the future. ""blah blah This is where a huge statue of you will be blah"" -Geordi to Cochrane. This movie was just annoying in its casual disregard for logic. The Enterprise sees Earth covered with Borg. Then they prevent it. Umm como se dice parodox? Anyway Im not as geeky as this post may seem but I dont like to be insulted by stupid plots that havent been thought out. Stay Away."
1,"Captains' log ... ""Boring!!!""","Don't bother with this one. How a film with a very promising start can end up so trite and dull is beyond me. ""The Wrath of Kahn"" is the only Star Trek film that lives up to (or, actually, beyond) the hype. The best performance in this film is by James Cromwell who has never had a disappointment performance. Sorry but he can not save this insignificant film. When I went to see this in the theatre I could actually hear two people snoring behind me. Everyone else started laughing. Had it not been for moment of sheer entertainment my money would have been completely wasted."
5,Great Movie!,"I'm a major Trekkie. I have seen this many times, adding it to my Star Trek collection. Great story and acting."
4,Best of a disappointing film series,"The crew of the Enterprise-E pursues a Borg ship back in time to foil their plan to change human history by preventing mankind's first contact with another species. This adventure is the best of the generally underwhelming Next Generation films, with good solid action and a fast-moving plot. Still, my general criticism of these films remains--they all feel like expanded episodes of the TV series. I really wish they had taken the opportunity to take these characters into new territory like the Original Series films did. Even if they split up the crew, I'm sure that a talented writer could have devised stories that would have required them to come back together every couple years or so."
4,Star Trek: First Contact,This was one of the best Star Trek movies. It's exciting and brings so many of the characters together. Of course when the Enterprise is fighting the Borg it is always interesting. I've enjoyed this movie over the years.
4,First Contact... should have been the last contact!!,"This was the last movie that was even halfway decent. After this one, I don't know why any more were ever made. There is so much you can do with the star trek franchise and THIS film proves it. It's the first time they have the screen all to themselves (which is to say without the old crew) and it's the only time that they do a decent job of carrying on the torch that was passed to them by the original crew.First Contact has some of the best actors around. James Cromwell and Alfrie Woodard are positively wonderful additions to the Star Trek phenomena. There were just too many questions left. Too many loose ends left untied. And too many times when I said ""so what."" during the show. The crew exists as cardboard cutouts of their television personas. The most dynamic character in this movie is the Borg Queen. And that is just amazingly disappointing."
3,STAR TREK MAKES CONTACT,"IF YOUR FAN OF STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION, YOU WILL JUST LOVE THIS MOVIE. WITH EXCELLENT SPECIAL EFFECTS, A VERY INTERESTING STORYLINE, FINE INSIDE DIRECTING BY JONATHAN FRAKES AND THOSE STAR TREK CHARACTERS WE LOVE. YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE"
5,Don't Resist...,"A definite high point in the film series. My personal favorite. The ""Next Generation"" cast takes over the franchise with absolute grace. Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score was sorely overlooked for an Academy Award nomination. The film is skillfully directed by Jonathan Frakes and the actors really get a chance to shine. Appealing to the non-Trekker as well. The Special Collector's Edition DVD improves on the widescreen transfer of the original DVD print."
5,The thrills are alive with the sound of music.,"This is my favorite of all the TNG movies and to me second only to Wrath of Khan among all the feature films.It's not very cerebral stuff, but the story is continually moved along by action, adventure, beautiful special effects, humor (including the painful to watch ""star trek"" line) and most of all a brilliant soundrack. This is the kind of soundtrack where you can just crank up the soundtrack CD (which I own) and enjoy it as a piece of music without even seeing the movie.Top it off with a moving tribute to Jerry Goldsmith and a wealth of other bonuses that I haven't even got around to watching yet. This is a Trek movie that you don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy."
5,Great for Trekkers and great popular art,"As good as Ster Trek gets dramatically, and a fascinating, even moving commentary on technology. It can be evil, dehumanizing, even seductive like the Borg, or yearning towards greater possibilities, like Dr Cochran's Whole Earth Catalog-like bunch of friends converting an abandoned weapon of war into man's first warp-drive starship. None of this would be worth much, of course, if you couldn't just kick back and enjoy it as well."
5,Star Trek - First Contact (Special Collector's Edition),I just finished a marathon of Star Trek with the purchases I just got from Amazon. I enjoyed it so much. I also purchased the following DVD's with this purchase:Star Trek - The Original Crew Movie Collection (Special Edition)Star Trek - First Contact (Special Collector's Edition)Star Trek Generations (Special Collector's Edition)
3,Watch the Series,"I have to agree with another review I saw here. This is the best of the Star Trek films. Still, there are a whole bunch of episodes in the series better than this film. All Good Things, Tapestry, Q Who, Family, Chain of Command Part 2, Future Imperfect, Elementary Dear Data, The Chase, Who Watches the Watchers, all of these episodes are better than any of the films. The film is still okay, but it just can't top some of the episodes in the series."
4,It still manages to be better then most sci fi stuff out now,"Ill be honest with you like the Kirk-and-crew cast better the generations. the chrachters were more amusing and memorable the new crew has always been a bit stale. Contact seems to be the franchises most action oriented chapter yet. Here there against the borg. The movies action is actualy pretty nice, and the special effects are considerably revamped. But the plot is solid enough but not the most engaging. But if anything though ill give the movie credit for being the most intense of the batch since The Undiscovered country. So for all itd faults it still a solid sci-fi adevnture."
1,What the hell do people see in this film,"I have have been a loyal Star trek fan for many years and this is the second worst part of the star trek francise I have seen (Followed by Star trek Voyager) The way I see it any (so-called) Star Trek fan who says any good word about this has a screw loose. Even though you might be able to call it an average film (for NON-TREKKIES) it has no place in the star trek universe. The amount of in-consistent information in this film is so vast (after watching TOS episodes about First Contact 'metimorhisis' (I don't know if that is spelt right) and the 7 TNG Borg episodes) I haven't got time to right about them all, if you do want to read them look at the anonymous vevier from NH, United States (where ever that is) who is the next best thing to my best friend."
1,Yuck,"I hated First Contact. It was a travesty of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and a really nasty film to boot."
4,So-so blu-ray transfer,"I think First Contact was by far one of the top films of the Star Trek canon, and after the bangup job that they did with restoring and remastering The Original Series, I was sort of hoping that it would transfer over into theFor example, there was this piece of ""fuzz"" that was on the bottom of the screen while Picard and Riker were having their first chat (the scene where he's got Berloiz's opera really loudly in his Ready Room) that looked like it was caught during the film transfer. Seriously, it was huge!Otherwise, it's not too bad. The sound's loud enough to get the neighbors upset with you, and the film makes you forget some of the weaker TV shows and the last movies featuring The Next Generation cast.It's just an average transfer, and for an awesome film, it deserved better."
5,"Best of the 3 ""Generations"" Films","""First Contact"" is certainly the best of the three Generations movies (""Generations"", ""First Contact"", and ""Insurrection""), and perhaps even the best of all the star trek movies. There are many reasons for this, but the single reason that stands out is Alice Krige's SPECTACULAR performance as the devilishly seductive yet disturbing Borg Queen. Her portrayl is nothing short of brilliance. The Borg Queen's scene with Data is worth the price of the video."
4,"If There Is To Be A Star Trek Horror Film, This Could Work","Upon watching this film for the 1st time, I found myself to be a little jumpy. The movie has a certain dark setting to it, combined with borg at every corner waiting to assimilate you and a certain sound with the background music, it could make one who is paranoid of such things a little jumpy. The beginning still gets me every time where Picard is at the sink, washing his face, and then......well, just gotta see for yourself if you have not yet. Overall, this is very good. Lots of action, good story line, and excellent jobs playing the character roles by the actors. If there is one thing I don't like, it's the time travel, again."
5,I think that it was a great movie!!!,"It was a great movie if you like star trek.With great specil effects,make-up and ""technolagy"".If your in to sci-fi this the movie for you!!!"
4,How about some extras Paramount!,"Come on Paramount,give us some extras on DVD-interviews,documentaries,TV spots,deleted scenes,the soundtrack etc. The Matrix,Contact and Shakespeare In Love have great extras and yet Star Trek fans are ignored.Paramount needs to wake up."
4,Zephram Cochrane is cool!,"Zephram Cochrane is king and really makes this movie. For once, ST has created a real person and not some noble ideal. In talking about his warp engine Cochrane says ""I did it for money... so I could retire to some tropical island surrounded by naked women."" (look of shock on my face) Yeah! I can believe this! This is real! Brilliant, a bit nuts, but still a human being. My only reason for not giving it that last star is that Picard is pulled too far out of character when it comes to having to blow up the ship. He's too resistant and whiney."
4,"Best ""Next Generation"" Movie","This is ""the"" movie that played, when Star Trek had it's finest day. The music, the writing, the acting, and the Directing are all supurb."
5,Resistance Is Futile!,"Star Trek: First Contact is considered the 2nd best Star Trek film (with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan considered the best). First Contact finds us confronted with the Borg who are trying to alter history by traveling to the past. The Enterprise-E crew find themselves transorped to the year 2063 where they must help Zefram Cochrane make his famous warp flight. But they will have to battle the Borg in order to achieve this momentous event.This special collectors edition is packed with special features that will delight you for hours. Disc One features 2-Audio Commentaries and a Text Commentary. Disc Two features hours of specials on every aspect on how this film came to life. Another great feature is a tribute to Jerry Goldsmith, which is the best feature.If you are a fan of First Contact you will enjoy this 2-Disc Edition. So sit back and prepare to get assimilated."
4,The adventure continues,"Eventhough this movie is one of my least favorites it deserves four stars for bringing a great addition to the colection. We have great TNG moments in it: cameos of loved characters, holodeck magic and one of Starfleets greatest foes. I loved the subplot about the First Contact, it brought a new perpective of the Starfleet culture.I don't espcially like the new Enterprise, looks too cartoonish next to the refited Enterprise and Enterprise-A. And I didn't like the devellopment of the Borg. I always thought of the Borg as a very misterious civilization, I think that all civilizations depicted in Star Trek express a different side of humanity and the Borg being the darkest one of all. Even so, it is very fun to watch and I definetly recommend it."
2,Ham-handed directing and a paper thin screenplay,"This a movie-length version of an average quality STNG episode. Frakes ham-handed directing really shows in scenes like the silly silo launch, and the ending where the Vulcan ship arrives and we have a picnic. Spielberg and Zemeckis have nothing to worry about from this hack.I was a big fan of the Star Trek TV series, but have always felt the movies were pure pap with plots slapped together to maximize box office receipts. First Contact continues in this tradition with a little something for everyone. Its like eating a meal of creamed beef, mashed potatoes, boiled okra, and vanilla cream pie. You're full when it's over, but it's hard to remember exactly what you ate."
2,Mindless Action,What is wrong with today's audience? Mindless action flicks like First Contact and Star Trek (2009) are eaten up like nothing else. Save your money and watch the first four Star Trek movies.
2,What is this movie about?,"Um, Convaluted story line, wooden characters. 'Nuff said. the only cool thing about this turkey is that it features Enterprise-E. Of course we could just get Inserection to see that and it would make more sense. It was worse than The Mummy Returns. And note I am a serious Trekkie not some sports jock who just wants to make fun of Star Trek cause he cant pronouce Borg."
3,"Good, but not great","If you're reading this, you probably are a star trek fan, and for those fans who have yet to see this one, don't expect too much. It's alot of fun to see borg assimilate the crew for the first 20 minutes but after that it becomes redundant and loses its edge. However, if you are not a die hard trekker, I reccommend this movie as a good look at the trek franchise without the confusing techno-babble that turns off so many. There is a lot of action and excitement, and most people should enjoy it."
4,The Borg is a great story line,"I watched this movie and was thrilled how they weaved the borg conquering the world with the ""First Contact"" ( I will not tell you what that is until you see the movie). Jean Luc is great and while I usually am only a Star Trek purist (only watch the originals), this was worthy of a watch.However, I cannot give any Star Trek movie that is without the original cast more than 4 stars.Kevin"
5,One of the best Star Trek film's,"A brilliant film and probably the best one involving the Next Generation crew. The effects are very good and it has all the thing's a Star Trek film needs. A brilliant enemy, a brilliant crew and a brilliant story line. It get's a lot more darker than the TV series, which add's a nice twist. Also the acting of the borg Queen and Data is fantastic.It follow's on nicely from the TV series. It's a wounderful Sci-Fi film in it's self and you should be able to get into it even if your not a trekkie fan. Very enjoyable"
5,Assimilate THIS!,"Star Trek First Contact is a GREAT TNG movie with tons of action and tons of laughs.The movie takes place in I think 2063, after the 3rd world war, and most governments have been screwed. The Borg have attacked that time to assimilate earth in the past, to prevent them from making ""First Contact""(with Vulcans that is) So the crew of the Enterprise have to fight off the Borg while helping the man that made first contact to succeed in executing the first ever warp drive. That character Mr Cochran is very funny, it's like in TNG's time he was portrayed as a HERO, yet in his mind, he's in it for the money, booze, and girls.Now about the VHS, I have the Widescreen VHS tape, the quality is fair, though the it's a bit ""meh"" at times, though it could be because I'm watching it on an old late 70's to mid 80's TV.I would highly recommend this to any new Trekkie, this is my second favorite Trek movie."
5,A hot movie.... combines both action and comedy successfully,"This is a dual threaded action/comedy Star Trek adventure. Up on the Enterprise orbiting the post World War III earth, the Borg are trying to take the Enterprise, which is heavy action and adventure of Picard versus the Borg leader. While on the earth surface Will Riker, Diana Troi, and Zephran Cocran (this character was introduced in the original Star Trek series) are trying to get the first spacecraft with warp drive ready for launch. They are under no big pressure so there are many jokes interlaced... This is one of the best in the Star Trek Series.... a kind of ""Star Trek: the Voyage Home"" humor mixed with ""Star Trek: The Warth of Kahn"" action."
4,"Well executed, but it's missing something. . .","Jonathan Frakes did an admirable job with this movie, but I think he did better with Insurrection. First Contact, while very good in its own way, lacked the punch that the other Star Trek movies had. And the black lady just gets on my nerves! She wasn't well cast. But, aside from that, the action is good, the visuals are very nice, and the screenplay is well put together. A worthy addition to any Star Trek fans library."
4,A split movie,"I found this move really entertaining. It kept me interested until the end, and it was mysteriously creepy for a Star Trek film - Picard and crew walking amongst the Borg was nail biting stuff. However, the ground plot was boring, but necessary. Perhaps it was the characters on the ground. The Borg's costumes aren't as good as they are in ST:Voyager.All in all, I can recommend this movie to any science fiction fan, and also to anyone that likes a bit of suspense."
3,Not bad for a glorified TV episode.,"This was the best Star Trek yet because A) none of the original cast were in it, and B) well, B is for Borg -- collectively, the best antogonists since Q. Best scene: The Borg queen gets dressed. Worst scene: Data and the Borg queen kiss, with more combined makeup than Tammy Fay Baker. Best line: ""It's my first ray gun."" Worst line: ""And you're all astronauts, on some kind of star trek."""
5,Star Trek Forever,"This is one of the best Star Trek movies ever. Good humor throughout, just like Gene R. liked to make. Still miss him!"
2,BRING BACK WILLIAM SHATNER...PLEASE!!!,All I can say is that this is the worst Star Trek movie of all time. Star Trek 2 was the best and that was it for this boring and stupid series. Patrick Stewart does not have the charisma of the great William Shatner. Three words: GIVE IT UP!!!
2,Plastic lid is very cheap,"I haven't even had the chance to use this attachment (to make curry paste) before the lid fell off a very low shelf. One of the side catches broke off from a 1' fall. The plastic food processing unit that came with the blender is much more substantial/thicker plastic than this. Plus, I would have expected a longer blade to accommodate the larger volume."
3,Quick review,"Purchased two years ago. Handle is separating slightly from itself - joined plastic. Food items placed inside have a tendency to rise up the outward sloping sides and so you get mixed results - some food is mush and some is barely chopped. You have to keep removing the lid to scrape the side to get things back in. They should have gone with straight up and down sides. Doesn't handle butter/shortening dough crusts very well - power is there, but the stuff doesn't seem to mix - maybe due to the sides again. Blade is sharp, but doesn't extend all the way to the sides - likely another problem with my dough, chopping problem. It has served its purpose which is to chop stuff."
2,About what I expected...,"I've honestly only used this once since I've got it, but I did notice that where the two pieces of plastic come together on the top and bottom of the handle it's not as solid as I would prefer. I expect that it will end up looking yucky from dirt that finds it's way in but I cant get out.---------I'm editing this a few years later to add that not the tabs on the lid that hold it place have both broken off. So now you must hold the lid on to operate it. I have not used it often."
3,I've decided to buy the more expensive one...,"I am trying to purchase another small food processor for my daughters. I have the more expensive one listed at Amazon... and btw the only place you can get one other than ebay where they are more expensive! Oster doesn't sell them right now! After reading the other reviews, I'm going to get the more expensive one because mine is at least 20 years old and works like a charm, and I don't want to have one I have to be cautious with that it might break, or some other detail."
3,Sadly not as great as I thought,"It does fit my blender, but it does NOT hold very much. Food also splashes over the hole in the middle if it is to full. It is heavy duty just small."
1,Don't buy it,No quality. Jar is not strong. No other words to fill this space. No other words to fill this space. No other words to fill this space.
2,O.K. but Cheap Engineering,"This accessory works pretty well, but the locking mechanism is poorly designed. After several months of use the locking flaps on the bowl broke. It can still be used, but the lid has to be hold down in place with your hands. Another case of you get what you pay."
5,Perfect,"Works perfectly. Solid construction. Has flipped up numerous times when hitting driftwood with no damage, just flipped back down and back in business!"
5,all the warriors books,"I love kitties, so I love all these books. They are well written and I certainly do look at my cats in a different way. I hope these books never stop coming."
5,the search for a perfect book has ended! By Silverstar,for a long time i have been looking for the perfect book. When I first read the first one I fell in love with it at once. This book is a great 4th instalment for this series.
5,Best Series Ever,Our 9 yr. old can't stop reading these books. He says the books are really exciting and he can't put the book down. He loves the battles and the cat warriors. What an excellent series!
5,Cats galore for the fourth time! Written by Moonfur,"Hi it's Moonfur!This book kept me eyein' out for A Dangerous Path for a long while! Fireheart is now so respected that he is now ThunderClan's deputy! But Bluestar had gone through trauma with Tigerclaw's awful ambitions. It took him too far and now he is exiled and a roaming rogue, and Fireheart can't get him off his mind.Bluestar, now suddenly grumpy and old, has walked away from StarClan and won't turn back. So grumpy and old that Fireheart's ceremony didn't take place at the correct time, which may cause trouble. Graystripe is off with RiverClan now, and other cats have some reason to dislike him, except for Sandstorm, who is growing into something else with Fireheart...The hot days of greenleaf"
5,Warriors #4: Rising Storm,The ending was the most nerve taking thing I had ever read! This is the only series I expect to finish and I know that will happen the next book will be on my list of books I have in st least the next 5 minutes!!
3,SORRY,Sorry Hunter. I cannot believe I ever rated Warriors 5 stars after I tried the Secret Series and Harry Potter. YOU WHO R READING THIS SHOULD TRY TOO!!! It IS a command!!!!!!!
4,Great book- I couldn't live without it.,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. my best friend told me about it, promising to bring it to school soon, and that night my mom brought home the second book from the library. Now me, my best friend and another friend are totally obsessed with these books.In my opinion, this is not the most well written book in the series. The story line is great though! Fireheart has become deputy, and Bluestar is not well. She is troubled since Tigerclaw's banishment, and will not be a part of the Clan; so Fireheart is practically leading the clan. Cloudpaw is causing trouble in many disrespectful ways, ShadowClan is having trouble of it's own, and half the Clan thinks Fireheart's deputyship will be cursed. And it's got an exiting ending, but it made me so mad because the fifth one wasn't out yet! I won't say anything else, as not to ruin the plot, but I will say this: This is a great book. I advise it to anyone who likes cats and/or fantasy."
4,Pretty good,A good book. Really though if you are new to the series get one first! And Into the Wild book one not Midnight. I had a friend that did that and she didn't get it at all! Besides that spioles it!
5,Amazing Book,"This book was truly amazing. A cliffhanger, and amazingly detailed I truly loved this book. Erin Hunter wows me. A Spectacular Book"
5,Aaaaaaah! I can't stop reading it!,"Fireheart is BACK with his apprentice, Cloudpaw, for more treachery (sorry), and troubles. Fireheart is having trouble consoling Bluestar, still troubled by Tigerclaw's betrayal, and handling the duties of being deputy for ThunderClan. Fireheart tries to take over for Bluestar, hide her misery, maintain the Clan, and face an enemy he'd hope he would never see again (guess who?). With his ""friend"" Sandstorm, he struggles to maintain his ""special"" friendship. READ THE DARN BOOK!"
4,Lenox China Nativity 3-piece set,"Product was as depicted and arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Unfortunately, it was not a match with the set my gift recipient needed (not the fault of Amazon or the vendor). When I had to return it, the vendor was extremely accomodating to my situation and worked to find the appropriate Lenox set. I compliment her highly on her professionalism and personal care. I would definitely purchase from her again."
2,not what i ordered,I finally found the urinal that i have used for years and when i recieved it. It was clear and with a really cheap cap not blue as pictured i use the blue so you can't see the contents the clear would be ok but the lids are cheap it wont be long before it would break off where it attaches at the handle and of course my old lid is to big to go on the new.I AM VERY DISSATISFIEDJW
5,Fantastic,"I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your work in making movies for families to watch and to show our lost friends. Thank you for not being ashamed and making it easier for me to not be. Please, Please keep it up! God Bless you, Lisa Bochman"
4,"Enjoy now, analyze later","It has to be one of the greatest injustices of all time being Paul McCartney. Not only were you part of the most trascendental bands in all rock history, but also, you are one of the most succesfulls songwriters of all time, and because of that you are your biggest enemy of your own work. People always expect to hear 5 ""Yesterday's"", 3 ""Hey Jude's"", 2 ""Long and winding road's"" and one ""Band on the Run"".For me, Paul is just an rock musician who writes in a way that makes me enjoy a greater part of his work. That way I can appreciate his new albums and thus give me the chance to learn to love them. Sometimes he makes deaf albums, and also makes bad single choices. This is not one of these times. ""Fine Line"" is a great uptempo song, with great melody, simple words and lots of ""trinkets"" here and there. The B-sides are good and surely will find a place in not few fans preferences."
4,I like it...two out of three ain't bad,"Fine Line is easily the best song on Paul's new CD. It is upbeat and catchy. Comfort of Love is a nice too, a rocker that is better than many of the songs on the Chaos and Creation CD. Growing Up And Falling Down is a rather dull song, not much of a tune. Paul's voice is uninspired. Since neither of these last two songs are on the Chaos and Creation CD, it is a must-have for McCartney fans.BEWARE: This CD is copy protected. It played fine on my boom box, but required a special player to be installed on my computer (so I can't use any of my preferred players). The silly part is, you can still make a copy if you have the least knowledge of how to do it...which bootleggers have. So, why create a hassel for non-bootleggers (who spend the money)? Go figure."
2,Disposal Forgettable pop,"Even his legacy as a Beatle can't save the new single from being disposal forgettable formula. There is nothing interesting here except that McCartney is back from a 4 year absense. ""Jenny Wren"" is a better song than this, which McCarney seems to have written on auto-pilot. His days of being innovator are long behind him. From anyone else, it would get nowhere, not a great buy, I would say wait for the album."
1,Was This Guy Really in The Beatles?,"I just listened to the whole record on AOL Listening Party. There's no doubt this record will be heralded as the best McCartney record since Band On The Run, but what's really up with Paul is every record is worse than the last.As far as I can tell every tune had a fragmant of an idea behind it, which was then turned into a tune in the studio. By the time the bridge arrives, McCartney is hacking out uninspired chord progessions layered with horrible, clumsy lyrics.I feel sorry for the guy from Radiohead. He must be dreading the diplomatic reviews he is sure to recieve from artists he has done good work with."
5,best of sherlock holmes!!,"wonderful set, so much fun to listen to during car rides and at home when relaxing. the wine commercials are almost as interesting as the actual stories! the voice actors are great, watson charming as ever and sherlock more clever and witty played out live."
5,the game is a foot and well worth it!!,This item is such a great product! In my previous review I said the price was really high but it has come down and for 20 dollars you get 50 episodes of Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce at the top of their form. Don't hesitate to get this You will treasure this as you listen to the best duo who ever portrayed Holmes & Watson.Just sit back and listen and you can actually imagine Sir Basil & Sir Nigel in these new adventures like they were mini-movies for your imagination!
4,A Must Have!,"Though not a real mechanic, these manuals contain so much need to know information and are very well organized. Even encourages us to take on some of the more minor repairs and adjustments with the step by step instructions given."
1,ok but had a major complaint using first time.,We used this book to replace the pads on the brakes. It looked real plain spoken and informative until we used the book.It did not tell us that the parking brake had to be removed from the back brake caliper assembly! We figured that out on our own by many phone calls to the dealer service techs.Most of the book is an easy read and should help in your repair or maintence projects. Better having this book than running to the dealer every day.
1,garbage.,"I was expecting that what we would be seeing here was an illustrated and communicative version of a written novelette. What I found was a picture book showing me what I already know -- I was force-ably mutilated as a child without my permission. The only option I would have had was to read this ""children's book"" to my nephews, though they have already been mutilated, as well -- seems that this ""book"" is quite fraudulent and should be returned. Maybe this book is for boys that haven't been mutilated, though, even my partner, with a foreskin, said it was garbage. Save your money. Amazon had better give me all of my money back."
5,One of the best snacks Ive ever had!,"This sweet, nutty, sticky, messy (I personally think that adds to the experience) snacks are some of the best I've ever had, cashews and almonds hugged by soft maple tasting caramel, and it's a pleasure to chew! Ive tried all of the flavors and this is my personal favorite! And I tell all of my friends about it. It is particulatly good if you like the sweet richness of chocolate but arent intersted in all of the fat and calories. I dont understand what that person was complaining about. You really expect to buy something entitled ""chew"" and it not be sticky? yeah ok.I hope you will try the chews and like it too!"
2,Not worth the money,"I was really disappointed with this book. The cover says ""If you loved THE DA VINCI CODE, you'll flip over REVELATION.This book is nothing like the CODE. There is no mystery involved even though the author tries to make you believe it.I liked the characters in the novel. It's too bad the author didn't give them something more mysterious and interesting to do. Please don't buy this book if your looking for another page-turner like the CODE. This book is sorely lacking in great action and mystery that made the CODE so much fun."
2,"A ""Putter Downer""","This is a book that I really wanted to like, but after 50 pages found myself unmotivated to pick up. It kept sitting on my end table crying out, ""don't you have something better to do?"" I know this sounds silly, but it is really a quite accurate representation of how you will feel reading the book.The characters are hyperbolic and stereotypical, and generally unbelievable. The story is trite and predictable. The one good point about this book is that Christian Balling writes in a style that is easy to read. If Mr. Balling can provide his audience with more intriguing characters and plot, I think he will sell some books. Because of this, I gave the book 2 stars for writing style.I tend to be a reader that gives a book 50 pages before moving on. There are so many good books in the market to read that I am not anxious to spend more than 50 pages on an unforgettable novel. This was such a novel. I moved on to something else, and you will too."
5,"An intellegent, cinematic read","Contrary to the Book Review summation, I found this novel to be exceptionally well-written and entertaining, not to mention well-researched. Clearly the author has taken great pains to weave his tale in the most credible way possible. If one is to make any entertainment industry analogy at all, I could easily see this being made into a great feature film, not a TV movie. And, apparently I am not alone in thinking this, as the book jacket mentions that REVELATION has been optioned by Cannel Productions."
4,out of tune and beautiful,"acetone gets lots of velvet underground comparisons, but this first record reminds me of neil young's zuma more than anything else. it's a hazy l.a. summertime swelter with low production values and lots of magic. lyrical references to the velvets, the wailers, and olivia newton john aren't witty, they just make you feel like you heard this record in a dream when you were a child. but you didn't. it's only a decade old. there's calculated genius, and then there's this kind, the zuma kind: put a few musical minds together and see what their influences create unconsciously. only groundbreaking records deserve 5 stars, but the first track alone, ""come on"", warrants at least 4. not groundbreaking, cindy is just beautiful."
3,Pokémon League Finals,"This is the second half of the Pokémon League, and is sadly lacking when compared to the first. The majority of the volume relates to Ash's new friend Ritchie, with a copious amount of the battle episode devoted to another of Team Rocket's formulaic plots, resulting in a shortened battle. Plus, the following episode's 6 on 6 match is truncated for yet another Team Rocket scheme.Friends and Rivals contains the following episodes:A Friend in DeedFriend and Foe AlikeFriends to the EndSadly this does not live up to the hype set up by the previous volume (Pokemon - Round One (Vol. 25) [VHS]). If you're looking for good battles rather than story, buy that instead.This is worth getting, as it does contain the conclusion to the Pokémon League, but it's far from the best this series has to offer. If you're only looking for the best volumes, you might want to skip this one."
4,Informative little book that covers the basics of Paganism,"Just the basics in a concise format. Ms. Crowley addresses such subjects as: Pagan Beliefs, Deities, Holidays and the modern Pagan. This book should appeal to those who are curious and want their questions answered ""now"". It's one of the books I use and recommend as reading in my ""Introduction to Wicca"" classes"
1,not another one...,"oh dear. ms crowley seems to have missed the point somewhat. yeah, okay, so she has thrown in the basics. yeah, she touches base on most of the major topics of interest. unfortunately, in doing so, she shows her wiccan bias to the full. in a book like this one, the bias must be strictly non-specific, as it would otherwise violate the point. she puts forward the notion that 'all pagans' do certain things, but even the pagan federation can't find common enough ground for such statements.in general, it's wishy-washy, puerile, pointlessness in book form. i can ignore the wiccan bias (by now, i'm getting used to it) but i can't ignore innacurate information from a condescending child-psychologist type. there's many better books out there."
5,A Must for Marxism,"If you are looking to begin reading in Marxist theory and cultural critique, you MUST begin with Jameson's magesterial ""Marxism and Form."" It moves amazingly through the entire Western Marxist tradition, and gives a very nice introduction into each thinker. The book argues throughout that Marxist cultural criticism has hitherto only focused on the content of cultural texts but has ignored the form. Therefore, a properly dialectical analysis MUST account for the form of these texts. Jameson then conludes by offering his theory of a dialectical analysis that synthesizes all the theorists he introduces with his own theory of form."
2,These cards are a waste of time.,"I know everyone that has given U DECIDE a review has only raved about it, but I am here with a different opinion. These cards merely help you have an idea of what you want with your life. Basically, they don't tell you anything you shouldn't already know about yourself. If I were you, I'd save the money and spend it on something else."
4,a new twist on a proven decision making method,"Once you have used this system, you will find that not only are your goals and priorities in life more clear, but you will have the beginnings of a definite plan to achieve what you need and desire from life."
4,Finally found the song!,"There was a snippet of a song that I heard on an original episode of Due South (awesome show!) and I have been looking for it ever since. Finally found it on this album - The song is Cha Shookie Do. LOVE the music in this song!I only gave it a four star rating because I don't normally listed to blues and I really don't have any comparison for how Colin James & the Little Big Band rate in that category. However his regular fans give most of his albums a 5 star rating. I did like everything I heard, it is just not my regular cup of tea.It would be a Great album to dance Swing to!"
4,Highly Informative,"The Birth of Vietnam by Keith Weller Taylor is a must read for those who are into Vietnamese history because it covers in depth the rise and fall of dynasties such as, the Hong Bang, Au Lac, Trieu Da, Trung, Ba Trieu, Ngo, and Dinh, though the Trung and Ba Trieu were more like brief insurgencies rather than dynasties, and also the Chinese dynasties in Vietnam such as, the Qin, Han, Tang, Liang, Sung, Yuan (Khubilai Khan Mongols), and Ming. It also covers empires such as Funan, Chenla, and Lin I later called Champa, and the flowering of Buddhism in Vietnam. And since so much research went into the book, it makes a must read for Vietnamese history enthusiasts."
3,History compiler,"Exhaustive compilation of the record of how the Viet reacted to 1000 years of Sino rule. Good for an academic source, but the book does not make original strides. Author wants to make sense of his history as a veteran. I read it in anticipation of a trip there and it did give me an ancient sense of the culture i was about to engage in. Lots of emphasis on the dark side of history: beheadings, mass executions etc. The book is Ha` noi^. centric and deals with the 1000 years prior 936ad."
4,Nice Product,"Good taste & texture....nicely packaged with a gelatin topping. I liked this with some spicy mustard, a little onion, and accompanied with gherkins. Mmmmm for happy hour!"
5,In An Ideal World!,"For me it is difficult to understand how great music can not seem to remain ""in print."" I purchased this in the 70's as an LP when it first appeared in stores, and when the industry reissued it as a CD, I bought it immediately. I noticed that the CD is no longer available.It is a shame that creative material like this disappears so quickly. I heard David and Graham perform live, and their music has always been incredible. This album, if you can find it, is a ""must have"" for fans who appreciate their exceptional music."
5,Waited Forever,"This is one of the best Crosby Nash albums out there, and we waited forever for it, most likely because so much of it was covered on both box sets of these artists. Got tired of listening to my vinyl that was transferred to tape that was transferred to digital. This is much better."
3,Summer Of Learning Life's Lessons,"Set on a ranch in the Pampas Region of Argentina, director/screenwriter Andre Melancon details the lives of three children and their grandfather during a special summer together.The trio are pursuing different avenues - the youngest befriends a puppy, the 13-year-old sister struggles with leaving her childhood years behind - while David follows the trail of breaking and training his first horse.The cinematography is wonderful and - though the script is the typical coming-of-age, coming to grips with the end of life - the characters are believable.Released in 1989, it predates the re-emergence of the horse in Hollywood through successful Thoroughbred racing movies like Seabiscuit and Dreamer. The pace of Summer of the Colt is based on living on a farm, so it is a less-rapid race with life's lessons, as the ultimate timepiece ticks away."
2,PVM,The story was okay. The quality of the images was poor. I hope that there will be a remastering of this disk?
1,horrible movie,"I baught it because I like hoeses and then watched it. The boy gives up on training the horse, this movie is horrible and only somewhat entertaining. the only part that i like is the pretty horse, it is not verry ""kid like"" and If I could give it 0 stars I would"
5,Excellent buy,This workbook was like new. My student could not afford to buy one from the local literacy council so I was happy to find one on line.
2,Movie Moves Really Slowly,"I love that it is about the lives of two sisters, but like I said in my title the movie is so slow. I don't recommend this movie to anyone unless you have patience."
5,Unbelievable buy!,"I can't believe the price of these sneakers!! They are wonderful, my son loves them!"
5,The humidifier arrived when promised and was a direct replacement for my old unit.,The humidifier was delivered on schedule and was just as advertised. The installation was simple as it was a direct replacement for the old unit that I had.
3,Watch out when you remove the cover !!,"I recently purchased a townhome with one of these installed. I purchased a new water pad, and upon trying to remove the cover on the unit, it went flying and crashed onto the floor. Granted, this is model 700 from 2005, but luckily it still seems to be operating. It seems the cover is very top-heavy in my opinion. I'm skilled with HVAC equipment, but was surprised at such a poor design. I mounted a label on the unit to remind myself next time I try to remove the cover."
5,Aprilaire Model 700 Humidifier,"Good quality humidifer but requires a 120 VAC outlet so be prepared. Took a few minutes to understand exactly how the rear housing frame mates to the duct opening. Must install the humdifier controller in the return duct upstream from the fresh air intake which required rerouting my fresh air intake. Also installed the Aprilaire Model 8570 Thermostat using a separate 24 VAC transformer. My furnance could not supply enough current from it's 24 VAC humidifier accessory terminal to run the humidifier. Aprilaire recommends not using the accessory terminal when installing the Model 8570 Thermostat so I already purchased the 24 VAC transformer. Pleased with both the 8570 Thermostat and Model 700 Humidifer. Like the ability to monitor outdoor temperature and humidity from the thermostat, and automatically control humidifier operation based on outdoor temperature because I have wooden casement windows. You will need some skills to install this unit."
1,Horrible Purchase,This is worse then having no humidifier as it breaks down and can overflow n flood into the HVAC unit.Worked for two months then pad flooded one year.Relay went out another year.Now solenoid valve is broken and quote is 350 to fix.Would suggest going with another brand that offers at least a 10 year warranty period or go with stand alone units.
1,can't keep up,"I've had this humidifier since the house was built 3 years ago. It simply doesn't provide any humidity. Separate readings show I'm at 20-27% throughout the winter. This unit can't keep up with a 4000 sq ft house. nose bleeds, dry skin, 3 separate (non-furnace) systems, and tons of lotion! The humidistat that they installed with it, kicks on and off loudly and frequently. The humidifier was supposed to work even when the furnace was not active as long as I ran my fan. I loved this option but it's never actually worked. Aprilaire--not. rename them to Superdryaire.Bottom line, if you have a big home, look for another company who makes a better top of the line product."
4,Wonderful!,This is a powerful little book packed with more information than some of the larger books I have purchased. I am glad I bought it.
2,E-Book Misbehaves,"This book downloaded without a cover (just a white rectangle - no title). Often it fails to open, though if I first open and close another book and come back to it, it will open. So far, the content is interesting and funny."
1,Wow - really bad,"I can't believe I just read through five short stories about Christmas and did not find a romantic one in the bunch! Or a funny one, either. If you want some fun, romantic regency Christmas stories, read some of the earlier regency Christmas anthologies - they are much better."
3,Just semi-OK,"I use my Acecad virtually every day for note-taking, and love the ability to store a digital image ofmy notes, but the OCR leaves a lot to be desired. As a result, I don't use the OCR as much as I had intended.Actually, it may not be entirely the fault of the software.. A lot of the problem is that people don't alwaystake the time to write exactly the way that they did when training it, get in a hurry, get a littlesloppy in forming letters. The program reads your writing and makes its best guess at what you wrote, but Ihave no idea where it gets some of the words that it uses. I use a lot of technical terms, and would love to be able toadd some type of custom word list of my own to its program, but so far I have not found how to do that, so I don't use the OCR much.If there was a way to correct the words and have the software remember and learn from the corrections, this would be a much betterproduct."
2,not very accurate,"I ordered this to use for work and as instructed spent time training the software to recognize my writing. When I tested on some randome notes I took while reading a book, it managed about 75% accuracy. Not great but someting I could live with. At my first meeting, I took six pages of notes, some with charts and graphs, none of these complicated. When I plugged it in at home I found two pages were completely missing and the charts were unreadable. For instance a triangle with printed text on each corner came back as a long word with a number 11 in the middle. Took me a minute to realize the 11 represented the sides of the triangle, not good considering the triangle took up 5 lines on the paper.The pen works as advertised. The software to turn it into editable text works as long as you don't mind really heavy editing. I decided taking notes on a laptop was much easier and returned the pen, pad, and software for a full refund. At least that was easy. Thank you Amazon!"
1,edserve,"I was very disappointed as this software ONLY works with Digimemo, and no other graphic tablets. I have a Cyberpad and I spent much time trying to get it to work--it didn't. Also, help from the maker, Vision Objects, is non-existent."
5,Very Good,The item is just want I need to get my job done fast. Thank you for getting it to me in a timely manner.
4,Very good at the one thing it does,"It's not as good as the Windows tablet native recognition, that's clear to me. But it has multilanguage support right out of the box. It also increases the DigiMemo's value tremendously.Do note that it's not so precise figuring out my cursive handwriting but you should get better results if you write clearly. My handwriting is not as bad as a doctor's but I'm certainly no model of caligraphy."
1,I am looking for an alternative,Being in the software business I have to rate this product very low. Instructions are poor at best. Training is a disaster.For training - the software does not start you out by going thru training exercise. You have to hunt thru the drop down menus to find it. Training instructions start with some suggested samples - later you find out that these are not samples but what you are actually supposed to input to train the software. Punctuation is included - all punctuation.I have yet to achieve enough samples to get the rating required to get it to recognize my hand printing. Actually the OCR did pretty good w/o training and I am using it in that fashion until I get a better OCR package.The included extras are worthless. The design-it-lite that is supposed to work requires a key that needs to be purchased. What's the point?
1,good story bad quality tape,"sweet story for pre-teen and teenage girls, but the sound quality was awful. popping, hissing and static throughout the video."
5,One of the best horse movies ever!,"I love this movie. I am a great horse fan. I ride and jump, this movie was one of the reason why I started to ride. I think there aren't enough showing jumping movies, it's all racing (which is okay) This is the best movie to whatch if you love horses and showing jumping. I would love to get to that ultimate goal of competing at the olimpics. This movie is something that pushes me that extra bit further to completing that goal. I would recomend it to anyone!!!"
3,Big Mon,"At first, before I listened to it, this CD sounded like it would be really great. I was a little disappointed, though. There are about three memorable songs. These would include Dolly Parton's ""Cry Cry Darlin"", Patty Loveless on ""Close By"", and Travis Tritt on ""My Little Georgia Rose.""All in all, this CD is OK."
2,Not quite,"I disliked this album. It seems top-heavy and bloated; more of a chance for all these stars to show how ""down with"" Bill Monroe they are, when in fact they aren't really playing these songs much in the Monroe tradition at all. Yeah, sure, we can't begrudge modern artists the chance to put their personal stamp on old music, but this too-perfect studio style doesn't reach me emotionally. I'd rather just listen to some old bluegrass, or to new bands like the Crooked Jades or Jim & Jennie who still have some of the clattersome, old-time fire to their picking & plunking."
5,Hidden gems for your bluegrass collection,"The real hidden treasure on here is the Bill Monroe tune ""Used To Be"". The Whites do a fine job, sounds like Ricky on fiddle, Jerry Douglas and the White family or Buck White and the Down Home folks all over again. Buck shows his taste on the mandolin and there is a bass solo. By the way the original tune only had one verse and chorus. I believe the Whites had done this song for years and many folks have wondered about the second verse and second bridge. My guess is that the Whites wrote it."
4,"3.5 stars - some songs are 5, some are a lot less","Uneven album - I was looking for more traditional bluegrass readings of Bill Monroe's repertoire. But some, like Blue Moon (rocked nicely by John Fogerty), were almost too far afield for me. Others don't work well at all for me, like Bruce Hornsby's redone melody on Darling Corey. It should sound as mournful as its lyrics.I like Ricky Skaggs' versions of Bill Monroe songs on Big Mon. But his live album with Kentucky Thunder is better. It contains some Bill Monroe cover tunes that sound more modern without losing the bluegrass roots integrity.I'm a little disappointed with the album overall, but may come back to it for 3 or 4 songs."
4,Fresh Renditions of Faded Beauty,"As much as I love Bill Monroe's own work, I like these fresh, updated versions even better. With this collections of tunes that are at times touching and at others infectiously happy, Ricky Skaggs has made yet another stride in drawing the masses to an essential component of American music history. Every song on this CD (excepting for Mary Chapin Carpenter's version of Blue Night) rings with appeal both tangy and twangy. If you close your eyes as you listen, it's not too hard to imagine yourself on the front porch of a little shack somewhere down in an Appalachian hollow."
5,Feeling better,I can tell a big difference of how feel when I am taking this product and when I am not. Works as advertised. A good replacement for perscription pills that have so many side effects.
5,How's it hanging?,Good quality product...arrived on time with all the necessary parts and is now doing a good job of holding up my curtains.
2,Difficult to install,"No instructions, feel miserable to install. Can find a two-dollar one in the dollar store. I do not recommend it."
1,A disappointment,"I am a huge Ian Gillan fan and I was very disappointed after recieving this double cd set. CD 1 is the Gillan / Glover ""Accidentally On Purpose"" album which I do like . The second cd is a waste except for the 2 Ian Gillan Naked Thunder songs . The remainder of the songs are old Roger Glover solo songs . If I was just rating the ""Accidentally On Purpose"" cd , I'd give this set a 3 , but cd 2 brings everything down to a 1 . AVOID THIS !!!"
3,Early work from a future talent,"Susan Howatch is now a fantastic writer. When she wrote April's Grave, she was working in different genre. It's a good book in the tradition of Victoria Holt, Barbara Michaels, Phyllis Whitney. She doesn't quite make it to their level, but it's a solid read anyway. It reflects the time in which it was written and makes for a nostalgic read now."
1,not for kindle,"I can't say anything about the non kindle book, but the kindle version is unreadable. Whenever there is a german letter that english doesn't have, a random symbol is put in its place."
3,just an OK film,It arrived on time and it was in great quility and packaged well.I dont know what else to say so best wishes for the New Year!
3,"Hmmm, well, it's interesting...",The story line is very hard to believe with characters doing ridiculous things that left me feeling like my intelligence was being repeatedly insulted. I liked the WWI flashback scenes which were well acted and filmed and found that I was far more interested in knowing more about the deceased grandfathers story than those of the main characters. Unless you can buy this for next to nothing...save your money for something better.
1,Ouch! couldn't make it through this one.,"I was introduced to Melanie Rawn through the Dragon Prince trilogy which I had received as a gift one year. I only made it through the first book before vowing never again to touch another by this author. Well, to my shame, I broke my vow and bought this book. I didn't make it all the way through. I found it difficult to follow and boring with an erratic pace. The background history is not interesting and without anything to interest the reader the temptation is there to skip entire sections, which unfortunately, while it will preserve the reader's mental health, it will leave him totally lost. Don't spend your money on this book."
5,The best book,"I am 11 years old and I read this book in 3 days. It was the best book ever. The second book was not as good but is a must read if u have read this book.Um if u r for some reason against the use of ""cussing"" I wouldnt read this book."
4,an adventure with heart,i love these books.the people in them actually have lives outside of the numerouse battles and confuseing politics.i also love that you watch each one of the main charecters grow into adulthood so they come alive to you.iadmire melanie's great imagination and the strength she put's into her work.
5,A Beautiful begenning to an awesome series!,"It's the whole package; love, magic, and a split family fighting for the way the earth-or should I say, Lenfell, is supposed to be. This wonderful, intertwined plot never leaves you with questions that should've been answered, although the suspense and mystery remain! Not only do you get to know the characters, you meet them. Ms. Rawn desctibes everything from thoughts to feelings to flowers in this amazing, unpredictable start to the best series I've ever read."
5,Rawn does it to me again!,"When I read Melanie Rawn's first Dragon trilogy, I did nothing till the end of the third book but read; I could not put it down. Same with the second trilogy. When I saw that she had another one started, I deliberately waited until the second book in the set came out before starting. This book was well worth the wait. Rawn is an author can totally captivate you, involving you in the epic before you by the middle of the second page. Hurry up with the third one, Melanie!"
5,Exiles Volume 1: The Ruins of Ambrai,"This is the only book I have read of Melanie Rawn. (I haven't gotten around to the second book.) I only picked it up because it was the thickest book I could find and also the only interesting book. I was amazed at the complexity of the society. It had so much depth to it, down to society structure, family structure and religion. I am an avid reader, but this is by-far one of the most detailed and well-thought out books I have read. I would recomend it to everyone!"
5,5 million stars,"I read this book and it's sequal for the first time three years ago, and loved it, but got tired of waiting for the third book to come out. Recently I read the Golden Key, and the title of the third book in this series was mentioned, so I figured it would be coming out soon. I re-read the first two books in this series, and loved them even more than the first time! Of coarse, I also found out the third book won't be coming out for another two years.*sigh* I guess I'll just have to read them again untill the third book comes out. :-)"
1,The cover is the best thing about this!,"The first 2 pages were great!! Unfortunatley, the next 800 or so were extreemly boring. I kept on reading, hoping to find some justification for speding 8 odd dollars.....well, atleast i got a picture of a beautiful woman......"
1,To much politics and to little prose!,"As a long time fan of Melanie Rawn, I am sorely dissapointed in Exiles. The plot not only has to many twists and turns to keep even the most dedicated reader engrossed. Character development is extremely poor and takes a back burner position to political development.And speaking of politics, I for one do not think it mixes well with fantasy, and Rawn proves my point.I must be honest, and I only made it 3/4 of the way through the book and I do not know the outcome or ending. And I must also inform people that I began the book 5 times before I decided to sit down and read it. It lacks the spark of the Dragon Prince novels.To many characters, too many plots and subplots, too little character development, too much political machinations and no spirit! Altogether, theses qualities make for a very poorly created book!"
2,Long ans Slow,I'm surprised at how high this book is rated. I didn't find it to be a terrible book. The main characters were fairly interesting but I would of thought a book of over eight hundred pages would have alot more going on inside. I found it very slow. Maybe the author knowing she was writing a trilogy was just laying groundwork here but I was not interested enough to purchase the next book.
1,Thuroughly disappointed,"I came to know Rawn through her ""Dragon"" books, and I would easily give 5 stars to every one of them. However, I was saddened when I opened this book. I found it to be very hard to follow, and rather uninteresting. None of the characters caught my attention, and I quite often got totally lost in the political structre. Maybe someday I'll crack it open again and try to re-read it, but I never made it more than halfway through before putting it down."
5,Highly Recommended,"A friend gave me book 2 of this series saying ""oh you don't have to read them in any order"" :P. couldnt follow it at all so i took book 1 from the library and barely read 5 chapters before i went and bought it. i ADORE her sense of humour! The politics and heritage can get a little longwinded and she has several ""steamy"" type sections but nothing overly much... but all of it is sprinkled with a refreshing sense of humour that kept me laughing out loud throughout. I got VERY attached to the characters. She has an annoying habit of killing off all your favorite characters though... and some things are a little too ""far out"" to believe, tending to use magic as an excuse for everything. But this IS a fantasy book right? what fun is it if it's all believable hehe. I highly recommend it, but it probably won't be for everyone and Women will probably enjoy it more than Men will (not saying that men won't.. but all my male friends snorted a bit about it :P)"
4,I was surprised,"When I read the first page or so of Ruins of Ambrai, I was intrigued by it. It didn't make sense to me at first, and that caused me to put the book down a few times.Anyway, when I did get into it, it became interesting after those first few pages. I really enjoyed this book and I am thinnking about getting the other two books in this series."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Slogged my way through the other series because they were around, but the girly factor in this one was too high to manage to finish. My sister had them, this was the only reason, and unfortunately they did not get any better. Clearly written to appeal to the romance angle I think, which is not my thing. If you like that, and fantasy, this might be a sure thing for you."
2,This book was boring!,"I didn't like the magic system - why should some people get to be born with magic and others not? Its just not fair. The entire book seemed devoid of any action. If you like to read exciting books, skip this one!"
4,The Exiles,"I have not begun this book, but I have begun the first one. I would like to know when the third one is coming out."
1,"Too long , one dimensional characters","I found the world of exiles interesting if not very original. But the story was very slow, and the characters are not very well worked."
4,worth reading :),"Lenfel and its many inhabitants cast a spell on the reader. The well-developed plotline keeps you interested throughout, especially the scenes where Collan and Sarra want to kill eachother. It's definately worth your time. A friend recommended this to me, I saw it...and bought it without a second thought. The first few chapters left me a little reluctant to continue, but I read the whole thing and loved it. It's one of my favorite books, even though two of my favorite characters died. My very favorite character (and thankfully, a surviving one) was Lady Lilen's cactus. I've read the second book and am eagerly awaiting the third."
3,true fact,"No manual or driver cd included. You will have to go online to the company website to download everything you need for this device. Aside from this, picture and video quality is okay, not great. Overall, this webcam is somewhat decent for the price."
4,A good book.... but not a international law bible,"Ian brownlies'principles is a good survey of international law, but don't expect a full overview of international law. It lacks some deep exploration some parts, but well it is a principle book.At last: its a survey about some of the main instituts of international law, in a direct, objective style of writting.PS: For non common law student's, this is a basic, very basic course with some good points."
4,Good grief,"This book is a gem. Written by a reporter who was herself widowed at a young age, it contains her interviews with various other young widows. Lacking melodrama or maudlin tendencies, the book instead takes an empathetic, clear-eyed look at death and its ramifications. Whether they're struggling through grief while trying to feed a gaggle of youngsters or simply trying to help those kids deal with their own sense of loss, these women are examples of courage to any young widow in need of a kind, honest friend. Unfortunately, the book is no longer in print, and very hard to track down."
3,er,First Season is one of the best. Double sided discs are a bad idea. Anybody who wants to call and complain to them can call (818)954-7165 or (818)954-6000. If enough of us complain maybe they will change the format and give er the respect and quality it deserves.
5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE ER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love er so much. I love Laura Innes, I love Goran Visnjic, I love them ALL!!!!! OMG, this will be the best DVD ever made!!!! I can't wait. I miss Anthony Edwards though. =-( He was the best actor ever. The episode ""The Letter"" made me cry for a long time. I love ER!!!!!!!!! I hope that they make a season 2-8 DVD collection too!!!!!!!"
5,Very Watchable!,"This is a very rare gem that is only found on television once a decade. However, this is not for everybody. You are bombarded with dozens of storylines every episode, some of which go somewhere, some that don't. It's more a ""day in the er"" show. The camera work is absolutely brilliant. You feel like you are infact walking through the ER yourself, getting to know these people from the conversations. You find yourself picking up medical worlds that you never knew you could learn. It deos come off as very real. Yes, there are some indescrepencies between an real ER and the show but thank goodness there are!"
3,Surprised,I love ER but was not pleased that each episode was priced at 2.99. I watched one episode and decided to forego watching more due to the cost. I thought it was 2.99 per season.
5,What a Show!,"ER has long been my favorite television series, even though I was very young when it first appeared on TV I loved being able to go back and enjoy it over and over again."
5,We need a ER dvd....why can't we have one.,For the past nine years ER has been the #1 drama on t.v. and when friends is gone ER will be the #1 show. I just started watching ER two years ago and I live in canada so I can't get tnt to watch the re-runs. I have been hooked on ER ever since i watched my first episode(be still in my heart). In europe and japan they have three seasons of er on dvd...but we don't have region 2 dvd players.my final statement is why is there will and grace dvds when we still don't have and ER season 1 dvd?
5,As good as it gets from a real ER doc,"As an ER physician, I've never been impressed with TV medical dramas. Shows like Chicago Hope were too sentimental, unrealistic, and fitting for day-time soap opera fans.""ER"" is an amazing show. It's hard, edgy, and gives a great insider's view into all the difficulties and hardships that ER physicians face both professionally and personally. The characters are compelling without being overly dramatic.I find the pace of the show exhilirating and I'm impressed with the close attention to detail of the clinical cases. They are a medical students dream for learning medicine."
3,DVD's not as good as they could be,"The 3 stars are not a judgment on the series, but on the penny pinchers at WB. First the 4 disc are double sided so no cover art on the discs (unlike other tv series DVDs, so look generic and cheap ), and no way of telling which episodes are on which discs unless you look at the booklet. The little inner circle where it is printed, (in my opinion) are mislabeled. The side that says ""Side A"" is side A, so when you pull out that first DVD, you have to flip it over to watch the first episode, instead of putting it into the DVD player the way you pulled it out. Also NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES, only French. The video transfer and sound looks and great."
4,"Great Series, love the Anamorphic wide screen","Why does a series made for TV on widescreen only play as a distored full screen on some players? Why are the subtitles only offered in French. Don't the designers of features realize that an English speaking audience just might have hearing problems and need the substitles. Get with it. At least offer it in English and then add in French and Spanish. Most do.Stories, picture quality when the player isn't forcing it to full screen, is very good. Enjoyed seeing the earlier stories again even if I can't hear everything. I guess I'll just have to live with the volume turned up and hope I don't miss too many words."
5,It's about time!!!,I have been waiting a long time for this television series to be released onto dvd/video. I have been an avid fan since the pilot first aired 9 years ago. I can watch this show over and over again (special help with reruns on TNT network) and now with the seasons coming out on dvd/video (hopefully more seasons very soon) I can watch my favorite episodes repeatedly!!
4,"I really like the show,","specially the first and second season. However, the first season does not provide English subtitle, only French."
5,Perfect!,"Not much to say other than this was the only season we were lacking to complete our ER set.Loved it of course.........watched it in one weekend.However, we do love ER."
3,Stopped working,"The item arrived as promised. However, after watching the first disc at around chapter 5 the disc stopped working. I haven't vied the others because I haven't had time. More to come if the others have the same issue. Very disappointed. I will never buy if it doesn't come directly from amazon. Lessons learned."
5,"At Long Last, DVD","Glory hallelujah, hooray, to say nothing of, what took them so long to get this wonderful show on DVD?The DVD release of ER is a long time in coming. What a thrill it will be to see George Clooney, Anthony Edwards, and company in the show that brought them to public greatness.In my opinion, Love's Labor Lost is the one episode that helped to solidify this series as must-see TV."
4,Good read,"Important information if you are in debt try reading it, it might help. I had a hard time reading it all the way through but the info was great."
4,Because women need this help,"I have given this book four stars because women need to be focused on their finances, in any way shape or form!"
4,GOOD SONGS FOR q-cHORD,"There isn't much to be said here. This is a good selection, but not perfect. It is good to have ""demo"" songs handy to play on your Q-Chord. People seem to like these songs. The instruments are fine, and the rhythms mostly are OK. I enjoy the extra rhythm card even more. These cartridges are probably worth the money, although its pretty expensive on a ""per song"" basis. Nevertheless, I may buy another selection or two. The Suzuki Q-Chord is so much fun, and so easy to make sound ""good"" on your own, that you may, like me, just enjoy making your own music most of the time."
5,Religious Standards,The music on this song cartridge is very fun to listen to and play along with. Great selections and we'll use over and over.
4,A good introduction to several artistic traditions,"This book is an engaging, well-illustrated, readable introduction to several Jordanian artistic traditions. While not a book for serious researchers (it's a little too general if you have expertise in a specific area), it's an excellent starting point. Many of the chapters have been written by recognized experts in their fields, such as Michele Piccirillo's esasy on mosaics. Other topics addressed include sculpture, pottery, writing, costume, and folk jewelry. It's nice to see a book about Jordanian art, an area of the Near East that is so often overlooked."
4,Victorian Doctor,"Nothing but action in this one, as the few of these novilizations I have read so far all seem to be. Not quite so fantastic a plot as those others, in this one the fourth Doctor is off to Victorian London. A talented magician and his animated manikin assistant, both in the employ of a Chinese god, serve as the Doctor's foes in this one.The Doctor's companion is Leela and a local pathologist and theater manager provide the assist. As with the other novilizations the book is focused on plot and does not provide much insight into the characters thoughts. I found it an entertaining read and as it is reasonably short, it can be read in only a couple hours, providing an evening's enjoyable entertainment."
2,Over-priced Toddler Toy,"This is like a nice Fischer Price toy for babies but is usually targeted and marketed towards Autistic children. Although all Autistic children differ and are unique, I have three of them and they basically couldn't care less for this toy. I found it over advertised, overpriced, and quite boring myself. Turn it one way and the cheap little plastic beads fall to the bottom, tilt it the other way, same thing. I suppose if you are 1-2 years old you may enjoy this but it may be too big for that age group as they more than likely would clunk themselves in the head with it so I don't really know what it's purpose would be. Perhaps some child out there somewhere may find it entertaining but advertised as an audio type toy for Autistic children is just making money off from parents with disabled children. Shame on you companies that are doing this! This should simply be advertised as a toddler toy, period! And $7.99 - $9.99, not $20!"
2,"Boring content, poor delivery",I rented this video on Amazon's Unbox service. The content itself feels like it was made in the 60s with boring graphics and little educational content. The Unbox experience was also less than smooth.
1,"Easy no, patterns no, waste money yes","Quilts for Baby: Easy As ABCThe book has wonderful looking quilts.The patterns are non existent. until the book is in your hands do you realize she takes short cuts and uses printed fabrics, not cut patterns for the center of the squares.I was disappointed horribly when receiving this book and will gladly pass it along to someone that may have more access to the fabrics the writer uses. Because finding pre-printed fabrics is time consuming and very costly. The average I found was around $16.00 USD per yard.Misleading title: I should add, easy is not the word I would use for these quilts either, unless you are a quilter with years of experience.Since I am not a quilter with years of experience the easy part seem to be only in the head of the author."
5,"a must have if you enjoy ""quick and dirty""",This is my THIRD copy of Quilts for Baby. The first one I gave away. The second one got some water damage and the pages stuck together. This one I've loaned to my guild's charity bee. We make lots of charity quilts for children and always need ideas for the remnants that are donated. This books makes everything easier if you don't feel like being creative. Sometimes you just want someone else to tell you what to do. I really can't imagine Quilts for Baby not being in my quilt book library!
5,Quilts for babies Easy as ABC,This is a very good book for basic quilting It was a used book and it came in new condition Very pleased. I especially liked the step by step review.
3,A good beginners book,"10+ quilts - based on simple piecing squares and novelty fabrics. A good beginners book but not what I was looking for. Reikes shows how simple patterns coupled with novelty and patterened fabrics create an eye-catching quilt, including a number of variations on quilts by simply varying the colour scheme.- Includes excellent how-to and what-is descriptions for the beginner.- Covers basic one-patch, framed one-patch, four-patch, rail fence, log cabin, log cabin with dominant centre square, courthouse steps, hourglass, friendship star, shoo fly, esy attic windows."
2,Too much patterned fabric,This is a good book but it would be easier to pick out a blanket pattern if the pictured blankets used more solid fabric. Some of the colors are bright and fun but the quilt pattern is lost in all the crazy fabric. It gets to be too much and all the patterns start looking the same.
5,Spectacular Results with Ease,"I have made many of the quilts from this book. I second all the comments made by the first reviewer. I wanted to add that any of these quilts can be expanded to make lap size quilts or bigger by increasing the amounts of fabrics. Any experienced quilter could make these quilts without these directions but save yourself time and follow these very explicit, very well written directions. Cutting directions and piecing directions are well thought out. Don't think of these as just baby quilts. Use more sophisticated colors for lap quilts or even bed quilts. I've recommended this book to many quilters over the years."
4,bracelet,"I love the the color and the style. This product was actually for my toddler but when I received it, it was too small for her chunky, arm. So I decided to give it to a friend, she loved it and receives compliments on the bracelet all the time.[...], [...][...], [...]"
3,Entertaining but...,"The first story was good, even though the acting sucked. The second one, I had no idea what it had to do with horror. It was about a guy whose daughter was kidnapped and demanded 30,000 yen. Then he kidnapped his friend's kid and pretended to be the kidnapper, demanding 50,000 yen. He abandoned the child at a child's center, run by nuns. When they returned for the child, the nuns told him that the child had passed away due to pneumonia. The third story was my favorite. I would recommend this to people who enjoy Japanese films, only because of the third story."
1,returned -damaged,"This item was returned due to scuffs and scratches that seemed to happen during the shipping process. It was NOT packaged well. Since it was whie, it should have had a protective plastic over it. It did not."
2,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of renaissance instrumental music, and since these are dances, I was expecting some pleasant, spirited melodies, like on the excellent English Country Dances. Although there are several tracks like this on this CD, many are slow and dirgy. These, combined with the tracks with soprano vocals, make one feel as if they were in church, which is not a bad thing, if that's what you're looking for."
1,Vanishing color,"This vase was a big disappointment. The color comes from a foil on the vase that washes off with water. This was not mentioned in the description. The vase may be fine for dry decor but not for real flowers that need water. After the first flower and rinse, the entire blue foil came off. This is such a flaw in a vase that at the minimum, it should be mentioned in the product description."
5,Big help for milk production & prompt seller,"Like most women buying Fenugreek, I am breastfeeding and don't produce quite enough milk for my baby. We went and saw a lactation specialist and this is the exact bottle she sold us for $10, so it is a little cheaper here. I do notice a significant difference in quantity of milk when I take this as well as if I stop. It looks like, that for me, as long as I want to breastfeed - I will be taking this. I wish that this could be set up on ""subscription"" with Amazon mom and that way I wouldn't have to remember to order ahead of time. The seller is pretty quick so that hasn't been too much of an issue and has checked in with me to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. That being said, this is where I will continue to order."
2,Enough about your news letter,"When I started reading the book I thought ok this might be decent. I agree zero down is another real estate tool. But did we have to beat a dead horse for 7 chapters? But then he ties this together with his ploys at trying to get you jacked up with the ""I'm a Millionare and you can be one too!"" lines. I wouldnt buy this book because he recommends you buy his news letter 10 times a chapter. In addition, he pitches that he can finance some of your loans. Again not all bad but, how many times do I need to hear that he has money to loan you.I ended up getting more out of the bullet points at the end of the chapters then actually reading the book. Sorry."
4,Very Informative!,"I agree with the other reviewers, this book was very informative and really drives home that it is important to begin building real estate rental assets. I was really excited and eager to get started after reading it, thank you.I also recommend ""How to Make Fast Cash in Real Estate with No Money Down Deals!"" by: Rod L. Griffin, it is very creative."
5,Awesome!!,"Danielia is HOT new artist, with such a variety in her music it is refreshing. She is a soulful, hard rocker! :) I saw her perform and she did AC/DC's ""Back in Black,"" almost better than AC/DC themselves, and then did Hendrix! Of course all the music that night was her own, and it was amazing. I HIGHLY suggest this CD because it is amazing! I can't wait to hear more from this awesome talent! Go Danielia!"
1,Poor Introductory Text,"This text can hardly qualify as a reference for any purpose. It is not technical enough for academics and scholars and not accurate enough for practitioners. It is utterly useless save some funny typos, such as internet rates instead of interest rates.There are better alternatives from Fabozzi, Tuckman and Jarrow."
3,it's alright,"you get to see john cena, samoa joe, frankie kazarian, and others before their breaks...i bought this to learn moves, but found out i was in a better position when i went to a wrestling school...i recommend this video for entertainment only and not to try them of course...only basics are shown"
3,Great product for a short while,"Keeps our cats safe while outdoors. Most of the construction is very good. The frame and the netting are strong enough to contain our 18 pound tom and his housemates. We were very happy for about a year. But in year two (after leaving it outside over the snowy winter) the woven cord used to tie the netting to the frame suffers from dry rot. In many places it has snapped and the netting is coming away from the frame, especially on the door where the netting is under more stress.We eventually bought some parachute cord from the local army/navy store and repaired the broken areas. I expect we'll have to completely replace the woven cord eventually.This year we're bringing everything inside for the winter."
2,Great Idea In Theory,"I bought this for my house cat so that she can enjoy the outdoors in safety. While the kittywalk is a good idea in theory it just didn't work for us. My cat is rather large and strong. She walked into the kitty walk and proceded to figure out a way to escape. She ripped through it and ran off into our backyard in a matter of minutes. I got her back safe and sound, but how she managed to widen the mesh enough to get out I'll never know. Maybe someone else will have better luck."
5,Kittywalk Cat Run Comments,It is the best purchase I have made recently. Our cats (2) love it and sit in it for hours. We have to bribe them to come in at night. We have it set up so they can walk in or out of the livingroom into the back yard at their choice. A great babysitter.
2,Not for the feisty cat!,"I have two 2-year-old cats and wanted them to be able to go outside safely. They got used to the kittywalk immediately in the house and started rough-housing in it, on it, over it!!! They got their claws stuck in the netting, but mind you my cats are quite active. I could tell that if they saw a chipmunk when outside, the kittywalk would be topsy-turvy! I had to return it. I do think for a sedate cat who just likes to ""hang"" it would be very nice."
3,Expensive for what it is,"For $24 more than what the price of this tiny enclosure was (at the time), I was able to get a large metal Kitty Condo with two levels and plenty of room to jump around, sheepskin covered napping areas, and her kitty grass, water bowl and a small litter box fits perfectly inside with room for her to walk around. I live in an apartment with a balcony and I wanted to provide a safe way for her to be outside. The Kittywalk enclosure is too small and she couldn't even jump in it, which is all she wants to do outside because she sees so many birds. The kitty condo I bought was $129 at the pet store and the Kittywalk deck and patio walkway thing was $105 at the time. It would probably be fine if it was attached to the extra stuff, but who can afford to pay hundreds of dollars for all the pieces and not even know for sure it will hold up to their cat?"
2,Great until it busted!,"I only used this a few times and this morning as it was sitting in my dining room and my cat was going in and out of it, it suddenly collapsed. At first I thought the rod had just come out but in looking at it closer, the end pieces on both sides had busted off. I kept it right by my sliding patio door so when the weather was nice I'd slide it outside for my kitty, and then bring it back in. I live in a townhouse, so I didn't want to leave it outside when he wasn't using it, but I also didn't want to take the rods out and fold it up all the time either. I was surprised at how much my cat enjoyed sitting outside in it, so I'm not sure what I'm going to do now, but I'm much disappointed it did not hold up better."
2,Confusing and boring,Depressing book about sadistic people. Not a book I want influencing my children. Not everything that is available to put between your ears is worth storing there.
4,Early Fellini,"This is a glorious trasfer of one of Fellini's earliest films. This film is much more simple and light than many of Fellini's subsequent films, but it has a charm all of its own. The fairly straightforward story holds very few surprises or twists, but it also a nice exploration of fantasy vs. reality. The introduction of the White Sheik sitting in his swing, high in the air is a wonderful moment. As the film goes on, the dashing sheik just becomes to us an overweight and vain man and our illusions, like the young wife's, are dashed. Variations of this story have been done many times, but this is one of the most pure and enjoyable.The film is also notable for the introduction of Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) who would have her own Fellini film a few years after. It's not a very long scene, and it is included in its entirety on the ""Nights of Cabiria"" DVD by Criterion. Despite that, this is still a DVD worth owning to watch a master filmmaker get used to his craft."
3,A nice beginning work by Fellini,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""The White Shiek"" known in Italian as ""Lo Sceicco Bianco"" is Federico Fellini's solo directorial debut, and his second overall film.I found the film somewhat melodramatic but it has some humor in it. In the film a recently married couple go on a homeymoon in Rome. They have a tight schedule and the wife wants to meet ""The White Sheik"" the performer in a photo strip cartoon. When they meet, marital infidelity is suspected.The only special feature on the DVD is a set of interviews with two actors and a Fellini biographer.While it is a nice film, it would likely be appreciated more by those especially interested in Fellini's work."
5,Still a great CD,"I'm only here because I lost my original disc. More than 10 years later this disc remains one of my favorite to listen to. Do yourself a favor, but this CD, throw the disc in, put on a good pair of headphones, close your eyes and get lost in the music! I hear different things every time I listen to it!"
2,poor packaging,"This package was glass jars inside a big box. Too few air pockets, the jars were rolling around in the box. Glass, and it's not packaged correctly! I checked each jar, but they seem to be very sturdy. The taste of the product was a little dry, bland and not very nutty. I won't purchase them again. I'll try another brand."
4,Nuts are great!,"I liked the nuts very much, even gave some away as gifts. They could use a little more salt though."
3,Just plain nuts!,"Shoot! I should have known better.We like cashews a lot both for eating and for cooking. For years and years, our cashews have come from the food co-op bulk bin. When I noticed Amazon's rebate special, the price seemed good, the dry roasted variety sounded good, and I ordered.It just never entered my slow-witted naive little mind that these ""dry-roasted for natural flavor. . . wholesome"" nuts would also contain MSG, cornstarch, gelatin, corn syrup solids and other unspecified "" spices and natural flavor."" Sheesh.It's good of Amazon to include the nutrition table, but I would have appreciated seeing the ingredients as well. I may be just plain nuts, but I didn't need onion and garlic flavor and other mysterious enhancements. Just plain nuts were what I wanted."
1,Never received the item - Thanks Amazon,The order was shipped to an old address. Good luck finding a way to contact Amazon about something like this.
5,this was our country's music c.30 decades ago!,"I am fairly new to this series, but I now own 3 cds in this series: Anna Mag. Bach Book, Festive barouque christmas and now this one. I have been looking for a cd with this kind of music, and now my search is done. I enjoy this cd very much, but the only down side is that this cd is too short."
3,Less than perfect,"I rec'd the Phillimore Atlas & Index of Parish Registers 3rd Edition quickly, however, even though the shipper used sturdy cardboard packaging, the top right-hand corners of this hardbound book were dog-eared on receipt. The type and font are extremely small and difficult to read, even though I have perfect vision. Wish I had not spent this much money on this publication."
5,Great reference,"I couldn't begin to count the number of times we've used this book to find information on a particular aircraft. And, I can't remember ever being disappointed. The book is packed with information on American military aircraft. At a minimum, each entry includes at least one picture, sketches of several silhouette views, information on the aircraft's dimensions, weight, available armament configurations and the aircraft's history, including dates of service. I can't imagine a better reference book."
3,volumes 1 and 2,"From the back cover:Vol I:Acclaimed as one of the finest, most exciting documentary films ever made. More than two years in the making, it literally covers the entire world in which we live. From New Guinea to the United States, from France to Malaya and Arabia, this is a stark, realistic portrayal of humanity in practically all of its stages from the most primitive to complete sophistication. A truely magnificent musical score has been added, carefully developed and recorded so that on its own it is an important contribution to the arts. The song ""More"", which forms the basis for the score, was nominated for an Academy Award. This film portrays life around us, whether we have recognized it or not. Not for the squeamish.Vol II:A continuing look at the bizarre world of cults, cannibalism, animal sacrifices, ethnic rituals and strange practices found around the globe."
3,Leviticus,"Wearing a proud Genesis influence like a badge this lower level, obscure import manages to hold enough interest so as to not render the tribute trite, where so many more popular progressive acts have attempted and failed with shoddier supposed emulations."
2,very disappointed,"sites and songs of israel-video tapeexpected israeli singers - not a travelogue with music in the background. the travelogue was inconsistent and choppy, put together very amateurishly."
2,"Not what you think, or is it??","Being a former sailor (84-06), I was looking for a book about how this new DDG was going to be put together mabe a photo or something, but this is not the case. This book is more into looking at how this new class ship is budgeted, how/who will get contracts, timelines of when it will be built....someting that a person working in a shipyard supervisor might want to look at, oh well."
3,A Good First Effort...,"Being a big fan of Swartzwelder's work on the Simpsons, I was really looking forward to this.I read another online review saying this felt like a very rough draft of a very funny novel. That's sort of how I felt about it.About 2/3 of the way through it, it starts to pick up a lot, and gets pretty funny. But I felt, overall, that, while a good attempt at a first novel, it was nowhere near as funny as I thought it would be. I like this style of writing, but something about it just didn't ring true to me. Worth a read, but I'm not sure if it's worth $15..."
4,funny but overpriced,"Fairly short, absurd book. Not quite laugh-out-loud funny. Not worth $15. $7 maybe."
3,Huge fan,I loved when he was writing on SNL but guess I have to read it again since the writers and producers on the Simpsons ranted and raved about it. I cannot find anything funny about it shockingly. But willing to be patient and read it again.
3,"Okay, but not great","Perhaps I set my expectations a bit high for this book but it seemed to have a lot of good word of mouth. I enjoy irreverent humour, but just found this book meandered a lot, I think there were only a few parts that really made me laugh. Oh well, its hardly terrible, and it seems many people enjoyed it so perhaps it just wasnt my slice of lemon.For those that like absurd humour, I highly recommend 'Danny Yates Must Die' & 'Mr. Landon has no brain' both are by Stephen Walker and are excellently insane"
4,"Interesting read, style of writing like no other author","Swartzwelder has a style of writing which is a quick wit and keeps the reader on their toes.I was attracted to the book because of the Simpsons aspect. Some of the Simpson's DVD sets (I think year 6 or 7) had some of the former producers and writer talking about Swartzwelder's book, when they talk about specific espisodes.It was a quick read and entertaining. There are some funny passages, but the book can also loose its way with the story."
5,A detecive story for the everyman.,"You will laugh, or at least find this book amusing, if you don't laugh out loud normally, just remember it's not the simpsons, just a guy who wrote for them. and with good reason, It's short. but with your ""Busy"" lifestyle and the many volumes of harry potter you've yet to finish you could fit it in.Either way it's a nice read. if you can find it check it out."
2,Just Plain Bad.,"The main character of the book describes himself as not too bright, not very perceptive, and having a poor sense of what is going on. Unfortunately this person is actually telling us the story. Having a narrator who has no powers of description, limited intelligence, little grasp of punctuation, and no clue how to structure a story makes for a really bad book. I have been a Simpson's fan for years and had high hopes for the book, but, really, it's annoying trying to follow the senseless meanderings of a random idiot. None of the characters are developed at all, the plot is really weak, the writing is bad and sloppy. Worst of all the narrator doesn't understand what's going on. Anyone else see the huge problem there? The author should have. Disappointing."
1,"BEWARE, IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY!!!!! DON'T WASTE $16","Are these people who are writing these reviews you see boring sacks or am I missing something? This book is not ""laugh out loud funny"" or ""so funny I had to put the down"". This book just isn't funny. It's a mildly entertaining story, maybe for kid (the text is huge and it's only 150 or so pages).DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! Amazon has so much more great books to offer.Detective Burley is a crappy character and the stories about him really aren't worth a intelligent person's time."
3,Funny but not fantastic,"Being a big Simpsons fan I was expecting this book to have me rolling on the floor laughing, but I was disappointed. The jokes are great but the story is so mixed up and goofy (the confusion is often what provides the jokes) that it kinda distracts from the great one liners. Enjoyable and silly. A really quick and funny read."
2,"It's kinda funny, but pointless to the point of upsetting","I'm a HUGE fan of the Simpsons. But forty pages into this book I realized this kind of humor is A LOT funnier as a cartoon. I just found it frustrating how senseless and absurd the whole story is. It's like having to read a Leslie Neilson spoof. I just got tired of characters with two brain cells. There's no straight man to anchor the insanity. Every character is as brain dead as the main character Burley. It's too much like having to read a Looney Toons cartoon. I recommend you pick up Chris Genoa's ""FOOP"" instead. It's just as funny as this book, but much smarter."
4,Shwartz delivers,"Half Simpsons episode with different characters, half Vonnegut's Timequake. If you read the first page online and enjoy it you will enjoy the entire story. Definately offbeat and completely enjoyable. It won't change your life but was entirely more than a good read. Leave your reasoning behind and enjoy the trip."
2,Spoiler alert: at the end of this book you will be disappointed.,I had high hopes for a prolific Simpsons writer. I was disappointed. I guess cartoon humor doesn't translate well into sci-fi detective stories. Save your money and time. I am curious how the author feels about this work.
3,"Great Help, But Only The Last 100 Pages","After having been given the task of researching the plausibility of the Mongol invasions of Japan, I checked out this book from the local library. The first one-third of the book is a translation of the manuscripts of a samurai after the invasions seeking rewards for his service. This was not very useful to my research but possibly the only English translation of this important work that is easily accessible. The next one-third is a translation of other works pertaining to the Mongol invasions. These works were not necessary for any mainstream analysis of these events. The final one-third consisted of the author's personal research on the counter of the popular Japanese sentiment of divine intervention. I found this to be helpful and insightful, yet too short. If more of the book had been devoted to the author's interpretations and conclusions, the book would have been a better read. From a purely reference point of view, this book is quite useful."
5,Everyone Rally for The 2nd and 3rd Seasons,We all have to put the pressure on Buena Vista Home Entertainment to get them to release the remaining seasons on dvd. ...
5,How can you not love it ?,I love the show and was so upset when it was cancelled..My daughter and I have watched the show from the 1st episode to the last..I have been a hugh fan of Sela Ward's since her days as Teddy Reed on Sisters..the chemistry between Sela Ward and Billy Campbell is very exciting... all the characters are great and they seem to work so well together..
5,Relates to all age groups,"Having been a fan of Sela Ward from the programs 'Sisters' and Marshall Herskovitz of Thirtysomething I was pretty confident that I would love Once and Again. I was right. Having been divorced only a few years ago at the age of 26 and no children, I felt I may be a little young to be able to relate to the trials and tribulations that face the main characters daily. However I soon realized that the anxieties, joys and fears I experienced are the same reality for anyone who goes through this difficult transition in life. This show reflected the truths and not the romanticized view of rebuilding ones life that hollywood tends to spoonfeed us. I recommend this to anyone male or female, married or divorced, aged 25-60, it is a journey worth taking and I look forward to the remaining seasons being released."
5,P L E A S E !,"Once and again is the best TV show ever and the release of this DVD has made me soooo happy!Please, DO release season 2 and 3 as well!!"
2,"Disappointed, Frankly","I went into this show expecting to love it. I enjoyed Sela Ward on ""Sisters"" ... I'm a huge fan of Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick's previous work (including ""Family,"" ""thirtysomething"" and ""My So-Called Life"") ... plus I'm a total sucker for a well-written romance. So it pains me to report how much I ended up NOT liking ""Once & Again."" I'm not even really sure how to explain it, except to say that there was never a single moment, the whole time I was watching it, when I wasn't acutely aware that I was watching actors acting. The whole thing seemed very artificial and contrived. The adolescent characters didn't ring true for me, either, nor did the character of Lily's sister ... and since these characters are integral to the plot development, that left a huge believability deficit for me. I actually ended up returning the DVD set for a refund. Hopefully it will be purchased by someone who enjoys the show as much as the rest of you seem to."
5,Once And Again,"Oh my gosh, why in the world did they shut this show down, this was one of my most favorite television show that i really looked forward too every week, not only exceptional actors and actresses, but this relates to everyone that goes through life, they always take off the good ones, I was happy to see the reruns on Lifetime on Fridays, I brought the DVD collection, so please tell me if you know if they are going to release the 2nd and 3rd season, please I surely hope so, there will never be another show this good! Thank You"
5,Once & Again 3 Seasons Box set,"We can only hope and wait for a box set DVD release of the single BEST program ever to grace the air waves. To bad it was wasted on a terrible network. Let's all demand this be released as a DVD box set. The series is a must see. ""It's just such a beautiful story."""
3,plastic watch but fine for the price,"There's nothing wrong with this watch and the price is very reasonable. Its very plastic looking though and the metal rim actually isn't metal, its plastic.It looks like a 20buck watch and that's what it cost."
3,Just doesn't taste very good.,"I wanted this to be even moderately tasty so that my 3-yr-old would eat it. He's picky, and Kraft Mac and Cheese is something I can always get him to eat - but hate that it's so highly processed and non-organic. Quite frankly, Amy's just doesn't taste very good. It's bitter, the cheese is thin (and I got rid of the water in the shells).I still give it three stars because of Amy's business practices which I love - but won't buy again."
3,could be better,"When you mix the cheese sauce with milk, the mixture becomes too thin. So I mix a small amount of cheese into the shells along with the other sauce, and this makes it more thick."
2,Not near as good as Annie's creamy delux mac & cheese,This the only product of Annie's that I am disappointed in. The cheese powder is not nearly as flavorful as Annie's creamy delux mac and cheese with the foil packet of cheese sauce (which my family and I all love and will be the only kind I buy from now on).
2,Tastes Like the No-Name Store Brand,"It tastes absolutely the same as any other store mac-and-cheese. The ""totally natural"" cheese is a fine-as-talcum-powder substance in a foil packet. Save some money and buy the store brand for 69 cents on sale at Ralph's Market."
3,Kraft is better,"This mac n' cheese is pretty tasty, but honestly I think the cheap boxes of Kraft are more delicious and they don't cost as much. The shells are smaller than I'd like and the cheese doesn't really blend that well, so I always get tiny chunks of cheese powder in my meals. Nobody wants that."
4,Better Than Watery Old Commerical Kraft...,"The trick to Annie's is to use only butter and no milk (or just a splash). Using all of the milk that the directions call for will give you cheese of a watery consistency. This is also a really good deal on this stuff, considering that it is about $2 per box in the grocery store."
1,Wanted to love this but...,"I normally love everything made by Annie's and often buy the bunny grahams and fruit snacks for my grandson. However, I was stunned by how much I hated this mac and cheese mix!! It's absolutely awful --the cheese sauce tastes artificial and leaves a weird aftertaste. Sorry Annie, but won't purchase this again. I will give it one star for being organic."
1,not worth the price,I found this product to be tasteless. Even a dollar store product has more flavor than this does. Iwould never buy this brand again and would not recomend it to anyone.
1,These are completely vile,"I bought these after reading all the great reviews and I would not advise you to do the same -- not to the tune of 12 boxes anyway. I've foisted as much off on friends as I can and I still have one box left.It's funny that everyone raves about it being free of chemicals, etc. because to me the taste makes me think of exactly that. It's just truly awful -- does not resemble a cheese taste in the slightest. Just a weird sharp and very unpleasant taste. The sauce is thin. They are even worse is you try to reheat. Obviously, this is just my opinion, but I warn you not to buy 12 boxes if you're a first-timer!"
5,Great Mac & Cheese,I love this product. Great taste and I like being able pronounce (and know)all of the ingredients.
3,Good Alternative-Don't Care for the Organic Mumbo Jumbo,"Annie's Natural Shells are a good alternative to the pasty white flour Kraft Mac & Cheese. Flavor is good for boxed Mac & Cheese when you just want something quick and easy.What I really don't care for is all of their organic and the ""I'm saving the Earth so I'm a better person for buying this product"" mumbo jumbo. There are those of us that just want healthy alternatives without all of the being green political correctness.The fact is that the dairy products that Annie's uses come from cows that eventually end up in a saluter house. ""How nice is that Mr. Rabbit?"""
5,Good for What It Is,"I compare this to Kraft or other conventional mac 'n cheese products and give it a 5. You cannot compare it to homemade, however. I actually haven't touched any mac n cheese other than natural ones in decades...yuk. But this is a product I like to have on hand for nights I don't want to cook. Quick, easy--almost like not cooking. Tasty."
2,"Truly Awful, Smelled of Vomit","My husband and I bought an ""Annies"" mac and cheese one night at our local store. It was amazing, and we were so excited that we decided to buy a large lot online. I couldn't find the exact style we bought, but the lable on this box was almost identical to the other Annies. I was WRONG, this was awful - the cheese was a powder instead of the pre-mixed packet that came in our original box. It was watery and smelled like vomit. It left a bad after-taste. I do not recommend this particular type of Annies."
1,disgusting.,I honestly would rather gnaw on the box this macaroni came in than to ever eat a bite of the actual product again. I am all for organic foods but this is just plain disgusting.
2,weird taste,"I bought some because I love mac and cheese, and lived off the kraft ones in college. However, I became concerned about the laundry list of chemicals kraft uses,including Yellow # 5. This box uses annatto and beta carotene for coloring.Its difficult to put in words what this taste like. On one hand its utterly bland and flavorless, yet it also leaves a weird sharp chemical like aftertaste in your mouth. I've tried the white cheddar one as well and it had a similar taste. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because I like the fact that it does not use yellow #5 for coloring, but I don't think I'll be giving Annie's pasta another chance."
2,Not as good as it used to be...,"My children and I have eaten Annie's macaroni & cheese for over ten years and loved it. So it was to my dismay when I began to notice in the last year that the flavor was obviously reformulated to be much weaker. The directions were also reconfigured. It used to be 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of milk; now it calls for 1/4 cup of milk, which is why the outcome is so runny and yucky. My children have never eaten Kraft mac & cheese, so we were comparing the difference in taste with the original Annies. I honestly expect that my family will wean themselves of Annies mac & cheese because the flavor is that disappointing and bland."
4,Yummy mac and Cheese,Overall i loved this mac and cheese. Only thing i did not like is it did not reheat very well. It was not as cheesy tasting when reheated.
1,no flavor,"Was very disappointed, there was no real cheese flavor. Had to add our own extra sharp cheddar to give it pop. Also, cheese sauce didn't cover the noodles well."
2,Disapointing after all these great reviews!,"I really wanted to like these, but unfortunately, can't stand the taste of the cheese sauce. (I don't care for Kraft either).The ingredients are better in Annies Homegrown Mac & Cheese, so if I could stand the taste, I'd eat it without question. But the taste is, is my opinion, acidic and just bad. Almost like another reviewer said : vomit-like.Now what will I do with the case that is left?"
2,Taste like vomit,"Tastes like sick chemicals. I cannot imagine any child eating this and liking it, same goes with all of Annie's mac and cheese products. Sauce is thin, noodles are too small, and it tastes like vomit or stomach acid (I'm serious). Kraft now makes Organic mac and cheese and it's DELICIOUS, I'm eating some right now."
2,"Hey now, wait a minute...","Yes, overall this collection is not very good. But I do think the first two tracks are at least interesting covers.But my big disagreement with the other reviewer here is regarding Moby's cover of New Dawn Fades.I think it's great. Yes, it's different from the original, but it definitely captures the anguish and frustration. It is just as strong and overwhelming as the Joy Division version. I would have assumed that all JD fans liked the Moby track."
4,"When, Why ... If","This book has a lot of wisdom, it has put into words and made me think about what I already knew and just didn't understand"
3,Not what I hoped it would be,"I'm not a Wiccan and I mention that because it's an important caveat to this review. This book was written for Wiccans and primarily deals with ethics from that perspective. I'll admit that I didn't really care for this book. At times I found the author to be condescending. She came off as a stern mother lecturing her way-ward son about how to behave. I also didn't see a lot of commentary on magic and ethics which I hoped for. I suspect the lack of it has more to do with the fact that its a book on Wiccan ethics, wherein Wicca tends to treat magic as a secondary activity. If you're Wiccan, this could be a useful book for providing some guidance on expected behaviors. If you're a practitioner of other Pagan religions or more focused on magical practice, this book will probably not be that helpful."
5,A MUST READ for every small business owner!!!!,"If you own a small business or are thinking about starting a small business, you MUST to read this book. It will pay for itself a thousand times. It takes a very technical and cumbersome topic and transforms it into a very well written and easy to read book. Unfortunately, taxes are a huge part of owning your own business. I have a retired IRS auditor, a CPA, and a Master of Tax working for me. But ultimately, the taxes are my responsibility. And I'm the one who's on the hook with the IRS if anything is wrong. This book gave me a very solid foundation to understanding small business tax, and allows me to have much more educated conversations with my tax advisors. I would strongly recommend this book as a starting point for anyone trying to understand small business taxes."
5,"Oops, I almost did it wrong. Actually, many things.","I operate custom photographic services (editorial/advertising photography, with headshot and a few other things on the side) and when I started, I went to a couple of tax seminars and business seminars, where I learned a lot of useful tips on record keeping, tax and business finance. I actually learned enough things there so that more senior business owners ask me questions at business networking events. HOWEVER, this book is something I wish I had when I went to those seminars. You know, those accountants putting together nice presentations and example handouts are of course openly evasive of tricky situations that happen to people like me. This book provides enough details and examples so that I can decide what to do with confidence. Those old guys at the network events now leave me alone because they know I just tell them to get this book, so that I have more time networking with people of my age."
4,Helpful info,"If your small business does its own taxes via software, instead of an accountant, then this book can provide good supplemental information. This book can also help you decide what to keep as personal expenses versus small business expenses, in order to minimize taxes."
4,Mostly business,"Well put together, through & easy to understand. Pertains mostly to business deductions, but does cover some basic personal taxes."
5,Great Book for Non-Accounting Types Who Need to Understand Deductions,"As I small business owner, I have to admit that I was not clear on all of the deductions that were available. More importantly, I was reluctant to deduct anything I was not clear on.This is a very clearly written book, without the usual legal-ease. There is just the right amount of information without going into too much detail. Having said that, it is still a large book at over 500 pages.The Ten Tips for avoiding an audit was worth the price of the book. For example:Tip #4: Don't File Electronically. Surprised? I was. It seems the IRS only transcribes about 40% of the information from paper filings. With electronic filings, 100% of the data is available.This is an easy to read book with a wealth of information that every small business should have. I certainly feel more comfortable with my deductions now."
2,suspicious how many Vine reviews pumping up this book's rating,"This book sounds good, but the large number of reviews are padded with way too many Vine program reviews. About 32 (if I counted right) 5-star reviews are Vine people. 32! More than half. Makes me suspicious. So I'm buying a different book not Vine-hyped and I'll review it after I read it."
4,Great reference for any small business,"This book offers a lot of information on how to take advantage of the tax deductions that are afforded to the small business owner. This information will allow you to speak intelligently to your tax preparer, to make sure that you get the maximum deductions allowed by law. Sometimes a little complicated in explanation, but such is the convoluted doctrine of the IRS tax codes. After reading this book I am thoroughly convinced that our tax system is in desperate need of a complete overhaul.""IF YOU OWN A SMALL BUSINESS YOU NEED THIS BOOK!!! """
3,Deduct It! Lower your Business Taxes,Somewhat Informative. I still went to a tax Advisor and some things in the book didn't agree with His advice.
5,Highly readable and informative,"This book is a must small business owners because it can improve their bottom line. Although it provides fairly good overview of tax deudctions, it should not be used as a comprehensive reference for tax professionals.The book is a relatively light read in a highly readable format. Each tax deduction has a good overview and a case example to boot. It isn't, however, an answer to complex tax questions which the book willingly acknowledges should be taken to a tax professional. For most business owners, this book should be sufficient for most of the tax deduction questions they may have. This book certainly answered all of mine.The book provides valuable information on the probability of an IRS audit (don't form sole proprietorship if you want to avoid an audit) and how one can minimize one's chances of an audit."
4,"So simple to understand, excellent examples","I read this book after forming a C-Corp in California (using the Nolo guide). Although I am familiar with many biz deductions, this book walks you through many examples of deductions you can take if you plan ahead. I really like the ""Day in the Life of..."" examples of how you can maximize legal deductions pertaining to mileage. There's an excellent section on home office deductions. My husband, a self-admitted dummy when it comes to expense reports, taxes, etc., picked up the book after I was done, and even he understands the concepts. Already he has found deductions for his sole proprietorship and non-reimbursed employee biz expenses. Great value and so easy to understand. Highly recommend."
3,Best Archos to date... Same problems,"This is Archos' best player to date. The size (physical) is spot on and the layout of the controls are perfect. These last few weeks have been a blast loading videos from my Tivo and DVD's onto the device. I've even connected the A/V out to the LCD display in the van. Kids love it! Everything stated in the below reviews is accurate and I won't restate them here.Now the bad news. I'm an old time Archos buyer. I've had the Jukebox series players and now the GIMINI 400. The Jukebox players suffered from cheap electrical contacts and so does the GMINI. They fail under normal use. My player's down button failed in the third week and I am taking it back. I don't plan on getting another unit.Archos needs to step up the internal qualitity on their builds. I anticipate that more people will also be getting their buttons repaired since this player can also function as a game device. If your buttons haven't failed yet, consider yourself lucky."
5,Better than the IPOD,"The Archos Gmini 400 is great. I enjoy digital photography,and the CF card slot is great for digital photographers. It does everything the IPOD does and MORE. I mainly use it for music and photography. I recently used it on a camping trip, perfect for storing CF cards when there is no computer around. It transfered a 512mb in about 3-4 min... maybe faster. Then I hooked it up to a TV with the INCLUDED cables and was able to show a slideshow to my family.It is surprisingly small. The only downside is that it is not popular in the mainstream, so there are not as many custom accessories for it, especially compared to the IPOD.It is the perfect MP3 player for a digital photographer."
3,Archos Gmini 400 experience,"I like my archos 400.Actually, I think Archos makes a better portable video player than Apple.I've purchased both Ipod 30gig video and Archos Gmini 400.I think my Archos hardware performed better, but here comes the negative:Archos software is terribleArchos technical support is terribleWell with that said you understand why I purchased the Ipod.Someday Archos will correct these problems, in the mean time buya ipod."
1,garbage,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT TO BUY AN IPOD.This item is garbage.Its slow and more difficult to use.It ended up breaking one week after warranty was up and the customer service is HORRIBLE.I asked them how could I retrieve the data in the unit and they were clueless.They then asked me to send it in so they could give me a a quote to fix my item, however they told me they would reformat it and i would loose all my data ( which was not an option)The tech support people sound like they have no idea what they are talking about and sound less elequant than a 16 yr old drive through windom attendant at white castle."
1,YUCK!,"I usually love Boy George, but I bought this cd, played it once and thought it was horrible. But since I usually love Boy George, I gave it a few more tries, and it still stunk, so I gave it away to a friend who usually loves Boy George too. My friend also hated it, and being a kinder person then I am, he didn't want to inflict it on someone else who usually loves Boy George, so he threw it out. That's how bad this is. If you usually love Boy George, this one may change your mind."
3,more Skye,"I have a love/hate relationship with the Skye series. Wheeler is always at his best when describing the lives/customs of the various native tribes, but large plot holes often arise from Skye's ambiguous motivations. In this book (and perhaps this is a slight spoiler), Skye walks right up to an authority of a British company, he knows this man is an authority who may still be seeking Skye for previously deserting the Navy, and Skye introduces himself as Skye. Why in the world wouldn't Skye give himself a new name? Why does he tell people he doesn't trust his history of deserting the Navy? We saw this previously in book #4 of the series, where Skye gets handcuffed and nearly hauled back to England. Obvioiusly this is all done to create drama for the story. But it's phony, and doesn't ring true."
2,poorly made,I use the vacuum in my home about once a week- only two people live here1. cord frayed in the first month and continues to fray in different areas.2. the hose pops out at least once a vacuum session.3. the hose clogs and has to be removed and cleaned constantly.I can remember when a Hoover was a great product; not now
3,Disappointed in Connecticut,"Who is Mr. Tully? An authority on herbs or an entertainment company owner? The viewer is not given information that establishes the credibility of the person delivering the info on native american herbs. The content of the video should be more appropriately titled ""herbs of the southwest"" since that is the focus. On the positive side, the video offers some basic information about a limited number of herbs. The low-budget format of this video, however, doesn't justify the high purchase price."
4,"Great for home use, but consider ink costs as well","This is an excellent printer for those who don't print a lot. It will print documents at a very reasonable speed, and wonderful photos on 4x6 tabbed paper. The hardware has proven to be pretty reliable, as this new printer is based on HP's older Deskjet 3500 series.The software has been improved greatly over last year's products. There is now a much lower chance of problems with installation. The extra software that's included isn't too large, so this printer is good for PC's close to the minimum requirements.If you print more than 100 pages a month, or if you have a business, I'd recommend the Deskjet 6540 instead, as the ink costs half as much. Due to the higher ink cost, the 3745 is a good choice only if you don't print a lot. Otherwise, it is an excellent printer for home use."
3,Prints well but noisy,A nice inexpensive printer that prints documents well. Have not tried photos as I do not have that need. The only drawback is that the paper feed system/motor is very noisy compared to other HP printers that I have had.
2,Poor paper feed,"i am disappointed in this printer for the way it handles feeding the paper. It jams, or puts through many blank pages, or refuses to work at all if the paper tray has too much (seemingly a normal amount) of paper in it.My husband worked as a printer technician for Hewlett Packard, but even he can't get it to improve its performance. Every time I try to use it, I have to call him to get it to work at all, and even then the pages are not printed well (half a page on one sheet of paper, the other part on a different sheet, for example.)When I was asked by email to rate this printer, I hadn't yet used it so was not able to express these faults. I haven't saved the packing materials with which to return it. I can't afford to buy a better one."
4,"Good, inexpensive printer","I bought this printer in replacement of another HP Deskjet printer (I wore it out after 4 years). It is super quiet and fast! It was easy to install as well. Like most printers, it did not come with a USB cable - but it is easy to find a cable for it (2.0 or 1.1 USB Cable will work). I bought my printer at Wal-mart and it came with two cartiages (color & black). It actually cost less without the shipping/handling at Wal-mart.The print quality appears to be very good. I recommend this printer for those looking for an inexpensive printer."
1,To Big for a portable printer,"I purchased this printer for my laptop and to have on the go capability of being able to print out in the field or at job sites. The reviews stated that it was a great printer for a laptop computer. I never opended the box, when I saw its sizeI did not hesitate to return it, which was actually a very easyprocess. Amazon came through as usual, after pricing around and reading some more reviews, and checking out local retailers I ended up with the Canon Pixma Ip90 which really met my needs. It is in the $200.00 range but well worth the money and exceededall my expectations for a mobile printer"
2,No USB cable,"I havent even tried this printer yet so maybe its unfair to critique it but i was extremely annoyed to find that it is missing an importnat cable. I looked all over for it and finally found in small letter on the box ""USB cable not provided"". So now i have to buy the cable and i think that is just downright unfair."
4,it was good,"Claudia does excellent on a math test but a teacher thinks she cheated, and it was really upsetting to hear that a teacher would condemn her for something she didn't do just because her marks were lower before."
2,Claudia's Not a Cheat,After having studied really hard for a math test Claudia is thrilled to have gotten an A. However she is accused of cheating. Her friends are behing her and set out to prove that she did not cheat. After all she studied hard and deserved the grade she got. I wasn't very impressed with this book. Most teachers would actually take the time to listen to both sides of the story to find out who cheated instead of jumping to conclusions. A teacher would probably also have them both resit the test immediately. This book is not nearly as good as some of the others.
3,Just Okay,"I was a bit disappointed with Smitten, Janet Evanovich's latest re-release. There are, as with so many of the early novels, signs of Pre-Plum - Aunt Elsie, the dog Fergason... However, even though Lizabeth has aspirations of being a Fairy Princess, that's where her Plum-ness stops. She's a bit dim-witted & silly and sudden boyfriend Matt's male chauvinist tendencies are a bit much. Evanovich has become a much better writer over time since these earlier novels were created. C.J. Critt does her usual great job on the audio version."
4,good condition,this book came in a timely fashion. the condition was as described. i am very happy with this purchase.
3,"Quick , easy read....,","This was a sweet, brief story. Very predictable and very little brain power needed to get through it. I tend to prefer stories with a lot of depth, but this was a nice way to pass the time while I was recuperating from the flu."
1,"One-dimensional, annoying characters","""Because I'm a Mooooooooom!""... You know, even though I'm not a child lover, I can usually tolerate them in books and movies. But this one, with the attitude of Lizabeth throughout the book and the ramming down your throat of the responsibilities of motherhood, was so annoying I almost didn't finish it. If it hadn't been so short and so quick to read, I probably wouldn't have. I certainly couldn't identify with Lizabeth, and didn't even like her. The plot was sad, even for a romance novel. There was nothing interesting about the book at all.I love Stephanie Plum with all my heart, but that's really the only thing Evanovich has done well."
2,I'm embarrassed to admit......,"that I even read this book! Even knowing it's a re-release doesn't help!My sister-in-law and I are avid Plum fans and I guess it will have to suffice to say that we will simply stick to the Plum titles and leave the rest behind.This book was SO light, I'm surprised it didn't just float away. I think successful writers should not be so money-hungry that reprinting of old titles becomes the name of the game... JMHO"
5,Funny and entertaining,Who doesn't love Janet Evanovich? A quick read that made me laugh out loud. Keep on writing Janet! I will buy every book.
4,Developing Evanovich,This is an early effort with strong hints of what's to come in later novels. A fun read that fills the time waiting for new material.
3,Smitten,"Janet Evanovich comes through again. ""Smitten"" had me laughing out loud at several points in the book. It is definitely brain candy, and can be read in a few hours, but they will be very enjoyable hours. I recommend it to anyone that likes to laugh!"
2,Re-release,Janet Evanovich has become a much better writer since writing this book....I prefer her Stefanie Plum series and hope she doesn't give up on them..
3,Good balanced light read.,"This book was, a tad unbelievable at times (I mean its hard enough to convince a contractor to hire a qualified woman... let alone a delicate on with no experience), but entertaining noneless the less. Between the dog eating everything and the streaker streaker scenes it was even pretty funny. Not one of my favoritce by Evanovich, but I didnt have trouble getting through it!"
2,Decent.,"In the beginning, I was a dedicated ""Stephanie Plum"" fan but from the last past few books, I was very disgusted in the reused plots. But I have always had faith in Janet Evanovich and writing, so I gave her another chance and I checked out the audiobook of this story from my library. If you looking for a book with in-depth character development and a good plot, this isn't the book for you. But if you looking for a light fluffy read, this is definitely the book for you.I give this book two stars because of the characters! Now that I know this is a re-release, I can definitely see that the characters in this story are definitely the inspiration of the characters of her other stories and it kind of annoys me. She reuses the characters and the plots. So she let me down with this book and this is probably be the last book I will read from her."
3,Ho hum,These three stories left me wanting more information. Not impressed with this book. I am dissappointed with the author on this one.
1,"Three Strikes, It's Bad",One of the most disappointing books Debbie Macomber has written. What happened to her great writing. I would not recommend taking time to read this book.
4,"Three Brides, No Groom",This I thought was a very nice read. It kind of made you think is it going where I think it is or is it not
1,"3 Brides, No Groom",This book like all of her others really kept me wanting to read more. Just loved the ending and would not have guessed the it beforehand.Cannot wait to read her newest book.
5,"Three Brides, No Groom",This was recommended by a friend. I have read a lot by Debbie Macomber and she is a great author.
3,"Three Brides, No Grom","The ending was unusual for her. It was not a normal bookfor her. There were parts that jumped around, but overall it was a good book."
3,good book,Good but predictable. Read within a day. Liked it but figured out the ending before the second section was half way through
3,A mediocre Macomber,"This one just doesn't do it. All three stories are excellent in themselves. However, the set-up of the books ruins each plot. The reader must wait until then end of the book to find out what happens to each character, and it is more frustrating than suspenseful. I recommend having someone who read this book tell you which page to jump to after you read each short story."
3,"Quick and Cute, but little substance!","Three women meet for their class reunion. Though not friends during their college years, they get together to discuss what happened in the first weeks and months after college graduation. In doing so they reveal how their lives have turned out to be nothing what their class mates had expected. EAch woman tells her story, none of them quite turning out as expected. But the epilouge explains it all and pulls it all together. Though they were cute stories, there was very little substance to require the amount of pages it took to write the book. Some of the fluff could have been taken out and reduced the book in half."
3,Not so Hot,"While I usually love anything written by Macomber, I must say this book needed much more revision before it was published. The three women who share their stories of what happened after college are believable, and the plot lines are also good, but the events bridging them all together, some of the situations and much of the dialogue TELLS rather than SHOWS. Debbie can do better than this"
3,too rushed in parts,"i was over all pleased with the book ,gretchen was way too long and carol was shorter but by the time we got to maggie it was like whoosh...i felt that instead these women would have been better if maybe they were written in a mini series type thing instead of one book because you really wish for more development of all characters and left with the feeling of a great ending but kinda quick...."
4,Good read,This was another of Debbie Macomber good reads. Pretty predictable but still a good story. I enjoy most of her books.
1,Worst film ever.,"This film was obviously rated high so that the sellers could sell it for an exhorbitant price. I was embarassed to show it to my students. We laughed our way through it. I should rate it highly so as to resell it, but I wouldn't do that to my worst enemy if I had one."
5,L&O seasons,"I enjoyed this very much, I finally got to see the complete first seaston. I had a good time watching some of the episodes that I had not seen."
2,Not as good as SVU.,"Law and Order was a decent series until it fell apart with ridiculous twists and turns and a cast that grew less and less enthusiastic as the seasons went on. I don't know about you, but I prefer SVU over this, which may have had just as many ludicrous twists, but was more gripping and plausible."
2,Skip the First Four Seasons--Best Cast Yet to Come,"I love Law & Order. I watch it on TNT. I used to watch it on A&E. And, of course, I watch it on NBC in prime time. But if I see it's from Seasons 1-4, I don't watch. I can't stand the cast in the early seasons. Michael Moriarty pales in comparison to the amazing Sam Waterston; neither George Dzunda nor Paul Sorvino can hold a candle to Jerry Orbach; and, of course, it's good to see some women (S. Epatha Merkerson, Jill Hennesey, Carey Lowell, Angie Harmon, Elisabeth Rohm) in the cast. Yes, Steven Hill is a better D.A. than Dianne Weist, but he's around for a few of these years, and this year former Senator Fred Dalton Thompson has taken over as Jack McCoy's boss. The other male policemen (Benjamin Bratt, followed by Jesse L. Martin) are worthy successors to Chris Noth. I strongly urge waiting for the fifth season with the far better casts."
5,great series,"This is the season that got me hooked, they dont show these eps until the WAY early mornings, glad i found this"
5,1 episode,this is a great episode and it its clear and it features all the older original characters. It was also easy to download and watch.
5,"The best show on television, is now on DVD","This collector's set is one of the best things to come out on DVD. It would be a great gift to a friend or loved one, or even to yourself. Any fan of Law+Order should love this set (if they are a true fan, of course). I have been watching the show for about eight years, and I still look forward to every Wednesday night at 10PM EST.Why watch the commercial-ridden reruns on TNT or A+E when you can watch the best show on television commercial-free and digitally remastered?Get this set and catch up on those episodes that you haven't seen or would love to see again. Or buy the set for a friend who loves the show or you are trying to get into watching the show. My wife hated the show eight years ago, but now looks forward to every episode (new or old) just as much as I do. The shows is addicting, and I love it.NOTE: If you love this show, you should also check out the Law+Order video game."
5,I can't believe it took this long!,"As a Law & Order fan since the first show, I've been waiting for the set of season be realesed in a box set. I love'd reminiscing the original seasons shows. Law & Order has been on television for 13 years now and has spawned 2 other related serries (Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Law & Order: SVU). If you a fan you need this set, I'm awaiting the release of season 2 coming in Spring of 2003."
5,Television DVD,This DVD was a perfect gift. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The price was good. I would definitely make further purchases from this seller in the future.
4,Loved Season One- Season Two Coming!,"The shakedown season of Law & Order was gritty and great. Now the 2nd Year DVD release has been announced by Universal Home Video.May 4, 2004 is the street date for this box set, which follows in the footsteps of The First Year with similar packaging design and specs, with one exception: Universal is moving this to double-sided DVDs in order to cut the disc count in half and save you (and themselves, of course) some money, plus take up less space on the shelf in the bargain.Video is, of course, full screen mode with audio in English 2.0 Dolby and French 2.0 Dolby, with subtitles in French and Spanish. This release is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.$59.98 is the list price for Law & Order - The 2nd Year"
5,Four Witnesses,"If you ever wondered about the early years of the Christian church, this book is a wonderful source of information about four heroes of the Way who held fast to the teachings of the original disciples, and the battle they fought to help the fledgling church remain faithful to those teachings.Interesting, very readable and extremely inspiring."
1,Catholic Propaganda,"This book is typical Catholic propaganda. This man was duped into exalting the word of man over the word of God, pretending the word of man is superior to the witnesses of the Christians in the Bible.Satan won yet another another soul."
5,liked them,These chips are very good. Keep in mind they are a little thicker than a regular chip. But I think the taste is great.
4,"Beautiful, but...?","I am a recent subscriber to the magazine, so I was drawn to the book by it's truly AMAZING photos. The garden definitions at the beginning of each section were a nice addition, too. I do wish, however, it had just a BIT more content. It is inspiring to leaf through, and dream!"
3,Very beautiful book.,This book is very beautifully put together. The pictures are bright and clear. The writings are interesting. Very helpful to to give you ideas for your own garden.
2,Half Decent !,"6 half decent but very short(15 minutes a piece) low-budget J-horror ghost stories. There is nothing here to rave about & there are plenty of better japanese horror films to choose from. So unless you find this in a 3$ bin somewhere i'd recommend passing on this one,but if you have to own everything to do with japanese horror then go nutts!"
3,ok but not really worth the money.,I bought this because i collect japanese horror films. I enjoyed it but the acting seemed really fake especially in the first story. I am glad to have it in my collection but they really could've done better.
2,Extremely disappointing,"There was a time when I would purchase any new David Bowie album without hearing a single track from it beforehand. This is the album that broke me of that habit. :-( Having been a fan (at this particular point in time) for 25 years, that's rather sad. ""Outside"" was one of the most disappointing albums I've ever heard. Bowie's venture into industrial metal should never have taken place. Despite the fact that 9-Inch Nails would have no career without the influence of David Bowie, the reciprocal situation does not work so well. I really only liked one track, a revamped ""Strangers When We Meet"" (originally recorded for ""The Buddha of Suburbia"" soundtrack). Even the most die-hard of Bowie fans (such as myself) might find this album not up to David's usual par."
5,ITS COMING.......,1. segue - A Brief Inquisition (0:45)2. Contamination (5:13)3. Ebola Jazz (4:28)4. A Fragmented Line (2:06)5. The Hive Of No Desire (5:33)6. segue - The Mad Ramblings of Long Beard (1:15)7. Ill Refute (5:06)8. A Tribe From The Ghost Plains (4:33)9. Drawing A Blank (3:48)10. Mausoleum (4:25)11.

2,Big dissapointment.,"Why did he release it? I know some people who say ""it's great"", but I prefer his songs with a bit of a tune instead of just creating a racket. I don't want to sound like an idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about, but listen to his other albums. They are so much better than this! The best thing Bowie did for this album was to give 'Hallo Spaceboy' to the Pet Shop Boys, have them remix it, and give himself a Top 20 hit.The little segments of dialogue he has created are useless. They don't seem to get anywhere. Besides 'Hallo Spaceboy', the only other decent track is 'Stranger When We Meet'.If you are wondering whether or not to buy it.... don't waste your money! I chose this over 'Black Tie White Noise' and I've regretted it ever since!"
5,Brilliant concept album!,"Let me put it this way: I've never been much of a follower (though I respect him a good deal) of Bowie's work. But when I first listened to this album I was hooked on it. At the time I was very much into Nine Inch Nails and music such as the soundtrack to David Lynch's ""Lost Highway,"" where ""I'm Deranged"" (one of this album's best songs) is featured. If you remotely like any of these, or if you enjoyed the movie ""Seven"" (I'm trying to provide you with some leads here) you will definitely love this album: it's very dark and full of mystery, so don't expect any light-hearted material here, except ""maybe"" for the song ""Strangers when we meet."" Brillant. A true masterpiece! True, as some another reviewer comments: this has been probably one of those unnoticed, ""underrated and underappreciated works of art."""
2,For Diehards Only,"As a huge Bowie fan for years, I was a bit disappointed with this one. It has some high points, most notably, ""Heart's Filthy Lesson"" and Mike Garson's piano work, but the rest is largely uninspiring.A futuristic romp that is a bit too Eurotech to sink one's teeth into. I do like the lyric content; definitely proving that Bowie is still the maniacal master. His prolific, chaotic lyrics/dialog are, at the same time innocent, and diabolical.Overall, the musical accompaniment seemed rather contrived to me. I love the rich textures and harmonic dissonance of past Bowie/Eno collaborations, but I wish the stream of consciousness on this effort broke into coherent song more often."
4,Fascinating Stuff,"The occasionally silly narrative is the only drawback to this record; I sometimes wonder what it would have sounded like without the various characters and their monologues interrupting these excellent songs. Not that the idea doesn't work: the dark, futuristic story informs the lyrics and gives the work a very creepy and urgent feel. Bowie, Eno, Gabrels and the rest of the personnel are said to have played role-playing games and engaged in various other musical experiments during the making of the record, and this sense of play and experimentation shows. Standout tracks: We Prick You, Hallo Spaceboy (which sounds brilliant nine years later on the current Reality tour), I'm Deranged, Strangers When We Meet, and I Have Not Been To Oxford Town.At least three of the songs from ""Outside"" were used in films; you have probably heard something from this record before, even if you don't know the work already."
4,One of those great albums...,"I dont know what it is.It seems like there are these grossly underrated, underappreciated works of art out there that go completely unnoticed and are shuffled to the back of the deck. ""Outside,"" a concept album by David Bowie, is indubitably one of those masterpieces. A journalistic, self-penetrating work with serious implications in relation to existence. Much like Pink Floyds ""The Final Cut,"" which after long scrutinization, I have deemed their finest album.This 1995 release, as a matter of fact, came out just before I travelled in Costa Rica, so I had this along with me. I remember watching Arenal Volcano erupt while I was listening to ""Strangers When We Meet"" on a portable CD player and smoking a cigarette and drinking a martini.Not like that makes me biased or anything....."
5,"Hallo Spaceboy, go Outside!","OUTSIDE, next to EARTHLING and BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA, is my fave Bowie album. from the ultimately tragic ""A Small Plot of Land"" to the kinetic ""Hallo Spaceboy"" to the techno of ""I'm Deranged"", OUTSIDE is a true musical journey. this and EARTHLING are Bowie's industrial albums. the version of ""Strangers When We Meet"" is much better here than on BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA. the story that goes along with it is a surreal slice of grotesque fun. buy this album and enjoy it!"
4,A return to form,"As a long-time fan, listening to this album was above all a tremendous relief. The man is back on form again. Finally. There are lots of good tracks and a few bad ones, but on balance a very good album that I listen to a lot."
4,A great album worth buying ONCE,"Not only do I consider OUTSIDE Bowie's best album since 1981's SCARY MONSTERS, OUTSIDE is my current favorite Bowie album. I recommended it without hesitation to industrial rock fans, Enophiles, and anyone who appreciates dark, adventurous sounds. However, if you already own the original pressing, there's no need to buy this album a second time. The remastering offers no improvement over the original edition's superb sonics. As other reviewers have noted, the reproduction of the digital booklet art and Bowie's cover painting are markedly inferior to the original digipak. The bonus track is a throwaway. I would have preferred to see OUTSIDE reissued in a deluxe edition with a disc of live material from the OUTSIDE tour, which included blistering versions of ""Look Back in Anger"" and ""Diamond Dogs,"" as well as electronic arrangements of vintage songs such as ""Andy Warhol"" and ""The Man Who Sold the World."""
2,Very hard to listen to,"In general, I'm a big fan of insect noises (cicadas, crickets, etc.), and I've discovered that it's really hard to find good field recordings. So I was pretty excited about this CD, even though I'd never heard any of it; I was sure I'd love it. However... it doesn't sound at all like I expected. There is no soothing drone, no happy chirp, no peaceful hum. These insects make some impressive and intense sounds, but it's not something I enjoy hearing. At best, it sounds sort of like an AM radio that's not tuned to anything, but more often it just sounds like high, piercing shrieks of feedback. Genuinely painful, even when listened to at a reasonably quiet volume."
2,the fact is,"that this is not a Japanese amine. It's Korean. I'm a Korean and I'm not too proud of this production. But I could give you some reasons. The director of this film is one of the best comic book makers in Korea and well-respected in Japan, and this was virtually his first attempt at anime production. The project started ambitiously, and it was supposed to be backed up financially by a company with a lot of capitals, but the short-sighted company cut the budget down, and the director had to work within the given budget. I've read the original comic book that came out around 1988, and I still remember it as one of the better comic books I'd seen. Maybe if the Japanese anime production company could pick up the story and redo it, it could become much better. The story itself was great. It's just that the great storyline was not very well depicted on the screen with a lot of cuts. (It's originally over 10 comic books.) Wish it were better, though."
5,A Shockingly Good Effort,"For some reason, I decided to not bother with King Crimson after Three of a Perfect Pair (perhaps I was angry with Fripp for disbanding an incredible group of musicians). Anyway, I picked up THRAK out of curiosity, and I have to admit that I was blown away by this disc. The complexity that is revealed after multiple listenings makes this a must-own for Crimson fans. One would think that having two drummers, two bass/stick players, and two guitarists would clutter up the sound, but the dynamics of these six artists interacting are incredible. I will never tire of listening to the frenetic opener ""VROOM"", and being transported to a higher plane by the peaceful ""Walking On Air"". The sequencing of the songs on this cd is part of the brilliance of this group. ""Dinosaur"" is one of the two or three greatest songs ever recorded by King Crimson. Make sure you purchase the just-released 24-bit remastered version."
4,Great intro to King Crimson's Music,"Thrak was my first exposure to Crimson's music, and it turned me on enough to get into their older, classic albums. Artsy, psychedelic, yet also very much rock. I think fans of younger groups such as Phish and 5000 Deep should check this one out, they'll like it!"
2,Nothing new...,"I am not a fan of King Crimson but I do like ""In the court of the Crimson King"", ""Red"" and ""Discipline"". To me, King Crimson is often more in the ""noise"" category than music. This cd is a very good example of my thinking. Sorry, but it is my humble opinion. Don't take it too personnal, it is a matter of taste. I just don't like it."
2,Grating,Talented musicians. I found the songwriting on this CD to be sub-par. The overall sound is generally a bit harsh and grating (like fingernailss on a chalk board). Any kind of melody is generally lacking here. I appreciate the experimentation but think they would be better served with a solid compositional foundation.
3,Not Inspired and Overly Loud,"There ain't enough room in the sonic spectrum for all 6 of these guys to play music simultaneously. What came out is and was an ugodly racket. I don't find it appealing. When I heard them admit years later that when recording this they couldn't actually hear each other the way they would have wanted to, I wasn't surprised.Too much of the album is consumed by two extremes. One is ungodly metal that sounds like follow-up efforts to 1975's ""Red"" (a nice track, but who wants to hear more variations on that same overdriven sound?). Another is Adrian Belew doing peaceful little Japanese-sounding songs, most of which are totally dispensible. The two that work well are ""Dinosaur"" and ""Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream"". Those two are fine additions to the Crimson canon, but sound better on the live ""Heavy ConstruKction"" collection from a few years later with a 4-piece band (even though I slammed that album in review also)."
2,"not my first choice, look at other options","This book is not the best option for a newbie or for someone without access to Oracle. (***From page 12, you need an Oracle database and SQL*Plus to complete the exercises.)The book is written in a way that the material doesn't make sense without the hands-on. I see that the text includes a lot of exercises but I don't see screen shots.Last, my text actually seemed photocopied on the inside--the grayscale art seemed like it was fresh from the copy shop...not exactly what I expected.I wouldn't but this book again."
1,Too many errors!!,At least half of the code examples I tried would not run. It is really frustrating to have a training guide where you cannot trust any of the examples to be coded correctly. I am amazed anyone would give this book a positive rating.
3,Oracle PL/SQL reference,This is limited to the Oracle PL/SQL methodology. The data presentation does provide examples to assist in understanding coding. No z/OS references are contained.
1,Material is far too old!,"I'm returning this book because it's based on Oracle 8! We are migrating to Oracle 11 and I really need something much more up-to-date than a 10 year-old book. Unfortunately, neither Amazon or the the book cover make any hint or reference to applying to Oracle 8."
5,Great CD!,Just happened to be browsing Isaac Hayes cds and ran across this. It is old but fabulous. Great music from a time when artists made real music. I would recommend this to music lovers everywhere.
3,Good Show if you don't mind the............,"skimpy packaging.....it comes in a card board case, which is not what I paid for....I feel that if I'm going to spend as much money as I did, than I want the full shabang.....hard plastic cover provides much more protection for my dvd's than cardboard.....Have The Girls considered DVD's get scratched easily during delivery? No. Apparently not....because I checked for scratch marks and mine already has some that I feel are due to the packaging,lack of protection during shipping and handling.Also the way it's positioned, you have to pull it out with your thumb and fingers, and that's no way to handle a DVD, any expert knows that the oil from our fingers/fingerprints ruin your DVD.Other wise it's a really really good show. Too bad I won't see it amongst my other IG DVD's in my collection....it's so thin, it's like an LP.I'm a perfectionist. And I've been waiting for this since 2007. And feel that it wasn't worth the money or the waiting."
2,"Good design, flimsy glass handle","This product worked well, until about the third time I used it, when the poorly attached glass handle broke off as a result of a very minor knock. Way too fragile for kitchen use."
3,Not as effective as those with lower-placed spout,"I also bought this hoping to get away from plastic and because I liked a larger size. The plastic separator we had at one point cracked due to heat. The glass of this product does seem thin as others have noted but so far this is not an issue and indeed keeps the thing from weighing too much. I handle it with care!My three star rating is due to the fact that this separator does not separate as well as those with spouts that feed from the bottom. The position of the spout about 1/2 inch up from the bottom means that fat begins to sneak in before you are able to siphon off all the stock. So you either have to accept some fat in your stock or end up with a mixture of fat and non-salvageable stock that you must discard. Maybe not a big deal to some, but inconvenient for us since our jurisdiction issues us a fat receptacle that is recycled and the extra stock means the thing fills up quickly."
4,Works really well,"The only knock on tnis is that the cup is a bit small for what you're paying for. Other then that, it works great"
1,expedition,half way thru the movie it lost most of the pixels. and skiped the rest of the way. poor acting. i wasted money on t his one.
2,This album has unusual vocals,"My dad got me this c.d second hand and when I first heard the first 2 tracks, it didn't really seem that interesting to listen to mainly because the lyrics are very hard to interpret and you can't find the lyrics anywhere in the c.d infold or anywhere on the Net. On the song ""Ray-O-Vac"" I couldn't really hear the chorus that well, I think it goes like this (""God will put you up on the Ray-O-Vac. God will put you up on the Ray-O-Vac. On the Ray-O-Vac on the Ray-O-Vac). The main vocalist (Jennifer Harrema) has a very peculiar voice; She sounds like Sweety Bird hollering (A character from the early 1990's cartoon show Tiny Toon Adventures) but this style of voicing is used consistenty. I would enjoy this album more if I can find the lyrics on the Net."
1,Disappointing!,"I came across this DVD while surfing for ""nude workouts"". It should have been called ""Topless Posing Amid Workout Equipment"". None of the ""exotic"" creatuires actually work out and none of them actually disrobe. If you are mainly into breasts shot in different poses from different angles under theatrical lighting, you might like this. But don't expect ""nude workouts""."
1,This video is guilty of false advertisement.,"This is nothing more than a photo shoot amongst gym equipment. Each model starts out with an outfit and then they work their way out of them (to a sleep inducing soundtrack). Unfortunately, all you ever get to see is them being topless. Which is nice but if they're going to give you your so-called 'fantasy workout', wouldn't you think it would go all the way? To their credit, the models are wonderful to look at but after putting the DVD away, I found myself forgetting that I even had it."
2,A Good Book Ruined by the Commentary,"I rated this book with 2 stars because the illustrations are many and clear. Unfortunately, this pompous author ruins what could have been a very educational book (wasn't this the purpose? And if not should this not have been the purpose?) by adding his own negative and sarcastic comments about equipment that he personally deems inappropriate. It was shocking to me. Particularly so when a young equestrian student of mine, enthusiastic to learn as much as he can about our sport, was disappointed and saddened by author's pointless remarks - commenting that the author 'sounded angry'. To Amazon and the publisher I would say - I'd like my money back but I don't think the book is worth the postage to return it."
3,"Not bad, but not outstanding","I got this game thinking it'd be a fun ""naughty"" game for couples, but it really doesn't fall into that category. As another reviewer stated, the ""naughtiness"" really depends on the people you're playing with.One player is the ""Pick-up Artist"" for a round, and draws a card, reading one of the two pick-up lines (examples being ""Hey, what's your nickname?"" and ""What did they write under your yearbook picture?""). Other players think of a response, write it on a piece of paper & stick it in an ""olive"", which are then placed in a tumbler & mixed. Each player (beside the Pick-up Artist) takes an olive & reads the response. The ""best"" response (as judged by the Pick-up Artist) gets a ""kiss"" token. The first player to get 10 ""kiss"" tokens wins the game.All in all, it's not a bad game, but it doesn't live up to the ""adult"" category. Also, it definitely depends on the creativity of the players, and the ability to come up with witty responses on-the-spot!"
3,"Ok, If you have the right people.","Yea, so i brought the game to a get together and the first thought was 'boring!'. but then we tried it and it was so much fun. we ended up laughing all night.it does bring out the daring in you. It is a good game 'IF' you have the right people."
1,Not up to par with previous writings,"Not only is this writing not up to Missy's normally good writing, but the overall story is a dud! There is really no action as in the first two books, and her Dar character is getting just a little to imperalistist. There are much better books out there then this one to cost so much and be such a dud."
2,Lame.....but nice for Aimee Sweet fans....,"The back of this DVD promised ""lap dances"" and ""dressing room sex."" However...this is not the case at all. No lap dances...no hijinks...lots of solo dance routines and same lame female/female scenes....Aimee Sweet is featured throughout though, and she's pretty fine."
2,MEGAN MASON'S SCENE IS REASON TO AT LEAST RENT,"Pet Of The Year 2002 Megan Mason an all natural brunette is a delight and its a shame she has one short solo scene. This DVD however is decent it features 3 other models,names I don't know I didn't care and this DVD does show a lot at times but some of the stages can suffer from bad lighting at times,however most were up to par. One thing is you will not see this amount of skin at your local strip club and you will waste a lot more money then just paying a small amount [of money[ for the DVD. I SAY WORTH A RENTAL BUT I WOULDN'T ADD TO MY COLLECTION,DARK AND DISAPPOINTING OVERALL"
4,A Children's Thriller?,"The Grey Lady, I would think, loves strawberries. But so does the Strawberry Snatcher(hence, the name). One possibly scary morning, The Grey Lady buys some strawberries and is soon being followed by guess who? The ""Snatcher"", of course. The Grey Lady soon realizes that she has a stalker after he attemps to loot her strawberries.This begins the game of hide-and-go-seek that really makes the books fun. The Grey Lady easily wins the ""game"" and the Snatcher is left alone. And what do stalkers do when they are alone? They develop new things to love. In the Strawberry Snatchers case, the new obbsession is none other than blackberries.If you think about it The ""Snatcher"" isn't such a BAD, bad guy(or E.T. hopeful) he's just out looking for strawberries to steal and eat, while working an that foot fungus. Notice the mushrooms growing after each step he takes on the sidewalk."
5,My children love this book!,"This is one of the most innovative books I have ""read."" My six year old brought it home from her school library and had no trouble ""reading"" it to her three year old brother. After the book was returned to the library my 3 year old kept asking for it. The story is wonderful and mystical. The art work is FANTASTIC!! I purchased it for a friend and intend to purchase it for my son."
2,Gave me bad dreams,"I vividly remember looking at this book in the school library(back in 1987)and had several nights of bad dreams afterwards. It isn't necessarily scary for most people, but for a child who has not been exposed to sinister images it may be quite creepy. I was raised in a home without television, thus I had very little exposure to scary images as a young child. If the child or children you are considering this book for are uncomfortable with creepy stories, then I would recommend passing on this one for now. Many of Molly Bangs' other books are wonderful."
3,Wordless and scary,"This book tells the story of an old lady&#65533;s nightmare. One day, she went shopping in a crowded market somewhere in the Middle East (other shoppers included a woman in Middle Eastern clothing on a skateboard). A mysterious stranger saw her buy some strawberries, and began to follow her, in order to steal the strawberries. The stranger followed her into the woods, up a tree, and through a bramble. Fortunately, the bramble had blackberries, which distracted the stranger and allowed the old lady to get home to her family safely. The story is told entirely in pictures, and there are no words in the book. The pictures are very rich with detail, and evoke the dreamlike experiences of the old lady."
2,This book scared ny 3-year-old,"When we read it, he seemed okay, but twenty minutes after lights out, we heard him crying. My husband went in to see what was wrong, and little Tommy said, ""Daddy, the strawberry book is scary. Put it in jail."" Jail is a big plastic bag in my room where we put scary books, videos, and action figures so they can't hurt us. Now, I'm not saying everyone's kid will be scared by this book. But if your child is easily frightened by ""mean guys"", as mine sometimes is, you might want to give this book a second thought before purchasing it. At the very least, check it out from your local library first to see whether it passes the scare test for your kid."
1,baffled by 5 star ratings,i found this to be a truly creepy children's book. i wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 5 years old. it is visually very unappealing. i'd return it for a refund but the shipping would probably cost me more than the book.
2,angela's review of grey lady and strawberry snatcher,This book was a great picture bok but it would be better if it had words for a story in it. I can understand why it is for ages 4 and up because younger kids wouldn't be able to look at the pictures and make their own story up for it.
1,I Don't Get It,"I'd love to understand all the superlatives used for this book, including from the person who gave it to me. My toddlers were scared by it and never ask to read it. To me it also seemed eerie and witch-like."
4,Campland,"When we get annoyed at Solzhenitsyn's lack of insight in contemporary politics (for instance, when he applauds the Russian intervention in Chechnya), we can turn back to his depictions of life in the Soviet work camps and delight in the fact that he used to be different (when the ruling was an enemy suiting his conservative and slavophile ideas, as one is tempted to add).'The Love-Girl and the Innocent' is a brilliant play about the inhuman world of the camps, that have their own rules, and where nothing of the world outside matters. The 'Innocent' is a newly arrived prisoner, who still bears idealism and is reluctant to adopt the camp techniques of survival. His love for Lyuba, one of the many women forced by circumstances to sell themselves for privileges and rations, tempts him to compromise with himself and betray his moral and emotional loyalties."
4,Brilliant -- as usual,"There isn't much to not like about a Dears album. Except that they all tend to sound the same. That isn't to say they're not all great, but there's no significant evolution -- at least none that I can hear -- from album to album. This isn't a bad thing but, considering the numerous changes in personel over the last ten years, it is rather odd.Gang of Losers is no exception: some great songs, some okay songs. If you liked the other albums, you'll like this one -- probably just as much.I loved it!"
2,Gang of Losers Indeed,"I heard a song on the radio by the Dears, and it sounded like Morrisey. So I bought this album. But this whole album is a bit of a snooze for me. Not very melodic or interesting. I guess it could appeal to some. But for me it was a very poor effort."
2,Save your money,"Very poor latency, crap software. I do not recommend this at all. I ended up buying a $2 -1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter and running my guitar straight into my soundcard through the microphone jack. I downloaded a copy of Mixcraft 5 (highly recommend) which comes with the Shred Amplifier suite, and now my laptop is a virtual live recording studio with zero latency issues."
3,Decent Guitar-to-USB interface with some flaws,"I have two laptops at home - a macbook and an HP; my intention was to use it with my media laptop (the HP) which is running windows 7 64-bit. This device seems to be incompatible (as of the date of this review) with this OS. I also have a macbook however, and I didn't even install the driver or the software (just used it with garageband) but it worked fine. Since there is no pre-amp or anything, the signal was a bit weak but can be tweaked to a pretty decent sound with some configurations via Garageband.I can't review the software as I did not install that on my macbook and to be honest if you have a mac you are probably comfortable with Garageband already."
2,Not user friendly (to me),"I followed the directions - or at least TRIED to. Directions did not seem clear. The device looks like it SHOULD work well, but I had no real success with it."
2,More Complicated Than I thought?,I love the concept of this item however it is not plug and play at all.I still don't have it figured out so I can't use it yet. But I know from othercustomer reviews that the thing works pretty well once you figureout how to configure it. I'm not giving up yet! Documentaion andsupport ate lacking. Not for you if you want plug and play! May be foryou if you're smarter than me :-)!
4,I like it,"For the intended porpouse, this USB interface does the job as simple as it is possible with a very good sound quality. Nevertheless, ASIO installation procedure is not that easy and energy XT software is not that obvious."
5,"Excellent complement for a ""laptop studio""","This interface works perfectly out of the box on my Linux system. Integrates perfectly with guitarix (a tube amplifier simulator). No need to install or compile a single thing, just plug the UCG102 to an USB port, plug the guitar to the UCG102, launch guitarix and start to rock!"
3,Good product,I bought this for recording my guitar playing through pc. It's a good product and the quality is good but the software that came with it was not what I was looking for and most guitar modeling software was very expensive so maybe will look for some other software.. But as far as the UCG102 goes it's good and is a good interface for pc.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,I bought this and it took a long time to get going on my recording software. Very frustrating. I'm not into writing bad reviews but this just didn't get the job done. I wanted to recording myself and guitar but the head phones only worked for one ear when i plugged it into the interface and i thought i might have been my head phones but i tried another pair on my ipod and they both worked on both ears. don't waste your money and your time. Get a better interface. I'm returning mine.
5,Nice Device,"Excellent interface between my acoustic-electric guitar and GarageBand (Mac). Equally excellent is the tech support, since the device is no better than the human using it. The tech wizard I spoke to rescued this perfectly functioning device from being thrown into drawer and becoming landfill eventually. He walked me through the audio computer configuration for recording music, which really is different from listening to music. I had missed a step. (Another review mentions this: go to the audio/midi setup utility and configure it for what you are doing at the moment.) When that didn't work, he had me describe everything I was using, from instrument to computer, and identified my problem: wrong guitar cable (I had a 3 point connection cable with an adapter, rather than a 2 point). After a quick trip to the store, I was recording. Thank you Behringer!"
1,Aggravating!,"1. Confusing instructions.2. Poorly labeled setup files (which driver do I use for Vista 64?)3. NO phone support. No US contact numbers that I could find.4. Annoying online support ticket system.I just received this and have not yet been able to get the drivers to work. This is supposed to be plug and play... it definitely is not! I'll probably figure it out if I work on it, but that's not what I thought I was buying."
3,Doesn't work as well as I'd like it to.,"I had hoped this thing would help me connect my guitar so I can record directly using Sony Acid Music Studio. Well, it does work, but due to a technicality, it doesn't work as well as I'd like it to. I have to keep switching the selected audio devices within the software; otherwise I can't hear what I just recorded right away. Plus I had to download a driver from the manufacturer website so the USB interface can work with Windows 7 ... and the driver isn't free. Nice."
3,Serial key native instrument software,"I purchase your product a few days ago, and the serial key for the native instruments software is not working."
1,Not recommended for W7 Users,"Not recommended for W7 UsersBehringer UCG102 Guitar-to-USB InterfaceI hate this product because it's made for the wxp, WTF!!!"
5,Perfect for practice,I use this to practice at my computer to keep from disturbing my wife when she is studying or my daughter when she is sleeping. Great little box!
3,Meh,"It came in earlier than expected which is a pluss, but the software that came with it was incompatible and confusing to use. Otherwise, it is a great product that I can use for my Guitars, bass, and keyboard."
2,Dissappointing - especially the software,"The hardware does what it is supposed to 5 out of 5.The software is appalling 0 out of 5.After some google searches I found various free demo software packages that allowed me to use the device to record on my computer - took me a couple of weeks of googling and reading various forums to understand what I was doing and feel comfortable. I was an absolute novice at digital recording using the computer.Buy the device and throw away the software - its worth the $25 just for the hardware alone - then join a forum like Reaper to find out what to do next. Or alternatively just google ""virtual guitar amplifiers free downloads"" and you will find various user groups that way as well.Bill"
1,Too Old,"It's old, with new computers you don't need this device, you can connect your guitar with 1/4"" (6.35mm)male to 1/8"" (3.5mm) male cable. comes with old driver and software. most of the new software don't detect this devise."
1,This thing just doesn't work,"I have tried and tried to use this device. I have been able to use it to record one guitar track using Multi Track Studio software, but since then have had no luck. Sometimes I can get it to work just to play my guitar through headphones, sometimes not. It just has too many glitches to make it enjoyable to use. I have had professional help trying to get it to work, and it just isn't working the way it should. Just plug and play? NOT!"
1,Do NOT waste your money!,"Absolutely awful product. No support except for useless help manuals. If you are looking to plug in a guitar to your comp and record tracks, you are out of luck. It just doesnt do that, not from anything I have tried. The native instruments guitar pack would be nice, but the website you click on to register for which free pack you want doesn't even exist! It doesnt matter anyway because the Audacity program doesn't do anything.Just an absolute rip off. I can honestly say, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a product."
4,Learning Tool,"I purchased this item for my young teen aged grand daughter who is learning electric guitar. She is using the basics to record her lesson homework which is a great help as she doesn't need to compete for school resources. I expect she'll figure out how to use the rest of the software as she progresses with her lessons but as a simple easy way a complete novice can record a sound clip, the Behringer UCG102 is doing an excellent job."
2,"44.1khz, software doesn't work under 10.7","warning, interface is 44.1 16 bit. thats REALLY lame. should be 48K 24bit minimum, and 96K capable.the software / amp sim that comes with this does NOT WORK under 10.7 / LION. OEM's website is a mess to navigate and figure out anything, and it appears they simply do not have a 10.7 compatible update out.this will work just fine with garage band after some software fiddling, and also works fine with apple's MainStage. in fact MS will automatically see it which is cool.a bit overpriced for the lame specs and software that doesn't work on a mac."
4,Works fine with a Mac,"Simple, easyPlugged it into a Mac, plugged the guitar into it, plugged in headphones, worked fine with Garageband. Sound is clear and no latency on my setup. Can't comment on the windows side since I don't have a windows pc to test against."
3,behringer usb interface,"the item looked nice,,well packaged,and a nice manual,but when i went to download,i found out its for 32 bit my pc windows 7 is 64 bit, i couldnt use it,i was going to send it back,,but after postage and the company charges a 15 percent restocking fee it wasnt worth it,so i still have it in box never used"
2,Not what I expected,"This acts as a sound card to directly interface to your guitar. Unfortunately, it only works with the software it's packaged with. Even worse, that software is pretty weak.The instructions are not helpful. The installation guide was over 450 pages, but it's in 15 languages. In the manual it looks like there is a control panel for the hardware device from the driver, but it's only through the recording Guitar Combos software.I'm returning mine for refund. I guess I have to go back to using my microphone."
1,"Impossible to use the software, WORST activation process I have seen",I tried to use the Guitar Combo software but the serial number printed in the CD cover did not work.Then tried to use online support but the site puts you in a mad loop that ask to login and informe the serial number again and again.Why the customer should be annoyed and punished to use the product?
4,Good product.,Does exactly what it was purchased to do. I can play my electric guitar through my pc. I would recommend to anyone who wants a low priced way to connect to their pc.
5,Great Product,"This was the first item I bought through Amazon, I use the program reaper and after a few adjustments the Behringer completely changed the way I record my guitar. I had no idea how much I was missing out on my sound quality for home recording until I decided to get this. I will be ordering another for two people to record at once. *** I have re-edited this post because it was a great device, but the part that connects from the usb to the Behringer UCG102 fell apart on me while picking it up one day, out of fairness that I broke it even though the wires were poorly soldered I bought a new one."
1,Didn't work with my Macbook pro.,I believe the software revision on the interface was down rev and not compatible with the Mac. Had to send it back.
2,Much worse then I thought,"I bought this to run my laptop with Amplitube for live situations. I am currently using my mbox2 and wanted something smaller. The latency with this is audible. It's not like you will have to run a test to see the latency, your brain will wonder why it does not hear sound after it hits the string. I know there are a ton of ways to decrease latency on the computer but the fact is that I was running the mbox without problem. Just to make sure I hooked it up to my desktop i7 2600k to see if that made a difference and it did not.It seems some folks love this thing but I don't know how.I did not check to see the latency if I were only recording so I suppose it could be ok for that. I doubt it though."
1,I cannot get to work at all !,"I purchased this as a christmas present for myself to help with my picking up the guitar again after a very long layoff.I just cannot get it to work at all !I have an Win XP laptop,1Gb ram and a 100Gd HD.I was excited about tooling around with the included software.I loaded,then unloaded it after it did not work.I downloaded asio4all driver,the device lights up,but no Behringer control panel! I even opened up a new forum topic here hoping for help from someone so far no luck! I cannot of course contact Behringer(the website was no help!)I am not a computer wiz but I also am not dimmy dimwit on a PC either ! I am VERY Disappointed ! I was so looking foward to playing and experimenting with the UCG102 and the software !................................Crushed for christmas"
4,Behiringer ucg102,good product. bought this for my son and haven't heard from him therefore it must being OK and working. good service and follow up.
2,Not using it,"Good software and all but if you dont have a good sound card,you can forget about doing fast picking on heavy distortion.Its either clean and laggy or noisy and and keeping up with the picking.I wouldnt buy it."
2,"Great Idea, Terrible product.","If something looks to good to be true, it probably is. I was very excited when I bought this item, being into recording using programs such as cubase 4, hypersonic and protoolz etc. I thought this would be a welcome edition to use along side my midi keyboard.Boy was I disappointed, the compatibility with this little item is terrible, whether you have a Mac, windows Xp windows Vista, it doesn't matter, it's more of a hassle than its worth. You can not get it to work properly on Cubase using a top of the line mac, even after trying to install the asio drivers countless times. I have also had to reinstall the drivers and restart my computer every time I wanted to use the software it comes with on my Desktop computer.It just is not worth the money or time, wait a bit for something more polished, I'm sure in a few months there will be one out there 10x more efficient than this.2 stars was being generous."
2,Not Worth Buying New,"This Device it not worth the money. ASIO driver crash alot, you must reinstall the drivers every time you use the device. Your better off saving the money buying the M-Audio Fast Track USB.If you really want to buy this or you are on a low budget buy this junk used."
4,Good Product,"I tried this eyeliner for the first when ordering the Vital Radiance Face Primer. As an older woman, I have problems making a continuous line across my ""not so smooth"" eye lid. This eyeliner seems to be a little better than the other ones I have tried. Not bad."

2,Estatico es la palabra que mejor lo describe,"Debido a que vivo en Bruselas not tengo la oportunidad de leer mucho en espanol, sin embargo trato por lo menos de acercarme a uno o dos libros en mi idioma natal por ano. Este no fue una buena eleccion!Arturo, presenta la historia de un Pintor atormentado por su vida como fotografo de guerras pasadas, el cual solo piensa en el amor perdido y utiliza su arte para huir de la realidad que ahora lo rodea. Para tratar de poner un poco de "" color "" en la historia Arturo incluye a un Croata loco que busca asesinar al Pintor, por puras estupideces....Definitivamente un libro estatico, sin mas drama que el cual puede fabricarse con muchas y muchas palabras vacias..."
1,El pintor de batallas,"Nunca antes había leído a Arturo Pérez Reverte. Muchas personas insisten en que lea sus novelas de aventuras. La mayorían me recomiendan ""La piel del tambor"".Yo he empezado por ""El pintor de batallas"", porque me lo regalaron. Me ha parecido un libro altamente pretencioso, poco madurado, precipitado, de una verborrea huera. Demasiadas palabras para tan poco que decir. Párrafos y párrafos de reflexión autocomplacida, reflejo de una realidad más ansiada que imaginada.Hacía tiempo que un libro no me había provocado tanta repulsa. Aunque, por otro lado, el alucine de que un autor tan aclamado pudiera haber escrito esto, me mantuvo muy entretenida. Desde las primeras páginas, me llevó la curiosidad de ver hasta dónde el autor podría llevar el fantasmeo del reportero de guerra."
2,Outdated,"This video originally released in 2000 is outdated and has modified its title to add the global warming line. The science, while good, leaves questions where we now have answers. I would have recommended this 7 years ago, I cannot do that now."
2,The Truth...Interesting,"If you are expecting an academic work of art, you might be highly disappointing. This book is more of a pamphlet than a book.It should be self-evident that the original Hebrews were not Caucasian. However, Hughly's attempt at scholarship is as questionable as the conclusion; that being the African Americans and Blacks are descendants of the ancient Hebrews.I would purchase it to gain insight into the sects that attempt to promote the notion of black national revivalism through the co-opting of a well established religion as a means to gain a semblance of identity. However, for the serious student, I would ensure that you pursue more fleshed out versions of the well documented history of the Jewish people. Such as Hayim Ben-Sasson, or Paul Johnson."
4,Great playing!,"This is great playing. It's not excellent playing. Janet always gives a wonderful sound. The ensemble is flawless. She chooses such perfect tempi.But I wish she would ornament a little bit. It's all there....except for ornaments. Therefore, I give it four stars for my disagreement in (some of) her interpretation."
2,not a good book in my opinion,"I personally found this author's prose difficult to plow through, perhaps because of the abundance of sentences without enough commas. His prose simply doesn't flow. But that's probably a problem only I'd find. In any case, this book does raise a few good points that I find insanely inconsequential."
1,I don't recommend this book,"The authors often lose plenty of time talking too much.I do not recommend this book to anyone, although one can find anything interesting it is not necessary to read the whole book to learn the new concepts."
3,Some redeeming qualities,"I'm in the industry, I went to school for game design and it seems like this is very targeted at the large team development process. This book is padded with thoughts of the authors and hypothetical conversations with the reader that are often filled with tangents that probably should have been cut by the editor. There is some great info in the book especially if you want to work for a AAA company and are new to the game production scene. For those in small teams where roles as designers, artists and programmers blend and or those in short term development cycles where you don't need a 40+ page GDD (game design doc), you will plow through the book once and it will probably sit on the shelf and collect dust.Grade: C"
3,Falkland War,A different approach to the Falkland Island War. The authors take you on tour of the of the conflict from start to finish with out being opionated. This should be read by those who want a quick understanding on the conflict/
2,I did not order this item,"I did not order this item. All I wanted was 1 copy of the 2006 Time Info Please Almanac.I received 2 copies of the 2006 Time Info Please Almanac, and 1 copy of the 2005 NY Times Info Please Almanac. Why would I want the 2005? Because it is too much trouble for me to try to get my money back or sell it to someone else I am giving two copies away.But I will never, never again order anything through Amazon. And you can count on that. I believe Amazon is pulling a fast one on unsuspecting customers.Elinor Lynch"
4,Lots of pink fun!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had purchased a playboy dvd a while back thinking because it has Hot beutiful women it will be a good dvd BUT NO!! I thought it was just as bad as a cheasy cinamax movie so naturaly I was very sceptical of this Penthouse 2003 play off dvd.Let me tell you, It gets hot as hell from the very first 10 seconds of the first scene with Suzzanna Spencer. The whole dvd maintains a sexy feel to it the whole way though. I highly recommend it!!!This is not a porn dvd but there is Plenty of pink and fun with fingers with a little bit of insertion. I think even though you've been jadded by the hardcore stuff you will still find this dvd hot.It would get a perfect 5 out of 5 but all it has is a chapter selection and a gallery. Where is the bonus content? there arent any trailers or any thing!!"
2,Leave It On The Shelf,This one is a let down. Linn Thomas looks completely worn out. Devon is the only thing worth taking a look at in this video; and she doesn't look that great in it. Save your money and turn on QVC. You'll get off faster!
4,Getting better,"One of the few things that saves this film is Linn Thomas. she makes most of the other girls look like amateurs. She looks amazing in the vid, thats obviously why she is the main attraction on the cover. Other than that, the some of the sets are interesting."
3,ne pas acheter,comme la plupart des dvd penthouse de lannee 2000 pas recommandemble lasiatiaque ex playboy lynn thomas qui est tres maigre qui auparavant etais jolie dans playboy trs dommage
4,Introduction To Fluid Power,"This book is a very good book for the fluid power student as long as they have a little algebra under their belt. Covers subjects well without a lot of empty reading and pretty easy to understand.The only problem I have with it, there is no glossery and the index is not very complete. Other than that this is a book I will definitely keep for a reference guide down the road!"
2,"Review for HR ""Singing in the Heart""","The first two tracks are excellent (5+ Stars). However, the rest of the CD is not very good. Since the first two tracks are so powerful I reccomend this CD, but it's a lil pricey for two tracks."
3,Ok,This was a present my daughter recieved at Christmas from her grammy. She immediatly ripped the CD player off the book and it left a huge spot on the front. She likes the player and the cds more than the book. It was an OK gift but i wouldn't have bought it myself.
3,Not as Expected,"This product was a bit misleading. I assumed the music player also told the story while the child followed along, it doesn't. The music is fun for younger kids but the story is way to hard for a younger reader. My 4 year old Neice loved it but couldn't work any part of it herself. I'd say it's age appropriate for 8+. Also, it's a bit expensive for basically a story books that plays some music. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,not great,2 of the discs hardly play the disc player doesn't close all the way down to play the discs. its very frustrating. would not buy this again.
3,Disney Princess Music Player storybook (Disney Princess),"This is kind of a dud. The music is sometimes longer than the part you read to it, so you have to wait for the music to end in order to continue. The stories are okay, but this is one princess storybook, that I actually have a hard time getting my little girl to pay attention to until the end."
3,The music is a hit,"Friends of my parents gave this to my three-year-old daughter -- I personally don't buy any of the Princess stuff myself -- and she immediately went bananas for the music player. We basically ditched the storybook, since my daughter doesn't know who any of the princesses are and I'm in no hurry to read inane stories about them, and let her play with the music player. And that part of the toy has been an unqualified success. She loves that she can operate it all by herself, since she is not otherwise supposed to touch CDs or our stereo, and likes acting out what *she* thinks the songs are about. So, in that way, it has become an imaginative toy for her. And the small snippets of classical and Disney music on the CDs are perfectly pleasant to be around. It's great for keeping our daughter occupied in the car, for example."
1,Misleading,Each princess 'cd' advertises one of the most popular songs from their respective movies. My kiddos love the songs so I bought the book. I was very disappointed to discover that the 'cd' only plays approximately the first 5 seconds of the title song and it is just a revised instrumental version hence the title of my review: Misleading.
4,"Lovely toy, But somewhat disappointing","I bought this for my 3 year old daughter today, and she absolutely loves it. She learned how to position the ""CDs"" properly in the player within 5 minutes, and she's had a blast with it all day- I'm positive she will play with it for a long time. My only complaint is that the songs are only short instrumental snippets. I was under the impression that the songs contained lyrics- that they were the actual songs from the movies- but they're not. Thankfully, my daughter is only 3 so she doesn't care about that and loves it just the same. The Music player has a cute little handle so the child can carry it around- I really like that feature. It's a very handy little toy. The book is beautifully illustrated, but the stories are pretty simple. Then again, this is meant for a small child, so it's not like they're expecting Shakespeare lol, it's all about entertainment. All in all, it's a very cute little set."
2,"Worth buying out of curiosity, and thought that it was a neat toy, but frustrating to play with!","The discs must be inserted a certain way in order for the player cover to close and it to work...While this may teach my daughter coordination & motor skills, she doesn't like pushing the Play button to play the next song...Maybe when she grows (she's only 2-years-old right now) she will enjoy!"
2,"Good start, feeble conclusion","The often reliable Stanley Ellin seems unable to follow through on a sturdy revenge premise here. The first half of the book sets up the protagonist's betrayal by his fellow criminals; when he miraculously comes into a large fortune, we are prepared for a ""Count of Monte Cristo"" style masquerade and ingenious trap-the-trappers finale. Alas, as soon as our hero shows up (disguised) in his old haunts, inquiring about his previous persona, the villains panic and kill each other off without even a last word or a shock-recognition-regret scene. A lot of careful scene setting and plotting goes totally to waste by the end."
2,or 1.5 star for lil or no horror,"lax enough monsta action; the jeannie ghost, the girl monsta & brief unknown thing was barely ok. lousy, retarted collection; not exciting enough."
2,SKIP THIS THIS IS NOT J-HORROR,"Oh man, this is really (...)!!!I rent this DVD,I REALLY, REALLY glad, I rented it didn't buy this Crap! I thought this series of GHOST stories come from J-Horrors. Would be real shocking and scary,Gory. That's what u expected from j-horror!!..It was looks like our TWILLIGT ZONE series was made for TV have silly special effects..Kind of slow pasted stories little silly suspense here and there..Just lame! Wasn't scary at all!. . Definitely SKIP this, It just wasting time and money, I was wondering another review from ""THOM"" Did he really SAW this movie or someone told him about it? ..He gave this movie 5 STARS????? LOL!! U TRIPPIN DUDE!!.B"
5,Very highly enjoyable,"My older daughter has told me again and again about this Japanese actress and singer. When she played one of her songs for me (not on this CD), I was convinced that this woman stands out among a lot of today's singers, especially here in America. Her voice and especially the music aren't only beautiful, but also exceptional: when you compare her to people like Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears, Mika's voice and music make theirs sound even more overrated than they already are. The music itself is a well produced mix of 'easy-listening' ballads and rhythmic jazz songs, which might bring to mind songs from the 1980s and even as early as the 1940s. Thus, my children and I agree that this is an exceptional recording."
5,I'm not a J-Pop listener but...,"Although she's more so-called 'adult contemporary' than the music I listen to, she has a lovely voice and style that you don't see very often.If you like the J-Pop genre then you probably want to give this album a listen."
3,"I LOVE IT, but- IT DIDN'T PLAY?????","To start off, definitely finish the series. It really is an awesome story. Although the anime only goes to about (I think) book 6-8(?) of the 23 book manga-series, it's a good thing to have if you are a fan.My problem was that I put in the disc, it wasn't scratched at ALL, it looked absoulutley flawless-including the case- but it didn't play. All three of my DVD players either said ""No Disc"" or ""Invalid Region"".I don't know what's up with that, but it seems the others who bought it had no problems.If anyone has an explanation as to why my disc/T.V./DVD player did this, I'd be delighted to hear it.Otherwise, yes, it's an awesome product and you should definitely own it."
3,The Last Piece,All in All it was good. The only thing that dissapointed me was that the story just kind of ended. I think it should have been longer. The last episode was exciting. There was a lot of action in it. I felt there was a deeper relationship betweem Toru and Kyo but we never really get to see it. Like I said all in all it was enjoyable to watch. I suggest that if you have seen the rest of the anime finish it up with the last piece of it.
1,Missing Episodes,I heard someone say that this anime is only 12 or 13 episodes i have 26 episodes this dosent make sense to releas the series only have done and call it done. thats why my rate is so low now the full 26 episodes are the best i love them and cant wait for the manga i hear its a lot better. ^_^!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Beautiful!,I actually was so happy with my manta that I purchased two. it is charm bracelet size and just beautiful. I am very happy.
1,Terrible Movie,This movie was terrible. It was poorly made. It looks like a homemade movie and you can see the girls blinking and breathing after they were suppose to be dead. I would not recommend this movie for anyone no matter how into this stuff they are. It's just terrible.
1,"Please, Don't waste your time or your money","I rated this movie 1 star because that is the lowest rating I could give it. It actually deserves less. A lot less. The acting is horrendous, the plot worn out, the special effects are, well, rotten beyond belief. I would not recommended this (for lack of a better term)""movie,"" even as a curiosity. If you want to see a better movie, but still a cheap movie, you'd be better off seeing THE GREAT AMERICAN SNUFF FILM. At least the actresses in that one are good looking, andyou can find something to make you feel sorry for them as victims. With this movie, the only person you'll have any feelings for is yourself, for having wasted money, time and brain cells on this, quite possibly the worst movie ever made. And I don;t mean that in a good way."
3,not for everybody,well this is a cheap movie a little bit crazy but interesting if you like murders snuff sexe etcwell it is no funny at all and very disturbingbut it is a low budget
4,For thoses who are looking for the orignal opennings,"Hey I found out how you can watch the orginal opennings and endings of DBGT. Go to textless opennings under the bonus material section. Watch the US version click on the next button your DVD remote, and you should get the original openning of GT after you pass the US ending version. I'm not sure if this works on all discs, but it does work on the 5 disc of GT, it doesn't seem to work on the 6 Disc"
4,Overall very good,The set of cookie cutters is made very well. Most of the cutter shapes are easy to work with and the sugar cookies held their shape after baking. The only exception was the heart with an arrow. The arrow ends are too thin and constantly broke both before and after baking.
5,Blackberry 8700c Extended Battery & Cover,I would recommend this to anyone. I have used this battery for over 3 months now. My actual talk time exceeds 4 hours even though 3 emails systems receiving about 300 emails a day. It also re-charges quickly. The new cover works as expected and I find a bit easier to remove than the orginal.
3,WAY too short for the subject matter,"This was probably the shortest Sunfire, clocking in at a mere 170 pages. The subject matter really calls for one of the larger volumes, and while Miner is usually adept at creating a great and thorough story within the shorter length, this wasn't one of them. Usually the heroines have an arc and development, but Corey's character is pretty consistent. She always doubts the ability of Ned, another slave, to judge with common sense and when he fades from the picture, it feels like his whole character took up valuable time that could have been spent making Corey and her migration to Philadelphia more effective. None of the characters have much depth, which is a shame, given the serious subject of slavery and the responsibilities of emancipation."
1,Have heard it works but BEWARE of the ingredients - Formaldehyde,Formaldehyde is in most nail polishes but it doesn't mean you should ignore it's danger. It is a known human carcinogen.[...]
2,didn't like it,don't use it. don't like the way it looks like on my nails before polish and no appreciable difference after I used it.
5,THE BEST base coat I have found.,"This is the second time I purchased this product since i`m still very pleased with it.It`s is great for keeping your nails from turning yellow after all the dark nail polishes we tend to wear sometimes.It gives a very nice, smooth surface to work on. I highly recommend it."
3,The jury is still out,"I purchased this product a month ago and I can't judge how well it should work. After I apply, the nails are smooth but the ridges are still there. My nail polish goes on smooth and nails feel ok. Sorry I can't rate this product a 5 yet."
2,Brittle Nails Beware,"I had to give it at least two stars because it is effective at helping nail polish adhere without chipping. However, if your nails are prone to peeling or chipping, this will make them more brittle, dry, and prone to peeling. Switched to Nailtiques #2 and it helped them recover."
4,Great for men too,"I have horrible nail ridges, always have, and lately it's bothered me. If I get a manicure, I always ask for them to file them away and I get advised not to do that because it'll weaken my nail. Then not only will I have ridges, I'll also have weak brittle nails. So I've lived with it... Until now. This stuff is in no means a miracle cure, but it does lessen the appearance of ridges. It also dries quickly to a matte finish, so it's undetecable, perfect for men who want groomed nails without the shine. I've only had it for a week, so I can't comment on the claim of stronger nails, but so far I'm very happy with this product."
2,Not on Parr with The WIngs of Dirty Angels,Not terrible but certainly a dust collector for me. I love his first album and always wish that there was anotyher gem of his out there out there. This was not it.
5,Finest record I have ever heard,"I wish everyone owned this record. I have also had the pleasure of seeing Terrell and band perform live as well. They are it!! He is a cross between Tom Petty and Steve Earle, with a little Tom Waits thrown in there. ""Angry Southern Gentleman"" is the best record I have heard since Bob Dylan's ""Infidels"". I believe the artist currently lives and performs weekly in Los Angeles. I hope he has a new record coming out soon!"
3,No Instruction,"Decent singing and dancing, but zero instruction. ""We'll teach you how"" actually didn't at all. Try ""Hip Hop Shop"" to see the difference."
2,"Not good, but your kid will probably like it","For an adult, this video is painfully bad. For my 18-month-old daughter, it is a pure delight. It's not good singing, it's not good dancing, and it's not good acting, but your kid will probably like it, too. Somehow, it does actually get less irritating with repetition, which is good because my daughter wants to watch it all the time."
3,Daughter does not like it yet,"This just does not catch my daughters attention at all, not one of our favorite kidsong episodes."
2,Boring!,"My kids had no interest in this one (neither did mom!) Unless you like formal dance music, this is just of no interest to little kids. Bad choice for a kids video! The ""Day at Old Macdonalds Farm"" video in this series is a lot better!"
2,mis-begotten,loved the trailer.film was dispointing though. with the time and energy taken to create this surreal nightmare the director could have at least utilized his obvious artistic skills to make the violence more realistic and less hokey. a superior camp film that would have been much more compelling and important if misdirection had been applied and some of the more beautiful shots (the seeming waves behind a lense deformed creature's lurching for instance) were held onto as lovingly as the (intended) disturbing images. a real let down for the price and hype.
3,Weird,"Weird is definitely a good thing in my book. This fits the bill, however, I found it to be somewhat tiresome after awhile. Yes, it does indeed make ""Eraserhead"" look like ""Ernest Saves Christmas"", but the minimal soundtrack and extreme closeups of god-knows-what tend to get annoying after awhile. Some of the scenes seem to go on FOREVER. However, the opening is definitely very stark and provocative, but unfortunately from there, it alternates between interesting and ""next!"". If you are looking for something unusual and hypnotic, this isn't bad, but I found another movie, ""Decasia"", very similar but much better."
3,Eraserhead this is not!,"This film, alternately boring and compelling, is a work of pure symbolic imagery. I do not know what I would have interpreted it to mean had I not read the sleeve of the video. Unlike my favorite film of all time, Eraserhead (a film with which it will inevitably be compared), Begotten made no attempt to connect the abstract, yet gorgeous, images to a reality with which I can identify. While Lynch's work takes an average man (average, at least, in the world in which it is set) and adds surreal elements to his slow crawl toward insanity, Begotten is practically ""DaDa-ist"" in its unrepenting lack of human connection. I gave this tepid piece of pretention three stars, and would own it, simply for the imagery. It is some of the most beautiful I have ever seen."
5,Ontological archtype!!,"Karl Jung, Wilhelm Reich, and G.W.F. Hegel obviously didn't tell us all that they knew. This film strips being down from the societal bigoted elaboration into collective subconscience. Anyone who says this film is boring or pretentious isn't in touch with the zeitgeist of the universal weltangschunng!"
1,How about those Red Sox!,"Yeah, well gee. Uhmm, aaahh, ok. What about those Red Sox? As for this movie, well, aahh, gee, uhmmm, aaahh I watched as much as I could and tried to think of any saving grace to recommend it. I could only come up with one and that is I found out how the dream tape in The Ring was made. The rest of the movie, if you can stomach it, is a very disturbed student film. I tried to visualize the interpretations that the other reviewers got out of this movie and either it is too deep for me or it is like Picasso, who I've always felt was putting people on and making a living by it. If you do decide to watch it, and there are at least 10,000 movies I would recommend before you do, don't watch it while you are eating."
1,One star is far too generous!,"As a fan of alternative and surrealist cinema, I eagerly searched for a copy of this film after reading the glowing reviews fellow ""art-house junkies"" were giving it. After finally finding a copy at a local video store I almost asked for my rental fee back! Sure, this film is art, if your idea of art is 45 minutes of blurry, hooded figures dragging an epileptic Christ-figure across a barren landscape in slow motion! The first 10 minutes are interesting, if not mildly stomach churning (not necessarily a drawback), but after that the film becomes redundant and dull. I was bitterly disappointed, as were the three other art-movie fanatics I had invited over to watch it. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you want something experimental, go back to the early b/w short films by David Lynch. Heck, even a Kevin Costner movie would have been better! (well.... not really, but you get the point!)"
2,BORING,"The trailer states that you can't get through begotten without being marked. Well i just watched it, and i wasn't marked. in fact the only thing that i thought after i saw this movie was, ""i will never get that time back."" If your in the mood for a boring, drawn out movie, begotten is your movie."
1,Tiresome,"I remember watching this in college. I like finding movies off the beaten path, but don't believe this is so far off the beaten path, please....really it tries too hard to offend and mystify, succeeding in neither. It is a laughable movie....a pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-controversial, avant-garde parody dragging a body and saying nothing. Such a squalid attempt at shock and revelation made me laugh, and eventually weary. Try 'The Exterminating Angel' or 'Picnic at Hanging Rock', both bizarre and disturbing in much more refreshing ways."
2,"""Gother than thou""","Yeah, remember those kids who wore silver ankhs so big they would make Flava Flav cry? Yeah, so they made a movie. This thing plays out like a Bauhaus video that wont end. If it was, say, 20 minutes it would be good. It has some creepy imagery, but it goes on WAY TOO LONG. As it stands, it warps space and time in some kind of moibus loop of pain. I couldnt get drunk enough to enjoy this movie. Pretentious and overdone. Did I mention it goes on forever?"
5,Simply Incomprehensible,"This movie deserves either one star or five, so I've given it five. It's not as offensive as others have said because the images are so difficult to discern that one's imagination is forced to fill in the details. If gore and offal are what's desired, the viewer would be more satisfied with one of dozens of low-budget splatter flicks. Perhaps 'Begotten' shouldn't be considered a film at all, but a series of black-and-white art photographs arranged in a semi-random order. The picture on the cover is about as clear as they get. It has a plot and a story, but without the notes that are provided I doubt anybody could know what they are. I enjoy the movie for its extreme artfulness (artful in the sense of being a product of labor), but I haven't been able to watch the entire thing in one sitting. One must be in a certain sort of mood (chemically induced or not) for it."
4,A true metaphysical splatter film,There are no words spoken in the film and it is fitting that one can say that no words can truly describe this film. A truly metaphysical terror film that has to be seen to be appreciated. Easily one of the most unique films you will ever see. Much like Eraserhead but even more bizarre.
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"It's midly interesting, but way too long to have to watch the grainy black-and-white ultra-high contrast image. In the extra features, it is discussed how it took HOURS to achieve this effect; hours that could have been better spent. It's not nearly as esoteric or surrealistic as it purports to be; and certainly not enough to warrant the price it's going for."
4,2 MAJOR FLAWS BUT WELL WORTH A LOOK,"it's all been said really. an excellent experiment in cinema. very abstract. you shouldn't necessarily try to find reason or order where there is none, so in watching this you can make up your own story. much like some of david lynch's work. i would emphasize that the latter portion of the film drags ass. it could have been cut here n there but that's just my opinion. and also if the score had recieved half the attention the images did, this movie would be a ten star rating in my book. either way, if you have a curious eye and interest in surreal/exprimental art, then you should own begotten."
2,Could've been....uhh...,"Maybe it could've been a good short film. If you don't like grainy, deliberate ""art"" films, don't even bother. If you do, you will still probably find this ""film"" overlong and tedious. It had an interesting style and a pretty good opening, but absolutely dies after 5 minutes! Oh well. If you like intentionally psuedo-spiritual weird cinema, try finding Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""Holy Mountain"" or Werner Herzog's ""Even Dwarves Started Small"" instead. Cheers!"
3,Would have been great as a short film,"This is one weird movie -- and by no means in a bad sense. The strangeness is the film's greatest strength: the bizarre wordless narrative, the deranged assortment of noises on the soundtrack, and the arresting speckles and graininess of the cinematography.Had the film managed to sustain the intensity it built up during the first ten minutes, it would have deserved all the accolades it received. Unfortunately, the movie devolves into a pretentious film-school mess after its promising start. Pacing and shape are all but lost as we watch the Epileptic Jesus character being dragged around while spitting up raw meat for several hours (or so it seems).Those with no interest in avant-garde filmmaking should run away screaming from ""Begotten."" And even those like me who enjoy dark and disturbing film fare should be prepared for a hefty helping of boredom along with the good stuff."
4,BEWARE!,"This video's evil I tells ya, EVIL! I have never seen something so crazy as this. I loved it, I hated it, I don't know how I feel about it. I just have never seen anything like it. It opens with a grainy image of a bloody zombie-like thing with guts hanging off of it and just decends into even more craziness. I recommend it just to see it, because even if you hate it you'll be able to talk about it for weeks."
5,A FUN FILLED MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY,"begotten is a movie for the whole family, my kids love it.i make them watch it 3 times a day"
3,nether fish nor fowl,"Begotten is artistically one of those moving targets, that by design keeps your brain at an arms length from any point of connection. Yet the mind being what it is persists in trying to make some connection, then slips into a state of tranquilized submission, occasionally aroused by images too visceral or sexual to ignore. Some will give up, doze, daydream, critique, or remain with a glassy-eyed focus.Are 10 minutes of Begotten more or less rewarding than the full 70? I think the Charms Tootsie-Pop ad put it best ""The world may never know"" Because no matter how long you watch you will drift in and out, such is the nature of ones reaction to the willfully obscure.For the record, I took it in with one swallow and really have little else to say, based on what I've said you should know yourself well enough to decide if this is for you. It's not the kind of film one recommends or condemns across the board."
1,boring,I wish I would have rented it from somewhere instead of spending my money. Does anyone want my copy? [9/7-I gave the copy away]
1,Yuck,"Didn't care for them, they were very dry and not chocolatey enough. My daughter said they weren't too bad. i won't be buying them again."
3,Joseph's Cookies,I would say these cookies come in real handy when Idon't have the time to bake my own. My husband nixedthem right away. I might think twice next time becauseof shipping charges.
5,"Just as good as ""urban hymns"" but louder!","The loud, psychodelic guitar work is what holds this beautiful album together. It is spooky, dark, and rocks more then ""urban hymns"".I disagree with the previous review, this is NOT ""way better"" then ""urban hymns"", just rocks more and is more energetic, but perhaps not as pretty and dynamic. I DO reccomend ""urban hymns"" too.BOTH albums are excellent which is unique, as most bands struggle to create back to back masterpieces...The Verve have done it with the rebellious ""northern soul"" and its more mature, ""urban hymns""....Buy both of them. If you have to choose, buy ""northern soul"" for a louder album, ""urban hymns"" for a prettier albu."
5,A definite MUST for any Verve fan!!,"This album is one of the best Verve albums ever, rivalling even Urban Hymns. To appreciate it however, I'd start with Urban Hymns and work your way down to this... it really shows how diverse and great this band really is...Which reminds me that The Verve have officially broken up, as of April 28, 1999."
3,A big noize!,"The Verve are a great band with great potential, but this album is just drowned in noise, its terrible.When you listen to it you you realise that the music is so badly produced, that your ears are focussing on the sheer volume of the music instead of the actual music.Great band, but a badly produced album."
4,Better hymns,"I really think that this is the stand out album from the verve. A northern soul really defines their sound, whereas Urban hymns looses it slightly (with the exception of Bittersweet symphony, the drugs don't work, and lucky man- one of my favourite songs ever. I would definitely recommend that everybody should own at least one verve album, as their sound defies many cliche'd genres."
5,Sermons and Soda Water,The titles of the volumes in this set are:I. The Girl on the Baggage TruckII. Imagine Kissing PeteIII. We're Friends Again
5,Super-Sweet,"I find myself turning this film when I can't sleep and need a little cheering up... What a beautiful documentary!Done with music of the day, chronicling Warhol's life through those who knew him, it's a quick and fun sweep of imagery, inspiration and nostalgia. What stands out for me is Warhol's penchant for being able to mix with different kinds of people from all walks of life. He was by no means perfect as a person, but he was special, with a knack for teaching himself how to celebrate life. Certainly he is an exemplar for anyone who struggles and wants to make his or her way in the world!This film will remind you to be thankful for being alive."
3,not for those with an irrational fear of burglars,"Ms. Blyton wrote an estimated 800 books. So, if you read a few of her story collections, after awhile you'll notice some stories which repeat with minor variations. One is the tale of a burglar outwitted by various toys, kittens, dogs, elves, fairies, or possibly squirrels.This is one of those stories. The ""burglar"" is just a neighborhood kid with a ladder, but my little one does not want to read or hear about homes being violated, especially at bedtime. Older kids who are more interested in tales of true crime may not want to read books about cute kittens."
5,WARNING!,"First, If you read this book, make sure you don't have other things planned because you will not put it down when you start to read it. That is my warning. It made me keep reading. It's a series and it's like the Fearless series, my favorite, only different. Maybe that's because Vanessa is a moon goddess but she doesn't know it. Vanessa has to find out what's going on because she'sgot someone chasing her. She thinks they want to put her in a cirucus! Her best friend Catty thinks it is a guy with a crush on Vanessa. After awhile she knows the reason that she is not like everyone else. She doesn't believe it at first. Everything gets worse for her but the ending is really good. She has to use her power to fight evil of the Atrox and its Followers. I like the ending."
4,"Daughters of the Moon, yay or nay?","This book is about four teenage girls who are gifted. They each have a ""power."" Together they are known as The Daughters of the Moon. But they cannot let other people know about their ""gift"" because then they would be publized. There is a ""bad guy"" called the Antrox. He and his followers try to defeat them and claim thier unique powers.Well this book was Fantasy, so it wasn't very realistic. When I first started reading this book, it moved very slow for my taste. It was like that until about halfway through the book. But now I am glad that I read it because it really picked up. I am looking foward to reading the rest of the sieres!This book wasn't really like any other that I have read. But I really enjoyed it."
3,Better than the cover,"This book was better than I thought it was going to be, the cover made me think it was going to be completely campy and all about current trends. It definately is aware of current trends. I was very pleased with the Greek/Roman mythology that it uses for its basis. And when the book is focusing on the main character and the drama of a teenage girl dealing with problems it is very entertaining and enjoyable. However when the book takes on a broader scope--the character ""Maggie"" being the most problematic for me, it looses my interest and I became very aware that I was reading a very campy book. It works best when the characters are just accepting that they have powers and don't try to explain them, once the book trys to go into the reasoning of the powers it really looses me and I find it very silly. However, if I have time I will most likely pick up the second book because I did find it enjoyable brain candy and not completely drivel."
5,loves the book,"This is the first book of the Daughters of the Moon series and is on Vanessa'a POV. Vanessa is a normal girl living in Los Angeles the holder of a secret that she never told anyone not even her mother which is the ability to become invisible. because of her strange gift Vanessa feels that someone or something is following her and she fears that it is connected to her gift and that her biggest fear is she has finally been discovered. little does she know that her life is going to change forever. She is destined to be a Daughter of the Moon, girls who were born a moon goddess and are daughters of the moon goddess Selene and that they must fight the ancient evil called the Atrox and its Followers who are bent on destroying the Daughters to take over the world. As Vanessa finds out more about her destiny she must find a way to rescue Catty who was captured by Followers and tell her of their true destiny. This is one of my fave books and i cant wait til the becoming comes out"
5,I Love It!,I finally read this book after hearing great things about this series and I was not disappointed!! This was an awesome book and I can't wait to read the rest of this series!
5,WOW MUCH BETTERTHAN I PREDICTED,"Wow! You can never judge a book by its cover! This is soooo good!If you think you're not gonna like it, you're wrong! It's really godd. I started reading it, and I couldn't stop!"
5,Intreging,"This book was just going to be the next book I read but after the first book I bought the second and so on and so forth. When I got to the eighth book I thought that was it, then I found at the end of the book "" Look for the next..."" and I was so happy. This is a must read for anyone who has an interest in special abilities, the abnormal, and the supernatural!"
5,Vanessa.... Goddess?,"Vanessa Cleveland wants a normal teenager's life. The only problem is getting there- and that means NOT turning invisible. Vanessa has the power of turning invisible and she soon learns that she is a goddess, along with her friends, Catty, Jimena, and Serena. They each have their own powers that can help win their battle against the evil Atrox. Besides trying to save people's hope, they also try to win the luv of people that have stolen their hearts. Will good prevail, or will evil take over their sanity?This book was excellent! The plot was thrilling, and the characters were well described. Ms. Ewing does a wonderful job of describing the outfits and scenery in the story, and her imagination is great! For those of you who are looking for a magical adventure that is very realistic, you should definitely read: Goddess of the Night."
5,"Amazing! For me, anyway, but I'm only 14","This series is a whirlwind of magic, mystory, romance, and suspense. It's hard not to fall in love with these characters.In ""Goddess Of The Night"", we come into Vanessa's life, an average teenager with one huge secret-she can become invisible. It's made her life a hassle, but she has her best friend of all time, Catty there with her. Catty can time travel, and the two often wonder about their supernatural powers. But then, one night, Vanessa is walking home from a dance club, when she hears somebody following her. She doesn't know who, but she knows why. And now she's about to be trust into a world more dangerous than ever.These books are all about the Daughters Of The Moon, and I highly suggest it. But what do I know? I'm only fourteen. If you don't belive me, read them yourself!"
5,magical and unique,"This was a really fun read. Vanessa is a amiable and strong main character, who has a secret she hasn't even told her mother. She has the power to become invisible, but all she wants to be is the normal teenager she appears to be. But when she is being followed, and her best friend dissappears, she learns the truth about herself. She is a godess, who must fight evil and return people's lost hope. I'm looking forward to reading more books in the series, and I'm going to recommend it to my friends who like to read books that are unique and magical"
5,"Goddess of the Night, Daughters of the Moon","Goddess of the Night, was a first in what I believe to be an excellent series. Lynne Ewing, the author, uses so many details and descriptions... you can't help but let your imagination take you there. I highly recommend this book."
3,"Interesting, But Predictable","Vanessa Cleveland is your average 15-year-old, with your not so average ability. You see, Vanessa can become invisible. Whenever her molecules start buzzing, which happens the most around gorgeous Michael Saratoga, she disappears. Her friend Catty, has a strange ability too. She can go back in time or into the future. Between the two of them, and their new found friends Jimena and Serena they've got to find out why this is happening to them, and save not only themselves, but the world as we know it.This was a somewhat exciting book at times, but really dragged on too. I don't think I'll read the other books in the series because of the disappointment in this."
4,Goddes of the night-beginning of good series,"Great book, encourages girls to find their own warrior spirit within. Vannessa is about to find out a secret that will change the way she sees herself forever. She is about to find out that she's a goddess of the moon. Along the way she will meet three other girls who just like her find out that they are different, together these four unlikely friends will form a bond that will help them fight the evil atrox who is bent on destroying them...The only complaint I have with the books is that right now you can only buy the books in hardcover (hopefully they will come out in paperback!) , the covers are beautiful but at the price their at I've only bought 3. I'm not a teenager anymore but I feel sorry for the younger ones who have limited amounts of money to spend."
3,boys & magicks,"There are 4 girl goddesses- each has her own power- invisibility, time jumping, reading minds & esp- it sounds cooler than it is.I like to read teen-y books sometimes just to see what's going on out there, and this book had no emotional impact whatsoever. Sure, the girls are on the outside a bit, hiding their magic- but all of the cute boys still like them, & the evil they face is confused and muddled in description.I admit, I'm guilty, these books are so easy to read that I'm going to go ahead & read some more of them- mostly to see if they get any better-(...)"
2,Unoriginal,It was an ok read. It has a typical story plot and the story didn't flow the way I would have liked it to so I could enjoy it. It was ok...
4,A Magical Reading Adventure,"A plus side to this book is that it is like no other. Original, suspenseful, and ingenius. I'd read this book a second time if I were not anticipating the other books in this elaborate series. I reccomend this book for those who love idenity conflict, magical suspense and a taste of good old-fashioned romance. ""She started to shiver and she wasn't sure if it was from the cold or fear."" The main character, Vanessa, can't come to tell her mother about her ""special"" power that enables her to become invisible. Her best friend Catty, a time-traveler, is her only confidant. Together, they meet others like themselves and learn that they are the Goddesses of the Moon. They must work together and fight to overcome the devious Atrox! I cannot wait till I get the rest of the series."
3,"Good, but could be better...","So far I have only read the first book and just started the second. It's definitely different from a lot of teen books out there, which sets it apart from most. However, I felt that this book could have been made even more interesting if the history of the daughters of the moon had been explained a little better. Okay, they have powers. Cool. But why? And when did they get them? Were they born with them? Why were they chosen as daughters? None of this is really explored in great detail, and that's too bad. I hope in the following books it is. Still, I would recommend this series if you like Charmed or Buffy or other supernatural stuff like that."
3,Dissapointed,"I read these books when I was in 8th or 9th grade. Even though its been a few years since, I still enjoy teen fiction. I never finished the series and decided to finish it now-starting from the beginning. Not what I remembered. The context is very easily read, which i thought at the time as well. Its choppy and lacking emotion- some parts are interesting and the story line is good but the choppiness and low level of vocabulary limit these books.The problem is, while the writing is very simple- the context isn't completely appropriate for say- an advanced 5th grader. It seems the emotions that are described vividly in this book are lust and attraction. Empathy, fear, and other easily related emotions for the level of writing are not as focused."
4,an ok story,"this story begins with our first of goddess of the moon vanessa. she has the power to become invisible and just hates this because it makes her diffrent. her best friend catty can move through time. catty thinks this is a totally cool ability to have. but when circumstances beyond their control arise, they learn that they are not only goddesses but that there are others like them and a legion of evil doers out there that will do anything to stop them. this book is the first in at leas 9 books and the author does not leave you hanging and waiting for the next one. for all you adults out there, this book was a bit too childlike for my tatse. some adult fiction should be labeled for adults but this one is definitely for the 14 and under crowd."
4,Library perspective,"If I were to pick up this book to read personally, I'd be disappointed--for all the same reasons various adult reviewers have given.On the other hand, I have the perspective of working in a public library's Youth Services department, and youngish teenagers are gleefully devouring this series as quickly as they can secure copies. If you're considering purchase for a girl age 12-14, you'll likely miss an opportunity to nourish her on higher-quality literature--but you're also likely to get enthusiastic hugs of gratitude, an encouraged reader, and a lot of excitement from your happy teen. She'll be thrilled!"
5,Great Baby Gift,"I have bought this edition of ""The Real Mother Goose"" a few times as gifts for new parents with their first baby. They have each enjoyed the soft cover, great old-time rhymes/poems, and illustrations -- a great way for them to start bonding/reading to their children EARLY!!! I am sure to purchase it again."
1,Kindle Edition--Two Thumbs Down,"The Kindle Edition of this title was rushed. No care was given to layout of the pages and looks terrible on every Kindle reader I use on a regular basis. The publisher needs to take more time instead of just supplying the entirety of the whole book as one (1) page; total disregard for page breaks, titles are frequently orphaned at the bottom of the preceding page to the nursery rhyme."
3,all mixed up,I purchased this for my kindle and the first 4 rhymes are all mixed up. There are 2 Titles then 1 line of the first poem then 1 line of the 2nd poem then the next line of the 1st poem and so on and so forth. Also although it says there is a table of contents it is blank. Other then that the book contains what I remember as a child. If I could navigate it I would have given it a better review.
3,My favorite but only because I grew up with it,"This is the Mother Goose that my generation grew up with. This gives it the advantage of containing the rhymes my generation recites with ease. However, if one looks at it objectively, the order of the rhymes is often a result of poem or picture size rather than a comfortable flow ... the equivalent of a DJ ordering the songs by the color of the label. [insert your own argh]The pictures were quaint when I was growing up. They will continue to appeal to some children but those children will need to be selected careful.This is a good Mother Goose for Grandma's house but there are better to give the child."
3,Not what I expected,I expected to receive the same book for my daughter as I had when I was a child. The stories have been hacked into one liners/stanza and miss most of the story. I will return this item and seek the 'complete' mother goose as not to have samples or bits of the rhymes.
4,Old Time Classics Never Die!,I remember this book as a child & now I am sharing it with my children & their grandchildren. Classic Nursery ryhmes never get old!
4,Wrong Description,"the description stated the book had an interactive function - "" feel the horse's silky mane and the Dog's red suit"" this is NOT the case. The book does not include any fabric."
5,The Real Mother Goose Board Book,"The Mother Goose board book is an ideal first book for a baby, so Mom and Dad/Gramma and Grampa can read to them.It's sturdy so even if it gets chewed on a bit it will stand up and it has many of the original Mother Goose rhymes. I gave it asa baby gift to start off the baby's library."
3,Quality just isn't what it used to be,"I bought this for my future child, I remember reading this as a child myself, and have some pretty fond memories. I couldn't find the copy I grew up with so when I saw that I could order this, I was ecstatic. The hard bound cover is nice, and good enough... but the paper quality is extremely cheap and thin, the reprints of the original illustrations have less quality then the sunday comics. Oh Well, what do you expect with merchandise sold and made today.It would be nice to have the option to pay extra to get the quality that you remember from days of old."
4,almost perfect,"This collection is quite nice with only one rhyme and illustration per page. I think this layout is superior to layouts with multiple rhymes per page as it helps little ones and beginning readers to focus. The only thing I didn't care for was the cover. It is a padded hardcover which looks cheaper and seems less sturdy than a regular hardcover. However, it is still my top pick for any nursery rhyme book."
4,The Real Mother Goose,The book was a favorite of my daughter's when she was a child and now that she is expecting her first baby it will make a lovely gift for her. The condition of the book is excellent and I know she'll enjoy reading to her daughter as much as I did reading it to her.
5,child pleaser,"What is to say about a classic? We have the origional I bought when my son was born 40 years ago this is for my newest grandson short, sweet readable stuff to make a baby giggle"
2,Creepy and Weird,"This collection of nursery rhymes is a little creepy and weird. The rhyme about shooting ducks in the head was something I didn't really feel comfortable reading to my son. There are several that I remember from childhood, but overall the rhyme and meter don't match and the meaning is sketchy at best.I DO NOT recommend this collection to anyone."
2,Not Great,"I bought this due to the positive reviews, but was disappointed. Some of the nursery rhymes are not the same as in other books and many I had never even heard of. In addition, this is extremely long and not a good choice if you have a child who will make you read through the entire story from beginning to end in one sitting."
1,These are Some Messed Up Rhymes,"I'm shocked to see that these books are still selling today. I had this exact book when I was little, and my mother brought the old copy to me cause she thought my daughter might like to have it. I don't think I'm going to bother giving it to her. I was frightened by this book when I was little. Mother Goose looks more like a wicked witch, stealing a baby, on the cover. There are tons of nursery rhymes, but most of them are very obscure, some only a couple lines long. And maybe I am reading too much into them, but a lot of them seem full of sexual innuendo and possible drug references. One titled ""Robin and Richard"" seems the most questionable, about two grown men staying in bed until 10 o'clock. I'm not prejudiced at all, but this seems like a very strange rhyme for children to be reading. Everything about this book is disturbing to me."
1,Thumbs down,Most of the rhymes in here are so foreign to me. I never heard of most of them and don't even understand what they are about! I had a hard time keeping me interested.
5,exellent refernce,"I have been teaching Taekwon-Do for the last three years now to both children and adults,ranging from people just interrestet in the fitness aspect of the sport to people currently on the national team. This book covers all aspects of instruction and student managing that you will need. To me alot of the contens was not completly new, but even the things i already knew was put into a system that made it easy to relate to and i know for sure that buying this book has had a positive effect on my instructor and coaching skills, wich my students have benefitted from. It covers a lot of teaching methology and alsoe includes a chapter on the buisness aspects of opening a martial art school, with budgeting and practical things that you have to do in regards to ensurance, advertising and much more."
4,A Great Book for Instructors,"This is a great resource for martial arts instructors. It goes over everything from teaching methodology to curriculum development, and from student management to equipment. I thought that this book was very helpful when I was teaching martial arts. It is well organized and easy to read. It covers many business practices which apply to any business, not just teaching martial arts.Overall, if you are just starting out as a martial arts instructor or are thinking about becoming an instructor, I think that you will find a lot of useful information in this book and that it will be an aid in starting your classes and staying organized. The start up worksheet alone would be very helpful to a new instructor. Even if you have been teaching martial arts for years, this book probably contains some helpful tips which you haven't thought of before. Check it out...it is a good resource!Bohdi Sanders, author of Warrior Wisdom: Ageless Wisdom for the Modern Warrior"
4,Good Book for beginning instructors,"I was searching for a book that would not change the style of teaching that I am learning from my professor. And I am pleased with what I have read thus far. As an apprentice instructor there is no way to gain the full 30 years experience of my professor in a few years. This book has some nice ideas, some I may incorporate others I may not. I recommend this book to other beginner instructors."
3,is a tape...,did not realize this was a tape not a CD... music wise it is (of course) awesome! otherwise no issues
2,Not quite so good,"I wasn't impressed with this album. I understand it was the beginning before the released the acclaimable albums.This just didn't cut it except for ""Flower"" & ""Head Injury"". The rest of the album is kinda lame."
3,calm before the storm,"soundgarden went on to become one of the greatest bands ever in rock. they combine wailing vocals with distorted guitar to support dark lyrics. a meld of many most notably, zepplin and sabbath with some melvins thrown in, soundgarden do not really shine yet on this album. it is good but not great. this album is not very ear friendly as the production is raw and under produced.chris cornell had not yet grown to his true brilliance of vocal mayhem while kim thayil was still growing as a guitar player. hiro yamamato and matt cameron were, also, growing as a rhythm section. the songs are good but not great. they are gritty with an understated sound that makes this one cd to check out. i agree with the idea that if all you own is the ""great"" loud love and up then you are missing out"
2,it's just ok,"you can hear the seeds of later soundgarden songs. they really came into the sound they were known for later on with the album Bad Motor Finger. if you are a completist then by all means purchase this album. if you are just discovering Soundgarden and like what you have heard on the radio or where ever then pick up the later albums. Superunknown, Down on the upside, Bad Motor Finger all have the same feel yet they have their distinct sounds. you can really see where the band was going over the course of these albums. this album is not terrible it's just that the songs lack individuality and technical skill that the band would demonstrate on later albums."
5,Great movie only Dolly could bring us,If you are a Dolly Parton fan this is a must see. This movie shows her talent at oth acting and singing. What a beautiful voice! Will watch it again
2,Campy in the country,"Like a drag queen,this movie is melodramatic,wears too much make-up&is; over-the-top.Watching this movie before going to work at 4 in the morning,I found this a hoot.(If this movie were in theaters,people would be in tears---from laughing so hard!!)One of the gems is when Dolly's controlling boyfriend drawls,""A man is supposed to go after the younger ones,not the woooman!"" Put on a fake Texas accent&it; works.There's the Sappy Sequence in which Dolly meets with her mother,looks at photographs of herself,then gets a heart-to-heart with her pastor.Awwwwww...Did Thomas Kinkade ever get directing credits?Of course,one must suspend disbelief when the Handsome Young Guitarist falls for Dolly.For someone somewhere,they're an archetypal couple.I haven't found that someone.The movie has a hilarious love triange,enough melodrama for 10 Lifetime films--and songs to tie in with the plot,no less!It's country-fried soap opera!Come 'an get it!"
2,Just isn't doing the job,Was hoping to minimize bugs and keep my garden safe from harmful chemicals. This stuff just isn't working well and we noticed that it may be damaging the leaves. We've since stopped using it.
3,strange duo,"this is a 2 cd set from talking elephant. what it is, is the studio version of ""solid"" on 1 cd, and ""live at the astoria"" on the 2nd cd. the live cd is mostly stuff from ""split/thank christ"". there is ""3744 james road"" and ""down in the bottom"" to close it out. i'm not too sure why they put an available studio cd along with this live cd. it seems like an odd match, plus if you have ""solid"" you're only benefitting from the live disc. the set does come with booklet. so, knowing this, either get it because you don't have either releases, or be prepared to have some redundancy in your collection. also, the ""live at the astoria"" has been released as a dvd + cd package. and the dvd is excellent!"
5,Good fan,Easier than we thought to install. It's smaller than our old fan so drywall repair was needed. We installed it without even having to go into the attic. We lucked out a little - as there was plenty of wire up to reach the new fan's wiring box.It's pretty quiet and works well. Recommended - and the price is right.
4,Not quite enough,"Purchase for bathroom to reduce condensation resulting in mold. Didn't seem to have enough flow considering it was in a bathroom 1/2 the size it was recommended for. It's not too noisy, but not very quiet either. For the money, I think I got what I paid for and would probably buy another if I needed to. Fairly compact and easy to install for the handy homeowner."
2,Glitch on DVD disappointing...,"I love this show, and content-wise, I would give it a 4-star rating.But, as other reviewers have previously mentioned, the Japanese subtitles for episode 44 are, in fact, for episode 45. Everyone I know that bought the defective version of this disk, including myself, have made numerous attempts to contact Funimation concerning the error, and although they have acknowledged the error, they've done NOTHING to correct it, or publicly admit the disk was in error. That is why I am giving this disk such a poor rating.Otherwise, the series is excellent, with wonderful characterization, and the other, *unflawed* disks are a great buy."
2,A significant Problem,"If you prefer the English dub of Yu Yu Hakusho, in which Funimation inserts their own interpretations of how characters interact and adds their own lines in a way they consider humorous, then no problem.However, if you prefer the Japanese dub, with English subs that go along with the Japanese voice acting (Funimation inserts 2 subtitle sets into their DVD's; one for the original Japanese dub, the other for the English dub), then there is a significant glitch. Episode 44's subtitles for the Japanese dub are incorrectly coded with episode 45's subtitles. While it is possible to play the subtitles for the English dub, as noted above, it IS NOT THE SAME. Until Funimation corrects this error, if you prefer the subtitling that goes with along the Japanese voice acting, I recommending holding off on buying this disc."
1,A big difference,"This DVD in english version is really bad,because in the english version it's not even close with the japanese version.In the english version it's like they've made their own Yu Yu Hakusho.I'll prefer the spanish dub of the japanese version."
3,Good Stuff But Not His Best,"I've been a long-time fan of Wainwright's since someone clued me in on him in College, so I anxiously bought this CD a number of years ago to see what he had been up to. There are in fact some good cuts on this (""Father/Daughter Dialogue"" was my favorite) but I found the self-deprecation and confessional stuff was getting a little bit old, and some of the irony and wordplay seemed forced.For people who have not heard Wainwright before, I would suggest going with some of his earlier work, including ""Album III"" and ""Mustache.If you want a good, funny song -- something I still sing to my wife -- try ""Mr. Guilty"": ""Call me Mr. Guilty/Mr. Guilty is my name/I am the one/the no-good bum/that did it all to you/Oooohhh...."" You might also catch Wainwright on old re-runs of MASH."
4,Family Ties That Bind Us,Book arrived with in time frame and in good condition. Really enjoy ordering my books this way with such a reliable service.
4,Richardson spells out family intertwining well,"This quick read has many helpful explanations of the causation of family of origin relational problems. The specific questions are geared towards self-examination and seeing yourself in the family of origin model to help you gain an understanding of your own and other's character traits, sickness, poor communication, stunted growth and more. This book is great in conjunction with a family systems therapist who would lead you to our Father God who has provided everything we need in his son, Christ Jesus. I also suggest for immediate help with teenagers:Age of Opportunity: A Biblical Guide to Parenting Teens, Second Edition (Resources for Changing Lives)"
1,TOO LARGE,THIS RETRACTABLE LEASH WAS TOO HEAVY AND TOO BIG FOR ME. I HAVE A VERY STRONG 86 POUND GOLDEN RETREIVER SO I THOUGHT I NEEDED A SUBSTANTTIAL LEASH. THIS LEASH DID NOT GIVE ME MUCH CONTROL BECAUSE I'T WAS TOO CUMBERSOME FOR ME. I SENT IT BACK - I GOT THE FLEXI 3 LEASH INSTEAD. IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE AND ITS SMALL AND LIGHT. IF YOU DON'T MIND A BIG HEAVY CUMBERSOME LEASH THEN IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU. IF YOU WANT A LIGHT LEASH THEN I'D STICK WITH THE FLEXI 3.
2,Good service. Terrible product.,"I was happy with the service provided by the company. However, my dog broke the leash in one month. Product is overpriced."
4,Great Information!,"For the seasoned nutrition professional or the everyday exerciser, this book provides sound information which can help you realize your goals. The information in this book is not drastic, new, or difficult to comprehend, but generally overlooked for more cool and hip fad diets. There's a reason why information such as this has always been there and always will, simply because it works.Even if you aren't trying to manage weight for a sport but rather just for health, general fitness, or anything, this book gives you a good template to work with to realize your goal.However, this book can be a bit of a drag if you're not really into nutrition and fitness. Despite this, the diet templates alone are really worth the price of the book. I still say get the book and read it."
5,"Easy-to-understand, AMAZING book!","This book is amazing! I have bought 3 copies and have given 2 away as gifts to my fitness-savvy friends. The book is extremely useful, whether you're trying to lose weight or gain, or whether you're sedentary or athletic, although it's targeted to athletes - even to extreme athletes. It explains in scientific, but in VERY easy-to-understand language WHY you should consume a certain amount of carbs, protein, fats, etc, rather than just telling you in a more dictatorial way that you SHOULD do it. It explains metabolism, nutrient breakdown, meal timing, and more. Even as a personal trainer, I have found it to be a very useful tool on top of what I already know, because it makes it easy to explain to clients or friends why they should eat grains, at what times sugar can be ok, when to take your pre-workout meal and why, and much more. I'd choose this over any nutrition book I have ever read!"
4,Some good info.,"I felt this was a good book with some good info. Some great points are made regarding good and bad foods and supplements. It also gives great guidelines for adjusting calorie intake to achieve certain goals, with some good meal and smoothie recipes as well."
2,Only for beginners!,"If you are a beginner to the field of nutrition, this book will give you a good start. But for any one that may have some basic knowledge of nutrition and wants to further expand his/her understanding of the field, SAVE YOUR MONEY. I expected a lot more from the book but found it to be a repeat of many similar books (but with a different cover and advertisement). If you are a strength trainer, athlete, or involved in any serious workout/sports, I recommend Dr. Michael Colgan's ""Optimum Sports Nutrition"" which is by far a better book (maybe even the best book) in giving comprehensive and scientifically proved ways to enhance yourself. Dr. Colgan's book covers nutrition, fat loss methods, supplements, and even workout plans!! Good Luck!"
5,Great Memories,"I bought this as a vinyl LP when it was new in '72 after hearing a promo copy in the record store where I worked as a teen. I find it interesting that only one reviewer has even alluded to the originally intended structure of the recording (per the liner notes); it was almost totally improvised! ""The Lovers"" (the original Side 1) did have a basic structure, but was really a freestyle jam with a set hook and McCann directing around it from the keyboard and the players following his 'lead' and jamming freestyle on their own solos. ""Beaux J Poo Boo"" & ""Poo Pye McGootchie"" (the original Side 2)were somewhat more traditional compositions, but were performed in the same wide open, improvisational mode.I've been in awe of the final result for over 30 years. I find it mind boggling that a masterpiece of this caliber took so many years to make it to digital!"
3,adapter,The product works great when hauling a bumper mount trailer. We have had to use it to hook up our fifth wheel and it tends to come loose alot. Due to the fact that there is not a way to retain it in the socket.
4,Pretty Good,I remembered this video fondly from my childhood so I purchased it. My fiance and I use this DVD regularly to keep in shape. It is fun and we get a work out. The music is good and the people in the video are diverse. The only drawback is Richard doesn't always explain his next moves.
4,Disco Sweat,"It's a good workout, that's easy to do. You don't have to learn complicated steps like with some aerobics instruction."
2,Not as good as Sweatin to the oldies,"It is definately NOT as good as the original Sweatin to the Oldies. He doesn't seem to carry the same enthusiated energy. I didn't find following the steps hard at all, it was super easy to pick up. I apsolutely hate the beginning and you CANNOT fast forward it. It's cheesy and stupid and the people exercising with him DRIVE ME CRAZY with their facial expressions etc. I did this video twice and I havent' done it again. I believe it will sit and collect dust. Not as good as I was hoping thats for sure."
2,A work out designed for very out of shape people,"The music is modified familiar disco songs (most likely because the producers didn't want to pay royalties) and lacks the pep of the original music. The work out is designed for people who are very out of shape. If you are a fit or moderately fit person, you will need a work out with more movement to even break a sweat. I did not find this work out motivating or physical enough for me to do more than once."
1,Sad,"Bad, bad dance moves by a group of people who should stick to walking. While I applaud Simmons' efforts to get obese folks up and moving, I found him extremely hard to follow. He is not a good leader as he is stiff and gives almost no heads-up on the coming moves. I am in shape and fairly coordinated, but found this to be extremely frustrating. I really have no idea who this would be good for and would not reccomend to anyone. Please do not waste your money on this one!"
5,fun for all shapes and sizes,"This video has intervals of high and low intensity. It's great if you're really out of shape and want to start working out or if you want a pick-me-up after a day at work. I like it better than any of the other Simmons' tapes because it's a little more challenging. Richard is really corny, but if you can stand him this is a really fun and easy work out for anybody of any size."
1,Too complicated to learn and burn...,"I bought this DVD because I LOVE Sweatin' to the Oldies and Ithought this might be just as good. BOY! Was I WRONG. The movesare way too involved to learn and by the time you do, they're onto the next move. What a waste of my money and time."
3,OK,"Not as much fun as his other dvd's. Probably just a personal preference in my part. Again, I liked the ""real"" people on the dance floor."
2,expected more,"I was really disappointed in this dvd as I was hoping it would be harder than it is. I had read previous reviews and did not find it to be challenging as ""Sweating to the Oldies 4"". Looks like I'll be wearing that dvd out instead...although I may use ""disco sweat"" occasionally. This is another good beginner dvd...but don't expect much more."
4,My DVD purchase,"I was not sure if I would like this dvd or not, but I really enjoyed working out to it."
4,Disco Sweat Richard Simmons,Love the '80 tunes of Richard Simmons DVD. The steps ere easy to follow and very upbeat!!!
2,Too confusing,"I love Richard Simmons, but this workout is just too hard to do, and I am an old disco dancer from way back. It moves too fast from movement to movement so you are always behind. There are too many closeups where you can't even see what they are doing. It would help if Richard counted for you, but he does this in only a few places. It would probably be a good workout-if I could do it. It also caused a lot of pain in my feet and ankles even though I was wearing good quality easy spirit shoes.I really can't recommend it."
2,Richard Simmons is Fun!,"Any Richard Simmons video is so great and fun. But I was disappointed in the songs. I was hoping for more popular and motivating disco music. And the choreography is so similar to ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" that I was a little bored. Still, Richard Simmons videos are one of my favorite ways to exercise."
4,Fun to do,"A fun workout as you sing and dance along. You can have some fun, feel motivated and work up a sweat all at once"
5,Richard makes exercising FUN!!!,"I have several of Richard Simmons' workout dvds: Sweatin to the Oldies 25th anniversary edition, Sweatin' 5, Boogie Down the Pounds, Party Off The Pounds and Disco Sweat (I recently discovered Richards workouts and have been ""buying them up"" every since).I love them all but Disco Sweat is quicktly becoming my ALL TIME favorite. I love the music and the dance moves on the dvd. My favorite tunes are: ""Boggie Fever"", ""You Make Me Feel Mighty Real"" and ""Born To Be Alive"". Richard incorporates a standing toning segment and abdominal crunch routine. I like the fact that he has a cool down at the end of the aerobic segment and one at the end of the adbdominal crunch routine. If I decide not to do the crunches, I have cooled down enough at the end of the aerobics. I usually complete the abdominal work because Richard is most encouraging in this segment. It's like he is speaking directly to me. I LOVE this workout!!! Thanks Richard!!!"
5,Great when you get the hang of it!,"This is a lot like Sweat and Shout with Disco music. I was VERY confused when I first tried it. In fact, I was so confused that I didn't even break a sweat because I spent too much time trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. The second time I did it, it was a lot better. ""Shake Your Booty"" is so much fun! My 5 year old son does it with me because he loves that song so much.There's also 3 high-intensity intervals, which he never did in the ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" series. This is supposed to make you burn fat more effectively. I've lost 8 pounds in 3 weeks from doing this every day and I don't have a whole lot more to lose. It's a low-impact, high-intensity workout. You get the same workout without hurting your joints and back.Great buy!! I'd recommend this to anyone!"
5,Pleasantly surprised!,"This is my first Richard Simmons workout. I bought it figuring I'm either gonna love it or hate it. I was pleasantly surprised! There are so many things that I like about this workout! I love the music, all the songs chosen are geared towards positive self-esteem and self-acceptance. Richard Simmons is friendly and encouraging, not overly-enthusiastic as I would have expected. I liked that people of all sizes were working out, and everyone had wonderful energy! There are a lot of toning moves mixed in with the aerobics, which I wasn't expecting at all, such as plies for your legs and fly aways (I think that's what they're called) for your arms. Granted this workout isn't designed to give you a beach body, but it will give you basic muscle tone and improve your aerobic stamina. All the moves are low-impact, but can easily be adjusted to higher impact for those who are in better shape. This workout is a lot of fun and completely enjoyable!"
5,Great Cardio workout,"This is the first fun work out video that I have found. I'm 34 and I like it because it gives a good cardiovascular work out, but is not overly strenuous. It is also the first video that I've found that leaves me feeling energized afterwards instead of exhausted. It is a bit hard to follow until you get used to it, but keep going and you'll get the hang of it."
1,Embarrassed for my species...,"That's how my wife put it and frankly I have to agree. I think it was around about the third song on the DVD when in the producers felt that seeing chimpanzees dressed in bikinis (with make up and sunglasses), as mailmen, etc., would be a good idea. It wasn't."
3,We like the kidsongs,"We like the older kidsong tapes/DVD's - this one was ok, not one of our favorites though, could have been more animal oriented!"
4,Reminds me of my childhood!,I had all of the Kidsongs videos when I was a kid so I was happy to see that they're available on DVD. The songs can be kind of annoying and the videos are definitely a bit dated-looking (the outfits some of these kids are wearing are hilarious!) but my 3 year old loves it and asks to watch it all the time.
5,kidsongs!,I watched these when I was little!! I can still remember the songs and even the kids in the videos...I would watch them over and over again! I can't believe Kidsongs is still around! Now I'm buying them for my nephew- I'm sure he'll love them!
3,"Its pretty good for something from 20 years ago, however...","Its pretty good for something from 20 years ago, however, I was worried my toddler would get A.D.D. watching it because the scenes are constantly changing and erratic. My toddler enjoys ""Toddler Tunes"" and ""Silly Songs"" by cedarmontkids much more, these are modern versions with less flashing between scenes."
1,Terrible,This DVD was the corniest crap I've ever seen. My son told me to turn it off after 2 minutes of viewing it and he's only 2.5 yrs old. It is poor in quality in addition to it being so lame. DO NOT BUY
4,The Third in the Trilogy,"This album came out a year after the classic ""You're Living All Over Us"" and maybe it was too much to ask to surpass it. That doesn't mean 'Bug' is a bad album, not at all. It makes the Dinosaur JR with Lou trilogy complete.The first song however might be the best of all the early Dinosaur work. ""Freak Scene"" is an indie classic that can rival with Pavement's 'Cut Your Hair' or even 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'Everything is in order again, the sound is still murky but that's part of their sound back then. J's guitar sound is great of course. The sound is a little more varied and fresh, there's even an occassional acoustic guitar in there.Songs like 'Pond' and 'No Bones' remind you of the previous albums and 'Budge' seems to be the ultimate song showing the old but also the new Dinosaur that would later record 'Green Mind'.Like YLAOM this album is like wine, it gets better over time and even though it might not get a Hall of Fame status, it's still really good."
1,Pure Fiction.,"The title says it all.It is pure fiction, and anyone who believes that this book is anything other than pure fiction is delusional."
2,Did'nt like it,"I like devin the dude,but i wasnt feeling this album.The beats are bland.The lyrics are hilarious though.If you like sex filled weed smoking rhymes this albums for you."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with the book. While the subject of Maya's donation was slightly covered, the author spent the majority of the book describing her various problems with relationships from her family of origin through her various husbands and boyfriends and the guilt she felt in her parenting of both Maya and Maya's younger half-sister. Her treatment of donation was sparse at best, focusing more on her own less-than-comfortable relationship with one of the recipients and her various speaking engagements. As the parent of a child who was also, at the age of 17 a donor, I found myself saddened that more attention wasn't paid to Maya's story and legacy and less to the writer's need to describe her conversations with her therapist. A wonderful opportunity to educate and encourage others about the gifts of donation - for both donor families and donor recipients - was missed."
5,Psychological journey,"I picked up this book because the picture on the cover looks like my own daughter. When I read the back notes and learned that she was dead, I quickly put it back down. I didn't want to read about Eleanor Vincent's devastating loss. For some reason, though, I felt compelled to try to comprehend her experience.What I found was indeed distressing, but inspirational at the same time. The book is in many ways a postmortem tribute to Vincent's daughter and an exploration of the healing effects of organ donation. Taken in its entirety, however, this book is really about a journey through the process of healing from a lifetime of psychological traumas. The extreme grief over her daughter's sudden death and the struggle to cope with it lead Vincent down buried paths of pain going all the way back to her childhood. She emerges transformed. She lost her daughter, but therein found herself, and we can't help but applaud her success."
4,Maya was my Cousin,"My Aunt Ellie sent me a copy of the book when it was finished, that was April of 2004. I finally finished just yesterday July 12th,2005. I never anticipated that it would describe in detail the harrowing wait in that hospital for those 4 days that we all endured. I had to put the book down for the year to regain the strength to read on.Being extremely close with Maya and having her be a huge part of my childhood, I thought there would be more about Maya's life as part of ""Dan's"" family. ""Dan"" is my Uncle, Maya's step-father and Maya was as connected to us as an actual blood relative of our family.Although this is much more of a biography rather then letting people really grasp who Maya was, it is a good book."
2,Unlistenable history,"This particular recording gets a piddly two stars, although the Huskers will forever remain one of my favorite bands of all-time. The title of the disc is very appropriate, as the 17 songs zip by in something like 25 minutes. Problem is, you'll have to take the jacket's word for it, because 1) you can't tell when one song ends and another begins, and 2) the CD is only broken into two halves instead of 17 separate tracks.In short, this isn't the place to start your education about Husker Du. It's more of a collectible for fans or a novelty for anyone else. There are probably some great songs here, but if you can hear anything but a jumbled mass of noise, I want your ears. Fast? Yes. Intense? Yes. Musical? It's a stretch. ""The Living End,"" the boys' finale, is an infinitely better example of what this band's live show was about."
2,Essential Recording?,"Well, maybe it's essential if you want to complete your Husker Du collection. In that case, I'd recommend buying it last. But, if you're new to this band, there are much better places to start. The performances are energetic but sloppy and the end result is a record that sounds like what most hardcore bands were doing at the time. That is to say, stupidly fast song tempos, lack of melody and structure, and ""angry young man"" shouting. Top it all off with bad bootleg-quality sound and you have ""Land Speed Record"".For a great live H.D. album, check out ""The Living End"", which was recorded on the ""Warehouse"" tour (regretably, their last). The boys had thankfully abandoned hardcore by then, but there's no shortage of passion, energy and volume, either."
1,unlistable generic angstcore,"this is not worth owning. i love husker du, bob mould, grant hart, sugar, etc., but this is just no fun. as an aesthetic go for broke, speed-ridden mass of noise, its great. otherwise, if you care about anything else about music (ie melody, lyrics, harmony, production) go elsewhere. great cover though, and data control IS a good song."
1,a mess,"Husker du are legend. Zen Arcade, New Day Rising and Candy Apple Grey are classics. What we have here in Land Speed record is a mess. Aside from the very excellent cover this LP has few redeeming qualities other than a document of the beginnings of one of the greatest rock bands of the 80's. Buy for curiositys sake only, otherwise pick up Zen Arcade metal Circus or any other Husker Du release for that matter."
1,I hate this album with all my heart,"I love husker du.... this album is not. The guitar isdrowded out, bob's screams suck and out of sync, singingsucks, sound quality sucks. The music isn't discernable.Its really sloppy,even for husker du. What is up the two track thing? OK unique, but still... you either have to wait or forward till you think is the next song. For a better mini album, go to metal circus. and this album:26 minutes, not good. (...). Not enjoyable."
2,"brilliant band, but a poor showing","Husker Du was a great band, one of my favorite rock bands of all time, but Land Speed Record is nearly incoherent. Even the band's energy is lost, totally wasted, due to the overall sound of this record. L.S.R. sounds like the band playing in doubletime, aboard the deck of a sinking ship.Husker Du's songwriting got better, and their playing got better, AFTER this record was released. There's nothing much to recommend this, except the fact that it was released by Husker Du.Fans might argue that their mightiest, fastest, and most energetic release was Land Speed Record.I would say that Land Speed Record was the record that Husker Du released just before they learned how to write a good song.For Husker Du completists only."
5,Refreshingly non-sterile,"I guess for youngsters who only grew up with sterile, wanna-be punk or ""hard"" music, this is difficult to get.Sloppy? Of course its sloppy, it's punk! Not that punk has to be sloppy, but if it is, who cares? You can go and buy the latest Green Day or other Kindergarten bands CDs, if you prefer..I love it!"
2,For serious fans only,"A series of lightning-fast hardcore punk tunes recorded live with mediocre sound quality. The songs have not aged well, especially political numbers like ""MIC"". If you want an introduction to the early punk-based sound of Husker Du, check out ""Everything Falls Apart and More"" before buying this one. You have to really love the band to get anything out of this record.The CD mastering is also strange. Rather than assign a separate track for each song, the CD has just two tracks that correspond to sides 1 and 2 of the original vinyl release. Yet another high-quality SST Records product."
3,delivered,"i ordered this record to be sent to me so i could play it, i got it, played it and it's all good"
2,marginally acceptable but nothing special at all.,Get The Dark Roads instead! It knocks this one flat on its behind and urinates all over it!
2,A Disappointment,"This book only tells of the hardships related to being a missionary in Ecuador. Very little scripture references or scripture related verses are included in the stories. I just felt that it lacked content and adhesiveness. Something is missing in the structure. The book is not what I thought it would be. Sorry, but I didn't get enough information."
5,Think of a Dvorak Romantic Piece -- Beautifully Tragic!,"This is a wonderfully rich story with characters so authentically portrayed that I still think of them. I wish that this author would write more. Think Dickens & Tolstoy -- it's here. If you like a little sadness sprinkled with lots of great atmosphere & good dialolgue, this is a must read!! There is music, in a minor key, on every page!! It will, most likely, remain to be one of my favorite books. I've only kept a few of my books. Among those kept are: Pat Conroy's works, Nuala O'Faolain's book, Katie Singer's book & this rare jewel!!"
3,An obsure band... that able to make you feel and felt,"Felt is an obscure band lead by Myke Jackson and ""Felt"" is their lone album. Attracted by the cover, I bought this record and found that it was a very pleasant listening experience. the opener ""Look At the Sun"" is a gentle pop song with memorable melody, while ""Now she's gone"" was a song about Drug problem and this blues was played with fire. Weeping Mama' Blues is an acceptable organ-lead blues, which summarize the side-A. Side-B was inferior compare to side A, and the song ""The Change"" sounds boring and the closer ""Destination"" seems cheesy. Afterall, try ""look at the sun"" and ""now she's gone"" and you will find that it's worth to own the album."
2,Capitals only,"Frommer's does a good job with the general hints on travelling cheaper, but unless you plan on visiting only the major cities and capitals only, look for another book. There are 24 major cities and surrounding areas covered from Ireland to Budapest, but that's not many cities in comparison with all of Europe. I only will have a short time in Europe and that means that I will only be able to visit two of the cities listed and have to use another book for everything in between. Lonely Planet is much more inclusive and definitely covers the lower price scale."
5,AFFORDABLE EUROPE AT ITS BEST!,This guide keeps getting better year after year! I used the '97 edition to go to Prague and the '99 edition to go to Madrid and had a great time and saved lots of money. Now I'm planning to see London and Paris and the 2001 edition looks like all I'll need. Even the maps are looking sharper! Well done!
2,Be careful using the advice with this book,I have had mixed results with Frommer's books. I like their maps and guides to attractions... BUT... The hotels they recommend in the lower end category often fall short. I especially did not like their recommendations for Rome.The book has a great layout but the hotels need to be rechecked. I would make sure to balance this book with another guide like Karen Brown's or Fodor's... I make sure any hotel I stay in has a good rating in at least two sources....
5,Can anyone give a good reason why this show wasn't a success,"In the time of ... a slew of the most pathetic television shows ever made, it's really no surprise that this show was not a success. But, in a normal world that enjoys good quality entertainment, and off-the wall hilarity, this would be the top show. Unfortunately we don't live in the kind of world with respectable television shows. We live in the age of heartless exploitations of people in what we call reality TV shows.Clerks is funny, there is no doubt about it. This DVD is probably one of my most prized posessions. Even though alot of the ideas are not original ... it is still 3 hours of non-stop laughter..."
2,"Has its moments, but not really a good idea",The episode comparing the movie to the cartoon really sums this up for me. They're entirely different.Kevin Smith and his crew would have been much better off coming up with an original concept if they wanted to do a network cartoon. Whenever the cartoon tried to act like the movie it seemed forced and didn't work with censored language. Whenever it got too far away from the movie you began to question why they made the movie into a cartoon in the first place. It really was a no win situation.Then adding an evil billionaire character just made the Simpsons comparisons way too easy.
3,"3 stars for the dvd, 5 stars for the content...","Hey, email me if you have the same problems that I do. I loved this dvd. I too missed the two episodes when they first aired on abc. I have one major problem with the package though. Each disc skips, loops and glitches A LOT in my player. I have not been able to try it in any other players, but it is very annoying, especially since it is stretched out over two discs and both discs do it. I have actually been through 2 copies so far (taking back the second today), and hopefully will find one that doesn't have this problem.The content is great however, and I recommend this to anyone who can play it without the glitches.""Who is driving? Ohmygodbearisdrivinghowcanthatbe???"""
5,Awsome!!!,"this show is on comedy central @ 12:00 am on Sundays,if your willing to stay up that late.... than watch it. Its awsome. If you liked the kevin smith movies (clerks:the black and white movie, mallrats, chasing Amy, dogma, or Jay And Silent Bob Strike back) than you will like this too. If you havent seen it trust me its good, pick up this DVD today. the best episode is the discreto buritos 1, if youve seen it youll know wut im talkin bout."
2,I'm a Kevin Smith fan but,"Ok, when Smith asserted that the Mousehouse had unduly used their influence again (first time being on Dogma) I was willing to believe him. Only 2 shows were shown, out of order and boom, it was gone.Trust me when I say they deserved to go. While I like his movies and comics, the cartoons just weren't, well, there. Very referential, repetitive and with only a good joke or two per episode (which is generally about a joke or two more than most tv shows) I just didn't like it."
3,Hmmm maybe not for network TV,Well what to say this was by far the worst I have seen from Kevin it just didnt have the feel fo clerks a bit of a let down some good parts worth seeing once but not much more a shame it was a great idea just didnt come together very well every thing tat makes Clerks what it is was to much for TV what a shame
4,"A show that had wings, but no wind to help it.","This show is by far one of the best animated ones I've seen. It was original, had cool animation, and writing by none other than Kevin Smith.Don't expect to watch a sequel to the Clerks movie. There is no swearing, even though they tried to slip a sex joke here and there. But the core of the original film is there. The characters, the quick dialogue and, of course, the laughs.I just watched the entire DVD and I must say that it makes you mad to think that you could be watching this show every week, but can't because ABC canceled it. I hope Smith thinks about maybe taking this project to HBO or Showtime so he can REALLY do what he wants.I recomend this to any hard core Kevin Smith Fan."
4,NOT THE MOVIE,"If you can get past the fact that THIS IS NOT CLERKS THE MOVIE (hinted at by the fact that it's in colour and animated...) then you'll see that there's actually some pretty good stuff in here, such as the kid with the helmet, ""the matrix"", the apocolyptic carnival, the japanamation style ending to one of the episodes... it's network television people; they can't swear, they can't have sex with dead people in the bathroom... it's not the movie. Get over it, and enjoy one of the funniest cartoons ever drawn before a live studio audience."
5,BRILLIANT,"It is softer in tone, language, and overall meaning than the movie, but these shows are still hysterical. It is a shame the series didn't hit, cause there are some really great moments on it. But, as with all View Askew discs, the commentary makes it essential. GET THIS!"
4,Good part of your Jay and Silent Bob collection,"I have to say that this dvd is a great item to own. I really love the characters of this show because it it a very unusual bunch.Here you got Dante and Randal, two guys who work in a convenient store, one a nice and hardworking guy, and one slacker/moron.Then on the other hand you have Jay and Silent Bob,sorta like Dante and Randal, except on pot, one a moron, the other a nice but quiet guy.There is only two things I have a problem with this dvd.1. The creators made Randal to stupid and whacky. In the movie he is a very slackish and jerkish character. But it is still incredibly funny so I have no problem with it.2. On the commentary they made a awful comment on one of my other favorite shows ""Family Guy"".The creators had NO right making fun of it.But still this a very good dvd to own and I reccomend it to anyone."
5,very good,"Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier brings Jayson Mewes, Jeff Anderson, and Brian O'Halloran back to life as Jay, Randall and Dante in a cartoon. It is extreamly funny, if you already are a fan of Kevin Smith's work: Clerks, Mallrats, Charsing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Slient Bob Strike Back, some of them already considered classics (Clerks and Chasing Amy)... and some of them considered collosal bombs (Mallrats).If you don't already know Smith's other work you may just consider it all some kind of weird Simpsons rip-off. It is that, of course, but it is also a lot more than that. A better comparison might be to the campy Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV Show... Sometimes it looks stupid, but then, that is the point to a large extent. If you get and like Buffy, then you will probably like and get Clerks the Cartoon, as well as the rest of Smiths work."
3,"Funny show, good features, bad commentary","The series is funny, too bad it's only 6 episodes. There are some features like viewing storyboard sketches, commercials, the Making of... All the main characters were the same people from the movie, and there are some cool celebrities. A LOT of tasteless gay jokes, though.The commentary is just very bad. If it was better, it would get four stars. Kevin Smith and cast are all there, at least, and say some interestingly funny things, but they keep ranting on about how the show got cancelled. Did they mention it only was showed twice? Oh, and you know ABC cancelled it, right? it gets monotonous after a while. There's some behind the scenes talk, about how they had to censor things and come up with jokes, but the rest you can do without.Jay and Silent Bob introduce each new episode, and are great. You don't really need to spend extra for the DVD, the VHS may be just fine, and just as funny."
3,"Kevin Smith on a Disney network? No, thanks.","I love Kevin Smith. I love all of his films. Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Jersey Girl, Clerks II. Zack and Miri, Cop Out, Red State, SModcast, EVERYTHING!! I love Kevin. But I don't love Clerks: the cartoon. You're gonna taje a dude whom makes a living by telling d*ck and sex jokes and you're gonna put that dude on the Disney owned ABC? No, thanks. I'll pass. This show is not awesome. Kevin does have the freedom he should with this. If this had been on HBO, Adult Swim, or even CBS or that matter maybe it'd have done more than two episodes. If you like Kevin Smith, buy this. If you're iffy on his films, stay away. I only bought this to add it to my Kevin Smith collection and because of the 'Jay and Silent Bob Super Groovy Cartoon Movie' coming out next year."
3,A must buy for all Clerks amd Jay and Silent Bob fans!,"This cartoon is pretty funny, it captures the flavor of the movie, with many Star Wars references, including Episode I, cameos buy none other than George Lucas, Steven Speilburg, Oliver Stone, (not their real voices), and the commentary is pretty good. They talk about why the show got cancelled after 2 episodes. A good investment as you get to see all six that were made."
4,Worth it.,"If you are a fan of Kevin Smith's older works, this is a must have. While the series was short lived, it's a great addition and followup to the movies."
5,"Clerks, just in cartoon form...","If you liked the Clerks movies, then you'll like this. Just six episodes, but all are great. The second episode (on the DVDs) can get a little repetitive, but only for me after a few watches. Directed, I believe, by Kevin Smith (Silent Bob), you know these episodes will be classic Clerks."
2,Not Kevin's Best Work,"On my list of top 20 movies of all time, at least 4 of them are Kevin Smith's. I *LOVE* his work. That said, I found the Clerks animated series to be boring. The stories were slow and repetitive. The jokes were sophmoric and tedious compared to his usually intelligent humor. I just couldn't get into it. I know what you're thinking, ""Jay and Silent Bob? Intelligent humor?!"" Ok, so maybe intelligent isn't the word, but it's humor for intelligent people. Compare and contrast with, for example, Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler. Still often VERY funny, but it doesn't take a much wit to get the jokes. This disk was more like that kind of humor."
2,Not Even Funny as expected! Uncensored??,"I was very disappointed! I thought beacuse the cartoon video was uncensored, it would have foul language like the original movie.This animated video has 5 or 6 episodes. The dialog chosen was most of the time [bad]. I really expected a lot more! Could have been great if a script closer to the movie materialized.The only thing I found funny was when the Kevin and Silent Bob guys talked in between and used F words and this was the funny part. Don't expect this to be like the movie. However, if you are a diehard fan, get this video anyway."
1,What's uncensored about it?,"I first heard about this animated adventure on viewaskew.com. I must say that I never saw the original broadcast of the first 2 episodes, but when I heard a complete collection was going to be released (I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan), I just had to get it. My expectations must have been set too high because it was just plain awful. Laughs were far and few between. The best parts of the whole DVD were the Character Development and The Clerks Style Featurettes, but hardly worth the money paid. The 15 second introductions before each each episode were the only ""uncensored"" portions of the video. I had expected a little more off-the-wall, cutting-edge humor instead of 6th grade antics. Save your money and buy something worthy of being in your collection."
5,Hysteria,"Clerks Animated Series Uncensored was the best show on TV that nobody was watching. It was the type of show that made you laugh at yourself for laughing. Classic, in every sense of the word. The only problems I've had was running the dvd on my mitsubishi player. I had to watch it on my friend's player. Has anyone else had a similiar problem?"
5,A Future Classic,"This album even though not as well received as other albums by this group is a diamond in the rough. It is jazzy B and co.'s musical maturity at its peak. This album is a must for collectors of future classics, because the 12th track on this album is destined for that honour, look out for samples of this track in the future. Even if it is for track 12 alone, this is a must buy, it is better than past and later outings by this group even though unfortunately underestimated."
4,A fair selection / Seleccion justa,"The films included in this First Volume are / Las peliculas incluidas en este Primer Volumen son:* El miedo no anda en burro* Tonta tonta pero no tanto* La presidenta municipal* Okey mister PanchoNo subtitles, no special features / Sin subtitulos ni material extra."
4,Great upgrade,"I purchased these for an upgrade for the rear of my z28 all I can is it was better than the stock but, I guess they were tired ride is better not rough at all."
1,LogiCrap indeed,"So since some people need a little more clarification...I liked these headphones. I felt the sound quality is good enough, since i'm no audiophile. The loops that go over your ear are a bit annoying however.Though today, I slightly pulled apart the headphones to fit on my ears. I did not put over my head. And they snapped right in half. Looking at the plastic, it is stressed with cracks all along the plastic part, and i'm surprised they even lasted the 3 months I had these. Don't bother purchasing these headphones."
3,Around the back of your neck!,"This is a simple response to the reviewer Justin C. Samsel, whom stated the following; ""Purchased this hi-tech, alien looking headphones not two months ago and the headphones have already snapped from stress midway across the thingee that goes over your head.""The ""thingee"" part of these headphones are designed to go ""around the back of your neck""!No wonder they snapped in half after forcing them over your head!"
4,Fine For the Price,"I've had the clear version for about 6 months now and use them occasionally with my computer to listen to music or play games. The quality is fine - they haven't broken yet nor has the foam fallen off. They clip fairly easily to the ears and I've found them to be comfortable for long term use (4+ hours using them, for example).One drawback for me is that they do have a very short cord (likely due to them being meant for portable devices). The cord also doesn't coil or roll up so it can get in the way often.For the price, they have done what I've asked and the quality is fine. They do surprisingly cut out a lot of background noise despite not being a very close fit to the ear."
4,Fragile but I love them,"I have had two pair of these, and I am hoping to get several more (currently looking)...each pair lasted me about 1 year. I got them for only $5 each, so at that price they are well worth it to me, but I probably wouldn't pay much more due to the fact they do break. My last pair just broke today. I use them at work almost daily, so I am not surprised they only lasted about a year each. The plastic in the back is very fragile and has many stress fractures in it, but the sound quality is excellent. The sound is crisp and clear with not too much bass. I work at an architecture firm and have gotten many compliments on the style. I would highly recommend for the sound quality, but not for reliability. If you can find them for cheap (around $5) buy like 6 and just replace them when they break. The sound quality and style make it worth it."
2,Logicrap (in my opinion),"Purchased this hi-tech, alien looking headphones not two months ago and the headphones have already snapped from stress midway across the thingee that goes over your head.Sound reproduction was good for what consumers pay. Weak or totally absent low and high end frequencies, but decent enough to enjoy for casual listening. Cord was ridiculously short (about 3') for most places of use so I had to buy an extension. The quality is comparable to most other Logicrap computer peripherals. I would not recommend this purchase."
4,Marvelous Misbehavings,Firey and often first-rate stories. A gorgeous book with some stunning writing throughout. They're what's great about being bad.
3,Not bad,"This book is not what I thought it was going to be. However, I enjoyed the stories presented in it. I accidently ordered two, so I am giving one as a Christmas gift to a friend, if you are a reader you will enjoy it."
3,Fun for a 1 year old (not much else) (Helpful Reviewer,"I will state that the price is a little bogus. To pay over 10 dollars for this item (I did) is ridiculous. I just want to give you fare warning so you can find it cheaper if you can.Would I buy it for a 6 year old? No do not buy it for anything above 2. You might be able to get away with 3 but the fun value runs out really quick around that age. As my son was 1 he loved to play with and watch the beads fall down. This is nice and they shook it a lot and the toy is very durable.After this though the fun value wains and that is why I could not justify spending much more on it. It is very small and I forked over the extra money for the one that was larger.would I recommend this? I could see as giving it as a birthday gift or something, but I would not want to spend more than 10 dollars for it.For the right price I would buy it. Below 10 dollars if you didn't catch that in my previous comments :)"
4,Decent 4 the price,"I purchased this for my 4 year old sister with Down Syndrome for Christmas. Overall it is a decent rainmaker but she really doesn't seem to be interested. My 1 year old daughter likes it a bit more than her 8"" one I bought for her. The quality seems to be pretty sturdy but again we've only had it for 4 days. My suggestion would be to but a real one made of wood if you're going for the sound, if you're going for looks this is pretty for a baby."
3,It big for a 1 year old,My friend had a smaller one of these and my daughter was fascinated. So I ran home to order one for Christmas. It is a great toy but to heavy and long for a one year old. She hit herself in the head several times and was not able to play with it as effectively as she could the smaller one.
4,I thought my kids would love it but I love it more,I bough this for my 3 year old and 1 year old daughters. I play with it more than they do. It's cool but it's pricey in my opinion.
3,just ok,"the toy was just ok, for the price we are sure our grandson who is one will like it. it looks cheap , next time would look for one with the metal balls inside."
4,Two year old likes it,"Rainsticks are fun and fascinating. The advantage of this one is that you can see all the little beads as they drop down. Mesmerizing for some kids, not so much for others. It does sound more like plastic beads and less like an actual rainstick, but that might be because you can see the beads, whereas most opaque rainsticks leave you guessing as to what's inside. Bottom line: it wasn't the hit of the party, but it will be played with after my toddler's outgrown the more flashy, age-specific toys."
3,Rainmaker beads get stuck,"We go to Gymboree with our 6 month old and we love their rainmakers. This is the same company that makes the ones for Gymboree. Unfortunately, these don't measure up. Our son still loves this rainmaker as it still calms and interests him...but the beads get stuck. They don't pour down as easily as the ones I've seen...so you end up shaking it like a rattle to get the beads to come down.I looked at the Gymboree sticks made by the same company and the beads they use are more of a transparent bead while the beads in these sticks are more plastic composite looking.We still use this rainmaker...but I don't know why Hohner stopped using the old type of beads."
5,Daughter likes it.,Item arrived as pictured. No damage or problems. Bought this for my 18-mo. old and she does like it and play with it.
4,nice!,"this is actually a pretty cool, fairly quiet toy for a toddler! the falling beads keep her as interested as the soothing sound."
4,For 1 and under,"I think this is a neat toy but I think it is more interesting for younger kids. I bought this for my 18 month old to play with in the car but it doesn't hold her attention. I also would have preferred the smaller size, I did not realize despite the description just how big this one was. It really does sound like rain though and she does play with it but mostly in passing. I'll keep it around for the next little one."
2,Online game play doesn't work,"Beware! The CD key in the jewel case is common all through! You will not be able to play this game online...barring that, a wonderful game! Love it!"
5,A must have!,Formated from A to Z. Bunches of info on places and times that touched the life of James Dean. I followed up on many places I didn't know about on Google Maps. Full of facts new to me and I've been a James Dean fan since 1955. I love this book. Great source of information. Its a James Dean encyciopedia! All around great reference book!
1,Top Dollar for paper back TRASH.,"It took two so called writers to come up with this mind numbing garbage. I've never read anything so insulting to a readers intelligence and I'm a librarian. This is an encyclopedia of stupid trivia. Try this Dean is alive in Mexico and women make love to his ghost.Talk about make a quick buck.If the were any justice these two would be behind bars, if only I were rich I'd pay them never to write another word. As for poor long dead Dean let him R.I.P and spare him from these Pathetic Moronic Weirdo so called fans.Hear this if Dean were still alive he'd be fat bald and nearly 80. Get a life and get an honest job."
3,great content pure design,"Great content - 5 starsThe purest art book design I've ever seen - 2 starsThe decision to use this book format (9""x6"") was a disaster.It ruined the book completely. Because of the small format theillustrations became smaller and the book became thicker. Henceit's difficult to hold and impossible to open wide.This book cries for the coffee table book format.Hopefully the publisher will make the second edition in alarger format, something similar to this book:Egon Schiele: Self-portraits and Portraits"
5,Splendid art,"Egon Schiele is not well known and died way too young, but his work is magnificent. The book is well bound and filled with reproductions of his sketches and watercolors. His skill is natural, uninhibited and startling in many if its examples. The book presents his work and his life very skillfully."
5,an expansive and critical retrospective,"The author did a lovely job of providing the mental and historical setting under which the drawings and paintings where done. They are very high quality glossy prints and on nice thick paper. Very sturdy, thick book. It appears as though it will be able to stand years of abuse.It indefinitely changed my view on him. I now look at him as one would the screw up little brother who thinks everything should be handed to him but has one or two endearing qualities which make you still love him. Oh, Egon!"
5,"Accesible but still ""edgy""...","My favorite Henry Kaiser work. Of course, you never know what to expect from Mr. Kaiser's large body of available material, one minute playing ethnic instruments alongside David Lindley, one minute deep in some avant work, and so on. Here he unites Bobbie Gentry, Andy Griffith (""Fishing Hole"" is the theme song from Andy's TV show), and the Grateful Dead into a work that is non-thematic to say the least. Each song gets its own fair treatment within basically its own original motif, albeit flavored uniquely by Henry. Nice warm female vocals are a great touch."
2,really garish,"Should have thought twice about this one -- it's really big and a very garish green. Not worth sending back, so I guess it will go to a yard sale..."
1,It's Not Green,"The first time I used the vase the green color started coming off. The vase is very, very heavy thick glass."
1,BORING!,"Unless you are an avid WWF/WWE video/dvd collector like myself then skip this stink fest of a pay per view. I bought it to complete my entire WWE ppv collection. If you are not a serious collector, and are more just curious about this event, take my advice and skip it! If you want a fun WWF pay per view try Mayhem in Manchester."
2,"WWF InsurreXtion 2001 - VERY poor UK event, don't watch it!!","WWF/E InsurreXtion 2001 has got to be the worst WWF/E United Kingdom PPV of ALL TIME. Only 1 Championship match and the whole card is a mess.And of course, the title DOES NOT change hands -- what can you expect from a WWF/E Pay-per-View in the UK??? The WWF/E Title NEVER changes hands...All in all this is the worst UK event. Get Rebellion 2000 if you want a *REALLY GOOD* UK PPV."
4,The Insurrextion Review,"As Insurrextion whent on the air Commisioner Regal annnouonced the card was changed, so the main event would now be a handicaped match for the World Wrestling Federation Championship featuring; The Undertaker vs Trilple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The undercard was OK, but nothing special like the UK undercards are, So on to the main event. Most of the match,The Undertaker was in control, but in the end he pinned Triple H, so Stone Cold Steve Austin kept his WWF Title. Overall WWF Insurrextion was a pretty good event, and I would recomend buying it."
4,"Yes, they let their hair down but it is still a great record","This record came off the heels of the very competent and keyboard heavy Real Life. Mel Gaynor had departed the trio and session musicians filled the void. Just listen to the guitar work and keyboards on this album......perfect. Both handled almost exclusively by Charlie Burchill who I conisder to be THE most underrated musician alive. I look for musicians who play their part, no overbearing solos to spotlight themselves, just play to complete the song. This record rocks. The vocals are spot on, the rythym is great although different from what most veteran Minds fans are used to. This cd is one I insist on having within reach at all times and I recommend it for all those who like thoughtful rock."
5,Thundering,"Powerful, moving, a return to the emotional days of the early 80's. Kerr is omnipotent on lead vocals"
4,Simple Minds' Most Rockin' Album,"I recall there was a five-year wait for this album. It's their hardest-rocking, guitar-centered album up to that point. The only other Simple Minds albums that compare to it are their two most recent, ""Black & White 050505"" from 2005, (never released in the US), and their excellent brand new ""Graffiti Soul"", (2009)."
3,The singles are worth finding,"First off, this is very competent and well-produced music with solid melodies. And, it's also the worst kind of bloated big-sound corporate rock. They should have gone ahead and added a bunch of horns, why not? It sounds like they have three or four sets of female backup singers in places.Well, sorry, it's past and certainly it's better than 99% of the rest of the junk that passes for popular music then or now, but if you can, seek out the singles someplace. ""E55"", ""Celtic Strings"" and ""Women and Ghosts"" are better than anything on the album."
4,One Of Their Best Recordings,"Simple Minds Rock! This CD is an excellent demonstration that these guys can rock. Because of lack of airplay, I did not purchase it until six months after its release date. I happened upon it in a favorite CD store. The first track ""She's A River"" rocks steady and soulfully moreso than classic Simple Minds tunes like ""Sanctify Yourself"" and ""Stand By Love"". After that, tune the well penned music continues with ""Night Music"" then that's followed by a rock steady low beats per minute groove called ""Hypnotised"" which features a great guitar riff.The next three songs are lame then a power groove starts off with an electronic gurgle akin to The Fixx's ""Deeper & Deeper"". The song ""My Life"" is the bread of rock and ""Criminal World"" is a fluff of a wierd dirge followed by a good penned tune to conclude the set entitled ""This Time"". This ranks high among Simple Minds best recordings."
4,Touching--Genius Grey Gardens,A gem. I wish it were longer; but it did a great job with the footage it had. We just came back from a visit to Steepletop and enjoyed the DVD greatly. I highly recommend it. I would love to see something like this done about her Greenwich Village years.
5,edna,"my niece lives this writer, and really enjoys anything substantial she can learn about her. she really liked it."
3,"Wide breadth, too little depth","I had great hopes for this book as I usually enjoy these looks at a number of different types of sites, but the focus was so broad that there was just not detail for each site to truly bring them into focus. Frequently the descripion of the historical period overshadowed the archaeology. Also many of the individual artilces ended in such leading sentences that I was surprised to find a new article on the next page.My final complaint is that use of pictures did not seem to relate well to the text. Objects were mentioned in the text as either the most famous or else were described as being the most typical style, but then were not included with the photos. The opposite was true with pictured objects that were not reflected in the text.That said, it covered and grouped the sites in ways I had not seen before and was not a truly bad book, just not a truly great one. There are better ones available and I would recommend spending your money on one of them."
4,Decent sound from a tiny speaker,These replaced the factory speakers in the dash of my older GM car. Added some nice upper range brilliance to the sound. Easy enough to switch out.
3,Not Great,"Famous Studios was to Paramount what Looney Tunes was to Warner Brothers and Disney was to...Disney, I guess. The Famous Studios cartoons, however, just weren't very good. The best were from Popeye, and other characters (Little Lulu, Baby Huey) had a few winners, but overall, the studio's output was sub-par. The best cartoons on this disc are Popeye's ""Out to Punch"" and the reasonably engaging bouncing-ball cartoon ""The Mild West."" (""The Mild West"" is one that I fondly remember from my childhood, so I may be biased).Unlike some of the DVDs from the Cartoon Crazys series, this one looks a bit smeary and scratchy, and some of the colours are faded. Like the rest of the Cartoon Crazys DVDs, new sound effects have been added, and they strike me as being a little on the distracting side. Included on the DVD is some interesting information about Famous Studios."
2,Only worth the bouncing ball cartoons,"If it were a collection of the bouncing ball cartoons this would be a GREAT DVD. I give the three bouncing ball cartoons on this DVD 5 stars, except for the fact that you have to sit through the song. The sound on this DVD is horrid. It is a FEEL THE SOUND DVD which actually means, LET'S RUIN THE ORIGINAL SOUND BY ADDING RIDICULOUS SOUND EFFECTS. Buy for the bouncing ball movies ONLY."
1,Defective,The DVD was defective.....it skipped throughout the film and the audio was off...The DVD cannot be used and the place I bought it will not contact me after I told them about it...they are just ignoring me....
4,"Good, But Not the Best","PROS:First let me start by saying I like this book. It is easy to read. It is filled with colorful and easy to read charts. It is divided by seasons and months. It shows some of the best items for each month. This is a good starter book.CONS:It has only 60 objects, while my favorite small scope books highlight 100. It could take the beginner a little deeper into the hobby.RECOMMENDATION:Go ahead and choose this book if you like it. You won't go wrong, but there are two other beginners books I would choose before this one. They are:1) Turn Left at Orion (This is not only my first choice, it is the first choice of the majority of astronomers of most of the clubs and forums I have been a part of.)2) Binocular Highlights (Although this book shows 100 binocular objects, binocular objects are also excellent small scope starter objects.)"
2,Hommage to Krzysztof Kieslowski,"Because of the K.K. relationship I went to a fair amount of trouble to obtain this (my copy is Region 2, PAL, whereas I am Region 1, NTSC). The story-line seemed to have great possibilities, and it would indeed have been wonderful to see what K.K. would have done with it. But try as he did, Danis Tanovic's rendition leaves a lot to be desired. One of the most bizarre elements in the film is the hair on Carole Bouquet. Part that really brought a smile to my old face: the old lady shuffling up to the waste disposal to put a bottle in (K.K. lovers will understand). Wish I could recommend, but no.Where was Piaf when we needed her?"
5,"super small, music only, no bells or whistles, I love it.","I got one of these as a replacement to an older Creative Zen. This player is less than half the size of my older 20 gig Zen 2.0. You can not beat the size; the player disappears in a pocket. I have not had any of the issues the previous reviewer had with play-lists. You do need to upgrade the firmware, and while there are some quirks in the software, file transfer and management are a snap. The manual for the player is a PDF file loaded onto the hard drive. There is nothing wrong with this player that can't be fixed in future firmware updates, the 2 updates released by Archos so far have already improved the player significantly. You get a 20 gig player in the size of most 4 or 5 gig players, and at a lower price. What more do you need?"
3,Not an MP3 RECORDER,"Despite the title, if you go to Archos website you'll find that this device is NOT a RECORDER. The Gmini 120 and Gmini 220 models are MP3 recorders."
3,Almost got it but...,"This is just about the perfect mp3 player - small, cool, and definitely something to show to the iPod crowd, BUT: This baby does not work with copy-protected content. From the Archos FAQ page for the XS200:Q: My player won't play my wma files, a message comes up saying ""xxxxxxxxx file is not supported"", what am i doing wrong?A: It is normal because this device does not read Copy Protected Content. Just look at http://www.archos.com/support/faq/faq_GminiXS200.html#category_3This means you cannot use a subscription service like Yahoo! or Napster. No go for me... Dude, I am getting a Dell (DJ)."
4,Great Product at a Great Price,"This little gizmo is great because it's really just a hard drive with headphones and it pretty small. The thing is built solid as a rock and is small enough to make life happy. Mine has been dropped a lot with no defects, just a tiny dent on the back.When it first came out, size for gigs was a huge selling point. It was special because it was 20GB wrapped in 2' x 3' of metallic goodness with an internal battery. I've never tried the jpeg viewing, but the audio/file browser system is nice and easy with the joy of drag-n-drop. The village idiot could use this thing.The only downside is that there's no USB charging. Ah well."
1,NEVER BUY AN ARCHOS PRODUCT!,"I had problems as soon as I opened the box. The player keeps freezing during play, data becomes corrupt, the sound is of poor quality, I tried to have it serviced just 2 months into a 1 year ""warranty"" and they said it was going to cost me $150.00 to repair. If you purchase this product, you will be sorry! It malfunctioned early enough to cancel the charges on my credit card!"
5,excellent performance and size,"i wanted a reliable mp3 player----no calendar, alarm clock, or other unecessary items. the gmini performs great, has no clunky software packages, and sounds great through my home or car stereo. music transfers are very fast and organizing music in folders or playlists is a snap. there is no downside as far as i can tell, especially given the price."
5,The best Mp3 out there,All week i have been looking for the prefect mp3 player and when i say this 20gb that was so tiny with great sound i thought is was the best mp3 out there.The buttons are easy to use.It is easy to get songs on my computer.And other then that this very tiny mp3 in my opion is the best on out there.If you are looking to get a mp3 i would definitely recommend this one.
2,Difficult To Finish,"I wanted to enjoy this collection of short, creepy stories; however, I just couldn't work up much interest in any of them. After finishing each one, there was a feeling of, ""Well? Is that all?"" They were very unsatisfying. I ended up deleting this book from my Kindle because I have no interest in reading it again."
4,A Pure Bl'ast of Sonic Power,"This album comes out of the blocks at full speed and doesn't slow down... a manic ride indeed!In their second LP outing, the boys from Bl'ast take their sound to a new level of intensity. The heavy Black Flag influence is still there, overlaid with a healthy dose of metal riffage. The band wears its influences on its sleeve, but take the sudden tempo shifts, twisted guitar lines and gut wrenching vocals in a direction all their own.If you like your hardcore HARD, and appreciate a band that's tight as can be, you'll dig this. Recommended for fans of the Cro-Mags, early Black Flag, etc. Not for the faint of heart."
1,Wow....,"This was awful. The California hardcore scene was musical disharmony early on, and this album epitomizes it. I couldn't finish listening to it. Power of Expression by this band was okay, but man this CD was awful."
5,"excellent as history, good as literature","I was drawn to this book by the period of time it covered, and because I am very interested in British history. I was further drawn by its historical depth, covering many events that very few Westerners outside of Britain have any knowledge of. I found little bias because it seemed there were two groups of main characters: those who were in support of royal India and those Indians and Angrez (British) who were in support of the Raj.I somewhat agree with the prevailing criticism that the characterisation is a bit thin, but if you are reading this for its historical significance (as I did) as opposed to its literary worth, then it really shouldn't matter very much.Overall, it is very well written book that examines the relationship between the maharajahs of royal India and the British Raj through the eyes of an Indian princess. In the vein of Rutherfurd's ""Sarum"" and ""London,"" but not as broad and long-winded."
4,India and a Princess in Evolution,"This novel reads as a chronicle, not only of Princess Jaya's life, but also of an India in transformation from the late 1800s up through the early years following Independence in 1947.I enjoyed reading this book and found Princess Jaya to be a remarkable woman. She weathers a lot of trying experiences and shows herself to be resilient.The only fault I found with the novel, however, was in the sequencing of historical events. For instance, some of what the author stated about the placing of some events during the First World War were not accurate. When I read a historical novel, I get a better appreciation for the novel when the historical events it describes are true and placed in the proper sequences. Perhaps for some other readers, that matters little. But for me, that took away from me giving this novel 5 stars."
4,A good book to keep yourself engaged for a few days,A very good book for those who want an insight into India's past wrapped in a story. The book has been written in a very easy and flowing style. Often you are transported back in time during the age of the British and the Maharajas of India. Altogether the book is a pleasing experience but often the events in the book leave a bad taste in your mouth.
3,Slow is right!,"I have to agree with those reviewers who said the book is slow moving. In fact, it's so slow that I never finished it! For that reason, my review may be limited in its usefulness, but I thought I would give my thoughts anyway. The main value of the book, as I saw it, is that it gives an insider's perspective on life in India. It's great for getting a feel for the Indian culture and mindset, and the views that Indians have toward the period of British rule.However, after I had read about 7 chapters (50+ pages), it failed to keep my attention. It seemed that the author was just giving more and more background information. The reader is left waiting for some kind of plot or action to begin, but it never does. Maybe if I had read further my patience would have been rewarded; but unfortunately, I don't have that much patience."
4,"Overall good, bit flat","It's very appealing, and if you have any interest in Indian modern history, or the life of an Indian woman, AND you like a long, slow read, then this is a good book. The author covers a great deal of ground in the novel and at times I found descriptions (of utterly fascinating events) rather superficial."
2,"Flat, failed to connect for me","This is basically a fairly dry attempt at an historical epic. I'm familiar with Ms. Mehta's name, and had considered buying Karma Cola once. Here I'd hoped for historical fiction with a little edge to it. Nothing doing. No twists, no edge, no juice to the story at all for me. Even the travelogue-type descriptions withered for me.This has all the trimmings of the engrossing saga, including the lovely cover, but I'm sorry to say it didn't go anywhere for me."
1,Murky and grim encounter with Christmas skyscraper fire.,"I am afraid that this rather murky and smeary print of a most forgettable film does full justice to the original. Materials handled with a certain amount of class in THE TOWERING INFERNO (such as the flashback, the smoke-filled room, the heroic firefighter, etc) here receive short shrift. This is disaster by the book, with little sympathy for the participants, little compassion for the victims, and little effort in the effects.The print from which this DVD is taken seems in dire need of restoration. Focus is foggy, color faded, images darkened, clips and frames missing.And yet, if you are a disaster-film junky such as I am, this film at its modest price will be a suitable addition to your collection."
1,Footage Missing from the Direct Source DVD,"Terror on the 40th FloorDirect Source issued a DVD of this film, which is now out of print. I just purchased it, hoping it would be a better transfer than the one released by Braun Media (which has a video glitch in one scene). However, I found that Direct Source's print is missing about 8 minutes of footage, including the scenes where the party guests first realize their building is on fire. This is not the result of this being a different edit of the film. There is simply a noticeably awkward jump in the film that skips over the scenes. I'd rather have the slight video problems of my Braun Media copy than an incomplete print. I am returning the Direct Source copy."
1,POS,"Had to rewire it to make it work. Lights operated backward ( left was right, right was left ) and the reverse lights activated my brakes. Would have been easier to start from scratch myself. Chinese junk!!!"
5,A River Runs Through It,"""History is something like a river,"" we read in the introduction to this extraordinary book that loops and turns from the mountains all the way to the sea. Weaving myth, history, biology, the stories of salmon, Yurok, Karok, Hupa and immigrant farmers, Stephen Most tells the story of one of California's most beautiful and storied rivers. One feels the sacredness of it. If you love wilderness books and river books and if the land for you wears a beautiful face, don't miss this book. It will take you there."
1,Scratched,I purchased 5 Bulldog Drummond movies. All arrived scratched and unplayable. After polishing the scratches out I was able to play most of them. Extremely disappointed in this product.
3,Not really suprised,"After listening to their first disc since ""Shelter"" in 1997, I'm not really suprised that they underwent a significant change. Although I like their earlier stuff, this was not a bad disc. Songs like ""Paarty"", ""The rhythm is"", and ""Bling,Bling"" did carry my interest quite a bit. I thought it was a wise choice in selecting Sy on most of the vocals. She does have a very talented voice. However I was slighty disappointed with the song that N'Dea did. All and All this a fair cd and I know that there were alot of die hard fans that were totally disappointed in this album. Teh bottomline is that we always be satisfied and sometimes you have to go with the times and can't always stick to the same formula..."
2,not the collection,Very disappointing; I thought this was the entire collection but is it a subset (first three) in the collection. Red Dragon and one other one are missing from the collection. Other than that the movies were good.
3,Hannibal,manhunter brings this down as it is not nearly as well done as the red dragon. red dragon should be in this set.
1,Blu-Ray Review,This is terrible quality. Hannibal is in no way Blu-Ray. The other 2 are so-so. I am returning my purchase because this is garbage. Fox is the worse company when it comes to Blu-Ray.
2,You can't call this Hannibal collection without Red Dragon,"I'm not discussing how great Silence is, everyone knows that. But know this, Fox for some unknown reason gives us a Hannibal collection and leaves out Red Dragon, the wonderful prequel to Silence of the Lambs? It's no silence, but it's very very well done and deserves to be in this collection. Edward Norton was in perfect form along side with Anthony Hopkins. Red Dragon should have never been dissed like this, it should be in this collection. That said, this collection is not worth your money. I'm sure Fox will get enough complaints about it that they will come through some day. But right now, hold on to your dough and wait for a full collection that Anthony Hopkins deserves."
4,Great to see another take,"Seeing ""Manhunter"" was interesting. It is the original Hannibal Lecter movie. It is a great although less spectacular take on the ""Red Dragon"" story, same story, different ending."
4,Great Series Would Rather Had Red Dragon,This is a great series but the collection would have been better if it would have included Red Dragon instead of Manhunter. I purchased this set to replace all of the same movues on DVD.
2,No Red Dragon or Hannibal Rising???,"I though Red Dragon was everybit as good as Manhunter and actaully more faithful to the book. Having a ""Hannibal Collection"" that has two Hannibals in completely unconected films and yet leaves out one Anthony Hopkins film as well as the so-so prequel (be that as it may, Like Superman 3 & 4 and Star Wars I, it's still part of the collection!)And since I've already seen TSOTL for under $20, this isn't even a great price, it's just going rate for older films with little market value. These will all be $15 seperately at best-buy and Target soon enough.I'm happy to see the films hitting blu-ray, but the ""Collection"" is ""Rising"" ""Dragon"" ""lambs"" & ""hannibal"" with ""Man Hunter"" as an extra -- not this. All I would feel if i bought this, is that I was missing two films."
4,The Hannibal Lecter Collection - Manhunter / The Silence of the Lambs / Hannibal,I really enjoyed The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal but was disappointed in Manhunter...
4,Jon's Review,"Good, but i think more people associate the Hannibal Lector trilogy/collection with Red Dragon and not Manhunter or whatever else comes with this package.Manhunter, basically Red Dragon, made in the 1980's is a lesser version of Red Dragon.Good if you're a collector, probably not if you're a movie watcher. Of course, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal are phenominal, Manhunter - not so much."
2,Sadly Lacking...,"I thought I would be upgrading when I bought this blu-ray set, but I was sadly disappointed. Shame on 20th Century fox for putting a bare bones skeleton of a blu-ray set out there for people to spend money on! I much better enjoy the special features and even Easter Eggs on my regular ""old-tech"" DVD. Hannibal was so sadly lacking in extras it was pitiful. Now I'm shy to buy any other version of Hannibal on blu-ray out of wasting my money.If there's an blu-ray edition that has the extras of Hannibal Special Edition out there, please speak up. This edition is earmarked for the buy-back pile.Disappointing...very disappointing..."
3,the great and the missing,"quality on all 3 movies was great, expected special features on SOTL & Hannibal, but Hannibal disc was bare bones with no special features. wound up ordering non blu-ray to get those features."
4,Hannibal Collection,"The first movie (Manhunter) was interesting, but the guy who plays Hannibal today is the best guy for the part. The first guy did not have the flair that Anthony Hopkins did. I am glad they changed him. As far as the last one in the packet, ""Hannibal"" it was fabulous (although I had seen it before, my boyfriend did not see it). Thanks for putting all three movies together, the price was about $40.00 cheaper than getting all three movies. Thanks again.Tinesha aka Nicolette"
3,Manhunter restoration,"I purchased this item in my persistent attempt to acquire a version of Manhunter that completely restored all the edits that had been made over the years. This ain't it. Get the Divimax version; it has them all back where they belong. I have not played the other two disks in this collection, as I already have Silence of the Lambs and have little interest in Hannibal or Hopkins version of him.I find it curious that Manhunter and Blade Runner suffered so much from rampant editing of excellent products."
3,"""It's OK""","I'm giving this ""collection"" just three stars because it's not a true collection of the Hannibal movies. Yes, the movies included in this bundle are all great movies, but why did they not include the other two (Hannibal Rising and Red Dragon) Hannibal movies? Although Manhunter and Red Dragon are both based off the same novel by Thomas Harris, it would have been nice if they were both included in this bundle.As noted by others that have commented on this bundle, the BluRay version of these films lacks extras. One of the reasons why I switched to BluRay is because of the extras. I love watching how the movie came to be... the inspiration, making of, and commentaries. The decision to not include these tidbits is truly a shame. I think I'm going to sell this bundle back and get each film individually so I can have the extras."
5,Great Collection of Movies,"Manhunter, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal all on their own blu-ray disc for around 30-$35.00. I thought it was a great deal. They could of put Red Dragon in the package but it's just a remake of Manhunter but it would still be cool to compare the two movies and I like Edward Norton as an actor."
3,read carefully,manhunter is the only one of the three movies on this disk that is in widescreen format. the other two are in full screen.
3,Shop Carefully,"Be very careful when shopping for and ordering this item. Although a picture of TWO bumpers is shown and most pool ladders have two legs and they wear at the same rate and thus should be replaced at the same time, the offer here is for only ONE bumper (+ shipping). I ordered this because of the low price and then realized it was not a package of 2. The product is as described but they are sold in pairs on ebay (http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=270278168984) for only pennies more than this single one with shipping included. Buyer Beware."
5,Perfect Information for Boondocks Travel or Living!,"I actually owned and read a much earlier version- listened to the advice- set up my 'Traveling Medical Kit'- and really appreciated the clear and concise medical information- and NOW- an updated version- many new ideas interspersed with time-tested procedures and meds- If you spend any time at all in the 'boondocks'-or just travelin'- You need a copy of this book- >and get copies for your kids too-when they get out on their own! This manual is good, practical and will prove itself in the reading of it- and putting into practice it's wisdom- That Dr Forgey- he's something else!!"
3,"I think the book is useful, but not amazing","The book was a bit too basic for my taste. I understand that the layperson doesn't have access to many things that a doctor does. But to me, the book was more about band-aids than it is about stitches. I think it could have been a little meatier.Due to the limited availability of many medicines to the average Joe (or Jane), I suppose the writer couldn't put in a lot of information on how to treat as a doctor would. But I was actually hoping for more of that kind of information."
5,"This book is informative, witty, insightful, and fun!","Marvelous! If you are a social history fan, a Restoration bug, a 17th Century nut, or you just love learning through insightful and witty prose, this is a book you will get lost in. It's not unlike ""What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew""--but more gracefully written, with a fine wry view of the era. Pepys would have loved it! And so would Charles II. Don't delay--it's worth the bucks. Does anyone know anything about author Liza Picard? She's delightful."
4,As a guide to how we londoner's lived our evryday lives,"I enjoyed this dipping in to this book ever morning on my short ride into work, untill one day, when I left it behind on an underground train. Liz Picacd was great at answering those questions that you didn't even know you wanted to ask about life in a large city 350 years ago. Things like 'how did you wash your clothes?', 'were did you go for a good time?' and 'what was the food like?. Altogther a 'must read' for all those interested in the small, but important facts in history, that give us a idea of what eveylife was really like back then."
4,Insightful story in the southern society during Depression,"I just finished Sandra E. Bowen's novel ""This Day's Madness"" and have to say that I enjoyed reading the book very much. The story line was very interesting. I thought I had some understanding of how people lived in the southern states but I never thought that racism was so dominant during the 1930s and 40s. I was surprised myself when I came the first time to the US from Germany (I lived in Louisiana for 3 years) and saw that different ethnic groups still lived so far apart. The ending of the book was quite a surprise to me and I wonder whether the author will continue the story. She can just add new chapters to the book without seeing a break in the novel."
1,Simi-trash,Whenever you see the manufacturer is SIMITAR look no further. This outfit puts out the worst junk imaginable. Their videotapes were all blurry EP speed dubs with overloud sound; their DVDs are little better. Amateur night stuff. feh
1,terrible,"I paid 1 penny for this, and it wasn't worth it. Just someone with a video cam trying to play director. Totally bottom of the barrel."
5,"Informative, and interesting!","Well worth the small amount I paid for it. Well told, and shown...would also be good for classroom showing."
2,Major disappointment,I must admit I bought this book because of the cover....it has a waterfall on the front and it says 'Learn to paint' so I immediately assumed that it would have a demonstration inside on how to paint that waterfall...short story ..it does not.If I bought this book as a 'Learn to paint' and expected it to show me how to paint or improve my painting I would be major disappointed...
4,Kids love it,"I bought this video for my daughter who is autistic, and not only does she love it, so do the children I babysit."
4,GameFace Safety Mask Review,"My daughter is a very small 8 year old who just this year moved out of t-ball and into girls softball. She is not the most coordinated youngster and worries about the ball hitting her, so the safety mask has improved her confidence and ability to take more of a role in the game defensively. I would highly recommend this to any parent of a softball player, especially those who have girls working on being pitchers. Thank you for providing a product that I could not seem to get my hands on locally."
3,My 9 year old doesn't like wearing a mask,Therefore I cannot give a good review. she doesn't like having anything on her face. seems well made. I would recommend.
4,Oh God!,"This is quite possibly the best box set deal of the year! All of the films are great, if you like bad drive-in fare, which i love! The extras really make this worth while! About and hour and a half of trailers, 2 hours of shorts, drive-in intemission spots and comic and poster art with music from the great horror surf band, The Dead Elvi! ... Buy now or be forever sorry! p.s.- the movies offered are 25 dollars each , so yopu are getting 75 dollars worht of moives for like, 40 bucks off, plus the disc of trailers and full color booklets for each film! Awesome, totally awesome!"
3,ocelot in your home,"A glimpse of the past to a time when ocelots were not endangered and often kept as pets. The information is dated and not very realistic in the sense that very few people would actually qualify as a care taker for an ocelot in their home. The book fails to concentrate on the number of cats that were abandoned when the owners realized that ocelots were not very predictable and often remained quite wild. There were, however, certain individuals that took very good care of their cats and developed very strong bonds with them. Today it is next to impossible to purchase an ocelot due to state and federal laws. This book's interest for me was the historical nature of this documentation of a time past."
1,dont buy it!,"It doesnt look anything like the picture. it looks extremely fake, i think i could of have done it better my self!."
2,Picture is very misleading,"While this didn't cost much ($.01 + cheap shipping), the picture is extremely misleading as to what this item is/how it works.Not happy with this, however it's just not worth the time/effort to worry about returning it. Had I known what this actually looked like I would not have purchased it."
1,Wasted Money,"When I bought this, it had almost 50 reviews and 4 stars. The picture looked decent too, so I figured it must be good, however what I received is complete garbage.The actual coloring doesn't look like the picture at all, it has white from the material coming through the paint everywhere and looks nothing like any rock I've ever seen, so it would certainly stand out against others stones in a group. If left outside against the elements, I doubt the paint would hold up more than 1 year.The key compartment has a clever fit, however there is no rubber seal to protect it against rain, dew or bugs.All and all, this was a complete waste of money, and I would have sent it back, but I was in the middle of a busy time at work and forgot about it until after my exchange period had ended. Don't waste your money on this junk."
3,key holder,"It was as advertised, nothing special. but the back did stay on and it looked as advertised and came in the mail very rapidly."
3,Esconderjo para chave de casa,"Por fora este produto é muito bem feito, o que decepciona um pouco é o compartimento para as chaves que poderia ter uma cor mais escura e no se soltar."
3,Rock with key in it was stolen same day,"Unfortunately, my rock was discovered the very same day that I hid it and stolen. I couldn't believe it. I think the sprinkler one might work better. Oh well. c'est la vie."
4,Looks somewhat real,"This looks somewhat real. But if you put it somewhere where people won't be staring at it, then no one will notice the difference"
1,not item pictured,the item pictured is a realistic looking rock. The one i got looks more like something made in a grade school art class. It is however passable if placed somewere not obvious. It would work if no one was looking for it
4,"half a rock, not fully rounded rock",in picture it looks like a rock opened in half and whole in middle.actually it's half a rock standing on a flat side.just FYI.
3,Just OK,"This rock hide a key was ok but not great. When it arrived, the two pieces didn't fit together quite right and the ""rock"" didn't close completely. My husband had to grind down part of the plastic piece that holds the key so the two pieces would fit together tightly. Now it fits fine, however this should have been checked BEFORE shipping it and fixed or not sent at all. It does look pretty good. Another tip: we wrapped our key in a plastic baggie so it wouldn't rust in case moisture did get in."
3,Hide a Key,"Its been a year since I used this. Able to store only 1 key of normal size. Realistic look. I've placed this rock together with other real rocks on my front pouch. You cant tell the differrence just by looking.However if you run your finger across or hold it, its a immediate giveaway. So I suggest you pile upon this some real rocks."
3,Looks Pretty Fake - Get it Dirty!,"I recommend getting this ""rock"" as dirty as possible to help it look more realistic. Rub it in the mud or something. Otherwise it gets the job done."
3,"Looks realistic, but...","If the rock were somehow stuck to the ground and you could never pick it up, it'd be perfect. At first touch, it feels realistic. However...I knocked off two stars for these reasons:A) If you pick it up, even disregarding the plastic bottom, it's too light for a rock.B) The plastic cover that covers the stash must be replaced perfectly, or the white plastic peeks out.Both ruin the appearance of a true rock.The rock also looks out of place on our patio (no other rocks), but that's not the manufacturer's fault. We opted for another item to store our spare keys for our pet sitter. I'm sure that it would be wonderful for other people that have a better place to stash their rock."
3,Imperfect but useful.,"I have to echo many of the same complaints noted in the previous review. The quality of the colour plates was lackluster - a definate step down in terms of Angus McBride's usual work. I was also disappointed with some (though not all) of the B/W photos, in particular those that were scanned from previously published references. This book would have been much more valuable had new photos been taken, preferably from different angles.The text, on the other hand, contained an awful lot of information and insights into Mycenaean warfare that were wholly new to me; in this respect I rate the book quite highly. This is especially important in light of how little information exists on this subject.Overall, I am glad I bought the book, but still find the graphics were a big letdown. If you are interested in this subject, by all means get this book. The information contained herein is very useful indeed. Through Amazon the price is good, as well. Just be prepared for some disappointment."
5,Mycenaean Warriors,"This book tackles a tough topic-contemporaries of the ancient Egyptians, Hittites, and Israelites who left little written evidence of their own history behind. Nonetheless, from a combination of archaeology and pictoral evidence from the Mycenaeans themselves, the author and Angus McBride both paint a convincing picture of these obviously formidable warriors, forefathers of the Greeks."
4,Great Reference Book,"I teach Ancient History and Ancient Literature. I find the book to be of great help in bringing students to an understanding of Mycenaean warfare. I was a bit disappointed in the art depicting the later Mycenaean Age, but all in all, very helpful."
1,Dissappointed,"Based on the price and title, I thought there would be a lot more from this book. Unfortunately, I didn't read the description. If all you want is to know about warfare in this culture in this time, then this is your book. If you thought, like me, that it would be about the culture in a wider range, it's not.You can find probably 20 books with more info on this same material, cheaper, if you keep looking."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Dorothy Yoshida is a telepath, and really a rather good one, at that. A scientist on top of that she is sent to investigate a small planet that appears to be more than what it seems. They suspect it of being artificially altered, but they only life they know about on the surface is not that far advanced from the animal.Mankind hopes to find something to help in the warthey are fighting against aliens.When Dorothy arrives, she finds something very surprising indeed."
4,Charming Little Book,Excellent words of wisdom with nice wood block art prints for illustrations. Good choice of a gift for someone who likes quotations.
4,Better than most 'Cartoon Crazys' titles on DVD,"This collection of cartoons is appropriately included on Cartoon Crazys `Banned & Censored' DVD release - and for good reason too. This is the `type' of release that the Disney Empire would love to be able to release so that it could do justice to the wonderful Song of the South and animated shorts like the banned Fuhrer's Face.Anyone interested in cartoon history or indeed the progression of the cartoon industry would do well to purchase this title. In keeping with the intention of the release the content features blatant stereotyping and risqué material and should not be viewed by those of a sensitive disposition.In summary, treat this DVD as a dose of cartoon history and you won't be disappointed - 13 fantastic shorts with enough taboo about them to be classed as `banned and censored' - not quite an animated Lady Chatterley's Lover, but it'll do."
2,More Gems Mishandled by Cartoon Crazys,"With such a great business plan-- buy up obscure, forgotten and public domain cartoons on the cheap and rerelease them in themed anthologies-- you'd think it would be hard to go wrong. Nearly all of Cartoon Crazys' collections though, show little affection or even respect for the source material: there's been no visual remastering, so the prints look as if they were taped from afternoon ""Cartoon Carnival"" programs (which they may well have been), and irritating, out-of-place sound effects have been added to ""enhance"" the soundtrack. You might, for instance, hear a familiar effect from the Hanna-Barbera library injected into a much earlier toon such as an MGM or a Betty Boop.If you are a serious collector and spot a title here that you really want, well, it might be worth it. Otherwise, don't waste your money.Cartoon Crazy's Fairy TalesCartoon Crazys: Goes to War"
2,A Major disappointment,"First of all, the title...Banned and Censored...by whom? The Pvt. Snafus were made for the military (certainly THEY didn't ban them) and Easy Does It is a 20 min. commercial for a canned vegitable company (who the audience for that was and where it was presented eludes me..) The rest were released for general consumption, but again, banned by whom? The studio? Hayes code?Distributors? TV?Secondly, the reasons for their being banned are often quetionable at best, ludicrous at worst. Alleged homosexuality from clothed bathing? PLEASE!Thirdly, with the exception of the delightful Betty Boop/Koko films and the Snafu shorts, the remaining 'toons don't even cut it as entertaining (IMO). THat's my two cents...YMMV"
4,Comedy,Great to watch the old cartoons. the new ones don't have the flavor of great humor and cartoon action.
2,For collectors only.,"There are better collections out there if you want high quality wartime cartoons. These look more like rejects, with the exception of the Snafu cartoons."
2,Banned and Censored,"Well a few good titles in the whole dvd don't make this worth it. If you want to archive some racist animation, there are a few on here. Spend your money on something else."
3,Love Toons?,"I find myself a big fan of the classic cartoons. I love anything from Bettie Boop to Pinky and the Brain but I found myself a little dissappointed when I watched this DVD. There are some cool scenes that I won't spoil for ya but you might be better off buying ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" to get your dose of classic cartoons."
3,Funny but...,"I found the movie funny but very age sensitive. This is not something that I could watch with my kids and due to the content there are many freinds that I could not watch this with. I like the message of stronger women. Although this is geared toward specific ethnicities, I believe that the messages Tyler Perry is sending don't necessarily need to be race specific but are very gender specific. This was also a homework assignment but I wouldn't mind watching it as entertainment either."
1,Madea's Family Reunion Advertisement on Amazon.com,"I ordered this the other day thinking it was the movies coming out early because you had it advertised as the movie 2006 with the right characters. i'm glad you changed it because it was false advertisement, but you still have the wrong characters listed. those folk were in the actual movie, not the play. And China Anderson is definately not in the play!"
1,This is not the movie!,Beware this is not the movie with Blair Underwood and that super fine babe from T. P.'s show.
5,TYLER PERRY,A VERY NICE AND THOUGHTOUT MOVIE WITH LIFE SAVING INFORMATION THAT A PERSON CAN USE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIC
4,My Review,It was very comfortable and very sexy. It seems my love was very satisfied with this product as well *laughs*. It wasn't at all uncomfortable feeling material and it fit my curves very well. I'm a very happy customer
3,Nice product but watch out - the package doesn't include the panty,"Careful when ordering this. Although the picture shows both the bra and panty, only the bra ships; the panty is not included in the package.Other than that, the bra is very nice. My wife loves it but she would have loved the panties as displayed in the picture."
3,a real jamaican's veiw,T.O.K is okay they are a group in jamaica who are trying to make money for them. They have a lot of old and new songs. Chi chi mon is any who likes that song. Shake ur bam bam is only for Real jamaicans because americans have no booty.
4,The best of the best here,That person who said the cd is bad is a bloodclawt fool and he or she should kindly go an suck out his or her mumma.T.O.K. is the best anybody nuh like dat jump offa a blood clawt bridge.
1,Reject T.O.K. Homophobia!,"Jamaican gay men and lesbians are increasingly under attack because of the murderous content of dancehall from T.O.K. - crazy beats for sure.From the Guardian U.K.: ""As a black gay man of Jamaican descent, let me translate a few typical lyrics from the patois. 'Shoot a bullet in a gay man's spine' (Vybz Kartel); ""Queers who get together in a car ... let's burn them, burn them!"" (TOK). Biggy C and co's silly remarks are representative of people who care for nothing but having a good time and believe issues like homophobia, sexism and racism are irrelevant. (Letter, Ted Brown, Chair, Black Lesbians and Gays Against Homophobia)"
1,tick T.O.K. this doesnt rock,Had the misfortune in listening to this terrible CD. My homes and the big dawg couldnt believe our shell likes....with a glok and a knock we bit the ring and did it big style G's...the good thing about this shiny disc is that it stops me mug delivering ring burns to me chippenfield man....
5,Baudrillard sees the Emperor naked again,"Contemporary ""art"" endlessing pleasing itself with how ""clever"" it is - how ""important"" it is - how ""valuable"" it is. Baudrillard sees through it all and offers some great critiques. Again, to some he may seem the seer of the obvious but others put up great resistance to his ideas because it destroys their privileged, little cozy world. The film Zoolander does much the same thing with its hilarious send-up of the ""fashion"" world - the ""Derelique"" campaign, turning the ""look"" of homeless people into the latest haute-couture. The fashion world is a conspiracy and so is the contemporary art world. The commodification of the banal - the banal world turned into ""brilliant"" concepts by art stuporstars. I think Baudrillard would agree with Hansel in Zoolander when he says: ""Derelique"" my balls."
1,"""Winning"" Six Heros, I think NOT","how can one say victory after a few million people lost their lives in all the proxy wars, I couldn't understand why this author ""praises"" these people, communism fell under it's own faulty economic structure. I thought when I first picked up this book, lets see what he has to say, by the time I finished the book I was disgusted! How can ANY side claim victory in a war, everybody loses in a war, everybody."
5,"Excellent, elegantly written and insightful","Excellent book. Engaging, informative and a quick read. Tells you more about Reagan in 60 pages than Edmund Morris did in 600. And Shattan gets it right, too. Every one of these six portraits is beautifully crafted: scholarly without being pedantic (telling you exactly as much as you need to know without a lot of extraneous information), and reads like a novel. A history that's a real page-turner! Read it."
4,Not bad,"In some ways this is really outstanding. The list of musical guests and hosts is simply icredible. On the one hand you have the Rolling Stones, Devo, The Talking Heads , the Blues Bothers, the Grateful Dead and others and as hosts you have Carrie Fisher, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and others. Plus you have the original SNL cas with Belushi, Radner and co. This is simply TV history at its best. The down side is that again, the transfer quality is not as goos as it should be for something of this quality. What is also interesting is that while there is some of the best comedy ever, some of it was also very very self-indulgent and at times simply not funny (as Weekly Update) and gives the impression of some stoned students indulging in what they think is funny. However the sheer quantity of what you get is incredible"
4,It's Zappa!,"What more need be said? A fine musician and composer,far more wide ranging in his talents than just ""Yellow Snow"",or ""Valley Girl"". He was most influenced by an album called ""ionisation"" by Edgard Varese. The social commentary stuff just paid the bills. ""Music-and Frank Zappa are the best""."
5,"""Season 4 of SNL is awesome""","The 1978-79 season of ""SNL"" marked the final appearances of John Belushi & Dan Aykroyd as cast members-They announced they were leaving the show to pursue other interests-Season 4 had some memorable guest hosts:Frank Zappa,Carrie Fisher,Walter Matthau,Eric Idle & Michael Palin from ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" & ""Mr.Television"" himself Milton Berle-The same can be said about the musical guests which included Devo,The Rolling Stones,Van Morrison,The Doobie Brothers,James Taylor & Bette Midler-If you have the first three seasons of ""SNL"",you need to add this one to your collection."
2,DRM Crippled,"Unfortunately, this download is so crippled with Digital Rights Management that you are SEVERELY restricted with respect to the machines and ways that you can view it. I should have known - what do you expect from the company that deletes files from Kindle owners' collections after the customers have bought them? These will NOT download onto a Mac or Linux computer, or to an iPod, iPhone, etc. Only to a Windows machine with specific software installed. Of course, you don't find out about this until after you've purchased the program. Skip Amazon's DRM crippled downloads; find somewhere else to purchase them, instead."
3,Not as funny as I remember,"Bought this for a friend for her birthday that had never seen the old SNL. I raved about how funny they were. Then we sat down to watch them (only bot through the first couple) and they were completely lame. I was really embarrassed. I think they definitely had a few funny ones and that was what I remember, but they certainly weren't all that funny!"
1,Missing episodes #5 & #20,"Do not buy the Saturday Night Live Season 4 from Amazon.com Video On Demand because for whatever reason they have decided to leave out 2 episodes. I say ""no thank you"" to Amazon for your attempt at censorship and would refer people to iTunes to purchase the actual full season that includes episodes #5 & #20.Get your act together Amazon. Until I see this corrected I will no longer purchase anything from Amazon's Video On Demand."
4,SNL-Complete Fourth Season,"The '78-'79 Season,the peak of the show,and the last to feature John Belushi & Dan Ackroyd.Some classic stuff here.It's dated a wee bit,maybe not quite as funny as it was 30 years ago,but still great stuff...Let's see if they go further and put out season 5..."
4,Why the sloppy transfer??,"What's the deal with the sloppy transfer?? Just purchased this set for the great skits and the Devo live performance. Why do I have color bleeds from Devo's uniforms on far shots? The close ups are fine but the far shots are not. It is not a major issue but it sure takes away from the enjoyment of the performance. It reminds me of copies of tv shows I would tape on my old vcr, some would have these bleeding trails on brightly lit colors. I haven't watched any of the other shows completely but this was evident on other episodes, not as much as in the Devo presentation. Do I have a bad copy or has Universal once again, cut corners to make a buck. Would like to know if it's just my copy or is this prevalent on other SNL sets?"
3,Harder faster,"This April wine offering is studio/bar tunes worthy. Feet tapping, fast running rock'in roll, 20th century schizoid man is not Crimson but they pull it off."
5,Harder Faster,This isn't one of those albums where there are just one are two good songs. The whole album is great!
4,If you haven't seen them live....,"While Spirit Electricity is not the length of The Youth Are Getting Restless, the live intensity of Bad Brains is there. Any dub by H.R. is worth hearing, and while the studio recordings are great, they are nowhere near the sheer power contained in a live Bad Brains show. Who knows? This may be the only way to hear them live..."
5,"Gorgeous watch, Awesome price!","big manly watch, sticks out and is a pleasure to look at! Couldn't beat the price, got it for 2179.00 (cheapest otherwise was over 3000) seemed to good to be true, but the seller came through and I couldn't be happier!"
5,It's simply a Must-Read!!,"This book is AMAZING. Originally I hardly read anything other than the Harry Potter series, but once I picked up a book from the Daughters of the Moon series, I just couldn't put it down. In this book, Serena deals with some complicated ""evil boy problems"". As a goddess who knows how to read minds, she has had a hard time getting a boyfriend. When she meets Zahi, whose thoughts are all in different languages, she thought that he was the perfect guy. However, her memory is acting really strange, and she forgets the warnings given by ""the boy she really loves"". She is getting tempted to join the Atrox, which Jimena foresees. Will Serena choose her friends? Or not?"
5,Into the Cold Fire,This series is the best I have ever read! I started them two weeks ago and I am already on the fourth book! It is a book you cant put down!
2,Into Confusion and Oblivion,"I don't know how Lynne Ewing came up with this story. I was looking forward to reading about Serena because she seemed to be one of the more interesting characters and I was left sorely disappointed. I don't understand how you can have a romance in a book and not really give the reader anything to go on. If Serena can't remember her memories, then how are we supposed to get a feel for a connection between her and Stanton? They had absolutely no chemistry to me. Stanton and Vanessa seemed to have more chemistry (later I found out Lynne Ewing was originally going to hook those two up). Too bad Lynne didn't hook Michael up with someone else later in the series. Personally, I think Vanessa and Stanton would have made a better couple. I understand others might have a different opinion, but that's just how I feel about it.I give it two stars for at least being well-written, if not the most interesting or the best of the series. So far, it's my least favorite."
2,Not as good as the first book,"Usually series improve over their course. Hopefully this will still hold true with the other books. However, I found this book very blah. Serena was a character I was unable to get a firm understanding of--perhaps due to her mental confusion in the book, it made her less sympathetic than a heroine should be though. And being a fan of the character Stanton, I really don't understand his draw to her. There is some character trait that she has that needs to be delved into, as to why he would like her better than Vanessa (who he did have chemistry with) and why she would be so susceptible to the dark forces. Not just her super power. I did like her brother Collin and Wally the raccoon, however Morgan is a character that is very flat and deserves better treatment."
3,"It was a good book, but it's not for me.","Into the Cold Fire is about a relationship between four girls who have one special thing in common: they are goddesses. This book is a must read if you like to read about a little bit of fantasy and science fiction at the same time. In a world of jealousy and betrayal, Serena and her friends (Vanessa, Jimnea, and Catty) must stand up for each other even when the time gets rough. The theme of the book is pretty simple. It is believe your friends, forgive your friends, and expect the unexpected.One of Serena's friends, Jimnea, has premonitions (she can see the future.) She had a vision that Serena would betray them, her friends. They are the Daughters of the Moon and they are always supposed to have each other's back. Jimnea visions usually come true, so they are worried that this vision about Serena might actually come true. But, they still have Serena's back and try to help her even though Jimnea saw the vision. That is true friendship!"
5,Serena is cool!,"This book has a lot of romance, especially a forbidden one. Serena also doesn't care what others thing about her. This is a great series and I hope Lynne keeps up the good work."
5,Another World,"This was the first book given to me of the 8 so far. I loved it! I anticipate the day a new book comes out. I even wrote the author about how much i loved it, and she sent me a book back signed to me, with a letter IN HER HAND WRITING! This book led me into another world. A mystical real world. I LOVED IT, AND RECOMEND IT TO ALL READERS!"
5,Into the Cold Fire,"""Into the Cold Fire"" was a wonderful book. It was interesting and very different from what I normally read. I read it all the first night I got it, I just could not put it down. It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next! A great book for teenagers to adults."
2,Opera failure and performance to match,"Presumably Opera D'Oro and Gala use unauthorized recordings, from the audience, at least up to 1970. The sound in this 1956 performance is so bad it is difficult to judge the singers. Gobbi and Corelli were stars, but you would not know it. Frazzoni is an unknown, doomed by the recording. Some mistakenly try to place this opera alongside the composer's works of genius. The Americanisms are hokey, the music could be rejects from Boheme, Butterfly and Turandot. The finale is affecting, but the opera's absence from the stage is condign."
3,Not worth the price,"From both functional and statistical perspective, the price is way to high for its value. I ended up with buying a four pair tool set from Costco. I would say it is an okay buy if you have spare money ..."
5,Le Creuset = Great investment.,"I just love everything Le Creuset. The best cookware I have ever purchased and also a great investment because of the price tag. If your like me you have purchased a lot of moderately priced cookware an within the first year its lackluster, not as good when first purchased, and in some cases it rusts. So this time around I would buy quality cookware pieces that are know to last, I thought about buying Staub cookware but I went with my gut and started buying Le Creuset one piece at a time when needed. This crock was one of the things I needed to organize my kitchen, and excellent because its also great for baking brioche. Might be the only utensil crock that you can do that with, an absolute must buy if shopping for a utensil holder."
5,heavy duty stonware croc,"i love this croc, i purchased mine at nebraska furniture mart for 30 dollars. it is fuctional, holds many utensils, and because it is so heavy there is no fear of tipping it over. my only color choice was white, a definate must have. would be great as a gift and stands up to the le creuset legacy of excellence. *****"
1,Don't bother,"There are only three short films on this DVD.The Wooden Clogs With The Red StrapsRegenerationLast Day as a TeenagerIf you like classic ghost stories/legends, the first one might be for you. Don't however, expect to be scared. These aren't even remotely creepy. A man stays with a family and meets their reclusive daughter with a limp. She is mysterious and warns him to stay away from the temple. The family has a secret- and there are no surprises here.Regeneration is a quick tale of a girl who can grow back body parts that are cut off. She gets married, gets dementia, again no scares and you can guess the rest.Last day as a teenager - This one is another classic ghost story about a boy who makes a deal with death- and then tries to get out of it while he tries to protect his girlfriend."
3,"this is alright, not that good","when i first saw this dvd, my immediate reaction was, ""wow, this is awesome."" i brought it at some store (i can't remember) and went home to see it. some songs and videos were awesome and some just plainly stunk. the only ones i liked were, the counting crows, gary numan, madonna, lionel richie, and brian mcknight. mtv should have put more thought into choosing which videos had more of an impact. but then again mtv doesn't even play music videos anymore except for boring hillary duff and 50 cent. i guess this dvd was alright, nothing special."
2,Poor videos choices ruin it,"MTV, or it used to be, one of the best ideas for the TV. Music videos were a great idea for the TV, until MTV made crappy shows, then it went extremly downhill. Now the only shows on MTV that are worthwhile are Pimp My Ride, The Ashlee Simpson Show, and maybe the RR/RW show is aight, but other than that, MTV sucks now considering they play more crappy show like Punk'd, Jack***, and other junk rather than doing what their idea was in the 80's, shows music videos. Anyway, I'm not going to waste my review bashing MTV, I'm going to review the DVD. Well, it's kinda hard to make a DVD of the biggest songs of 1982-2002, and MTV did an ok job on it. Mainly because MTV put on so-so to forgettable videos on the DVD. Some of these videos are also low quality, but, just buy the DVD if you see it for half-price somewhere, but other than that, this DVD is wasting your money."
2,Not enough content,Needs more videoes and the description of the videoes has to have all the songs on it. I got what I paid for!
4,half and half,"I really like Tears for Fear and Pink Floyd ,so for me it was worth getting.I was hopping for some of the older genesis songs so I was a little dissapointed when they were not there."
1,The WORST Audio and Video I have EVER seen,"I was very excited to get a bunch of MTV videos but upon opening the nice looking DVD case of 4 DVD's and playing every single video... I felt like throwing them in the fireplace. They are the WORST videos I have ever seen from the 80's (except maybe a handful). I cannot beleive MTV would release some of their worst videos as their hits. Someone at MTV needs to be fired. And on top of that, the audio is horrible. I mean horrible audio. DO NOY BUY THIS. I will ship it to you for 10 bucks and they are brand new. Viewed only once and will never be viewed again. I am embarassed for MTV."
1,Very disappointed.,Out of this 4 DVD set I could only find a hand full of decent videos. Half the video seems to be unknowns and rap music.
2,Avengers: The Ultimate Guide,I liked it but i wish that they would have put more info about some of the characters...over all good.
2,Crock Untensil,We need pictures of this so we know if it matches our kitchen or not. Please get some pictures so you can sell these. Thanks
3,Reconsider it!!,"At first I thought that the Masterpiece Theater ""Dracula"" was a misguided dud. But then I watched it again and maybe it is not such a bomb. It is a restructuring of the focus on the characters. The music is very good and the sets are good. The acting is ok in all characters EXCEPT Count Dracula. The Dracula character starts out fine, creepy in fact, but the face and person are all wrong.Never mind that. It improves with viewing. The trick is to get it for about $7 or $8."
4,A different take on Dracula!,I really enjoyed the Masterpiece Theatre's version of Dracula. Sophia Myles as Lucy was quite different from other versions I've seen. Sophia is an exceptional actress and played the role extremely well. As I like vampire stories this one was really quite well done.
3,Dracula,This is not the usual Dracula movie from the early 50's. Just a little story type that has added a new perspective to the movie.
3,Dracula tamed and confused,"This version hit all the basic elements with a few new twists; it's heavier on the betrayal and human corruption than most other modern versions and lighter on the sexual tension. There's no effort to redeem Dracula in the subtext as just another fella blighted by love. It lacks the elegance of some older versions, but adds some grit. The plot is a bit slow-going; at no point was I engrossed, but it is nonetheless an interesting interpretation of a classic tale."
2,Not very good,"This version of Dracula is not very good. First of all, Dracula himself looks rather silly, and the Van Helsing character is a joke. Stick with the versions where Gary Oldman and Frank Langella plays the blood thirsty count from Transylvania."
1,"This DVD should be called ""CRAPULA""",The WORST Dracula I have seen in a very long time. I would rather watch the 1970's Frankenstine vs Dracula then this garbage! If you really want the best movie find the masterpiece theatre Dracula by the BBC in 1979(?)Please don't waste your time with this stink bomb!!!!!
1,Skip This. Watch the 1977 BBC Version instead.,"What the hell was the BBC thinking when they made this? The BBC produced a fantastic version of Dracula back in 1977 -- Count Dracula starring Louis Jourdan. Don't waste your money on this, instead get the 1977 BBC version instead. You'll be glad you did."
2,Disappointed,"Took too lo g to arrive, ended up getting it in a store 50 miles away, but it didn't work, fish died anyway, not even got better even a little bit."
1,Does not fit Single DIN,Bought the dash kit with excitement of installing a new JVC stereo on 01 TT.It's size is wrong as if someone made it 80% smaller?There is no way any Single DIN can fit into this trim kit.Now I have to grind the trim to fit the DIN...
3,A little fact-checking would be good.,"Gentile says Johnny Ray was the 1982 Rookie of the Year, but it was Steve Sax. He also says a National League pitcher threw a no-hitter again the Rangers, an American League team. I couldn't care less, but I'm married to a baseball nut who likes to point out these errors, and it can be a little, shall we say, tiring."
2,Disappointment,"Great album in its original form, but four of the six songs are cut. This is basically the same chopped down version that is available on the 2-for-1 disc with ""A Song for You."" Go for the LP if you still own a turntable -- it's the only way you'll get uncut versions of ""Hey Girl"" and ""Hurry Tomorrow."""
1,bad movie,"first off if u can not afford color do not make a movie and do not give me black and white is for effect cause the only effect i got was how bad this movie is.second the story was stupid.third also stupid was having the actors talked through gas masks the entire movie.forth was the movie is 150 minates long.what did this guy think he was making,gone with the wind or titanic."
1,awful,"Q: How do you cover up the fact that your acting is poor and dialog worse?A: Wear NBC protective masks, and don't mike them up.Q: How to use up the extra tape in your hand held video recorder?A: Film your buddies and you playing cards while wearing pro-masks for several minutes. Ensure any dialog is unintelligible and cannot progress the plot of your story as a result.Q: How to waste hard earned dollars?A: Buy a copy of The Veil!This movie was just awful. I'm sure the guys had fun making it, and more fun watching it and seeing themselves on thier TVs. However, like the ashtray I made from playdoh for my Dad back in kindergarten, it is a treasure only enjoyed by those who made it. Unfortunately, the makers of the Veil decided to market their movie. I wish I could sell my playdoh ashtray and recoup some of the money I wasted on this DVD.If you have to watch it, watch it on a DVD player which allows you to fast forward at least 4x speed. That way you will waste much less of your life...."
1,blowsssssssss,you should run from this movie. dont waste a penny. you have no clue what is happenning. cant understand a word the men are saying. a total ripoff. awful. run for your life.
2,Muga bluba blah blah Gubva (wearing gas mask),"I wanted to like The Veil, but I found it VERY hard to understand what the people in the movie were saying. I tried turning it up but the underlying hiss on the sound was too much. The camera work gave me motion sickness and the grainy B/W picture had a nasty habit of cutting to complete black. At the end I wasn't sure who was whom.....did the bad guy get shot at the ""RV"" point or did he get thrown off the roof. I gave this movie 2 stars only because I liked the overall idea. I think the producers of this film should spent more time on the back story of the characters instead of ""stretch"" shots (such as the 5 minute card game)."
4,pretty darn good.,"I have listened to this album on the subway everyday for a week now. This some of the best hardcore / metal I've encountered in a good while. They have a fast paced heavy sound, with some of the best vocals I have ever heard. I am starting to believe that all of today's best metal comes from slightly obscure bands like this one. These guys are definitely worth checking out."
3,"It's a FIENNE'S Movie, but only for FIENNES.","This motion picture has the honor of being the longest film ever made, an achievement originally held by Chris Nolan's `Dark Knight' in 2008 and then broken by Sunshine in 2001.This film was made for and will only appeal to fans of Ralph Fiennes. I cannot imagine any other reason to ever watch it, other than if maybe you needed to choose between having a root canal and watching something, like a certain movie. You know how sometimes people say, ""I'd rather have a root canal than watch this."" Well, this could be the film you were referring to having to choose between watching or having that painful dental procedure.It's that much of a Ralph Fiennes Fan Movie."
1,Felt sorry for the actors and the audience,"The story had plenty of potential, but the characters and content were poorly developed.... a commercial caricature of the past."
1,Very little payoff,"Although this movie is beautifully filmed, I felt disappointed in the end and wished that I hadn't spent three hours watching it. It is interesting from a historical point of view, but there is only one genuinely good character in this movie (the father) and he dies fairly close to the beginning. Other characters seem to change drastically with no explanation. You have to sit through a gruesome torture scene and several incredibly ridiculous sex scenes and to me, in the end, it just wasn't worth it."
2,RAIN ON SUNSHINE.,"I had very high expectations for the movie, unfortunately it did not live up to any of them. Though the movie is about a Jewish family during and after the World War II, it is hardly uplifting. The characters were very unsympathetic. I can only give it 2 stars due to the quality of the acting. Overall, I feel that I wasted 3 hours of my life that I will never get back."
5,Accurate and moving,"Sunshine tells the moving story of 4 generations of a Hungarian Jewish family. Many of the details in this movie relate to my own family's story, including the importance of the ""brew,"" which was actually a common product of the northeastern Hungarian region."
5,How a movie SHOULD be made!,"I'm going to keep this review short. The film was one of the best I have seen. Acting aside, the cinematography and script were what made the story. At three hours I was hoping it would go on for another 2 because I wanted to watch the characters develop even more. If you ever find yourself saying ""what ever happened to all the great movies they used to make?"" then please see Sunshine. It is nice to see that great epics didn't end with Dr. Zhivago . . .the next generation has hope!"
3,PAL,It was not emphasized in the ad that the DVD is in PAL and I can not play it unless convert it to the american sysytem.
2,Where is the soul?,"This film would have been far more better with Hungarian acteurs. The whole soul of identity and temper vanished into clisjees by the american way. I don't know why the director went into this trap. The masking of the protagonist Ralph Finnes into the different roles made it to a non believable story – was thinking more about the make up then the message from the acteur. The story is interesting, painful and beautiful, but is not taking me enough because of some surface acting which was kind of irritating. With the resourses this project may got, the results I expected was not met. The photographic part of it was indeed splendid."
3,"Over hyped, over long and over rated.","This movie just left me with the feeling will it ever finish, it just goes on and on. It is not a terrible movie by any means. But nor does it really deserve the hype that surounded it. Fiennes is a very talented actor, but it is almost like he is trying to find his new ""The English patient."" This movie wanted the comment epic. And it is epic in length. It is just way to long. The pace is so slow it almost feels that you could live through the time periods sooner than finsh this film. It could have been alot better and shorter. The film just tries to hard to be artsy. It has moments of pure brilliance and is worth watching. It just isn't worthy of all the praise."
2,Failed to live up to its potential,"Sunshine has a great number of good points: beautiful cinematography, wonderful music, Budapest's great scenery, and a good cast. However, all these assets were wasted on soap opera-like melodrama and gratuitous sex scenes. The female characters, even Valerie to some extent, are cyphers that are only there to seduce the three characters played by Ralph Fiennes. I am disappointed with Mr. Fiennes' choice of roles in the past several years as he only seems to reprise his role in The English Patient over and over again. Instead of the melodrama and trite symbolism, the film could have further explored the characters' drives for assimilation and faith. The tumultuous political events and their impact on the characters' lives are not fully explored and only play second fiddle to Mr. Fiennes' posterior."
1,Used but Good???,"Thankfully the DVD was playable ... based on the ""jacket"" and the condition of the DVD it was doubtful that we would be satisfied with the purchase. Definitely not used to this kind of product coming out of AMAZON.In my future purchases I will demand ""AMAZON - NEW ONLY"". The ""jacket"" was soiled, with what I have no idea and the DVD itself looked a bit ""battle scarred"", but as mentioned before playable. Almost returned because of the jacket condition."
4,EXCELLENT HISTORICAL SAGA,"This is a very good film. It leads us from the Autria-Hungarian Empire to Nazi regime in the flesh of a family of jewish origin that wants, all the time, to ""belong"" to the country they live in. So much that they ignore the dangers of the rising of nazism and pay for it.Incredible fencing scenes, as one of the members of the family becomes World Champion representing Hungary, but with the contradictiosn on a society that do not accept jewish religion as one suitable for prominent citizens, or high state employees.A very well filmed saga that shows the turn of the century from ""middle Europe empires"" point of view."
4,Very Touching,"The scenes in the concentration camp are so haunting and beautifully done, they have stayed with me for years. It's a wonderful story and I have watched it over and over."
4,Sunshine is a celebration of Ralph Fiennes' acting abilities,"Sunshine is a beautiful film about a changing Jewish family. The film spans over three generations as the family undergoes many hardships. There does remain one constant though, Ralph Fiennes portrays a character in each generation. You see some of the same mistakes and concequences that his fathers before him repeated. Yet each of the three different roles that Ralph portrays is quite difinely unique. Sunshine truely is a celebration of Ralph Fienes' acting abilities."
3,Good but not as good as my original that I lost,"At the time I bought this, black wasn't an option (grey is not my favorite). Its not as comfortable as the original that came with the stethoscope, and I don't think hearing was as good either. But since I lost one of my old original buds I needed the replacement. Its an okay sub but I expected a little better from Littmann."
4,Good oldie,"Great movie :a good old fashioned ""Tarzan type"" movie from yesteryear; love those hero/heroine films. Restores my faith in the creative human spirit"
5,Another joyous bonanza of Scandanavian tunes !,"I'm a huge fan of this series. Not only are these some of the most affordable samplers, but they are some of the most enjoyable. Number 3 in the series is as strong as the first two, with some familiar names and some new folks, too !!Normally samplers are a bit of a hit-and-miss. You like some of the songs, but grimace a little at others. Not this series. Nordic Roots have a consistency and logic to the order in which the songs are presented that make them a very coherent and pleasant listen from start to finish. Even the Hoven Droven song fits in !There's a joy to scandanavian music that is reminiscent of the most upbeat Celtic tunes, with which they also share a certain mournfulness. Imagine dancing around the may-pole with fiddle and/or accordian accompaniment or visualize the slow-swirling fog of the moors, and you'll have the right idea.Nordic Roots 3 starts off strongly, and you'll get a good sample by listening to the first two tracks !!"
3,A fine continuation,"The Nordic Roots samplers are a bargin, no lie, so go ahead and pick up the whole set, but while this one is fine, it's not the greatest sampler they've done, and if you are only curious about Nordic music, grab the second one instead."
5,Absolutely the best of Nordic Roots!,"This is the best of the Nordic Roots yet!! Wonderful sounds,beats, and beautifully done! Great to read by, listenwhile painting, or just plain relaxing."
4,Explore the Exotic intoxicating vibrant diverse sounds!,"I have all three of the Nordic Roots, so far, this is by far the best one. The music is enticing and exciting, with various rythms and mixes of music that comes out smoothly and very interestingly. There is a jazz feel in some songs, a native sound that resonates of old Viking roots, and the combination is refreshing. It's great when the albums keep getting better as this series of Roots has! It has been a great exploration of my own nordic roots, talent, originality, ingenuity all describe this one! Thanks to the talented artists!"
2,hoped it would work for me.,"i attempted to take this on 2 separate occasions, it made me feel dizzy light headed, and nauseated both times, guess all things just dont work for all people,"
3,I wish I could say good things about this DVD,"I am not a long time Kun Qu fan. I got interested in it about 3 years ago. It was not an easy task to learn to appreciate the beauty and excitement of Kun Qu. But once I learned something about Kun Qu, I was totally obsessed with it. People who publish this DVD might think this way: since it is hard to appreciate Kun Qu, let's put lots of bells and whistles in this production to make it ""exciting."" Well, succeed indeed they. A lot of scenes are selected for this DVD simply because in these scences the stage is crowded with acrobats, exotic costumes, or fashionable stage design. I am not against those stage elements per se. But where is the performance? I want the performance! I really wish I could say something good about this DVD. I heard that the original 19-hours production was quite an achievement. Unfortunately, they picked up the dessert but left out the main dishes to produce this DVD."
3,as good as back then,except I was sure there was more than 8 episodes in a season. Yet they call it a complete season.
4,Worth It,"I agree that I felt 40.00 was a little steep for only 8 episodes, but I love the show so much I would have paid even more. I figure if paying a little more now, ensures that there will be additioanl Seasons released, I am willing to pay it. I watched the show when it originally aired and I watched at least three cycles of every episode when it was on A&E then Hallmark bought it and stuck it in a drawer somewhere. I had just been really missing it when I saw this DVD was coming out. I live in Washington and have been to Roslyn where NX was filmed and I still have my Chris-in-the-morning t-shirt. I can't wait for all of the rest!!"
4,Great,I love the fact that Nothern Exposure is finally out on DVD. I hate two sided DVD's so the jury is still out on that one but I hope to see more to come...
3,"Best show ever, bad DVD release","If you're a Northern fan, you can't not buy this. That said, the amount of work put into the production and packaging (aside from the cute parka) of this DVD is absolute minimal. No epsiode list?? Not even a sound track while viewing menus? I don't feel ripped off paying $40 for the first season only, as this is the best televison show ever created, but I do feel bad that Universal didn't put more of an effort into it. Cicely and her residents deserve better!"
5,I Love Northern Exposure,"This is a quality dvd set. It is a little pricy, but it is worth it. You get a lot of extras, etc.There is a guy by the name of Art selling bootleg discs from ottowa. His are as expensive but the framerate is so low (around 2 mb/sec). He copied them from cable to a dvd recorder squeezing 5 episodes on per disc... WOAH!These commerically released discs are professioanl quality all the way. Framerate is very high, to be expected of a commercial release. Sound is incredible.If you are a fan, you will not be dissappointed to have these discs in your dvd collection!Ted K"
1,A Rip-Off,"$41.99 for 8 episodes. What a Rip-Off. The Dukes of Hazard is $27.99 for its 13 episode first season. M*A*S*H is $27.99 for a 26 episode season (30 minutes per episode). By this cost method episodes cost about $2.00 each, whereas Northern Exposure is $5.00 per episode. This is WAY out of line."
2,Technical Difficulties... and no response,"I love Northern Exposure, and I'm definitely buying season 2. However, I'm going to have to re-purchase season 1 due to defects. The Aurora Borealis episode won't play a few scenes (it actually requires me to eject the disk, put it back in, and then fast forward through the hanging scenes). I've read that this is a common problem for people. Unfortunately, I was past Amazon's return window when this happened, and Universal doesn't stand by their quality...Great show! Unfortunately, not given the handling it deserves."
5,Costs,"To moviemancritter: the reason, I suspect, that the first season Northern Exposure DVD set carries a steepish price for a mere 8 episodes has to do with the music. NoEx was well known for incorporating music into many of its episodes (so much so that there are two CD releases of some of these songs) and in order for Universal to keep these episodes in tact, complete with the music and songs that were originally used, means that each and every one of these songs must be licensed. These licensing costs, as well as the long legal work involved, costs money and, assuming that all the original songs will be kept, is almost certainly why this set costs a bit more than other comparable DVD sets of TV shows."
4,Yet another NX comment,"For those who are in disbelief about the small number of episodes on the first two DVD sets, here is a good guide: http://epguides.com/NorthernExposure/As many others do, I also find it shocking that the production is so sloppy and I'd gladly trade in the silly ""jackets"" for DVDs labeled correctly and a slip of paper listing the contents. The stars are definitely for the show itself and not the DVDs."
1,Very poorly done,"Not only do the shows lack the unique music that made them so much better than they already were, but the picture quality is very poor. I have 15 year old VHS tapes, and I still use them to watch the shows because they look better and have the original music. Even the packaging and the discs themselves are flimsy! Don't waste your money on this. It seems like it was done quickly to make some fast cash. In fact, I urge people to contact Universal and request a better release. I did!"
5,"If You Don't Love Northern Exposure,You Need Help!!","In my opinion,Northern Exposure is at the top of the top five television series of all time, and I've been watching television since the 1950s! It is unbelievably great writing that is then brought to life by perfect acting, fabulous scenery, great music ... well, it is perfect and I absolutely love every visit to Cicely, Alaska, no matter how many times I've been there before. This is brilliant work - funny, quirky, sad, touching, profound; it's comedy, drama, philosophy, religion, it's Life - the whole ball of wax - and it's work that is in love with Life in ALL of its aspects!Now the real point of this review is this: WHEN, OH WHEN, WILL SEASON 3 AND BEYOND BE AVAILABLE??!! PLEASE HURRY!! WE ARE LINED UP AT YOUR DOORS WAITING FOR ALL OF THE REST OF THE NORTHERN EXPOSURE SEASONS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE. PLEASE! HURRY!"
5,Love the show but...........,"Come on 8 episodes for 45$ what a rip, everything combined together equals to a little more than 6 total hours of viewingas sais on back of the dvd - Better off to wait and get it used!"
5,Northern Exposure on DVD at Last!,"I was so happy when I learned that Northern Exposure was going to be released on DVD. I have waited so long for this, and I can't wait to receive my shipment of the first season. If you have never experienced Northern Exposure, this is one DVD collection that you will absolutely love. I am hoping that the other seasons will soon follow the release of the first one. This is my favorite all-time show. The characters made me want to move to Cicely Alaska to live with them! I have seen every episode muliple times, and I never grow tired of watching it. Northern Exposure was a really great show that will be awesome in DVD. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this series. You will be an instant fan!"
1,bring the price down or raise the quality of the product,"look.... As consumers, and more importantly as fans, we deserve more than what is being offered here. Sloppy packaging, a high price, nothing of substance except the episodes. The delay in satisfying the demand of putting the episodes of NX on dvd commands more attention to detail than this. Share your voice by saving your money."
4,WE care - why don't you?,"Northern Exposure has long been a favorite of mine. I foundit on re-runs one nite - and got hooked. While in Oregon,I found sale tapes and taped ( I think ) almost 110 episodes.Now it's on DVD. What's up?? The episodes are not in order- the pilot is missing - possible the most important episode,and all the ""extras"" repeat. What a waste. Without all thatjunk - the powers that be might have arranged everything inorder. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Put the entirecollection on DVD.I KNOW I'm not alone - Do something. We are starviing.And take the time to do it right. Thank you. (...)I would have used 5 stars- the show is worth it - the production of the DVD leaves much to be desired."
1,RIP OFF - Only 8 Episodes,"The ""COMPLETE"" First Season is only 8 Episodes.This is a 2 disc set for a list price of [$$$].To give you an example of what TV Shows on DVD currently cost from other studios, you can buy ""Gilmour Girls- Season 1"" for the same amount and that is 6 discs, 21 epsidodes, deleted scenes, etc.This has got to be the MOST EXPENSIVE TV DVD EVER per episode.Yet another Universal RIP OFF!!"
3,2 stars because the DVD format needs work...,"I loved this show and the DVD's do give that to me. However I hate 2 sided discs, it's kind of pricy for the minamilistic extras and only 8 shows. Hopefully Universal will stop being so greedy, or at least give us something that warrants the cost."
2,Not very many episodes on DVD,"Love this show but when I bought this it was expensive and there are not that many episodes on this DVD. If you get it cheap OK but I wouldn't pay top dollar (whatever that is for you) for it. The music is differen't from the broadcast version, like many shows they could not get or did not want to pay for the ""clearances"" to use the songs from the original show."
3,Excellent Series....BUT...,"I loved this series. After watching the DVD set I still love it. However the DVD has issues..... First off its rediculously priced.. Second I think the jacket cover is great! Third - Was this dvd made in someones garage?? The disc are all mislabled Side 1 disc 1 is really side 2 disc 1 and so on for both discs. Whats even worse is that there is no episode list in the cd package anywhere, so you can get the episodes in order... BIG DUHHH Factor!Get it together you boneheads!Uh, by the way... WHEN THE HELL IS THE NEXT YEAR COMMING OUT?But I still love the series....."
3,Great but Overpriced,"The first season is only 8 episodes but the sell price is the same as other television season DVD's that contain 22 episodes. Good stuff, but VERY overpriced!"
5,FINALLY,"This is one of my favorite shows! I miss it very much, I never got to buy the VHS, but now it is on DVD at last (well in may it is anyhow :) The characters are all crazy, the setting is so peaceful, and begs to be disturbed by the characters.I can't wait to hear Chris Stevens muse over whatever he muses over in stereo surround on my dvd :)"
5,I am very pleased with this DVD set.,"Initially I was a little suspicious when learning that there were only 8 episodes in this first season release. However, I have viewed the extra ""unexposed"" footage and the deleted scenes and must say that they are very satisfactory. I have had no troubles with the media and the visual quality of the episodes is fine. The packaging is very unique, and really expresses the tone of the show nicely.If you are a casual fan then I would say that this collection is worth while due to the excellent quality of the episodes in the first season. For ""hard core"" fans, the bottom line is that this edition is a must have.Overall, I think that alot of work went into this release and it really shows in the packaged product."
3,"It's here, it's finally here, but............","Ok, the first big problem is that when you put in side one of the two sided disc in your DVD player, it plays side 2. On top of that, they don't number the episodes, so at first I thought the pilot episode might be released at some future time. I got up and flipped it, and got my pilot, and the first couple of episodes. It is great to see the old episodes, and in high quality DVD. I am upset that they don't have it in widescreen, so it is a pain b/c I have to take my DVD player out of progressive scan, and re-configure my TV to play the old and outdated 4:3, I mean, they did film it, so they should have been able to put it in widescreen. A little pricey for a no frills DVD. Cute jacket, though."
3,"Best show ever, bad DVD release","If you're a Northern fan, you can't not buy this. That said, the amount of work put into the production and packaging (aside from the cute parka) of this DVD is absolute minimal. No epsiode list?? Not even a sound track while viewing menus? AND I have to watch a preview?? I don't feel ripped off paying $40 for the first season only, as this is the best televison show ever created, but I do feel bad that Universal didn't put more of an effort into it. Cicely and her residents deserve better!"
1,too few of a great thing,Awesome show! I've been waiting for a re-release like this for so long - alas only 8 episodes for $60 (okay $42) at Amazon - this is simply put - stupid. At least include the 7 episodes from season 2.
4,Where's the pilot?,"Where's the pilot? I'm not talking about Janine Turner's (Maggie)character. But, what happened to the introductory episode when Joel thinks he is going to Anchorage and ends up in Cicely. Are we suppose to buy it in a separate package from Universal? Luckily I have most of the episodes on VHS, but I'm willing to shell out the money to get them all on DVD, especially the first three seasons, which were the high point to my tv viewing. Each episode was like watching an independent film nugget."
4,Fun,A relaxed and enjoyable series in an amazing part of the world. Easy watching and you gradually become part of the characters as the episodes unfold.
2,not happy,I am not happy with the Northern Exposure first season. I was happy to see it again but I was NOT happy that the musical sound track was not the original. If you have any with the original sound track I would be very interested in purchasing them.J. michell Lott
4,Welcome To Cicely,"Northern Exposure is a rare, truly original series. The show follows the experiences of transplanted New Yorker, Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow) in the Alaskan town of Cicely, where the citizens are some of the strangest people on earth. Joel is baffled by the quirks and oddities of locals and it doesn't get any better for him as he is bound for four years of indentured service as repayment for a loan to go to medical school. Despite the quirks, the people of Cicely are warm and caring people. Its that soft undertone that helps keep Northern Exposure from tipping over the edge of being just plain weird. The only drawback to the collection is that since the first season was a midseason replacement, it is a scant eight episodes. It would have been nice to see this and the second season packaged together."
4,Like not Love it,"I would get another season for the real querkiness I remember from this show. The first season has a lot of annoying compaining going on from Doctor Joel. The other seasons should have more character development in them, so it isn't all about him. I realize they had to show how he got there and how mad he was too. However, if you want to see the episode where Chris meets his brother, then get this one. It is one of my favorites!"
5,"Finally, the long awaited release is here...","For years, my wife and I have enjoyed watching reruns of this best TV series of all time (in our humble opinion) on various networks, but always wanted to see the series on DVD. Despite the intially high price, it is great that the series is finally being released. I ordered this for $55 CDN on Amazon.ca, but then immediately cancelled the order and reordered the next day when the price had dropped to less than half the price. Hopefully the remaining seasons will be releases soon with similarly low prices. We cannot wait to have the complete collection on DVD."
2,Expected more!,"There's no arguement here that Northern Exposure was one of the most original shows on TV. I just wish that the production of this DVD set was up to those standards. No linar notes, poorly labeled two-sided DVD (with only TWO shows per side--give me a break!). No extras except a few deleted scenes.How about a booklet? How about a listing of songs (one of the great things about this show was the amazing use of little known and popular songs that advanced the plot)? How about interviews? Credits? Filmographies? Etc, etc, etc.Next time, skip the cute package parka and give us some worthwhile extras on the DVD's--you're charging top dollar! Customers expect more these days."
3,A NE fan,"This is my first customer review ever, although I read them all the time. First, I love this show and pre-ordered it months ago. I agree about the price and I would trade the parka for a simple episode list (maybe even a brief synopsis) in a second.However, my big problem is that I returned one set of disks to Amazon because the disk simply hung up in the middle of the Aurora Borealis episode. I have received a replacement and it stops in the same place in the same episode. I find it hard to believe I am the only person who has had this problem. I guess I'll wait to reorder until they work the bugs out. Defective disks anyone?"
3,poor treatment for such a fantastic show,"just my $0.02 worth...first off i sincerely hope that the suggestions made here in these pages actually reach the folks who are in charge of Universal.some real problems i have with the the treatment:flipper (2-sided) DVD'sconfusing labeling as to which side is which on the disc itselfnothing in the way of numbering each episode...no episode summaries, original air dates, written/directed by...i didn't exactly expect commentary, but it would have been a nice extra.the menus are not user-friendly, in my opinion. after watching an episode, it takes you to the deleted scenes menu, instead of the episode menu. no biggie, but its a bit like going around the elbow to get to the arse.the parka is a nice novelty. but it's just that: fluff.i hope they do the succeeding seasons justice. it's a shame they did such a slip-shod job on the first one."
5,Greatest Television Show Ever!!!,"It's about time this is coming to DVD! This great show takes place in Cicely, Alaska. The story lines are original and each character is unique. This is a must own DVD!!"
3,Is it worth the price?,"Yes and no.If you are a diehard fan, obviously it is worth it. The packaging is fantastic (probably where most of the cost comes from) and the extras are interesting, though not particularly compelling.However, if you enjoyed the series and are considering purchasing some but not all of the episodes, wait until the third season is released. While the show is great from the beginning, it didn't really hit its stride until the third (and first full-length) season.I hate to dissuade people from purchasing this set, but it's just not worth the price for eight episodes."
2,Could be better.,Universal should have put more into the contents as they did in the packaging! The disc are double sided with two episodes on each side.Also the menu screen comes up with no intro! Its great for fans but also a real disapointment.
3,DVD wasn't like new,"I have ordered many things from Amazon and have been extremely pleased with both the product and the prices. When I ordered a Used-Like New DVD of Northern Exposure Season 1 I fully expected it to be A-OK. Much to my surprise, one of the Episodes froze while we were watching it and we were undable to continue.Upon inspection we could see where it had been scratched. This is the first bad experience I've had but I will continue to buy through Amazon, even though I was disappointed this time around."
5,Northern Exposure,"The video was sent promptly, was securely packed, and in great condition. My friend that I purcahsed it for loved it."
1,Greed,"This was my wife's favorite TV show, so I was eager to pick this up. But 8 episodes for $41.99?! While Northern Exposure is a wonderful show, that price is absurd. A quick per-episode comparison with other great shows, based on Amazon prices at the time of this writing:$5.25/episdoe for Season 1 of Northern Exposure (8 episodes)$3.82/episode for Seasons 1 and 2 of Homicide (13 episodes)$2.06/episode for Season 1 of The West Wing (22 episodes)$1.87/episode for Season 1 of 24 (24 episodes, of course)If nothing else Northern Exposure should have Seasons 1 and 2 bundled a la Homicide. It disappoints me to say this, but I can't bring myself to buy at these rates. I hope the studio will reconsider how the series is marketed. They are of course free to ask whatever price they want, but I hope they won't be rewarded for the price they've chosen."
1,Defective,"I strongly recommend that you NOT spend your money on this DVD. The entire second disk that I received is defective. It is clearly a problem with the disk itself, entire parts of the content are inaccessible and the problem always occurs towards the end of program sections. After reading reviews of later seasons of Northern Exposure, I see that this is a known issue.Northern Exposure is great...that's why I bough the DVD. Amazon is very convenient...that's why I give them hundreds of dollars a year. But this product is defective."
1,"5 Star Show, 1 Star Price","I have been waiting forever for this brilliant show to come to DVD. However, the amount Universal is asking for this season is disgusting. Many other TV shows release entire seasons of shows with 22 to 24 episodes for the same price or only slightly more. This set contains a mere eight episodes. Why couldn't they have combined this set with the second season (which was only seven episodes long), the way the first two seasons of Homicide were combined?I will hold off on buying this until I see a price drop or some sort of sale. Unfortunately, that high price will keep sales low, and as a result we may never see the later seasons on DVD - a horrible thought, but I'm not going to support the greed that went into the production of this DVD."
2,"Great Show, but...","Okay I have been looking forword to being able to return to Northern Exposure for a long Time. I was never able to watch the show when it originaly aired (probably because I was 4 or 5 when it came out), but my mother watched it so when i saw it on Hallmark I chekced it out. Evne though i only watched about 10 episodes before it was pulled I feel in love with the characters and the town.But Universal has made a major mistake. Other Studios (Fox, Warner Brothers, Columbia) are releasing Season sets with 20 to 30 episodes at 60 dollars a piece (at most stores 40), but Universal is planning on giving us 8 episodes at the same price! Thats a Little expensive. If it had been the complete First and Second Season it would be another story, but its not. Bad judgement called on Universals part.But for most It might be worth the extra price to return to quirkiest town this side of Stars Hallow."
5,This DVD is worth the money,"You can pay $19.00 for garbage on DVD anytime. Yes, $42.00 for 8 episodes is steeper than some other things out there, but quality costs.If Season 1 doesn't sell they may not release Season 2 and that would be a shame. I personally want the entire series on DVD, and am willing to pay a little more for the best series ever on television.This First Series DVD (got mine last Friday) is better than most of the 2-3 hour motion picture DVDs out there.Excellent, intact, and worth the purchase."
4,Flip the Disc Over !!!,"Yes it's true the first season is only 8 episodes long ( I wish they had put 3 seasons on one disc) , however, do you know how long true NX fans have been waiting for this ? We've had to sit and watch all the other crummy shows with low level talent be placed into the digital realm while we wear our VHS tapes out ..... All that being said .....Yes the extras are a little thin, yes there is no episode guide inside the case....but the impact of this show far outweighs the little extras that we have been so accustomed to. Quality does not mean quantity. Oh and by the way, the pilot is on the other side of the disc....Flip it over...and enjoy."
5,Happy Enough To Fling A Piano,"It has been a long time coming but the first season is finally here in DVD. My VHS tapes are falling apart, they couldn't have come at a better time. I agree that the cost is rather excessive...but...I don't want to wait another 9 or 10 years till they decide to put these excellent episodes on DVD format. I will probably be more than willing to shell out the cash to get these DVDs as the are released. In my 30+ years of television viewing this has to be one of the best programs ever to grace the small screen. Hopefully they will release the whole cosmic enchilada and I won't be short a season when I'm done collecting. Time has done justice to this show. It seems to appeal to me more as the years go by. It is a shame it only lasted a few years. Big things come in small packages I guess. As Marilyn would say, ""Yes!"""
4,Great despite the flaws,"I agree completely with some others who have written reviews that 8 episodes is weak. They could have learned a lesson from Homicide: Life on the Street, who released a combined DVD package of the first two seasons. Additionally, I find the deleted scenes entirely useless. TV shows need to be edited for time through a natural process because of the format, unlike in film, in which the artistic decisions are more of a factor in deciding what stays and what goes (or so one would hope.) The strength of this DVD collection is simply that the original show was so terrific, groundbreaking, smart, and funny. The show is the star of this DVD package, not the packaging and 'extras.'"
4,"Alas, Alas","While the quality of the show is outstanding, I have two bones to pick with those that produced it. First, they mislabeled disc one, the side labeled ""Disc One, Side One"" is actually ""Disc One, Side Two."" This caused us to watch it out of order. The second is the advertising that it is the ""Complete First Season,"" and while this is technically true, no where on the packaging (either exterior of interior) does it state that there were only 8 episodes on the first season. So, to have paid full retail price for only 8 episodes seems unfair(I bought The West Wing, Season 2, at the same time, at the same price as NX, and The West Wing had more than 14 episodes on it, and they didn't go the cheap way of bundling everying on the front and back of the discs.While I love this show, the goofy packaging doesn't make up for the fact that I feel ripped off.Michael Patterson"
4,I can finally put my old VHS tapes away.,"Yes this is only 8 episodes, and yes it's overpriced, but when a show the caliber of ""Northern Exposure"" comes out on DVD, you've got to cough up the cash. In a world with so much ""reality"" tv, it's nice to see all these unique characters interact in an environment that's probably closer to our own reality, or what some of us wish it was. Obviously this is great to see again, and it will take you right back to watching it the first time. The extras aren't too amazing, but between the deleted scenes, the outtakes, and the original episodes, you've got more than 6 hours of viewing. By the time it's over, you'll feel like you've been sitting in ""The Brick""."
1,WHAT THE HECK????,"OK, I love the show, so why only a one star review? The first season of Northern exposure was only eight episodes, so that is what you get in this package, eight episodes. The second season was only seven episodes, so if Universal decides to release the second season, it will be even shorter, at probably the same price point, which is unacceptable. Why they didn't release seasons 1 and 2 in one package for $40.00, (which is a much more reasonable price for 15 episodes) is a mystery. Wait, I solved the mystery. Greed."
1,NX Fans aren't fools!!,I have been avidly waiting for NX to be released on DVD and this is what we get!! $60 for 8 messly episodes! What is Universal playing at here? with every bad sitcom under the sun being released on DVD they take in excess of 10 years to make this show available en masse to its fans and now they are trying to bend us over and screw us royaly. Who knows how much they are going to charge for Season 3 which actually contains 22 episodes. All of us NX fans need to band together and protest loudly and proudly to Universal that the market for this show is out there but we aint a bunch of punks!!
1,Northern Exposure INCOMPLETE For Any Season,"The Northern Exposure DVDs feature only four episodes per disc. At two discs, two episodes per, that's eight episodes out of thirteen. The First Season does NOT include the pilot.VERY disappointing."
3,A great series that deserves better,"The producers of the DVD really need to do better by this series and its fans in putting together the sets for later seasons. It wouldn't have taken too much more effort to make this a decent set: put the episodes in order, provide a brief booklet, and use single-sided discs. I don't mind paying a premium for the eight episodes, but am very disappointed at the lack of attention to the details that matter when you're viewing the shows. The parka was a nice packaging touch, but it's what's inside that counts!"
1,Great Show but Terrible DVD,"OK, the 1 star is not because I don't like Northern Exposure. On the contrary. The one star is for the pathetic organization of this DVD.Not only is this DVD too overpriced for 8 episodes (give me a break!)It is incoherently organized on two sides of each DVD, which are not clearly marked.I was willing to overpay for the DVD. But aren't we, the fans, entitled to a quality DVD in exchange?"
1,Don't complain - abstain!,"People, people . . . It's absolutely no use complaining about how high the price of this set of DVDs is. You can't say, ""I bought it, but I'm unhappy about it."" The company already has your money, and they won't change their pricing based on your expressed unhappiness -- what they learn from the transaction is that you *are* willing to pay their price. If you really think the price of this set is too high (as I do), you've got to grit your teeth and NOT BUY IT! That's the only thing that will genuinely signal to the company that you aren't willing to meet their price. Six or seven bucks an episode? It's crazy. Release a combined set of seasons 1 and 2 for this price, and we can talk."
2,"Only 2 Stars, and this is why:","First, let me say that I LOVE this show. I never missed an episode when it was on television. I give this 2 stars because of other issues abound.The price is completely whacked considering this show is a decade old, there are only 2 discs with eight episodes (yes, I know there were only 8 the first season, but hence my reason for complaining about the price!!!), the lack of extra features for such a series, AND....the thing that REALLY ticked me off....it seems that since they are charging an exhorbitant price for this set, they COULD have paid someone with a brain to arrange the episodes in PROPER order on the discs!!!! (The pilot episode is on SIDE 2 of the first disc!!!!) What a shame. Universal should tuck their head between their legs for such a marketing disaster!!!"
1,Baby Superstar videos are really terrible.,"At first, I was excited to see new infant products, since my kids love the Baby Einstein series so much that they've seen them a million times. I ordered all the Baby Superstar products and now, I'm going to return them. They are really, really bad videos. I don't know if these guys are just trying to sell toys or what, but these videos are BORING and CHEAP-looking. Also my kids hate them. I tried to give them to my sister-in-law but her kids hate them too. They don't hold children's attention - kids know when something is bad. No one should buy these terrible products. I've never written a review before, but these videos are so bad that I felt like I had to."
1,Awful video.,"I don't know what the other people writing these complimentary reviews are thinking. These videos are AWFUL. They are shoddy, cheap, and insulting to children. Even worse is the parents' guide on the DVDs. It is condescending and phony. My kids have no interest in the video. I showed it to the other parents in my parenting group, and they all agreed with my assessment. Maybe a very listless, slow child would like this video, but for normal, and especially above-average children, it is truly awful."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this video thinking my son would like it as much as he likes Baby Bach and Baby Mozart (which he's been watching avidly since he was 2 monthes old). I popped it in and he could have cared less. He's watch Baby Mozart for two hours if I'd let him, but this video couldn't hold his attention for two minutes.He first watched it at 5 monthes, so I though perhaps it was his age, but I pulled it out at 7 and 9 monthes and again, he could care less."
3,Braun 4 - cup carafe,"Item was as expected, shipping was quick and packing was well done. *Only negative they have not fixed the plasic nubs that rotates open the carafe lid and breaks off over a period of time, it is a definite design problem, as this is my third carafe, the prior two had the same problem."
5,Excellent book,"This book is not a quick read, but is definitely worth the time to dig out the rich morsels. Mr Otis has done so much of the hard work & research & compiled a very informative book that answers so many questions while presenting even more. Very thought provoking. I highly respect that the information is presented in a very factual & balanced way, and he doesn't mince words where the Word of God speaks on these topics. His faith is very evident, but there is room for the individual reader to seek the Lord for themselves & draw their own conclusions as the Lord personally leads them.""The Twilight Labyrinth"" has brought a great deal of confirmation to issues that the Lord was already speaking to me on. Thank you Mr Otis for sharing your lifes work so that other intercessors can also join in the battle to see the kingdom of darkness bend the knee to the Kingdom of Light as scripture tells us that ""at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow in heaven and on earth"""
4,This is a deep book,"This book is very deep and touches a lot of deep subjects including witchcraft, quantum mechanics, phycology, paranormal/supernatural, and much more.The sentences tend to ramble on and on; For example, this is typical of the sentences used in this book, ""Even if we agree that demonic forces attain their initial entree into communities through the misplaced choices of earlier generations, we need to discover how these powers manage to secure lease extensions centuries after their original business partners are dead and buried."" Unless you are well studied in the subjects touched, you will have to read and re-read the sentences to understand all he is saying.In spite of the rambling, I was able to gleen plenty from the book and I would recommend it. For me, this interesting book brought together many subjects I've pondered."
5,Opening the lid...,"This is a great book for opening the lid on a lot of what goes on around us. It is a good, solid, hype-free but passionate expose of the dark spiritual world. I bought it to make sense of the battle going on around my family in Japan and found the principles really helpful. Not only that but the Sentinel Trust have since been very willing to give assistance in out situation, just use the email from the website, not the book!"
5,Explaining in depth Realities of Evil,"There is another realm that is opposed to The Light"" And many that seek power from non righteous means. This cultivates and maintains darkness and It lingers . This book gives an indepth research that leads one rationalize and yet understanding .....may deceive you of that were possible."
3,"Great band, good album","April Wine is a band that many have forgotten, but they made great rock and it was fun for parties in the 80s and you will enjoy it."
4,April Wine at their best,"""Harder/Faster"" and ""Nature of the Beast"" are the two indispensable works of Canadian import April Wine. They had a penchant for highly infectious, straight ahead rock n' roll. No filler on this one. A classic."
3,April wine just a memory,Typical studio rock late 70's early 80's had the vinyl in youth just had to get cd good but not great
5,great gift,"Bought this for my grandson who loves the turtles! He was very excited when I gave it to him. This item was priced great, fast delivery, no problems."
2,WEAK,"A two star rating is being generous. DVD's are meant to be something special. The special portion of this DVD is the pilot episode of ""Tales of Frankenstein"". The disc is filled with trailers and and the novel of the classic itself for your DVD-ROM. The menu screen started the trouble with the highlighted selection being hard to determine. The trailers seem to be from a bad source and do not flow within the DVD. The video interviews are cut short as they begin to get interesting, I have yet to sit down and listen to the audio interviews. Overall the production value of the disc is quite poor and the art for the cover and the insert looks as if it was done in two seconds. After releasing a nice hidden classic such as ""The Asphyx"", ALL DAY ENTERTAINMENT needs to take lessons from Anchor Bay in quality for your buck. For die hard collectors of horror only..."
2,Hits and misses,"It is nice that this release has a few treasures to offset what is more or less a messy presentation. The treasures are: a couple of nice bloopers featuring A&C and Lugosi, The complete pilot for Tales of Frankenstein, and some interview footage that I've seen around before( they cut most of this footage short at very odd places- who made this decision and why?). There are a whole bunch of trailers-the b/w ones are almost always dupy and/or re-issues. A few are enjoyable. The infamous Lon Chaney jr. episode of Tales of Tommorrow is here in a condensed version- sad and interesting."
2,Not every good,"I thought TALES OF FRANKENSTEIN was a not a very good movie. The storyline is not very exciting. The actor of Frankenstein's monster is bad. Dr. Frankenstein himself is a boring one, compared to Colin Clive or Peter Cushing. I thought the make-up for the monster was good but he did not seen as human as Boris Karloff. I did not like the music or the introduction which has clips from other movies like Murders in the Rue Morgue, Dracula and The Raven. I would much rather watch the original Frankenstein or another Horror film."
2,A Missed Opportunity,"This is a fun collection, but a terrible DVD. The video condition is pathetic, the menu is to difficult to navigate and the sound is murky. I did enjoy the audio commentary during ""Tales of Frankenstein"" and the audio interviews with Boris Karloff and Glen Strange.I was really looking forward to this DVD and its sister production, ""The Horror of Hammer."" I will be holding off purchasing HofH until I read a few positive counsumer reviews."
3,Alpha Double Feature,"The main attraction on this Alpha double feature is the tv pilot Tales of Frankenstein. A 25 minute episode filmed for television, it is a really condensed horror movie. Don't expect too much for the time allotted. It is a fun watch and it would have been neat to see what the show could have done if it was picked up and more episodes were filmed. Pretty good quality for this feature. The price is right since you get The Terror as a bonus!"
2,Proving Once Again that MTV has no ...,"The only reason this doesn't get just one star is because there are actually some good videos on this DVD. Now for the 2 stars ....To the point: this DVD is censored. The audio is censored in the same places as on TV, as is the video. Why? It's a DVD for cryin' out loud!! It's not susceptible to the regulations of the communist FCC like TRL and all the other ... on TV. Instead of providing the so-called masses with a pure, untarnished DVD with uncut audio and video, they release this ... with the same lame editing as you'd find on eMpTyV. I know they have an MTV20 Jams DVD as well; it's probably just one long beep with completely blurred out video. God, how much ... are the masses gonna let MTV feed them until they get out of this brain-washed state and demand quality??"
2,Poor Writing...,I bought this based on all the good reviews and the plot. I couldn't get through it because of the poor writing.
5,...and Justice shall prevail,;Another favorite. Revenge and justice go hand in hand. Jones is great as the determined and persistent yet fair detective. Ashley Judd gives a truly great performance as the wife accused of murdering a husband that actually is still alive.
5,great item,"I love the one I have. It is a great product. I am a bit worried of chipping it or having it crack. The first time it was shipped, it was busted upon deliver and refused the package."
2,Not at all like picture,"Shorter, shiny black with beige interior. I should have read the other reviews before ordering. Not even close."
4,"Black is gloss, not satin","Crock is beautiful and holds a lot, but the color is not a matte black as the photo shows, it was a gloss black and i was a little disappointed with that. Otherwise a good product, very heavy so it doesn't move around!"
5,5 Stars,I would just like to say my baby had her eyes glued to the TV screen watching the Forest Ranger DVD. She loves the different animals in the forest and I like the fact that she enjoys the video so much. I have recommended this video to all my friends with an age appropriate child and I give it 5 stars.
1,"Baby Superstar is based on bad, oudated research.","As a child psychologist, I felt that I had to write in about the Baby Superstar dvds. These dvds are shockingly irresponsible. The ""science"" that they are based on is outdated, and isn't at all in line with what we in the child psychology and educational communities have been researching over the past five years. These videos are clearly not based on current, peer-reviewed research. The parenting tips on the dvds are also surprisingly out of date, and the ""experts"" that appear or are referenced are not considered knowledgeable or relevant by the scientific, research, or educational communities. I would not play these dvds for my own children, and I will advise the parents in my practice that these dvds are not suitable or productive for their children."
1,This is NO Baby Einstein!,"I was led to believe that this video was one of the Baby Einstein series, but boy was I wrong! The minute I put the DVD in the player, it was obvious that this was not of the same quality. Unlike the superb Baby Einstein videos, the Baby Superstar videos are slow and cheap-looking. Also, the company is clearly trying to piggy-back onto the popularity of the excellent Baby Einstein video series. I am writing this review so that others won't be fooled into buying these lousy videos. Spend your money on Baby Einstein instead."
1,Not appropriate for children.,"I concur with Dr. Nelson, who has already written a review. As a medical doctor, a PhD in Developmental Psychology, and a mother, I find it sad that this is the sort of pap that is being fed to children too young to make their preferences known. Infants need stimulation, interaction, and challenges. They do not need to be plopped in front of the television to watch substandard material based on outdated, junky science. The myth of the ""Mozart Syndrome,"" the nonsense about cheap toys and reality footage, the substandard parenting ""guide,"" - this is pop, irresponsible science at its worst. I would not recommend these videos to any parent interested in raising an alert, bright child."
4,A Classic Performance,"Dating from the 1950s, this performance is one of the first complete recordings of a Handel opera--and one of the first with most of the voices in their original register. Although it not what we would now call an historically informed performance, it features some of the best baroque specialists of its era, and it wears its years lightly. Gramophone's reviewer considers it superior to the more recent recording by Somary on Newport.Another option is the recent recording of Handel's Fernando, conducted by Alan Curtis, on Virgin Classics. Fernando is Handel's first draft of Sosarme--the words and music are essentially the same, but the names and places are changed. For example, Fernando, king of Castille (an historical figure), is turned into Sosarme, king of Media (ancient Persia), to avoid offending King George II. The Curtis recording is a period performance in modern sound, but Lewis's pioneering effort still has much to recommend it.Paul N. Van de Water"
4,Cool Gift,This necklace was given to me as a gift for Christmas and is really cool. I like the fact that it was made by someone who took care and time to make it look beautiful. I also like the fact that it came with a hand written thank you on a postcard from the person who made.
5,Great Assos Clothes Cleaner,I ordered a couple of bottles of Assos Cleaner and have really noticed the difference between my regular laundry soap and this cleaner. Assos seams to have found a cleaner that works perfectly for sweaty bike clothes and any active sports clothes I have used it on. Great Stuff!!Try it you will like it. Price is quite steep but the product speaks for itself. The seller was great and I received them very fast!!!
3,"Decent reference, but somewhat dated.","In perusing the book, I found it to be somewhat of a dissapointment. Technologies and terminologies which were present during its publication are not listed (snp's, est's). In addition, other terms I find are innapropriate for the book which, regardless of a persons background, should be obvious (dissatisfaction, five-line address, Netscape Navigator). Hopefully a revised/expanded edition is planned for 2000/01."
3,"I like it, but not a true organic product","I tried a sample of this and really liked the way it felt on my skin. With the name, ""organic therapy"", I wondered if the product was certified organic. Coming to amazon to check it out, I noticed in the ingredients that there were artificial dyes and a paraben (Propylparaben) listed. When I went to the Palmers website it says that it uses organic extra virgin olive oil, which does not mean the product itself is organic. Just be aware that you are using a product that is not 100% organic and contains some potentially harmful things in it."
1,The few OK songs are trashed,"It sounded interesting with the different ""famous"" cover songs, but they are poorly done. A couple were hopeful, but midway were ruined in some way. Actually, the only decent song is an Abba cover."
4,How good is this? Depends on what you're looking for,"If you are expecting something similar to Paul Oakenfold or DJ Irene, look elsewhere. This a mostly sedentary work, consisting largely of vocal washes imposed over moderate beats; in other words, it lacks the drive and rhythm of most trance-oriented works, but it does retain the genre's style and sensibilities, albeit at a much reduced pace. If anything, it resembles the efforts of Enya more than it does trance. This isn't music to dance to; rather, it is best suited as background or as accompaniment for activities such as reading or crafts. As a trance album, this may disappoint fans of that musical type. But for those seeking a good tonic for relaxation or sedentary activities, this will work just fine."
3,"you might fall into a ""trance"", involuntarily","I had higher hopes for this CD, which I also gave as a gift to a friend. Though it starts out in an interestingly musical fashion, not much else happens after the initial intro piece. The album sounds too much alike from beginning to end, as if it were one long track, instead of several like it is indexed. Maybe Diane Arkenstone was inspired by Brian Eno's method of looping the same segment of music over and over again. It doesn't work here for what she's trying to market as a multi-song album. She should have issued this album as a six-track EP, or included a greater variety of ""trancescapes"" like you'd find on an Enigma or Enya recording.Not a terrible release, but not worth the list price either."
3,Ok,"I love Diane Arkenstone. Jewel in the Sun and The Healing Spirit are beautiful, intriguing and different. This one, however, is ""Okay"". It's okay for background music. It tries a little too hard. She appears to be experimenting with electronic equipment. I Love Enigma, and that's what this seems to have a lot of. It seems to be heavily evoking Enigma-like elements. If you have to choose, buy her other works. This one has a few moments of really good stuff. But mostly is trying too hard to be something it isn't."
2,One track describes the whole CD,"I had listened to samples from this CD before I bought it and had high hopes it was in the realm of Enigma. Well it does touch down with Enigma like sounds occasionally, but that unfortunately does not make up for this rather boring CD. If you listen to the first track, you have listened to the whole CD. There is very little variance among the tracks in tempo and sound. If your looking for background music this may suffice, but not worth the 14 bucks."
2,"Surprisingly boring, even a little silly","I was eager for this CD, considering how much I love Jewel in the Sun, and the Healing Spirit. But something is very wrong here, and I feel I wasted my money. I actually burst out laughing when I heard her saying ""I am the voice of the sea"". I could have done better myself, which is no compliment. There are a lot better CD's out there than this one."
3,shot to the heart.....................,"....and your to blame, this movie gives love, A BAD NAME!I think if this movie would have focused more on the trial of the date rape incident, it would have been more compelling. Instead it kept going backwards and showcasing siloquies of the actors and their thoughts about rape. I was actually complelled at one point in the film pondering who was actually telling the truth about the rape incident. Was he telling the truth or was she telling the truth? I thought we would find out at the end in a dramtic finale courtroom spectacle. The ending of the film absolutely had me miffed. The conclusion was so abrupt and depressing. Bad move."
2,too much commotion i guess,"this movie was preatty awful... i guess the acting was preatty good and i luv tara reid BR>but it highly lacked in plot and the ending was positively awful! there really was no end... no ending to no story, i guess thats the only part that makes real sense... oh god... don't even bother."
2,what were they going for?,"this movie has alot of problems. First of all it doesn'tknow what it is. A drama, comedy, sort of mystery or post teen comedy. Either way it is pretty bad and while it can hold your attention the end result isn't worth it. The only thing that saves it is tha amzing cast of talented actors who are trying as hard as they can to make something out of nothing. 2 stars for the cast"
1,Stupifyingly Bad.,"This movie is pretty brutal. Irritating characters talk to the camera and tell you the laws of dating as if they could maintain a relationship for more than Mardi Gras weekend. At one point a character says ""Sex without love equals violence."" No, this movie without alcohol equals violence.A group of guys including Jerry O'Connell (I liked him better when he was the fat kid), head out to hook-up with some fly honeys, yo. But that's all whack, yo. Ahem. Obnoxious, isn't it. Jerry goes home with Tara Reid and they have sex. Or was it [violation]? There is a lot of other sex, but the story seems to focus...actually it doesn't focus at all. It's just a series of vignettes. ... I like Tara Reid when she's herself, but she's played so many unlikable characters I'm beginning dislike her. Ditto for Amanda Peet.Highest recommendation to avoid. If you need dating tips, try [someone else]."
3,A film that nicely explores sex in the late nineties,"Body Shots is a film that should have been promoted more and seen by more people. The film has sharp dialouge, smooth wit and Tara Reid nude. David McKenna has written another good script which is his follow up to Amercian History X and the cast of up and comers are all good. Ron Livingston as Trent makes the movie as Trent with his one-liners and further more we get to see Tara Reid show her goods."
4,Exploring modern sex issues and its consequences,"The current twenty-something generation's sexual culture is explored in this film in a way that reveals the relational highs and lows of dating culture and the consequences of sexual activity in the night club context. I loved the conversations that I have had with friends when we have watched this movie. It helps lift some of the taboos and allowed for frank sexual discussion. It is also a wonderfully shot movie. Every scene is well planned. Unfortunately, one of the less strong strands of the story becomes the focus, and the real loving relationship is lost in its aftermath."
3,Body Shots,"Thumb's up on the character set-up and how the plot is lyed out, But thumb's down on plot.The plot is lyed out where they show you the climax first than go back and show you what lead up to it and beyond"
5,My New Favourite Movie,"i rented this movie the day it came out on video.. i know the movie flopped in theatres, but that may just be because the reviewers are old and not in tune with the younger generation.. i'm 21, and i found this movie very truthful.. alot of what was going on in the movie IS happening in real life.. the dialogue they used was also very acurate.. i loved it.. plain & simple.."
1,Too Many Shots,"In a way I found ""Body Shots"" to be a little insulting. The way that the male and female characters are written it's like they're a disgrace to mankind. All they talk about throughout the film is sex. I mean it has your typical male (which by the way, not all men are like this): wanting it, fantasizng about it, then getting it, and then bragging to your friends. From all that sex talk, which gets really annoying, you have a rape issue going on.Overall, ""Body Shots"" is really uneven and way too much for one to watch."
3,Cute but...,"The diary cover was very cute...but the lock came broken. Although it was fixable...it should have either been made of better quality or wrapped better when it was shipped. It stinks to have to fix a gift before you give it! However, since she is a ""HELLO KITTY"" collector, I'm sure my niece will love it!"
5,Unusually effective techniques to improve kids' behaviors,"I saw the authors on Oprah Winfrey and then read the book. It has been a big help to my family. We( parents) yell less, the kids follow directions better, and our youngest child no longer has tantrums. The authors present specific ""how to "" techniques for helping parents teach children to follow directions, end lying, improve motivation and school performance, and how parents can enhance ther own communication with each other. The best parenting book my wife and I have seen. Also has very amusing examples and a great parneting quiz"
1,I agree with Jennifer Kern,"She is absolutely right about the limited scope of this book. Look at the title -- it presumes there is such thing as ""Jewish"" interfaith family life. (Any book or class with only one faith listed in the title should be an immediate tip-off for people hoping to find a broad view of a very complex topic)I'm a Catholic with two Catholic children married to an observant Jew. We keep a kosher home and celebrate both sets of holidays. We go to church and synagogue regularly. Sadly, there is absolutley nothing useful in this book for my family since I (and my kids) are not planning to convert."
5,Excellent Guide - Great Source of Information,"Being in an interfaith relationship myself, I was looking for a book that could help us figure out where to start and how others have dealt with many of the issues we are facing. Jewish Interfaith Family Life has proved to be a great source of information as well as a conversation starter about how we plan to raise our children, how we deal with our families and how we can make our relationship work in light of our religious differences. This book shows you that you are not alone and provides you with insights into how others have dealt with bringing Judism into an interfaith home. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is in an interfaith relationship, is a parent or family member of an interfaith couple or knows someone who is working out the challenges of an interfaith relationship."
4,As a contributing author...,"I contributed an article to this book about my boyfriend's upcoming conversion to Judaism. Though my chapter represents a different, more traditional, view than that of most interfaith authors, it's a tribute to the JFL editors that it was included in this collection.I haven't received my complimentary copy of the book yet, but I will update this review as soon as I have had a chance to peruse other writers' contributions and the collection as a whole. In the meantime, just knowing first-hand the diversity and quality of the pieces selected, I am happy to recommend this book with confidence."
4,Served it's purpose,I had a printer which I wanted to move to the other side of the room away from my desk (approx 8 feet away) this cable did the trick
3,"Fun, yet complicated","This book is fun to look through, yet complicated to follow for a beginning artist. I was disappointed to see that there is only one picture of the Titanic to draw. Pictures included Capt. Smith, first class man and woman, a few fish, and the Carpathia."
1,Not Much Imformation and no new or good facts!,"I was excited avout getting this book from a school book order but I was very disapointed with how the book presents itself . There was no or very little imformation on the Titanic and there was only 1 pitcure to draw about the Titanic. It's a shame the books steps for drawing aren't very good and the text has no titanic imformation ,I'm a huge Titanic book who knows almost all of the ship and some of the imformation was wrong too."
3,limited pictures,"The title is misleading as there is ONLY ONE picture showing how to draw the Titanic. It does show other ships and items to draw and the title should be changed to reflect that. The book arrived in good shape and had a crease across the top right corner, but nothing that took away from the book."
1,"HIGH PRICED, POOR QUALITY","This item cost 8.95 to buy, plus we paid about $10 shipping to Hawaii. The quality of the item is poor, it is full of snags and frays after just a few months of use. Also, most items do not cost this exhorbitant amount to ship, even to Hawaii."
4,Referee jersey,Very comfortable and enjoyable for the circumstances of rearing my children everyone thought it was quite the hoot with my family and friends
4,runs a little small,"Order one size up. It was tighter than I thought it would be and had to re-order. I used it for game night with our teen group, and it served the purpose well. It would be fair to use for real sports. Not very breathable."
2,X-large is not a X-Large,I normally wear large to X-large on my shirts and since this shirt needed to be comfortable I ordered the X-Large. The shirt was well priced and it seemed well made. Upon trying it on though it was uncomfortably tight across the shoulders and arms. It had good torso length and was a good looking shirt. A shirt used for refereeing needs to have room for movement across the back and shoulders. Unfortunately this shirt did not. Returned for refund. Will keep looking.
5,Ref shirt,"This referee shirt saved my (job) several times when my others were in the wash! A very high quality shirt, comfortable and big enough for my frame."
5,Men's Referee Shirt...Great Purchase!,"The item was received on time and looks great on the guy, as well. I'd definitely recommend this item to a friend in need."
5,"Travel, people, and martial arts - good stuff!","For those beginning to learn about the martial arts or whowant to expand their horizons a bit, there are three booksyou must read: Moving Zen (C.W.Nicol), Autumn Lightning(Dave Lowry), and Iron and Silk (Mark Salzman). Iron and Silkis a solidly written tale of Salzman's journey to China. Itdetails both the physical and mental/spiritual aspects ofhis journey, and explores not just what but why. I preferbooks that engage me rather than just tell me, books thatmake me feel I am participating rather than receiving. Ironand Silk is such a book."
2,This book was boring in some parts and some were good,I didn't think this book was that great because all he talks about is what he acomplished and everything always turns out good for him. There are no parts in the book where he doesn't acomplish something that he wants to do. Also I thought it was kind of boring the only parts in the book that I like is when he is practiceing his wushu.
4,Experience China and Kung Fu through the author's eyes!,"This book is a joy to read, especially for those with a passion for Chinese martial arts! Each of his experiences with his various Kung Fu teachers and all of his Chinese friends, give westerners a glimpse of East meets West! Of course, Master Pan steals the show, and after reading the book, be sure to watch the movie by the same title, and features both Mark and Master Pan!"
4,How could you let such a racist review appear?,"On my original note, I think Mark Salzman wrote a very charming and entertaining book. He shows the Chinese culture from his point of view and shows the humor both sides encounter. I would recommend anyone who is interested in visiting China to read this book first and then reread it after to compare notes"
5,Dare to do. Dare to Dream.,"Iron and Silk remarkably captures the tension that exists between Eastern and Western society while portraying the heart in human interaction. Iron and Silk takes you to the center of the Chinease culture, but still retains the subtle perspective of an outsider It is a journey of strength and great courage that quietly compells the reader to open their own hearts and dare to question and to dream. This book was an incredible inspiration for me that I will carry inside forever."
4,"Charming summer reading, light and entertaining","A highly enjoyable ""tour"" of China and the Chinese with an overachieving Yalie working as an English teacher. Salzman's better adventures cast him not as a teacher but as a _student_, as renowned masters of calligraphy and martial arts in remote Hunan Province seek out the Westerner to add him to their list of proteges. Salzman's writing is deft and understated, if a trifle meatless and disjunct at times. Although there's some food for thought, it's more like a travelogue. But you'll smile many times in the course of this book and, if you're like me, you won't want it to end."
4,Poignant accounts,"For a couple of years the early 1980s, Mark Salzman was an English teacher and a martial arts master who went to a poor city in China to teach English. Salzman recalls his many episodes and adventures there with vignettes in his book Iron and Silk. He reveals much about the contrast of the Chinese culture from western culture.The poverty in this region of China struck me with surprise. Some of the places Saltzman describes as living conditions seem medival for the 1980's. I was also touched by the politeness and respect shown to Salzman, a white man, by the inhabitants of China. Americans could certainly use a few pointers from the Chinese. Overall, the poignant accounts in Iron and Silk will stay with the reader."
4,Great Novel,"This book is great for Americans to read before going to China. It tells us of the author's experience in a comical way that makes it easy to understand him. It also talks a lot about martial arts-- enough to get you interested, but not too much that it's all he talks about. I highly recommend reading this book!"
3,How can you know?,"I'm interested in this product, however, in the details and PDF file I don't see much detailed information about how to attach a webcam to it, or what(what type) of webcams are compatible with it.Webcams can come in all shapes and sizes. A screw option, and even a velcro option may not work.This is what is holding me back from purchasing this product."
3,idea good....design not good,"i use this product however, one week after receiving it the plastic part which the webcam sits on broke in half and i had to use heavy duty glue to repair it. If you move the cam around much, eventually the part which attaches to the edge of the desk will come loose and the entire assembly will fall over. I am not being rough with the product either, it is just not particularly stable. I hope they will improve on some of these design problems since it is a good idea! After it broke, i should have returned it for another one, but was just too much trouble to do so."
1,Be sure what you are ordering,"Read the product description carefully. The first half is dedicated to the flexible webcam arm/stand. This is the product I wanted. The second part is a rendevous pack (condoms, etc.). This is NOT what I wanted, but that was what was shipped."
2,BEWARE-THIS IS A SINGLE,this is a single and you will get the songs on other albums. there are no b-sides or unreleased tracks. spend the money on the album itself. if you are a completist and don't have it don't let this review stop you. however just know that you are not getting anything new.
5,Last studio recording by the best Aggro Industrial metal band ever!,"Germany's Testify deliver an incredulous ambush of aggro-industrial-metal that will surely delight fans into these genres. I have never understood why a band so great as Testify remains virtually unknown in America. If you like bands like VNV Nation, Rammstein, Fear Factory, etc... you will surely embrace Testify. Hopefully with the release of this album and support from the media to help increase sales, Testify will become a better known band. The album tracks combine elements of aggression, melodrama and metallic overtones. Yes, you can dance to this record and clubs like the Batcave in NYC should be spinning it. I urge you to give this album a listen and help spread the word on Testify"
5,Enjoy!,Hey! let's talk about The Descendents-Enjoy! great artwork! good songs! extra-funny lyrics! In resume that's awesome!
5,Blink 18...who???,"All this talk about Blink 182, A new found glory, Green day...etc.. Comedic Punk started here with Descendents. This is one of my all time favorites cd's. Enjoy is funny from the start, And ends with recorded farts. I could babble on and on about how great they are and all, but why bother. If you like blink's sound, this is where it came from. Also check out Circle Jerks ""Group Sex"" for more original comedic punk."
1,This CD is repetitive and annoying!!!,"Standouts are Wendy, Sour Grapes, Get The Time (Still sounds like Kids and Hurtin' Crue...), Cheer (pleasant, but we've heard this before...Why do ALL of these songs sound so damn similar?!).Worst tracks are Enjoy, Kids, Hurtin' Crue (Why does this have the same annoying melody as Kids?! We JUST HEARD THAT SONG!!!! UGH!!), Orgofart...gross!!, 80's Girl (YAWN, majorly...), Green (Skips), Days Are Blood (I'm officially giving up on this band that only knows the same three chords (>_<), Orgo51 (...).This CD is CRAP. If you listen to this, then fine. Do what you want. But I won't stand for **** like this!!!I don't think any alternative CD is worse than this one!!! It's gotta be in the 100 worst CDs EVER!!!1.25 stars."
2,looks nice...but,"Its probably the nicest looking case for the Tungsten T2, but does not provide a great deal of protection or usefulness.The T2 snaps in giving you access to being able to expand it via the open top, but it does not always rest securely in the case and can fall out of position relatively easily. It also is not very functional. It holds 2 mmr cards backwards so you cannot see the title of the card and it does not offer any kind of storage space for headphones, business cards, or anything else. It also folds open but the cover does not bend all the way behind the back of the case, so it is a bit cumbersome to hold in one hand."
2,hard case returned as it did not fit,Confusion regarding the exact use had to return. Advertsiment was not clear but the picture and wording suggested I had chosen the right item. Problem was there was no effort to provide the proper replacement.
3,OK case,decent case for the money. not aluminum though and i found a better aluminum case for about the same money and replaced. shop around and you may find better for similar money
1,DON'T BUY - Your Tungsten is AT RISK !!!,"Beyond the fact this hard case is BULKY & UNPRACTICAL (you cannot pull down your Tungsten open any longer), the poor design really put your Palm at risk : the two little hooks that fasten the PDA to the case are attached to the most fragile part of the Tungsten, i.e. the sliding back panel. I almost had the Tungsten RIPPED APART when I first try to remove it from the case. So I just decided to trash the case.The Tungsten is an exceptional PDA, but this case doesn't even deserve its Palm brand name. Sure it's hard, but primarly to your Tungsten."
1,Slim leather case is much better,Opening and closing the palm T while it is in the hard case is very awkward. It is VERY easy to unintentionally unseat the palm from the case. I found it clunky and dysfunctional. At least with the slim leather case sliding the palm open and closed is very easy and it stays connected to the case until you intend to take it out.
1,DOES NOT FIT T3!!,"This item is listed under ""accessories"" for a Palm Tungsten T3 in Amazon's site. It does NOT fit the T3, the T3 is slightly taller than the TT and T2.Do not buy this if you own a T3. In fact, don't buy it if you have a TT or T2 either, as it is not a very good case. It is plastic, even though it is billed as ""aluminum,"" it is HUGE and bulky compared to your TT, which is why you bought it in the first place, right?There are several better options out there."
1,wii control gloves,"These were pretty inexpensive, and I got that I paid for. Very thin wii control skin, not like what came on the original. And I could not choose the color, so I got another white one which I really didn't want.DF"
5,What I was looking for,Many of my friends have this book and I wanted a copy also. It was exactly what I was looking for. It has different juices to help with different ailments. It contains lots of additional information to help you have healthier eating habits that would make you feel better as a result. It is truly a treasure. I make my juices with the Vita-Mix juicer which gives me the added benefit of keeping all the fiber from the fruits and vegetables. I wouldn't think of using any other juicer for making quality juices.
1,"Just because it is in writting, doesn' t mean its true.","BEWARE - DO YOU BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ?. This is a book filled with opinion. This is clearly evident with the statement that ""diet is the #1 cause of cancer"". It is widely accepted by the medical community that stress, diet and the environment are factors but based on the latest research of the American Cancer Society, heredity is the #1 cause of cancer, smoking is #2. Heredity not diet, is the main cause of disease and unfortunately we can't choose our parents and our parents couldn't choose theirs. It is without a doubt that fresh juice from time to time is good for our health but it is entirely over rated in this book. The authors may have good intentions however, this gives people false hope that they can CURE cancer or other serious disease with juicing."
4,JUICING FOR LIFE,"The text is excellent but I know the original book, which was fully illustrated. This copy was a big disappointment and far too expensive for what it is."
4,Juicing for Life,It was easy to understand. I 'm just now getting into juicing so it's all new to me. I would recommend it to others.
4,Juicing for Life,Juicing for Life includes more than juice recipes. It has good information on lifestyle changes that can be made for specific aliments. I would recommend this product.
4,Good to have,"Very good to have if u like smoothies, shakes all types of food especially if u on the go alot"
4,Decent info.,"Decent all around info in this book, but it's arranged by disorder or malady. I was looking for a book which was ordered by food group not just the condition. I returned it."
3,Choices,The information in this book is brief and well stated. It's a good start for those interested in a healthier lifestyle.
2,Dated Material,"I thought that I would like this book given the reviews that I read, but after getting it I relaized that the information seemed very dated. The copyright of book is 1992. Some of the information on specific health issues has changed or doesn't take into account some current science on the issues. There is more that is understood about digestive health almost 10 years later and far more interesting reads. I returned it to Amazon."
5,Great,I think I will find lots of recipes here to use. I am just getting back into juicing and just got my new juicer. I look forward to using this book and experimenting!
5,great book,Book reviews nutritional needs and the different fruits and vegetables that are needed to maintain health or acquire good health due to disease/ailments
4,nothing new,"Enjoyed reading the book, but lets face it....You can only write so much about juice.....Not trying to be a pessimist, but the vast majority of these juicing books are all alike, except for the covers."
3,would not be 1st choice,"Be careful if you take this book into the kitchen. It is printed on the cheapest of papers and tears and damages easily if it gets wet. The recipes are o.k.; the information is o.k., although conflicts with some information in her Coconut Diet book, but nothing very interesting or inspirational is shared."
3,Not what I expected,"I was expecting more on detoxing and colon cleansing. There are some good recipes and good health information, but I probably should have gotten a book on Juicing for detox and cleansing as I have fibromyalgia. The book is set up as a guide to use certain recipes for specific conditions. It does not list Fibromyalgia and I know that people with FMS are supposed to avoid certain things, like night shade vegetables: white potatoes, eggplant and a whole list of other things. This is my first book on juicing. I'm sure it will come in handy, but it probably won't be my only source. I need to find one that addresses detoxing and cleansing."
2,Pass this by,"What might be an interesting piece of musical history is utterly sunk by awful sound quality - for which Opera D'Oro is notorious. With excellent mid-priced recordings by Salonen, Ozawa, & Ancerl in the catalogue, you can well afford to pass this one by.Bob Rixon"
3,"A nice radio broadcast, mostly of historical interest","Curiosity led me to this Oedipus Rex from Karajan, who had a substantial relationship with Italian radio in the early Fifties. The sound is decent AM radio mono (other versions besides this one from Opera d""oro have somewhat clearer, less dull sound). Karajan took little interest in certain composers: Stravinsky and Berlioz were two. He never returned to Oedipus Rex (he even avoided major works like Petrushka), so this is it, a competent but not at all individual performance. The orchestra and male chorus are fine, and they are the most enjoyable things here. The various unknown vocal soloists, all Italian except for the Hungrian Laszlo as Jocasta, don't leave much of an impression, but they are never less than good. In all, I'd say this recording is mainly of historical interest, or for die-hard Karajan collectors."
3,"one down, two to go","House of shame and white slaves are interesting: much torture and a crazy, constant voice-over. Real sleazy , cheap movies. Dance hall girls is just boooooring, no torture and nothing happening."
