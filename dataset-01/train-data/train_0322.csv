4,A worthwhile read,"I was looking forward to Plantation after thoroughly enjoying (and recommending to several others) Sullivan's Island. I didn't feel this was quite as good as S.I., but still an enjoyable, fun, and sometimes emotional read. I would have to agree that the first 200 or so pages felt very LOOOONG and drawn out, but the rest is very good, with a particularly excellent last 100 or so. Well drawn, 3 dimensional characters and Ms. Frank definately knows how to make you feel a part of the goings-on. Read this one for fun-- you don't have to think hard, but it isn't completely fluff either."
4,Another classic Benton Frank read,"This was probably one of the better Dot Frank books I have read. Although, I think this book could have been shorter. There were some slow moving parts in the book that I think can be eliminated without taking anything away from the content. I love the humor and the southern flair. (Unique characteristics of the Lowcountry Tales). This book was about Caroline and her family. Caroline and her mother have always had a somewhat strained relationship ever since the death of her father. When Caroline comes home with her son Eric, after leaving her cheating husband in NY, the relationship starts to mend. And later when Lavinia is diagnosed with a terminal illness, Caroline learns how much her mother really did love her. This is a great book if you are interested in southern settings and tradition. I wouldn't have read all of Frank's books if I didn't enjoy them."
5,Wonderful,"Dorothea Benton Frank's ""Plantation"" is as good as her first, ""Sullivan's Island."" She did an extremely good job in capturing the Southern's essence, values, beliefs and just the culture. One can get a feel of how it's like to live in the South and how the Southern people think and act.This book deals with Caroline Levine, whose relationships with her family is anything but okay. The theme of this book is how she rebuilds her relationship with her mother, how she misunderstood her mom when she was young and finally, she understood why her mom was the way she was. She learns more about her family roots and finally came to an understanding that, the plantation was where she belonged.The book is fills with warmth, love, and just what we need to relax and have a good laugh. I highly recommend this book."
1,Too Much Filler,"I tried, really I did! I picked this book because the of the title and for its length. I wish I could say there was more to it than that. I was severely disappointed with this book. I think after reading the back cover it seemed interesting enough. But when the story goes on and on about nothing really that striking, I kept wondering when it would ever end. The writing was hoping to be humourous, but slightly missing the mark. The foreshading was too obvious, and the characters stereotypical. I think perhaps it would have been an ok read if there wasn't so much filler in between the story. I couldn't make it to the end. And I didn't care enough for wonder what happened with the characters. There are better books out there about family relationships."
3,Where was the editor?,"Why, oh why did Ms. Frank's editor let this book go out with the first 250 pages as they are? This would be a great book if you start at page 250 and get someone to tell you briefly what is in the first part. More people in the South will sympathize with Fannie Mae than with stuck-up Caroline. Siddion's had the right formula with classy-girl-from-poor-family. This looks like no-class family does a sudden and unbelievable turn-around."
5,Fantastic!!!,"I readall her books. this one was what I knew it would be,great,like all herbooks are. Everyone should try at least one, and they will be hookedtoo.Thank You__"
4,Tragic but very good,"This was an excellent book, but such a sad story. An old family in South Carolina, generations living within the same Plantation, Tall Pines, and such a history. Caroline is the eldest child and only daughter of the family living on the Plantation currently. After the tragic death of her father, she left for school and had no intentions of living in South Carolina again. Caroline's own life had it's ups and downs and she decides to move back to the plantation to stay with her mother, the colorful Miss Lavinia.Once Caroline and her young son become settled back into Tall Pines, everything begins to change. She understands where she comes from and begins to get an appreciation for it, as well as her relationship with her mother. Just when things are going well, Lavinia takes a turn for the worse.I had be thinking about reading a book by Dorothea Benton Frank for a long time and finally chose this one, which I loved. I just hope they aren't all so tragic."
5,Miss Lavinia Is A Hoot!,"If you love a good story about the south, or even if you just love to laugh out loud when you're the only one home you've got to read Plantation. My mother and I bought this book at the same time and we just love to get together and discuss the delightful, zany characters and their equally zany lives. The story revolves around a woman,Caroline, who had moved from the ACE Basin of South Carolina to bustling New York City for college to escape her cantankerous mother, Lavinia. When Caroline's brother calls to tell her that ""Miss Lavinia"" has tried to shoot him, Caroline rushes home to ""see about Mother"" only to find that life on Tall Pines Plantation has not changed one bit, but that maybe she has. Be prepared to sit for hours with this book as you won't want to put it down for fear of missing one of Lavinia's episodes."
1,Don't recommend this trike,"The company is great and shipping is wonderful. The product falls apart, the steering system never tightens up. The wheels are plastic and don't move well, then after a short time the pedal just moved but the wheel didn't. Disappointing for the cost."
4,Kids Loved it,I purchased this for my grandaughter. She loved it. I wish it would not of been made of plastic. The bike worked well and she was in love with the color. A true gift for any kid.
2,cute but don't last long,"It a very perty Pink, my then three year old loved it for about a week! Got left out side in the rain and sun, color faded and paddes fell off."
5,Beautiful trike.,"I love this trike, the quality is great. The price was very good. You don't see these at stores. Very nice, my daughter loves it. Get lots of compliments,"
3,Cheaper is better...,"I bought this product after using Dr. Elsey's Cat litters and Litter Attract, which I highly recommend. However, this product failed to turn out the same result. I can still faintly smell the cat pee so decided to try to stean clean my carpets w/ vinegar in my steam cleaner. This worked 10 times better than all of the products that I have bought. I would recommend this product for small areas but not for a large area, which is what I had."
1,Nothing Amazing,"Unfortunately this product did little more for us than many others we have tried. Did not resolve the cat urine small in our carpet, even with white vinegar as suggested. The same line of litter attracting product worked amazingly, however this was no win for us :("
3,Eh,"Ok, the product worked, but it was way more work than I bargained for. When they say program they really mean program and the program is more for you than the cat. Its not a sprinkle and let em tinkle solution, but meh it does work."
5,I really enjoyed this book.,"Its very dated but its great sci-fi! I especially loved the last short story in the book, it was a real mind bender. I highly recommend this book."
5,Awesome,"I'd never seen the extended version, it's great... the added scenes are basically those that strengthen the intimate bond that is made between the two lead characters. It plays up the ""lolita"" situation without being distasteful, it never goes too far. THere are a few dark scenes that look grainy, but the overall transfer to HD is pretty great. I don't review story, I leave it to people to find out for themselves."
4,Leon - The Professional,"I have always liked the French actor Jean Reno,so this movie was an obvious choice for me.It has a lot of violence,but the rest of the movie was excellent!"
5,see this version,Do yourself a favor: see this version! There is so much more in the Director's cut.
3,This disc has screwed up 5.1 surround sound!,"This movie is great, I love it! But if you're getting this DVD expecting awesome Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, don't bother. When playing the movie in DD5.1 the rear surrounds are almost absent. You can only faintly hear any sound when you hold your ear up to it. The pro-logic track sounds far better. If you have an awesome surround sound setup, you might want to think twice, because the mix sounds more like 3.1 surround rather than 5.1."
1,Leon(Amazon),The main movie would not play on any of my DVD players While the extras disc played on all of them. In all fairness I must admit that the main disc appeared to be in perfect condition I don't see how this problem could have been anticipated. I do feel that the item should have been replaced instead of having to wait 10 days for my account to be credited. I feel Amazon should change this policy
4,Portman & Reno unbeatable,"I watched this years ago and recently revisited it again. Natalie Portman's coming out was gang-busters. This was a hard act for her to follow. She played a girl trying to survive in a dangerous world that didn't give a damn. It was a powerful role that she did so well. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it. Jean Reno was a combination of vulnerable and dangerous. He was a highly effective assassin but illiterate and was cheated by his ""friend"" who lined up his jobs for him and kept his money. It was wonderful to see him snared by Portman's character and his slowly becoming absolutely dedicated to her. I own this movie from which I became a Jean Reno fan. I don't think either one has played a better movie."
4,Leon - The Prfessional,This is a very good action pack movie along with showing the real humanatarianism in a professional assasin. To him it is only a job and deep down inside he is a very sensitive and caring person. His care and affection for his young orphaned protege is heart warming.
5,Intense,"Not wanting to write a spoiler, I'll just note the conversation this film provoked when I saw it with a friend:""So, why doesn't she pull a Glock out of that bag and turn him into Swiss cheese?""""Metal detector.""""So, why doesn't she whip out a ceramic knife and stab him in the heart?""And, I wanted her to stab him in the heart so badly I could visualize it."
3,Ghost Dog did it better,"Die-hard Besson/Reno fans will disagree with me, but here's how I see The Professional: good concept, good team ... so-so execution.Want a much cooler version of this story? See Ghost Dog by Jim Jarmusch."
1,Bad movie,Found myself wanting to put a bullet through Leons head at the end of this movie...well if he still had a head.Very unreal movie and that doesnt have to be a bad thing normaly but well...not if its meant to be like reality.
5,"A classic, great story, great action and great acting.","This is one of those rare movies that successfuly crosses action with a real story and incredible acting. The Professional is the story of a young girl adopted by a professional assassin after her family is murdered by crooked cops, and their life together as she seeks vengeance.The storyline is clever and interesting, with a great 'bad guy' played by Gary Oldman who'll send shivers down your spine everytime he's on screen. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman also do a great job as the assassin and girl, growing closer throughout the film, but keeping a realistic uncomfortableness between them.As far as action goes, few movies surpass The Professional. From the great opening scene, to the incredible climax, this is the kind of movie DVD's were made for. I don't know of anybody who hasn't enjoyed this movie, action fans and not, it's a must see."
5,loveable hitman,"Must see movie! A hitman (Jean Reno) saves the life of a young girl (Natalie Portman) and the two form a special if not unlikely bond. Gary Oldman is messed up and great at it as usual :-)). This movie has it all. Great acting, cool story line, it is funny at times and sad aswell. Our teen and pre-teen both love this movie and we have watched it many times since I bought it (about 3 years ago I think). I highly recommend this one!"
4,its gotta be a classic,though some people didnt find this movie moving or great but I did. its about a hitman named Leon(Jean Reno) who gets involved with Natalie Portman after her family gets killed by Gary Oldman and his henchmen. Portman wants revenge for her familys death and Reno shows her the way. with some non-stop action that brings the movie to its title name. Oldman is great to watch as the mad pill popping dirty cop.
5,Brilliant!,"Jean Reno is absolutely brilliant in his quiet, yet highly dangerous, portrayal of a French hitman who reluctantly takes little Natalie Portman under his wing. The little girl humanizes the hitman and you find yourself actually rooting for the paid assassin, even more so when oily, reptilian bad guy Gary Oldman pops up. I can honestly say that before The Professional, I'd never considered a hitman to be the hero, but this movie changes all of that! Reno has a quiet intensity that makes you pay attention to his every move and nuance. Action film lovers will not be disappointed: there are plenty of shoot 'em up scenes and blood flying about to keep them happy."
2,"professional movie, but not professionally made",I had seen this movie atleast one time before and remembered what a great movie it was. Unfortunately I was sad when I received the movie to find it was not even in HD and the picture quality was quite bad.
4,A Beautiful Masterpiece,"This movie is wonderful. It's about a lone hitman-for-hire who saves a girl from a corrupt DEA agent who killed her family. The story goes on and the ending is simply superb. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman play their parts perfectly.There is an editor's cut version of this film for sale on the Internet elsewhere (forgot the URL) which is said to have 20 more minutes, which mostly teaches the viewers about the characters themselves. Director Luc Besson said personally he liked the original version (the one on sale here) better.In conclusion, go buy the movie. This is a film that should be on every home's shelf."
4,"Best action movie, even if you really dont like action","This movies strangs story line and bizzare batch of characters mixed with exciting gun fights create a great movie. Some say Oldman over does it in this one but I disagree. Oldman is playing a crooked cop who is on some kind of drugs (it's never revealed what he is on) and Oldman plays him beautifully because the character is supposed to be creepy and impossible to understand. So if you don't like his character dont knock oldman. Both Portman and Reno do well in The Professional, Reno as a secluded French hit man (or cleaner as he is called in the movie) and Portman as an enigma of a little girl who lives down the hall from Leon (played by Reno)."
5,Leon - The Professional,"This is the 3rd version of this movie I've purchased, and each one adds a little more to the storyline, this one is probably the best out of the 3 I have. It definitely fills in a lot of the blanks!!!"
5,great movie poor streaming,"Movie was great, but tons of problems with streaming and delays. will probably stick to other streaming products in the future"
5,Best assassin film ever made.,"Very few action films are realistic, which them very hard to watch, at least for me. When I was going through Army Special Forces training in the late 90'2 we watched the sreet fight scene from the movie Heat and the scene in The Professional where the police are entering Leon's apartment. Classic lessons learned films. This movie is a must watch for anyone for a variety of reasons. It's about shady friends, dysfunctional families, and a love and strong bond formed by a man and 11 y/o girl who come from those respective situations. They join forces to exact revenge on the cops that killed her family and baby brother. This a must see film and one of the best action movies ever!"
4,"Amazing film, great edition.","Leon: The Professional is a great film. It is a fantastic action film that goes beyond that. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is not only sweet but real, and you have no choice but to care for these characters.Gary Oldman is terrifi, as usual. Not only terrific, but terrifying. He is the ultimate bad guy.The sets, the music, the performances, the effects, the direction... Leon is one of those few films in which everything seems to fit.This DVD edition has a really good transfer. It is obviously the extended cut, which is far better than the US theatrical release. It is a two disc edition with some nice extras. Not as many as one would hope, but good ones anyway.I would strongly recommend buying this Deluxe edition."
4,BRILLIANT,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE. GARY OLDMANS PERFORMANCE IS INTENSE. I WILL NEVER FORGET THESE TWO LINES,""NO WOMEN NO CHILDREN"" AND ""EVERYONE"""
5,The meaning of true love and true friendship,"There is no doubt in my mind that ""The Professional"" is one of the best movies that I have ever viewed. It is a realistic portrayal of an incident that could very well happen in any one of our lives. Moreover, the movie proves the point that under every hard-core, macho, bravado person, there is still a glimmer of love."
5,Gary Oldman at his best,"I am a huge fan of Gary Oldman, and I am forever hoping that the rest of the planet recognizes him for the genius that he is. This film is just one more piece of evidence for my case. His performance as Norman Stansfield is the most twisted and brilliant villain portrayal I have seen in a long time. That, in addition to the excellent chemistry between Portman an Jean Reno only add to one great action packed film. This movie is definitely worth buying."
4,"Good movie, but I've got technical problems with this one.","I've ordered 2 copies of this DVD and have suffered the same disapointment with both of them. NO audio. Its quite bizzare. When the main menu is up there is the background music and so forth, but anywhere in the movie there is no sound, no audio.. Never have had this problem with any other DVD i've rented or purchased. The video is all there and seems just fine. Sigh, now sending this second copy back to amazon."
4,Excelent work this extended edition,"It was quiet an experience to watch ""Leon"" in this Extended Edition in Blue Ray. A master piece."
4,I Feel More Consummate Already!,"My boss is always harping on me to be 'more professional'. I don't know what he's talking about. I show up at the office at least three days a week, and cry under my desk for the alotted four-and-a-half hours. I even wear pants occasionally.Still, he complains. So I made a good faith effort to tap into this 'professionalism' business he's always yapping about.I finally decided the best way to BE professional was to LEARN from a professional. Or rather, THE Professional. So I bought this disc, hoping for some pointers on how to get along in the corporate world.I learned three things. Never short a DEA agent if you're asked to hold a stash. Never make fun of an Italian wearing John Lennon glasses. And never open a bank account with Danny Aiello.I don't know if that makes me more 'professional', exactly. But if I ever need my boss rubbed out, at least I know who to look for."
3,Watchout - Violent movie w/ Hints of Perversity.,"The characters in this movie (so typical of the French) are unusual, whacky, and totally unexpected - basically the story revolves around a lonely hitman who has single relationship with a houseplant until a young girl, trying to escape from a brutal DEA agent (played by Gary Oldman), places herself into his reluctant care. Meantime as their relationship strenghtens the young girl developes a crush on this hitman. While I dont think this is unusual, the reaction of the guy though is perverse. C'mon, she cant be any older than 12! I enjoyed the movie until this disturbing developement in the story.Of course, Gary Oldman's played his usual crazed, maniacal, violent, unpredictable character.PS.. I honestly never thought Natalie Portman could act until I saw her in this movie - very different from her booooring portrayal in the yucky Star Wars prequel."
2,Same old glorified cop killin',"Sure Leon's the hero, even though he shot about dozen innocent cops and blew the rest up. It's the same as Face/off. It seems that in most movies the SWAT officers just run into the situation, guns a blazin' without any planning or care for innocents. The rest of the movie is good, though. I just wish Hollywood understood that a SWAT cop is still a cop."
2,too violent,"teaches people it's ok to lieteaches people it's ok to be violentteaches people the wrong concept of lovenevertheless, it is kind of a capturing movie.the story has holes in it."
1,SOUND PROBLEMS - Amazon Return Policy Poor Customer Service!,"My schedule did not allow me to watch this movie immediately after receiving the product in the mail. By the time I got around to having time to sit down and watch the movie I was well past the available return date for Amazon purchases.The Blu-ray has NO WORKING ENGLISH track available during the movie - the sound works fine for all the bonus / special features, but during the actual movie - playback will not play in English. Yes, my Blu-Ray player is up to date; yes, I've tried all the various other settings available - it's the disc. The English Audio track was not properly copied onto this disc. And no one will take responsibility for replacement. Not Amazon, not Sony ...What a waste of money!I certainly won't be purchasing Blu-Ray movies from Amazon again."
1,"Another disgrace -- thank you, ""Hollywood""","The ""geniuses"" who manage Sony Pictures have yet again demonstrated their utter contempt for American film watchers. This time they excised 23 minutes of vital scenes from the movie while remastering it in Blu-ray format.Either they think we are all ""Bible-thumpers"" incapable of handling fictional adult themes or they think we are so stupid that we will purchase first this heavily-censored version and then in six months be happy to purchase a second Blu-ray version containing the actual movie Luc Besson shot.Boycott this version! But definitely buy the 133 minute one when it is released in high definition."
5,Surprisingly Tender,"Twenty-something years after it's release, The Professional still holds it's own against just about anything I've seen out in the past few years. If you're Roger Ebert and can't handle why a 12 year old character is in a movie like this, don't rent it. (Uh, hello...that's part of why it's a compelling story, Rog!)On my fav list as a coming of age movie (of sorts), The Professional delivers compelling, tender moments amidst chilling, cold-blooded killing - try writing a movie like THAT. Oldman is simply out-of-the-box freaky as I've seen very few actors. Wild. Portman defines adorable - a role she reprises later in Beautiful Girls - slowly breaking down Reno's factory worker type hitman character. Cover your eyes during the bloody parts if you have to. It's a small price to pay for a wonderful flick."
5,A terrific tale of hope,"Leon is a lonely hitman from another country. Portman is a lonely girl from a derangged family. This movie is so heart breaking at the end. Jean Reno, gives a great performance and the young Natalie Portman fits the role amazingly. This is Titanic 1000 times more dramatic."
4,"Could be better, but not much","""The Professional"" ranks right up there with John Woo's ""The Killer"" and ""Hard-Boiled"" in the ""Killer-with-a-conscience"" genre. My only real complaint was the lack of more ""cleaning jobs"". I mean, there were only about three in the whole movie and we didn't get to see one of them. If you could combine the in-depth story/drama of this movie with some of the action of John Woo's hits, the compilation would be the greatest action movie ever. Last, but not least, Luc Besson is great. I loved this movie and I liked his ""Fifth Element"" even more. I hope he keeps this up. Overall, buy and watch this movie multiple times."
1,A very ugly looking Blu-ray transfer.,"First of all: I love this movie. It should have received a much better treatment than it has now. The standard DVD was by no means perfect. The Blu-ray is awful. Image contrast has been boosted to ridiculous heights, leaving no detail in any tone slightly lighter than a midtone. So as soon as daylight enters the picture: shadow areas stay and the rest dissolves into a white, bleached out glare...Sony should be forced to rerelease!"
4,Very well done,one of Natalie Portman's finest roles - what was she 12? really nice relationship and character development - well done!
5,Luc Besson At His Finest!,"""The Professional"" is the thinking man's action flick. After seeing the original Americanized watered-down version, I was hooked. With the release of the uncut edition, many loose ends from the editied version are tied up. Perhaps the most compelling aspect is the inclusion of more of Leon's backstory, which helps audiences more closely relate to the hitman. I reccomend this version for anyone who enjoys a good action movie and can tolerate some violence and profanity.As a side note, I bought this edition and had no problems with the video track--mine was mastered fine and worked properly, so I assume that the disc a customer made mention of on this site was part of a faulty batch of discs that was later corrected."
5,Exceptional,"A superb film that definitely benefits from being seen in its full version. As other reviewers have done such a good job of describing the contents, I just wanted to allay the concerns of some potential viewers.Some people have used variants of the word 'pedophilia' in describing the interactions between the 12 year-old played so brilliantly by Portman, and Leon. This is an inappropriate use of this often mis-used word. The Direction here is such that there is no exploitative footage, and while the story's Lolita undercurrents are clearly there, they do not detract from what is a superb thriller and action movie.Such irresponsible mis-uses of the word ironically undermine the seriousness of true pedophilia which often involves children under the age of five, which is truly sick and obscene.Portman's streetwise 12 year-old should not make anybody feel uncomfortable. She is a fine actress and this is a fine movie."
3,Remarkable Natalie,"The Professional is not credible, lacks energy, which is surprising for a thriller, and borders on pedophilia in its presentation of a beautiful child all dressed up in come-on outfits. On the other hand, that child, Natalie Portman, is stunning as an actress. And the many closeups don't hurt either."
3,silly,"This is an absurd and unbelievable movie. But Jean Reno has a Steve McQueen kind of masculine presence, and Natalie Portman is so beautiful and adorable, I still sort of enjoyed it."
3,Revenge: OK or a next menthal disorder?,"A story is of a professional killer assisting eighteen year old girl to avenge the murdering of her entire family, hated father-drug dealer, mother and siblings, by corrupted investigators.What a psychiatric disorder might in this case be diagnosed???"
3,Great until......,"If you're a Jean Reno fan, you'll love this. The movie has everything you want, until about 30 minutes in, when his character considers shooting Natalie Portman's Matilde. Prior to that point, it's great (particularly when Reno's character goes to the movies). Afterwards, it's hokey and unbelievable. Also, and maybe this is a ""cultural thing"", but Besson clearly believes that the prepubescent (at this time) Portman is sexually interesting. Aiello, Portman, and Oldman all do very well, and of course Reno never makes a false move, so what's wrong here? Either the screenplay or the director, I think."
2,not happy w/ the way I received DVD,"I am not happy w/ the way I received this DVD. When I took it out of the box it was shipped in, I could tell that the DVD was loose in its case, rolling around. It is a Christmas gift so I am not opening it to check it. I am going to hope that the DVD is not scratched. I am very upset that the DVD showed up in this condition, and now I have to hope it's ok to give as a Christmas gift."
5,A Great Film That Will Never Die.,This is just one of those rare type of movies that come across every so often that really captures true human emotion without all the attention being focused on how many times something blows up or someone uttering a ridiculous line that forever huants the rest of that films celuloid life. This film is truly a work of art and will forever be one of my favorites.
4,Very Entertaining -- GREAT Jobs By the Actors,"While this story requires a bit of suspension of disbelief (all that shooting, for instance, would have attracted immediate attention from neighbors and the authorities), the portrayals of the characters are superb. Young Natalie Portman was particularly stellar. Cynics might suggest that the child she played could never in real life have had the focus and desire to have learned the assassin's trade (as tought to her by The Professional) -- but such thinking collapses if you consider that the real-life Natalie had all the personal discipline necessary for making this film, and doing such a great job of it, at her youthful age."
5,"Loved the American release, then I saw this one","I rated the American release a 5 star rating, this one should get a 6. The movie is not a typical action movie. The plot develops far better than average, the cast develops the roles far better, and the directing is first rate. very much along the same lines as La Femme Nikita, also by Besson with a smaller role by Reno, the movie is moved along by its story, not by the explosions and the action on the screen. The hit-man with his tag-along child who decides to work for him to learn the skills to get revenge takes work to pull it off, and this movie does so in style. If you are not familiar with the films of Luc Besson, this is a great movie to start with. You may even decide to give The Fifth Element another shot."
4,Bet on Besson,"Many people who watch this film will probably become life-long fans of both Luc Besson and Jean Reno.For the remainder, there must be very few who would feel disappointed that they bought it.This film works on so many levels, that you'll be talking about it afterwards for days. It's violent, touching, action-packed, delicate, provocative yet shallow.The change of tempo throughout the movie is the most striking directorial feature, and the one that will leave you begging for the next cut-scene at the finale. Fortunately Besson leaves it, as he usually does, without patronising his audience.Reno is simply frighteningly brilliant. Alternately wooden when out of his depth with his new protege, to fluid machine when within the role of assassin, his near one-man show carries the directorial tempo perfectly.Thoroughly recommended."
5,A Movie I Can Relate To,"I thought ""The Professional"" was outstanding! This action-packed drama full of the wonderful mixes of suspense and violence is garunteed to leave you breathless! I cried bags at the end! It's plot relates to that of ""Terminator 2"" but with venegence squeezed in there. Now, I'm not really a big softy or anything but I want you realize how POWERFUL ""The Professional"" was: it was strong enough to make me cry. Although I'm justa 14- year old girl, I GIVE THIS MOVIE 5 STARS....hey, everyone's a critic, haha!"
5,An All Around GREAT !!! Movie,This is a Great Movie ! Leon is unforgetable and this movie is Natalie Portman at her best. The professional is a MUST SEE ! Five Stars *****
4,where's the DD5.1?,This version of the movie is great but the 5.1 surround is close to non existent. The movie itself deserves 5 stars but because of the sound problem the dvd only deserves 4. The Pro Logic surround is actually better than the 5.1!
5,Why I loved the book,"A lot of events happen in this book, the loss of one of the companions plus 2 other people and the resulting emotional reactions were very touching."
4,Christmas present,The box is well made only issue is the locking latch the loop is very small. Works great for a boys first tool box
1,Really Bad Science Fiction,"First, I would like to mention that I'm a relatively easy reader to please. There aren't many books I haven't managed to enjoy on one level or another. That said, this is absolutely the worst sci-fi novel I've ever read, followed closely by ""Armor"". However, I did manage to finish both of them - how or why I'll never figure out. Complete waste of time I'll never get back."
5,great,It is a good product. It works well on my captain and fold down chairs. I would recommend it for anyone.
4,Fascinating Eye-witness account of Yugoslavia in WWII,"Djilas was Tito's 2nd man in the communist partisan movement in WWII. They fought against Germans, Italians, Hungarians, Royal Serbs (Tschetnizi) and national Croats (Ustashi) and succeeded. Often left alone by their allies (east and west), they faced death more than once. But this is not a heroic recount of that time, no pro-communist biased official praise.Djilan, who was arrested in the 50ies and 60ies for openly opposing comunism/stalinism here gives an evenhanded account on how things were, not sparing out the atrocities done by the partisans.The book is easy to read, but a little short on background information, so you'll have to check some facts, names, places yourself.One of the best books on WWII I've read."
3,a mixture for the reader,"I found this book to be delightful and disappointing. I loved the story by Bertrice Small, my all-time favorite romance author. She did not disappoint me with her decadent and delicious tale. Thea Devine's tale was not to my liking, as none of her writing has been, though I did actually manage to finish reading this story. Jane Bonander wrote a sweet tale of a sister trying to play matchmaker for her brother. It was a fun read. The book is worth the price for Bertrice Small's story. I only wish it had been longer."
2,Ho-hum romance,"I found this book to display some of the best aspects of romance stories, and the worst. The best being the emotional struggle for the characters in the Bonander story which was affecting, and the wort being the utterly shallow and insipid writing of Small. The Small romance had no detail of plot, character, or circumstance. It was as if the elements were chosen at random from a Arabian mad-lib, and strung together with lots of adverbs. The love scenes were especially disappointing, with mechanical explainations of love acts, having no purpose other than to be ""naughty"". The Thea Devine story was a pleasant deviation from the tiresome girl-plotting-to-trap/impress-guy scenario, with compelling love scenes. One last thing; I didn't consider any of the men to be ""Rogues""."
4,Fundamental Spanish by Barbara Bregstein,"I am finding this book very useful. I am teaching myself Spanish, and this book sets everything out in a clear and logical manner and then provides exercises so that one becomes familiar with the concepts. I really like it!"
3,Easy to work frim,"Not 100% thorough (where are imperatives?), but it has been a good daily self-study guide over my daily cup of Mexican java."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this book to give my daughter and her friend a head start this summer before they begin Spanish in school. I am teaching them from it and have noticed that it is a bit jumbled and not as orderly as I would have liked. The order in which it is taught is not how I remembered it in school. Also, I wish there was a word glossary in the back to look up words quickly. It will get the job done but, I was hoping for better organization."
3,A good demo,Good of what it provided - quite thorough. But was looking for more experimental and freed up style rather than just application by knife rather than brush.
3,A very pleasant read,"This book is a pleasure to read. It will frequently make you smile and is well worth your time and money. As I live in Europe, I keep thinking that I, too, should take my dog on vacation. We could even take the family car. Who knows what amazing things we would see and do? To start somewhere, we have begun to collect all shots necessary for a dog passport."
1,Very boring and repetitive,"As a Lab owner, I was very excited when this book came out. The best part of the book was when Konik met Ella. After reading about their adventure through Europe for a while, I was glad I checked this book out from the library instead of buying it. Don't get me wrong! I like Ella. She seems to be a good dog. But Konik's style of writing drives me crazy! Very very boring."
2,Dog love,"A dog lover myself, I was intent on finding this book excellent. Unfortunately, too much of the writing was simply fawning over how Ella was ""incredible"" and loved. More of Ella's actual adventures would have made this book better."
2,Two stars because of the love between author and dog.,"I'm puzzled why most people rate this book so highly. Ella is a 'good dog', as the author repeats again and again, but it gets boring quickly being told that repetively. The beginning, when we hear how he found Ella is the best part of the book; after that all the chapters seem the same. How many times do we have to hear that the author can't believe that Ella is actually in a Italian/French/Austrian/restaurant? The travel sections only have three points: Ella is a good dog. Ella amazingly got to eat in restaurants/travel in public transportation,etc. Everyone who meets Ella loves her. Just scramble those three sentences and insert words like 'Venice' and 'Eiffel Tower' and you'll have read the entire book.That said, I do love how much this man adores his dog, and I wish America did allow dogs as much freedom as Europe does."
2,Something Unnatural,"about how this guy obsesses about his dog. Maybe it's because I'm a cat person, but I just can't imagine living such an empty life - a life that revovles around a dog. It's like he lives just to take his dog, or, I guess he'd say daughter, to a golf course? Perhaps he just has problems relating to people, I don't know. THat said, the book was very repetitive...Europe is one big fabulous society....America is bad for having leash laws and forbidding dogs in restaurants....Ella is beautiful, bella, belle...Ella! You're swimming in the Med! Ella, you're dining in a French restaurant! Ella, you pooping in Rome! etc. etc."
3,A missed opportunity.,"The premise of this film is both excellent, interesting and credible. It had the ability to be ""Coma"" for the 90's, and aswell as raising the issue of the vulnerability of the patient role it highlights the occasional corrupt, explotative nature of the Medical profession. All very real fears, all quiet likely and delivered with believable conviction by a sterling cast. Grant is not always quite believable but this may have more to do with his established typecast as the eternal British fop and speaking as an Englishman I have to say both he and then Girlfiend Hurley (who produced this film) do overplay the Englishness with grating regularity! Hackman is brilliantly menacing, Parker is subdued and intelligently simmering.The film gathers a sleuth like pace, like the very best of tense thrillers and then it sells out near the end and ruins the enitire work, divorcing itself from reality for the sake of cheap thrills. A terrible shame!"
1,Read the Book,"After having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out, I was extremely disappointed. The movie very well could be alright on its own merits, but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful."
5,Excellent!,I received exactly what I was expecting and it arrived within the estimated timeframe. This movie is very hard to find in video stores but is an excellent Gene Hackman flick!
5,Whiffle Squeak,This is our daughters absolute favorite. When my children were young their day ended with books being read to them every night before they got tucked in. We went to our library every week which is where we found this treasure. The rhythmic silly tale with tongue twisting words actually helped our daughter with her enunciation as a toddler. The illustrations are outstanding. It's a shame it is no longer being published. So many children are being denied Whiffle Squeaks story.
5,To look through the eyes of a child!,"This is a wonderful read for anyone working with children and families! Offering new perspective on how to look at race and culture! I would recommend this book to anyone working with children and families to take a different approach to working with these families! Written through the eyes of a classroom of three year olds, Paley takes you through a school year to view the changes in language and lives of three year olds!"
5,Glad to See The Media Hasn't Changed!,"I enjoy books about the Civil War. This was a great way to learn about the war from the people who were watching it. Nowdays, we have wars such as the Gulf War on television. Here were the folks who HAD to be your eyes and ears. This would be a great book to have high school classes read as a comparison to seeing a film about Vietnam or Desert Storm, just to see the contrasts. History classes in American History and Journalism would also benefit. For the general public, unless you are interested in these topics, it is a lot of detail to absorb."
2,AWFUL PRINT,"There is a warning on the first page that this might be a bad print, but I'd love it if I had known before buying it.... All the pages on the right side are messed up, first letters in each sentence missing.The book is good for its content, but I'd rather buy a used edition"
5,The best MUSIC will ever be,"Well there is so much to say about Sister Hazel where do I start? They are good, They are great, and there not a mistake! Sister hazel has had outstanding cd's in the past with great songs on them. This is great there lrics talk about life in general. Not like the other artisits out there who focus on one thing this cd is about life and it is amazing! They will soon be they new THING! I loved this cd and you should really buy it RIGHT NOW! -ashley"
4,sounds just like matchbox 20...,"While Sister Hazel's former self titled cd sort of had the same sound as Hootie and the Blowfish, their newest CD, Chasing Daylight, sounds a lot like Matchbox 20. It's a lot more rock, but it sort of makes the band lose it's original sound that was a lot rarer on their former cds. It's still a good cd though."
5,I thought I was the only one!!,"""I thought I was the only one,"" is the comment most often uttered when meeting another Betsy-Tacy fan. We make up a tight little society that can't be explained to those who have not read the B-T series and this Companion is a most welcome addition to the body of works. It helped me find the pension in Munich where Betsy stayed and the Casa del'Oro in Venice where she fell in love with Marco, even though we were all pining for Joe Willard. I fed the pigeons in St. Mark's Square just as Betsy did and this delightful, informative book helped in my search. The author has done a painstaking research job and I, for one, know that it was a true labor of love. Sharla has taken her rightful place on my bookshelf right next to all of Maud's other works. I can think of no higher honor."
5,Must reading for every American citizen!,"Read the words that shaped the character of our nation and changed the history of the world. From the rousing Declaration of Independence to the inspiring speeches of our modern presidents, this book has it all. Students and scholars alike will find this an excellent reference tool. This book should be in the hands and minds of every American who loves liberty."
4,Still quite good,"While it does at times suffer from the hipper than thou aspect of any Saturdan Night Live derived series or movie, 30 rock still does have its share of strong moments. The secondary characters are quite strong and even Kenneth does not drive me as crazy as h e used to. Tina Fey is perfect as Lz Lemon and directs a wonderful cast which this year has been augmented by a great number of guest stars. It is still one of the better comedies around."
5,Chloe Grace Moretz!,"I have to say... I heard about this episode on Chloe's twitter. I watched it because she was in it, but I really do like Tina Fey. Let me just say that Chloe was amazing! So entertaining. And oh yeah, the rest was funny too."
3,Definitely the poorest season of 30 Rock,"I was really impressed with 30 Rock. The first few seasons were original and hilarious. Very likable characters and great plot. But then, season 5 came. I don't know if the writers are losing ideas but now they do too much racial and homosexual jokes. I would expect those kind of jokes in other comedies but not from 30 Rock. The characters also became really predictable and. I had the same opinion when I watch them on TV and now that I have watched all 5 seasons again on DVD, I stand firm on my opinion. Let's hope season 6 will return to its roots."
4,great season,30 Rock is getting better with each season....real funny episodesI think 4 and 5 are the best seasons so far
4,30Rock Season 5,"Season 5 was full of surprises, I also felt the show seemed to have lost direction during the season but came back to close well, looking forward to Season 6. AW30 Rock: Season 5"
3,Two Steps Down for Season 5,"Just finished watching all of season 5. It's a major disappointment for me. The first 4 seasons were generally four or five stars, but this season the humor seems forced and, what's worse, rather sophomoric sexual jokes and puns were inserted into the dialogue. I suppose homor is subjective so there is no sense writing a long review--seasons one to four were funny to me; season five was not."
1,Computer kller?,"I love 30 Rock and will someday watch these episodes, but might need a dedicated DVD player. These DVD's not only hang but the codec left a vertical white line staggering back and forth on my monitor ""forever"" -- that is until I impulsively tried a CD from Season four. While the DVD would not run, it fixed the problem caused by playing Season Five.I'm so glad I don't need a new monitor after all.To those who actually watched these, did you use your computer or other equipment. (I watch other DVDs just fine.)"
4,Corner Gas,This show was great!!!I just wish that more people knew about this show. This just gos to show that you don't need a big budget to produce a great show
5,Better than Bond,James Munro is a combination of Ian Fleming and Robert Ludlum. I read this book many years ago and I still remember its opening pages. The book opens with a catastropic event that forces a reluctant man to face incredible challenges.The book is action packed with a lot of surprises. Great suspense as well. I believe that The Man Who Sold Death compares favorably with Trevanian's Eiger Sanction and Loo Sanction written at approximately the same time.This book was the first book in a very realistic espionage series. Since James Munro was one of the Best writer's of this genre from this era it would be a shame for his works to slip into obscurity.Although I liked the early Ian Fleming James Bond Novels I thought James Munro's espionage series was even better. These books are true classics of the 1970's
5,the man who sold death,"I have not had a chance to read the book, but I had read it in the past and found it to be an excellent story, for those who like these books."
3,the complete Victoria de los Angeles,"This 4 CD collection is a must for hard core de los Angeles fans. The recordings are, of course, dated and the quality is not up to modern standards. Still, this amazing voice shines. I bought it for the duets with Fischer-Dieskau (I had the LP years ago) and it was wonderful to hear these again."
1,Piece of Junk,"I have owned three Lexmark printers. My Lexmark laser printer (Oprtra R) was so reliable I didn't even think twice before purchasing a second Lexmark Laser. I hooked the E320 up, tried to print 20 pages of text, and the [stupid] thing jammed. I went over the install instructions again and fanned the paper about 5 times. Jammed again after the third page. I put brand new paper in the machine (unfanned) and it jammed after 4 pages. I finally returnned the printer after 6 hours [working] with it."
5,Satisfied,Not a lot to say other than I am happy with this comforter set. Great price!! This was definitely worth the money
1,Sleep Inducing,"After falling asleep three times while reading this book I decided it was not for me. The worst part is that I could not seam to remember much about it at all, it left that little of an impression on you. The story is just not inventive."
4,"Great product, works great for my white dogs","I purchased this shampoo hoping it would brighten the coat and take away the dirt from the coats of both my white animals. This shampoo did just that. My all white shepard looked slightly dingy and dirty before, but after using the shampoo his coat did get whiter and even shined a bit.I would reccommend it to others."
5,MAKE YOUR WHITE DOG BRITE,I LOVED THE PRODUCT IT MADE MY DOG REAL WHITE AND HE SMELLED GREAT FOR A LONG TIME. I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS SHAMPOO FOR MY DOG CASPER.
4,White as snow!,"This shampoo works good, doesn't lather as well as some I have tried and the smell doesn't last as long as I would like but for it's main purpose, which is getting a white dog white, it works well. Would buy it again."
4,Good dog product,"Wonderful product , It works great on my Maltese/poodle, Bright white is what you get..and is good at removing stains on their coats...."
2,Not Great,"I purchased a bottle for my white malipoo and while it makes her look clean initially, I think after 2 days she gets more dirty than with other shampoos, it's almost as if it make dirt cling more. In addition, she normally has very soft fur when I use the right shampoos, with this product her fur was not at all smooth and soft and was harder to brush. I would not recommend this product"
1,Not High on my list,"I have a Maltese and purchased this shampoo because of his white coat. It did not work well at all, no noticeable change in coats whiteness, and my dog didnt even really smell clean after use. Would not purchase again."
1,Garbage...,"I bought this because my English Bulldog was getting tear stains on her face and paws. After getting the package, I immediately gave her a bath with the shampoo and saw absolutely no difference. I thought that maybe it would work gradually over a little bit of time. Well, It's been a month and I see no results, not even a little. Garbage, IMO."
3,VERY Strong Citrus Smell,"We couldn't use it because the smell was so strong. Our dogs eat raw meat, nuts, and veggies so they smell good naturally no matter how hard they play outdoors. They have no unpleasant 'doggie smell' to mask. We love fresh citrus fruit - and really wanted to like this product - but just could not handle the strong smell."
3,Rotary Table,"Factory supplied handles are too small; turned larger ones on Lathe for better control; should have ""0"" mark done in contrasting paint or darkened numbers on scale (tought to read/see with lathe chuck mounted)."
1,Dr. NeeDLE is absolutely right,"For the record I teach HTML/Javascript, Dreamweaver, Flash, and i-Net+ at New Century. The publishing company sent no email when I forwarded the mistakes that Dr. NeeDLE found to them, other than the generic auto-response.I definately do not recommend this book at all. A free study guide is available at http://www.mcmcse.com/comptia/inet/ik0002guide.shtml, and I strongly recommend students use this site as: #1 its free #2 its accurate #3 covers more topics than this Sybex fiasco."
2,Not really an i-Net+ exam prep,"The book is a solid introduction to the internet, but is not an i-Net+ exam prep. It had all the right chapters, but it didn't cover the subject matter needed or when it was covered it was not in-depth enough. If I only had this book to prep for the exam, I would of had a problem. This is a good example of getting to press first. Now if all you are looking for is an introduction to the i-net then this book was fine, well written and few typos. I was reviewing it to use in a class I am teaching, but because it is an i_net+ exam prep course I will not use it. I would consider it for an introductory class on the internet."
3,Worth Buying - But could be better,"There's a lot of good stuff in this book and it is well organized. The only problem is that it is missing a lot of new information and the associated website does not cover these issues. The book would be much better if it had addendums on the site. Luckily my experience covered the holes. Also, found some errors, but suprisingly, not that many.Personally, I recommend this book, it's well worth it but should not be a sole source of study. Go to freecomptia.com for more recent test questions and seek other sites for supplemental information. Between these two sources, you should do fine.The test provides 90 minutes, I took about 20, so the test is not that difficult. This book certainly made it easier."
2,Not adequated for testing--a good start though.,This is good reference or beginner book for the internet but you won't pass the exam by using only this book. There is a lot of stuff on the exam not covered in this book. My low rating is based on what the book is supposed to prepare you for and it does not fully prepare you. I does have a lot of helpful info though. Read additional books if you want to pass the exam.
4,Supplementary Books/Materials Needed&#65533;,"This book alone is NOT recommended for people who are not from the IT industry.While it does cover a broad range of area, depth is missing in certain areas.Supplement it with another book.About 20% of the exam questions I encountered are not covered by the book OR too detailed for a non-IT person.Good luck!!"
2,4 stars for understanding Internet stuff; 2 for exam related,"I wrote and past the i-Net+ (1K0-002) today (Mar-5-2004). This book contributed 40% of the content.The content of this book is excellent for understanding Internet-related information. However, from the standpoint of the i-Net+ exam the book missed the mark.The book helped with understanding some of the concepts. The practice questions were way way too easy.The exam was hard... damn hard. I passed with a 83% mark."
3,I Net+ 2nd Edition Review,"I recently wrote the I Net+ Exam (New edition) I only used the I Net+ Study Guide by David Groth and Dorthy Mcgee, as my learning material.The book covers about 80% of what is in the new exam, but there is a lot that is left out, If you have no industry experience in this area, I think you may find that this book will not be enough for you to pass the exam.I scored 90% in the exam, but have been working in this area for a few years.I reccomend this book to anyone wanting to write this exam, but if you are just starting out in this field you will need to supplement it with some other material, otherwise you will have difficulty passing."
4,Great book,"Sybex did it again, i think that for any comptia exam you should use a sybex study guide, they prepare you for the exam.Let me add, that you need almost none it experience, it covers like a 90% of the content of the exam."
4,Great!,"Using it for my late talking son,seems to grab his interest for a a good amount of time.Like the product."
4,"A gut-wrenching, bloody trip!","I can tell you without reservation, that this book affected me. And not all the memories were good, either. I did not wantto put it down when I started reading, but some of the scenes and action were hard to get through. I am a former Marine (1965-1969)and a pilot, but I didn't serve in combat. I did see planes crash (one right in front of me) and people were killed. This backgrounddid allow me to empathize with the characters of the book. I recommend this book if you want a hard look at what combat and militaryaviation (helicopters in particular) can entail. You can feel what it might be like to follow orders and at the same time have a gutfeeling that maybe you should be doing something else."
4,New Perspective on Josephus,Gave me a new perspective on Jospehus. I never thought about Josephus as the traitor/Roman loyalist. I could not finish the book because it got way too redundant for me.Otherwise it was very informative.
1,Not the complete works,It appears that this is not a complete work but notes of personal opinion on the book of josephus. I love how this commentator makes assumptions that cannot be verified. Waste of time.
3,Josephus,I haven't looked at it very closely. I thought it was the original Josephus rather than a commentary on it. I am sure it will be useful when I get the time to look at it.
2,Don't believe these reviews!,"It may be due to the fact that I was only 7 when this film premiered, but I found House of Games to be atrocious! The acting was laughable (Lindsay Crouse was dull and wooden, while Montagna's lines came across comically though not usually intended to be so), the plot was entirely transparent (just imagine - getting conned by con men), and the character development left much to be desired.An interesting side-note, however, is that this movie reminds viewers just how much influence tobacco companies had on movie houses back in the '80s. The whole film is one long drag off a Camel, and even Granny happily lights Crouse's cigarettes with her vintage lighter.Do not purchase this movie without first watching it!"
1,hateful poorly directed film,THe key performances are off. THey feel like stage performances rather than cinematic. Im assuming its the direction thats misguided; most of the performances are consistently bad in the same way.The writing is very angry. Like a temper tantrum against human nature.THe depiction of female characters is ugly.the plot is very predictable.
3,"Good, although I was able to predict the surprises","Many years ago, someone recommended this film to me, and I can understand why. It's a clever film, full of surprises as the protagonist psychiatrist is drawn into the world of confidence men, finding herself fascinated by their very different life. Mamet is known for his dialogue, perfected on the stage, that tries to recreate ""normal"" speaking patterns. It might be normal, but it's not necessarily realistic. What I like about it is the quickness of it (something also from the stage), moving on from character to character without necessarily waiting for the audience to follow.Unfortunately, I must have seen enough of these kinds of movies because I was able to predict a number of the surprises, including the major one. Still, I enjoyed the movie and would be willing to see another one by Mamet."
5,House of Games does not disappoint,"Some movies you just don't want to end. That is House of Games. It's got a great cast and trap door story line as shady as the smoke rising from a freshly lit smoke. It's a movie that once you've seen, you want to watch it again to see the act unfold even as you know the answers. And of course the name of the director/writer, says it all. You're in for a good ride."
4,Vintage Mamet,"Vintage Mamet -- more for the stage than the screen, this film's memorable scenes overshadow it's somewhat forced dialogue. No one actually speaks like this, but the same could be said about Shakespeare. Sadly, many people actually do look like Mantegna and Crouse -- not exactly the best ingredients when the recipe calls for steam. (7/10)"
1,very predictable,"I've seen two other Mamet films (Spartan and Redbelt). Although I enjoyed both of these films, I don't understand why this movie has received so much acclaim. Maybe it was because I knew there was a twist (but probably not), I saw it coming, not from the beginning, but it became painfully obvious. I enjoyed the dialogue in the other Mamet films I've seen, but not in this film. Seriously, who says, as they are being shot to death, ""Thank you, sir. Can I have some more?"" (or something to that effect). And once you figure out the con, the color motif becomes obvious and, frankly, uninteresting.A real disappointment."
3,You're ALL right!,"House of Games is a very interesting movie. However, there are things that drive me crazy about it. For some reason, David Mamet's scripts always have people repeating each others questions. This gets really annoying after only 30 minutes. Plus, the acting seems bad because all of the actors seem so emotionally detached from the goings on. They are like teenagers reading from a script, with zero emotion or interest. Then again, maybe it is simply bad acting."
1,Don't direct this film like HE did!,"A few films fall into the catogory of ones that make me want to run from the room kicking and screaming, ""Don't ever direct a film the way this one was!"" Wag the Dog seemed to fall into that category. David Mamet often can't make a career transition from stage work to screen. Lindsey Crouse is as stiff and repulsive as sleazy Joe Montegna is. They perform each scene like they're playing on stage to an audience. Other characters appear to be on projection backdrops along with the cardboard street slum set. Oh, and believability. Montegna can steal a key to use a first class hotel room without the bell boy or maid coming up to clean their room and find new guests there. He can spend the night there with Crouse. She will make sure each intimate line is heard in the back row. His con men gamble with a squirt gun! Wouldn't an empty pistol bluff just as easy? The scenes focus solo on two characters even in crowded rooms--no sound blends the others in."
5,Great movie,"I bought this as a gift because I saw the movie when it first came out. It is an excellent movie with great actors. The plot is intriguing. If you haven't seen it, I would recommend you buy this."
2,boring movie,"didn't care for the movie it was weird and boring, would not recommend anyone to watch it. You don't know until u watch it."
4,Very Good film!!,"If you like films like ""The Game"", films that you don't know where the lies end and the truth starts, films that keep you on your seat, THEN you should absolutely buy this one.It's a really good thriller!"
4,Overrated but worth watching,"The Bottom Line:House of Games is for the most part an intriguing thriller about confidence men which shouldn't be terribly predictable even if you've seen a lot of these types of films, but it flies off the rails in the final act (when a character says ""Thank you sir may I have another"" I was rolling my eyes very hard) and Mamet could certainly have used a better actress in the lead than Lindsay Crouse (aka Mrs. Mamet); House of Games is a decent movie but the director's later effort The Spanish Prisoner takes similar ideas and does them much better.3/4"
4,more like 4.5,"Quite a clever thriller, and one which adds up to more than the sum of its parts. Filmed in my hometown of Seattle!"
5,House of Games,House ofGames is an excellent film directed by David Mamet. The choppy dialogue is intriguing and the story riveting. Another in the long list of great Mamet films Highly recommend
4,Stand does what it is supposed to do,This is a really nice and sturdy crossbow stand. It does exactly as it is supposed to do. The only issue is that the hooks are a little close together so it can take a few more seconds to get in and out of the stand. It works really well and I would recommend this stand to anyone who needs one.
5,Quo And The Blues,"This is a excellent blues style album by this great rock band.The Dog of Two Head album is a pre commercialised album from the Quo and is a truly awesome piece of work.The songs are great and well produced with great guitar tones and sound. The content takes on a heavy blues feel with plenty twelve bar rocking numbers and I rate it in my top ten albums of all time much the pity the band are not making albums of this quality in this day and age. If you like this band and dont have this album you are missing out get the remastered edition you wont regret it, also check out Ma Kellys Greasy Spoon album another pre commercialised blues album from the Quo classic guaranteed.Highly recommend both these albums.Cheers."
3,Dog Of Two Head-Status Quo,I could go on and on about the legendary Status Quo-music style-influence-favourite songs etc. But instead I just want to say: Heard an 'oldie' the other day whilst driving-turned radio up-played pretend drums on steering wheel and sang along! Went immeadiately to amazon feeling good in search of more!
4,Another classic to add to the list.,"Dara has always been one of my favorite DnB DJ's of all time. Once again, he hits us with an onslaught of great American Drum and Bass tunes. Right off the bat, he starts off with a deep roller from a guy named ICR. ICR also appears on track number 5. Both of these tunes are the highlights of the mix, but you can be sure that the rest is pounding bass and tight breaks. Dara moves through a Drum and Bass spectrum with songs from DJ Abstract, G13, and Dune, just to name a few. This CD has been in my car stereo for about 72 hours and I can't wait to hear it again. Dara.....Keep em' comin'."
4,Tight,"This is a solid release from Dara, full of fast-paced new school dnb to get you moving, not to mention it's only 7 bucks, so it's a steal. If you're looking for some dirty dirty jungle, though, this isn't the album to buy. If you want some high quality, rolling, clean American dnb, look no further. Can't get better than Dara."
1,A very very bad game,"...This game is very boring, it is the worst game I have ever played, the money is so slow. The people so weird, and the graphics are the worst in the world."
4,YOU are the Golf Course Tycoon!,"Being both an avid golfer and a Sim-Game buff, I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time. So far this game is worth the money! You can dream up a course, design it, and build it.I like that you can go into a ""CAM"" and fly around and look at everything from just about any angle.If you thought that Activision couldn't make a great ""Tycoon"" game because -Fast food tycoon- and -ski resort tycoon- were mediocre, you should buy this game to get your money's worth for all three of those games.*PROS: Good graphics, easy to learn, good tutorial, loads of options to build structures, and very good price! *CONS: A little too easy to pick up, no actual manual just a jewel case insert with some explanation on the already obvious controls, only a few zoom levels, and no speed adjust."
2,Ok but still BAD,"I find this game interesting but not that fun. Activition did a great job on other games, but on this one crashed and burned. Activition found a fascinating topic but no real story line. I played Ski Resort Tycoon before but this one was different. I don't know why but I found that Ski Resort Tycoon more interesting. You don't see Golf Tycoon having Movie Theaters. I think this time Activision. was focosing more on the elderly folk. Other than that I think this game was..........ok."
2,Ok Game,The games is ok but for some reason it runs very slow. If you have a fast computer you will enjoy it but if you have a slower computer you may not enjoy it like me!.
5,"The natural companion to Steele's Common Lisp, the language","Lisp provides an incredible amount of programming concepts. All the concepts are described in Steele's monumental ""Common Lisp, the language"" or the newer hypertext version on the web. The one gripe I have with Steele's book is that it lacks examples. Sthepen Slade provides all the examples of common usage that Steel might have provided."
2,"Not a bad introduction for the beginner, but very poorly titled.","The book has one chapter on CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, pretty much the same as any other Lisp tutorial. As such, the title is very misleading, and the reader expecting an in-depth treatment of object-oriented programming in Common Lisp will be very disappointed. This book isn't bad, but Peter Seibel's excellent Practical Common Lisp is better in pretty much every respect. If you still want a dedicated book on CLOS, Sonya Keene's ""Object Oriented Programming in Common Lisp"" is a much better tutorial, and Kiczales' ""The Art of the Metaobject Protocol"" is a wonderful treatment of the CLOS internals, though not for the faint of heart."
5,Great product & fast service,"Thanks so much for getting the album to me so quickly. Amazon doesn't gaurantee 1-3 day delivery on outside vendors, but this vendor was very prompt and it got to me in 3 days! Thanks again!"
3,somewhat helpful,"Product has not been as handy as I had hoped it would be. Instructions are merely a picture. I don't know how to keep it from popping off the shuttle occationaly, as the thread catches it. It does make it easier to hold the shuttle....if you can keep it on the shuttle. It is in the path of the quick moving thread and catches sometimes. My skills in this area are developing, so it could be my coordination is not the best.Novice tatter"
3,shuttel winder,"I'm loving it , I got a victorian tatting shuttle for Christmas and with out the winder it distroyed the thread . It makes winding so easy . Thank you"
3,Easy acccess!,"The Easy Lock Velco ankle brace is easy to get on, softer, and more comfortable than the lace-up. However, it does not fit as snuggly nor hold the ankle as securely as the lace up. I alternate depending on my activity."
2,A good read but forgettable,"While reading this book, I enjoyed the suspense and the setting (San Francisco). But in the three weeks (and several other completed books) since I finished it, I completely forgot the entire story. Reading the summary brought it back, but not enthusiastically. Being my first Lescroart book, I thought I might pick up another for the setting in SF rather than my attachment to his characters."
3,Not very exciting,"This is the first novel by this author I have read. The story was okay, the presentation was a little lame. I like a little more action and excitment in my stories. It's not that the plot was weak or the story was poorly told, it just lacked life. When I get to the end of a chapter I like the author to compel me to continue reading the next chapter. I found that lacking in this book. When i finished one chapter, I was neither curious nor excited to see what the next chapter would bring.This book is basically about a man accused of murder, the people trying to prove his guilt and those trying to prove his innocence. The end of the book gets better and has a much quicker pace.All in all, this is not a bad or competely boring book, it just doesn't grab you and keep you riveted. Don't expect your pulse to quicken or to suffer from sleep deprivation. I would, however be willing to give another of his novels a try."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I had never read any of Lescroart's works before ""The Hearing"". I picked it up in an Airport book store, and read it on a cross-country flight. I couldn't put it down. I've read the less positive Amazon reviews, and, yes, there's some merit to criticism that some of the readers have meted out. All the same, ""The Hearing"" is an page-turner. I give it 5 stars for its shear entertainment value.BTW: After reading ""The Hearing"", I went back and read the ""The Oath"" and the ""The 13th Juror"". I'm afraid I found those clumsily written. Did Lescroart get a new editor with the ""The Hearing""?"
2,Mediocre,"I thought this book was mediocre at best. The characters were presented well and made for an interesting cast; however, the central mystery of the book is not quite resolved. Lingering questions remain at the end of the book.Additionally, the book takes several detours to explore the family life of some of the characters. Several of the detours work to enhance the novel's plot, but others seem rather pointless. If I'm reading a legal thriller, I'd prefer to read a legal thriller, not an exploration of family life. If I wanted to read an exploration of child-rearing and family life, I'd be reading that, not a legal thriller."
3,works well good tool,"It does what it suppose to do. Thats what you want. it could use a longer hose, but a extension can be made. It gets a positive review."
5,Basic and Effective,"I needed to check operating pressures on a new build and this did the job perfectly. It could only be better if it had a longer hose that had steel braid, but then the price would not be so affordable. Anyhoo, it works great for me."
3,Decent Product,"It works but not a professional grade product which is ok because the price did not reflect that it was a professional grade product. I would reccommend trying to find one with quick disconnects or at least a swivel. It was awkward installing it as the hose and gauge had to be rotated with the fitting as I tried to thread it into the tranny and could not actually see the hole. Again, not a bad product. If you plan to use it once, maybe twice ever, go for it. If you are a mechanic, get a better one..."
4,trans pressure gauge,"The product worked as described. Nice supply of adapters as well. Good product for the price, and it arrived on time with no troubles."
3,Flawed surface,I ordered this product because of its size and price. When we recieved the product there was a sharp area/scratch on the right side near the handle. The left upper corner felt like they sprayed the nonstick coating over sand. We returned the first one and recieved a replacement. Unfortunatly the second one had the exact same flaws. Obviously a manufacturing and quality control issue. We requested a refund and will buy a different brand.I applaud Amazon for their hassle free response in returning the items. I notified them of the desire to return for a replacement and the next day when UPS picked up the old one they already had the replacement. Great customer service by Amazon.
5,Excellent Griddle,This griddle was worth the money spent. Large surface allows you to cook for a large family and the no stick surface is amazing.
3,Griddle,Cook's Illustrated gave this griddle top marks in their review.Could not find in Canada so I ordered it thru Amazon. Shipping and duty made it a $140 item. My expectation were high. The item arrived with a small scratch in the surface and having used it for 2 months I am overall pleased. It does take 10 min to get to temperature of 300 and it is not evenly hot. Cool area near the plug and hotter the further you are away from the plug.Would not buy an item like this on line again as there is no way to return or inspect before purchaseBroil King USG-10G Ultra Large Griddle
4,"Excellent! Large is an understatement, heats up quickly, cooks evenly.","Having had two other crappy griddles I can honestly say this one is wonderful. It's large, it's extremely deceiving when you just read ""large"" this thing is huge. I find that it warms up quickly, cleans easily, cooks evenly, and appears sturdy. The non-stick surface doesn't seem cheap and thin. It's been holding up quite well since I purchased it a few months ago. I also cook on it nearly daily and I can cook eggs, bacon, and pancakes on the weekend in one shot that's how big this thing is."
1,not worth the money,"The Broil King Ultra Large Griddle is the worst griddle I have ever bought. It doesn't even look like the picture advertised on Amazon, plus the nonstick coating was scratched. It does not cook evenly, half the griddle burns and the other is still raw. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Uneven heating,I do not recommend this product at all. I'm on my second and found the side opposite the thermostat heats up to over 100 degrees hotter then the side next to the thermostat. Avoid this product.
2,Broil King,To say my griddle cooks a tad unevenly would be an understatement. The two sides are way off! That's ok for bacon. (I like mine crisp and hubby likes his underdone) The temp difference on the two ends are not good for pancakes. I bought one of these for my folks too and they have the exact same problem with theirs. I've tried contacting Broil King - no reply!On a more positive note: Love the large cooking space. Size is excellent as long as you have the storage space.
2,Eventual dissapointment,"I too have had problems with this, but was set to purchace another until I read the reviews here. I use it primarily for it's FM *reception* and not for broadcast abilities. There are LOTS of choices for *that*. I agree that it requires the earsets for broadcast transmission and of course you'd need them to receive FM (or you'd never know what you're not hearing!).The unit worked flawlessly for over a year and then without incident it developed an issue with refusing to turn on. About one day in three or four it'll work. On the others it comes on then immediately shuts itself off. The other negative reviewers were not specific enough for me to determine if this was the same issue they were experiencing.For now, I'll look for an alternative adapter for FM reception."
1,Works well for a week then dies,I bought one and when I first plugged it in was unimpressed. It was weak & full of static. Then I plugged in the headphones and was crystal clear. It needs them as an antennae. It also was unhappy when the ipod wasn't fully charged. It then died after a week so I returned it. Interesting idea but way too fragile. Now I need an new transmitter but they all seem to have problems.
2,It was awesome until It died!!,"The Nanotune is awesome and I loved that I could take it everywhere, but it died after the second week of having it. I have exchanged it once before since it died a week after, now it died again. I wish I can find the manual to get my money back. It won't last if you buy it. Get some thing that holds it in place. The velcro that came with it slipped right off and it kept falling all over my car when I slowly went over a speed bump. Do not buy!"
2,I got screwed,"My CD showed up and it had two copies of the DVD in it with the same two songs on both, I didn't get a CD... Guess I have to contact somebody"
2,outdated and clumsy edition,"The book certainly offers some practical advice, but its terribly outdated. Actually, it is from 1957, so you learn how to quickly calculate on which day every day of the week fell in that year. Or how to remember phone numbers in a 1957 format (much shorter than today). I doubt that many people really are eager to demonstrate they can remeber a whole deck of cards, but the book spends a lengthy chapter on that subject. And the Kindle edition is terrible. Charts are unreadable, the pictures to which the text refers non-existent. But it's only a bit more than three dollars, and if you want some memory tricks, for that money there is no reason not the buy this book, because memory tricks it certainly offers."
2,Very poor editing for the Kindle version,"*This is a review of the Kindle version*Someone did a horrible job at converting it into a Kindle version. The text is full of typos and ""left overs"" from the scan/OCR process (such as headers and page numbers appearing in the middle of the text). And charts and tables are just a mess, really confusing. Really a pity, because the book is an easy and enjoyable read."
5,"Awsome, simply wonderful!!!","I read the first one the same day that I bought it and couldn't even put it down until I was finished. I then bought the second one and can't wait until the next one is released in Canada. I started playing the PS2 games and was instantly hooked as well. This lead to me buying the .hack//sign series and there I was instanly entranced, the anime is simply beautiful and amazing. I personaly loved all of it and although these are series that not every one would enjoy I still recommend watching/reading/playing and you never know, you might become hooked just like me."
5,kewl,I bought the first and second book to this series and i just love it! The drawings are so cute! *huggles her manga*
2,Definitely not for beginners,"Potential buyers could easily be misled by its title into thinking that this book is for beginners, which it certainly is not. It's a reference book which assumes you already know HTML reasonably well, and consists mainly of formal syntax listings of HTML tags with their arguments and a few examples. It has over 700 pages because the argument definitions are reprinted for EACH tag, some literally hundreds of times, a huge waste of paper. It would be much more useful to spend a few more pages on the index and print larger than its 6-point type, since you have to refer to it constantly due to the book's rather arbitrary organization scheme."
5,The best HTML reference book for the best price.,"This book has all the HTML information I need and costs less than most other HTML/basic website design. It IS written in PLAIN ENGLISH, which is refreshing. Finding the information you need to solve a particular HTML problem is quite easy. If you are only going to buy one HTML book, but this one."
5,Excellent - Buy this book is you use HTML,Excellent reference. I keep it open on my desk whenever I'm working with HTML. Gives you everything you need to know and is organized very well. If there is any criticism it is that you may be overwhelmed by the amount of info provided!
2,"If this is plain english, I'd hate to read technical.","This is a good reference source if you know basic HTML programming and want to look up a particular tag or element. As a ""plain english"" guide for novices, it utterly fails. Poorly laid out, little intro material, the book primarily provides a laundry list of HTML code for mid-level experienced web-designers. Also, no pictures. I thought the web was about graphics."
1,disney bed thing,horrible.......too big for the twin bed.......flopped all over then it was alsmost impossible to get it back into the box to return.............sent it back......hope you got it
2,Customer service is terrible,"I bought this for my 4 year old as a cute temporary bed untill I get her a real bed as the above review says it doesnt fir over a headboard and foot board as I originally thought, whish wasnt that bad I guess you just use a twin size bed frame. Mine was missing a pole, and I tried for several days to contact customer service and as of today have still not got anywhere. The bed topper is cute and pretty cheap and should last a while if your child is over the age of 4."
3,not too sturdy,"My girls love it so much that they now sleep in the same bed. But I am still a little confused as to if I use a boxspring or not, and they have played so hard that the stiching on one side has come undone a tiny bit. But this tiny bit is enough to make the whole thing be lopsided. Other than that it's great."
5,Very soigné,"Headquarters seems to have this rather unique gift of genious that makes you say that everything they do is outstanding (Movie, website, CD). In this perspective their CD-soundtrack has got that specific blend of sound from the '60's that you'd expect, plus with that subtle twist to make it sound very actual. They know what they're talking about, and know their classics in order to brew their own ""soigné"" sound that fits the Mod scene as a tonic suit. I just can't wait to hear more music from them or to see them live."
5,Buy this album!,"if you like the Beatles, this is the album for you. It's a classic, and one of my favorites. You can't not love this album."
3,"Good book, bad binding","I was assigned 'Readings' for a graduate class in cultural theory. Created as a companion to 'A History of Anthropological Theory,' which examines the context and historical characters involved in the creation of anthropological theory, this book has a good selection of key excerpts and theoretical articles from across a range of time and theories.My main critique is not of the book itself, but of the binding and layout. As I read my first article, the binding cracked and several pages began to peel up from the binding - an unhappy surprise! In addition, the pages have very small, close text, making it difficult to read and leaving little room for notes. Many of these texts are available in other books or academic databases, so you might consider the older edition or an alternate text - not because the texts are inadequate, but because the binding and layout of this edition may not stand up to serious study."
5,Great Album!,Very hard to find album so I didn't mind paying a little extra when searching for this for the hubby's bday. I haven't heard this CD in forever but it is great!
1,WHAT IS THE UNITED STATES' AND THE WEST'S REAL PROBLEM WITH BELARUS?,"The United States vilification of President Alexander Lukashenko and Belarus has nothing to do with ""democracy"" and ""human rights."" Lukashenko's refusal to surrender Belarus to U.S./E.U. capitalist domination via privatization and criticism of U.S. policies have infuriated Washington. Even more irksome to the White House, IMF, and World Bank is that Lukashenko's economic model is actually working!!!For accurate and objective information on President Lukashenko and pre and post Soviet Belarus I highly recommend Stewart Parker's new book, ""The Last Soviet Republic - Alexander Lukashenko's Belarus."" The reader will receive a huge amount of well researched, objective material that contradicts and debunks the stereotypical drivel and propaganda written by Washington's hacks."
1,For experts on the subject only,"A.E. Waite could have spend his time better than translating this ""French masterpiece"". As always Eliphas Levi is ill-informed and doesn't care much about facts. The book is full of factual errors and Alphonse Louis Constant shapes history as it suits him. This doubtful ""History of Magic"" is therefore only interesting for uncritical followers of the master, reseachers who specialize in the history of occultism in the nineteenth century or for experts on the history of magic in general who can make distinctions between facts and non-sense. It is more or less misleading to rate this book five stars."
3,Sheshebazar,"The part about India being described as ""the Mother of all heresies"" where the reviewer above writes that this is: ""[laughable, were it not so pathetic an example of judeochristian resentiment]"" is actually right on the money from the perspective of a Western Esotericist and Esoteric Christian who is aware that the entire Pantheistic Diaspora of Indian deities are one and the same with the 200 Fallen Angels of Christianity."
5,Pacing is Crucial,"Of all the recordings (and live performances) I have heard of the Carmina, this one flows the best. Conductors are always varying pace & tempo in this work, but Stowkowski got it just right. The harmonic coloring and gender-moods are also excellent. This is the one to own."
5,Love the camera--terrible experience with Amazon,"I love this camera and find it very easy to use and finally have the pictures I want--but trying to buy it from Amazon was a nightmare.There was a huge delay in shipping--and after several e-mails telling to expect delivery on x, then y, then z date I tried to cancel the order because I was going to be out of town on the last delivery date that was sent to me.There is no phone number to call, you must e-mail Amazon and request a phone call for customer service. Then, every time I talked to someone I was given a different answer.Even though the camera had not shipped and wasn't expected to ship, they refused to cancel my order.I had to refuse delivery from UPS and have my credit card refunded.For the price, I expect much better customer service. Luckily, I found the customer service I looking for at [..]."
5,Definetely Helpful,"I'm a Hipnotherapist and this book has some great ideas and suggestions to use in hipnosis, principally if you are starting your career and you need to know more about issues related with the phisical body"
5,Bible of hypnosis,"If you want to dicover hypnosis, it's probably not the first book you should get. But if you want to go futher on this topic or if your work in this feild, it's a must have."
2,FROSTY,The freezer builds up too much frost and doesn't keep things frozen. One side freezes and the other side doesn't.
3,waiting,The freezer works fine but I'm still waiting for the freight company to inspect the damage so I can get the credit..good ol' UPS (I mean OOPS)
5,Fascinating story of a remarkable woman,"Dr. Carroll has again done a magnificent job of making history interesting. His portrayal of Isabel is gripping, his scholarly foundation is excellent, and his style is highly readable. I especially appreciated his comments on the Spanish Inqisition - a viewpoint you won't hear from most historians! Isabel is one of the most admirable women figures in the history of the world, and an excellent model for all women concerned with true feminism. Her humanity, intelligence, compassion, wisdom and courage are inspiring. Thank you, Dr. Carroll, for your service to the truth in bringing her so vividly to life."
5,Perfect for all ages!,"Great fun for all ages. One of the all-time best animated movies, with excellent animation, voices, and direction. Doesn't preach or pander to any one audience, but has moments that are fun for adults (check out the ""Atomic Holocuast"" movie-within-the-movie) and kids-- It is my 2-year old's favorite movie as well, and I suspect it will remain so for years to come."
4,Fun family movie,A great older family style animated flick that speaks to the open mindedness of children and their ability to see the good in all things inherently.Con-Definitely did not enjoy the military agent character for his brazen actions and how it reflects poorly on the military brass.Although how he treats the main character is disgustingly obvious of certain clandestine agencies.
4,Great Family Movie,My 5 yr. old Grandson loves this movie! A co-worker (her kids are 3 and 4 loved it so I bought it!) It's the only movie I have ever seen him sit through start to finish!
4,Surprisingly funny,"I got this movie simply to go with my Vin Diesel dvd collection. I didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be. When the agent got his head slammed in the bathroom door I nearly fell off the couch laughing -- just one of several really funny scenes. I just flat out liked this little flick. Even sniffed a bit at the ending and it's a cartoon for goodness sakes!Something good you can see with your family. Hey, what more can you ask for??ps-If you're getting this simply as a Diesel fan, don't. Get it because it's a genuinely good movie."
4,Kids love it. A good story about choosing to be & do good.,"There are a few moments that might frighten very little kids, but this is high quality animation and a great story."
5,Best Animation of '99,"Surprisingly, WB surpassed Disney this year! If you have seen both ""The Iron Giant"" and the ""Tarzan"", I am pretty sure that you would agree with me and say ""The Giant is a lot better"". First of all, ""The Iron Giant"" has its own artistic style. It is different, it's stunning, and it's successful. Both the 3-D compuater animation and the traditiona 2-D artworks were outstanding and brilliant. Most importantly, ""The Iron Giant"" has a very touching story. You would have the sympathy for the ""big metal guy"", but you will also laugh at some plots. ""The Iron Giant"" is the best animation of the year undoubtfully, and I recommend it with enthusiasm."
5,excellent,"one of the best animation movies, as good as any disney movie pree 2000. Brad bid make a sequel please"
5,Destined to be a classic!!!!!,"I have just loved The Iron Giant after seeing it in theatres 5 years ago. With it's heart, wit and engrossing story, it far surpasses anything to come out of Disney or Dreamworks. It truly is a pity that Warner Bros. did not promote it better than they did. A definite must for any DVD collection with tons of enjoyment for both the kids and the parents."
5,Great Entertainment,"Wonderful animation and story of an alien robot giant that comes to earth. My reviewer's group and I enjoyed the animation, story (government and military theme), characters, and also the humor. Good entertainment for the family (premature ending may be too emotional for younger ones but story rectifies that with a believable and good final ending scene). We give it five stars!"
5,Great,Very cheap price. My son loves robots and this was a great movie for any kid who loves robots. It's a feel good movie any toddler would love. Great movie.
5,Iron Giant,"This was my daughter's favorite movie when she was a child who is now 14 - we were wathcing ""Jack Frost"" on VHS the other night and there was an advertisement at the beginning of the movie for ""The Iron Giant"" and her eyes lit up and she said ""do you rememeber this movie, mom"" - how could I forget - so I bought it for her for Christmas - I will be able to give her back a small piece of her childhood - how many gifts can do that?"
5,good movie for kids,"My younger grandkids (boy 7, girl 5) both love this movie, they watched the VHS version over and over until the VCR ate the tape, so had to get the DVD. Nice story about friendship and loyalty."
2,The Iron Giant,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I assumed that a DVD produced in 1999 would be in Dolby Digital 5.1, but the menu didn't give any alternative to the stereo default, and the stereo sound was poor quality at best. As a result, the poor stereo recording resulted in ghost images (if you have external speakers) that were very distracting throughout the movie. Save your money and purchase the VHS instead."
2,Mom is disappointed in movie,"We bought this movie for our sons with high hopes of it being a good movie. Our boys are ages 7 and 3 and it wasn't your typical animated movie, this was really boy stuff. We hooked it up on the TV in our car for a long road trip and were very upset to hear mild profanity during the movie. We think that many parents do not allow profanity of any type and will not want their children to watch this movie. We wish we would have known and now do not watch the movie."
1,One of the worst movies ever,THis was boring from beginnning to end. I can't understand whey anyone like it. I can't reccommend it. Not good for kids or adults.
1,Not that great !,"I watched this and sat through it based purely on the review rating. Thee was absolutely nothing in this that grabbed me, The animation was less than stellar. The story was predictable. It's your basic boy tries to save misunderstood monster story. I don't think it's worth your time."
1,Hmm.. too much brain washing...,I really do not like movies that try to tell me how to think. Movies that try to influence kids on political ideology are completely revolting.
4,Iron Giant Review,"My son loves this movie, and I did, too, but there are two instances where adult language is used. I'm not sure why the makers felt the need to use such strong language in a cartoon. My son loves the ""Giant"" and there is a great storyline, so we'll watch it again, and again."
5,not just for kids,this film is for everyone and i think everyone should see it. i was a bit sceptical on watching it at first but i am glad i finally submitted to the pressures of peers. i highly recommend this cartoon that has laughs and a great message.
5,review,this movie was so good i wanted to watch it again.it was well made and a great story.it had a good storyboard.
4,"Entertaining, quality movie","This movie was a big hit for my 3 and 5 year old boys. I was initially concerned the theme of the movie might be too advanced or portions of the movie too scary, but both seemed to understand and enjoy it.This movie can be enjoyed by young and old alike, at different levels. The animation quality is very good as well."
3,Let's Not Get Too Excited,"Iron Giant suffers somewhat from pacing (muvh as 'The Matrix' does), but this is really one of the only minor flaws in the movie (besides some of the boy's lines which I found a bit irritating, as if someone from Fox animation decided to script a scene for him).Anyways, I won't be long with this review, I don't want to repeat what's already been said.I will mention that 'Iron Giant' sets up the mood as well as any of WB's other better works (I'm pointing at 'Batman' right now). The first scene where the boy meets the robot is undeniably electrifying (no pun intended to those who've seen the movie). Again, it's not as good as I had hoped it would be but it deserves a place along other great animated works, like 'Jungle Book' or that other movie."
2,Eh-,"Well I knew this product was used and had that this DVD was in good condition. But everytime I play it, it will have a still picture with 15 min. of the movie and I have to skip a scene of everytime. I think I will be reading more reviews and feedbacks when I buy next time. Buying wasnt worth it."
4,Very entertaining movie.,"This is the type of wondrous film that I yearned for as a kid. I still enjoyed it as an adult. The story is predictable at times, and a little bit simplified for the children in the audience. Yet it still gets to you, and makes you wide eyed and young at heart.Extremely young children might not quite get the ending, so parents might be advised to screen it first (at the worst, they will probably end up seeing a film THEY liked)."
5,Iron Giant,Very cute. We don't see enough of this kind of entertainment. Good for the child in all of us.
3,"Kids Show, of course.",I got this to watch with my grandchildren who thought it as great. I felt it was OK but it did have a little boy who teamed up with a hippy outcast against the establishment.
4,Very good movie!,My 8 yr old son and I watched this movie on a snow day. We both really enjoyed it!! I recommend.
4,good movie,it is a cute movie and the grandson liked it. i did notice that he lost intrest several times during the slow parts.
5,Kicks Disney's @ss!,"This is the finest animation on the North American Continent. The voice acting of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., and Vin Deisel make this an outstanding addition to anyones DVD library. The animation is truely fantastic in-the-sense-that a ""Gun"" would have a soul and have feelings. This movie is great for young people and older people. People who knew the 50's Cold War will really enjoy the way this movie pokes fun at how bad the propaganda used to be. You need to see this movie."
4,Cute movie.,My son who is four years old is obsessed with this movie. He acts out different parts & knows the main character's name. We rented it from library so many times we decided it was time to buy for his birthday.
4,"An extra star for children, 3 stars for adults","Its a feature length animated film which movies pretty quickly. The animation is really wonderful to watch with the intermingling of the 3 dimensional CGI Robot with the 2 Dimensional storyboards. The film moves fast and at the expense of character development which adults will notice pretty quickly. The movie has a couple of inside jokes for parents but not like other ""adult"" animated films which has you watching closely for all the gags - so it works better for watching with children. It gets an extra star for the kids but for adults in my view i would probably rate it a notch down."
3,Outlandish for todays kids,"Our family and visiting children (5 in total) watched this movie. It was rather entertaining and had one of the viewers asking the question what is the morale of the movie? The destruction of the giant robot in the end robbed the children of the hope that is usually surplanted in other more popular animation movies. One viewer thought that it was noble for the robot to seek to give his ""life"" for the sake of a community. Nevertheless, the artwork could be better based on the newer styles in vogue today. A good entertaining movie, that every family should add to the classical collection."
1,obnoxious sound,"This is one of those movies you constantly change the volume from one extreme to the other.It either startles you or you can't hear it, no medium ground whatsoever I watched about 15 minutes of it and chose another movie. My brother would like it as he generally listens to everything too loud!"
1,"Political Anti: Gun, Hunting, Military, War Informercial","Anti Gun, Anti Hunting, Anti Military, Anti War Informercial. That aside I still do not think the story or the animation was that great. It is a PG as it should be because it is not suitable for young children."
1,The Iron Giant,I give one star for the fact of cartoon . Kids may be interested in such a movie . But I personally cant hack it.
5,Iron Giant is GREAT,My grandson (2) and my granddaughter (12) both loved this movie. Thank you for having it and selling at a good price. Again thank you!
5,I Love This Movie!!!,"I rented this movie in response to all the great reviews of Brad Bird's new movie ""The Incredibles"". All I can say is if ""The Incredibles"" is a wonderful as ""The Iron Giant"" I may not be able to stand it!!!! It's much better than lots of ""live-action"" movies I've seen. There's everything I love in a movie - laughs, a few tears and a story that has a point. It's set in 1957 and deals ostensibly with cold-war politics and fear of that nuclear bomb attack that was coming any day from The USSR (the ""duck and cover"" movie that Hogarth's class had to watch brought back memories!)but it also says a lot about the awful tendancy we have to judge anything ""different"" as bad, dangerous and only worthy of destruction. I recommend this movie to adults - maybe more than children. It reminds us of a lesson we forget too easily - especilly these days - in a very enjoyable way."
5,Flawless Entertainment,"My kids may have watched this disc enough to provide the first documented case of DVD ""laser-rot"". What's even more amazing is that I'm not sick of watching it with them over and over. The Giant has got to be the best fantasy-film/sci-fi character since E.T."
5,The Power Of Friendship,"Heart-warming, feel-good, child-centered parable which delivers a message about anti-violence and hope. Military stereotyping generated discussion. Excellent animation. Contains violence which is relevant to telling the story. Enjoyed the rural Maine setting. The children felt sorry for the Iron Giant. Some kids were glued to the screen. ""Hogarth was afraid of the Iron Giant, but he saved him anyway."" ""It showed how to be friendly to someone who is different from you."" Best for ages 8 to 12."
5,From a dad's perspective,"My 22-month-old son has been absolutely obsessed with this movie for two weeks now. He begs for it every night when he comes from from day care and we always wind up giving in. If it were almost any other animated film, I'd be pulling my hair out by now, but this movie is so well-made and devoted to its characters that it holds up even after a ridiculous number of viewings. I have a ton of respect for the people who made this film and was sad to read that it was a commercial flop - it deserved so much more."
5,The Iron Giant,"This movie is a classic, always a must watch. My kids love it and are always real focased, entertained and quiet while the movie is on. You can never go wrong with your decision on this one. Perfect and I would rate it a 10+."
5,Very cute cartoon,"I didn't know that this movie was all cartoon, however, it is very endearing and sweet. The ""good"" guys win and the ""bad"" guys get their just desserts. Fun."
5,Great for kids and adults,"Movie is still awesome, great redo of original story, perfectly crafted characters. Just awaiting the sequel Mr. Bird! ....Still waiting...."
5,Mom & son loved it.,Iron Giant is film that my 10 year old son and I equally enjoyed. At first he was a little afraid of the movie but he soon warmed to it--now it's one of his favorites. Terrific film by Brad Bird. I highly recommend it.
5,My little boy loves this movie,"We've watched this movie SO many times recently. He loves the ""Giant Robot"" movie as he calls it. Good thing we don't mind it either. It is set in the 1950s we believe. It is about a robot crashing near a small town and the consequences of his arrival. Vin Diesel voices the robot!"
5,Love this movie.,"Sweet and funny aren't the usual words to describe a giant alien, but they are for this particular giant. I watch this movie several times a year, and my children are grown and out of the house. ( they each have their own copy of ""Iron Giant"" and have shared it with college friends. I highly recommend it !"
5,The best animated movies not produced by Disney,"The plot offers such sweet irony you don't get from any other animated movies. You get a robot movie, but no future nor space wars involved. The story is so carefully written that such difficult theme is easily absorbed by any children. The friendship bonded between Hogarth and The Robot instantly infects you.Lately, not even Disney can craft a story so touching. Rereleasing this movie may remind Disney what they were used to be."
5,The Best Cartoon Film EVER,This is hands down my all time favorite cartoon movie. I LOVE this movie. I saw it in the theatre with my little brother when it first came out and I have always loved it since. My only regret now is that I did not buy any of the toys back then. I want them for my son but they are all $100+ now and scarce. My son loves robots and the iron giant is a cut above all other robots.
4,Recommended for all,Animation and story line enhance the original story. Message of moving past fear and war is a strong incentive to view.
5,great movie,My grandkids received this for Christmas and they love it. They have watched it several times in the past week. It is a really sweet movie.
5,Love This Movie!,"This movie is so underrated. Amusing, smart work by Brad Bird before he became known for The Incredibles. My 3.5 year old talked about it for days after watching."
5,Grandsons love it,"Grandsons ages 8 and 6 can't get enough of this movie! Good movie...actually good values, nice conflict resolution situations, etc."
5,The kids liked it!,"My gage is the kids on this. They liked it, so a 5 it gets. There were no issues with buffer pauses, which sometimes is a problem with other services."
5,Deserves your attention,"This movie had the kiss of death: an animation feature film *not* made by Disney. It deserved far more attention than it got. Part a magical children's story, part glimpse of 1950s anti-communist hysteria, this movie is wonderfully rendered, especially in terms of animation, characterization and dialogue. This movie is funny and far more meaningful than the usual tripe Disney dishes out these days."
5,Probably the MOST UNDERATED Animated Film of the Century!,"Of all the great animation films to ever grace the movie screen, the Iron Giant is possibly one of THE best kept secret ever. Although the animation is not as technically stunning as some Disney films, the story is simply moving, bravely written, and imaginative... simply a top-notch film! Young or old, its a definite must-see!"
5,Simply the BEST animated film of the 90's.,"THE IRON GIANT (1999) is so wonderful, so full of magic, so heart-warming, the film is one of the BEST movies (not just animated) to come out in years. Academy, please take note when you cast your ballot. Warner Bros. did a terrible job in selling this magnificent film in theatres last summer. Those people who did see THE IRON GIANT were touched by it, thrilled by it, BLOWN AWAY by it. THE IRON GIANT will live on while other films like it (TARZAN who?) disappear from memory. Mark my words. THE IRON GIANT is a MOVIE FOR ALL SEASONS, and ALL PEOPLE. Brad Bird, please take a bow."
1,Iron giant,"The movie itself was good and the boys enjoyed it but my problem is with amazon. The movie stopped a total of 8 times during viewing with no warning. Then needed to be restarted, fast forwarded, and reloaded. We got tired of doing this the first time we watched it so we tried again the second and the process repeated. This has happened to us the last 4 times we tried to view a movie from amazon and not sure if we will be trying again"
3,An OK movie at best,"This is an ok movie at best. I don't know why people are so gaga over it. I'm sure it'll keep your kids entertained in the car, but I was definitely bored watching this as an adult; I only watched it b/c the reviews were so high but it definitely did not live up to the hype."
5,Now THIS is a MOVIE!,"You will laugh, you will cry. You will cheer, you will be on the edge of your seat to see what will happen next. Forget that this movie is animated, it is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. But even though it is a cartoon, I would not recommend it for children under the age of 8, due to some of the more mature themes dealing with war and death. (Nothing too heavy, just not really appropriate for younger children.) But, when all is said and done, this is one of those rare movies that you can watch togehter with your 8 year old child, and your 80 year old grandmother, and everyone will thoroughly enjoy it. :)"
4,Nice show,"I saw this for the first time nearly 15 years ago, and I remembered liking it more then than I do now, but it is still a fun show with which I can relate well."
5,Awesome movie,All the reviews on Amazon were right. This movie is awesome! I some how missed this movie when it was released and noticed the excellent reviews it got when it became available on Amazon Prime. Wow! I highly recommend this one!
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"This film is one of the best! With a strong plot and great animation, this film presents great lessons, wonderful entertainment, and an overall good time. No complaints here. We loved it!"
5,good story,"I don't like the newer animations that runs in fastfoward speed and not-so-innocent silly jokes. This one is just like the honest movies they used to make, with a good story that touches your hearts. fun but not silly. My 6 year old loves it, I love it."
5,BETTER THAN ANY DISNEY ANIMATED FILM........,"THE BEST NON DISNEY ANIMATED FILM THE ENTIRE FAMILY COULD ENJOY.FINALLY, A MOVIE WITH NO CURSING,SEX,NUDITY,VIOLENCE,OR GORE.IT EARNS RAVE REVIEWS FROM CRITICS, WINS NUMEROUS AWARDS, and MAKES OVER 275 MILLION DOLLARS AROUND THE WORLD! A CROSS BETWEEN E.T. AND THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. GOOD SCRIPT, GREAT STORY, DECENT ACTING. IT OPENS HERE IN AMERICA FOR THEATER RELEASE AND....... it flops.just because DISNEY has nothing to do with this doesn't mean it's not a good children's film.americans have been screaming for years now for family films to play at theaters, yet when one comes along, it flops because DISNEY had nothing to do with it? go figure."
4,axp men's no show sock,"I wear a size 15 and these run a bit small. Otherwise, the socks are excellent quality. Great price."
3,not really what i thought it was,"I guess mom is right you should always read the fine print. When looking at the item you may believe yiu might actuallt get what is shown. Obviously i should have read the decription a little closer, because all i got was the dots and aparently that is what i ordered. but when i added the item to the cart it was because of the pic i saw."
4,A Bit of Nostaligia!,"This video is cute! You may not like it if you find issue with moms staying home in support of their husband and children, but even if you find issue with content, it moves along quickly, has great humor, and there's fun interchange between husband and wife. If you are a Doris Day fan, it is a good one to have."
3,The Thrill Of It All,"A disappointment for sure. With James Garner in it I thought Doris had a sure hit. Except for a few funny moments the picture was one I'm sure Doris and James would like to forget, I will."
5,loved it!,"This was purely entertaining. I don't like many of today's movies, but the oldies now that's entertainment.Garner and Day always paired well. I wish they would have done more together."
5,"""Thrilled by the whole movie""",The Thrill of it All is a must have for Doris Day fans. She is one of my favorite stars. and James Garner gives a great performance. You won't be disappointed .
5,Doris and James are amazing together I love this movie,I really love doris day and I own almost all of her movies. I love the chemistrybetween her and James Garner. It hard to find an actress who has such a goodconnection with more than one actor but doris day is truly a jewel. This is amovie that the whole family can watch together. You never know whats going tohappen next. I love the scene with the car in the pool filled with soap. Youcan't say enough good things about this movie. I could watch this movie all thetime. There will never be another actress as good as doris day. You can't go wrongbuying this movie. I will be starting my James Garner collection next. I can't waitadd his movies to my library.
5,Fun movie!,"This is a fun movie with Doris Day and James Garner at their best. It's a bit different from the Doris Day/Rock Hudson duo. Doris Day and James Garner are a happily married couple with 2 young children. The daughter is played by the same actress who was the youngest Von Trapp daughter in ""The Sound of Music."" They're so cute! This is a wonderful movie to watch on a lazy afternoon. Very enjoyable."
3,An Average Doris Day & James Garner Comedy,"""The Thrill of it All"" is o.k., but kind of meanders a bit due to a lack of focus in the script. I did enjoy the kids & the soap suds scene, however."
3,"Funny, but...um...a bit dated","So I laughed during ""The Thrill of It All,"" but it was often due to the incredibly dated portrayals of marriage and women. For a while it seemed that Doris Day was going to demonstrate that women can and should have careers if they so choose. Then, her husband decides to pretend he's having an affair to guilt her into returning to her 'wifely duties'. At the end, not only does he not admit to the fake affair, she completely falls for it and leaves her job! I realize that this film was made in the early 1960s and still appreciated the acting and humor, yet would find it difficult to show to my (non-existent) children without a thorough discussion of why it's perfectly fine for a woman to have a career. Also, what in the heck was Larry Gelbart doing writing stuff like this? I guess I associate him with shows with an edge, such as M*A*S*H, not light, traditional comedies such as this one."
2,Extreme disappointment,"As a huge fan of both Doris Day and James Garner, as well as numerous movies they have made individually, I was ready for a great comedy. After all, ""Send Me No Flowers"" and ""Pillow Talk"" are classics.How disappointing this movie was. Outside of a few laughs concerning the swimming pool, this was one boring scene after another.Of course, it's always great to see Edward Andrews and Burt Mustin (one of my all time favorites). But this one is best rented rather than bought....if you think you MUST see it."
3,"Dated, But Still Amusing At Times","This movie is too datedly sexist for me to say that I enjoy it on the whole, and if you haven't picked up either Day-Garner DVD, I'd recommend going with ""Move Over Darling"" first. However, it is good for an occasional laugh... Reginald Owen and the swimming pool sequence are amusing, as well as the predictability of the ""Happy Soap Playtime"" television program. The commercials shot by Doris Day's character are warm and funny, much like she is or was. I can guarantee that if Happy Soap were a real product, I'd be buying some today. I feel that the only real flaw apart from the sexism is that the supporting roles are poorly written and/or cast, which is unusual for a Doris Day film. I found Arlene Francis and Edward Andrews as an expectant couple to be unrealistic, for example.This is a film you'll certainly want to pick up while rounding out your Doris Day collection. It's just that there's a fair number of films that you should probably check out first."
4,"""Call your baby, my wife is having a husband!!!""","I watched this movie for the 1st time yesterday, and I thought it was pretty funny. I love the look of the classic 60's. Doris Day and James Garner star as Beverly and Gerald Boyer. Soon, Beverly is asked to star in a television commercial advertising Happy Soap. It takes a toll on Gerald who becomes jealous and doesn't have enough time to spend with his wife. I highly recommend THE THRILL OF IT ALL!!!"
5,Doris Day Fan,"I saw this movie at the drive-in when I was a small child. That probably dates me, but I absolutely love Doris Day movies. This is one of my all-time favorites. I could watch this movie over and over. Add it to your collection."
5,"If You Love '60s Doris Day, You'll Love This Comedy","This is classic Doris Day--a stay-at-home mother who suddenly becomes famous by doing soap commercials. It plays like a big-screen sitcom that has great production values, a fantastic supporting cast and, best of all, is a hilarious commentary on the TV business. Carl Reiner's satirical short scenes of ""TV shows"" are inserted throughout and helps offset the sweet home-life comedy that comes from Day's screen children. It's all just right and worth watching over and over."
1,Disappointed,"I was highly disappointed in this item. This is only a 2 page pamphlet that is an excerpt from her book. My advice, go to the library and borrow 'Conducting a Needs Assessment' by the same author."
3,"Very basic, but still a good program!","Being an American who has recently moved to Holland, I have searched & searched for the best self-study Dutch language course. I have yet to find it, even here in Holland. I purchased the Dutch in Three Months before I left America and so far, it seems to be the best program. It gives a good vocabulary base (although some words just are not used here, & they can be a bit outdated), it gives a very basic knowledge of the very difficult grammer, and exercises with some translation that are very helpful. Overall, this program is good, except that it could have been more in-depth. It could have offered more Grammer exercises along with the translations. If you are wanting a basic knowledge of Dutch, this is a good 'getting started' program to have. Although it is a MUST to have the audio tapes that go with it. Dutch pronounciation is very different than English."
3,So so,"It is more grammatical. It can help as a reference and it is simple, but if you want to learn the language to live in a country who's language is Nederlands (Dutch), then don't buy this as your priority book... only as a simple reference book it is ok."
1,BAD BUY!,This book has even spelling mistakes and translating mistakes in it! Bad idea and insulting to the Dutch people as it doesn't particularly make us look good to foreigners.... just a small preview:first lesson: page 32 converation (chapter 3)1)Do you see those two women there!2)do you mean the one with the dress and the long hair?1)That hair is much too beautiful. It's a wig...My boyfriend after 3 chapters learnt only how to tell my mum that she has a wig on her head! Get it?!?
4,Did the job,"We decided to learn more about opera in general, so we bought a bunch of CDs in our attempt to educate ourselves in more depth. This CD helped in that goal. What more can we ask?"
4,Decent sock but not quite stretchy enough through ankle area,"Nice sock, but the leg area was not really ample or stretchy enough, in my opinion, to be considered plus size. I will probably pass these on to my sons, who wear 8 men's size."
3,"Costco has good price, but...","... it was on sale. But the quality turn out to be not so good. When you put in ""plain paper,"" it will get stuck very frequently. I guess it only like papers that are designed for ""ink jet printer"" only...Also, the cartridge is very expensive ...so you might want to think twice before you buy this one..."
3,Very Heavy/Hard to Adjust Sound,"I have had several acoustic amps in my time. I traded in my Crate for the AC-150. First of all, it is very heavy and difficult to carry from your car to the gig. Secondly, I have had varying results with the adjustments to make it sound crisp and clear. Lots of power for ramping up the sound. I don't know if I would purchase it again due to weight."
3,You have to take multiple pills each day,"Read the fine print - you need to take 4 pills per day which makes these pills a little pricey. Other than that, they seemed to work fine. It was nice to get DHA and the other prenatal vitamins in one pill."
2,fishy,"While they are very complete there are too many negatives to make them worth to me. First you need to take them twice a day now while this may not be a problem for some people this proved to be too much of a hassle for me I'd always forget my morning dose. Second, they are VERY fishy! Even hours after I'd take them I could still taste the fish oil. With my already queasy stomach I just couldn't bear to do it anymore. I am now taking prescription Natelle Plus with DHA and much prefer those."
1,They smell/taste horrible!,"I think it's the alfalfae in it that makes them smell/taste so bad, and i get this nasty aftertaste i burp up all day long with them. I only take one a day. (It says on the bottle to take more than that a day.. eww) The pills are pretty big too.Won't be buying again."
3,"Graham Greene, England Made Me","Not one of Greene's classics, but worth reading for the atmosphere of exiled Englisness that the author creates, specifically in the character of Minty."
2,Difficult going,"I have read a lot of GG and consider myself an admirer, but this one was a real chore to get through. It honestly gave me a headache several times. The sister and brother Farrant are fairly compelling characters but the Swedish industrialist Krogh is a complete cipher-- also murky beyond comprehension are whatever financial shenanigans he is up to. The book has moments of clarity but large swatches (page after page really) were for me nearly incomprehensible. The story appears to be narrated from several points of view which adds to the confusion. Stick with his better known works unless you are determined to read everything he ever wrote."
5,The Right Stuff,"This is a GREAT film and shows ALL that view it, just what Americans are made of and part of what WE Stand for.!!! Also, the film is just what I wanted. Thanks"
5,I want to be a rocket man,If you are fascinated about the space program... this is a must see DVD. Ed Harris makes a better John Glenn than the real John Glenn and he is a living American hero.
4,Piece of History.,This is a very good example of the first space missions and the problems that had to be solved. Very important piece of history.
5,Truly inspiring! An absolute classic.,"This film just has no flaws. The acting is great. Particulary Ed Harris and Fred Ward as John Glenn and Gus Grissom respectively. But as always Dennis Quaid is fabulous and histerical at the same time.What makes this film so special is the direction and the combination of multiple courageous, tragic, uplifting, ironic and heroic stories all woven together so perfectly. The scene that comes to mind the most for me is the way that Mr. Kaufman weaves the final reception with LBJ for the astronauts with Chuck Yeagers last solo flight of the film. Absolutely beautiful.Plus there's plenty of comedy particularly while there undergoing the selection process."
3,"Good HD video, not so good sound.","While the HD video is good to watch, I'm somewhat disappointed that it lacks a 5.1 soundtrack so what should be some awesome flying sequences with surround sound, just aren't there. I would consider purchasing one of the DVD versions of this film instead to get the better audio."
5,Great DVD!,"Even though this movie was made in the 1980's... it is a great one to show to my high school Honors Astronomy class. It is long but does a great job documenting the test pilot program and the beginning of the NASA space program! Great price, shipped quickly and I received it on time, and great overall quality and character development! Highly recommend!"
5,An epic expeience of space and flight brilliantly filmed.,This movie covers early developments of the US space industry spanning from the late 1940's through to the 1950's and 1960's. It is without doubt the most definitive expose on the young test-pilot's who flew the first manned aircraft to break the sound barrier. It moves on to cover some of the most dramatic and exciting events of the first years of the space age. Brilliantly acted by an all-star cast. Five stars. Well worth adding to your home collection for the fact of just pure history alone. Highly recommended for those interested in real space exploration and aviation history.
4,Would get 5 stars if it were on blu-ray!!!,"Spectacular film about aviation and the beginning of space flight. I absolutely love it. I have been waiting for a looong time for this to come out on blu-ray, and I couldn't wait any longer. The picture is good and the audio is decent. The film itself deserves 5 stars."
1,so so wrong,"Well, they got the names of the astronauts right, and it was project Mercury. But other than that NOTHING about this movie is even close to the truth. In particular, the character assassination of Gus Grissom, an excellent astronaut who not only flew on the second Mercury flight but also on the First Gemini flight and who was slated for an early Apollo flight is just shameful. Especially considering Gus gave his life in the Apollo I fire. I understand it's not a documentary but when you're portraying real people and real events I think you have some responsibility to the truth."
2,READ THE BOOK,"Not too many who saw this film seem to have read the book. I did and I know the movie completely misses many subtleties and points of Tom Wolfe's ""new journalism"" work. There was no depiction of the astronauts' psyche - first the humiliation of great fighter pilots chosen to duplicate what a monkey accomplished; then feelings of a military man's anxiety of ""fouling up"" a simple task, flying in a rocket. These are examples of finer details important to the story, yet the director failed to grasp."
2,Surprisingly bad,"The Bottom Line:This agonizingly long film which devotes at least an hour of screen time to Sam Shepherd riding his horse, talking to his wife in the sunset, and doing brave deeds merely out of manly duty might better be titled ""Chuck Yeager: All-American Hero;"" unhappy to merely humanize and reconstruct the heroes of the Space Age, the film decides to invent one and in so doing becomes an overlong mismatch of ideas and scenes that drags mightily and presents 5 dumb moments (e.g. the Aborigines' sparks keep John Glenn aloft! LBJ as a big comical buffoon!) for every good one.2/4"
3,Decent Movie At Best,"The Right Stuff is a decent movie at most. Much of the film seems to be just thrown in for no apparent reason. Also, the life of Yeager does not add much to the story. The film can be highly comic at times, while at others it is deathly serious. The picture and sound quality of this DVD are superb, especially for an older movie."
2,Superficial Propaganda,"Space development is one of my favorite themes. And I knew this movie had high reputations. So I expected much when I bought a copy.But I was really disappointed.Are Americans the only people who have ""the right stuff""? Ofcourse NOT. Russians would have had the same human dramas in space development. And people in other countries have. Why can't hollywood show any respect to other countries? It's really disgusting.Anyway, this film is a product of the Cold War."
5,The Right Stuff (Two-Disc Special Edition),"In 1947, a group of determined men gathered at a remote Air Force base in the high desert of California. Their goal was to break the sound barrier by using a small rocket-powered test plane called the X-1. The only problem was that others had tried before, and not all had survived. Some thought of the sound barrier as a ""demon that lived in the sky"", waiting to destroy any who dared confront it. This movien covers the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager to the Mercury 7 astronauts, showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select people to be in it. Thrilling, funny, charming and electrifying all at once."
5,The Right Stuff is Real,"Through great casting and near-perfect screenwriting, this movie presents the transformation of the U.S. following WWII to a space exploring nation. The movie is based on a stellar book by Tom Wolfe, and the depictions of his pilots-cum-astronauts as they struggle to retain their pilot identities within the confines of training for these first probes into space ring true. Poignantly, their experiences are contrasted with those of perhaps the greatest test pilot of that generation, Chuck Yeager, who never became an astronaut."
5,AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY,"THE RIGHT STUFF IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY! I repeat, it is NOT a documentary! Nor was it meant to be. So all of you NASA addicts just relax and enjoy. All cultures have a mythology - why can't we? Many of the surviving plays of the Greeks or Shakespeare's history plays use historical characters merely as a departure point to dramatize the human condition. The Right Stuff is a beautifully crafted piece of ""American Mythology."" There is Glory: John Glenn. There is humanity: Gordon Cooper. There is Honor without the reward of Glory: Chuck Yeager. And there is tragedy: Gus Grissom. And all of these layers are woven together beautifully - point and counterpoint by Tom Wolfe & Phillip Kaufman."
5,A special time in US history,"For those who did or did not live during this period of time, a must see. The United States was at war in Vietnam and we still sent men into space and to the moon."
5,Worth watching more than once,"Although there are parts of it that make for a good story, many parts portray accurately what happened, and the heroism and dedication of our astronauts and the entire force behind their unbelievable successes."
3,"Not bad, but not always historically accurate","This movie featured some superb special effects and some great acting performances, but it needed more attention to detail. They made Lyndon Johnson look like a clown with their cartoonish portrayel of him, and was harsh on Annie Glenn with her speech problem. I also would have liked more coverage of the spaceflights, and less attention to Chuck Yeager's and the astronaut's antics. In fact, the only time Wally Schirra and Deke Slayton appear are in a few scenes with all seven of the Mercury astronauts. Some of the real astronauts, similiarly, are a bit critical of this movie. Having said that, however, The Right Stuff was a good overall narrative of the Mercury program and the epic space race against the Soviet Union. If you are a space buff, it is still probably worth your time."
5,A fable of the early days of the space program,"""The Right Stuff' is an epic movie that makes one feel like standing up and cheering at the end. It is brilliantly photographed and performed, and the script is easily the best of its type ever written. It is not only a great story about momentous events, but also a moving (and often very funny) look at the real people behind great events. I've known many test pilots and military fliers, and no movie has ever captured their often off-the-wall antics the way that this one does. Everyone involved in the making of this classic movie should have received an award of some kind - its lack of success at the box office is baffling. It is one of the few movies that I've owned in three formats (VHS, LD, and DVD), and the DVD version is easily the best yet - with the exception of the necessity to set subtitle and language selections every time one watches it.""The Right Stuff"" is history not as it was, but as it should have been."
2,Poor Packaging,"I've had this movie on VHS for years and decided I would like to have a DVD version. The movie is outstanding and will always be a classic. However, this DVD lacks in quality of packaging. They have recorded both sides of one DVD rather than making it a 2-DVD version. The case is the cheapest kind you can find. I saw this package in the Walmart 2/$10 bin one time and didn't buy it because it was so cheaply packaged. I would recommend the 2-DVD version sold by Amazon, even if it is more expensive."
5,An inspiring film,"As one of those children of baby boomers who was raised on stories of the Mercury 7 and the Apollo program, this movie in a nutshell shows what the space program was (and still should be) all about. Unlike the sanitized lives we know so well from ""Life"" magazine and countless interviews, this film makes those astronauts into real, flawed, 'heroic' people. For those who enjoyed Apollo 13, this is a definite must-see and an obvious inspiration for that movie, although it is less tightly-focused, since it focuses on much more than just one flight. The DVD copy has fine video and even better sound -- well worth the investment. And Yeager's cameo is one of the most thrilling I've seen, not because of his performance, but because of what he means to this country and civilization."
5,A great movie.,"I saw this movie when it came out and read the book also. The book is a great story of the triumph of American engineering and courage in the story of Chuck Yeager, the Bell X-1, the Mercury 7 and NASA. However some of the reviewers are wrong about Chuck Yeager. He never wanted to be a part of NASA of the astronaut program. He was a test pilot through and through and he felt there would be no flying in the Mercury program. As the movie and the book shows the Mercury 7 had to fight to get flight controls in their capsules because they were just going to be passengers instead of actually controlling the craft if something happened.This movie and the book are the ideal companions to have for someone who is interested in the early days of NASA and the coolness and skill of the greatest pilot of all time, Brig. Gen Chuck Yeager."
5,Great DVD,This is a very good DVD that covers the early space test and exploration. If you like space stuff you will truly enjoy it very much.Would recommend to my friends.
5,The Right Stuff-The Right Choice,"The Right Stuff combines the factual account of the beginning of the space race with wit and humour.Never ceasing to amaze me throughout its 2hour plus duration with fine acting,sharp oneliners,fast moving and interesting storyline and excellent special effects.The film lies in that murky area between movie and documentary.All the characters are believable, the script sharp and most of all the story is interesting.It puts Apollo 13 and other films of the same genre to shame.Recommended for all the family, but especially for those with a burning nostalgia for the paranoid world of the cold war.Thankfully this films spares us from a jingoistic undercurrent."
5,Let's light this candle!,"Remember when we had big dreams? When a president said we will ""land a man on the moon and bring him back safely""? This movie does. I love the dialogue, the characterizations and the yearning-for-the-sky score by Bill Conti, but most of all I love the depiction of a period when our nation believed there was no goal too high, too far to be achieved. ... Note to those disappointed by the DVD's two-sided, flip-the-disc format: the theatrical release of The Right Stuff contained an intermission, so the DVD pause is ""true"" to the film, so to speak."
4,Artistic History,"I read The Right Stuff, and I saw the movie when it came out. After seeing it again on DVD, I had a new appreciation of the men who broke such new ground, or sky I should say, with their flights. The movie is an artistic, heroic representation of historic events. Men like Chuck Yeager and Charles Lindbergh pushed the edge of the envelope for those who would become astronauts and for much technology that drives our times in 2009."
3,Corny and a bit dated,"This preceded by at least a decade Hollywood's obsession with relatively accurate biopics, so what you see here is very old-school: corny humor, stereotypes and emotional manipulation at every turn. The women are all long-suffering, the politicians clueless, the nerds who recruit the astronauts feckless and the astronauts themselves macho. Most macho is Chuck Yeager, of course, the high school grad who wasn't educated enough to be an astronaut, but who is portrayed as probably the bravest and best qualified. This also suffers from long periods of relatively boring exposition, such as the attempted comic health testing of the would-be astronauts. The movie is over 3 hours, which is about 90 minutes too long. This wasn't a big hit, and it seems dated by today's standards. It was up against ""The Big Chill"" back then, with that film's then-innovative soundtrack of oldies. This cast, however, is largely perfect in their resemblance to their real-life counterparts."
2,"Great movie, lousy DVD","I've tried watching this DVD on my Toshiba notebook using both InterActual's PCFriendly and Mediamatics DVDExpress. In both cases, the movie always plays right away; I never get the start menu like it shows on the back of the box. Also whenever I fast forward or rewind, the movie freezes and won't play, so I get to shut down the player or sometimes even ""End Task"" on the player. As another review already noted, the movie is burned into both sides of the disk. If the menu, fast forward and rewind worked I'd be happy, because this is a great movie, but unfortunately I can't recommend this DVD. Maybe you'll have more success with other players."
3,OK Sling,"I guess my baby never took to a sling but this sling didn't seem very secure to me. I mostly use this as a cover up now since the price is similar to other cover ups out there.The problem is that the pouch part of the sling doesn't correspond really to baby's butt so the baby is kind of hanging out in a hammock. The baby was also carrying low. I tried to tighten the sling but it was just a lot of material to force through the buckle as you tried to shorten the strap. When you take a look at the picture for the product, the widest part of the sling will wind up being on your shoulder. At least that is what happened to me.The instructions included with the sling are also not helpful. They only show a picture of the baby can be carried and that is it.If you know how to work slings, this seems like a good sling as it is well constructed and the fabric is nice. The design is also pretty. The padded shoulder part is also another plus. Otherwise those who are sling inept like me, stay away!"
3,Baby Sling,"As far as baby slings go, I really have only had this one, so I cannot compare it to any others. I will say that it runs pretty large, so mine did not fit like the lady in the picture it hung much lower. It was stylish but if you are of a smaller frame it may not work for you. I am somewhere in the middle, thin and tall. It did not adjust enough to keep the baby up very high. I only used it when my baby was quite small for shopping trips. At home it was a little difficult because you have to keep one hand on the baby at all times to make sure they are safe..."
5,Lite On is great!,"Lite On responded quickly and sent my sling quickly. It is a sturdy well sewn sling. The color/print looks even better in person. I need to reread instructions as my baby grows to fully use the sling, but it is a good product."
4,Wish I had this sling when my baby was a newborn,"Our son seemed to be the kind of baby who would have been feeling snuggly and secure if we had this when he was a newborn. It seemed as though, because he was not used to being carried in it from the first few weeks, he seemed to be a little bit Claustrophobic in it. By the time we got it he had grown so much bigger and my wife was not able to nurse him in it the way it is suggested for newborns. We will definately be keeping it for our next child, though."
2,dont like it,i like the idea of the sling but the design of ring and its weaknesses and fabric material makes it very difficult to adjust once the baby is inside due to the gravity of the baby. also due to that i'm not sure if the baby is in proper position or not or it could affect the bone of my baby. dont recommend this unless the fabric is softer and ring is stronger to easily adjust
5,love this sling!,"I bought this sling quite a while ago for use with my then younger baby. I still use it with my 14-month old. I love it. It's great for quick trips or traveling. The only thing I wouldn't recommend it for is for extended use. That's just a personal preference though. I like my baby's weight to be spread more evenly over both shoulders (by using a wrap) if I'm going to be carrying her for more than an hour. However, if you like ring slings, or are looking for a good quality and super cute ring sling for your first one, this is a good choice. I've washed mine many times and there's not so much as a string coming loose anywhere I can see. The fabric hasn't even faded."
3,Disappointing.,"I found this sling very disappointing. The fabric does not pull through the rings easily, and I thought the directions on how to wear your baby in this sling conflicting with general safe babywearing guidelines. My son hates being worn in this, but that could just be a matter of his personal preference. Still, I find this sling frustrating to use."
3,It's Okay,"I didn't find it comfortable compared to the Ergo or more expensive carriers; however, I was able to use it at the mall once. I think that these are better for newborns. My child was about 11-12lbs when I used it and I found her a bit too big for it."
3,eh,Its nice and continent but i felt like i never used it right and it was awkward sometimes. I wish i had the other type of sling even though it takes more time to put on
2,Hard to use with younger baby,"I thought for the price this one would be good, but it comes with poorly written instructions and it took two of us to get my son in it- once in it was not very supportive. I'm putting it aside until he is a litte older to see if maybe it will work better for us then."
1,Not useful at all!,"I bought this one in pink-lavender stripes and found that it's impossible to use it correctly and very uncomfortable for the child in it (the whole body and especially the neck). I prefer the ""real"" carriers though. I would not recommend this type of carrier to anyone."
2,Not suitable for newborns,"Our DD hated this product. It nearly suffocated her, and caused what we think is painful bending in the neck and spine. She still hates it at 4 months, but loves the Baby Bjorn.I think it will be more useful when she is 6-9 months old, but I see no reason to kill your back with this when the Bjorn works so well."
1,Nice Idea But...,"I bought this sling for my newborn and I LOVED the idea of a sling so I could have my hands free while holding him close. It is VERY difficult to use this sling without feeling like baby's head is either ""chin-crunched"" or flopping all around. Maybe I'm over cautious but only once did I feel comfortable with him in it. I did return this sling only because of useage issues. The fabric, instruction manual, pattern and rings all seemed just fine. It was a little more pink in color than I thought it would be. If you're looking for an alternative I spent the extra money on the Moby wrap and I am THRILLED with it. It's not difficult to use once you get a routine down and baby seems a lot more secure and I'm a lot more comfortable."
3,Okay Sling,"I have to admit I'm not much of a baby-wearer to start. My son doesn't like to be confined. But, that being said, this sling has been a life-saver a handful of times. Once when he wouldn't nap in his stroller at a friend's BBQ I put him in the sling and he passed right out. And it's also comes in handy for the grocery store when I don't want to mess with the baby bjorn. I'm giving it three stars, however, because I don't think this thing would hold up with daily use. It seems a bit ""homemade"" for that and I don't trust it to hold my son's weight entirely - I am always partially holding him, carrying some of his weight."
5,very nice,"This works very well, I love the padding on the shoulder- the 'Dusk' pattern/color is incredibly beautiful, very true to the picture. I looked at many other slings, both more expensive and less, and I'm happy I chose this one. I used a Moby with my first baby and liked it also, but this one allows me to breastfeed (even walking around in public, with no one the wiser!). I've used it for two months and washed it several times, it looks new but better, because the material is softer now.I also have an Ergo, which I adore and have used with my older baby for two years and continue to love. This sling is perfect for the little one until he is old enough for the Ergo."
5,this is a MUST! :),"my Baby girl LOVES this,she falls right to sleep everytime!...i use this around the house,and mostly when i go out...much better than going into stores with a big carseat,i just slide her in before we get out of car..so much easier!..& i have gotten so many compliments on it! :)"
1,Don't like it,I bought this product for my newborn and unless you have a gargantuan baby this sling will sag to or below your waist. I adjusted it as tight as I could and I just went to walgreens and bought a sling by infantino...it was a waste of my money
1,uncomfortable and baby hates it,"I wish I never bought this product. It is really really uncomfortable to adjust and always has extra fabric hanging in the area where the baby should be sitting, so it never supports her correctly. No wonder my baby hates it."
3,Small rings creates too much friction,"At 2.5 inches outer diameter these rings are smallish, creating too much friction to make it versatile enough to use with ease. The thickness of the fabric is like a sheets from bedding, but enough stitching makes up for that structurally.Don't know if this is true of all slings, but puts much pressure on one shoulder that transfers to the back, causing pain on both parts."
3,ok sling,"This sling is nice, but not my cup of tea. I wanted something that would free my hands, but with this sling I felt that I always needed to support and hold my baby. I was concerned that he might fall out of it. Baby did like the sling, but we both like the baby bjorn better. No fear of him falling out of it-truly hands free!"
2,"Pretty, but one size does not fit all","I was still pregnant when I ordered this and a newbie babywearer at best. I wanted a ring sling and liked the padded shoulder and the low price of this item. Unfortunately the padded rails rendered it useless for me, as I couldn't snug it up tight enough to use before the padding would hit the ring. I'm 5' 5"" and have an average build, so it's not like I'm super petite or anything. It was even too big for my husband who's 6' with an athletic build. I may yet try cutting it apart to get some use out of it (I'd already washed it before the baby arrived, and didn't realize until I'd tried using it with him that it wouldn't work), but ended up buying a different sling from Sleeping Baby that I absolutely love -- even if it was more than twice as expensive.I will say the Charcoal Parsemage was quite nice looking though!"
5,"Kate Serdy's ""The Singing Tree""","I bought this as a Christmas present for a young cousin, because it was one of my favorite books when I was young. It takes place in Hungary during World War I. It's a sequel to ""The Good Master"" , and both books deal with a way of life that died with World War II, if not before. With both their fathers at war, Kate and Jancsi must help run the great farm, which appears to have been roughly equivalent to a large ranch or estancia."
4,The Singing Tree,"This book and the other one by the same Author arrived in excellent condition. I loved tham both. I first read them when I was 10 years old, even the illustrations are the same. I wanted to read them to my grandchildren.Thank you"
1,More like Jazz,The sound quality of my cd here was really bad. It seem to me that this package was quickly thrown together. It taught me very little.
2,I couldn't get motivated,"A good piano teacher knows that a student needs continuing motivation and fullfillment in order for the student to progress. This is a challenging job for a music teacher, while working only through a book and an accompanying CD. Cohen's volumes 1 and 2 show only keyboard exercises with absolutely no written guidance for the student. For a more fullfilling learning experience with blues piano, see my review of Alan Swain's ""Improvise, a Step-by-Step Approach."""
5,a very accessible instructional,"This instructional doesn't waste any time. I was amazed at how soon I began to improvise, and would often times find myself having already improvised the next lesson."
4,Real Stories About Real Twins,"As a twin, I really hate some of the questions that singletons ask, but Susan Kohl seemed to really understand some of the issues that twins face, like being separated for the first time in school and then as an adult trying to separate to find your own identity. She didn't tell the story, the twins told it."
1,A great disappointment,"Married to an identical twin I have always been fascinated by their unique bond and thought this book would be interesting. Unfortunately, this book sheds absolutely no light on anything about twins and is very frustrating and very boring to read. Kohl jumps around continuously with no more than one paragraph devoted to discussion of each incident she reports. Her work is shallow and has absolutely no scientific basis or research behind it -- neither hers nor anyone elses whom she might have chosen to reference but does not. Her explanations have no more depth than a conversation with a stranger on a bus. She is at best a reporter of snipets of conversation that she gathered at a twins convention. This book was not worth the money and would only be useful to someone who has never encountered, known or even heard about twins. I was greatly disappointed."
2,"For the twin curious, this may be an amusing book . . .","but for anyone close to a twin (or even a twin) this book is very vague. The book glazes over the topics in a twins life that truly make them unique and repeats the same things throughout. There are many other aspects of the twin bond that are not even approached by this author. Though I must admit, I was very impressed by the fact that the mother of 6 year old twins was brave enough to venture into the area of the twinless twins, a subject that many twins dare not think about out of fear of being the remaining twin. Approaching this topic and allowing the reader the opportunity to broach a subject that will be life altering for half of the worlds twins in itself is a good reason to read this book. Probably the only good reason. Overall, the book was a difficult read because of the repetition and topic hopping back and forth."
3,Beauty over function?,"This is a beautiful addition to my garden and the feeder is well constructed and doesn't look cheap. The problem that I have had is that I have been unable to find a food that will actually come out of the feeder. My usual mixed bird food just clogs up the small areas for the food to come out. I have tried just millet and just sunflower seeds, but the birds only use this feeder if my other four are empty!"
3,....of early Bach Family (not by JS himself),"The contents of this CD are as follows:(1) Siehe, wie fein und lieblich by Georg Christoph Bach (1642-97)(2) Meine Freundin, du bist Scho:n by Johann Christoph Bach (1642-1703)(3,4) Ach, bleib bei uns Herr Jesu Christ and Ach, wie sehnlich wart ich der Zeit, both by JM Bach (1648-94)Recorded by Hans Gruss and Capella Fidicinia (c.1980?) but not a patch I'm afraid on the legendary 2CD set of Bach ancestors recorded by Goebel and Musica Antiqua Koln which duplicates all the pieces here. That set remains definitive, if you can find it."
4,Easy read by Bentley...,I like how Bentley does not give you all of the answers and leaves alot to the imagination so you can let your mind wander into unknown territory.Why were people disappearing? What is this unspoken evil?Fast paced although a little disappointing ending.Still a must for fans.
2,Not what I thought.,I liked the start of the book and some parts in the middle but the characters I didn't like and there were too many of them. Glen and the others just weren't drawn up enough to be believable people. I also couldn't stand the nonstop references to the Aztec towns and stuff. Everytime a good part would happen and there was exitment the author would end the chapter and start another one. The ending was terrible too. In spite of all that it wasn't a totally bad read and I never had to force myself to keep reading.
1,"Scary Premise, Horrible Book","The idea behind this book is really creepy, but that's where it ends. The characters are totally undeveloped and cliche. By the end, I really didn't care whether they lived or died. The climax of the book is totally unbelievable, and not in a good way - it seemed like Little just got them into so much trouble and just couldn't come up with a credible way to get them out of it.I love Little's short stories, but this was the first novel of his that I've read and it totally put me off."
1,where suspension of disbelief is unbelievable...,"This is the first novel I have read by Bentley Little, and it was a disaster. First, the author must have had a morphine drip in his arm while constructing such a long list of uni-dimensional characters who find themselves caught in a struggle with a ""monster"" unleashed after they unearthed some Native American artifacts. There are dancing pottery shards featuring technicolor images of characters that view them, and, of course, there's that green-haired ""Mongollon Monster"" who is just thrown into the mix like cayenne pepper into a ham and cheese omelet. PLEASE!!!!!!! If you like monsters prowling around old ruins, then try Owl Goingback's ""Crota."""
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR A LITTLE FAN,"Having read every Bentley Little book, including Death Instinct, I can honestly and regretfully say that this is his worst book. After the first hundred or so pages, I could tell that Bentley had lost his inspiration .... Ridiculous scenes involving dancing pottery killed any horror or suspense that could have built from this complete mess of a story that dragged on and on. I love this author, don't get me wrong, but this is one to skip. I recommend The Ignored, The Mailman, and The Association."
3,Don't make this your first Little book.,"I picked this novel for my first read by Bentley Little, an author highly recommended to me as a fan of Stephen King. However, there were way too many characters to keep track of, some of which were not even introduced until halfway through the book! Every time he changed point of view, I had to struggle to remember who this person was. The ending was also highly anticlimatic after making the evil in this book seem like the possible bringer of Armageddon. I give it 3 stars only because for some reason I did not give up on it, and that is saying something, though I'm not sure what! I will not be picking up another Bentley Little book, there are too many other authors out there to choose from!"
2,Quite a letdown,"I have read all of Bentley Little's books except for ""The Association"" and ""The Policy,"" which probably explains why I stuck with this book until the end. I seriously considered stopping around page 150 because the book was just a random series of events happening to characters that I really didn't care about. ""But,"" I thought, ""Little's done it before,"" so I kept going, hoping that either a plot would show up or that things would be explained.Well, no plot ever showed up, and things were sort of explained, but it came late and you REALLY had to suspend disbelief to accept it. And at the end, I still didn't care about any of the characters, but by the time I was really set to give up, I only had about 75 pages to go, so I just finished it.If you haven't read Little, read ""The Store"" instead of this."
3,Yawn........zzzzzzz.....zzzz....ewww.,"This book was soooo boring. It took me a week to finish this book and I usually read a book in 1 or 2 days. It seemed to be a long nasty movie of the week with gross paragraphs randomly tossed in in the attempt to make it more interesting. It built to a very unsatisfying conclusion that was totally ridiculous in how the ""monsters"" were vanquished. It also never told what they were or why these things happend to my satisfaction. Just don't waste your time. This the first and last book I will read by this author."
1,Do Not Return,"This book is stupid. We all know that when it comes to horror and scifi one must have a suspension of disbelief but this is one ridiculous book!-A ""monster"" of the ""boogie man"" class.-Dancing pottery.-Artifacts that attack people.-Blood and gore, sadism and perversity more comical than shocking.-Main characters for which you develop not the slightest interest or liking because they are narcissistic and juvenile."
3,ok but not good,"the book had a nice plot and story line. ive always enjoyed books with history entangled in it. but this book was all over the place, you had to keep reading just to find out what character was talking, which can get very annoying. i <u>Hated</u> the ending it was terriable it was just so dissapointing no though at all. its a ok book if your bored and have nothing else to read, love the author but this book was a stinker."
2,Not a book I'd return to,"No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't absorb myself in this book like I have been able with most of the other books Little has written. By desciption alone, the plot isn't bad, but it's not terribly interesting to read about. There was just no magic here. I read the events, didnt care about them, didnt care about the characters, and didnt really care about the outcome. This was one of those novels I read for awhile, and kept coming back to after reading another book to finish. I was just bored...I can't put my finger on why exactly, but it's a truth. The pace would speed up, then slow down again, repeating it's vicious cycle.My advice? If you're wanting to sample Little, try one of his other books instead, like the House of the Revelation."
2,Not Impressed,"This was the first book I've read by Bentley Little. I purchased it because it sounded interesting. I had to force myself to actually finish it...sorry. This book did not make me want to rush out and purchase another of his works. The story was just ridiculous to me and at times I was disgusted by things put in this book. This is just my opinion however, others may enjoy it."
1,Worst book EVER!,"I picked up this book for five bucks from a half-price bookstore and I'm upset I even spent that much. There is no resolution to this completely ridiculous, convoluted, mess of a story. The author has plot twists that lead to absolutely nowhere, and seems to forget about characters only to write them in later as an after thought with some ridiculous story once he remembers . The author bases the storyline around some mysterious monsters for which he offers no description or explanation other than being dark with an orange afro, while in contrast spending an inordinate amount of time describing every pit stop the main characters take on their journey, no matter how little relevance it bore to the central storyline. The author then culminated the book with a lackluster ""climax"" and resolution that left me wishing Id never read the book at all. Terrible book"
2,Mildly Interesting But Then It Belly Flops,I'm sorry but this story is not one worth finishing. It fails on every level.Characters. Plot. Monsters. All cliche and boring.I found myself reading the first sentences of each paragraph only to keep the story moving. I don't think I missed anything worth reading.
1,'Boo..' are you scared now? yes? then read this book!,"This starts as a great book but fall flat after couple of pages. There are too many loose threads and very confusing book. Now a days writing confusing horror book is a fashion or what? I will tell you, if you HAVE to read this book, keep store receipt handy to return this book. Most of the matirial in this book is laughable! LOL. If someone says 'boo' to you in day light, in front of 1000 people,telling you that he is going to tell you 'boo' and if you get scared after that,then you will love this book."
1,Farfetched and Just Terrible!,"Once you figure out what the plot is and that none of the bizarre going-ons is going to lead up to anything interesting, this is a book that almost turns you off the author. It's definitely this author's worste book. AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I WASTED MY TIME ON IT.What a shame. The premise is interesting. Bizarre killings, archeological artificats that seem to be possessed, a society that just disappeared. BUT OK ALIENS FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION! AND THEY AREN'T EVEN EXPLAINED!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! BUY DOMINION!"
2,Very disappointed - was expecting a lot more,"I was really expecting to be completely scared. Mr. Little has a great reputation for writing great horror stories, but this was not a great horror story. Way too many characters I could care less about, way too many random events taking place that I could care less about, and a ""monster"" that wouldn't scare my daughter if she saw it. There were so many bizarre, unexplained occurences that I kept expecting to be resolved and never did. And the ending!?!?!?!?!?!? What is up with that? It was as if Mr. Little ran out of ideas and just gave up. The best part of reading this novel is that I learned what not to do when writing my own tale of hororr/supernatural. Thanks!"
2,Great Start But Credibility Dimnishes Quickly,"I bought this book on impulse. I like a good horror novel and have grown tired of everyone's teeth falling out as they do in most Stephen King novels. What's up with that anyway?The Return starts out well with a mid30's man who leaves his job in search of something ""new."" He finds it in Arizona. Strange things are happening with Indian relics that are being uncovered all over Arizona. This was pretty good until people started disappearing in a ""vortex"" and relics start ""walking.""...I am still finishing this book and hope it improves. The best I can give this book is a 2. Maybe it will improve. I just bought The University because I am willing to give Bentley another chance."
2,Not a very well written book,"I find it hard to believe that anyone could honestly give this book a rating of five. It's pretty bad. The book drags, doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and the ending is definitely a letdown. I wouldn't have guessed it was written by a professional. It almost seems a good template for how not to write a novel.There are some interesting scenes and details, the book isn't completely without merit, but overall the story is just a wet, sticky mess. Fewer ideas better executed would have made for a better read. There are so many little scenes and ideas and characters in this book and it never really comes together into anything cohesive."
1,Proof the back cover shouldn't guide purchasing decisions,"I read the blurb on the back cover, and thought this book sounded interesting. How wrong I was. The overall plot was pretty confusing, and there were some things that were more ridiculous than scary. I know it is a horror fantasy, but the book doesn't even stay true to it's internal logic. It reads like a first draft rather than a final product. I can't understand the people who are giving this thing 4 and five stars. Heed this warning and skip this book."
3,I.C TITLE DVD,"This could be such a great dvd but do to vinces hatred of the macho man i doubt it will be, i doubt vince will put anything to do with the macho man on this dvd."
4,good mailing great dvd,was good got it in the mail in like four days and the movie is fantastic just a great movies
4,"If you didn't like ""The history of the WWE championship"" then don't buy this","The History of the WWE Intercontinental championship, is a good compilation of WWE IC matches. I wish it had a documentary about the title but it didn't. If you don't like the ""History of the WWE championship"" then you probably wont like this. Out of all the titles they should do a compilation of, it should be the ""Hardcore title"". I gave it 4 stars because there was no documentary."
5,good choice,"After much searching I decided on this dress for my birthday princess. I opted for the larger size (M) and while it is a little too long for our tall 4 yr old, within a few months, it will be just fine. The body of the dress is soft and stretchy. My daughter loves the fact she can change into this without fasteners. No itchies or scratchies!It is sparkly, and ultra-pretty.I did not purchase any extra netting or underskirts. This dress is plenty 'full' enough and does not need anything extra. She was thrilled. Have not washed it yet, but the workmanship looks good and I have high expectations. I am sure that my 2 yr old will get good use out of this in a few years too. Good value in my opinion."
4,Not exactly the same as the product picture,"I had to double check to make sure I received the correct dress because it looks slightly different in the product photo. The costume we received has a layer of tulle covering the entire skirt of the dress (which makes it seem a bit cheap). Maybe it's just me but I can't see the tulle from the picture. It also has a ribbon around the waist which doesn't seem to go with the dress. Regardless, my six-year-old loves it! For the money I paid, I am satisfied. The dress does have some loose threads which will need to be cut off and it came extremely wrinkled. My daughter wears a size 8 so I bought her the M (8/10) and it fits great. She is 48"" and weighs 58 lbs. I bought her sparkly pink shoes and a crown at Walmart to complete the outfit. She loves it and I guess that's all that matters!"
1,Horrible Quality!,"I usually do not write reviews maybe because I'm usually pleased with the product since I rely on product reviews before I buy anything. However, despite the high reviews, this dress, for the high price I paid of $29, is of HORRIBLE quality! I bought this costume for my daughter's 5th birthday and within 2 hours (no rough playing at all) the ribbon around the waist was unraveling. Also, as my daughter was dressing in and out of it throughout the day, large holes ripped in the outer netting in a few places. The feel of this dress is also very bad. I wouldn't have minded so much if I paid $10 for it, but definitely not worth $30!!!!! I am very dissatisfied."
4,Quirky compendium of bite-sized morsels.,"In this tidy little book of memoir/meditation, Martha Ronk surveys the field, ""from soup to nuts,"" of memorable or at least remembered foods. Although Ronk claims that she ""doesn't much like eating or cooking either for that matter,"" she does indeed fashion some delectable taste treats for her readers, wresting pleasure from ""displeasure"" with her evocative language. Food here is a starting point rather than a destination. And any particular food can lead in many directions. A great little book to have at hand to read in snippets, for example, at the breakfast table, on the bus, or while checking out the refrigerator."
2,"Expensive, difficult text for beginning philosophy student","I teach introductory philosophy at the college level and was assigned this book three years ago. While it does have a multi-cultural approach it is very expensive, the introductory sections are not all that good, and it fails to have a section by itself dealing with the issue of death, which is comparable to having a text on religion without a unit on God. There are better, much cheaper books that are better suited to beginning students of philosophy. I am changing using this text after continuing complaints from students about its difficulty and cost. Students are the best consumers here. Perhaps a two semester, more advanced course in philosophy might better use this text."
4,Book Review,This is a book that i needed for my philosophy class and it has done the trick for what I need in that class. Thank you for a great product!
5,Great Book,"When I first received this book in the mail, I was disappointed because it was a Harlequin Romance, but Anne Stuart proved once again that you can't tell a book by it's publisher. Excellent reading! Caleb Spencer has the perfect amount of bad boy in him to make him interesting. I only wish I knew when the tv movie was playing on Romance Classics so I could tune in."
4,Una Turandot interesante con reservas,"Lo mejor de esta version de la 'Turandot' pucciniana es sin duda la soberbia creacion de Liu que realiza Mirella Freni: voz bellisima y tecnica fantastica la convierten en una de las mejores Lius grabadas en disco. La Turandot de Montserrat Caballe une momentos de gloria con otros momentos gritados donde el papel la supera. Jose Carreras es un Calaf entregado y notable, aunque en la zona alta el papel le viene algo grande. Esplendido el Timur de Paul Plishka y notables los secundarios entre los que encontramos por ejemplo a Vicente Sardinero.La orquesta y el coro estan bien dirigidos por Alain Lombard, y el sonido es algo lejano, lo cual se puede arreglar subiendo el volumen de su cadena de musica."
4,The title says it all,"If you are thinking of buying a High-End Audio system, you need this book. Clear, and to the point advice, from somebody that really knows what thier talking about. Novices and fanatics alike can benefit from the wisdom within."
5,An Outstanding Reference For the Music Lover,"This book captures the spirit of high end audio. It is useful for those with no understanding of the high end audio community, as well as for those with a deep involvement in high end audio."
4,Four stars and a half .,"Anyone who wants to improve the sound performance of his/her audio setup will find in this books the nuts and bolts to achieving the task. Fully comprehensive texts without entering in too scientific issues. This by no means makes a book full of errors as someone wrote elsewhere. This is NOT an electronic or acoustic engineering textbook. Everyone should note it is intended to the audiophile whether he/she is or most probably not a graduate in audio engineering.Consider investing a couple of bucks more in your audio gear budget. After all, this book costs only a tiny portion of the cheapest device you'll probably buy. You'll not be dissapointed."
1,The Non-Thinking Persons Guide to Audio,"Not a book for anyone who has even the most basic understanding of electricity or circuit design. This book is rife with errors. The subtitle should be ""The Non-Thinking Persons Guide to Audio""."
2,Some useful info. Too much silliness,"As long as the author sticks to straight-forward info (such as explining why a pre-amp is often needed between a source component and a power amp) the book is useful. Too often, though, it degenerates into high-end silliness about interconnects, speaker wire, digital dither and the like. The author gets a bit pretentious when declaring that price and sound quality are not always related when he gives an example of $10,000 speaker vs. a more ""affordable"" product that goes only for $4,000!It's an ok book provided the reader keeps his/her BS detector powered up."
2,You have to be kidding me...,"And I thought that William Girdler couldn't get any worse than ASYLUM OF SATAN. Boy,was I wrong! This movie is truly idiotic, has no direction, and includes some of the worst acting that I've ever seen. And, you know what? It's a hoot and a half to watch. As teh back cover says, ""based on the crimes of Ed Gein,"" more like based on Casablanca. The movie, no lie, switches from horror/exploitation into romance half way through. I've watched this movie 3 times ever since purchasing it and I still can't figure one thing out: is this a spoof or is it dead serious? Anyways, watch for a ""spooky"" old man in a robe at the top of the stairs, Pa's speacial meat, random lines (ad libs?) such as ""spider man,"" ""Billy,"" and ""i'll go sleep in the shed."" Billy is the most lovable Pa's lil young'n in the history of all horror movies. Girder directed a very good movie once. I think it's called ""Boogie Man."" ""Boogie Man."" What a horrid name."
2,THREE ON A MEATHOOK,"Three on a Meathook is supposed to be based on the famous killer Ed Gein which also inspired films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Pyscho, and The Silence of the Lambs. However, it has virtually nothing to do with him. The killer lives on a farm and likes his dead mom, that's the only thing they have in common. The story, however, is a brutal, gory film packed with nudity and at times, some quite creative methods of death. The movie never truly seemed to have any direction, and constantly waves into new ones. The killer is obvious from the start, although the creators thought they were fooling us. Still, a true horror fan should see this just because hardcore horror fans should see alot of them, as well as these rare little numbers. Anyway, nothing special or new here, just a sometimes enjoyble sort of slasher flick."
2,"Good for documents, that's about it.","I've used this printer for around 3-4 months now, it works great for printing documents. However, it is quite often a pain to print on anything other than standard paper. You must manually feed in envelopes or higher quality paper such as photo paper since it will not feed from the tray. Often times with the manual feed you will get a paper width error because it is hard to feed the paper in straight. Quality of photos from this printer are so-so. I've seen much better and also have seen worse. The compact design is pretty nice although it is quite wide and deep. Overall, this is an ok printer for an average user that just needs to print documents. I would not recommend this for anything else. I am glad I only paid ten dollars for it......"
4,Good and,It needs to be updated. It is excellent as afar as it goes and so much has gone on since it was published.
5,Incredible for ANYONE!,"As a member of the subset of humans this book supposedly targets (single white hetero male), I can't recommend this damn book enough. Anyone who believes hatred or disrespect of any sort for any reason other than a person's actions will respect Ms. Paisan, and quite frankly, the section on depression practically saved my life during a bad spell a few years ago. Thank you, Diane Di Massa- if more people were like you, this world would be a lot better place to live in."
5,Compelling and Inspiring,I found the story to be both compelling and inspiring. The writer uses words in a way that the reader is drawn in. I mean you can actually visualize what she is vividly expressing. I am encouraged by her testimony.
5,Good mix of mystery and history,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a mystery set in current times with the events of 1923 when a white mob attacked a black town of Rosewood, Florida. The mystery unfolded well, covering both current happenings and past events. I found the flashback scenes fit into the story nicely, without being abrupt at all. Fascinating historical story, and I thought the relationship between Tory and David has matured quite nicely and believably."
5,From the Ashes,"A wonderful book from Aileen Schumacher! This Floridian engineer and author manages to integrate her fascinating series characters with a very true historical tragedy in ROSEWOOD'S ASHES. The sad story of what happened to the African-American community of Rosewood, Florida shows how much the nation has progressed, I hope."
4,NC is feeling that Miami sound!,I just received my copy of Ubiquity and Anonymity and I must say I was really feeling his style. The artist addressed issues that others are afraid to touch for fear of losing MTV-credibility! I live by the motto of 'to thine ownself be true' and on some level I believe Suice lives by the same creed! Keep banging baby!
4,"HOT, HOT, HOT!!!","I'm feeling SUICE on this one. It's like he took different points in my own life and put it to music. From FLIPPIN BRICKS to FREAKY CHICKS and all the drama that comes with it,If you lived it you would know. Keep doing your thing SUICE. ""20 MINS O' FAME"" ,about time somebody addressed those so called A&R's."
3,BANGIN' KID!,"YOOOOOO! I JUS'HEARD THE SAMPLES OF THIS JOINT AND I FEELIN' IT SO FAR. I'M ABOUT TO COP IT BECAUSE I'M SEMI-OPEN RIGHT NOW. I'LL PRBRABLY WILL BE DROPPIN' ANOTHER REVIEW WHEN I GET MY COPY, BUT I'M FEELIN' THIS JOINT SO FAR...OAKLAND BABY!"
1,Did not reach the shipment,Did not reach the shipment. You to inform you of. Was the amount of money recovered until today this is what happened to me
2,I will not buy from this company again,"It was not the product I ask, the product I ask was animale, and not Animale Animale I open the box thinking that change the presentation but it was a diferent product."
5,indispensable!,"I've had this book since high school and I still use it in college. I am a phil major and i constantly use it for reference and to prepare exams. I am always surprised to find entries like ""the test paradox."" It is a fun read and eveytime I pick it up I find myself spending more time on interesting entries than I expected."
5,The most useful one volume guide to Western philosophy,"I have found Oxford's Companion to Philosophy to be the most useful one volume guide to Western philosophy. I own and use the Routledge Concise Encyclopedia, the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, and Macmillan's eight volume Encyclopedia of Philosophy. However, the Oxford Companion to Philosophy is the book I now turn to first when I have a question regarding Western philosophy. Simply put: outstanding."
5,Great Companion,"I love this book. It's basically an abriged encyclopedia of philosophy, full of concise explanations about philosophers and philosophical themes. It's not perfect. Each entry is written by a different author, all of them university professors, many of them noted philosophers such as Searle, Singer, or MacIntyre. This necessarily means some entries are better written than others, and from time to time authorial bias seeps through and slants the way a theme or philosopher is presented. Nonetheless, almost every entry I've read has been at least interesting, and many have provided crisp, keen insights in a microscopic amount of space. It has enormous bookshelf value, and I keep it right next to my desk. Kudos to the publishers."
5,SUPERB AT ANY PRICE,"Put this one on your nightstand, and then read it every night, beginning on page one.As I said in the title, this book is ""superb at any price""."
4,Great for the autodidact in your family,"This is a tremendously helpful work. The work is written from the point of view of analytic philosophy, and thus tend to give short shrift to some thinkers in the continental stream. Still, the ""fathers"" of continental thought (Kant through Hegel, into Nietzche and Heidegger) are well represented and their philosophical works are amply dicussed and fairly treated. Overall, the articles are all that one might want from a ""companion to philosophy"" (and much of it is actually good reading) I frequently pull the beast (1000+ pages paperback) down from the shelf; that is the best thing I can say about it. You will not regret owning this book, no matter your philosophical bent. If you are a student, I cannot imagine how you have made it this far without it, one-stop encyclopedia can be great resources. Good job, Oxford Press."
3,One big ol' book of philosohy....,"I purchased this to have on-hand as a reference for my self-directed study of philosophy and am I glad I did. It's a great resource for comprehensive information on most of the major schools, thoughts, and practictioners in the science.As good as it is, there are some odd fluctuations in the quality of the individual essays; some are too obfuscatory for their own good (and for mine). Still, it is my #1 resource for additional information when I'm reading other philosophy books and I highly recommend this for the serious student of philosophy."
5,I wouldn't leave home without it,"Having gotten tired of going to the campus library to meticulously look up concepts, idealogies, philosophers and terms, I broke down and bought the new edition of the ""Oxford Companion to Philosophy."" I must say that it has helped me many times to better understand concepts and ideas of many philosophers and has subsequently helped to reduce the time I spent looking things up online or in other books. The entries are very detailed and very well written to explain and elaborate on the details that a student or any person may need clarification on. Since this edition is around 40 dollars I wouldn't buy this book just to have it on your bookshelf but if you are like me and sick of going to the library at night then get this book. It will not only provide a soilid definition but is a great place to start when researching."
3,not as great as I thought,They are definitely pretty but they run a bit small and narrow. Get a half size up!
4,Very pretty!,I love this shoe! Even though I can really only wear them with jeans and feel secure. It can really dress that look up alot.
5,Great Book,Tim Augustine is not only a great writer he is an excellent speaker!! I was able to hear him speak this weekend about networking and motivating your peers. Keep an eye out for other books by him because he has wonderful ideas and is incredibly enthusiastic about helping college students!
5,is is really helpful??,this book is really great especially for graduates who have not given an interview as yet. It really boosts your confidence.
5,Unbelievable,"Itzhak Perlman's artistry is unmatched, which is clearly evident in this set. His tone soars and resonates in a way that no musician can attempt to compare himelf with. Itzhak Perlman is one of the greatest artists of all time and this set is a tribute not only to his glory but to the glory of some of the greatest violin concerti ever written. The clarity and pureness of his music makes these recordings some of the best ever. This set is wonderful. I could not recommend it more highly."
4,Wildly imaginative,"Once again I am in two worlds, I absolutely love Goldsmith's score for the film, but I am sure the films score would last longer than 20 minutes. I am so glad that one Goldsmith score I know of has been released in its entirety, or as close as possible (eg. Poltergeist, which I own and love dearly)I don't understand why they cut it short. Seriously, those of us who are going to buy the score are a minority group so I can't see how cutting the music down is going to make it any more popular or marketable, I would care to say it would be the opposite.I'm sure there is a hell of a lot of Score lovers who would wholeheartedly agree.Anyway, Gremlins is a remarkable example of Goldsmith's ability to create a rich atmosphere that supports the movie and stands alone as truly visual and compelling music."
4,Classic Film On A Great DVD!,"GREMLINS is one of those rare films that works on so many levels: comedy, horror, children's film, looney tune. And it works perfectly for each. The gremlins are incredibly realistic (especially for 1984), and all but steal the show. And I love that bizarre, yet catchy main theme by Jerry Goldsmith. Actually, there isn't much more to say about the film than what has probably been said countless times in other reviews. All I can say is: SEE IT!! It's a classic all the way.The Special Edition DVD is well worth the fifteen bucks I spent at Borders. While the picture and sound aren't all that great (though it definitely passes), there's plenty of bonus features to be found. The documentary is pretty good, but my favorite extras are the deleted scenes. They're great!It's nowhere near as good as the sequal's DVD, but even so, this original is a must-buy."
5,My all time favorite Christmas movie,I rated it with the 5 five stars. The product was good. the clarity was just the same as if I watching the original show on tv.I bought it to watch at Christmas time.
4,Billy Peltzer has a cool green jacket,Gremlins is and always will be a classic. This DVD offers widescreen and regular formats which is really nice. It also has original trailers which are cool too see after so many years. My only complaint is that I saw Gremlins on TV a few years ago with special footage that was removed from the original. This DVD doesn't have those cut scenes. It would have been nice if it did.
3,Scary (for an 8 year old!),"I saw this movie when I was about 8 years old, and the father dressing up as Santa Claus and getting stuck in the chimney gave me nightmares for months afterwards. I could never watch it again!!"
5,Holiday classic,"An unexpected choice, but a classic scary Christmas movie nonetheless, Gremlins has held up surprisingly well. The actual Gremlins are too frightening for the youngest children, but it's a great film for families with older kids or adults who enjoy pratfalls and special effects."
5,"Gremlins - Still a fun, scary treat","This was a purchase for a 3 year old recovering from a major surgery. She loves scary movies. I wanted to get her something scary, but fun. I was glad to be able to purchase this dvd at a reasonable price."
5,Gremlins,"This is one of our favorite movies. Even my younger grandkids like it, because it's not ""scary "" scary, it's ""funny "" scary. We've watched it several times."
4,THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE DVD,"This DVD has great features, all including:*Over 10 MINUTES of never before seen footage*Behind the Scenes Documentary*Commentary By: Joe Dante, Phoebe Cates, Zach Galligan, Dick Miller, and Howie Mandel*Commentary By: Joe Dante, Michael Finnell, Chris Wales*Storyboard Gallery*Theatrical Trailer"
5,Jerry Goldsmith Does It Again,Joe Dante's 1984 film was a wild imaginative treat. Jerry Goldsmith as always matches the material and extends the madness musically. The result is an aural treat; lively and infectious and deftly suggesting the film's demented humor. It is a tragedy that so many of Goldsmith's scores (including this one and especially UNDER FIRE) are not currently available.
5,AWESOME,I'm quite happy with the shipping time and complete accuracy of the description. I would gladly purchase with this seller again!
3,Gremlins video on blue ray,This wasn't my favorite movie but the rest of my family loved it. In the first half it was all cute and seemed like a good family movie but in the last half there was violence and gore.
2,Gremlins,"Poor writing, poor acting, predictible etc. My main beef, though, is the scene where Phoebe Cates' character tells the story about how she found out there wasn't really a Santa Claus. Be warned before watching this with young children. I wish I had been!!"
2,case broken,The case for the DVD was broken when it arrived and cannot be closed and the DVD was loose in the packaging.
1,Horror gone B-Movie funny...,"...You watch it and find yourself sucked into an otherwise story by numbers movie (hey, the old guy says ""no sunlight, water or food after midnight"" so you're warned what to expect already). Main criticism of course is its lack of focus on the hilarious antics of the evil Gremlins (something the sequel did a little better) who destroy a good portion of a town, but aren't seen nearly enough to make you detest them - instead they're little more than pests. The level of gore is surprising, which is how you can tell that this isn't technically a ""kids"" movie, so care should be taken with young children (but saying that I'd have been 7 when I saw this and had no problem....but then Nightmare on Elm Street might have desensitised me a bit by that time) but it's essential viewing if only so that you can watch the sequel too."
4,Best Christmas movie ever.,"Forget Ralphie, Jimmy Stewart or Charlie Brown. If you are going to buy one Christmas movie, this is it. Joe Dante balances horror, camp and comedy like few others can. The animatronics still look great. Just don't feed this movie after midnight."
5,Gremlins,Purchased as a gift for a young boy who justrecently saw Gremlins and wanted a copy ofhis own. He was very happy to get it and theDVD quality was excellent
4,Gremlins,"I was able to enjoy this classic Holiday movie with my young niece and nephew, who may have enjoyed the movie more than me! Will watch it again next year!"
4,A 1980s Classic!,"I was just a young teenie when Gremlins came out and turned into a huge success. I enjoyed it very much back then, and today, I still enjoy watching this Classic once in a while. It has just everything that a film should have. Excitement, thrills, love, friendship, evil versus good, and not least: humour! Furthermore, Gremlins is very well made.Don't miss this film! It's one of those that you simply have to have seen. A true classic!!"
2,Keep your DVD,"This is not worth the upgrade for the cost it is going at right now. WB did not remaster Gremlins for Blu-Ray. In my opinion (and many others) the BD is only a small improvement over the DVD. I'd say the improvement in clarity and detail varies between 5%-30% better throughout the film. The audio is much better though, really fun to hear the score in HD audio. Wait till the price drops, then pick it up."
4,good to go,"This was my first purchase on amazon, and i have to say it opened the door to weekly dvd purchases since then. great quality and exactly what i wanted."
4,Pretty good but to scary for small children.,"Well not really a horror film this film still has some pretty grim pieces in it which may not be very good for small children(mainly the infamous microwave scene).But other then that this film is quite fun and has a few good laughs.It is mainly a fantasy film about a boy that gets a mysterious pet for christmas.He is also told three rules which I am sure you know(if you don't just watch the film they tell you quite a few times).Well the rules are broken and the result is a bunch of mean little creatures that terrorize a town.Then the boy,Billy is his name,teams up with his pet and his girlfriend to stop them.A pretty good story and a good film."
3,:/,I hope this item is okay. When I got it in the mail the cd was not secured in the case. It's a christmas present so i hope it plays okay. :/
5,Classic,Love this movie. I remembered it as funny when I was a kid and seeing it again i was not disappointed.
3,gremlins an ok movie,"Gremlins is an ok movie it was a little boring at some scences. It had good acting,a good story. It is thrilling, creepy, and good ege of your seat movie. But it wasnt the greatest horror movie."
4,A great movie,Simply superb special effects. Definitely under-rated movie. I am glad to see it released on DVD. It's definitely going to be in my collection.
5,Gremlins,"Gremlins is a funny movie. it is about a guy who gets a gremlinfor christmas. the guy his dad bought it from said not to get it wet, put it in bright lights,or feed it after mid-night.then the guy acidentaly spills water on it then the gremlin makes lots of babys. then later, the babys get hungry at about 11:30 PM.but the gremlins bit the cord on the clock so it didn't work, and it really was after midnight. and the guy feeds them. but gizmo, the first gremlin, isn't hungry. then they all turn into these monsters. after that it gets pretty violent.there is blood and explosions. this movie should be PG-13 instead of PG. you should buy it"
5,Billy and Gizmo what a love couple,"Billy has a new pet that his father gave to him as a christman present. He brought it all they way from Japan he names the fury creature Gizmo. It does come with a set of rule #1 keep away from bright light he hates it especially sun light which could kill him, #2 don't get him wet with water let along giving him a bath, #3 the most important rule never ever feed him after midnight cause if that happen's he create an egg then he'll hatch out into a gremlin and turning bad."
5,Very Informative,Anyone that has an interest in gardening and their contribution to Carbon Dioxide emissions should read this book. It is a quick read and explains the science of carbon balance in an easy to understand way.
2,START WITH NCAST,"I highly recommend starting with NCAST (baby cues)...the last CUE you want your baby to give you is a cry....a baby will use body language to tell you the exact same thing as the cry so why let them cry? When an infant cries the brain releases certain chemicals that have an effect on the neuro transmitters. After 35 seconds of crying those effects may become adverse. I am sure your baby will open its mouth, root (turning head into body), stick tongue out, make noises, etc BEFORE it will cry to tell you that it is hungry....that applies to all of the other ""cries"" as well....so don't waste your time or money on this please."
2,Eager,"I will be a first time mother (due in 3 months ) and I first heard about this on Oprah. I thought it was interesting at the time. I just read a few of the reviews and I was a bit skeptical at first about purchasing the DVD because of the negative reviews, but then I thought about how frustrating things can be as a first time mother and not being able to understand what my baby will be trying to say. So I am actually looking forward to viewing it. Even if it is 15-20 min on 2 disc... I'm sure it will be worth it in the long run when I am up at 2 am in the morning trying to figure out why my baby is fussing and how to soothe her. Mother intuition is best above all which I'm sure will be acquired along the way, but every little bit helps. The price I thought was okay... since I was originally going to purchase it on DunstanBaby.com (56.00)."
2,Overpriced for amount of info...,These videos are over priced for what they contain... although there is good information and demonstrations (ie. different burping/gas relieving positions) it wasn't THAT useful... slightly dissapointed as a new mom.
1,Do not waste your money!,"Seriously I can't believe this is a best selling DVD. I should have listened to all the other bad reviews. This is so bad that we couldn't even watch the second CD. If you get to know your baby at all you will know what they need when they cry. And even if you don't, just try burping, feeding, rocking or swaddling them and one of those will probably work and you will have saved your money and time watching this dumb thing."
1,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Am a first time mom and bought this book thinking i would learn a thing or two about new borns. I was very disappointed with this product and regreted having bothered buying it. If i could return the product i would. The content have no substance, very poorly narrated and some of what's discussed are things that are so obvious that even a 10 year old would know to do. There were two CD's that came in the case and i barely watched the first one, that's how terrible it was. Save your money for something educative and worth buying. Very amateur production."
3,Little Overpriced,"I found this DVD pretty interesting and actually helpful. I am a mother of a 6-week old baby and sometimes it was frustrating to figure out what he was 'saying'. Now, instead of thinking he's always hungry and trying to feed him, I know when he's actually sleepy and not hungry. For learning the difference between when he's hungry and when he's sleepy, this DVD was worth it. I think there's no need for 2 DVDs, all the content could be easily fit on 1 DVD. I also think it's a little pricey, I think the right price would have been in low $20s. But overall, it's a good buy."
3,It's ok.,"I watched it twice, only used the word Nah when I had my baby. The Eh, and the grunts you can figure out on your own."
4,Very informative,"The information was very informative. However, I would have liked to have seen more images of real babies (instead of dolls) when she spoke of ways of dealing with different cries. Overall, an informative DVD. It could have been put on one DVD."
3,Good but overpriced,"I think she's on to something, but she could have said it on one DVD and had it cost less. I agree with other reviewers who said that the DVD could have gone more into the experiences of the workshop participants.As for the value of the information: Neh (hunger) was the best one. Eairh (sound babies (and adults, for that matter) make when they are struggling to poop) and Owh (yawn) are totally intuitive no-brainers. And it's next to impossible to distinguish between Eh (upper gas) and Heh (discomfort). So my main take-away was knowing the difference between hunger and not-hunger.If you do get this DVD, get it very early. The language only applies to the first three months. And knowing it can keep you a little more sane in those first few days with a new baby when all you're feeling is panic and frustration. After three months, as things settle down, you get to know intuitively what your baby is ""saying"" anyway."
3,Not worth the $$,"I do think that she is on to something here and truly has good knowledge to share. However, I felt that the price of the DVD was way too expensive for what you get. I didn't learn anything I didn't know from research on the Dunstan language and through watching the Oprah recap on YouTube. I thought she had a good idea, wanted to be loyal to a good idea, and I wanted to learn more but was bummed when I spent a pretty penny on the DVD and didn't learn a darn thing... I felt that the DVD was a waste of money- you could get the same info through a 10 minute Oprah recap for free."
4,Saw it all on Oprah,"I was introduced to Dunstan Baby Language from watching the Oprah Winfrey Show. I thought that this was amazing and with my wife about to deliver our second child, I thought that it was a must have. I was disappointed when I watched the two disc to find that everything that I was on the discs was shown on the Oprah Show. There was nothing really more for us to know. Though, for parents who are having their first child and did not see the Oprah Show, please buy these disc. They are well worth the money spent. The videos are well spaced out with examples of different crying babies, so after awhile, you are able to recognize what your baby is trying to say to you. Really! It is amazing! Burbing, feeding, diaper, gas, discomfort. It is all there right in front of our faces. Right now, we have a very content baby. We are enjoying or time interacting with our newborn instead of trying to figure out what he is trying to say to us."
3,"Good, but not what I thought","I ordered this DVD after I saw the woman on an Oprah clip. I thought it would be nice to have the DVD to learn MORE about her system and hear from real-life people who had good experiences with it. Well, I should have just bookmarked the Oprah clip, as it was just about as informative and free. The first DVD only had about 10 minutes of actual instruction on it. The workshop (if you can call it that) participants don't speak at all, and there are only short clips of babies making the sounds. I wouldn't have ordered the DVD if I knew what was going to be lacking on it."
4,"Very helpful information, although a bit pricey!","My baby is 17 days old and I have been using this technique successfully from day one! Knowing what my newborn's cries mean right off the bat not only meant my little guy has never had to cry for more than 2 minutes (except for a few gassy episodes where it took a while to burp him), but it has given me wonderful confidence as a new mom!The first time I heard his ""hungry cry"" I was amazed it was so clear to me. If I didn't know what his hungry cry sounded like, both he and I would have had some very frustrating times, since some days he is simply extra hungry (growth spurt maybe) and the last thing I would have thought he needed was to eat again so soon. But his hungry cry let me know thats what he wanted!I gave it 4 stars because while the info is very helpful, it really could have been broken down into a 10 minute DVD. It is kind of a joke that 5 little words are stretched out into 2 DVDs. But still I would recommend it!"
3,"More production than substance, still helpful","I was a bit surprised by how little there is on this two-DVD set. The entire content could be explained in about three minutes (as was seen on Oprah and is floating the net in various articles), but somehow takes a little over an hour. Bonus Features include testimony by mothers on how helpful this video is, as well as a small group with their infants, and Dunstan explaining what each cry means.That's about it in a nutshell - 5 types of cries and their associated responses.What's missing is all the other language cues - the nonverbals. Sure, there's a particular sound the baby makes due to tongue position, etc, but what about if she's got her back arched, or if he's got his hands in his face? This would be far more useful if the cries were incorporated in these terms, especially when dealing with breastfeeding, trying to get to sleep, colic and all the other challenges that new parents face."
5,AMAZING! A MUST-HAVE FOR FIRST-TIME PARENTS,"I still don't know how come no one told me about this dvd before I gave birth. I think it should be recommended by OBGYN as soon a new pregnancy is confirmed. :-)) Of course, each baby makes more than 5 different sounds, but this dvd surely helps with the most basic ones. As a first-time parent I found this to be a life-saver.My girl is a much happier baby now and I'm more confident and much calmer.The most helpful part of the dvd is the examples of different cries and sounds. It really demonstrates what to look and listen for..however, even though I absolutely LOVE this product, I think it's extremely overpriced. Get it in the library or buy a used one, but definitely get it. You won't be disappointed!!"
5,Dunstan Baby Language,This product was listed on my son's and daughter-in-law's baby registry as it was highly recommended to them. They told me they were pleased with it.
3,Crying Review,"When my son was born, my Aunty came to visit us at the hospital at the hospital & gave me a piece of paper with all the different cries & what they meant.I didn't give it much thought until I found it later on, after being home from hospital.I tried listening in for similar noises. The only one that matched the page was 'neh'.I thought it was quite cool that baby has different sounds for their needs. We didn't follow the sounds religiously as we discovered that baby had his own tones that we started to understand. Now that hes over the 3 months Ive noticed some changes in his sounds & learning all over again what they mean.Its good to know that there are sounds for each request from baby & I think that's the main lesson!Thanks for putting your time into putting effort into helping a parent/baby bond grow!"
2,Really? Don't waste your money!,"This DVD teaches mothers nothing that they don't learn on their own in the first 2 weeks. If you are extremely left brained and need explanations and rules for everything then this is for you,otherwise this is just a way for a woman to make money off what all mothers do instinctually. You will only learn 5 words on this 2 DVD set."
2,Product gets B-; Email system gets an F,"This is a good product that was insightful and somewhat useful. Although, my baby obviously did not speak the same baby language that she does. More importantly, her email system is a nightmare and do not try and order this direct from her website... When I did it showed up on my CC statement 3 times and when I emailed them to resolve it, I got on some kind of spam list that has me (and others) receiving ""unsubscribe"" emails from all over. It's pretty crazy!! If you want this product, order from Amazon and God help you if you have to email them directly!!"
2,useless!,"Very interesting, but id say its a waste of money. You'll get to know your babys cries in the first couple months. Just keep your eye on the clock and make sure he's fed and changed often. This is two dvds, each less than 10 minutes. Why?"
2,Not worth it,"I bought this very impressed with a youtube video that showed what appears to be a word in common for babies to ask for food. Cool. Video not cheap by any means... after I watch this video several times, I am very disappointed. Not much more than the youtube video and the lady speaking is like - if your babey says 'neh' the babey us hungry. This is the time to feed your babey. I would return it if I could. If you have nothing better to do, buy this dvd. Horrible value for the price."
3,Maybe should have bought it earlier?,"I heard about this from my mother-in-law. Several people said they'd heard about it or seen it on Oprah. I thought I'd give it a shot. We watched the first DVD (I agree with other reviewers...2 DVD's are definitely unnecessary). It was interesting, I suppose. Our baby was about three months old at the time (maybe four??). She still had her fussy moments, but not nearly as bad as those first couple months...and she's really a good, happy baby overall. We recognized her cries for about a week or two, then either it was hard to tell or maybe we just got lazy about it. Now, at 6 months, her signals are more whines than anything. Her only crying now is usually in the carseat."
5,Get it BEFORE you have the baby,"Best product to give for a shower gift. Your ear gets used to the specific crys BEFORE the baby comes. At the Hospital I could already determine what my son needed, it was so great to see an INSTANT result. With my first son I was always guessing or just feeding him, now that I can tell the differences between the cries my 2nd son sleeps longer, eats better and is hardly ever fussy!!!!GET IT and Share it with EVERY NEW MOM to BELisa"
2,"Helpful info, but WAY overpriced","The substance of the information contained in this 2 DVD series, which we purchased for $40.00, could easily be communicated in a 15 minute DVD. It was helpful for a new mom, but I was annoyed it was broken up into 2 DVDs that were vastly overpriced.Skip buying it new, and find a used copy on Craigslist, or borrow a friends. Or watch the Oprah segment."
5,newborn babies,"Dunstan baby Language DVD it's really useful I loved it. now i can understand my baby we he needs milk or sleep time I can't say more than wonderful DVD.Regards,"
1,Not Very Useful,"This product is proof that parents will spend anything on even the glimmer of hope that they can make their baby happier and maybe get a bit more sleep at 3 AM. But it is only a glimmer of hope. Fortunately, the real solution isn't much harder and it is a whole lot less money than the price of this.Ok, I'll admit there is some similarities to the sounds my baby makes but only some. As a parent, you'll quickly learn the signs that your baby needs to be burped, has gas, is hungry, or is uncomfortable.How? By watching your baby. It really is that simple, but it isn't quite as simple as this product makes it out to be.Save your money and spend a couple bucks on a paper journal and keep track of the sounds and facial expressions your baby makes. And what you did to make her stop crying."
1,Didn't Work On My Baby,"I saw her on Oprah and really really wanted to believe it was going to work. Sadly, it didn't work on my baby but I am thrilled to hear it's worked for other people."
2,Not worth it,"If you can google this video online under youtube, then don't buy this item! This is barely an hour worth of video for $38 and most of it is testimonials. It's professionally videotaped, but yet she stumbles through her words at times! The only impt word is ""nie"" which means the baby if hungry, and even so ... not always accurate. My baby after falling asleep b/c he's so full will say ""nie"" 20 mins later! And he won't take another bottle, so he's not hungry!"
4,"I bit Pricey but if it works, worth every penny","I just watched this last night and I was really surprised. Our baby is still 4 weeks away so I can't say if it's going to work and thus I did give it 4 stars because I'm pretty confident this is going to be a useful tool for us. It makes sense and I believe it's going to really give us a leg up in carring for our newborn. I'm not sure why it needed to be two disks, it's actually not that long and it seems to be a little pricey. BUT... with that said if it works then its worth every penny and then some.I'll let you know!"
2,"Save the money, watch it on Oprah","I found this low-budget product incredibly overpriced. None of her techniques are actually demonstrated on babies. She uses dolls to show the techniques. I saw her on Oprah in the summer of '06, and everything you need to know was during that show. If you can find it, just watch the archive of the show and save the money.The basic cries are inconsistent in my newborn, but occasionally helpful. Trial and error with diaper changes, burping, and nursing gets me the same results.Overall, for a nervous first time mom or desperate parent it might not be bad. We are first-timers and found the info interesting but not very useful."
2,It may work for our baby...,"It may work for our new born baby, but I don't think that spending $40.00 USD for a DVD is worth it. To learn the 5 baby words, we spend a total of 36-minutes and means of addressing them. Another 24-minutes is bonus material as to ""what parents are saying"". All in all, you get 1-hour worth of material, that appears to have been taped in one take, should be costing no more than $10.00 USD. If you want to get 90% of the DVD content, search for ""Oprah"" and ""Dunstan"" and you will find the episode which covers pretty much everything on the DVD."
3,Interesting theory,"We purchased this DVD in anticipation of our first baby due any day now. I'm not sure if the baby language will actually work, but it doesn't hurt to give it a shot! My first impression after watching the DVD is that it's quite overpriced for what you are getting. It's 2 DVDs, but each only has about 15-20 minutes of content, most of which is watching examples of babies making the sounds. I think this DVD should be at least half the price and consolidated onto 1 DVD. The DVD also comes with a nice, big fold-out pamphlet with the reminders of the sounds and what they mean. I think this will come in very handy instead of watching the DVD all over again. I will update my post again after I have actually put the theory into practice, but so far, the above is my first impression."
4,WHOA,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, subtitles and all. It was fun. It had a little bit of everything in it...romance...drama...and action. The kiss at the end was worth the wait. I have just started watching Bollywood movies and I cannot grasp this ""no kissing policy"" in all their films. Oh...they can bump and hip grind each other and do just about everything that gives the impression of copulation, but no kissing? I find it ludicrous!I would have given this five stars but the third person dialogue of Aishwarya Rai's character had me rolling my eyeballs. What was up with that? As far as Bollywood movies are concerned, cheesy as most of them are, this one had some integrity. Worth the watch!"
1,Friends Don't Let Friends Watch Dhoom 2,"Just a dreadful film. While the original had it's moments, making it a guilty pleasure, the returning characters are just so annoying as to suck any joy out of this misfire."
4,Fantastically Awful,"Now I'm sure that my tastes aren't the same as everyone's, however, I am a fan of 'so bad it's good' type films. And this is one of the best. As stated in the other review of this film I just read, there are plastic eyes aplenty, overly red blood and a cover that does not even tally with the film itself. Fantastically awful, I loved it!"
1,Utter rubb-ish,"The cover of this garbage had a little warning that read ""Too gory for the silver screen!!"", and the back had some photos of some horribly mutilated corpse that for some reason wernt even in the film. And now having watched the headless eyes, i simply cant understand the logic behind such hype. This movie makes scream look like a gorefest, and most of the gore described is not even in the film. unless of course plastic eye balls, and absolutly pathetic fake blood that looks exactly like Hersheys syrup is considerd gory... im also wondering why the hell the dead bodys on the back of the case wernt even in the film... to sum it up... pathetic...utterly pathetic."
4,"Good Book, but pay attention...","That's an excellent book...however, don't think this is another book from Dan Brown...that's exactly the same book as Angels and Demons...German version. Once again, same book, different title!"
1,Need to CLEARLY indicate that this is in German,"I bought the book thinking Dan Brown had produced yet another work I would enjoy. I was quite disappointed to learn, after I got it, that it is the German langauge version of Angels and Demons. This is not indicated anywhere on the page with the book. Thankfully, my mother-in-law is German and will enjoy it. Somebody at Amazon needs to clarify the online for things that are not 'standard'"
1,Illuminati,"I feel cheated by the publisher! This is ""not"" a new book by Dan Brown called Illuminati but in fact ""Angels and Demons"" in german. I read Angels and Demons in english and enjoyed it very much. How is it possible that just because it's in german, a book can be published under a different title. So much for honesty in publishing! This is yet one more reason for not ordering through Amazon..."
1,Too Fictional,This book is too much of a fairy tale. Rodney St.Michael's book Illuminati:Healing and Developing the Mind (ISBN: 0595259669) gives a better understanding on Dan Brown and Ron Howard's themes.
4,Pop culture at it's best and worst!,"I really enjoy Aqua's music and style, so it is no surprise that I enjoyed this CD (especially the first three tracks!).....the perfect CD to listen to when you feel like the world is just giving you too much stress to handle. A lot of stupid and crazy lyrics, but fun!"
4,Get it for Lene,The reason this got 4 stars is cause there is too much focus on the guys. Lets face it people. Aqua is famous because Lene is a superbabe. Other than that the music is good. Hopefully on the next album they will have more Lene.
4,Not Too Bad,"I personally enjoyed this album very much. Although Aquarium will always be my favorite, this album has it's own interesting and entertaining qualities. There are two or three songs that I really don't care for too much, but everyone's taste is differentt. But if you are a true Aqua fan, this is a great CD to own!"
4,Good like the first one,"This album is simular to their first one, perhaps even better musically but it sold less then their great debut though. I don't know but only 3 songs were released on singles on the album, where of 2 became big selling in Europe. I think the reason they quit after this album was that they all had so many diffrent interests, they simply wanted to do something else. This album is more pure pop then their first one which was a mix between dance and pop. There is a good varity of songs here too. The best song is the pop song ""Cartoon heroes"" Then we have ""Dance-pop song ""Around the world"" and ""Bumble Bees"" with a trademark video too. Latin sinpired ""Cuba Libre"" and Ballads like ""We belong to the sea"" which is very good and ""Aquarius"". The album finnish with a farewll song ""Goodbye to the circus"" they sing ""we will be back"" but they haven't, atleast not yet. If you liked the first album, get this one too, it's good and fun."
2,"No as good as Aquarium, their first CD.","I am a dance/techno entushiats. I think their first CD, Aquarium, is better than this one. Aquarium has happier music and are more like to be dance tracks. I found ""Cartoon Heroes"" too much comercial. ""Around the World"" is fine. There are other fine musics also, but I bought this CD expecting something like ""Barbie Girl"", ""Dr. Jones"", ""My oh My"", ""Lollipop"", ""Roses are red"" or ""Turn Back Time"", but this CD was disappointing to me."
2,Falls Way Short of the First CD,"Aquarius tries to emulate the same annoyingly catchy sound as Aqua's first CD (Aquarium), yet falls way short. Despite a few catchy songs, the lyrics and melodies are almost too ridiculous. And the only reason I say almost is b/c Aqua has created many great songs on their first CD using horrendously ... lyrics, yet made it work. If you're looking for a good club/dance CD, buy the first one which (I think) 80% of the songs are great (notice I don't say it has substance though). Stay away from this ...."
2,Not as good as Aquarium,"To say it, this album was much different from the group's first album, 'Aquarium'. The songs, with the exception of 'Bumble Bee', are basically about nothing but strange subjects. The song 'Halloween' just freaked me out, and Cuba Libre? Let's just say I had no idea what THEY were trying to say. Not quite rock, pop, romance, or even rap. Maybe Aqua could start their own category--Aquatic!"
2,Bad Followup (In My Opinion),"I am going to try not to be as positive as possible. First, this CD did not capture me at all and I was not interested in it one bit. Unlike it's US debut ""Aquarium"" which was really fun, in a cheesy sort of way. This was way too cheesy for me. None of the songs were that good and I can't even remember one that I liked. I gave it 2 stars only because I loved their debut CD and liked this CD on the 2nd time around, but not the 1st or the 3rd. It think that you should purchase ""Aquarium"" instead, but get some other opinions before you make your final decision. Who knows, you might really like it as many people have here at Amazon.com! But, this CD was nothing for me, a flop. Most of the public agreed with me on this one, too. Enjoy!"
2,repetative and boring,"This album is a total let down. After listening to Cartoon Heroes, the first track, and then the 2nd track, I was thinking ""hey this might be a good album"". Man was I ever disappointed. Too many ""slow"" jams, and the dance songs are just retarded. The content and lyrics is for 7 year olds at best."
3,For a severely restricted audience.,"If you are female, 12 or under, idolize celebrity phantasms and imaginary beauty icons, and are not of the brainy bent, then this is for you. Everyone else ought to really think twice before heaping praise on a neo-Ace-of-Base electropop rehash."
2,repetative and boring,"believe you me, its not worth buying. Download Cartoon Heroes and spare yourself the rest of the album."
1,"Silly, untoughtful and drained of all the fun","Their first album was listenable, but this album proves that you can't go making 20 listenable songs with the same beat, same hook, and more silly lyrics. They are funny, maybe provocative in a never-never land kind of way, but that's as far as this album goes. I respect them for making the music they enjoy, but it's hard to find any talent behind all the cartoon creativity. This is a flop, just another bubble gum, disposable collection of shallow songs. If you like silly songs, with no meanings, and if you don't pay attention to lyrics, and 50 minutes of the same continous beat, this is the album for you. Otherwise, stay away from Aqua, and rely on the talents and masterminds of true pop music such as Madonna or Ace of Base."
3,If Only....,"The problem with Aqua is their music is so melodically wonderful that when they put simple lyrics to it, they scare a lot of people away. Imagine if they made the lyrics more serious similar to Turn Back Time in their first album. I believe the standout songs in the new album are Back From Mars (even though I am still a little confused about what the song intends to say),Aquarius (which is THE standout song) and Good Guys. I think this album is no better than the first and no worst than the first. I would really like Aqua to get a new lyricist that could really use words to enchance the music further."
4,Aqua can change you're bad mood into the party vibes.,"Aquarius... Well. A new name for the Album with practically the same music and new text, but the band still got that incredible ability to bring everybody in the mood for dancing. I think the whole idea of Aqua's CDs is to make people happier, at least while you're listening this CD you'll never get bored. Why? Because the mood will be there all the time! I gave 4 stars, because this CD is the one what i am listening after work... Just for having a good time and forget about any worries."
5,Back from NeverNeverLand,"Amazing album, expected of the amazing group that gave us Barbie Girls, Happy Boys and Girls, and Turn Back Time. This pop-funk album is a follow-up on their highly-successful first album Aquarium, and this one is slightly self-titled, Aquarius. Tracks like Cartoon Heroes are catchy and fun to listen to, and on a weekend morning the music is just happy and brightens up a day. A combination of Lene's cartoonish-cute voice, and Rene's cheeky-sounding growl make for very nice music and pop. Now disbanded, it brings back many memories, and is worth every cent of it."
5,Nice product,"I recommend it, really worth its price, comfortable , good quality, and looks really good."
3,"Buy it just for ""Saint Marc""","This collection contains an exceptional performance of Albinoni's Concerto ""Saint-Marc"" in transcription for the piccolo trumpet. The work appears here in the valve-friendly key of B-flat, in comparison to the original key of A for the violin. The work has almost no significance in that instrument's repertoire. The trumpet community has adopted it as its own, and although it is quite a blow on the brass instrument, the work is frequently performed. Jean Thilde did the editing and Maurice Andre has done the beautiful embellishments. He is one of the master's of the instrument afterall, and a great contributor of transcriptions to the trumpeters' library of works. I find the rest of the disc forgettable - but at this price, buy it for Andre's performance."
3,Adagio organ sound inappropriate,The organ employed for the adagio sounds very weak and lacking any depth or passion - it misses my soul by a mile.
3,"A ""transition"" album by the Dots","This was the second actual LP release by the Dots (not including the dozen or so cassette-only releases the Dots put out around this time), and I see it as largely a transitional album. It contains some simple, kooky material played over primitive keyboards such as ""Lisa's Party"" and ""Soma Bath."" These tracks are reminiscent of their first album (Brighter Now). However, it also contains some longer, more ambitious tracks (such as the closing, ten minute or so ""Stoned Obituary"") which prefigure their later work. For some reason, however, ""Stoned Obituary"" falls flat; its religious iconoclasm seems a bit crass and over-obvious, and the music is too repetitive and lacks imagination. On later albums, the Dots would rectify these short-comings as they gained in confidence and technical ability."
5,"Sing forever,... really clever!","This is one of my very favourite Dots CDs. Even though the new cover art really sucks compared to the original, the music is still as clever/funny as ever. Lyrics to ""Lisa's Party"" and ""Doll's House"" (which may very well be my most beloved Dots song) will not leave your head. The songs may be a little too keyboard-ish for some listeners, but for me, you'd be hard pressed to find better!"
1,defective disk,I bought this and found that when I played it the disk skipped tracks constantly. From 1 to 10 then to 22 then to 9 without any sense at all. This makes me think this CD should be avoided at all costs.
2,NICE TRICK,"the product I have no complaint regular air tool oil, like any you can buy in a harware store with out the shipping cost the problem is thatWhen I open the page and see that big metal gallon can, for that amount, I got exited, WOWWW what a deal,(dint read nothing) when I received I was very DISAPPOINTED small plastic 32 onz. Like the product information on AMAZON,and I say too my self why did I read the product title, before I order it. One little (blink) mistake on this life, and someone is going too make you fill BAD,is only a quart why they did put a picture of a small plastic can, exactly as the product they are selling and sending, is not too important the amount of money, is the way it make you fill, VERY MAD, and also lost all that trust I have for AMAZON for many years I been a good customer."
3,"caution, does not play with wii sports resort","This played with the wii motion plus controllers, but when you try to play archery with it, it does not work, otherwise, this is just as good as the nintendo brand ones. not a bad product if you are not going to use it during the sports resort."
1,Didn't last long.,I bought them in a 2 pack. I liked them at first but we don't use them a lot and now both have failed. The Nintendo brand nunchuk still works fine.
5,UPDATE: BE CAUTIOUS! Both of mine broke with 2 months! :( GRRR...,"Used this for a month now, no trouble. I like the grips and so far seems just as good as nintendo's nunchuks (and I paid less too).UPDATE: BE CAUTIOUS! Both of mine broke with 2 months! :( GRRR..."
2,Wii Can't Play,"There is no question that with Nintendo drawing a close to the Nintendo Wii, and focusing its emphasis on the uscoming Wii U, many gamers are eager to see Nintendo's next big step. But, with the Nintendo Wii, there are some accessories that not even Nintendo would consider recommending. That is the case with Intec's Wii wired nunchuck controller. The device is not really a strong bet if you need a extra peripheral for the Nintendo Wii. Not only does it not handle well when you play games like Super Mario Galaxy, and The Legend Of Zelda: Skyward Sword, but can easily cost you the game. Overall, if you need another nunchuck add-on, you are just better off with getting one from Nintendo itself.Price: D-Control: DOverall: D 1/2-"
3,"Excellent, but only for awhile","I really enjoyed the first 200 pages of this book, but after that I found it repetitious. How often do I want to go with Erlich through her struggles about a kosher kitchen? How often do I want to hear how terrific her mother-in-law is? That woman's perfectionism would have gotten on my nerves if I were her daughter-in-law. I know she suffered horribly through WWII, but I don't think that's a reason to assume she's now some kind of saint. Anyhow, I liked the childhood memories a lot - many were like my own. And the writing, if a bit flowery, is very good. I finished the book and was glad it finally ended."
3,Book finds the transcendent in the ordinary,"Ok, so I'm like a Hawaiian/Chinese guy living in San Francisco who picks this book up and finds it to be the first in a long time that moves him to tears. Sometimes it's like visiting a parallel universe - for a goy to understand why his hand gets slapped from the butter dish at his Jewish friend's houses - and at others, it's a beautifully written account of how a working woman in the 90s (re)discovers her immigrant heritage. I think this book will touch anyone with immigrant roots; all of us can identify with the hard work, sacrifice, and the scents that emanate from our mothers' kitchens. Those scents will always signify - home, and this book captures those scents in an elegant bottle."
3,"Bordering on good, but too heavy handed by the end","The book began with great promise--a connection to the past via ritual, religion and food--but a serious editor would have improved it by cutting 1/3--which would allow the author to make her lovely treatise without repeating the same points numerous times. When the author, for example, linked kosher pizza orders with the kosher rituals of ages past--I thought, ""enough already, she's made that point many times."" But she continued to make it and others like it again and again. This is all the more irritating because of the potential of the book."
3,"A book that transports, but the editing could be better.","Having grown up Jewish in a secular house, with grandparentswho kept kosher and walked to shul on the holidays, thisbook spoke to me. Ehrlich paints a wonderful picture of theprevious generation and the things that gave meaning not just to their lives but to the lives of the families they raised.The recipes are a wonderful addition to the book and theybring me back to both my grandmother's and my mother's kitchen.I'm thankful to say my mother is still a wonderful cook and Iam collecting all of her recipes to pass on to my children.My one criticism of the book is that it is poorly edited. I find some of the sentence structures to be very awkward. I almost didn't continue reading the book because I found the writing to be less than elegant but... the subject matter drew me in. It was a worthwhile read for me but I wish the writing were better."
5,"not my generation, BUT....",I purchased this book for my mom. She called me 3 days later-crying over what a beautiful GIFT this book was to her and how it stirred such beautiful memories of her family and especially her grandmother.
3,"Average Quality, excellent price!","These BB pellets are sort of the rough, irregular quality pellets one expects in an unexpensive bulk package at this low price. They work OK, but they will effect accuracy and have a very disappointing habit of jamming in some of my air rifles. It seems that the better the air rifle, the more likely they are to jam. The least expensive Chinese air rifle seems to like them the best.So, use accordingly and if you need a better product, try the GAMMO."
3,Hard to find.,"But don't kid yourself. Iron rusts! These so-called ""flavor pans"" do work ... for a time. Get used to replacing them at the wend of every grilling season. Don't use Oven Cleaner on them!"
5,"Hubby really likes Louis L""Amour books",My husband is a trucker & he really enjoys listening to audio books while driving. The driving time doesn't seem so long.
3,Sleazy Riders,"If I were to review the acting and filming of this movie, I would have to dig out a dictionary to find the negative words to describe them. Ed Wood couldn't have made a cheesier biker flick! HOWEVER, biker movies don't win Academy Awards. You watch biker flicks for the choppers, fighting, nasty bikers, nasty biker women, and half-naked nasty biker women. This has them all. The storyline is secondary to the primary reasons we watch these flicks. The basic plot is a white outlaw motorcycle gang and a black motorcycle gang are at odds and a gang war ensues. Its 90 minutes of corny R-rated biker action."
3,Hope you like pink,The sheets were made in Pakistan and are generously sized - but definitely have a pink cast.
1,AVOID!,"I was so hopeful on this one I bought 2 sets at once! Too bad for me. A gzillions threads came out almost immediately and the finishings melted down as a result, the material is hard and raw. Forget about NOT IRONING after a wash and dry if you don't want to leave half your cutis on the sheets!STRICTLY AVOID!"
4,What a deal!,"The sheets were nothing spectacular...but were decent 400 count sheets. At this price, they were out of this world."
2,Slow turn around on order,"Haven't recieved the sheet set yet but I am already disappointed with the order. I placed the order on a Friday morning hoping it might ship out that day since it says ""usually ship within 24 hours"". Product didn't actually ship till the next Thursday. Having family in town this weekend and no sheets for my new bed! Thanks for the slow processing. :("
4,A beautifully sung and energetically conducted performance.,This is a totally successful and utterly beautiful performance of an under-appreciated and virtually unknown bel canto opera. The composer's melodic inventiveness and sublime arias and ensemles are woderfully realized by the central interpreters and the star conductor. A must-have for all lovers of the Bel Canto period in general and of Bellini's music in particular.
3,"Good, but not excelent","I bought this because I like very much the Gruberova interpretations of Bel Canto Repertoire and I consider Balsa a great Mezzo. They don't disappoint here. Gruberova quite good and Balsa is a convincing Romeo.I'm always septic about Muti. His obsession about the ""come scrito"" interpretation can be quite boring. Gruberavova's great high notes are missing here.Sometimes during the interpretation it seems this is a studio record. This can be good and bad, good because of the sound quality and bad because we don't fill the public emotion (applauses only in the end of the acts)."
3,You'll be sorry!,"The careful translation of the original text into a more nicely-flowing English; the influence of the master historian, Chris Shores; the decision to publish by the renowned Grub Street Press: this should be a much better book than the volume detailing the naval fighter units of Japan by the same authors.But it's not.If you spend the better part of forty dollars hoping for a book that is more like Mr. Shores' ""Bloody Shambles"", Mr. Ford's ""Flying Tigers"", or even Mr. Bergerud's ""Fire in the Sky"", then you'll be sorry."
3,Engaging mystery but poor acting,"The plot of this movie is certainly interesting enough and has enough suspense and action to keep the viewer interested, however I was disappointed by the bad acting, especially from Doris Day. She is an excellent actress and has previously been extremely entertaining in other suspense trillers. But the character of Kit is clearly amateurish and melodramatic. I found the almost constant sobbing and wailing to be overdone and would have preferred Kit to be a stronger person. Despite this however, the movie is entertaining and has a surprise ending."
2,I must have seen a different movie,"After reading so many positive reviews of this movie, I can only assume that I didn't see the same movie that everyone else saw. Yes, it's a glossy, highly stylized film, but if it were any more obvious, it would be made of glass. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I adore Rex Harrison. I think Doris Day is guilty of some really poorly done histrionics. She's wrong for the movie, and the movie itself is terribly flawed."
4,Lightweight Thriller,"Even the most trusting viewer will likely put two and two together long before the film reaches its conclusion, but it scarcely matters in this super-slick Ross Hunter show about a Londoner's naive American wife who is threatened by a mysterious stalker. Day is at her most glamourously dressed; Harrison is equally suave; and every one over-acts with considerable pleasure. Rustle up some popcorn and curl up on the sofa!"

1,Not Toast... not even a cracker...,"This product isn't nearly as good as Toast, and barely better than the burning provided by the OS for free.If you want to do more than what the OS provides, spend the extra $50 for Toast."
5,Very detailed and concise book!,I truly love this book. It's small enough to take anywhere and it has all the information that one could need on the spot.
5,True story of a good cops life...,"Going against our current world of political correctness, this is one book that doesn't pull any punches and tells it like it is ... This is a true accounting of how a cop lives his life and tells of the personal sacrifices he makes to ""serve and protect"" those in his community... No Hollywood version here... Simply one highly-decorated officer's facts of what he and his brotherhood face everyday... From capturing drunk drivers, to helping the elderly, to nearly being beaten or shot to death - If you don't have respect for the police and the things they do now- You will after you read this book..."
3,Buyer Beware,"I bought Pinnacle Studio version 8 three years ago...then I upgraded to version 9...then I upgraded to version 10. With each purcha$e I hoped that Pinnacle was fixing all the bugs in their product. Apparently, they have just kept feeding the beast.Pros: When you create a finished product, you may have a wonderful DVD of little before seen family movies. You may succeed in creating a family treasure sure to make everyone cry with joy. Keep your movies short and simple and you will be happy (if you get the program to run). Another plus is the numerous free patches between major releases.The cons: You will need a serious PC to use this product. 1GB RAM required (even though the box says 512MB). A 2+ Ghz CPU will be needed. Creating the product is exhausting. It is slow to load. It is buggy. It crashes. Lots of features that you see require an additional purchase.Not for the faint hearted."
1,Stay Away,I have 10.5 plus have downloaded the patch to make it 10.6 and it still doesn't work properly. I have had nothing but problems with this software. I find it disturbing that I paid 100 plus dollars for this software and I've had nothing but problems with it. Capturing the video was no problem. Editing it was slow and it kept locking up or shutting down completely. after spending hours trying to get the video editied I finally was able to complete an abridged version of the video. I made a movie and now it keeps locking up. I'll burn the movie and put it in my DVD and it'll lock up somewhere along the way so I burn another one and it locks up somewhere else when playing. I have burned about 12 DVD's and not one has worked from beginning to end without problems. The tech support is useless. My advice is to stay away from this video editing software. I have bought a competitor's software and now will start the entire process over.
1,Buckle up.,"Because you will undoubtedly crash. Hard.If you like wasting time, acid stomach, and throwing money away, then go right ahead and pick this little baby up. But if you're trying to actually make videos with your computer, then avoid Pinnacle at all costs.Pinnacle Studio is appealing in its scope of features. This software would be a very decent product if it worked as advertised. But its inordinate amount of crashes have given the Pinnacle name a reputation it will likely suffer for years to come. The folks at Pinnacle have earned a reputation as producers of the world's most bug-laden video authoring software.There are at least five better alternatives, at equally affordable prices. Avoid Pinnacle at all costs."
1,Would rate it lower than 1 if I could.,"WORST... SOFTWARE... EVER! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME LIKE MYSELF AND SO MANY OTHER POOR SOULS DID! Read the reviews, cnet also. Go to the Pinnacle Support User Forum Site (pinnaclesys dot com) and read the countless people who can't get it to work.This software just doesn't work, end of story. You will be more upset about your time wasted than your money, buy anything but this. Render error, render error, render error... you will have nightmares about crashes and render errors, no wait, they are real. The only person who should buy this is the smart lawyer who is going to start the class action lawsuit against Pinnacle for selling us something that is not even beta quality, it is pure crapware, try to make anything longer than 20 minutes with transitions and it does not work, period."
1,Just don't even think about buying this. EVER.,"Pinnacle is known to have crappy products. All of the studio products are glitchy, and have countless bugs. just type in pinnacle studio 10.5 in google. You will see that almost every one who bought this piece of crap hates it. It made me so frustrated I bought a new computer, more ram, a video card. all useless in pinnacle. Get Adobe premiere elements 3, not this."
5,fascinating and useful...,"I really loved this book. It had two parts, basically.The first part was the story of Penny's kundalini awakening and the unravelling of her familiar routines as her psychic powers made it more difficult to handle day-to-day life. She worried that she was going psychotic. Thank goodness she chronicled this for us! She learned to respect her ""symptoms"" and now she shares this treasure of wisdom gained from her journey. The second part of the book she shares practical information we can use to navigate our lives with our own awakening consciousness. We can stay painfully rooted in old ways or we can evolve into a vaster, more compassionate and capable human. I wish I had the book with me to refer to, but I was so excited about it that I gave it to a friend to read. I will read anything and everything by Penny Kelly!"
1,The Evolving Human A True Story of Awakwned Kundalini,"Dont waste your money, this book is a boring, personal story of someone who thought they activated kundalini during a sexual experience. Gopi Krishnas books are much more interesting and explanatoryl."
3,My kids didn't care for this one...,"My kids LOVE Elmo's World and Sesame Street. The Elmo Saves Christmas was a little over my 2 & 3 year olds heads and the Christmas Eve on Sesame Street was an oldie that I remember as a kid, but my kids didn't care for it either. They did enjoy the Elmo's World Holiday DVD though..."
5,We love it!,"My 20-month old daughter, my husband and I all love this set. Three great Sesame Street dvds. Perfect addition to your Elmo or holiday collection."
4,It is what I expected,"Three Sesame street movies. No redundancy between the movies. One is a nice old school movie and the other two involve Elmo. One being an Elmo movie and one being a giant Holiday themed ""Elmo's world"". They did a good job of trying to make kids aware of other cultures and how they celebrate Christmas. For us, it was a nice alternative to our kids wanting to watch cartoons and it got them into the spirit of the holidays."
4,Very Happy!,"My daughter loved 2 out of the 3 DVD's, we watched Elmo Saved Christmas and Elmo's World Holiday over and over again but the 3rd DVD's was a bit out dated and she lost all interest in it. But over all I would buy this set again..."
5,My Daughter loved it!,"It came in about 5 days in a nice packaging. My daughter loved this, the only one she did not like was the last disc witch has no Elmo in it due to it being from a special before Elmo. Other than that she loves it so much she is about 16 months and just loves Elmo."
1,Got iLok? Software won't run without that little devil,"What EastWest will not tell you, and you have to look for on their site in small print, is the dongle called ""iLok"". They make you buy it for about $40, or your software wont work.I have not gotten around to actually review the software for quality - got the Silver version for Christmas.It just bugs me that they cannot tell you about the ""iLok"". Other software, like Cubase, include their dongle. So why can't EastWest manage that? Sad that they have to treat their customers like that.And what the other reviewer said about not being able to sell your songs if you like? That just sucks big time too. They all go too far with the copyright laws. What ever happened to the times, when you could just record your own music on your instrument and sell it?Shame on you, EastWest!"
3,All problems solved quickly,"This book is interesting for the details of early days of Florida. It is unrealistic in that all problems and conflicts are resolved in about three spoken sentences. Indians living deep in the swamps speak good English. People live in malarial Florida for years before getting the disease. Still, the story gallops along and the characters are interesting enough that you want to know what happens. If ""Cold Mountain"" is a 10, ""A Land Remembered"" is a 5."
3,A Good Overview of Florida History,"For the thousands of individuals who decide to re-locate to Florida each year, Patrick Smith's ""A Land Remembered"" should be must read. It provides a glimpse of Florida's past and shows a state dominated by cattle ranching and orange groves. For others who have lived here all their lives, the book is a reminder of just how hard life in Florida was for early settlers. While the characters may not be the most compelling in all of literature, they are a good technique to illustrate the developments that have shaped the Florida of today and make us aware of how relatively easy we have it."
4,Great Story,Not really a history of Florida - but a great story of the roots of an american family pre-civil war and continuing into the mid- 20th century. Fascinating saga of the true pioneer spirit -- worth reading.
5,Truly GREAT story,"I have never been much of a reader, but I had a hard time putting this book down for the night. It is an interesting story following the life of a pioneer family. The way it is written makes you feel like you are right there with them. I felt the hardships that they endured in the story. I am a Floridian but you don't have to be to enjoy this book about old Florida. The cities mentioned in the book really existed - I looked them up in an atlas."
5,Ryan D,"""A Land Remembered"" is a truly excellent book. Smith paints a picture of Florida that makes you feel like you are right there working the land with the whole MacIvey crew. Character development in the story is also great. A must read for anyone who is interested in Florida or historical fiction as a whole."
5,A Land Remembered,"A must read for anyone interested in Florida pioneer history. Thoroughly enjoyable and the kind of book that you can live in. A ""keeper"" to read over again several times and a worthwhile addition to any home library."
5,Florida's Version of War and Peace,"Digging beyond the surface of this historical fiction are numerous lessons about family values, societal ethics and morals illustrated by three generations of MacIveys."
5,A Land Remembered truly takes you back in time,"My husband and I have been enjoying the audio version of A Land Remembered, which we picked up - - luckily - - at our local library. It's the kind of story you just can't stop reading. My goodness! What those people went through. It truly makes me appreciate the quality of life we have today vs. yesterday but at the same time, you long to know what it must have been like back then - - A Land Remembered takes you there. We've laughed, we've cried and we've grown to love the MacIveys as if they were kinfolk. It has truly enriched our lives and given us a new appreciation for the settlers who came before us."
5,A Land Remt embered,This book was our book club selection and rated a 9.8 out of 10. It tells about the early settlement of Florida and the life-threatening challenges and that faced the settlers who tried to tame the land. It follows several generations of a family and ends with the third generatiion. Each character captures the reader with well-written and developed characters. The description of the trials and dangers leaves the reader spellbound and unable to put the book down. I loved it so well that I gave this book as Christmas presents.
5,A Land Remembered - Florida's novel,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It is a must read for anyone living in Florida. I would recommend it to anyone (male, female, young, old)."
5,very pleased,"Anybody who is interested in Florida history needs to read this book, it is very inform-able and interesting, one of those books a person doesn't want to put down, not just explaining how people lived and survived in the swamplands but it is written in story form with people and names and you feel like you are going through it too, very good book, I've read other books on Florida but this is the best!!"
2,Like watching an episode of Bonanza,"This book has been lauded up and down the State of Florida for its wonderful historical content. But when any tale is as badly imagined and poorly written as this one, isn't it also necessarily true that that we must question its historical accuracy as well? From the stereotyped Indians, speaking in their unbelievably clear, brief, measured syllables, to the aw shucks blacks, to the backwoods men themselves and the wise all-knowing cook/womenfolk they marry, there are no real people. It is as if Patrick Smith has peopled his land with a lot of little plastic action figures like the kind boys used to get in a bag. Even the countryside itself isn't well depicted. Land Remembered is like a western in reverse - how the West Was Lost. All Patrick Smith adds to formulaic western writing is a little cheap bitterness. Read Peter Matthiessen. Read The Little House on the Prairie books."
3,What a disappointment!,"Don't turn to this book for an easy way to learn Florida history. Sure, it's an easy read, but it only looks at 100 years in the lives of American pioneers in central Florida. Forget 300 years of Spanish settlements. Forget the Seminoles. As far as this book is concerned, they didn't exist.If you're black, you may also be offended as I was by the author's portrayal of the few black characters. The Indians were portrayed with dignity; the black characters were either servile or buffoons. Unfortunately, my white ""friends"" saw no problem with this.This book has been suggested in some Florida communities as one book everyone should read as a community project. I think ""A Land Remembered"" is a poor choice."
3,Criticism of A Land Remembered,The author did not fully develop the characters and it seemed like he killed them all off at once. He took like 40 chapters to go through two generations and then killed them all of in like two chapters.
1,SNORE.,"A Land Remebered might just qualify for one of the most boring books I've ever read. I was required to read it for my florida history class and lets just say i waited until the very last minute to read it for a reason.TOBIAS, FROG, BONZO, SKILLIT, ZECH... WHATS UP WITH THESE NAMES?- yeah this book was not only stupid and pointless but all of the characters were so unbelievably ignorant that it was hard to bring myself to turn the page.ZECH= MAN WHORE- tawanda or glenda???? the choice was obvious for me but of course by the end of the book i realized he picked glenda who was not my choice. =) what can i say i guess i have bad taste. but seriously lets get real, girls dont say stuff like.. ""its cold, put your arm around me""OVERALL- i have to read volume 2 next. i would rather shoot myself"
3,A Land Remembered,"This book was interesting from the standpoint of early Florida history. However, the characters were one-dimensional and not very well developed. I would recommend it only to someone with an interest in early Florida."
4,Great Book@,"I was told to read this book by my Grandfather. I actually got it, only because my Grandfather was with me at the time, and I had no intention of reading it. I am typically the stereotypical woman, and most of what I read is romance novels. Late one night, having read all my others books, I picked up A Land Remembered and began to read it. At the second chapter, I was still not too into it, but I keep reading. Pretty soon, I couldn't put the book down, I just wanted to know what was going to happen next. I am a native of Florida, and I found it so interesting to read about these places that I have been visting all my life. I had never thought about what Florida like back then. The book leaves you almost wishing that Florida would have remained as it once must have been. Or you are at least wishing you could have seen the state so wild and beautiful."
5,Best book I've ever read,This book was loaned to me by a friend. I am not an avide reader but I couldn't put this book down once I started. My husband was AMAZED I spent hours reading not knitting! Bought this book to give to a friend who had heard about it. I owed her for a favored she had done for me. She also loved this book.
5,A Land Remembered,"I never tire of reading this book, thrilled when I could get it on my kindle. I also have the printed copy which has been well read. My grandson is an avid reader so I gave him a printed copy to enjoy through the years. Well worth reading, more than once."
4,A Land Remembered,A most enjoyable read with an acceptable amount of Florida pioneer history blended in. Highly recommended to those who enjoy historical fiction.
2,Ehh.. Don't allow yourself to impulse-buy this.,"I originally bought these for my new espresso machine. They arrived packed loose, just wrapped in bubble wrap, so I guess they are just sitting on a shelf somewhere in a warehouse waiting to be purchased. One of them had a stain on the stainless steel part, and when I washed it it wouldn't come out. So I sent them back. Return was easy enough and my money was refunded promptly. Thanks for that, Amazon. I guess they just weren't what I was expecting.If you are charmed by the combination of stainless steel and porcelain like I was, take a closer look. When you are holding it in your hand it doesn't feel as nice as a solid-porcelain cup would have. The stainless steel base is hollow and it just looks and feels awkward. Be sure this is what you want, don't buy on a whim."
2,The Appalachian Trail,"It wasn't quite what I wanted for my son. A little ""raw"" More of experiences of others, instead of facts, for which I was looking."
4,Another great album,"What I like about David Usher is that, while his albums are never quite the same, he is consistent. This new one is a great follow up to Morning Orbit. It's reflective and poignent. My favourites would have to be ""I'm Coming Down"", ""In This Light"" and ""Message Home"". I agree with others, though, that you may not think much of the album after hearing it a first time, but it just keeps getting better and better with every listen. This is an artist that you must listen to the entire album to really appreciate it."
5,Heintje ist prima,"Heintje wird niemand enttauschen. Seine deutsche Lieder gefallen mir sehr. Wirklich ein Wunder, weil deutsch nicht seine Muttersprache war."
3,good but need phonetic translarions,"the book is great for people wjo can read Farsi but it would be better if it included Phoneyic translations. Also, for you children it would the pictures are a little absreacr. Photos would be better. The secrion on the body is hard for even an adult to figure out what they are trying to depict. The animal page is wonderful and with a lack of English-Harsi books available it is okay."
5,mesmerizing!,"Ellen Gilchrist is one of my favorite writers, Rhoda Manning is my favorite of her characters, and Net of Jewels is Ellen Gilchrist at her best. Rhoda Manning is her usual delightful, irresistable, impulsive self in this book. This captivating novel tells of her writing talent, her falling in love, marriage, children, and many painful and tragic events in between. I have read this book many times and endorse it wholeheartedly."
1,Disapointing Read!,"I really was disappointed by this book. I have read a lot of the titles off of Oprah's book list but this is by far the worst of them all. I find the main character so obnoxious and annoying that I spend majority of the time angry at her. I am unsure if Ms.Gilchrist expected us to feel sorry for Rhoda or if she wanted us to hate her. The story isn't funny, it isn't sad, it isn't anything except a waste of time. I typically enjoy stories that are set in the South because I find the whole atmosphere of the area of intoxicating but this did not do the South justice. I really enjoy poetry but the amount of poetry in this book is over the top. We are expected to believe that Rhoda is really brilliant but her personality does not fit her supposed intelligence. The book's jacket summary gives the idea of a fullfilling and warm novel but it is really lacking and cold. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,THE MOST ENTERTAINING SPY MOVIE OF THE SIXTIES,"The star here is the director of photography CHRISTOPHER CHALLIS who did a great job trowing everything from a fantasy sequence with PECK having a nightmare and enjoying a most dangerous bike ride in the steets to the pursuit of our heroes who must run for their lives while enjoying a horse ride.The star here is also SOPHIA LOREN wearing the clothes designed by CHRISTIAN DIOR.She is gorgeous in this movie which seems a perfect tribute to her beauty.Add the music of HENRY MANCINI, the beautifully designed opening titlesthat are of course reminiscent of JAMES BOND and you're in for good entertainment.The script which is the weakest aspect of the movie is fill with funny in jokes that makes up for the coherence of the whole.Originally, the film was 13 minutes longer.A message to the guys:would you have liked to be in GREGORY PECK's place during the shower scene ?"
3,Pas de deux with Sophia & Gregory.,I enjoyed this espionage thriller just for Sophia Loren alone. The woman does have star quality.Shes probably played every ethnic group escept celtic. I also liked the chemistry between the two co-stars.Both sadly retired from full time acting.What a shame they dont make movies any more. Everytime I hear that nursery rhyme 'goosey goosey gandar' I think of this film.I thought the plot was original and even I was stymied until the end.Its one of those 'you dont know who to trust movies' and worth watching.
4,Arabesque,"Arabesque is entertaining, however I would not consider it ""one of the best"". On a scale from 1 to 10 I would give it a 7. Having said that, I would say to those who like action and suspense, you probably would enjoy this movie, though I believe it falls short of being outstanding."
3,Primary Value of this DVD is Ms. Sophia Loren,"The plot to this movie is only so-so. I have seen Gregory Peck is some of his other movies. This movie is probably his weakest performance. His incessant wise-cracking in situations of danger wears a little thin, not to mention the blooper in the movie where his torn shirt changes arms several times.The saving grace to this purchase is that the DVD gives you the opportunity to look at the beautiful Sophia Loren. I never cease to be amazed at her beauty.I agree with a previous reviewer. If it were just the movie plot you are concerned with, I probably would not buy the DVD in the first place.If you are a Sophia Loren fan, you WILL buy it and you WILL watch it more than once."
5,They don't make them like this now!,A great and fun older film. It was such a pleasure to see a film that was pleasing to the senses! I had forgotten how enjoyable this oldie is! I'm so glad I bought it and it will be one of those that I will enjoy again and again.
3,An Okay Movie,I bought it just to see Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren. For that it was well worth it but the plot is just okay.
3,Dated thriller is worth a view.,"I bought this VHS movie because of the music composed by Henry Mancini. The storyline of this movie itself is OK. The director delights in using reflected images just about anywhere he can often in very clever ways. This is a bit distracting, but may go well with the underlying theme of the movie where the protagonist finds himself in a position were he does not know who to trust. It seems that everyone he is involved with does not show their true nature.The soundtrack is monophonic. To really hear the beauty of Henry Mancini's score one must seek out the Stereo soundtrack recording, a favorite of mine."
4,My dear favourate harmony!,I used to listen to this album(LP) more than 40 years ago and went to their dinner show in Japan about 30 years ago. I have got some albums but this is the best.
2,Should be much better,"First of all, this is a 10% Kona BLEND, it is not 100% Kona coffee!Second, it is a 7 oz. bag, which is less than 1/2 pound.For the price, you would do better to go direct to the Lion Coffee site. So much for rarity.As for flavor, it's not much better than cafeteria coffee. I found it lacking in aroma and flavor.Granted, the lion is a great looking brand, and it makes a cool souvenir to bring back to friends but, like the Macadamia nuts, it tastes much better in the islands. Save your money and buy a keychain instead. If you're looking for a nice Kona blend, keep looking."
5,Great gift!,"My kids (ages 5-10) loved this kit! It was very easy to do, and not too time consuming for a busy MOM! I think it could have used another mold, but besides that, I highly recommend!"
4,What a find,I had been looking for this item previously and never could get one. It was a great addition to the collection of toys we have that are Mustangs. Too bad we don't have the full version of this one...Oh well.
1,"Very, very odd","This book contains a (presumably) accurate historical review of post-Freudian depth psychology based on C. G. Jung's fascinating and provocative explorations into his own psyche, and others'. Regrettably, the book is almost utterly hagiographic: It contains little critical discernment and substitutes summary for scholarship. All in all, typical of the Jungian approach to historical enquiry: full of names, self-justifying, occasionally interesting, but more like cotton candy (vanishing upon consumption) than like true intellectual or psychological nourishment. A major disappointment."
2,I am surprised,"THis product was 20 $ two days ago. When I tried to order it online today, I found it the used version 35 $. How come?"
4,Lover Come Back,"There is nothing better than classic Doris Day and Rock Hudson, but throw in Tony Randall, and you can count on a winner. The threesome has appeared together before, but it never gets tiring. One thing that surprised me was that this movie was ahead of its time, as you don't find many classics that emphasize sexual relationships. A definite keeper - Many hilarious scenes that will make this movie enjoyable to watch over and over again."
2,Great Film - Mediocre DVD,"This is a great, classic comedy, but the DVD version suffers somewhat. It has a sallowy, yellowish tint to it (not horribly so, but noticebly so) and is VERY fuzzy. (And I'm not talking about the shots with the glamour filters.) It is great to have this on DVD finally, but compared to some other Universal budget DVDs, this looks like it was rushed very carelessly into production. The film deserved better. 5 Star Film / 2.5 star DVD."
4,"""He's the last guy I would have figured...""","Doris Day-Rock Hudson romcom Lover Come Back reworks aspects of Pillow Talk in a plot that sees them as rival advertising execs fighting over the account for a non-existent product in a surprisingly and engagingly smutty satire that goes out of its way to mock the void between the two stars screen images and reality. Rock Hudson seems heroically determined to invite rumors by pretending to be unsure of his sexuality (""Just because you can light a stove doesn't mean you can cook"") and even creeping back into his apartment wearing nothing more than a woman's fur coat (""He's the last guy I would have figured..."" notes one onlooker) while a somewhat sidelined Doris Day gets married as she's rushed into the delivery room. Along the way Tony Randall practically invents both of the Crane brothers and sets up about three seasons worth of plots for Frasier as his neurotic boss. Great fun."
3,"Boy, have things changed!","I found this video in the stores recently. Now, mind you, I have already seen this movie when it was in the theaters. Then it seemed like a light hearted romp. By today's standards, it is virtually archaic in the acting and the script. Still, it is DEFINITELY a PG film."
1,Shocking,"I was shocked at how explicitly vulgar this movie was, considering the era it was made. I didn't see that there was anything romantic about it; there would have been if someone had rewritten the script and left out the fifty-something crude jokes along with the shot of Doris Day jumping out of Rock Hudson's bed with bare legs. It wasn't tasteful at all, much more like a modern movie, and if I want to see unromantic vulgarity, I'll go to the theater and watch ""Love Actually"". The very reason why I watch old movies is to escape the crudeness this movie promotes!I enjoyed ""Send Me No Flowers"" and ""Pillow Talk"" very much, but this one was off the edge. I wouldn't waste my money on it."
5,Best Day & Hudson Movie,This is my favorite film with both Rock Hudson and Doris Day! They light up the screen in this hilarious story of mistaken identity.
4,Classic Doris Day up-beat amusement.,"""Lover Come Back"" follows in the footsteps of ""Pillow Talk,"" and uses a similar plot-line. This movie is very enjoyable and contains some classic scenes and lines. Wonderful for Doris Day/Rock Hudson fans, or simply for its comedic value."
2,Poor Quality DVD,"I enjoyed the movie, I would give it 4 stars. This review is about the quality of the DVD. I have had the movie on VHS for several years. The picture quality is better on the VHS than it is on DVD. The picture is so grainy I don't enjoy watching it. I'll probably never watch the DVD. Universal should have done a much better job of transferring this movie to DVD. I'm very disappointed!"
1,Wrong product,"While I have no real problem with the edition I was sent, it was not what I ordered. I thought I ordered the pictured edition, used, but when I received it, found the Cambridge Edition--a fine edition, but not what I needed for my particular purposes. Oh, well. The notes will come in handy sometime, I'm sure."
2,I was not impressed,"I bought this book because I thought it would give me a more indepth look into this remarkable man's life. Instead, I found myself severly dissapointed. The book does give a good overview of the world around St. Assisi, but really didn't give me any new insight into the facts surrounding the man. Not only that, the author seems to be delving into an almost Jungian religious view. I would not have minded a Catholic view (because St. Assisi was obviously Catholic)or a secular view, but I found the author's choice of religious viewpoint to be completely without rational or support."
5,The REAL Revolution,"A work at last that captures brilliantly both the human and the spiritual in Francis of Assisi. In the chapter on Clare alone, for example, House throws great light on and debunks completely the relationship between the two as romantic or physical. It may have begun that way for Clare--she was, after all, only seventeen when they met, House tells us--but she quickly intuited the transcendent, divine nature of it (hence, the essence of her greatness)and went on to found the Poor Clares as we know them today. Placing Francis squarely in the confusing, violent, and hedonistic tendencies of his time, House does not shy away from pointing out the incredible strength, courage and overwhelming devotion to God that it took for Francis to resist and undo all that to become the world's greatest saint. Is his not the REAL revolution we are all looking for today in the confusing, violent, and hedonistic times we live in?"
5,What a read...,"I purchased this book just to support JoBlo.com. Not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was down right shocked. This is a fantastic and entertaining collection of movie reviews. JoBlo abandons the asinine critical stigma that states ""If a movie is popular or succesfull, then it cannot be good."" His reviews are funny, informative, and unique. He attacks them from an everyman perspective. As much as I love very intellectual dissections of films, I also love his approach. The inclusion of absolute classics from the likes of the Coen Brother's (""The Big Lebowski"") and John Woo (""Face/Off"") side by side is massively refreshing. I personally become frustrated when reading a positive review of a movie I loathe, but his reviews are never heavy handed. He always states ""I personally think this because..."", instead of assuming that there is a right or wrong answer in film criticism. I definately recomend this to any fan of film. Kevin Smith's (""Clerks"" ""Dogma"") foreword is also a hoot."
3,surprisingly upbeat,Suite A for flute was wonderful. What's a Telemann album without a trumpet concerto - that was brilliant also. Entire CD was well done!
4,Dick Francis? Brilliant as always!,"As a long-time devoted fan of the complicated Dick Francis books, I was hesitant to try a TV version of the stories, wondering how any of his stories could be condensed into an hour. I need not have worried, the stories are up to standard and the Halley character with his ""bionic hand"" is well done and believable.Well worth the purchase!"
3,Not as good as the novels,"Fairly well done adaption of the novels. Production values only fair, but a gritty portrayal. Worth watching if you are a Dick Francis fan."
4,Good bathroom accessory for handicapped,"This item works well for my father who needs the steadiness and supportive handles plus raised seat when he visits outside of assisted living. He would like the seat to be higher, but the handles give him something to brace himself with when sitting and rising. It is sturdy and stable, easy to remove from the toilet. I also appreciate that there is no gap between it and the toilet itself. Some toilet seats allow urine to get out between the seat and toilet base. It also will fit both round and oval toilets."
4,"Elevated toilet seat, does what it is supposed to do.",Bought this for my 91-1/2-year-old mother. She has trouble with her hip and needed a taller commode. This works great as she also has the handles for support rising and sitting. Works for the purpose it was intended quite well.
2,Extra Wide description false,"I'm a 62 year old male, 6' tall, weighing 250lbs. Just had my right hip replaced and am swollen. I purchased this seat based on the ""Extra-Wide"" in the product name. In reality it is not any wider than a seat I already had w/o support legs, that cost half as much. I can not sit comfortably on the seat. my hips press against the arms on both sides, and since my stitches are there, it's painful. Also due to tight space, I'm unable to get another body part down between my legs. Construction and ease of assembly are good, size is my complaint."
5,Extremely Useful,"Used during recovery after hip replacement. Seat is sturdy and stable because the legs go all the way to the floor, and it was very easy to assemble. It took five minutes, with no tools. Its very easy to install, and I never felt afraid of falling."
2,Strong but not a heavyweight,We paid the premium for the steel frame because we are big 300+ lb folks. Well it is plenty strong. Problem is that the arms are to close together. After we squeeze onto the seat there is no way to wipe! We had much better luck with an armless model and installing a safety bar out in front.
1,Bad product,This toilet was extremely low and could never hold 400 lbs... My boss almost got stuck on the toilet with this seat... Very dangerous... I need to return this product ASAP and would appreciate any information on how to do this... Again the legs were cheap and couldn't hold weight and the height on this chair was ridiculously low...Thank YouGina Crespo
2,give me a break........,"First of all, did Whitney Houston really have 36 hits? I only seem to remember about 14. This really should have been a single CD, but she had to make the same mistake George Michael made by trying to fill 2 discs with ""almost hits"". Funny thing is they both put the ""love songs"" on disc 1, and the ""dance songs"" on disc 2. Even funnier, George is on this CD. Anyway. The other mistake Whitney (or somebody) made was remixing half this collection. Was she that embarrassed with some of her stuff, or did she just forget that people buy ""hits"" collections to hear the songs the way they're used to hearing them. Put out a remix album if you want to chop them up that bad. On a positive note, half these tracks are the originals, they do sound good, and this is the only way to get everything in the same place."
4,Ignore the Personal Problems,"Love her or hate her, Whitney Hoston has one of the most phenomenal voices in pop music. The fact that her four full-length CDs produced so many hit songs only proves the dedication she has to her craft. While ""artists"" like Pariah Scary issue new CDs nearly every year with only one or two ""worthwhile"" nearly-identical singles, a Whitney disk is always a package deal.I was also heartened to see that a second disk with remixes was included in the set. Anyone in the industry will tell you that if it were not for the club remixes of her songs on her most recent album--""My Love is Your Love""-- it would not have had the same staying power & impact on the charts.Whitney is a true diva. This disk is long over due!"
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"For years I've been anxiously awaiting her greatest-hits CD only to be let down with this garbage.As you may well know, it's a two CD set. The first one is good. It has her memoriable ballards. It's the second one that is totally off the wall (the ""THROW DOWN"" CD). It features her famous fast-pace hits. But instead of the original arrangements, most are rediculous remixes.As far as I know, no one asked Whitney and those other fools to mess with the original cuts. People will buy this double CD set for the great song they remember . . . THAT'S WHY THEY WOULD GO OUT AND BUY A ""GREATEST HIT"", ""BEST OF"" OR AN ""ANTHOLOGY"" CD!The remix of the song ""I WANNA DANCE WITH SOMEBODY (WHO LOVES ME)"" was so trashy that I didn't even want to hear it all the way through. What she and her cohorts did was a disrespect.If you're a real Houston fan you'd have the good sense to stay away from this one, but then you probably have all her albums anyway.Charles"
4,Cool Down and Throw Down!,"I bought this 2-CD release when it came about in 2000 because Whitney's one of the 80's artists I grew up listening to. I enjoyed it very well! It has ALL THE HITS BY THE GREATEST VOICE OF ALL TIME!!! If you are a collector or a superfan of hers, please don't let this one pass you by. This diva's voice is creamy and passionate and classy and all 32 flavors!!! The only disappointment I felt was that her dance hits did not come in their original form, they were remixed and I did not feel good when the remix version of ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)"" came on because the techno beat erased Whitney's feel-good laugh in that song. Plus, this greatest hits package did not contain her ""Miracle"", a song that makes me nostalgic for the good ol' days.BUT!!!! Don't let that discourage you from adding WHITNEY HOUSTON to your CD collection. Bonus tracks: ""One Moment In Time"" and ""The Star Spangled Banner."" Enjoy..."
3,A Good Collection. . .some remixes could have been left off,"All in all, this was a good collection. Listening to Disc 1 was like going down memory lane. From ""You Give Good Love"" to ""Could I Have This Kiss Forever"", Whitney still shines vocally. However, Disc 2 left a few things to be desired. Some of the remixes could have been left off, for example ""I Will Always Love You"", ""How Will I Know"", and ""Heartbreak Hotel"" should not have been remixed. I did however like the remix for ""I'm Every Woman"", ""Queen of the Night"" and ""Step by Step"". I do recommend buying this collection."
4,incredible voice,Tragic death. She has a beautiful voice. Too bad it takes a tragedy for myself and others to remember her and her voice.
4,Loved Disc 1,"Ordered the weekend she passed and was looking forward to all her hits being on this 2 CD set. However, the Throwdown disc (2) was good but not great - all the songs were jazzed up with synthesizers, etc. and I was disappointed in it. However, the first disc was so great with all of her soulful songs that I really didn't care and just enjoyed her lovely voice. She was an unbelievable talent and so sad she is gone so young."
3,mislead,I love this CD only because I love Whitney Houston. What I don't like about it is all my favor songs are on the second CD and the whole CD is remix. Was very disappointed :-(
1,FALSE ADVERTISING at its WORST,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD! This CD is the worst excuse for a Greatest Hits I have ever had the misfortune of buying. I feel ripped off! I wanted to give it NO STARS or NEGATIVE STARS, but this system won't let you. It is truly that bad! Whitney Houston is THE greatest vocalist of our time, but this is NOT original music as you are led to believe by the title ""Greatest Hits"". It is AWFUL/PAINFUL remakes of techno-disco with synthesizers and Whitney in a can sounding mixes that destroy her songs. It is a disgrace to her name and her music."
2,What were they thinking?,"Me like a lot of other people were eagerly anticipating a greatest hits package from Whitney Houston. While a lot of the hits are here, there are things missing like the original version of ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"", ""Miracle"", and ""Love Will Save The Day"". Another song I hoped would show up on this compilation was ""Moment Of Truth"" which was released only as the B-Side of ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"" which is also not here in it's original version. The remixes on disc two is what really ruins this package, I would have preferred some of the original 12"" mixes of the earlier cuts over the weak house mixes included here. What seemed like a good idea, putting ballads on one disc, and uptempo cuts on the other, much like the George Michael greatest hits package, the Whitney set leaves a lot to be desired. Only for the extremely hardcore fan. Fans of the original versions, wait for the remastered CD's of her catalog albums."
1,"I wish there was a choice for ""0"" stars","What a disappointment. This cuts from the disks, particularly the second have lost their melody and are nothing more than a cacophonous blasting of sound. The rhythm, beat, and style of the originals are lost. I found the album to be a total waste of money and an insult to her fans.Stop before you buy. It certainly is not worth it."
1,This is not the Whitney CD you want.,"I don't know whose idea it was, but the second CD in this collection is a travesty. Every song on the second CD, save the Star Spangled Banner, is thoroughly trashed as a dance ""remix."" Now, I've heard remixed songs in the past that I've liked, particularly if they've hewn close to the soul of the song or retained the hooks that made it good in the first place. But every one of these remixes is bombastic and most of them bury Whitney's voice somewhere under all the bad electronica. If you want any of the songs listed on the second CD, just get the CD they were originally on. This package is a waste of your money. It's too bad, too. The first CD gets it right, but the second one gets it so wrong, the package is simply ruined. I'm selling this one back to a used dealer as soon as I can."
3,whitney has finally passed,we all saw this coming long ago well anyway whit has left a huge legacy of music for her fans to enjoy. she will be missed I was'nt a fan of copurse but some things has to be done accordingly looks like jubilee is gonna take out some more this year the stars are falling and whit's aT PEACE WITH whatever it was she worshipped.
1,"I am highly disappointed, first delay of my CD and on returning item, No response as well as No money back from Seller","I received CD very very late (After 2 and half months) and on returning it back to HNE. They are not refunding my money on repeated request. Amazon must black list this seller.** I did not open the CD and returned as it is.Hi Atul,Thanks for letting us know.Your order was dispatched on May 12th.As per our Comments for this item, we ask that you please allow approximately 14 days for delivery, as the item is shipping from Australia.Hopefully you will receive the order by the end of the week or early next week.RegardsAlan - HNE"
1,The worst possible cd,This cd is the same as william hung. It deserves a throw in the garbage can just like her singer. This album has bad words and whitney lost her voice completly. This is completly not worth the money
2,Whitney Houston is one bad*** lady,"This review gets 2 stars because Whitney Houston performed all of the songs.This review does not get 5 stars because Amazon has decided to hike the price of this album immediately following her untimely death.I'm not sure if this a decision made by Amazon or Sony, but it's disgusting. Have some decency! This woman was alive 3 days ago, and you're already profiteering from her death?"
5,Whitney: The Voice of an Angel,"For over the past 15 years, Whitney Houston has been the the female singer to set the standard and criteria by which we judge R&B, pop, AND the meaning of the word ""diva."" All of her hits are here as well as 2 ""previously unreleased songs"" featuring Deborah Cox and Enrique Iglesias, her dazzling Star Spangled Banner rendition (which she performed live at Super Bowl XXV on 01.27.1991), and 14 HOT remixes. This compilation is for every music lover...EVEN if you are not a BIG fan of Whitney Houston. This music icon has done it all. She ranks up there with the all-time greats...Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, etc."
2,LOOKING FOR TRUE DANCE REMIXES? NOT HERE!,I couldn't believe the track listing for the second disc when I read it-it's supposed to be a disc of dance mixes. CD's hold a maximum of less than 80 minutes of music-there are 18 tracks on disc two-that means severely edited dance mixes of about four minutes each. And some of them are real turkeys. Those tracks could have been omitted to make room for real dance mixes.
5,Favorite songs,All of Whitney's songs are a hit. A beautiful person who's name and music will live on forever. I love her music.
2,Save Your Money,Bought this for my girlfriend who was a major Whitney fan. Not the best collection out there. Remixes will probably disappoint you.
1,European Version VS USA Version,"I have bought both versions of this album, and I must say that European version is much better than this USA version. Usually I like remixes very much, but I don't like Whitney's earlier remixes at all... they sound so old.And because Arista calls this ""GREATEST HITS"", I think it should include the greatest hits... but the USA version should be called ""GREATEST BALLADS & REMIXES"".I love the European version because it includes all those fantastic original versions, but there is also another reason why I like that version more. USA version is messed up, Cool Down CD includes midtempo R&B tracks (MLIYL, HH) and Throw Down CD includes ballads (OMIT, SSB)... The European version is also much better in this case, Cool Down CD includes only ballads, and Throw Down CD includes only faster R&B tracks and dance songs.USA VERSION : 1 STAR EUROPEAN VERSION : 5 STARS"
5,Whitney Lives on!,Great collection from a music legend. These are the best of the best- it doesn't get any better than this collection!
1,Not what I expected,"These are all dance re-mixes of the original songs. I was looking for the same version as on the original release vinyl before this ""Greatest Hits"" came out. YUCK"
4,omit remixes,"I enjoy listening to the COOL DOWN CD, but the THROW DOWN CD is terrible. I prefer the uptempo songs in the original form. The remixes are terrible."
3,"Too many songs missing, too many redundant remixes","I love Whitney Houston and do not regret buying this CD however, I was jipped. What happened to many of the singles from the ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"" album? Furthermore, it would have been nice to hear the original versions of her hits opposed to the remixes that all sound the same. Whitney, I'm hurt. Why do you continue to let your fans down?"
3,The Queen Herself,"I purchased and listened to Whitney's Greatest Hits CD and must say I think it is a nice project. I love to hear her sing. Disc one took me to a place I haven't been a long time. I like the way she compiled all of her ballads onto the first disc. A few of my favorite and new songs that I don't already have in my ""Whitney"" collection are included on that cd, which made it an even greater disc. Now disc two, I totally got turned off with all of the beats and mixes to songs that to me were made to be ballads. The only noticeable changes to the songs are the beats which sounded like a lot of noice over top of a beautiful voice. Because of disc two, I returned the cd to the store where I purchased it. I would recommend the compilation to someone who doesn't already have her music in their collection but will note that disc two, in my opinion, is only good for aerobic classes."
3,OK,was OK but I hate it when they change the music to the same beet they give other songs to make it dance music
2,Should be Called 'The Remixes' not 'Greatest Hits',I bought this cd many years ago and just now feel the urge to write a review. I was so disappointed. I mean the original versions of these songs are good but after listened to half a disc I felt remixed out. The remixes become boring and just left me thirsty for the original versions. Also did not like the way the songs were broken out. One disc is supposed to be mellow and the other is supposed to be jamming but after listening to the disc I wondered why songs appeared on the wrong disc. There is no flow on these cds. I am still waiting for the proper greatest hits while this one gathers dust. Not recommended.
2,Whitney Houston - Greatest Hits,"Not as great as I had hoped. Too much of her later stuff, which is when she got worse."
1,Buy the UK version,"The UK version also has crap, but much less than the US version. I'd suggest you buy the UK, then create your own custom CD on your PC. All of the good stuff neatly fits on 1 CD. Imagine that, just 1 CD."
5,"Whitney's Entry in ""Declaration of Independence"" Songbook","TOP TEN ""Declaration of Independence"" Tracks...in no particular Order.1. I'm Outta Love - Anastacia2. Mr. Lonely - Deborah Cox3. Sacrificial Lamb - Amber (Found on her Brand New ""My Kind of World"" CD, this track is the latest and one of the Best additions to the ""Declaration of Independence"" Songbook (www.Amber-MCC.com) Amber's previous #1s includes ""Sexual"", ""If You Could Read My Mind"" and ""This is Your Night"")4. It's Not Right, But It's OK - Whitney Houston5. Strong Enough - CHER6. No More Tears (Enough is Enough) - Donna Summer7. I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor8. You Make Me Sick - Pink9. Survivor - Destiny's Child10. Hit the Freeway - Toni Braxton"
3,"Its not right, but its OK","Whittney Houston has always been for me an artist that I could listen to on the radio but would never actually buy any of her albums. When this greatest hits came out,I thoght why not. Well its good, disk one being filled with her love songs and disk two with her dance numbers. I would have preferred less remixing and more of the original songs but I guess she was aiming for the younger crowd. Not that I'm over the hill or anything but growing up in the 80""s I was more familiar with the originals. Overall a nice collection best song for me is ""Could I have this Kiss forever"" buy it for old time's sake. It will bring back memories of the 80's."
2,Disappointing,"I love Whitney Houston's music. It's envigourating, strong and powerful. Therefore, I couldn't believe my ears when I was listening to the second CD of this album. How disappointing! All house-remixes! Nevertheless, the first CD is very good."
3,sorry,"I think Arista records wants to get all of Whitney's music heard because this is no greatest hits cd, this is a cd with little known Whitney songs."
2,Forgettable tribute to a great diva!,"Whitney's 'Greatest Hits' CD set is nice, but it didn't blow me away completely.I picked it up only for the 'new' tracks, and most of the remixes are annoying.These remixes destroy the original songs, which should have been collected for this set.After dubbing the new tracks, I will sell this to someone or auction it off.I can make a better Whitney Houston 'retrospective' than Arista, and I will probably do so within 2 weeks!THE FINAL VERDICT: 2 CD Set is Over Produced, Over Blown, and has Unnecessary Fluff that results in a forgettable tribute to one of the greatest voices in music history!Real Whitney Lovers should PASS on this!"
4,A VERY GOOD GREATEST HITS ALBUM,"THIS ALBUM SHOULD WIN A GRAMMY BECAUSE IF ITS DIFFRENT SOUNDS AND ARTIST. I LOVE THIS ALBUM. ESPECIALLY THE REMIXES LIKE "" I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU "" AND MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE"
4,It's good!!,"I always love Whitney Houston music. I like the greatest hits Cd 1. I also like the remixes cd. But I do not think they should have remix ""I Am Your Baby Tonight"". It is good song by itself, they should have never touch it. My favorite song is ""Could Have This Kiss Fovever"" with Enrique Ingensis and ""Same Script, Different Cast"". It kind of reminds me of Brandy and Monica the boy is mine."
2,T-Que,I was excited ... until the CD arrived! Disc 1 (Cool Down) was great. Disc 2 (Throw Down) was of very poor quality. Several of the songs were so poorly done they wouldn't play (they sound like poor copies of the original on Disc 2).
4,So many remixes.... I love it still.,"I love Whitney Houston. When she passed away, my mom was depressed so I ordered this CD for her. She loved it. But I really like the Cool Down & Throw Down part. I wish that the Throw Down didn't have remixes, I only wish it had her up-tempo songs instead (like ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"",""How Will I Know"",etc) But other than that it's an incredible CD."
2,Dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed in the CD. As one her fans who have followed Whitney's career from the beginning, I was not interested in buying the dance versions of all of her hits. My idea of a greatest hits album is one that has all of your favorites on one CD. This isn't it."
2,Great ballads......Awful remixes,"I'm sorry, but you just don't leave four number one hits - ""So Emotional"", ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"", ""Dance With Somebody"", and ""How Will I Know"" - off a CD and call it a greatest hits collection. This is false advertising. Especially insulting is the fact that these four missing songs can only be found on three separate CD's, meaning it you want to assemble a REAL Whitney Houston greatest hits collection you better be prepared to fork over a lot of money. The remixes on disc two are terrible; they all sound the same. And aren't we supposed to ""cool down"" AFTER we ""throw down""? - the discs are in the wrong order! To conclude, if you love just her ballads you'll love this CD, but if you're like me and like ALL of Whitney Houston's hits this is a real disappointment."
2,DUMB REMIXES RUIN GREATEST HITS ALBUM,This would have actually been a pretty good greatest hits album if it weren't for those mind-numbing remixes. And that cutesy cover of Ms. Houston drilling her platinum awards is kinda boring. Stick with the albums or burn your own personal compilation instead.
1,I will always (glub glub glub) you!,"Poor old Whitney started off with a fair amount of talent but then turned bad. Most of the songs she sang stank. If you want to hear them, you can hear them here but I don't think you'll want to hear them much. The worst is ""I Will Always Love You."" Rebecca Black said many of the same things in her masterpiece ""Friday,"" which you can buy for a whole lot less that this album of stinkeroos."
2,Clearly NOT a Greatest Hits CD Package,"The first CD in the package is a ""Greatest Hits"" CD. The second CD in the package was nothing but unheard hip hop stuff and a couple of her hits with the hip hop rythm added to it.Wished I hadn't bought the CD and spent extra money on it."
2,2 Different Collections?,"Whoa! What on earth is going on? I own all of Whitney's previous albums, and so was looking forward to the remixes on the Greatest hits. But, to my surprise, there seems to be one 'Greatest Hits' collection for the US, and a completely different one for the rest of the world. I have read several other reviews where people have expressed disappointment or disgust with the second CD that is full of remixes; my gripe is exactly the opposite: already owning most of the material on CD2, I actually do want the remixes! So, not living in the US, how do I get these? I would like to give a single finger salute to the genius at Arista who devised the idea of having two very different 'greatest hits' collections for Whitney - there is actually sufficient material for a real double-CD Greatest Hits album and also a separate remix CD. This would have kept everybody happy. Well done, bozo's. All I can say is, thank God for mp3's!"
3,For a rather overproduced singer it's ok,"There is a sense of detatchment to the feeling of this compilation, which reminds one that Whitney Houston is perhaps the archetypal singer that is generated and created by big industry moguls. There is a few recent cuts that are more honest than her early hits, but this set reminds me why I am not a fan myself.This singer has the pipes, but lacks feeling."
2,Techno Dancehall Disc 2 Ruins The Whole Thing!,"I wanted to hear all the original mixes of the songs that I remember hearing on the radio in the 1980's. Unfortunately, many of those songs I recall fondly have been remixed to sound like dancehall numbers, like you might find at a gay nightclub. The techno transformation of the mid '80s to early '90s popular R&B hits does not turn out well. All the wonderful Whitney Houston songs of that period are given the same embellishments and treatment on the second disc. Whitney's amazing voice is overwhelmed by these techno musings, and I'm looking forward to a future ""greatest hits"" collection that simply remasters the old songs of Whitney Houston that I loved so much growing up. The selection of songs is great on this 2-disc set. It's the remixes on the second disc that ruin the whole thing."
1,Awful production,"This was produced in England, I believe, and perhaps their standards are different there. In many of the selections, the instrumentation all but drowns out the vocals. And the rendition of ""I Will Always Love You"" is totally different from the ""Bodyguard"" version, and to me it was a terrible disappointment. Most of the songs are more ""noise"" than the joyful and melodious voice that was what made Whitney Houston the beloved singer she was. The best numbers on the 2-CD album are the ""bonus numbers"" on CD 2, one of which is her National Anthem. A better choice for Whitney-lovers, I think, is the ""Ultimate Collection"" produced by Aristo Europ, in December 2007. Almost all of her truly greatest hits, remastered and truly spectacular, are there."
1,Came defective,"I was so looking forward to receiving this album, but song seven on the first album was blank. Nothing there. Can you send me another copy? Thank you"
5,The Greatest Voice Of All,"The long awaited,long anticipated greatest hits collection from the number one diva of all time is worth every penny..it's got it all..the ballads and the great remixes of this womans tremendous 15 year career..plus some rare tracks added on for good measure. The new songs stand great on their own as well..this is the collection any Whitney fan could ask for and more..She is without a doubt the Greatest Voice of All ! Buy it and enjoy !"
4,Great Stuff -- Love the Remixes,"Hearing Whitney singing her 80's ballads, I didn't like them as much as I used to (I guess times and styles change). I much preferred the more recent music and awesome remixes on the second disc. She also offers up a few new songs, two of which are amazing -- 'Same Script, Different Cast' and 'Could I Have This Kiss Forever?'Overall, this is well worth getting. There are songs for when you want to relax and others for when you want to get up and dance."
2,Whitney can do Better!,CD #1 is great because it has all of her songs when she used to have that powerful voice. CD #2 reminds me of the music that has you dancing in the GAP. It's all of her songs with a Latin/House music beat. And my favorite songs are either remixed or has a different beat.
3,"Great songs, most were better before ""remixed""",I love all of the songs on the greatest hit album but some of the best ones were remixed into club versions. I prefer the original better and wish my money had bought the originals.
2,not complete,This is missing a song. Where is Count on me? One of her best songs and she has a co writing credit on it.
5,Whitney's Greatest Hits,Excellent CD!!! Love her songs!!!Enjoyed the CD very much!!! Whitney's songs are a treasure to have..A wonderful talent gone way too soon!!!
3,the MUSIC is still going STRONG even if the ARTIST isn't,"YOU FIRST HEARD HER IN 1985.AND LOVED THE MISIC!NOW IT IS 2005 TWENTY YEARS LATER AND STILL LOVE THE MUSIC!YOU LOVED THE SONG'S TO THE SOUNDTRACKS OF HER MOVIE'S!And million's of people have great memories to these song's.And the memories will never fade as long as the music plays.The only problem is people don't have memories to the remix song's.It seem's kind of strange to turn a love song into a dance song.what she shoud have done is what. MARIAH CAREY did make a 2-disk regular greatest hit's.and a 2-disk remix version.But the fact remains is that she has a pile of number 1 hits.And that alone will make her music be played on radio until the end if time. [A FAN OF R&B; AND HIP-HOP]/SYRACUSE,NEWYORK/"
3,"1st disc - great, 2nd disc - forget it","I give the first disc 5 stars - all her great ballads, which is what she is truly famous for. I give the second disc 2 stars - the new material is nice, some of the mixes are nice, but ultimately a waste of time. The second disc should have been a remix album released seperately from this package. Instead the second disc should have been the original versions of these uptempo songs. Why buy a Greatest Hits album to get remixes? We want the originals, not other versions of the songs. Arista should have supplimented a remix album for the techno heads, but otherwise, the second disc gets little to no airplay in my stereo. The first disc is fabulous, all her big ballads, some great new songs. If the second disc was her normal uptempo hits, this would be a flawless collection. Instead, it's incredibly unbalanced. Listen to disc one, forget about disc two."
2,STUPID REMIXES!,"When I buy a greatest hits collection, I want to hear the *radio* versions. This is what I heard growing up in high school. Studying in college. And driving to work every morning. I heard Whitney singing the *radio* versions of her hits, and the radio versions are what put Whitney consistently in the Top 5 Billboard chart. INSTEAD, we are given stupid, boring, soulless remixes. CD#1 (slow ballads):5/5 CD#2 (remixes): 0/5. I'm *extremely* disappointed. :-("
2,whitney houston - the greatest hits,"The CD is just ok. There are 3 or 4 songs in total that are good and recognizable, the others are ho hum. Would not buy again."
2,LAME Remixes of the original tracks!!!,"Don't buy this album for Whitney's upbeat stuff. All of her ballads are preserved in their original form, but the ""top DJs of the day"" do a number on her classic dance tracks. Take for instance, ""So Emotional"". If you are looking for the great upbeat musical track, you won't find that her. Its Whitneys' vocals spliced over a depressing rave-style club beat. Its murderous in my opinion. I have much respect for Jellybean Benitez and wouldn't mind hearing his club take on Whitney in a club, but not on a Greatest Hits package."
1,Who remixed whitneys greatest hits,I am a huge Whitney Houston fan. I was so excited to find and order this cd.. when it came I ripped it open.. jumped in the car... let the top down ... just to find all of my favorite songs remixed with workout music... Its awful I hate it!!!.. who mixes slow songs with disco music... I guess on a good note I can now exercise to whitney which Ive never thought of...:)
3,The Greatest of My Time,"The first CD was the best! The second CD was not that great! It had remixes with people I had not heard of! There were only about 3 songs worth listening too! But, Whitney is still one of the ""Greatest Singers of All Time!"""
5,Only The Best!,"If you love Whitney Houston, you HAVE to get this collection! All of our favorites are here:""The Greatest Love of All"", ""I Will Always Love You"", ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody"".... On & on... When she sang ""One Moment In Time"" for Sammy Davis, Jr's birthday celebration, not long before he died, I cried my eyes out! And it's HERE! She shared our lives. All our memories are on this cd!"
1,I hate it!,"Bought thiis CD and did not realize that it was a remix cd. After downloading it I heard those disgusting background music, I would not recommend this to no one. Very disappointed and would not recommend. VERY UPSET!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Perfect Hits ALBUM!,"I would have given this album 5 stars but the remixes got kinda annoying. I really wanted the original songs on the throw down disk. Songs like ""Greatest love of all"" and ""You give good love"" are terrific early hits. Also songs featured from her hit movies The bodyguard ""I will always love you"", ""Run to you"", and ""I have nothing"" are all truley great. ""I believe in you and me"" shines out wonderfully. ""Exhale(shoop shoop)"" is a true slow beat song. But ""One moment in time"" truley stands out the best making it one of my favorite Whitney songs of all time. The message in it is wonderful."
3,I say buy the individual albums instead,"If you're a huge pop music fan, then go ahead and buy this album. It does have all of her hits, and it will ring nostalgic for anyone who sang Greatest Love of All off-key at the top of their lungs growing up. But when I listened to this album all together, it was just too much Whitney for me to take. Particularly the second CD. I love Whitney's ballads, and listened to my mother's Whitney albums growing up, so I think I will buy her earlier CDs instead of this compilation album."
2,Whitney is a Great Hitmaker,"I received this ""Greatest Hits"" cd from a friend who guessed that I liked Whitney Houston's music. I think Whitney has produced some good music in her career. She has certainly produced a lot of hits. But something seems to be missing. No one can deny the great voice and overall talent of Whitney Houston. But I don't think she has reached her potential as a performer and vocalist. For that reason, I think she is overrated as a singer. This cd is for diehard Whitney Houston fans. Anyone else will be left cold."
2,This is NOT the same hit music we know !,I was disappointed because the songs I love have been re-arranged and I like the original versions far better. If you expect to own the original hits Do not buy this album.
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST!,"Need I say more! This is a collection of the greatest voice ever! Her phrasing, vibrato and POWERHOUSE vocals still go unmatched. This is the perfect collection for anyone who wants to own the best of the best!"
3,Whitney Houston's Greatest Hits-on 2CDs,"I liked the 1st CD with her slower songs,(which were as she recorded them), but the 2nd CD(called Throw Down)was all club mixes of her popular upbeat songs. They did not sound good at all. Big thumbs down!! If you like her upbeat ones as they were on the radio(just normal and not party with a constant jamming beat), then you won't like the 2nd CD. For instance, I loved ""How Will I Know"" when it first came out on the radio(just a sweet upbeat pop song), but with this club mix the song gets lost in the pounding beats(as all the her other upbeat ones do). Thanks for reading my review and I hope it helps!"
5,Whitney Greatest Hits,"The best collection of hits , enjoyed all her songs collection well put together. Still hard to believe she is not here. Thankyou again"
3,Singular,"The phenomenon that IS Whitney Houston was certainly helped along by the packaging -- that big-toothed-smile, brown-skinned beauty...But The Voice is undeniable and singular in pop perfection: The tone, power, control, range, conviction.God Bless her.You can't go wrong with a Whitney comp. HOWEVER, all the gems are unfortunately not here. And disk #2 is a hot mess of songs ""remixed"" into the monotonous Europop dreck currently infesting the airwaves. Better to buy the original albums (especially ""Whitney Houston"", ""Whitney"" and ""The Bodyguard"")."
1,Very Very Very Disappointed!!!,"All this CD is is a couple of songs from her early days and the Body Guard soundtrack with some remixes. I've always liked Whitney Houston's music and was happy when I came across this CD, but I as soon as I listened to it I was disappointed. ""That's it?"" was all I could say.Buy the Body Guard soundtrack instead of this one."
3,not all songs are greatest hits,"I loved Whitney Houston and was like many shocked by the news of her death at such early age. I had one of her earlier cd and thought this might be even a better one with much more ""greatest hits"" song. And it is not. It doesn't have as many of her greatest hits as it claims to be. I will keep this CD as my way of showing my appreciation to Whitney Houston. But I would not recommend this as a buy! as I think there are others of her CDs that have more true ""greatest hits"" songs then this one."
3,Not a complete collection!,"Whitney Houston - The Greatest Hits is extremely disappointing album. Where is I Wanna Dance with Somebody, How Will I Know?, So Emotional, and so many more. I am casual fan of Whitney's but jeez you would think they would include all her earlier hits. I Have Nothing, The Greatest Love of All, and You Give Good Love are the standouts here. I never was a fan of her Shoop, Shoop song from the Waiting to Exhale soundtrack - what a silly ballad! Whitney deserves better treatment than this!"
3,Quite...,"Well, the songs on disc 1 was quite pleasing to listen, but the remixes on disc 2 are annoying. That's why I gave only 3 stars. But this CD is quite worthy to purchase to people who doesn't have her albums."
2,Disc 2 is a bummer,This should have been only one disk; the first one! The only thing disk 2 had to offer was 'The Star Spangled Banner' performed live at the 1/27/91 Super Bowl XXV.
3,What's All The Griping About?,"OK....if you are complaining about the remixes on this CD, you should have noticed that very clearly on the back cover it says that Disc 2 is all REMIXES. So, how can you buy the CD and be disappointed? What you see is what you get. By not including the original versions of some songs, that ensures you'll go out and buy the albums they were on. Most of the ballads are here, with a few exceptions, and only 2 tracks on Disc 1 are tailored: the ending of ""I Will Always Love You"" is clipped, and ""You Give Good Love"" has an early fade-out. Most of the remixes are unflattering and inappropriate, but the ones that work are INCREDIBLE: ""Queen of the Night"" is given a fierce deep house makeover, and the newer ""It's Not Right, But It's Okay"" is very well-done also. Due to some missing tracks, and not enough good remixes, it gets 3*'s."
1,GIRLFRIEND'S PRODUCERS NEED TO GET A CLUE!!!,"Listen, I am a major Whitney Houston fan, but I swear I must be paying for Bobby Brown's bail because the second CD is the worst I have ever heard. Now we know that Whitney can throw down, (Mariah is NOTHING compared to Whitney), but to take all of her hits and dance mix them is not right. ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"" loses the meaning in a club mix. I felt like I was at a flaming disco!!!! This was a waste of money, and let me tell you something, Arista WILL be receiving a letter from me along with the receipt because I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!"
4,Great for hand quilting!,Needed one and this one is great for for pulling those threads through when hand quilting or for use when crafting.
1,forget this one,"Product is as pictured, looks and feels good until you go to use it. Very hard to open if you can open it at all."
5,CH Hanson Flagging Tape purchased thru Amazon,"The item was exactly what I wanted. I use flaggin tape in large quanties during my scouting prior to the opening of deer season. I flag my way in to my hunting area and when I find the place I am going to hunt, I use the flagging tape to flag the most direct route out (cheaper than a GPS). Some of my friends have gotten turned around while in the hunting area and know my methods. They have been able to follow my tape to the road and prevent them from spending long hours wandering in the woods. The flagging tape is very visible and reasonably price even with the shipping. It has other purposes in my day to day activities but I rely on it more during deer season than any other time."
4,Attention boat builders,"A very comprehensive book. Will be of interest to any boat builder, not only cold molders."
3,somewhat focused,"This book has a nice writing style, but had a focus on building the ""flattie"" style boat that I was not interested in."
4,Almost what I was looking for.,"As an avid reader of boatbuilding books, I would say that this one of the better ones that I have read. It's chocked full of useful details and good photos and illustrations. Almost a five, but I've read better. Easy to follow building steps covering all aspects of building boats this particular way. I say that because there's more than one way to skin a cat. If you are interested in building a quality boat, this book is one that you should keep in your arsenal. For an inexperienced want-to-be boat builder like myself, the cold-molding process is simple to follow and should yield a boat to last a lifetime."
3,For Beginners -- Good Basic Info,This is one of the draw backs to ordering a DVD with no ratings and no way to tell whether it's for a beginner or beyond. This is definitely for beginners. Info is presented in a clear easy to learn way.
2,I'd buy from a retail outlet...,"This product did arrive on time, but the rope itself was already cracking in places, and was very stiff. I have found a much higher quality rope at a local sporting goods store for about the same price... I recommend buying your jump rope from a local retail outlet!"
2,Good Product that Crashes Your System,"When I was deciding between Jasc and Photo Impact when selecting image editing software, I read the reviews about how Photo Impact caused system trouble for several users. I bought Photo Impact 8 anyway becuase I wanted their web page publishing features and I thought the other users might have simply had inadequate resources for a demanding application type. But I should have heeded the warnings of others. I had a brand new, bullet-proof 3 GHz Windows XP system, but after I installed Photo Impact, the system crashed once and ground to a crawl often-- even when the application wasn't open! Not a problem of resources, just a badly programmed application ""back-end."" Luckily, when I uninstalled it, the system recovered.As far as features go, well, they might have been the best for the money, but it's a moot point. Definately not worth the probliems the application caused to my system and the $89 lost."
4,Fine for home photos,"After researching several photo editing programs, this seemed to be rated the highest in my price range and by the number of options included. The program works reasonably well. I don't usually read instruction manuals and figured out most of the functions on my own. It locks up occasionally (on WinXP), but works fine after closing it out and re-opening. The number of added special effects are great (including lightning, meteor showers, etc.)"
1,Don't buy,Software doesn't work it had a money back guarantee I mailed the software back to them ( Ulead) and had proof they received it I no longer had the software and never received a penny from them. Rotten software even worse dishonest company will never buy any products from this company.
2,A Ram Hog that crashes alot is complicated...,"I bought this because people on this site and CNET gave it such a good review. I installed it on my W98. (the specs say it will work)It said it needed a minimum of 64MB of RAM, but it really needs more, and if I didn't shut down just about everything I had loaded on my computer it wouldn't load, or lock on loading. I am pretty savvy when it comes to computers and I find this program very complicated. It took me several tries just to get out red-eye! I put it on my laptop which has more RAM and XP OS and it works fine, but it still is very complicated to use. I do not recommend it for the inexperienced, and those who are you might want to upgrade to a more user friendly program-it would be worth the money!"
1,Stick with Photoshop,"Poor customer service, poor tech support, and no support attempting to obtain online training classes. At least one can obtain Photoshop training almost everywhere, including highly recommended training CDs/DVDs, etc. I'm going with that."
3,Comparing book with the Memorial Edition of 1912,"I find the reviews and the editor of the corrent listed book ""Sinking of the Titanic Thrilling Stories Told by Survivors"" interesting. My own copy is Blue Cloth with the same type of picture on the cover only the ship is going in the direction of the spine.My copy is called: MEMORIAL EDITION SINKING OF THE TITANIC THRILLING STORIES TOLD BY SURVIVORS and story authored by Jay Henry Mowbray, Ph.D..,LL.D. and published by The Mintor Company, Harrisburg, Pa. Entered According to Act of Congress in the year 1912, by Geo. W. Burton, The Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington D.C., U.S.A.This is a very interesting likeness to my own copy and if it is as interesting to read, is excellent study of human nature."
3,Not for you if you only want to learn to ski.,This book has information about skiing in general. I bought this book to learn skiing techniques and I did not like it that much. I wanted more illustrations and helpful advise to help me better my technique and this book does not provide much of that.
1,Waste of money!!!!!,I tried all morning with their tech support trying to get network transfer to work but still no dice. They escalated the issue and got back to me 3 days later asking me to check the timezone and time. Of course that didn't fix anything. I have since sold my old computer. Laplink has a no-refund policy. You bet I'll be disputing charges with my CC company!
1,Should have read reviews,"I bought this to make a transfer easy. I teach programming in college. 12 hours later of clean up, I am just about to erase everything and do a clean build. Good luck it either works or it does not work. I would be extra careful going between xp and vista"
1,Out of stock at Dell,I order PCmover when I was buying a new desktop from Dell. I saw the program when I was in the ordering process and thought it looked likea good idea. I recieved the computer as promised from Dell. The PC mover was back ordered. 3 times Dell call and emailed me that it would take another week to ship. I finally canceled. After reading these reviews I am glad I didn't get the program.
1,Don't buy PC Mover!,"PLEASE don't buy any edition of PC Mover. (I bought an early version and downloaded to the latest version on both computers. Even that process caused errors.) It comes with no instructions, and using it is NOT self-explanatory. It is complicated. I am very computer savvy so if I can't use it, you won't be able to either. It took me fifty tries, and several hours in online chats with their help support, and at least one nervous breakdown, before I got it to work. And THEN, the one piece of software that PCMover transferred for me didn't work. (Don't know why. Completely gave up at that point.) They have a help button you can push every step of the way, but it just tells you ""This is what's happening now."" If something's going wrong, and it's NOT happening, the help button offers no troubleshooting whatsoever. Useless. I seriously did become a stress mess. Also, you should know that they pay people to advertize on their sites."
5,John Lennon is Refresingly Innocent,I'm glad I bought this DVD. John Lennon truly embodies the spirit of the 60's that so many of us embraced. We were so naive.
2,Dissappointing,"Even though I'm a big Beatles and Lennon fan I found this to be a letdown. Especially after all the 5 stars it got from people here. I found myself squirming at times as John is so wound up. He is very anxious and the constant lighting up of ciggies puts me off. He looks to be wired and coked up to me. Cavett at times, even though he tries to look calm and in control, is clearly uncomfortable. Yoko Ono is always asking questions through John like a little girl. On the second appearance The Elephants Memory Band play the tepid ""Woman is the nigger"" and a Yoko song which is a complete waste of time. Ringo on the Donahue show (1995) is a way better interview. Only when Cavet allows the audience to throw questions at John does it liven up. Clearly the best part. Unfortunately its not long enough."
3,Wrong Color,A nice 5x7 faux leather frame but the wrong color! I ordered a black frame and I received a brown one. When I tried to reorder a black frame - it was no longer listed on the site. Not worth the money and time to send back the brown one that I didn't want. I had to order a more expensive faux leather frame from a different web site to get what I wanted and paid for - a 5x7 faux BLACK leather frame.
5,Yummy!,Good packaging and I like the reusable container the tea comes in :) the tea tastes delicious as well. I would deffinitly buy this again once what I have runs out.
2,Not Superior.,"The Jasmine flavor is VERY weak, and the amount of pearls represents a very low value for the amount of money paid to the quantity of product received. A couple of days worth of product."
3,"Jasmine tea, a bit chemical.","Ordered this on a whim. I drink a lot of tea and often order from a select few sites depending on the season. This Jasmine tea was just okay for me. Had the slightest bit of a chemical taste to it, nothing cloying but perhaps I am overly sensitive to it. Massively twiggy even for pearl type tea. Drinkable but I will stick with my preferred tea vendors."
4,Not review -- info from www.UpperRoom.org/bookstore,"I had to give it a rating to submit a review, but I have not read this book yet. I came to amazon.com to get more information about it after seeing it in the Upper Room catalog. Here is the information per the catalog: ""In Matthew's Gospel, four women are named in the genealogy of Jesus. They are Tamar, Raham, Ruth and Bathsheba. At the right time, these women appeared and made decisions that changed the future. They were empowered by God to step beyond the patriarchal structure on which they depended. This book challenges our understanding of how God works through our lives and in the larger world."""
3,Good Background Music,"Have you ever got tired of hearing the words of your favorite song, but you want to hear the background music. Well this CD is the answer."
1,Negatives outweigh the positives,"I bought the Little Green the day after we adopted a puppy. Although it does a sufficient job suctioning accidents out of carpeting, I would not recommend it.Positives:--Good at absorbing spills or other liquids from carpeting--Compact and easy to storeNegatives:--Dirty water pools in the bottom of the unit under the tank that collects the dirty water.--The unit then leaks the dirty water out the bottom while using it.--It is extremely difficult to clean.--The dirty water never seems to be fully emptied even after taking the entire unit and dumping it upside down.--It smells horrible! Even emptying it immediately after every use has not prevented it from smelling awful while using the machine. I think this is because the dirty water is never fully emptied. Hot, soapy water suctioned up after a clean up has not helped to remove the lingering smell."
4,Great for small jobs,"Very good suction, have had NO problems with leaking or spray not working, although I'm good at emptying out unit after use and cleaning it out a little (as instructions recommend)! Ready to use in minutes and works well with all carpet cleaning solutions. I happen to like the Woollite for carpets the best and it is great on stains too.If you're just getting a few stains here and there, this machine will do the job and quickly too. I've used this unit several times and really like it. We have a dirty dog and a toddler and white carpets -- but I've managed well with this cleaner. Great for stairs and sofas too (even red wine stains). I would not recommend it for doing larger areas (am looking at the bigger units now)."
1,Complete junk,"I used this a few times for our sofa and to spot clean carpets. The spray nozzle has always been a bit leaky but it did spray and if you didn't mind solution/water all over your hand, the spray was decent. Less than a year and less than 15 uses later it doesn't work. The nozzle doesn't work and the machine leaks so bad (even without water in the tanks) we have to keep it stored in a sink in our laundry room and it smells really bad the first time you use it if you haven't used it for a month or so. Save your money and buy something else. What a waste of money."
1,Unmitigated Disaster,"I bought this unit after a friend recommended it to clean pet stains, despite reading all the negative reviews. The first time out I used it on a stain about 6 x 8"", and I used Bissell's Pet Stain shampoo. Long story short: the stain got darker, and covered the entire area that got wet, about 10 x 12"". After thoroughly cleaning the entire unit, I refilled it with clean water, and tried spraying and vacuuming just that. After three passes, the stain had grown to 14 x 18"", PLUS there was a new, large stain adjacent to it where the fill tank from the machine had leaked copiously on the carpet while I was working. Couldn't get that stain out either. Now I have to have a professional come out and at least try to clean up both messes, and if that doesn't work, figure out what to do about a trashed new, very large area rug.Many folks gave a very low, negative rating to this product. Wish I'd listened to them instead of my friend!"
2,Won't spray after one use,"Used it one day for about 15 minutes, worked fine. It sat for a few weeks and it no longer sprays the cleaning solution. Tried to troubleshoot the problem per manual. No luck. Losing patience with this machine. Probably make a good boat anchor."
1,Do not buy this!,"As well as it's poorly designed tank system which you can never get totally clean, it just doesn't work that good in general. I have had this little green machine for a couple years now and only used it a couple times. The reason? Because woolite oxy deep and a rag works a million times better! It is more frustrating to pull out this machine and while you think it is going to be easier cleaning up a mess it isn't. i have to scrub harder with the bissel attachments then I would with just a rag. Save your money & buy some oxy deep!"
4,"Easy, effective, could use some fine-tuning.","We have 2 kids, a dog, a cat, and a lot of neighbors. We also have white carpet (it's a local thing - can't explain it.)What I like:1. Size - this is small and portable. Easy to store, easy to use.2. Convenience. It's pretty easy to add fluid to the cleaner basin.3. Convenience. It's really easy to empty the dirty water.4. Suction power - it does get the dirt out.What I would modify:1. I would put castors on this so it follows me as I chase down spots on the rug. Example - 1yo walks across a room with a grape popsicle (unbeknownst to Mom or Dad.) That's a 15-foot trail of purple dots.2. Put the fill-lid on TOP of the cleaner basin so I don't have to juggle the pointed-top container as I open the cleaning fluid and turn on the faucet.3. Allow the dirty-water basic to be opened and cleaned completely. We get debris up in there that can't be removed and it STINKS."
1,No spray,"I used this machine once successfully. The second time I tried to use it, the spray simply wouldn't work. I cleaned everything over and over again just as they suggest in the troubleshooting guide, but to no avail. One use for $70? I could've had all the carpet in my house professionally cleaned for that... Very disappointing."
1,Needs Improvement,"I read both positive and negative reviews on the Little Green. I decided to give it a try. The negative reviews proved to be more accurate. The spray nozzle never worked quite right from the start. When it did ""spray"" it just dribbled out and never hit the spot. I ended up spraying the cleaning solution on my spots with a squirt bottle, scrubbing with the attached brush and then sucked up the extra solution with the vacume."
3,Indispensable,"I have an earlier version of this product. (It is, in fact, all green) Since I have numerous pets, it is a life-saver for cleaning up the inevitable little carpet messes. However, mine leaks also and I must take care to leave it on linoleum after using - until it has finished making its puddle on the floor and dries up. I have no experience with similar products on the market, but think that when this one finally breaks, I will buy some sort of replacement from another manufacturer."
5,Great little machine,"Have had my Little Green for a couple of weeks now and love it. Have used it to clean up small coffee spots and some cat puke (hair ball) off a light tan carpet. Worked great. I used really hot water from my faucet and didn't feel like I missed the heating feature on the more expensive model at all. Also, instead of pouring the formula into the compartment, I took another reviewers advice; put a mix of water and formula into a spray bottle and used that instead--then used the Little Green for its spraying and sucking action with just the hot water. Worked great and saves a lot of money by using just a small amount of the formula at a time."
5,Love it!!,"We have had this for about 4 years now and it does an AMAZING job!! We have 2 dogs and 2 cats and it has saved my carpet and upholstery more times than I can count. I haven't had the problems with the dirty, smelly water because I empty and rinse the container after each use. This product is definitely worth the $$!!"
4,It's Grrrrrrrrrreat,"Yes, I stole the line from Tony the Tiger, but that's how I feel about the machine. I don't understand reviewers who claim it's hard to clean the tanks. Here's a thought...Read The Directions!!! They are so easy to clean a 3 year old can do it. As far as leaking water, is it possible your unit is defective, or you did not seat the tanks in properly? Again, a quick fix for that is to Read The Directions!!! It does take a lot of elbow grease though. At stair 9 of 13 I was getting tired of cleaning, but as I looked at the stairs I had done, I got a renewed burst of energy. The machine does not do a professional job. It was designed more for spot cleaning. If you want a professional job, call a cleaning company, or rent a carpet cleaner. All in all, for the price of The Little Green Machine it does a great job, is easy to clean, assemble, and use."
1,Bissell please pay attention to customers opinion for business success,"I got this product brand new from the box and I was very exited to use it at the begining because it was easy to use and not heavy but I was very dissapointed to find out the suction is really bad, from scale 1-5 this is a 1 barely any suction and for the price this is not worth it. Don't waste time and just so you can verify this review get one of this machines in walmart and test it you'll return it the same day and Bissell if you really want more customers to buy your products please work something out, so you can have more suction power into these machines, extra features will matter if machine works at customers satisfaction."
2,Not good suction.,"Everytime I've used it, I really have to press HARD on the suction wand. It takes FOREVER to get the water out. I would not get another one of these.."
2,Cheap Plastic parts,"The machine actually works pretty well. My issue is that the plastic covering that houses the brushed is cheap plastic. I'm on my third one in a year and the new one broke within a week of receiving it from Bissell. I had the same problem with Bissell's vacuums; cheap plastic parts breaking. I won't be buying Bissell anymore. Maybe it's just my family, we have 3 kids, 3 cats, and a dog so our cleaning products get a lot of use. Take it for what it's worth but it's not like we were doing the entire rug with the steamer. Again, the machine works well when things on it don't break."
2,Broke after only 3 uses,"This product worked great the first 3 times I used it. Now for some reason, the sprayer will not dispense any water. I can only use the suction part. Judging from other reviews, this seems to be a common flaw in this machine. Do not buy. Waste of money."
2,Performance decreases quickly,"When I first bought this product, I was extremely pleased. Then the little flap that lays atop the return tank didn't connect properly and the suction was compromised. Then I got bad leaks at the bottom of the unit. I used this unit only 10 times. I am within the warranty period and I am currently trying to get my money back."
4,Own It and Like It,"My husbadn and I own this and my husband is using it as I type this review. I really like it. It's easy to use and does a great job at removing stains in carpeting as well as the futon mattress as we are discovering right now. Our male cat is having issues and decided that the futon was as good as the litter box. The Little Green machine is taking out the urine stains plus the smell. It's taking some elbow grease in which my husband is more suited for, but it's working. We are not having any issues with dirty water leaking or not being able to empty and clean it sufficiently between uses. I recommend this machine for the price and the portablity of it."
1,This cleaner doesn't SUCK! (literally),"I bought this after coming back from vacation,and finding that my cat used my brand new couches as a litter box. It started out working fine for the first time I steamed the couches. Then I noticed that it seemed to be leaking from the bottom of the machine the second time. The third time I noticed that the trigger leaked solution water on my hands. The fourth time I was already used to the problems that I was encountering.I let my friend use the machine once to clean his bed because his dog marked his mattress. He gave it back to me letting me know about the leaking and what not.I come back from my last vacation to find that my cat did the same thing. I break out the Little Green to clean up the mess again to find that the machine doesn't suck anymore. There is no longer any vacuum after only 5 uses. This machine is not worth the time or the money even if you are desperate. Now I have to go buy a different cleaner so I can hopefully salvage my couches."
5,Awesome product,"I think this was the best $70 I have ever spent! It is small, easy to use, and great for stains, stairs and the cars!"

It would be nice if the software can link you to the State directly for filing."
1,Did not work as well as it should have,After receiving 2 collars (I have 2 barkers) one worked and the other didn't - so we changed the batteries. It still does not work (yes we filled them). The working one worked for a little while and now is very tempermental and our dog has figured out how to bark at a certain octave and not set it off - where other times it is going off constantly. I thought these would be a good solution - but it turned out to be a waste of money.
2,Dog to powerfully annoying for this collar,"Our dog simply battled his shrieking multi decibal bark through this hokey looking spray collar. It ran out of juice too quickly. If you have a really annoying dog that you never wanted in the first place but, your significant other took in and is now living with you, barking and whining like a tea kettle, I would suggest buying a shock collar or two or three. The spray collar probably works on less driven dogs but not on the kind who get a kick out of being an A-hole."
5,Pet safe,Better than the shock collars. Worked great until our dog learned to time his barks until the spray canister was empty then bark like normal.
2,It works until the dog chews it up,This was effective at reducing barking for about a week. But the collar came loose and my dog chewed it up when I wasn't looking. I ordered another one and the same thing happened again. They should make a collar that doesn't come loose.
2,Works but does not last..,"Works well as far as anti-barking...but it only last for a week and it will not spray any more even though it was refilled and battery was changed. Unfortunately, it can not be exchanged or returned since I bought it online and it is classified as hazardous item."
3,Anti-bark collar,"Well, the item was as expected and displayed, but my dog didn't really seem to care whether or not she was getting sprayed in the faceand continued to bark. I used it for about a week and then took it off of her. I'm sure it would work for a dog not so stubborn."
5,Silent almost immediately,"This product worked great, almost too good. At first spray, my dog didn't know where it came from. By second spray, he didn't want to get sprayed again and sat in the corner. There was no 3rd spray, he doesn't like to get sprayed. At this point, if he barks, i put the collar on him but i don't turn it on, he's very quiet when the collar is on.The only problem i noticed is that my dogs are very playful and sometimes the collar sprays when he jumps up and down and sometimes my other dog will occasionally bark in front of him and make it spray in his face.Overall, great product! I don't ever turn it on anymore, i just put it on him and he remains quiet."
4,No more complaints from the neighbors...,"I'll preface my review by stating that I rarely heard my dog bark before I bought this collar. She doesn't seem to bark hardly at all when I'm home.I purchased the Spray Sense collar after receiving complaints from my neighbors and roommates that she would bark a TON when I was away. (Our apartments have paper thin walls.)Since we started using the collar, I have received no further complaints from my neighbors, and occasionally my dog acts like a walking air freshener....win-win?"
2,product quit,"I received this product and it really does work but it only worked for 2 days then it has stopped working. I have refilled it and everything but it does nothing. It should last a lot longer than 2 days! I don't know if it could be the battery or the piece itself, but not worth the money if you can't use it!"
3,Works with limitations.,"Works pretty well for our trouble barker. Must keep collar on for it to work and fresh batteries fairly frequently and also frequent refills of citronella. That is to say, our dog quickly figures out if it is not on her neck or is on but not operational. Our collar lasted about a year. I called Premier and we went through their troubleshooting checklist and they said they would provide a new collar since nothing helped. Sounds pretty good until they say there will be a $25 fee. I am going to go ahead a buy a new one, since I figure $35 is worth it to me for a year of bark control and I am not sure what my $25 direct to the company will include, whereas I know the $35 buys a whole new set up with refill. Mixed feelings for sure, but I don't want to resort to the shock collar with our neurotic hound and I know this does work pretty well, when it works. Good luck to you all. The barking is so annoying! I feel your pain!"
1,Does not really work,"My dog absolutely hates anything near her face, especially if you blow or spray anything, so I thought this product would be perfect for her. At first, it startled her when the mist would come out, but then, she just accepted it. It seems like this product is for bigger dogs because the collar doesn't really fit her well (she's a small/medium sized JRT). The spray doesn't always come out properly...Overall, it wasn't a good fit for my dog. I was really hoping for a solution :("
5,Silence is golden!,"This collar is fantastic! My dog used to love to bark at night when it was windy. I tried a few other training and anti-bark methods/devices (sound box) that were unsuccessful and was a bit frustrated. After purchasing this collar, barking was no longer an issue. After being sprayed a few times, she quickly learned barking = spray. This device has not been a training tool for my dog. She knows when it is on and has realized that when it is not on, she will not be sprayed if she barks. On windy nights, I place it on before I go to bed and take it off in the morning after a great night's sleep."
1,bark collar,"Very disappointed. It would work when I barked into it, but not when my dog barked with it on, snug, different positions, whatever, no luck. Fifty bucks down the drain, but better educated, I guess."
5,"Works great, but not after a dip in the pond","This collar worked great on Lucy(lab mix), she loves to broadcast her presence; she learned almost immediately that she could not bark and sometimes resorted to a whisper-bark (cracked us up). It also had a very calming effect when taking our Dinah Soar (Catahoula) for a walk - forgot to take it off before she went for a swim in the pond....the collar does not like water! I'm ordering another collar because I need to get some sleep!"
1,A waste of money,"This collar did nothing to stop this dog from barking, infact, I think she enjoyed the citrus smell."
3,A-OK,This product is ok. I worry about the poisonous effects of citronella on my dog and by now she knows how to get the collar off anyway. Best used in small doses.
3,"Anti-Bark, but NOT Anti-Bite","I recently purchased this collar for my hound mix puppies, who seem to like to howl at pretty much everything and nothing in particular. I must say that the concept of this collar is great and that they certainly were surprised by the spray. It did seem to minimize their barking...for about three (3) days. Then the inevitable playing/wrestling maneuvers allowed the pups to get the collar off. Not sure how, as the nylon collar was securely fastened. Then the plastic housing of the device became a chew toy that was ill prepared to handle direct pressure from a dog's jaw. I found the device on the lawn in several pieces; which can no longer be attached to the nylon collar. A great concept, but just not tough enough if there is any play activity between dogs while the collar is worn."
4,"So far, so good","I have a male maltese who is not a ""yappy"" dog...except when people come home or a sudden change happens or when our other dog moves around the house. When he does bark though it is very annoying and noisy and sets off the other dog...From the moment I put the collar on my dog he knew something was up. He tried a little bark and when it sprayed him he got really confused and stopped barking. Same with the second time. He has learned that if he makes a low enough barking sound then the collar won't go off. But these are almost like whimpers and are more cute than anything else. All in all I love the collar so far. Will post more it things change."
3,Unhappy customer,"I bought two of these for my daughters dog and my dog and one of them does not spray, I bought them for christmas gifts and can not find the receipt to send the broken one back, I am thoroughly discusted that it is broken before I can use it ."
2,Don't do it!,"I purchased this because our Basenji mix does not respond to conventional discipline. He's very smart and he is apparently too smart for this collar. He doesn't like it when it sprays but he will bark until it's gone and then he knows he can just go to town. I give it a low rating not just because dogs are capable of figuring it out, but it's too sensitive. It goes off when other dogs bark and even if he just shakes his body it goes off. You also can't return it so I'm out $30 on yet another product that doesn't work on our intelligent dog!"
1,Citron is dangerous,"I use citron at work to clean machine parts. Citron based chemicals eat through grease, and are usually labeled as a #2 corrosive on the MSDS for hazardous materials. Why would you spray it on your dog? Unfortunately we don't have many laws to protect animals from harmful products. I make a pesticide called Raid, if you read the label for the flea and roach killer it suggests you should spray it on your dog but under the warning humans are to use caution not to get it on their skin. People have to use common sense and good judgment when manufactures suggest pesticides or cleaning agents should be sprayed on your dog. If you don't have time to train your dog properly, then don't get one."
2,Unfortunately......expensive to upkeep,"While this collar did work on my black Lab for awhile, it has cost me a small fortune to keep it up. The batteries, which runout very quickly, cost anywhere from $4-$10 to replace (and plan on replacing at least 1x per month) if you can find them (very hard to find the correct size). The Citronella spray refills, which, I will submit, last quite awhile.....cost anywhere from $11-$16, again, if you can find them!!!I've changed the battery so many times now, that the +/- posts are all bent, and no longer charge the device. I just spent another $20 to replace the battery and spray, and can't get it to work at all anymore.While I liked the idea that this was a totally humane method of stopping barking, I'm going to try one of the ultrasound devices now. At least the upkeep won't be so much.....9V batteries are easy to find and cheap, and there is no spray to get all over the place, find and replace."
2,Worth a try,"So we bought this for our 10 month old Shiba Inu-Chow mix, both breeds are very territorial so I think that may have something to do with it. It worked well at first, but I think it was the startling sensation of the spray that would stop the barking, she got over the collar in 2 days. I was really hoping this would work, but I think it honestly depends on your dog. Its worth a try but buy extra batteries, ours ran out in a week. We gave up on the spray collar after that and are currently looking for a sonar one now. And yes, it will make your dog smell like citronella, if you have a problem with that you should try the scentless kind."
4,Works - a little shocking to my dog,"Use this on my 3yr old Springer Spaniel. I only use it seldomly because it really freaks him out, but it definitely works. He also has an electric fence collar so he can't have both on comfortably so it's a little annoying to have to switch between the two. It even works if it isn't on; we had it on the table and he started barking and it went off...and our dog noticed and got distracted from his barking."
1,Doesn't work!,"I bought this and it doesn't work. Amazon says I can't return it because it's a hazardous material. So, you may want to buy this product at a store so that you can bring it back if it's broken!"
3,spray sense works?,"Got these and they worked fabulously for 2 weeks. Then the batteries went dead on all three collars! I am in the process of pricing new batteries, I have found them as low as $5 plus shipping for 2 online, but would prefer to find them locally for about the same. They do work, but I was disappointed in the short battery life. Maybe new ones will be better."
2,Not for All Dogs,"As other reviewers have noted, this type of collar may not work for long-haired dogs. The collar worked off and on for a couple of days on our 10 month old Australian Shepherd, but has been ineffectual since. This collar does simply not work well for dogs who have long hair that can cover up the spray nozzle, nor for dogs who are seriously committed to barking."
1,Not for long hair!,"This didn't work a bean, because the sprayer didn't make it past my Sheltie's long mane. This may work on short haired dogs..."
5,Great collar and great price!,"I was kind of hesitant to buy this collar but I don't like being shocked and I couldn't imagine doing that to my little guy. I have a english bulldog and I was worried that his wrinkled skin would make this collar useless, but I decided to try it anyway. It worked like a charm for my guy. The barking has stopped and it isn't painful, just annoying to him. I would definetely recommend this collar to anyone who has a problem barker. The only thing is you have to be consistent, everyday until they stop and then some. After a while they know the smell of the collar and you won't even have to turn it on! It worked great for my 1 year old bulldog."
3,Barking can be lessened.,"The collar helps to stop aimless barking, but when the dog is really excited, she doesn't seem to notice the spray and continues to bark."
2,While the Premier Gentle Spray might work for some...,"We've had no luck with this item, which we set up and placed around our mini schnauzer's neck with great hope. Our problem is a dog that barks in the car when we pass anyone waiting for a bus, riding a bike, playing ball, jogging, stopping at a red light in the lane next to us, walking on the sidewalk, getting into a car two rows away, getting into or out of a car parked next to us, and so on. We use the Gentle Spray collar only in the car, which is where the problem barking occurs, but all we have achieved is a citronella-scented dog. I give the collar two stars for quality, none for effectiveness."
1,Doesn't work on small dogs,I have a small Jack Russell and she never set it off. She would just bark and bark and bark and the collar never sprayed her. It would spray when I blew into it but it didn't work for us!
3,didnt work for my dog,It worked for my fox hound/red nose pitbull mix for a few days and then she got used to the smell and just kept barking while it would spray. On the brighter side it did make my house smell good.
5,"Music to my ears, finally","Premier Spray Sense Anti-Bark Dog Collar. I received this collar yesterday. When they say Silence is Golden, it definately is. I have a JackRussel/Bichon mix and boy she barked at EVERYTHING. This collar is Heaven sent. It is already working, and it is not a bad smell and it does not stain or leave coat with an odor. I can not believe it. The mailman, UPS man and my neighbors will be happy and I can watch t.v. in peace. She only had one fault and that was barking. She now has no faults. It was sent by ""As Seen on TV Products.ws"". I would definately deal with them again. They were quick with delivery and right-on about the collar."
5,Peace and quiet,Put it on our dog and presto she no longer barks. She growls as she has figured out that growling does not set off the collar. You have to replace the battery and the citronella on a regular basis but it's so WORTH it!
2,broke after a month,"worked great for a month and we were so excited! finally got our dog to stop barking! and then it broke. we added more spray, tried to clean it out, replaced the battery and still doesn't work. we can hear it clicking but no spray. such a bummer."
3,Anti Bark?,This didn't really work. It did when our GSD was first introduced to it.But after a while she realized she could bark thru it. And with that it was empty.Might be good with a dog who is not so determined.
5,Great Product/minor problems,"I was very skeptical about this collar. I have a very tenacious and enthusiastic barker, however, 2-1/2hr sessions with the collar cured him. Now I only have to put it on him and he won't bark- I don't even have to turn it on. The only thing I don't like is the actual collar. It comes loose while the dog is wearing it and should be stronger so you can use it to tie a dog outside. Both of these problems can be overlooked in light of the results."
1,unfortunately did not work for us :-(,"I bought the spray sense no bark collar for my Maltese. It worked like an absolute charm -- unfortunately it only helped for about a week. The collar was not damaged or anything -- my dog just became totally immune to the citrus scent. I did call the customer service number to ask why it would just stop working all of a sudden and she said, like anything, that there were no guarantees. I'm not against this product at all; I just want to let others know that if they have stubborn barkers like I do that it may not work."
3,One problem,I purchased this product a while ago. It worked great. Within no time the barking was under control AS LONG AS they were wearing the collar. The ONE BIG problem I had was within a month the product stopped spraying. I changed the battery but that didn't help.
1,Did not work with my dog.,"I ordered the anti-bark collar for my dog that sprays cintronella when she barks. The product did not work and we went through the entire can of refill spray. My dog did not mind the spray and barked anyway like it wasn't even there! I would like to return the item, since it did not work after 3 days of trying it. I was informed that we cannot return flamable materials, but there is nothing left in the spray can. Just want to return the collar. The product has a lifetime guarantee, but no information on how to return it if it does not work! Please help!"
1,no good for high pitch yipping,"I have a Tibetan Terrier who ONLY barks when left alone for long periods of time. So it was very difficult to test this product, since he won't bark when we try to make him. Still, we'd put it on and leave and the neighbors would complain when we got back. I finally called the company and the customer service rep asked if the dog has a high pitched bark. The dog has a VERY high pitched bark. Turns out, their older models (which they no longer sell) work fine with a high pitched bark, but the new model (the one with the on/off switch) doesn't work at all with a high pitched bark. They offered to change out our model for the older version, which I guess they keep in their warehouse for this very purpose. But, if your dog has high pitched bark, you're better off calling Premier directly and figuring out how to get the older model. Or find a brand that works."
3,Effective but often defective,"We have a large golden retriever who tends to bark too much, and the Gentle Spray collar has been a good option to control the behavior. Over the past 4 years or so, we've been through five different collars though, because they either don't work at all or work for a while and then die. The original ones didn't have an on/off switch--the new ones do, and that's a big plus of course, but despite this and careful compliance with the directions, they all seem to fail within six months or so. I've had them replaced under warranty, but still kind of a pain. I spoke to a very nice person at Premier Pet recently, and she said they have complained to their supplier about reliability. I don't know if there's a better product out there, and these do work, but don't be surprised if there is a defect or if it poops out (sorry) after a few months..."
1,Side effects,"Unfortunately, the second time I left my dog alone with the collar on for nuisance barking, it set off anxiety issues. After the fact, I learned this can be a side effect of bark collars, even the citronella. Needless to say its retired to a cabinet."
1,"Good for one, possible two hours.","Our dog ran to his water dish and washed his face. The collar stopped the barking for a couple of hours and then I think he ran out of citronella, so I refilled it and tried it again a few days later. Same thing. It worked for a couple of hours and then he was back barking again. So, it works for a few hours only, maybe for a party or something?"
1,Might as well throw money in the trash!,"I've had this thing for two weeks and it does nothing for my Beagle. I thought it would work because of these reviews here saying it's just wonderful. Some times it sprays, sometimes it doesn't. Whether or not it decides to spray, doesn't matter as she is fine running around barking with it spraying. So two weeks after the fact I'm lacking sleep and am stressed over this thing and I lost out on an amount of money that isn't meant to just try items that don't work!"
5,Worked better than I expected!,"My dog was somewhat of a problem barker. I got this collar and she DOES NOT like the citronella spray at all!! She was startled the first few times she barked. Now she doesn't bark except a very low barely-audible woof at the nothing-ness she used to bark at. She barely wears the collar now, had her trained almost immediately!!! I definitely recommend.I didn't find that the collar was too sensitive, it went off just when it should have. I didn't notice a scent at all from it, the collar really worked better than I ever would have expected."
2,Great - when the unit still works,"I've been through FOUR of these expensive units. They work great on my Great Pyrenees dog. At least they work for awhile. Then I end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead, then if the NEW batteries I put in were dead to begin with, and then I send it back for repair. Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that.So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a ""blue juice special"". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. At least they were cheaper, so I didn't lose as much money."
3,Works great (when it works) Short life span,"This product worked great on all my dogs. It is very humane. If the dog is sitting in your lap and you laugh out loud it will set it off and you both get sprayed. Also, dogs being pretty smart, within ten minutes of removing it they knew they could bark again. Unfortunately the collars only lasted about three to four months when they stopped functioning. The company would replace them, but I had to pay shipping. I was paying $100.00 a piece at the time, and after three replacements I reckoned it was too much trouble. Three stars for working great and two minus for short life span."
4,"Ahh, the sweet sound of silence!","This collar worked great for my dog - it was like a miracle! It only took a day or so for her to almost completely stop barking. The citronella smell goes away in just a few seconds. it doesn't linger in the air or on her fur, so it's not too bad. Have had it for about 6 months. I was hoping she would not need it after a while, but when the collar is off or empty or the battery is dead, she starts barking again.I would have given it 5 stars, but the item has had several problems. It developed a leak after about 2 months, and all the citronella leaked out. I was able to patch it with some glue, and it hasn't leaked any more. But now it has stopped working completely. I've refilled it and changed the battery, but it still won't work. The dog is barking more and more again, so I am going to replace it. Hope the next one lasts longer. But all in all, I love the collar. I'm only sorry i didn't get it sooner."
3,spray,Am finally getting the hang of the collar. Had to have it very tight because my dog has saggy skin and wasn't effective. Would have like the instructions to include something about that.
1,Disappointed Customer,This product did absolutely nothing for my dog except make him (and my apartment) smell like oranges. He barked right through the sprays. At one point he even managed to chew the collar off his neck (even though I am certain it was fitted properly). I wasted $50 hard earned dollars. Guess this just proves that here is no quick fix - or possibly ANY fix to excessive barking! I'm just sorry I couldn't give it zero stars!
2,Not so great,I was so excited to get this item for my dog cause he barks all the time but it did not work. It may have squirted him once while he had it on in two weeks. It worked when we blew into it for the practice try but after that it did not. I would not recommend this to anyone.
3,older dog,"My older dog didn't know what to make of the spray...so she kept on barking.I think part of the problem was that she had too much skin on her neck and the spray couldn't reach her face, no matter how many adjustments were made."
4,Our Dog Outsmarted The Collar,"We have two dogs; one German Shepherd that doesn't make a peep and one 16 pound mystery mutt (Jack Russel? Min Pin? Corgi?) that absolutely loves to speak his mind. For such a small dog, he has one booming bark. This collar actually worked pretty well for a couple of months... it's pain free, smells good, and he seemed comfortable with it on. Though eventually, he learned that if he turned his face while he barked, he'd barely get the spray on himself. He also realized that if he barked enough times the citronella would sooner than later run out. Nevertheless, I think this product is still worth giving a try and it's definitely a great value if it works for your dog(s)."
3,Worked for a few weeks,"For the first 3 weeks, this collar did limit my dog's barking. She would bark, back away from the spray, sniff at it, and then either bark at the smell (and repeat) or settle down.Eventually, she got used to the citronella and stopped caring. Now she's back to barking her head off and just sitting in a cloud of citronella.The special batteries are annoying to buy and only last a few weeks, even if you're really diligent about turning the collar off when it's not in use."
1,THIS IS COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!,"After less than 30 days of use this worthless piece of junk died on me. Bought a brand new battery and still won't turn on. This collar was used on my dog maybe 2-3 hours a day. When i tried to return it amazon's exact policy is ""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com."" Meaning I'm screwed. Do yourself a huge favor and do not buy this or if you must buy it from the local pet store where you can actually return it after it fails the same way it did on me. NEGATIVE STARS FOR AMAZON AND PETSAFE!"
1,Dog deodorizer,This has got to be the dumbest thing I have ever bought. Does it work? Not on my dog. At the rate my shepard is now barking I think that she has become addicted to the Citronella spray. Next I expect to find her laying on her back and barking to activate the spray every few seconds to keep her habit going. One good thing I have to mention is that she sure smells good and there are no mosquitoes in the area.
4,Helpful but not fool proof,"I bought this to keep a dog. He barked NON-stop and my wife had had enough. It is helpful. He learned immediately not to bark (overnight). However, he now whines because that doesn't seem to set off the spray. The bright side is the whine is quieter and more tolerable. Again, the collar goes on and the barking stops. I think there is a system that allows you to remote activate the spray. That might cure his whining too, just a thought."
3,Works well when it's full...,"We got this collar for our 60+ pound mutt. He's a great dog but when he gets outside he will bark at anything that moves. Birds, cars, planes, bees. With the collar on and a full tank he will bark once, it will spray and he stops. Excellent. But after 5-10 minutes he forgets and will bark again once and stops. This happens over and over again and it seems the collar holds enough for maybe 10-12 sprays (?). So after an hour or so it's empty and away he goes on his barking spree.I wanted to go with this before trying a shock collar but I'm sure our neighbors are hating us. So we'll see how the shock collar works out."
1,"good idea, but it doesn't work.",i refilled the container 6 times in the 1st 2 days.dogs don't care about citronella.this one hardly reacted and would actually be happy when i attached the collar.it still barks its head off when i leave the room.i want my money back.
1,Anti Bark Collar,"Unfortunately, this product didn't work for my two shelties. I was able to sell it to a friend to use for her two dogs (different breed) which seems to work for her. I am disappointed as I was so hopeful it would work. Probably nothing wrong with the product, it just didn't work with my two dogs, who I think would bark no matter what!"
2,Deliverd a different product than advertised,"The product that I received was not the same brand as the one advertised and that I selected to purchase. I did contact the seller, they informed me that a new manufacturer had taken over this product so I agreed to keep the product and give it a try. The cheap collar that came with it broke the first day my dog used the collar and he proceeded to chew the thing up. My entire experience with this collar was actually a waste of time and money."
1,Batteries DO NOT LAST,"We bought this collar for our little PUG who barks day and night, at the air, at dogs, at anything. The first day, it was really nice, it sprayed gently and she would immediately stop barking. The battery was out the next day and the collar had to be refilled almost every day, or more if she attempted to bark alot.I ordered more batteries. In two and a half weeks, we have used two very expensive and hard to find 6 volt batteries (had to order from Amazon, actually, ) and now the collar is just spraying occasionally and Lucy has caught on to its defective useage. I would not reccommend it at all, even if just for the fact that the batteries are so expensive and short lived and the spray has to be bought continuously and only from THIS company. Also, when I tried to return, the company said they do not deal through Amazon and must be returned directly to them. I thought Amazon stood behind its products and sellers???? Disappointing all the way round."
2,"may work for some, but not for me","Had heard from a friend that this worked for another friend of his, so I thought I would give it a whirl since nothing else seems to help. The first time I put it on, it did seem to work, and my dog seemed to back off from barking and looked dazed and confused about what was going on, but eventually, he powered through and decided what the heck, I don't care. I think he thinks the citronella is a form of cologne for him and makes him smell better. Anyway, I was hoping this would be the solution to my problem, but evidently it isn't. I would not go so far as to say ""it doesn't work"" as I do believe my friend and I do believe others who have said it worked for them, but it just did not do the trick for my wire haired fox terrier. He's two and half and a handful. Anyway, good luck if you do buy it, and I hope it works for you."
3,Good until it stopped working,"The collar worked really well, after using it for a couple of days my poodle realized that barking = sprays, so sometimes I don't even have to turn it on, just put it on her and she stopped barking. But 3 months later, the collar simply stopped working. First I thought it was the battery, but I replaced it and nothing happened (the battery is so hard to find here in Brazil, had to wait till someone go to the US to bring it to me). Conclusion: I had to buy a new collar, cause till now, it's the best solution for my dog stop barking."
4,Runs out of spray Fast!,"This works very well, but my dog used up his spray in about a day and a half. (approx 25 sprays per can). Also, the citronella makes me wheeze. If you have someone in your home with asthma then the scentless may be a better choice?"
3,"Deters some barking, not all","This product will work for many dogs, but when my stubborn dog meets another dog on a walk, she gets soriled up that she will continue to bark, in spite of being sprayed. There are times when the collar does help. My dog doesn't feel the need to bark at people as much as she used to."
3,Works but....,"This product is a great alternative to a ""shock"" collar, but with a few cautions. First, the collar microphone is fairly sensitive, so if you or your dog sneeze while you're holding him/her, you may get citronella in the face. Second, the collar can only be refilled with the kind of spray that it comes with, so be sure to order refills. Lastly, if you have a fairly strong willed dog, he/she may bark through the sprays sometimes. All that said, the collar definitely deters the barking. My dog used to run from one window to the next if he saw something outside, but, with the collar on, he calms down after he gets sprayed a couple of times."
3,It does what it is supposed to,"In as much as this collar does what it is supposed to, that is, it sprays citronella when the dog barks, I gave it three stars. However, it hasn't really taught my dog anything about barking. When he wears the collar it does encourage him to bark less but as soon as the collar is off he barks as much as ever. I was hoping it would eventually help teach my dog not to bark even when not wearing it but that doesn't seem to be happening."
3,Good place to start.,"I bought this product because my dog won't stop barking when tied up outside. When I first put it on her, she would bark and immediately get sprayed in the face. While it definitely helped her stop barking (at first), she quickly learned that if she barked enough, the collar would quickly empty and then she could continue to bark her little heart out. It was a pain to keep running outside to refill the collar as it doesn't hold enough spray at one time. She also went through 1 can of spray in 2 days. Another drawback, the dog smells after wearing the collar. I think the collar would work for the less determined dog but for us it was a fail. It may work if you are willing to keep refilling the collar every 10 minutes for a few days. It is a good place to start for those who don't want to use the shock collar like ourselves."
1,Does Not work,"The first time I used the product, the spray triggered at the proper amount/time. Since that time I have not been able to get the product to trigger a spray. The dog barks and the spray will not come out. I've tried troubleshooting the product and still it does not work. Definitely NOT worth the money"
1,sprays for no reason,I bought this collar in hopes of discouraging my boston terrier from constant barking. While it fits ok and does spray when he barks it also sprays when he shakes his head from being sprayed. I removed it from my dog after about five minutes. At first I thlught great he barked at the neighbors dog and he got sprayed howeever he was shaking his head from the spray and got sprayed again.
2,citronella collar feedback,"I recently purchased the citronella collar at the suggestion of my vet for a newly adopted highly energetic lab who was a problem barker. I did not have much success w/ this product and can say it worked about %50 of the time. Our most successful moments were often in the car, I'm not sure but wonder if this was because the citronella was more potent in an enclosed space?? She would bark continuously at times while the collar sprayed continuously in her face. Hopefully, others have had better luck. In hindsight, I would have liked to have read reviews and researched the product before purchasing, however, my haste to control the barking was a big motivator."
1,Not bad at detering barking but keep breaking,I ordered this about a month ago for my doxie and it works well for the nuciance barking. If someone comes to the door she barks right through the spray though. I would keep using it except the first one we got broke the first week so they sent me another one that just broke yesterday. I can't afford to keep replacing them every 2-3 weeks.
5,This Works!!,"I have 3 dogs and one is a german shepherd mix who loves to bark. It's that high pitched, nerve grating, neighbor annoying bark. As soon as this collar went on and he went out the door he barked once. That was it. The citronella sprayed, he didn't like it and was smart enough to connect the two. It's to the point now where the collar doesn't even have to be on to keep him from barking. Unlike some other reviewers, I have had no problems with the batteries and my collar stays in the on position for long periods of time. I just ordered two more for my mom who has 4 german shepherds and one mix. I let her borrow my collar and again it worked instantly and what was funny is since the dogs were all together and barking as a pack, when the one who was wearing the collar barked they all got sprayed and all stopped barking. This is a great investment for the money and is a really humane way of correcting unwanted barking."
4,"good product, but beware... dirt is bad..","Good product and did work for my dog.. However, once it got dirty (my dog LOVES to dig) dirt got in and now it doesnt work. I needed it for his barking outside and until this happened it was working well.."
4,barking coller,This product works well for my short haired dog. My long haired dog is not phased by it. I assume it is because the spray gets stopped by her fur.
2,short life span,"This produce worked great for about 2 weeks. The dogs were responding well to the training, although I thought it sprayed a little too hard. After I refilled it the second time, it just stopped working. I tried changing out the batteries and it still did not work. In the instruction manual, it says that the batteries might go bad even if they are not being used, so I'll have to try to get a new set of batteries and try those. Just be aware that this might be a problem"
3,Stubborn Dog Too Smart,"I bought the Premier Spray Anti-Bark Collar with citronella after talking to a few friends that tried it and had great results. Unfortunately, my Australian Shepard is a little more determined or smarter, or both, than their dogs. The spray collar slows him down for a while and then his instincts take over and he goes into ""protect the house mode,"" and barks. Seems like a great product, well put together and works fine, just consider the nature of your breed and the intellgence. A shock collar works better for my dog, but he knows when he has it on or off. Getting up and scolding him works best, but has to be done with each incident."
4,Anti-bark,I'm very pleased with the way the product works and would suggest it to anyone who is having trouble with a barking dog.
1,Only Sprayed for 3 days,"When we first received the collar it worked fine for the first 2 days, but then only after 3 days it suddenly quit spraying. I thought it was the battery, but it actually still clicked as if it wanted to spray but nothing was comming out even though the spray was filled with plenty of citronella."
2,Very Poor Quality,"I thought this collar was great at first. It really stopped my dog from barking. However, after about 3 weeks of use, the collar started leaking and would not spray. I have a small dog and I only put the collar on him for short periods of time. Very disappointed in the poor quality of the collar."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,It worked for three weeks and then sprayed my dog constantly each time we re-filled it. Even as I type it is spraying citronella all over my table!! Looks as though there will not be a full refund either!!Thanks a lot Amazon!
1,Not as described,"I have received the SpraySense instead of GentleSpray as shown in the amazon picture. And it already broke , the quality is very very low on the new ones, probably made in China. The older ones in two colors were a lot better.ITEM WAS NOT AS DESCRIBED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,didn't last,I bought this Item 2 months ago for my shitzu and it worked great but the quite lasted less then 2 months. The bad part is i can't contact anyone about it....
1,more harm than good,"The spray works, but the device is a piece of junk. The unit I got would fire the spray all the time at literally any noise big or small. My dog was a nervous wreck each time it went off. Tried all the troubleshooting tips from the company and posted in other reviews and still found it useless. ALSO, amazon WILL NOT RETURN it. Don't buy, spend a little more money and get and adjustable electronic one that works. I absolutely refuse to put this back on my dog."
4,useful,this collar is useful when it's on but dogs are smart and know not to bark when it's on and to bark when it's off.
2,broke quickly and isn't returnable,"While this product was shipped quickly and worked with minimal set up, it is not worth the money. My dog responded well to it, however, the bottom part that has the on/off toggle separated from the main part and hangs by a wire. I have tried and tried and tried to reinsert the little plate with the toggle switch, but it keeps falling out. And it can't be returned. What a total bummer. I only had it 2 months, so it is not worth the money. Had I been able to use it for a year or more, I would not be so upset, but two months is just not acceptable. Very disappointed."
2,Horrible Quality,"Ordered 2 of these and only 1 worked! Ordered a replacement for the one that didnt spray and the replacement didnt work either! For the 1 we have that works, we like it okay, but it does seem to spray our dog even when he is not barking. I would still buy this, but ONLY at a physical pet store where returns can be made without shipping back/forth as the quality control does not seem to be there in this product."
2,didn't work well for us,"Our terrier didn't mind the spray, she continued to bark....wish it would have had a different outcome for our 3 year old dog."
1,spray collar,"i had bought a different bark spray collar years ago that worked much better that this one. this one doesn't work correctly, while i'm putting the spray in, it's coming out the other opening at the same time. i'm going to call the company and find out what's wrong. also, the spray will release into the air when the collar is not turned on. at this point, i wouldn't recommend buying this brand."
2,Not The Results You Want,"Our dog hated the citronella smell... so it's a very effective correction tool. However, once this device goes off, the entire unit smells like, and is covered in, the citronella. This causes 2 issues... 1, the dog never stops smelling citronella therefore is always being corrected even when not barking and 2, it desensitizes the dog to the corrective smell therefore making it eventually ineffective in correction. Our dog hated the smell so bad, she would go into full on panic attacks smelling it, with or without the device having sprayed her... that's great if they only smell it during the bark... but the smell is EVERYWHERE. WIth the sensitivity of the dogs sense of smell, you might as well shove their nose 24/7 in a citronella candle. If they can ever figure out how to correct this issue, it will be effective."
2,Dog smells like Citronella...,"Unfortunately, the collar didn't do anything for our dog. I've tried the collar multiple times (went thru the refill can already), but she is very happy to just be barking away. The only effects I can figure out in our case is that we are out $80, and the dog smells like Citronella.On the positive side, the device has been pretty durable and sits on the dog well. Citronella just didn't work for us."
3,"Works well, but batteries don't last long","We have an invisible fence, so we didn't want to use an electric collar as it might confuse our dog. This works well when the batteries are new, but we have to replace the batteries no less often than every 2 weeks (even if he hasn't been barking much). They aren't the easiest batteries to find either - Target seems to have the best deal - you have to get them in the photo dept. If the batteries lasted I would give it 5 stars."
3,Didn't work for a Pomeranian,"Unfortunately, it did not correct nuisance barking with my Pomeranian. I'd fill it up before I left, and come home to find it empty. After watching video that I recorded of him while I was gone, the product worked flawlessly, but unfortunately was no phase to my dog.Please do not let this review turn you away from trying the product. It's definitely worth a shot as all dogs are different to responding to things."
5,The Best Customer Service,"I have had my bark collar several years now and only rarely have to use it. I have lent it out to others who have had amazing results and returned it to me when they were either through with it or had bought their own. Well recently I went to use mine and it didn't work, I tried a new battery, and made sure it was full, when it still didn't work I called Premier for customer service, THEY WERE SO NICE, they said that there is a lifetime warranty and to just send back the bark box..........well my bark collar was an old one without an on / off switch, I sent it back 9 days ago and today I received a brand new collar with an on / off switch, a new battery, and a new refill can ALL AT NO CHARGE.......GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!"
2,ok,"This collar didn't work well for my Pomeranian. Her high pitched shrieks just didn't seem to set it off. However my husband and my brothers started barking into it after a few beers and I've never laughed so hard in my life! Their ""barks"" certainly set it off!"
2,citronella dog collar,"The collar worked great for the first week, however the sprayer would stop working after awhile. I made sure to check the battery, citronella, and for any clogs. I have had to replace the collar 3x's already because they continue to stop working. Also, after awhile my dog got use to the spray and is no longer bothered by it."
2,Worked at first...,"Like others who have written a review, the product worked magic for our dog for the first day it came in the mail. It failed to work the second day so I bought replacement batteries. The battery lasted a day and was not consistent in working when she barked. At times, the spray was delayed after she had stopped barking. This product is unreliable and has not helped us train the barking out of our dog. I plan on ordering a replacement collar but am not counting on anything"
4,outstanding results from the first day,"Our dog was escalating into a protect mode at every stray noise and bark in the neighborhood.This collar was comfortable, easy to adjust and having used it for several weeks, continues to stop the barkat one or two at most regardless of the situation. Cost effective and recommended. Used for our overly protectiveGerman Shepherd female."
3,"It worked well, but...","The collar worked great for my dog, it seemed to be the right product to use (the shock collars never worked for her).A few downsides..I found it expensive to maintain (the batteries and spray). The collar did go off if there was any loud noises in the environment, or if the other dogs barked...I felt bad!It also stopped working about 6 months after I first bought it. Although that's not a horrible track record, it could be better...I'd hoped to get a little more use out of it :(."
1,third one died today,"This bark collar did keep my dogs from barking when I wasn't home, but the collar doesn't last. A lifetime warranty doesn't mean anything if every 6 months you need to replace it.On all three of the units I've had, they start to leak and malfunction after less than a year."
2,"Good idea, bad design...","I purchased this bark collar for my little bichon/yorkie puppy and it worked great for two days, until she figured it out. It definitely stopped her from barking but the design of the collar is horrible. The box is rather large (my dog is 12lbs) and the battery is located on the top of the device where the citronella shoots out. Unfortunately even though we put the collar on tightly, my dog is able to bite the top of the box and get to the battery pretty easily. The battery should not be located on the side near the dogs mouth. It is very easy for them to pop the cover off and pull the battery out. We cant even use it now."
4,Anti-Bark Collar,"The anti-bark collar really does work. We have a coon-hound who are notorious for barking. She used to bark a great deal in the yard, especially at night. Now with the anti-bark she might let out a short bark and than it is over. She does not like the citronella at all."
4,"Excellent product, a little bulky","We got this collar to teach our minipoodle not to bark so much. It works, without being harsh. She now attempts to bark quietly or growl rather than her prima donna soprano shrieking that she was known for.The only minor negative point is that this collar is kind of bulky for a 10 pound dog. It would be just fine on a dog maybe twice her size.Overall, it's exactly what we hoped for."
2,Worked until it malfunctioned.,It worked well for my Beagle until I replaced the battery. Now it sprays once and then leaks the rest of the citronella. It continues to leak even if the battery is removed.
5,Immediately eliminated excessive barking!,"Worked perfectly- my neighbors do a lot of yard work, and for some reason, my dog just can't stand to let them pull weeds in peace. Rather than confine either the dog or the neighbors to the house, everybody is happy now! The dog runs around the yard, the neighbors don't go deaf, and I don't have to yell at the dog. It literally took five minutes for her to decide that a surprising puff of citronella was unpleasant enough to go mind her own business. I didn't like the idea of shock collars, and the added benefit of the citronella is that it keeps mosquitoes away. She does a low ""woof"" sometimes, that does not set off the spray- which is fine. It is nothing like the loud, sharp barking that she used to do. She seems to know exactly the tone she can use with it now. Excellent and humane product, and they sell refills everywhere.In case anyone wants to know, she is almost 4 years old, and a Schipperke/Lab mix."
2,Extra Sensitive,"We had difficulty getting the product to work at first but after replacing the ""new"" battery that came with it everything worked fine. The spray startled our ever barking cocker spaniel and she was just starting to catch on to the connection of barking and spray. We were watching a movie on television which had gunfire. We noticed the dog jumping around and then realized that the gunfire from the t.v. was setting the collar off (she was across the room and the t.v. was not loud). We also noticed that my husbands laugh set it off too! I don't know if this was a fluke collar, or all the collars by this company are this sensitive, but it's definitely not going to work with our dog."
1,CRAP~! Anti-Bark Spray Collar,"Spray Anti Bark CollarNo matter where I buy these they stop working...after a very short time. I have bought from Petsmart, Amazon, Ebay etc. This one broke after 3 uses. What a piece of crap product. They should all be recalled."
5,This works for my dog!,"This works for my dog! We adopted him and he came with this collar. We did not use it as he was not barking so much until we adopted an additional dog. New dog chewed up and destroyed the collar. I had to buy another one and came to you for replacement. If New dog needs to eventually have one, I will be back."
2,It is too sensitive.,"The collar works to stop the barking, but it also sprays with just a low growl or a yip of excitement. It is just too sensitive. I thought I would be able to adjust the level so that he could at least make a little sound. We just wanted to get rid of excessive barking!"
2,poor durability,"Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog CollarThis was the third Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar in less than two years for a vocal miniature schnauzer. It is very effective, but the collars don't last very long. The first one lasted about six months before dying. The second lasted a few months before the internal reservoir sprang a leak. The third one was defective when we received it. Fortunately, simply wearing the broken collar has some residual effect on reducing barking."
1,The Sprayer Got Stuck!,"The product worked okay to deter barking but I am glad that I was at home when it malfunctioned!My dog came dashing under my desk and she was pawing feverishly at her face and I could smell the citronella...the stupid collar was continually spraying! I couldn't get it to stop!I put my had over it to stop it from getting into her eyes and I pulled the collar off. I had to take the battery out to stop the spray!I will NEVER use a training collar again, imagine if it was an electronic shock collar that malfunctioned like this???I felt so bad...so guilty."
4,Turn Down the Noise,"We have a small dog who thinks she is the Alpha of the pack, that is the human family she lives with. After 11 years of her barking through the window at people walking by our home we decided to teach her a new trick: silence. We thought it more humane than the battery-shock version, and the collar does work. The only issues: take it off before picking the little one up or you'll get a face-full of citronella, and the batteries are pricey/available only mail-order. I was told one may use a stack of button batteries, but I have yet to find the correct ones locally. The spray may also prevent mosquitoes from biting. Currently, we are working on the ""as seen on TV"" $10 Bark-Stopper. It works on a 9 volt and I can keep in the yard with me for the neighbor's dogs."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this product for my hyper-barking dog, and it seemed to do its job well for a few days before it suddenly stopped working. I refilled the citronella and replaced the batteries but no dice. I wrote the company and they immediately offered me to send them the product for a free replacement (I have no complaints over their customer service). But when the new product arrived it was the same story - it worked for a few days then nothing. Not sure what the technical malfunction is, but this product is simply faulty."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I bought this for my doberman at a pet store. I had originally gone in there to buy a shock collar, but a sales associate convinced me I shouldn't because of his breed. She said that it could make him more aggressive. That did worry me, because he can be aggressive with other dogs, and I have two others, so I decided to try the spray collar. It KIND OF worked for a week maybe, but eventually it stopped spraying when he barked, would end up on the side of his neck or for some unknown reason was not keeping him from barking. Also, the citronella seemed to run out very quickly and needed replacing often. I would say that unless you have a dog that is very timid and scares easily, this collar will not work for you. This isn't going to stop a determined dog. I did end up getting a shock collar (SportDog) and it has worked WONDERS!!! He hasn't shown any aggression whatsoever!!"
2,Citronella Spray is weak deterent,"The system works as advertised, but my dog doesn't seem to be bothered by the citronella by the spray. It's just not very effective with my Aussie."
1,Stopped working,"Lasted all of 30 days before it stopped working. After replacing the battery multiple times and refilling multiple times, it just won't work. Just stopped."
1,Aweful - doesnt work,"This thing never sprayed when on my dog. Its fairly heavy so NOT for small dogs. Its very awkward and ugly looking. After putting it on my pomeranian for a day, she still barked, the container of fluid was empty but she was not wet?? Waste of money!!!"
4,"Works Great, But Wish It'd Last More than 25 Sprays","Only downfall of this is that it will only hold about 25 sprays worth of fill. I wish it was more like 100 sprays. A dog that is barking for whatever reason is surely to bark more than 25 times in a long, typical work day, 8-9 hours. Other than that it works well. Easy to refill. Would like a gauge to see how much fill is inside of the unit. But you can sort of hear it filling and when it fills, the small sound stops.I had to buy many more refills. EntirelyPets sells them at a nice price, free shipping, on Amazon.com.The battery is lasting a long time, but I turn it off when my dog isn't wearing it. So that must save a lot of the power.I like that it has an on/off button.The 4 stars is only due to the limited 25 sprays per fill."
3,Citronella Bark Collar,"The collar is a marvelous idea and when collar is charged it works quite well on the dog for which I purchased it. I believe the apparatus I received is malfunctioning because it only holds a citronella charge for two days although the dog isn't barking much at all anymore. Despite that little problem, the dog has reduced its barking to those occasions when there is a reason..i.e. a coyote passing thru, a vehicle approaching...etc. After several years of being awakened at night Babe no longer barks just to hear herself bark!!On another note, I received the product very quickly."
3,works ok,i have 3 dogs works great for my beagle & pug but not for my jack russel so i would recommend for some dogs but not all.
2,Bark Spray replacement,I need to return this product. Does not work properly. Would like a replacement of same.
2,"May work for some, but not for us...","This seemed to work well at first but our dog quickly got used to it and it no longer detered him from barking...I have heard it works well for some, it probably depends on your dogs personality."
5,"Great, Very Pleased",It worked right away. I have two dogs about 70lbs each. It worked the first day. They bark very little when on. The citronella collar was recommended by my Vet.
1,Collar did not work!,My dog quickly learned to turn her head away from the spray. Do not buy this collar! It does not work!!!
1,Absolutely Useless,"This collar has absolutely no effect on our springer spaniel's barking. She just barked and barked until it emptied out. Over and over again. The stuff smells okay and the collar is easy to set up and use, but then it doesn't help. I've been meaning to try and return it."
3,Worked for a while,"Our dog seems to want to bark when it is dark outside (like very early in the morning). We didn't want her to wake the neighbors so decided to try this. It worked great at first; stopped her in her tracks. However, the longer she wore it, the more she got used to it. It does still limit her barking somewhat, but not entirely. It does not take common batteries, so hard to find."
5,Excellent,"Once my Shih Tzu discovered how to bark, she never stopped. We didnt want to buy the shock collar, so this was perfect! As soon as she smelled the citronella, she realized she didnt like it. The spray doesnt go in her face either which we like because we didnt want to hurt her, we just wanted her to shut up!"
1,Worthless,"I purchased this collar, put it on my dog and it worked for exactly two barks. After that, nothing. I changed the battery but to no avail. This product is a total disappointment. (Oh, but it worked fine for the first two barks.) I would give this product zero stars if that were permitted."
4,Works great -- but they work out when it's empty.,"I am very grateful to this product, because it solved the problem I needed solved -- it stopped my young lab from barking down the neighborhood every time we went out and she was left behind. For the first two weeks she didn't bark at all with the collar on, but after that she worked out how to bark more softly, survive the gentle spray, and discovered that eventually the collar ran out. Then she will bark, but still only once or twice. I check the collar every morning now, when I put it on her, and we are golden. I am so thrilled, because my neighbors were getting pissed and, to be fair, I didn't blame them. Totally worth it, and cheaper on Amazon than at my local petco, at least right now. Yes, it runs out pretty quickly (like every other day, it would seem) so once you see if it works I would go ahead and order some refills and extra batteries."
1,It doesn't work,Just got it yesterday. Doesn't work at all. Going to try to get new batteries and whatnot today. I know someone previously mentioned this but I neglected to take warning: you can not return this item to amazon. So even if it doesn't work -- it's all yours.
3,Works great but is wayy too sensitive,"Our little puppy used to bark and bark and after we got this collar she tested it out a few times looked around all confused and stopped. Sometimes when she forgets she has it on she will give just one bark and stop, it's a great improvement from her previous behavior. I do have to complain about one thing though, the collar is way too sensitive. If she burps or sneezes or even scratches and hits the collar, it will spray her and feel terrible every time she gets sprayed for one of these reasons because she's not doing anything wrong! We called customer service and they just told us that this collar was just was one of their more sensitive products. Personally I would suggest getting one of their other collars. They said they had a few different options (any of which I do not know the name of) but would probably be a more humane fit. They should NOT be this sensitive although for barking, it works like a charm."
2,Great At First,Purchased two collars for two indoor dogs. Both collars worked great for the first few weeks before one suddenly quit working all together. The second one failed too several days later. We have replaced batteries but to no avail. A disappointing purchase as we are beyond the return period and have two collars that are worthless. Like the concept but the execution on these is not ready for prime time.
1,Does NOT work,"Bought two collars for two different dogs. Small dog, about 20 pounds, is too little to activate dog collar. Big dog, about 85 pounds, is undeterred by spray. Would not recommend."
1,"Bought 2, both are broken within a week","My dog's barking seemed to decrease within a few uses of this product, that's why after the first one broke after only a week I ordered a replacement. The first one sprayed the Citronella as soon as it was refilled, even when on the off button, and the second one we used for one day, I went to refill it, and nothing happened when I blew on it to test it. I exchanged the battery just in case, used a different refill bottle, and nothing! One week for the first, 1 day for the second!!!!! Our dog is a 2.5 lb Maltese kept inside, so it's not excessive wear or water damage. Poor quality! Great potential!"
1,Bye bye $$$$,It just didn't work for us. We have an Aussie Terrier and he had no problem being sprayed. Couldn't have cared less. And we found the collar difficult to use. I felt really dumb for having bought it in the first place. :=(
2,easily broken,"I was so excited to have this collar, but had a hard time getting it on our dog...most definitely this was user error, but it is confusing! once I got it on, my dog ran outside, and within 15 minutes had figured out how to pull/chew the collar off. We never got a chance to see if the spray mechanism worked or not."
2,DEFECTIVE- Breaks quickly,I bought two of these. The first one didn't spray after a week or so. The second did spray and continued to spray even when the dog was not barking. Two purchases and two defective units. It's a nice idea but poorly executed. They should make this unit smaller and far more reliable.
2,Bark collar,"My old dog is 16 years young and finds a lot of nothing to bark at. Thought this would be a humane way to save him from the neighbor's automatic weapons. Unfortunately the thing completely unravelled the first night. You buy this, make sure you melt the ends of the collar well. That doesn't stop it either sometimes. The spray worked on him the first night. He got used to it though and barking meant more to him than the spray was irritating I suppose. Didn't work so he's still in his flack jacket."
4,Awesome response,"I have a 7 years old fox terrier, super hyper and of course a barker, to the point that i've been warned by neighbors to fix the problem or get rid of her...I just got the collar and tried it on, went downstairs and as soon as I was going out she started barking and got sprayed, stopped...barked again and stopped, she realized there was something wrong going on, and even tho she didn't stop barking for good...(she even emptied the spray of the collar) she didn't even bark as much as she would normally do, that's why i'm giving 4 stars, and depending on her behavior on the future I'll update and I'm willing to give 5 if it works as it did on the first try."
5,Amazon purchased Dog Collar,"This is a great product, I have three schnauzers and they are terrible at barking when people come to the door, I just put the collar on the loudest one and he stopped immediately, just wished I could afford three of them."
4,Effective,"Our dog had continually barked out the window at cats, other dogs, squirrels, etc. and we had very little luck in stopping him. His barking was at a point that it was driving us insane and we were at our wit's end. We heard about these collars as a more ""humane"" alternative to shock collars and decided for $30 it was worth a try. It only took him barking with it on 2 times and the problem had stopped. The only negative is that he has figured out he can growl and the collar won't spray him. However, the growling is much more tolerable than the barking."
2,Premier Spray Anti Bark Collar,"Purchased this collar for a very barky dog which did nothing to alleviate the problem. He still barks and the citronella scent does not appear to bother him. The battery does last however, the casing cover does pop off easily."
1,Not as advertised,"This came with very complicated instructions and the caveat that once you stop using, your dog will, indeed, start barking. It requires the dog wearing for several days before using - I've had the collar for a few weeks and haven't had the time to even start with it because of it's cmplexity."
5,Miracle worker!!!,"I had just moved into a new condo with my 10 year old cockapoo. Within a week of living there my new neighbors were ready for us to move out. My dog would bark her head off, but only when I wasn't home. Luckily a friend recommended that I get this collar. I wasn't really expecting it to work since my dog is so old, but was out of alternatives. I am SOOOO happy I bought this. Within 30 minutes of her wearing the collar her annoying barks had turned to a very low grumble, within an hour she wasn't barking at all. (We practiced with her by ringing the door bell).It has now been 3 weeks and I put the collar on her when I leave for work and she doesn't bark at all. One of my new neighbors stopped me last week to thank me for being so quiet and she asked me if I had gotten rid of my dog because she hadn't heard her for 3 weeks. With the help of the spray collar, I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks!!"
2,anti bark collar not 100%effective,"I have 2 Yorkies. I thought for sure this would deter their barking at people and other dogs while in the back yard. I am not sure if they bark and the spray runs out too quickly, but after a day or so- they are barking at full force with their collars on. I have replaced the battery to troubleshoot, but the barking continues. I have NEVER been unsatisfied with anything I purchased from Amazon before, but I am very dissatisfied with this product."
3,WHY IS THERE NO WHERE TO TELL YOU GUYS YOU SENT IT TO THE WRONG HOUSE!,My order was shipped to the wrong address and get sent back. Why is there no where to tell you that i need it resent!! THIS IS RIDICULOUS
2,Doesn't do any good with a smart dog,"I think my dog is just too intelligent for this. She quickly figured out that she could just bark until the citronella runs out...which was just a small annoyance, not really a deterrant. She also was able to shift the collar's position so it didn't spray her straight in the face. The citronella collar might work for a dumb dog but not for my australian shephard."
1,please don't scare your dog this way!...,"...if you feel the need to resort to a product like this, re-evaluate whether you are spending enough time with your dog. These products are cruel and scare and confuse the poor animal--like the shock collars. If you are thinking of this, please try reliable low price pet training classes at Petsmart or Petco. Thank you--an animal lover and WITH TIME and patience, owner of 3 well behaved dogs"
1,Poor quality,"Worked for a few barks then stopped, filling the canister mulitple times did nothing. Save your money."
4,Great product to stop the barking,"I heard about this product from a friend and am glad I did. It has lived up to my expectations completely. My dog, a female schnauzer, consistently barked at all my neighbors each time I walked her in my condominium community, regardless of the number of times she encountered them. Since purchasing the anti-bark collar, she has learned that it is not acceptable behavior to bark at neighbors or other pets while she is on her leash with the anti-bark collar on. She is able to hold her expression to a low bark."
2,Spray & batteries don't last long,"We have a toy poodle that barks and grumbles at just about any noise. Have had enough so we bought this product.At first the dog was freaked out by the spay, (the house smelled good) but the container that holds the spray is used very quicklyand I think the dog caught on to that. The batties also dont last that long. I would take it off at night (yes I would shut it off) and in the morning before going to work Iwould put it back on so when I came home I was not arriving home greeted by his barking. I found that we were either dealing with... container empty of spray or batteries dead... ?Time to move on to a shock collar...."
3,The spray didn't bother my dog!,"One of my dogs is, well, difficult. He spends the day outside in a yard and barks a lot. I hoped this would help him break the habit, but he didn't mind the spray at all. The collar worked fine, spraying a squirt up into his face every time he barked. But he didn't care. So he barked for a few minutes, emptied the reservoir on the collar and then kept barking. He did smell nice, though.My dog is a 60ish pound lab mix of some sort; perhaps this works on smaller or more ""sensitive"" dogs?Again, collar was just fine, just had no effect on my dog."
5,MY BARKING NEIGHBOR,A NEIGHBOR TURNED ME IN BECAUSE MY MALTESES BARK A LITTLE. HE EVAN HAS A BIG DOG OF HIS OWN. THE HUMANE DEPARTMENT WAS GOING TO GIVE ME A $100 FINE FOR EACH OF MY DOGS. THIS COLLAR HAS WORKES WOUNDERS. AFTER A FEW DAYS THEIR BARKING WENT DOWN TO VERY LITTLE. NOW THEY BARK HARDLY AT ALL. WHAT A WOUNERFUL PRODUCT AND SAFE AND EASY TO USE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO HAS AN ISSUE WITH BARKING. THANKS FOR THE HELP. NO BARKING MY MISTY
2,dissapointed,"Unfortunately this collar sucks... it sprays my dog for no apparent reason... There is no way to adjust the sensitivity of the unit. The collar has a ""snug 2 finger fit"" around her neck and her normal collar is removed.. if she jumps down the back steps it goes off... If she shakes her body at all it goes off... I have yet to see it work on a bark. I'd return it but I don't have the packaging..."
4,Great Product,"I absolutely love this product. We have two dogs, a maltese and a yorkie/shihtzu mix. The Y/S has a very low bark, and is rarely vocal, so we have not had to use it on her, but our Maltese loves to show everyone who the boss is. As soon as the collar goes on, we no longer have to deal with the loud barking/howling. This product does not work for the more quiet barks, but those do not disrupt others or our baby sleeping, so we are okay with them. If our dog does bark, it's only one time. The citronella sprays very suddenly directly in his face. He doesn't like the smell nor the fact he is being sprayed, so it works great! Leaving only 4 stars due to the fact that it doesn't prevent all types of barking."
5,I was amazed!!,"I was reluctant to try this collar, because it's not really positive reinforcement. But Benny's barking and lunging at other dogs, bicycles, children, motorcycles, people in wheelchairs, push scooters, etc. had gotten so bad that walking him was anxiety time for me.The citronella collar is such an instantaneous distraction and he very quickly learned to ignore a lot of the things that would have caused him to go crazy before. Now going for a walk is relaxing and fun for both of us, and he seems much calmer overall.The only downside is that it is ""one size fits all"" and seems pretty heavy for a small dog. I used it on Benny for a few days without filling or turning it on, to acclimate him. Other dog owners see him with the collar and ask about it, and I heartily recommend it. Don't wait any longer, hoping that your dog will stop his barking."
2,Not what I expected,"I have a pomeranian and this item was too large to put around her neck. In addition, it could only hold enough citronella spray for one or two barks and then it needed to be refilled again. I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Spray Collar,"For our dog, this product seemed to work for about two days. But after that point he just got used to the spray and does not seem to mind anymore getting sprayed in the face.Our first spray collar did not spray every time. Only every third or fourth bark. So we returned that and got another which is more reliable but he has become immune.We did try it on our other dog and she did not like the spray. She has stopped barking when she wears it. My older dog is hopeless."
1,Not for all dogs,"After reading all of the reviews and being frustrated with my dog, I broke down and bought the collar. Within minutes my dog was sprayed, however, he didnt bark yet. The device sprayed my dog for swallowing, yawning and whining. My dog was scared to death and was shaking and cowering at my side....and he's an 80 pound GSP. I understand it works for most dogs but I've seen a couple of reviews such as mine. If you do decide to try it out, be sure you're with your dog in case something like this happens."
3,Not effective for my dog.,"My dog is the perfect dog except for his barking at the door habit. Even if it is my son or me, he barks. Even if he sees that it is us, he barks.He is a standard poodle and has a very loud bark, so it is startling at times. I have tried just about everything to get him to be quiet. I don't mind one warning bark, but he won't stop.He would never bite anyone, but he scares them to death with his charging at the door and barking habit.This collar works great as far as mechanically. But it is just not effective with my particular dog. He does smell good though after it sprays. lol"
2,Unpredictable.,Collar sprays dog even when dog is not barking. It is very confusing as he gets randomly blasted in the face with citronella. Collar is easy to refill and simple to use just wish it was more predictable. I ordered the multivet which has better reviews but this is the collar I received.
2,Not effective,"With our neighbors complaining about our dog's barking, we decided to get a bark collar, but were hesitant about a shock collar. The first few times it seemed to be working, and we would come back to a quite, albeit citronella-scented, dog. Unfortunately, he soon figured out that if he kept barking, he could run the amount of spray out, and as it is not painful, he was quite willing to put up with the scent. We soon were getting calls again and had to break down and purchase a shock collar, which has been working. If the collar could hold a lot more citronella, it might have worked, but each time we came home it would be empty."
1,it leaks...,"We bought this product on Amazon. It was exciting for us because it actually worked!... for not even a week and then it started leaking. The spray won't stop just keep coming out slowly even in ""OFF"" position. The worst part is that you can't even return it. I do not recommend this product."
2,Premier Spray Collar,"We heard about the product from our family vet and we didn't want to use a shock collar. I bought this online because it averages $100 on the store shelf. I'm so happy that I only spent $30 because it worked for about the first 2 days and then my dog figured that if he kept on barking, the spray would run out. Our house wreaked of citronella and this just was not a good investment overall. It's too bad too.."
1,"Not a sustainable option, doesn't work","This collar didn't work on our blue heeler mix. It stops him from barking but doesn't have the lasting power to keep up with his repeated attempts. I am having to refill it daily and the cans of citronella are almost $12 and don't last for that many refills. Good in theory, not in practice. I will have to use something longer lasting for my persistent barker."
1,Spray Valve Doesn't Work,"With the switch either off or on, when I fill the reservoir, all of the Citronella solution sprays out through the valve. There is not enough time to get it on the dog. It is totally insensitive to noises. I'd send this puppy back if I thought I could get my money back.Anyone else having similar problems? Any suggestions?"
2,Not very durable.,"I have purchased a total of three of these collar. They seem to work great for a while then they they need the dog to bark louder and more often to get them to activate. Then, after a few months, they quit working altogether. I check the charge and the batteries and that's not the problem. I don't think they are for large outdoor dogs."
3,"just a ""so so""","Worked for about three days. After that, my dog learned the product wouldn't hurt him, and he now barks despite the spraying. It is however, like having a living and moving air freshener, which is rather nice."
4,Good while our dog wears it.,When we let our dog outside he does a soft test bark to see if he gets sprayed. If he does he's quiet the rest of the time if not he starts barking like crazy every time he sees or hears something.This still good for us because I put it on him every morning and every night when I let him out and I don't have to worry about him waking up the neighbors.
5,This worked great ***,"Recently moved into a home with a backyard full of cats, squirrels, deer and any other type of animal.. My dog was used to apartment living so he barked constantly at all his new found friends. This collar was a perfect answer to our prayers. He stopped barking immediately !!!!!! We now don't even turn the collar on and he is as quiet as a church mouse. My dog is a bichon frise..Thank You so much !!!"
4,Premier Spray Sense Anti-Bark Dog Collar,the collars are working great on my three dogs! I feel so much better knowing that I don't have to resort to a much harsher electrical alternative. One of the collars had a small leak in it and Premier sent another brand new one with no questions asked just requested the broken one back (they paid the shipping).
3,It works! Kinda.,"When our doorbell rang, our dog used to go off for five minutes straight--like the devil himself was knocking on our door. We got this collar as a last resort and can say that it definitely has helped with his barking. But it's flawed. It's sprayed him more for doing absolutely nothing than it has for barking. He was next to me on the couch, sleeping silently, and it sprayed him. When he was cuddling with my husband, it sprayed him. When I adjusted the collar, it sprayed him. All of these scenarios (and more) have happened multiple times. So the idea that he only gets sprayed for barking and ""being naughty"" that way is completely lost. Instead, he just mopes around and acts afraid to do anything. In short, yes, it has helped reduce his barking but it has also zapped his will to live!"
5,Unbelievable,Two small dogs barking every time we left home to do errands.Our Vet suggested the Citra spray collar and we tried several.Premier was by far the best. Absolutely no barking after being sprayedonce. Although they stopped working after a short time the customerService Dept sent new ones right away. These things work!!
3,Good while it lasted,"Like some others have said, it worked great until it broke... replaced the batteries, which helped a bit... but overall, it just dribbles out citranella - and my dog is back to bark crazy and waking up baby. Going to order another one... just have to live with a great product that breaks quickly."
1,Useless If It Doesn't Work,Have been using collar for about a month. Was very effective when it worked. No longer works (doesn't spray). Filled as instructed. Checked battery which is ok. But back to the barking dog!Bummer! Question--can I return it without its original packaging?
2,Not working for my dog,"I have a fairly easy dog to train, a standard collie (she looks like Lassie). She trained in 3 days for the invisible fence but barks at trucks, motor cycles, cars, joggers and people walking with dogs. She only barks for a minute but we thought we would try the citronella collar rather than something more harsh. Our veteranarian did recommend it. Unfortunately, it just won't work for her. We are very disappointed. Any suggestions?"
5,Doxie & Maltese bark/howl/yip nipped!,Worked great for my Doxie mix (25lbs) and Maltese (4lbs). Only took a few sprays to make an impression. Now I only have to put the collar on during times they are prone to bark/howl... don't even have to turn it on!
5,This product works on our American Eskimo,"This ""No Bark"" Dog collar has worked really well for us. I'm really happy that they have a safe product that works! We used it during 4th of July and it really calmed my American Eskimo down and he did not try to bark at all! It was truly amazing. One thing we do when we use the collar to help our our dog to understand why we are putting on the collar is that we tell him before we use it. For example, we'll say, ""No Barking"" and put on the collar on and say ""Bark"" when we take it off. This process tends to help him understand what's going on. I would recommend this product to people who are looking for a safe way to calm and help their dogs understand that they don't have to bark at EVERYTHING!!!"
2,Collar would spray when dog wasn't barking,I tried this collar and had to send it back because it sprayed him on numerous occasions as he was sitting quietly. I am going to try it again because I really don't want a shock collar.
4,pretty good,"I like this item, I have really seen an improvment in my dog's barking. However one thing I did not like is the fact that if you leave it on in the house, it squirts citronella all over the house."
2,Doesn't keep my yappy Cairn from barking...,"He just looks away from where the spray emits--and barks again!It also doesn't work 100% of the time...and we're not sure why. When we fill it, it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to, or it isn't working very long.It does work well for my other small dog who is not such a persistent barker. Terriers are just too stubborn to care if they're getting sprayed, I guess."
2,Only sprays intermittently with my cocker spaniel (15 lb.),"Sometimes it sprays when she barks, most of the time it doesn't. So I would say its effectiveness has been rather low. It's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog. I can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine. (My children found this amusing.)"
1,Doesn't spray when dog barks-Amazon won't take back..don't buy,My dog can bark for 1 hour and never once has the spray went off...then when I request return I am told it is not refundable..I would understand if it worked when the dog barked but didn't stop the barking..but it doesnt work at all..this is my 2nd time Amazone has sold me a bad item in 5 months and i GOT THE RUN AROUND...we are done with them because of this.
2,Broke within 1 month of purchase,"Purchased the product in the hopes that it would stop my puppies whining habit. The whining was too high of pitch to be picked up by the microphone, so it did not work for this use.The collar was useful in curbing some barking. It was quick to run out of spray (about 15 puffs per refill), and refilling it involves removing the collar from the dog. The battery also dies very quickly, so do not leave the collar on for a prolonged session.When the first battery died, the collar never worked again. I tried replacing batteries with Premier Spray brand and Radio shack brand. Once replaced, the microphone would not pick up anything less then a loud yell directly into the mic (PS careful when you try this, as its easy to spray yourself in the face, speaking from personal experience here :)"
3,Worked great but didn't stop dog from barking,"The collar itself was great, it worked exactly as it should. But we have a stubborn dog, so even the spraying didn't deter him from barking, we've had to actually upgrade to a shock collar to help his barking.I didn't know this at the time I purchased it, but they actually have a no scent spray you can use instead of the citronella. If you have allergies or small children I would recommend the no scent spray because with his barking and it spraying every time, we were being choked out by the smell.The collar picks up barks wonderfully, we had taken it off of our dog and forgotten to turn it off, and when he was in another room and barked, I heard the collar spray several times. So it works great, but as I said we have a stubborn dog (he liked the taste of the no chew spray for furniture when he was a puppy, so that should tell you how weird he is (-: )"
2,Malfunctioned and can't return,"This collar worked so well, I was such a happy girl! Our dog barks at anything walking by, and often wakes up our baby from her naps. This collar worked amazingly well. For about a month or two. Then it just stopped working, and the dog continued to bark away. I filled it with more citronella, tested it by blowing on the microphone, and it clicks like it's going to release citronella but it never does. Amazon won't take it back because it has pressurized gas, and I don't see any contact information for the manufacturer to see if they'll replace it. Also, the plastic buckle is really flimsy and let's the collar loosen. Bummer that companies can get away with not standing behind their products."
3,Works well for my dogs....when it isn't broken,"I bought two of these collars 1 year ago, one for each of my two dogs. I had immediate success as both dogs hate the aeresol sound and the strong citronella smell. Both collars were used extensively for about 8 months before they each stopped working within a week of each other. There is a lifetime guarantee so I sent one of the collars back and kept one for my more obsessive barker as the collar still worked well on a psychological level. I received the replacement which failed about 5 minutes after I got it. I let Premier pet products know and they immediatly sent out a replacement, which I received last week. The replacement lasted about 1 day before failing. It sounds like they are having some serious issues with their manufacturer in China. Premier has been very responsive to my issues, but the poor reliability of the collars has me wishing there was another company with a more reliable product."
2,Didn't work for me.,"Bought this product to curb some solitary barking, but my girl is a smart one and figured out that if she barked long enough, the spray would run out. I'm disappointed."
1,expensive to maintain,"The premier anti-bark collar worked well at first and is a great idea. However, I found the battery wore down quickly. The batteries it uses are real expensive. The collar still didn't work after I replaced the battery possibly because the expensive battery had sat on the store shelf for too long. I don't feel I can afford to maintain this collar."
1,Not So Great for Hounds or Prolific Barkers,"Definitely not the right product for a hound. We have a Treeing Walker that we adopted from the shelter last year, and he barks A LOT. He barks so much that a neighbor called the Humane Officer and complained. We tried the collar on the recommendations of a friend who had used one with much success and our vet. Copper quickly learned that he could bark through the contents of the collar quickly then he was free to bark to his heart's content - much to the annoyance of everyone around. Also, the first collar we received clogged within a week and had to be returned to the manufacturer. The second collar worked fine for a month, with very frequent refillings, and then clogged just like the first one. I will say this for Premier, they are very responsive to complaints and want to work with you to solve any problems. It's unfortunate that this collar didn't work, but we'll keep searching for another solution."
4,Works for my pugs pretty well!,"I was worried this would hurt my stub nosed pugs, but it almost sounds like screaming when I walk them and they see another dog.They still bark at other dogs a little bit, but these collars have reduced that a TON. The citronella scent does not stay for long, and it does not hurt them at all. I have noticed when the collars come out, the barking stops, even when getting them ready for their walk which is GREAT. They are not 100 percent quiet, but at least I am not dragging them away from other dogs profusely apologizing anymore, and that is enough for me!"
1,Not worth it,This product worked well for about a month. My dog only needed it on a few times. After about the 6th use it kept on spraying even though she had stopped barking which defeated the purpose. It won't keep the citronella charge at all. It keeps spraying out.Not worth the money.
3,"Good Idea, But Not For My Dog","The product was easy to figure out, worked as it was supposed to but did not curb my dog's barking. I had to purchase the electronic shock collar which is working very well.I would still recommend the Gentle Spray collar to try first."
2,"Great, but only until it broke down",This collar worked well for the first couple weeks. The spray did a wonderfull job of cutting off my pit bulls' barking escalation in the mornings as my roomates left for work. But the collar died within two weeks. It was fully charged with spray and I put in a new battery but nothing happens anymore. I expected more for my money than a lousy two weeks. Would not purchase again.
3,It's OK,"I bought this for my dogs to help curb their barking tendencies. In general, it works as described, and did in fact get them to stop barking. However, if one dog is standing too close to another and barks, it will set off the other dog's collar. Also, when my dog shakes his head, it will spray him then as well. We only use this as a last resort of sorts. The dogs just really need to see us pull it out of the drawer, and they start behaving."
2,Effective but replacement batteries are a complete SCAM,The collar works well but the product is designed so that the batteries wear down quickly and it seems whenever I need to use it the batteries are dead. It is an intentional design flaw by the manufacturer to keep you buying their way overpriced batteries.Unless you are superhuman and never distracted and remember to turn the collar off after each use you will lose your mind with frustration.
2,Not for my dog,"I knew this would be hit or miss. Works for some dogs, not for others. My dog has too much fur around his face for this to be effective. Was worth a try"
2,stopped spraying after only 4 days,While it was operative it worked to stop the barking but unfortunately the unit stopped spraying after only 4 days.
2,"TERRIBLE PRODUCT, NOT RETURNABLE","I had hoped this product would work, unfortunately after one ""Spray"" the collar stopped working. I bought new batteries, no luck. However, Amazon was great - because it's not returnable, they just credited my card."
2,Stopped dog from barking but broke in less than a week,This collar worked wonders on my dog. She would bark at anything that moved. I didn't want to use a shock collar so I thought this would be a good alternative. Although the results were better than I expected the collar quit working after just 1 week.
3,Ok product - might work for others,"This product didn't seem to work at all for my 75lb dog. I'm not sure if it just wasn't spraying him in the face correctly or if he really just didn't care. I would say this product might work for others, but did not work for me."
5,Pet safe gentle spray,"This product has proven to be a miracle worker. Neighbors were complaining about my dogs barking and when he was outside and wanted to come in, If I didn't move quickly there would be excessive barking. Now I actually have to check for him to let him in."
1,does not work,"I tired to use it once, and my dog ignored it. The next time I tried to use it, it didn't work, so I am in the process of returning it."
2,Got used to it.,I bought this collar a month ago to help control my dog's bark issues. It worked for a couple of weeks and kept my pug from his manic bark fits. After the shock of the spray wore off my dog just lets the collar spray itself empty during his barking fits. My dog sprayed a lot of guests by barking at them so we will have to resort to shock trainer collars instead.
3,"Works relatively well, I guess","It does help a bit with the barking, but the spray doesn't last long. On top of that, the collar is pretty heavy for smaller dogs, so I'd suggest using it on dogs over 20 lbs only."
1,Three defective and not able to return via Amazon,"I purchased two of these through Amazon. One of the two did not work at all. I was unable to return to Amazon (for safety reasons concerning the butane refill).I paid to send the device to Premier and the manufacturer sent a replacement. After using it a couple of times, the collar would not stop spraying the citronella even after it was turned off!When I then tried the second new one, the device over heated and was hot to the touch where the battery resides. If you do use this product be careful and never leave it on when you are not there to see how it performs."
4,Great product!!,We have a pomeranian who barks non stop and this has quieted him to a resonable point. It is a little heavy around the neck of a small dog but don't seem to hinder him in any way. You just have to be careful not to talk to loud if you are holding the dog because I got a good spray in the face myself!!! I would recommend to anyone.
2,"Worked, now it doesn't","This item worked brilliantly for the first 3 months. Since then it has required two battery changes and several refills. Now it does not work at all. It doesn't spray the citronella at all, whether the dog barks or whether we test it at close range with loud noises. I am convinced it is broken and there doesn't appear to be an recourse here apart from ordering another which I will not do."
2,Not for our Shelties,"Did not work for our stubborn shelties. It sprayed as intended, but I think they like the smell of the citronella because they keep barking. It worked for the first day as it startled them, but not any more. So we still have barking dogs and now have a house that smells of citronella."
2,Almost Useless,"Bought 2 of these since I have 2 dogs that have barking matches. The collar worked immediately on 1 of them... Until the battery died hours later. The other dog just learned how to bark under her breath so that the collar didnt trigger. The batteries in both collars died after 5 hours, and they arent standard or even semi standard sizes. Cant find them anywhere but online. And because its citronella, returning this product isnt an option. Dont bother wasting your money."
1,Did not work for us.,"It worked...at first, but the effects wore off too soon to become effective. That and the collar kept falling off and we would have to search our two acres to find it. Beware, it seems like you cannot return this order because of ""hazardous material."" We are out the cost of this item with seemingly no recourse."
1,Bark collar eats batteries,"Let me start by saying that this review is of the product and not the supplier. I purchased the collar because I liked the idea of using the spray as opposed to the shock type collar.I received the collar and filled it with the spray and tested as outlined in the instructions that were supplied. After turning on the switch and placing it on our dog, it worked as advertised ... for a while. Even though I turned it off, it seemed to go through batteries at an amazing pace (3 in 3 weeks). As tip to those who have more success than I, buy them at Target in the electronics department. Check the cross reference on the Net for the correct battery type as they are not the most common variety. I don't know if my issue is a user issue or if it is inherent in the product.I personally would not buy it again but it was worth the try. As they say ""your results may differ""Premier Spray Sense Anti Bark Collar"
4,Works well and quickly,"It appears that not everyone has had good luck with this product--just take a look at the variety of reviews and ratings. It worked well for us, however, and put a quick end to our new mixed-breed dog's constant barking. The spray is much more humane than a shock, and it is just enough to distract her long enough to stop with the barking. The one thing that we don't care for is that the collar strap is rather poorly made and constantly slips, so has to be continually tightened down. Also, it isn't very easy to find replacement N-sized batteries (I have the same issue with a bike light!). But all-in-all, we're satisfied with the purchase and would recommend this collar to others.***UPDATE: 7/21/2009***Unfortunately, our dog has gotten used to the citronella spray and it no longer stops her from barking. I thought this was going to be the answer to our problems, but we've decided, reluctantly, that we may have to go with an electric bark collar instead."
4,No Barking!,"This product really works. It so nice to let my 2 dogs outside to romp and play for a big part of the day without worrying that the neighbors are going to kill me because of their incessant barking. They used to bark and bark a lot! It's quiet now. And I feel better using a spray device rather than shocking them. It's not painful, just annoying to them."
5,Stopped barking on 1st attempt ...,"After getting units( I have 2 dogs ) and putting in batteries and spray, I put the collars on my dogs and let them outside. Each dogdid their normal bark, but the first and only bark was about 1/4 the duration. Then, no more barking. There has been no barking when their collars are on, period! I don't think I will ever need a refill. One side benefit is that while the dogs are inside without their collars on, barking has subsided about 75%."
1,Quit working after less than two weeks,"This worked great... while it lasted. We tried refilling it and changed the battery but nothing worked. Would like to return and exchange but when I tried, it says that it is ""non-returnable"" because it contains flammable liquids. If I'm wrong and there is a way to get an exchange or refund, someone please let me know!"
1,Didn't work on my stubborn lab!,"I purchased this item through Amazon a few weeks ago and the first few days my lab was responding well to the spray. But that didn't last long! Now he is back to the same routine of barking uncontrollably while getting sprayed 30 or so times in the face. It doesn't phase him! Also, the battery died after only 2 weeks of use and had to replace it! I am now researching the bark shock collar!"
1,broke after 2 days of use.,"while it worked it was effective, but after 2 days the spray nozzle started leaking citronella all over the place. amazon would not accept a return, luckily premier did, hopefully the replacement will work better."
4,A lifesaver!,"What a great product! I have a very vocal Australian Shepherd puppy and was pushed to the brink of insanity by his incessant barking. I consulted a trainer and nothing they recommended worked so they finally told me to get this. I wish I would have gotten it sooner! It has made our relationship so much better! After 3 weeks, the collar malfunctioned and I had to send it in to Premier. They have great customer service and I am now waiting for a replacement collar (free of charge). I didn't realize how great it was until now - when I don't have it. It has been a LONG few days without the collar. If I try to mimic the sound of the citronella being released by the collar, sometimes he will stop barking, but I'm definitely not a good substitute. The other down side is that the battery is not easy to find (at least in my area - I checked 4 stores before I found one at Radio Shack) - I'd buy one online and also an extra can of citronella, because you won't want to be without them for long."
2,Unsure About the Product!!,I receieved the item on Friday and started to use it on my 50lb german shepard on Saturday. It worked by spraying when he barked the first few times and he stop barking but then it malfuncation and continued to spray without him barking. It seems like a might work but I wouldn't waste my money on it again. Maybe get a remote control device better. I called Amazon to complain about the product and it being defective and they said that they no longer carrying the item so they gave me a full refund and it showed up in my credit the next day.
2,Overly Sensitive & Stopped Working,"The first month of this product was great. My only complaint was that the bark sensor was too sensitive (my beagle would sneeze and it would spray). After about a month or so of use, it stopped working altogether. I replaced the battery, refilled the citronella, nothing. I like the idea of the product but there is much room for improvement."
1,Does not even operate,"I bought three collars for my dogs, it turns out only one even worked and that was for a whole two days! I want to return them and Amazon won't even let me do that due to the citronella being hazardous. A complete waste of money and shame on Amazon for not telling you up front to forget trying to return it!"
1,Updated model is awful,"My last bark collar stopped working (the older version). They made a new model (this ASIN) and it's worse than the last one. This new model is way too sensitive and sprays when another dog barks next to my dog. This increased sensitivity causes the collar to keep spraying until its empty (and useless at that point). I can't use the shock bark collar because he already has a shock collar to stay within the yard (would just cause confusion as to why hes getting shocked within my yard) I will have to return this apparently.. I wish they still had the older model of this collar. Looks like I'll have to find the older model at another retailer, it worked great! Don't waste your money on this newer model."
5,It Works,"We have a German Shepherd that gets over excited when there are children running and jumping in and around our swimming pool. When we put the Gentle Spray collar on him, the spray, when he started barking, was enough to distract him and he stopped chasing the kids.Now simply putting the collar on him is enough to settle him. I'm sure that soon only the word collar will do it."
5,The Best!,"A few years ago I bought a shock collar. I didn't like to use it because I thought it was cruel. Since I didn't use it, it didn't work.Someone told me about their experience with the Citronella collar. I bought it and tested it on myself. Not such a horrible experience, so I put it on my dog. Within 2 hours her barking was reduced 99%. I didn't use it for the next 3 days, but I found her barking was still reduced. It has now been a week. She has started barking again (dogs in the window, falling leaves...etc). I put it on her again for about 15 min. and it refreshed her memory. I feel this collar should only be used in short time periods and only while you are there to supervise. The person that recommended this collar said all she has to do it wave the collar in front of her dog and he stops barking. Sounds good to me."
5,crazy dog lady,"I LOVE this product. I purchased two of them to keep my cranky old neighbor from calling the police or animal control on my rescued dogs when we are out enjoying our yard. My pug mix got one poof from the collar and got the message. I put it on him when we go out, but don't turn it on. He doesn't bark! My morkie learned a little more slowly. I use his more indoors when he barks at the TV. I put it on, he gets poofed and then is quiet for the rest of the night. I can actually watch a movie with dogs in it and not have my little guy barking his head off! I highly recommend this collar!"
4,A Gift from God,"It has truly worked wonders for my howl-loving Beagle. No more barking, no more howling, as soon as the collar goes on he instantly calms down.He never tried to ""out bark it"" - a couple of sprays and he knew the drill. I don't even turn it on anymore, but he knows its there and behaves.It has not re-trained his barking behavior and I continue to put it on him when going for walks and when he is home alone. This is fine with me, as I wasn't looking to create a silent dog to begin with, I simply wanted to stop the barking at strangers, other dogs and the incessant howling when I wasn't home. It has worked like a charm.Now in terms of actual quality, it worked beautifully for a couple of months, now I notice that in order for it to spray I have to refill it every day. My guess is that I dropped it a few times and its leaking. I will definitely buy a new one, and i highly recommend it."
2,"Not sensitive enough, didn't trigger when our dog barked","It only actually activated maybe twice, despite days of trying the collar and hundreds of barks. We tried a fresh battery, too. Only when the dog did a really loud, long howl did it activate. The couple times it did, she did stop barking. We may look into getting a remote-controlled spray collar that we can activate. The sensor on this one didn't work for our dog."
1,I can't breath!,"This does not work for our Beagle. He is scared to death to move, He gets sprayed when he isn't even doing anything because any noise sets it off, and I can't breath because there is a horrible ""tasting"" fume that lingers in my house! AND you can't return it."
4,Works like a charm,"I really enjoy using this product. It is harmless to the dog and fun to watch him bark, get sprayed then completely stop the noise. He took a little while to realize that the barking was getting him sprayed but once he did, I only have to put the collar on him and he stops barking. I was very pleasantly surprised at how quickly he learned. The first time he wore it, he was running around smelling like bug spray but now it's just quiet when he has it on. Every now and then he will forget and bark, it's quite funny to watch him realize that he is wearing his collar.Setting it up and putting it on him was very easy. It stays put, if our other (non-barking) dog would leave it alone. The refill bottle is easy to use and you can't overfill it.Works great, good for the price. - I wish it had an auto off as I have forgotten to switch it off a few times but apart from that, highly recommended."
3,Bark Control,This product works better than the ultrasonic devices. It is helping to cut down on my bichon's squealing and barking.
2,Crazy barking dog,My 11 month old lab puppy is crazy about barking. The collar worked until she figured out that if she kept barking it would stop spraying after a little while. No luck with this product. Sorry
1,Oh well...,I was hoping this would help but it didn't. A lot of noises can set off the spray mechanism and eventually my dog became unphased by the citronella. We used it for a couple of weeks and it stopped spraying. Yes we changed the battery...Yes we refilled it with spray...The nozzle makes a hiss like it's clogged and nothing happens. Premier really doesn't have much support through the website so I don't know what to do...
2,Doesn't Faze my Doxie,"2nd day of using this collar and unfortunately, it doesn't seem to faze my 11lb miniature Dachshund, though it is fairly bulky for such a small dog. She adapted to the extra weight of the collar, and doesn't seemed bothered by it at all. I've put it on her for about an hour in the mornings and a couple of hours each night so far. As far as I know the device is working, though I can't smell anything or notice my dog reacting to it at all. For how much she is barking, I expected to smell even a hint of the citronella, but nope. Like I said, it does not distract her from her persistent barking (at ""perceived noises outside, doorbells on TV, anything that sounds like knocking on a door). I will likely return this item."
4,For the price,"it Rocks, maybe I wish it didn't spray for 3 seconds. However it could be do to user error, i.e putting too much juice in the device."
2,Didn't work on my Maltese.,Didn't slow him down any that I could tell but a friend had a better experience. May be that his neck hair blocked the spray somewhat.
1,Bad Collar - Doesn't spray out,http://www.amazon.com/Premier-Spray-Sense-Anti-Collar/dp/B0002D31QU/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_topI must have a bad collar because it does not even spray out half the time the dog barks.I'm not satisfied with the product at all
1,Not for the stubborn at heart,"Unfortunately my dog must be more stubborn then most. She is a spirited West Highland Terrier who feels it is her responsibility to bark if the wind blows...unfortunately the neighbors don't feel the same way! The collar sprays and she literally continues to bark through it, even as it continues to spray again and again. She could care less! Ugggh. I guess I will have to try the shock collar:("
2,This Thing Worked...for awhile,"For about the first month or so, this worked wonders. Our avid barker was blissfully silent, and we were thrilled that we had found a humane way to deal with her nuisance barking! However, she soon realized that she could just bark repeatedly and empty the spray canister, leaving her to bark without consequence. Darn it!"
1,Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar,Previously I reviewed this positively however after using it for several months it no longer was an effective deterrent for barking. My Basset loves to bark and is very loud. I have since bought the a battery bark collar which works fine.
3,Anti-bark collar review,"The collar worked wonderfully for the first two weeks. However, shortly after this period my shiba-inu became desensitized to the citronella spray and just ignored it and kept barking. Our dog may just be too smart or stubborn or something, so it may work better on other breeds. Also, it would be better if they made other scents, so that we could try another scent that he's not used to, and keep varying them."
3,"Good idea, but...","Fist and fore most, re-engineer for small dogs in mind. The product is heavey and bulky for a small dog. I wish it came with out the scented spray, but overall I'm satisfied with the product. Much better alternative to a shock colllar. So far results are mixed, but I think it needs more time. Classic conditioning doesn't happen overnight. For the most part my dog get's it; bark equels spray. I think the site of it is even working. A few more months and I don't think she'll need it anymore."
1,does NOT work,"All this product does is fumigate the house with citrus smell that can get quite irritating. It does NOT however, stop my sheltie from barking."
3,bark collar,"Previous reviews of this product warned me that it only worked well on some dogs. On my Corgi, it annoys him, but only somewhat inhibits him when he wants to bark (which is not all the time, but when he psyched up to go on a walk, etc.). I bought the collar after I talked to a friend who used one on his (as furry as a Corgi) German Shepherd. What silences my dog as well as the collar is shaking a can of pennies at him. Ross Stockwell"
5,it works,this collar really keeps my dog from barking. Also the company has great consumer support. We had a problem with the collar and they immediately honored the life time warrantee and replaced it
3,mixed opinion about spray collar,"The spray collar worked each time the dog barked and did stop him in his tracks. He, a long haired chihuahua who is not the brightest, had no idea however that his barking triggered the spray. After several sprays over a period of time, he hid in the bedroom and wouldn't come out. Although it stopped the barking each time it occurred, there was no long term gain. Without the collar, he still barked. What has worked is being consistent each time he barked to tell him no and then pick him up and distract him. He is barking much less after 2 days of this and it is pretty clear this is what is needed to finally break the habit."
3,Works when it wants to,"This product was just okay. I have an 8lb toy poodle. Sometime it worked on him and sometimes it didn't. couldn't really understand why, he barks the same way every time."
2,Not so great,I got this item thinking it would be so much better than the shock collars but the battery died one day after it came in the mail and it didn't seem to bother my puppy even though he didn't like the smell. He kept yapping away
1,Waste of Money!!,"This was the biggest waste of money! I put this on my dog as soon as it came in. The first time she barked I could tell it sprayed because she started to sniff in the air. So I began to test her in the house by knocking on doors and such. She continued the barking so I wanted to make sure the thing was working. Sure enough it wasn't spraying. After replacing the battery, I tried it again and it didn't phase her one bit. The spray is just a fine mist. Even when I tested it like they tell you to do it was so fine that I could hardly smell it. I even adjusted the collar several times to make sure I had it on correctly thinking that would make a difference but it didn't. So if you're looking for something to help control your dog's excessive barking, look somewhere else. This is useless!"
3,Could be better,"While the spray collar DID curtail barking at first, my dog got accustomed to it very quickly. I will not buy another nor the spray refill."
2,"Great concept, but the quality needs improvement",I love this spray collar when it is working. The collars usually work for about a month and then the spray starts leaking out when you refill the spray device. Or the spray device just doesn't spray at all. The customer service is great for returns but I have to pay to ship the spray device back to them. I have done this several times and I finally gave up when both collars broke for the third time.One other thing. They need to make rechargeable batteries for this collar. It is not economical or environmentally sound to have to buy new batteries all of the time.
3,Good for a few months only,"The Anti-bark collar arrived just in time to test out with arriving dinner guests. One bark and that was it! The spray was not overpowering; it just caused our dog to look surprised, run out of the room, and then act like a good, quiet dog. It has also worked when seeing his least favorite dog across the road (no more rabid barking during walks), and also when the mailman arrives. He does not wear it all the time, but when he does, he either doesn't bark, or just barks once.I wouldn't recommend this collar for very small dogs (ours is 40 lbs and it is a good size for him); perhaps there is a smaller model available?Unfortunately, four months later, the sprayer no longer works. We replaced the battery about a month ago, so that is not the problem. There is clearly plenty of fluid left in the refill container too. Drat!"
1,It sprays with no reason!,I bought this product for my dog who is barking at my neighbor. Put it on for the first time this morning. I was with my dog outside and suddenly with no reason he was sprayed. Which scared him. And an other time he took his Frisbee and was sprayed again. After that he was scared of his Frisbee. :( I can't return the item because I don't still have the packaging :( I don't recommend this item.
2,Didn't Work,"It might just be my dog, but this did not work, my aussie still barked and didn't care that she was getting sprayed. My whole house smelled of citronella...lol and still had a barking dog. Oh well, had to try it!"
2,dies quickly,"The first time we used this on our toy poodle he was very surprised and it worked very well, it shut him up in no time but as soon as the battery died (and it did very quickly) the dog was back to his annoying barking. We bought a few 6v batteries from the store but they didnt work, not sure why. So we needed to order batteries. Im willing to pay almost 7.00 for a battery a week, but the biggest problem is the container that hold the spray is to small, my dog will ignore the spays and in one barking session the container needs filled a g a i n......."
1,Save your money,The spray never would come out when dog barked . Tried all the suggested items suggested in manual. Save your money and try something else.
5,great for Beagles!,"We didn't realized until we picked out our pocket beagle that he is part of the hound family. I was worried the first few days because we live in apartment building. Luckily my aunt told me to try this and buy it off of amazon. It came quickly. We would only put the collar on him at night time and he would have 2-3 whines then bark and the collar would spray and then he understood and would lay down and fall asleep. It worked so nice!After only a few weeks I notice it stopped working, we bought new batteries filled it up again, tried everything. I saw a review on here that says to call the company and they will ship you a new one and send a package to ship the broken one back all for free! They even included a refill can and extra battery. This is a life-time warranty! I'm sold on this product and company!The only down fall is I wish they had a size smaller for little dogs, but still works fine."
1,Horrible Product,This broke after the first time using it. Now it just makes a constant hissing noise and will not spray. The few times it did spray it did not deter my dog from barking. Do not buy as it is not returnable.
1,Doesn't work and Amazon does not accept returns,"This product flat didn't work, right out of the box. Amazon won't take it back because it contains a spray container of liquid -- even though Amazon shipped it to me in the first place. Rip-off. Don't waste your money."
1,An Expensive Piece of Junk,"This collar didn't even last 1 day. A good idea in concept, but it is very poorly made. I wrote to MUTTMART Customer Service asking for a replacement, and didn't even get a response. I would recommend against the product and the vendor. A very expensive lesson."
