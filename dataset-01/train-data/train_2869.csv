3,Bad Seed.,"Frankly, this soundtrack confuses me.It shows some shining moments with the Eels, Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Pete Yorn. However, just as you think that you might be okay, comes Lipps Inc horrible rendition of Funkytown, Frou Frou dissapoints with ""holding out for a hero"" and the Jennifer Sauners bonus track almost makes me a little bit sick.But over all, this soundtrack is appealing to many generations. Tolerable, but they've come as close as they can to mixing good and bad."
5,Accidentally in Love is all that matters...,"I'm going to be straightforward. I haven't heard the soundtrack. I'm not going to buy it because if I did, I'd really only be buying one track - ""Accidentally in Love"" by the Counting Crows. I lost my sanity after hearing it about... oh... three times. That was about a week ago. Since then I'd say I've listened to this song about 200 times and maybe 10 or so other songs. It is all consuming. It doesn't matter, the rest of the album could be 50 minutes of Orcas screaming over the sound of nails on a chalkboard, I wouldn't care. This song is all there is. It has made the rest of the music in my life obsolete. Adam Duritz, I am at your mercy."
3,Shrek 2 not as good as Shrek original,I loved the music in original Shrek and thought Shrek 2 would be the same. I ordered the Shrek 2 CD before seeing the movie and was disappointed.
1,Unmemorable soundtrack,"I don't understand why some people like this soundtrack. There's really nothing special about the songs here. Very bland music, just like the film which merely recycles used ideas. A forgettable release."
1,ummmm...not good!,"actually the only song i lyked on this soundtrak was 'i'm holding out 4 a hero' by frou frou. besides th@...not go0d! wast of $$! only good ones r the ones sang by donkey, lyk 'vive la vida loca.'"
4,Amazing,"I love Jennifer Saunder's version of Holding out for a Hero. It was the best song that fit with the movie, adrenline pumping, and exciting.The rest was pretty good too. Not as fun as the first one but great stuff.Counting Crows did a good job with Accidently in Love as well."
5,LOVE this soundtrack,"My daughter LOVES this CD. Every time we get in the car, she asks to listen to it. My favorites are ""Ever Fallen In Love"", ""Little Drop of Poison"" and ""As Lovers Go"". I bought the CD after watching the movie and getting hooked on the songs. I like this one much better than the first movie."
4,Strong Heroines and nasty villains,"A light romance novel with a difference from the more usual romance plots, I enjoyed Notorious Deception. The heroine is well portrayed although how she can forgive her hero for some of his behavour so easily is a bit beyond me! This is a very early book by Basso and hasn't the depth of writing of some of her other works, although she paints a very effective nasty villain!"
1,no charger even when ordering items together,"After reading the review on this item that reported no battery or charger with the purchase of the saw. I purchased the saw advertising of (better together). The photo was of the saw and 2 battery packs. This also did not include the charger. Why would anyone purchase the power tool, Two battery packs and no charger.I DID THE JOKE IS ON ME, ANOTHER $40.00 FOR A CHARGER."
5,Very pretty earrings,"These earrings are not only beautiful, they are very light and comfortable. You barely know you are wearing them."
4,A great 3rd person game.,"With a great blend of action, puzzle solving, and architecture, FAKK2 is one great game. The level design is stunning, control simple and easy to learn. The interface is straight forward and the story is engaging. The game is good, but not perfect. At times I found my self getting stuck on walls or boxes, and the entire game seemed a bit short. With no multi-player the replay value is low. But if your looking for a new ""Tomb Raider"" style game, don't pass this one up."
2,Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2,"I purchased this game in a package. It came with four other games in a set for ten dollars. When I saw that it was in there, I thought, oh, a game with a hot chick, thats a good change. I gladly purchased it and tried it out. To my surprise, the game sucked. At least it wasn't what I was used to playing. I like FPS's and the controls in this rpg/fps didn't cut it. Of course this game is fairly old, thats why it cam in this pack for ten bucks. If you have a computer that isn't up to date, sure I would recommend getting it, but otherwise, don't waste your time. This was just failed attempt to create a game with some extra skin involved. Good idea, needs some work."
3,Good graphics,"This game took a little tweaking to get it to work well. I had problems at first with stuttering video, sound and frame dropouts. I fixed the problem by lowering the sound acceleration one notch using 'dxdiag.exe'. This is somewhat irritating because other software only works with full sound acceleration. About the game itself, the graphics were very good. The method of steering and manipulating the character's movements, I considered awkward. I found most of the puzzles not to difficult but some are extremely frustrating because they require precise timing of movements by the character. Spending hours trying to get through an animation sequence became more of a dread than a entertaining experience. I have not finished the game and probably won't. Any software that makes the user want to slam the keyboard in frustration should be dumped in file 13."
1,Information missing,"I'm missing informations about that book In whitch language is it written ? ""y el caliz de fuego"" seems to be written in Spanish or Portugues ? Don't you have a short overview over this book ? I don't want to by another wrong book It's too expensive to send it back. So I dont by this book"
3,For learning Spanish,"OK, the translation seems a little flat and lacking in the original magic, I'd recommend 'El Hobbit', which is better."
5,A Freaken Awesome reveiw,"Alex Rider ,a 13 year old MI6 agent, goes on a vacation.While on vacation he spots a contract killer ,Yassen Gregorovich.Their is an explosion at his freinds house.The cops assure him it was a gas leak but he knows it was Yassen.He was trying to kill his freinds father, but did not succeed.Even though he is on vacation he goes back to the MI6 to solve the case.I'm not going to give away the ending so you'll have to read it yourself."
4,On the edge of my seat.,"This book was one that I couldn't put down from the second I started reading it. In my opinion it is the best book of the Alex Rider series. It was just action packed, on every page was something new and exciting. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has loved the other Alex Rider novels."
4,Eagle strike,It is a very good book. I am reading the whole series. And I will be getting the next book
4,Horowitz Strikes Again!,"Wow I cant believe that Anthony Horowitz can keep making book after book and still keeps on wowing me. Alex Rider is a 14 year old spy that works for M16. This time Alex is just on a vacation with his girlfriend Sabina Pleasure and there is an attack on Sabina's dad. Later that day Alex finds out the Yassen Gregorovich (The killer of Alex's Uncle) is behind this. Rider decides to try and deal with the problem on his own, but must report to M16 that a famous pop star (Damain Cray) may also have something to do with this. Before Alex can prove to M16 that this attack was from the famous pop star, Alex attends a new video game opening by that exact man! Alex must prove to the world and his girlfriend that this man is evil before it is to late! Will Alex save the world or will the world suffer in the hands of the villain?! Read Eagle Strike by Anthony Horowitz to find out!"
5,Eagle Strike,"Hey this is Jack Harder and I am talking bout the book Eagle Strike is about Alex, a 14 year old spy.Has a big hunch about a huge superstar having big plan to blow up differrent places in the world to destroy them. He is controlling these rocketes from the U.S in the Air force 1 the presedints private plane. I think was a GREAT book for the teenagers."
5,I can only wish i knew Alex Rider..,"In the fourth novel of the Alex Rider series Anthony Horowitz leaves you grasping the edge of your seat, white-knuckled and hungry for words(shocker). In this story I truly began to feel the plot of the series come to light and shoot in different directions. Alex was remarkable (as always) but at the end of the book i felt pity for him. I have always felt that way on some scale, but only then did i feel the empty pity for him. This book was well paced, direct and wonderfully written. The characters emotions are tangible and refreshingly real in this secretive world full of deciet. It is one of the only series of books i have read that end where good prevails, but not everything is cheery and chipper. In this sense, the series only becomes more real to me. I highly recommend this series for anyone in search of a great read. Boys and girls alike will enjoy these novels. Go Alex!"
5,Eagle Strike,"My son (age 12) absolutely loves the Alex Rider series of books by Anthony Horowitz, and has read them all. The action and adventure is so intriguing it keeps him turning the pages. The suspense of the story, and the predicaments Alex finds himself in, as well as, the cool gadgets and skill he uses to get himself out, make the reader put themselves right into the story. The books use great locations and exciting adventures to make the reader want come back for more, as if it were a movie they never want to end. I have enjoying sharing the adventures with my son, and he always looks forward to the next book in the Alex Rider series!"
4,"hmm.. kid running around with gadgets, an assasin, and a mysterious plot...","Lets sum it up= superhero kid+ assasin+ a mysterious plot= a book with a kid secrent agent that has to save the world.i like this book. it has tons of action and is fun to read. unfortunately i've read all of the books in alex rider exept Ark Angel, so i can't remember which one this is, but i know that there all pretty good. try reading this book, then decide whether you want to read the rest of them or not. i don't know if by the time you read this someone else has made a review, but the opinion of one kid isn't enough to decide whether or not to buy this book, but try reading it. You might like it!"
5,eagle strike,"Relaxing in the south of France with Sabina Pleasure and her family , Alex is able to act and do things as a normal teenager would and he doesn't even think of MI6 until someone who Alex does not know who attacked his hosts.This sends him back into the world of decieving and spying.Alex is determind to defeat his hosts enemy and find out why they did it.He knows his enemy is going to be smart when he finds out it is Damian Cray the mastermind behind the new games console Gamelayer which has pain synthesis installed.Damian Cray tries to outwit Alex time after time but the young MI6 spy doesn't give up.It is a great book for suspense and tension."
5,I loved this book,"This book is for anyone who wants or wanted to be a teenage spy (like me). There is action, love, super stars, and super villians all in one book, plus it's very exciting!"
5,For Dedicated Rider Readers...,"At first I didn't get it. At first I wasn't sure. But after poring over this story, I have come to the realization that Alex Rider's father...well, I suppose you will have to see for yourself! In this adventure of the teenage MI6 agent, Alex Rider, Alex is forced, once again, to fight for the survival of the world. This time, however, he can't be sure who is enemy and who is friend. Who is the real fiend that he is supposed to be uncovering this time? Is it Yassen Gregorvich, the Russian mercenary? Is it the man who seems like a dream come true? Or is it someone else, whom Alex hasn't even met yet? Join Alex Rider, fellow readers, as he rises to the world's defense in Eagle Strike."
2,Wouldn't play in Apple PC,"Package arrived on time as a gift, however the person I gave it to could never get it to play. Disc stated it was a European region code."
4,"Witty, entertaining, very Un-Faulkner","An eleven years old boy's journey to Memphis, without parental knowledge, from rural Mississippi with his obstreperous and automobile obsessed cousin, and a related sapient negro house servant turned into the coming of age adventure of a lifetime. Witty and entertaining, this is a very different exposition from the usually dark and dense Faulkner creation."
5,Utterly fascinating,"Sometimes funny, often disturbing, thoroughly unique, and utterly fascinating. A psychoanalyst goes looking for desires to analyze because he lacks any of his own. He settles in a very bizarre and rather brutal village where shame is forbidden, horses are crucified, old folks auctioned, and a woman makes love at long distance with the blacksmith via a robotic spitting image of herself. Very weird, but not in the usual way. It's all presented so matter of factly, with such a straight face, that the effect is unlike any other literature of its kind.""He propelled himself towards some particular piece of debris that was floating on the top and picked it up expertly between his teeth. It was a tiny hand. Covered with inkstains. He climbed back on board again. 'Tut, tut,' he said when he looked at it. 'Old Charlie's boy's been refusing to do his homework again."""
4,Good Introduction to the Movie,"This book is a novelization of the popular movie of the same name. If you've seen the movie, the novelization is a good companion to read. If not, the book is still a good introduction to the basic plot. There are some dialogue differences between the book and the movie, but this is very minor. However, the book does explain many items which, in the movie, were never explained, such as why there are five canopic jars instead of the traditional four.This book is a light, fun read. If you haven't seen The movie, then I recommend that you do. The book provides more of a background, but the movie provides all of the visual action."
1,Possibly the worst films ever made,"This is the very worst collection of short films I've ever seen, and I have dozens of collections since I teach film to high school students. I don't mind amateurish, but these films are, without a single exception, simply bad. They vary from pointless and random to nauseatingly violent without any plot or suspense. The first film on the disc, ""True Love"" is actually cute and worth watching; I would use it as an example of how bad quality sound can ruin an otherwise okay film. The other films on this disc I wouldn't even show to my students as bad examples of what to avoid, because most of them are just unwatchable and/or offensive. Usually when I review a disc, I like to say something nice about it... my reviews as a rule tend to the ""glowing"" side. But I can't find anything good to say about this collection except that it is listed as ""currently unavailable."" That we can all be grateful for."
5,Great macro info,This is a great book for anyone interested in doing field macro photography or even just general field work. Most of the techniques apply to modern photography even though it's an older book. Highly recomended.
4,Scientific Photography,"I found the book informative on how to use various lenses toget high magnification images...Overall, the book is a great referencefor how to inexpensively combine prime lenses to get high magnification images. END"
1,Do not buy this battery,"I ordered 2 of these my Sony T10 because it was cheaper than the Sony brand with a higher capacity. However, as soon as I insert it into the camera, it displays an error message ""For 'InfoLithium' battery only"" and then shuts off. Buy the original sony brand as am going to have to do."
3,a different kind of read,This was an interesting read at times but sometimes I had a difficult time staying with it. I wasn't sure I liked the book for it was often difficult to get into it.
4,Fun adventure in Russian past,"The actors were fun to watch and the story was entertaining. Not a perfect movie, maybe a little rough around the edges, but it is about a... ""sketchy"" time of history anyway. In the end, it was a ""fantastic"" story with some enjoyable movie moments. Reminds me of a Three Musketeers or Man of LaMancha kind of story. Adventurous fantasy based on ""historical events""(?)."
2,Russian Revisionist Der'mo.,"The movie takes artistic licence with real events. Polish troops are thrown back from Moscow. Yet they actually held the city for two years. Poles are depicted as murderous barbarians. Anyone who knows Russian History (not the other reviewers) from Ivan the Terrible to Stalin know otherwise. The only thing they got right was the Polish Winged Hussars were the best cavalry Europe ever produced! If your ignorant of history then you'd like it. Otherwise watch Ogniem i Mieczem for a historical action/adventure movie. Not 1612 trying to encite anti-Polish propoganda to peddle a new ""Soviet"" styled Russian holiday. Unicorns? GMAFB! Biased? Yes. I am Polish American whose ancestors were Winged Hussars and fought in the Polish-Muscovite wars. (der'mo: Russian for crap)"
4,1612?... yes but not quite...,"I found this film very entertaining. However, it is not faithful to history at all and some characters and dialogues are simply not believable. For example, the Spaniard in the story keeps saying ""Andaluces de dinamita"" = ""Andalucians of dynamite"", well, dynamite was invented in 1816 by Alfred Nobel, so it could hardly be mentioned in 1612; the main character evolves from being a slave into a sword master and a skillful blacksmith in a week, and builds a wooden cannon that almost detroyed an entire army.... and so on. There is some magic element floating around, and it would bridge the inconsistencies.On the other hand, the film is rich in portraying some typical Russian characters: the orthodox Hermit, the dangerous country dumb guy, the stupid prince, the overprotective Russian mother, and some others.The film is also very visual and it will be found fun by those who, like me, enjoy epic movies without computer generated images."
2,"I wanted to like this movie,","I watched 1612 yesterday, and I had so much to say. After reading other's negative reviews, I really have nothing to add. However, I was struck by the irony of a russian masquerading as a spaniard who is then inspired by a horse masquerading as a unicorn,"
2,Bad Luck for the Russians and the rest of us,"Had the kabal of Russian boyars failed in their attempt to get the Lithuanian-Polisharmy out of Russia, Russia might have developed into a normal country. Because the boyarswere successful in taking control themselves, Russia isa country which manufactures nothing anybody wants except AK47s (the Chinesemodel is better, and the Albanian version is cheaper). Russia is unfortunately thecontinuation of the Mongol Golden Horde. It lives solelyby stealing other people's territories and vending their raw materials such as oil,gas and timber. Their gold has traditionally been mined by slave labourers and its easternciries, such as Akademgorodok and Novosibirsk, have their mortar mixed with the blood of the Lithuanians,Poles, Estonians, etc., who were worked to death to build them. 1612 was a bad year forRussia specifically, and the human race more generally."
5,Foreign film with a lesson,"The film is in Russian with English Subtitles. The acting is very good and the film is very well played out. I would recommend this film to anybody that appreciates the artistry of film. This is not a high publicity, CGI, big name Hollywood production, this is a film about real humans and the turmoil they faced."
2,Novi V-8 Indy Cars 1941-1965,"Lots of pictures, B/W only! Some good diagrams, but lacking in information to go with them!! Didn't care for the Granatelli interview! If your looking for meat on the subject, this is not it! Should have more on the drivers and Jean Marcenac/Lewis Welch/Radio Gardner!!"
1,HORRIBLE,Ive had the wrong product sent to me twice. its a knock off version it smells like. im very unhappy with this company and product.
4,"A nice, comic-relief show","""The Nagus"" is one of the better Ferengi(a people with an economy centered society)-comedies of DS9. Wallace Shawn as the Grand Nagus is excellent, he manages to steal every scene he's in. The Ferengi-plot is quite good, and has many good lines. For example, ""Is the Nagus here on business, or pleasure?"" ""Is there a difference?"" There is also a suprisingly engaging Jake/Nog subplot, which is carried nicely by the actors. Overall, not a stellar show, but a good comedy, and Ferengi fans will definatley enjoy!"
4,Pretty Good Episode with a few good laughs,This was a pretty good episodes with a few good laughs in it! Quark becomes the Grand Nagus and his own brother (Rom) is trying to kill him. I liked this episode!
3,"All great songs, but...","These are all excellent songs, but the money you spend on this you should be spending on Beginnings, Live at Fillmore East and Eat A Peach. These three discs have most of these songs plus the rest of the albums which are just as essetial."
3,"CLASSIC SONGS, BUT GO FOR ""DECADE OF HITS"" INSTEAD","This CD is one of a series of greatest hits cds that have been released on established acts, including BB King & Lynyrd Skynyrd. As with the others in the series, the song list is rather incomplete. If you are looking for a much better best-of package of the Allman Brothers Band's first classic period, go for ""Decade of Hits"" instead. You will get an additional 5 songs and a better overall picture of their music for just a couple of more dollars.If you are not a greatest hits album collector, but are starting your ABB collection, I would begin with ""Fillmore Concerts"" (2cd enhanced edition of the classic Live at Fillmore East) or ""Eat A Peach"", both from the early 1970s. ""Mycology"" is another excellent ""hits"" compilation that covers much of the ABB's second classic period of the 1990s and is a great value, also."
2,My God this is incomplete...,"Okay, first off whoever said that Stand Back was a better cut then...oh, I dont know, Ain't Wastin' Time No More or One Way Out? Where are Trouble No More, It's Not My Cross to Bear, In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, Hoochie Coochie Man, Ain't Wastin' Time, Little Martha, One Way Out and Statesboro f@$%!#ing blues? Hell, even Wasted Words would be a better pick than Ramblin' Man, for instance!Okay, I'm being a little harsh. It does have Dreams, Whipping Post, Revival, Midnight Rider, Hot 'Lanta and Melissa. But this should be avoided. In fact, I wouldn't recommend any Allmans comp and instead say this: pick up the first four albums (Allman Brothers Band, Idlewild South, At Fillmore East and Eat A Peach)--all the Allmans one really needs, in my mind."
4,Excellent Expose,"This book really engrossed me. I don't know the first thing about skating, and I'm a mediocre runner at best, but I'm an avid armchair traveller, and I loved hearing about what the author went through. It was a nice structure for the book to see her grow up and go from young skater to disillusioned older skater to fulfilled triathelete. Good job! Can't wait to read the next one!"
5,Highly recommend,"As a big fan of figure skating, I ordered this book and was not disappointed. It is well written, funny, candid, and thoroughly enjoyable. Bertine's story is insightful and interesting and certainly drew me in."
4,Growing up in a Dream World,"Kathryn Bertine is an excellent writer. My mom bought me the book because I grew up in the same town and had swimming lessons with Kathryn's mom...this was in the early 1970's, before she was born. We have never met, and I hope to meet her someday. This saga was inspiring and has motivated me to finally get my life-story down on paper. She has given us a clear story of growing up in a world with mixed messages and stressful expectations. She was determined to reach for her goals and unfortunately it was bittersweet in the end."
5,WHEN A DREAM BECOMES A NIGHTMARE,"I really got a lot out of this book -- it mirrors the heartbreakingly disappointing experience I had--working for two years at my ""dream"" job--in Magic Kingdom. I quit a year ago and am still in recovery!!! I enjoyed the writing style of this book, was fascinated by the experiences, and am so glad that there is someone out there who understands what it's like when a dream becomes a nightmare....This is a wonderful and important book that really speaks to a lot of people. I recommend it!"
5,Solid reasoning without violating science...Excellent!,"This is the finest presentation about the reality and possibility of miracles I have ever read. By miracles I do not mean your favorite football team pulling out a victory by a last second pass, or a near miss accident, or a remarkably quick healing of an illness. A real miracle is a violation or suspension of the natural laws of science. Some liberal theologians believe that God would be wrong to do this. Most agnostics and atheists as well as modernists do not believe in miracles at all. The miracles done by Jesus, as documented in the New Testament are often explained away by people with small faith and anti-supernatural agendas. For the rest of the review please visit it at CriticalReviews.com, an AMAZON Associate..."
1,Nothing but Dogma,"The authors commit a very serious fallacy in this book: they assume their own conclusion. They start out by believing that there must be miracles, pick out certain historic events as representative ""miracles"", and then go on to explain why they must have been miraculous. This is a waste of time with which no serious and rational person should bother."
5,music that puts a dance in your step,"I first heard this cd when I was at an art exhibit and I found that I was dancing. When I asked about the cd, I was told that it was David Osborn's Tribute to Frank Sinatra. I can not listen to it without wanting to dance. I ordered it and recieved it promptly and have enjoyed it ever since."
5,Ordering 3 books,I love this old book and ordered 3 to give to friends and family. The content is inspiring and the story is heartwarming.
4,Not Half-baked,"This is a charming little book one can read in a day and then keep as a treasure for years. It's part of a trilogy with ""Jacob's Journey"" and ""Jacob's Ladder."" Great to lend or to refer to for the wisdom and inspiration it contains. There are some interesting quotes, yet I find myself paraphrasing the book's wisdom more than quoting it."
5,Beautiful story !!,"This is a small-beautiful book. Full of profound aspects of life. The Jewish baker tell his stories and answer the questions form the people passed by.Noah Ben Shea is a thinker who knows how to use the word and combine them back smoothly. The book splits into many small sesstions and leave the space for the reader to think along.I would say this is a kind of simplified-philosophy book. But it ain't heavy at all. In contrast, it's ready for reader to digest."
2,Too little for the price,"I was disappointed that the Baby Alive doll came with so few diapers but cost so much. My daughter could play with it for about an hour until we ran out of accessories and the doll was put on the shelf. I've since bought preemie diapers, but you'd think that since the whole idea of the doll is the eating and pooping, it would come with more to handle the fun."
3,be ready to cough out more $$$,"I purchased this for my daughter for christmas.My only problem w/ it , is the cost of the food packages. 6 or $6And you have to buy because anything else would get stuck.Daughter goes through that in 1 day!Diapers are also average $1 each! I just brought premie diapers- same thing.Just be ready to pay alot of extra money."
5,Tey is a Hot New Star.,"Tey has a soft, gentle voice which is both coy and fanfiful. Take Me High has a beautiful lilt. I look forward to her next project."
5,Suzuki top,It looks great and fit awesome . All my friends loved it also.I've got best top on my jeep also. They are great tops..
2,cheap,I gues you pay for what you get. Had it flying for less than a week and it ripped right out of the brass grommets. Will buy better quality in the futre
1,Do not buy this game,This was the first game i bought and unless you are a teen genius only adults know the answer.
1,NOT STABLE & FLIMSY ; HEALTH HAZARD .,THIS ITEM IS NOT MADE VERY WELL ; AS YOU USE IT IT STICKS WAY TOO MUCH AND DOES NOT HAVE A VERY GOOD SAFETY CATCH : IT ALSO WOBBLES EXTENSIVELY : THANKS JOE LARA ; WAITING ON REFUND AS ACKNOWLEDGED IN MY E-MAIL FROM AMAZON.COM :
1,physician,"bought this product for home workout put it together, and the parts dont fit, the workmanship is garbage, and it does not slide up and down, which is critical in a leg press machineIn short, a piece of crap"
3,Not essential,"Steve's third solo album is a mixed bag. Each song alternates between light pop melodies, atmospheric synths and aggressive guitar rave-ups and there is no cohesion here. Nevertheless, there is some good material, especially the pop-oriented tunes ""Hello dawn"" and ""Wait one moment"". But the rest of the album sounds uneven and distorted. Casual fans would do better with purchasing the funky ""Open"", the dreamy ""Green"" or his later-era work with System 7."
5,AWESOME,"This is just waht I wnated!! Mr. Taylor's voice is just right--not too dramatic, but not too flat..easy to listen to."
4,Not as good as the James Earl Jones one,"I liked everything else about it, but the audio quality is poor. I have to turn my stereo up 3/4 of the way to hear it good."
3,Digitally enhanced my foot!,"Disappointing. The voice of the woman giving the introduction was as clear as a bell. But the recording of the gentleman reading scripture sounded older, low & muffled. If this is digitally enhanced, what must it have sounded like before?! I turned my cd sound volume up as high as possible and still had to strain to hear it 10 feet away. (The result was the same on my pc so I know the problem is w/ the recording not the cd player.) The scripture also was read too fast. Although I only want scripture read aloud, I'm thinking of returning this & getting the dramatized bible instead."
2,Audio that you can't hear,I just bought this product from a store and will return it tomorrow. You can't hear the audio unless the volume is on full. I have little children so it is impossible to turn it up anymore to hear over their play so this version is just not usable. How do you make a audio product without the quality of regular cds? Too bad.
5,Treasure for the blind,"This Audio Bible is a steal at fifty dollars, conatining 60 CDs well and conveniently packed in a sturdy case of good quality.The reader's voice is pleasant and calm, without dramatization or personal hysterics.As for content, I have only read 4 CDs as yet. The Bible begins with wild mythic fantasies, but quickly settles down to some superb narrative and very realistic character drawing. One can't avoid thinking that Jacob and his family, Joseph and his brothers erc. are drawn from life. As with any ancient text which still lives in our culture, this has much we must learn and much we must leave behind."
2,"arrogant, conceited, and condescending","The author may be knowledgeable about the topics in this book, but the text at times comes across as arrogant, conceited, and condescending. An example from the bottom of page 23: ""But the Chinese way of `fuzzy' or ethnocentric thinking should not be regarded as a deficiency or handicap that makes it possible for people to take advantage of them. Their successes in the various sciences are proof of their ability to think and behave logically when they are free to do so."" Needless to say I didn't read the next page or the rest of the book. However, I'm glad that I'm not the first reader to have this impression of this book."
5,The Chinese have a word for it,"Timely response, product was received and was as advertised. Would deAL WITH THIS VENDOR AGAIN. :-)"
1,dont buy,it came almost next day but did not work at all i ended up having to buy a chrger from cingular for $25 it was rediculous!!!
4,good but with problems,"If you like British 60's girl group sounds, then this is lightweight but pretty good stuff however there is a problem. The first two tracks have been remastered out of phase. Using headphones, it sounds all right but over a stereo speaker system, this causes the lead vocal to virtually disappear. If you can phase invert your system then you can properly hear the first two tracks, otherwise they are a loss."
1,A great book if you want to be confused,"The book has much information, but it is not in a very logical format. When you need an equation to use a look up chart, don't expect to find one. The charts in the book are useful, but you really have to know what is going on ahead of time, not a good book to learn from. Using this book as a reference book when taking a test is not a good idea. I wish these people would have put at least the odd answers in the back of the book. With out the answers, especially when your teacher doesn't go over hw with you, you have no clue how to do the problems."
3,Not The Best,They're okay... but not the best tasting. They're just a blended paste of all the ingredients. I prefer the ThinkOrganic Chocolate Coconut which have a much better consistency and taste.
1,Scotland...?,"This is so bad it does not even rate one star. It is so bad it does not rate a review. I am only writing this to warn everyone who loves things Scottish to avoid this garbage like the plague. I saw this album on another web site and it was described as traditional Scottish songs played in a rock style. Not so. This is LOUNGE. Devoid of passion, devoid of heart. This is shameful! Tepid lounge jazz should be banned and anyone daring to subject the proud, heartfelt music of the Scottish people to such degradation deserves to be exiled to the dingiest and most tacky of casinos! Did I mention how bad this album is?"
5,Hot Fotos,I loved this book--heard about it from artist friends in NYC. It's got terrific visuals--the stuff the author found is really unique and HOT. Really enjoyed the writing too--a lot of fun. Not all that boring theory you get from the campus types. This is a great gift book--I already got it for my cousin's birthday in Mexico. Plus it has nifty design so is like a coffee table book you can leave out when people visit. Wish all books on sex were like that--sort of classy with lots to look at.
1,Don't Bother!,"This is a garbled, confused assessment of sex in New York City. Its awe-struck yet condescending faux-poetic descriptions say more about the author's inflated sense of self than the topic about which she writes. It's some of the worst writing I've ever come across."
4,Nice and simple,"The rack and the 30 clamps arived without a scratch. Assembly is easy.However, I would make one modification. Instead of installing the cross supports in an X configuration (across the bottom) as suggested in the instructions, cut them down and use them on the outside, between the two frame halves (like a ladder crosspiece). You will need four extra bolts. The advantage, though, is that you could release one side of each brace and fold the unit up to store it against a wall. Some adjustments to the placement of the clamp hanging rods may be necessary to allow the fold, but that flexibility is already built in with the use of hairpin clips to secure the rods.Can't wait to take it to the shop and hang up all my other clamps (plenty of room to spare)."
4,Clamp Rack,The rack is fantastic except for one thing. It stores plenty of clamps on one side but the back side is wasted. It should have the same storage capicity on the back as on the front there fore doubleing it's capacity.
1,Bessey rack,"Nice rack And I would agree with one of the reviews about the wasted back space. I took a 5/16"" drill bit and drilled holes throught the back bars and slid in 5/16"" steel rod which doubled the use and didn't effect the rolling action."
3,Bible commentary,Not the best commentary book. I did not enjoy the way the Author wrote. I just wanted a Bible commentary that can explain the Bible verses to me and not write about other things which I found unnecessary.
3,Interesting writing,I like his style of writing. More interesting than most. Watch out. Learn to differentiate between his opinion and what the Bible actually says. Keep the Bible near to your reading space.
5,Excellent Commentary,"I'm not only learning and enjoying this Bible Volume Set, but have purchased copies for family members as well. I highly recommend it, it is an excellent learningstudy tool."
5,Thru the Bible 1-5 (5 Volume Set),"This set of books are some of the best ever written. My husband, pastor for over 30 years has used them for about that long, son in law asked for a set 2 years ago and the 2nd son in law also asked for a set. The books are full of information, education, and a path to wisdom."
5,Easy to Understand Commentary,"When reading McGee's commentary, one gather's the impression that you are in a conversation with the author about a Bible passage. As if you walked up to a pastor and said, ""I don't understand. Can you explain this to me.?""McGee's side of the explanation is to communicate a simple picture of what is important about the passage. He explains the historical aspects and the players involved. He explains what God is communicating and why it is important. And he illustrates what we, as students of God's Holy Word, should learn from the passage.Many Bible commentaries are intimidating. They use scholarly terminology which can be above the reader's head. McGee's brilliance is the simplicity of the language so that anyone can better understand God's truth."
5,"Earth and Fire-""Reality Fills Fantansy""","I agree with the previous writers-here in the US most people have never heard of this group-what a loss. If you start talking about E&F, they think you are mistaken, that you want to talk about Earth Wind & Fire. I used to own this album in 1981, in Africa. I lost it and have never been able to locate it.I credit my interest in music, music appreciation skills and openmindedness to this group. Today I stumbled upon their website-www.earth-and-fire.nl/english/albums.htm.Unfortunately the site was not responding well. But at least now I have hope of finding it. My favorite piece was ""Season of the Falling Leaves"". I should also say that I was only 19 when I got the album and it was the only one I ever listened to. But listening to all the reviews on this site, I am certainly collecting all the rest."
3,Nothing like the shrade I use to know,"This knife is OK, the handle feels too thin. I can tell it does not have the american made quality, but it does not have he american made price"
5,SCHRADE 3 INCH LOCKBACK,"THIS IS THE THIRD SCHRADE BROWN BEAR LOCKBACK THAT I HAVE HAD OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS. I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS ONE BUT I LOST MY LAST ONE. I LIKE THE SIZE FOR CARRYING IN MY POCKET. IT IS HIGH QUALITY, VERY RUGGED AND KEEPS A FAIRLY SHARP EDGE."
3,Schrade Brown Bear Knife,"Unfortunately, the quality of ""Made in China"" Schrade knives isn't even near that of the original. I lost my Schrade Brown Bear that I carried for more than 15 years. It was a replacement that I had for my original Schrade that I had another 10 years that I had to return because the locking mechanism broke. The ""China"" knife has rough edges where the ends meet the wooden center part. Also, the blade even looks cheap. I'm almost afraid to use it for anything except opening envelopes. I guess ""you get what you pay for."" It was $13.00 +."
2,Returned both Knives,"I bought two of these lb3 knives to give as gifts to my grandsons.??? The knives I received was very lacking in quality.The wood handle inserts did not fit leaving metal edges showing, and felt too. The rivits were not smooth with the wood handles.One knife had to much blade side play ,and both knives were very hard to open and had a ratcheting feel.The metal edges on the knives was not smoothed and felt sharp.I felt they were very lacking in workmanship .I returned them with exc. service from amazon but would not buy this knife again.If you buy this mdl. I hope the quality is better than the ones I returned. I will say that they are a very pretty little knife and my grandsons would have liked them .I will look for something else though."
1,Indian Shakers: A Messianic Cult of the Pacific Northwest,"I didn't like this book at all. I read it many years ago and thought this might be a better version of the Shaker Church but found it to be just a reprint of the old one. It does omit some of anti-racist versions and misinterpretations of the old, but does not depict Native American religion as it exists, still today."
1,Uncomfortable,"Arrived in a timely fashion. However, the plastic that fits around the wrist is hard and very uncomfortable. I finally removed it and put in my own velcro wrist band."
1,Tasteless,"Honestly.............I used to buy this frequently before they stopped caring it in my grocery store. So I was actually quite excited to see its availibility online! I'm not exactly sure what's up with it, but it has absolutely NO taste whatsoever......very big disappointment :o("
5,A brilliant portrait of Republican Lee Atwater,"""Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story"" is a fascinating documentary that chronicles the political life of Republican consultant, Lee Atwater. It isn't your average political documentary, because it also goes into Atwater's more personal life, like his interest in Blues music, and the fact that he was in a Blues band for a few years during his career. The film also delves deep into the corruption and scandal that occurred as a result of Atwater's consulting and campaigns.All in all, it's an entertaining documentary about a very complex political figure. It's filled with scandal, corruption, some music, and the sad end to Atwater's life, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in watching a great film about an interesting politician."
4,Great review of a political operator,"This movie is a great review of a life lived by one of the biggest operators in the last 30 years. It shows what he did to get ahead in the political world and what is cost him as an individual. Watching the movie, you will see what career paths can get you to the inside, but what you need to keep in mind is the cost of those decisions. That is what this movie highlights, and as a result, makes it such a good movie for anyone to watch. My only complaint is that the directors go out of their way at times to highlight the problems with what he did as an individual."
2,again?,"I don't know - I get tired of documentaries that attempt to insert too many invented narratives like this one does. It reminds me of several documentaries supposedly about Reagan where the premise is: ""why did people like him so much whereas the documentarian didn't"". Then again, I wonder sometimes why the "" artistic crowd"" is so relentlesly drawn to portray the politicians like Stalin, Marx, Castro, Chavev, etc, in a positive light, when those people would jail or kill them for any misstep, whereas those they always rally against are their strongest allies in freedom of expression. It is bewildering to me."
4,"Great cd, but...","I don't get the title and how it fits with the songs. Summer Vibes to me would be non-stop dance, and this cd to me has certain songs that are tribal and low key. I am not saying the songs aren't good, b/c this is a well thought out compilation. However, for a ""summer"" cd I would expect non-stop pick me-up dance songs. I like the fact that this cd has old and new as the other reviewer mentioned. Too many times artists feel the need to include only new songs and this takes away the quality."
1,A complete let down!,"I bought this album after reading a rave review in Newsweek magazine. I was thoroughly dissapointed. Mr. Lynne goes from trying too hard to not trying enough at several points, and the lyrics are poorly executed and cliche ridden. Ultimatley, I felt like I was listening to a demo tape."
1,VHS is not what I wanted,Wanted a DVD not VHS format. My fault I guess but can't play VHS anymore and can't send it back for a refund because it would double the cost. Not worth the trouble. I am quite sure the content is excellent.
3,Decent for the hardcore fans.,"This DVD is a long-awaited video release from this band. There aren't any music videos on it because of label issues, but the footage is alright for what it is. There is some cool interview footage with Evan on here. If you're expecting some HD-Quality footage, you better not buy this. It was recorded with 3 camcorders, so the quality is near bootleg. The footage is actually from 1997/1998 because it was filmed before New World Disorder was released. The sound isn't the greatest either, but I love all Biohazard, even the later stuff. The quality of the audio is slightly muddy but it is from the soundboard, so it's not completely crappy. If you're a hardcore fan then this is for you, but if you are looking for a quality live DVD then steer clear."
1,horrible horrible horrible,"Sound quality on the answering machine is so poor that you can't understand what's being said when people leave a message. User interface is terrible -- the buttons don't respond properly, so you end up dialing the wrong number frequently; if you don't enter information fast enough, it times out and clears the display before you save or dial; if you wait too long after a message to hit the delete button, the phone deletes everything in the mailbox... I HATE these phones and the answering machine!"
3,Best For First Time Dog Owners,"A good source of info about the Cavalier origins and nuances of the breed but the general information will not enlighten those who either have dogs now, no matter what the breed, or have previously owned a dog. Lots of the information in this book is common sense. A nice book but not for the experienced owner."
5,Great Book,Great book to have before purchasing this breed of dog. There are alot of things people need to know before finding a breeder for Cavalier King Charles.
2,Is this trance?,"You know, my idea of trance may be flawed, but I really don't think a great deal of this stuff is trance music. Trance is, from what I understand, music that's designed to put a person into a relaxed trance using soothing, repetitive, musically sound noises, that are particularly synthesized. I've lived on both sides of the Atlantic, and the definition of trance didn't change either way. What I'm picking up here is house. It may be somewhat progressive house, but it's still designed for a club, and I've never relaxed at a club.That's not to say I didn't like it. The music on here is surprisingly melodic. I liked ""Come into my dream"" quite a bit...""Boys of Summer"" was OK but I think that song's been remade about every possible way it can be, and I'm getting sick of it.If you're looking for looking for pure true-to-life trance, this isn't your CD. But if you've got an open mind and like club as well, you probably wouldn't regret buying this."
3,Tranz,This cd is off the chain man! I love the music and hope to hear more from those guys. If you love dance tranz you will love this !
4,I like it,I really like this CD. Good songs. A few fiffy spots in the mixing and I agree with one of the other reviewers about The Way. The other version would have been better. But I have most of the Party series and I like them all.
3,Monchy y Alexandra- En vivo,"DVD es muy entretenido y contiene sus mejores exitos, pero quizas esperaba un poquito mas en el show.Aun asi lo disfrute."
4,hook,"This product is very good and it looks great on a white ceiling, I like this product, but i think it is going to be difficult to remove when I move out of my apt."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,"I have Leslie's 2-mile and 3-mile Walks Away the Pounds DVDs. She uses the blue weighted balls. These are excellent workouts. I was extremely disappointed with her new one. First, it has a very 1980's ""aerobics"" feel to it. Leslie works out in a studio ""home."" She does NOT use weights. The music sounds like elevator variety and the ""work out"" is very light. Leslie employs old aerobics moves instead of her marching steps from the 2-mile and 3-mile walk. Also, she doesn't work out with the old gang from her studio that I enjoyed watching. Some the workouts are alone, and others are with a few other new people. I think Leslie should stick with the other format...that's what I was expecting. If you were expecting the same, then pass this one by. If you like cheesy, light workouts 1980s style...you can have mine."
2,Not a solid consistent workout,It starts out SO SLOW - and the production quality is poor. I did 25 minutes and was so bored that I had to turn it off. I am used to the pace of the 2 mile and 1-2-3 Super Fat Burner. This one is not good and would be a waste of money and time if you are used to the other tapes and/or just beyond a beginner level.
2,You too can make a video!,"That's what this tape proves. They didn't break the bank to make this one. What a lame set. And you'll need a warm-up from another video, because there is inadequate stretch of the leg muscles, especially calves.The pace is much faster than it needs to be. The second segment is comical. The tape looks like it's on fast forward. She can't speak fast enough to describe the next routine. She actually says that the second segment has to move fast to get in the distance. Were they running out of tape?!And talk about boring.So, if you don't care about quality of production or sets, you can't stand learning any interesting steps, and you don't mind running around like a rabbit, this tape's for you!"
2,a disappointment from Leslie Sansone,"I've bought her 2-mile walk and loved it and decided to try this video. The production values are very, very low in this video. It looks like it was made in someone's basement. The camera angles are terrible; she'll tell you to move your arms, and you don't know what she's talking about since the camera is on a close-up of her legs.The exercises themselves are boring and I found the first segment incredibly easy, although I am a beginning exerciser. The second and third segments are at a better pace.If you want a walk video, buy Sansones' '2-Mile Walk' instead!!"
2,Awkward; my least favorite,"I love Leslie's walk aerobics, but this is, without a doubt, my least favorite. Many of the moves are awkward to execute, such as the shuffle, box step, and putter. In addition, the camera work is more amateurish than I would expect, given the quality of her other videos. Just as she's adding an arm movement, the camera is focusing on everyone's feet, so you have to guess what it is until it swings back up. Also, she gives you much less warning than in her other walk videos about her next movement. I found this especially true with kickbacks -- the minute the word ""kickback"" is out of her mouth, she's already doing one!I highly recommend the ""abs"" workouts, or the three-mile Power Walk. I'll have to try the other 4-mile workout because I don't think I'll be doing this one again."
3,This is NOT one of my favorites--3 stars is a stretch!,"I love Leslie Sansone--she is the reason I am motivated to lose weight. I got off the couch and started exercising with her 2 MILE workout--was doing it twice a day, and slimming down like mad. I moved my way up to 3 miles twice a day and the 3 mile deserves 5 stars--just excellent!! I purchased the 4 mile Weight Loss Walk and was VERY disappointed, I wonder if this was made prior to making the 3 mile workout tape. I shelved this one and bought the 4 mile POWER WALK which would have been 5 stars if it had NOT been for Florine Mark (a total bore). Try the 4 mile POWER WALK instead!!"
4,Grainy!!! but good,"I enjoy Leslie Sansone.. She has helped me( an overweight exerciser) begin to workout again. I purchased this video some time ago and I had not used it. On New Years Day I got up and I put my 3-mile power walk(all time favorite) on then I decided I would try this video. I managed to do this and her 1mile from her walk away the pounds collection Making it a total of a 8 mile walk in 2 hours. I am using Leslie to work up to the firm..This video is cheesy and grainy but if you don't want ""high-impact"" and you just want to work out, then this is good. Leslie talks all through it too,but I don't mind. I have a health goal and she is helping me reach it."
1,Buy a different one from Leslie,"I've been doing tapes by Leslie, Kathy Smith and Gilad for many years. This is an awful video compared to Leslie's other ones. It was made in 1992, yet the package says ""redesigned"" in 2001. It's almost like it was rejected in 1992, and then they decided to make some money in 2001. She refers to her own feet (left, right) not the viewer's feet. She often changes her feet around by tapping one an extra tap, for no reason - impossible to guess when she's going to do that. Buy the one mile or the two or three, but not this remake. It's her worst. Her other tapes are so much better and easier to follow."
5,Helped me lose,"Yeah, the movements get kind of repetitive. But, I think the 4 mile from 1993 is one of the best. Using the fitness goal chart she gives for miles to walk per week, plus doing additional workouts of your own on the side does wonders. I lost 20 lbs. in two months, until I had a surgery on my arm. I couldn't have felt much better. I was eating healthier too, so this helped also. Key is consistency, and do more than required. I lost a total of 45 lbs. in four months all together doing her video and other physical activity. Somehow I lost the video when moving home from college. I found it recently, and it is going to be put in effect immediately:)"
5,"Excercise, Excercise","This is a great video. It has 4 different walks, starting at one mile and going to four miles. I love Leslie and her videos."
3,The long and the short of it - The more or less music,"It's ok. I did not know th artist and made a tentative, So, What a kind osf singer and player is Guitar Shorty? We had a good surpriswes with him. We don't like of all music, but it's a good alternative to hear it."
3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""YOU CAN'T ALWAYS BE YOUR BEST!"" ""SOMETIMES THAT'S A TALL ORDER!""","As Shaq, ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"", has said in previous reviews: Shorty's got the soul and desire of a blues man, but (No pun intended.) comes up short. Though, this is a ""Best Of"" CD, Shaq likes a previously reviewed (By Shaq.) CD ""Watch Your Back"" better. The long and short of it is, that Shorty just doesn't have the ""full voice"". A couple of songs on this collection, sounds like he's hoarse and yelling, with no singing involved. I made it through the entire CD a couple of times, but there are too many songs, that you just don't want to hear, a second time, let alone a 3rd or 4th time. I feel if Shorty picked his songs better, and maybe emphasized, more strong, lengthy, guitar riffs, he'd have a better-rated CD. Please keep trying Shorty, because your heart's in the right place."
1,Problem (not) Solved,"Very good content. Very Bad Design. What worries me is the Ernest Bettler ""issue"" (pag. 202; 2002Ed.), it makes me wonder how well researched is this book (Problem). So one has to make a an extra effort to re-research it's content. But then again, any one with the desire to learn more will do that anyway (Solved)."
5,Understanding not shame,In this book Callister does a very thorough job of explaining the atonement. It is infinite in scope and depth. By reading this book I feel like my comprehension of the atonement grew beyond anything I expected. I have read books about repentance that left me feeling cold and shamed for being imperfect. Not so with this book.
5,Infinte atonement,This is a wonderful book concerning the atonement of Jesus Christ.There were many times I had to put the book down because I was overwhelmed with emotion.HE is our Savior and redeemer.adiosnstforever
3,"Yes, they are Christians","This is my first foray into LDS literature and I am not familiar with the Book of Mormon. I read it as a Catholic priest. I was drawn to the book by its title, wondering what Mormons might mean by ""atonement."" Upon opening the book I was a reassured that Mormons are Christians. I wonder if that isn't the subtext of the whole project. The first several chapters go on to celebrate the importance of ""atonement"" before finally surrendering a definition of the word.Halfway through the book, I have yet to find much connection between this theological treatise and the philosophical or spiritual thought of latter day Americans. The treatise is a closed loop. If you already agree with its premises and understand its teaching, you will be convinced. If you're looking for an apologia, an explanation of Mormon faith in contemporary terms, it's not here. Or I've yet to find it."
5,Creat buy!,"Product is very good for all mortgage needs, easy to use basic functions and has little pocket build in with user guide if you need more advanced calculation with easy step by step guide. long last battery and protective cover. I lost couple of them but every time buy this one again )"
4,Nice,"Nice calculator, did what I needed for the class I was in. I still have it, so can definetely pass on to someone else"
1,Didn't receive the product,I ordered the calculator but it was never delivered. I was then sent a revised bill for a return charge from Amazon. I challenged the charge and was given a full refund. I do not have the calculator.
2,"So, What Happened to Shannon?","Title sounded like a good book for our AAUW book group - a woman facing an all-male educational establishment in the conservative South. A great deal of Southern/Charleston history thrown in - interesting, but besides establishing what most students of history already knew, had little to do with Ms. Faulkner's story. Never got to know her as a person, and court dialogue not included at all in this book. Where were the taunts, controversy, the meat of the trial? Was Ms. Faulkner suffering from heat exhaustion (and if so, why was she so physically out of shape, given she'd had 3+ yrs. to prepare for Hell Week), or was it an emotional breakdown/letdown after all those years of fighting?Manegold writes like a journalist, giving facts, but little insight to the feature character's final days at the Citadel. Most disappointing! I will not recommend this to my book group."
3,Two sides of the South,"I found the history of the Citadel very interesting, but the story of Shannon Faulkner ultimately disappointing. To surrender to threats after all she had been through to become a cadet didn't seem in character with the stubborn, proud, and gutsy Shannon we saw in most of the book. Of course, I couldn't understand why she would want to go there in the first place. The atmosphere at the Citadel doesn't seem one to produce the new kind of leaders we need for present day situations, and I wondered how the ""knobs"" ever got any academic work accomplished."
1,Politically Correct Baloney,"This book is pure fiction. As a graduate of The Citadel, I found the outlandish statements offensive due to their dishonesty. This author is obviously on a mission to destroy Western Civilisation and lies to do so. There are so many factual errors about simple things that there is no reason to believe or trust this author on anything."
1,In Glory's Shadow?,"I will not quibble over details (I was there as a Cadet during the period)I point out that The Citadel could not possibbly be as bad as Ms. Manegold would have readers believe and still produce generations of alumni who have served their country and communities with distinction. The is no better testimony to the worthiness of the Citadel than the record of alumni who, for five generations, have learned about honor, duty and service to others through the Citadel experience. The title is appropriate for the author for she will always be In Glory's Shadow, one who does not know victory or defeat because she is afraid to enter the arena herself. The Citadel and yes even Shannon Faulkner deserve a better representation. DO NOT BUY!"
4,pleased,"Good movie, brings back old memories when they were on TV. Good wholesome entertainment. We have bought all the volumes."
2,Buying Cray from the discount bins now,"I've been listening to Robert Cray for over 20 years now. I like the guy. He's a smooth guitarist, not flashy, tasteful licks, solid player. I like him even more as a vocalist. The problem for me is that after just listening to all of his discs in a couple of days I realized my overall interest in his music has been dwindling as the CD's go by. I have seen him several times live. I would listen again in a festival setting. I don't think I would pay premium price to see him only now. As I checked reviews I sensed the same thing from others. The songwriting is okay and the performing is still professional. I just don't get moved or feel that creative spark from his sound anymore though. Perhaps this is more a general commentary than specific to this disc. This disc is as good as most of his. It simply seems it is getting harder to distinguish his output over the past 10 years."
3,...a bit better than mediocre!,"First, I'm a fan of Robert Cray and tedious anti-war advocate, and I have to say that Cray neither lived up to his skills as player and band leader in this cd nor did he gave a anti-war message that didn't sound corny. Instead of this album, get 'strong persuader' or his 2001 release 'shoulda been home.'"
2,Ouch,"After being a loyal of fan of Robert Cray for over 25 years, I have never been so disapppointed in an album by him like I am with this one. As much as I admire artists who try to push themselves to newer and better music, the only thing Time Will Tell caused me to push was the eject button. Two stars only because I am such a huge (and disappointed) fan."
1,Political Garbage!,"Memo to Robert Cray...With your already dwindling fan base, you'd do well not to write songs with political messages. Chances are, you'll be offending at least 1/2 of your fans (me included), and that's gonna hurt sales even further. I have to say, I've been following you since Strong Persuader (even saw you in LA that year, when you performed with Clapton)...but this is the first disc of yours that I had to throw out."
5,Standard bearer for excellence in modern culture......,"Here in the days of such wantonly disposable offerings from the music industry it is indeed comforting to know that every couple of years the Robert Cray Band will buckle down and put together something that will at the very least be laudable for the effort, intelligence, integrity, musicianship and passion that went into it's creation.Time Will Tell is no disappointment. This is one of the Cray Band's finest offerings to date. From the menacing shimmer of ""Back Door Slam"" to the beautiful Hendrix chording in ""LottaLovin'"" this CD just shines. Thank you, Robert."
3,Important book but substandard layout and typesetting,"This is one of the really few computational geometry books available. It fills a niche and does it decently. However it could be better:1. The chapter layout is not very good. There are many ""revisiting this"" and ""we saw in chapter so-and-so"".2. The mathematical proofs are often written in a single paragraph full of ""English"" interspersed with mathematical notation, instead of the tried and true way of numbered equations and one-per explanations. This makes for disconcerting reading.3. The book in general could have done with more math and code, and less ""English"", not to mention more and better diagrams -- they tend to be sparsely detailed (ie. a picture is worth only a hundred words). The arrangement of diagrams also needs to be better: some are in the margins, some are in the middle, again not easy and intuitive to follow.Hopefully a future edition will address this issues."
2,"Good book, a very difficult read.","I purchased this book from Amazon last semester. While this book is a good product by itself, it makes for a very tough read. That didn't help since the subject itself is pretty tough for someone new to it. Topics that have been explained well to a decent degree Triangulation and Linear Programming. I found the explanations to Voronoi Diagram (pretty bad), Convex Hulls, Delaunay Triangulations, K-D trees, Range trees and Duality inadequate. Unfortunately, this is the best book that is both available and that I know of. The other book 'Computational Geometry' by Joseph O'Rourke was extensive as far as Convex Hulls and Triangulations were concerned, but bore significantly lesser matter - no LP, data structures and other important topics."
2,Not impressed,"As a long time fan of the true crime genre, I was really disappointed with this book. Besides the extremely disturbing nature of the crimes, it was not written in a style that held my attention. The history of the killer was glossed over , leaving the reader wanting more. Would not be able to recommend this book."
5,good true crime,"King is a good author as he takes you through the mind of a child serial killer from beginning to end.Some parts of this are very tough to read, but it does give you a true perspective of just how derangedDodd was."
3,Not bad.,"Not my favorite book, but worth the read. Would buy more of this authors titles in the future. Not Bad."
4,Sicko,"I picked up this book because I like to read true crime and the Kindle version was reasonably priced. I have to say Westley Dodd was a sick bastard. While I'm saddened for the families of the three boys who lost their lives at the hands of this monster, I'm glad he was caught before he could live out his extremely disturbing fantasies. What a scary thought that others like him walk around the earth and prey upon small, innocent children. Creatures like him are why I am pro-death penalty. Good riddance."
1,I would have to be driven to read this !!!,"I read books by Ann Rule, Kathryn Casey, MW Phelps, so I thought this one sounded interesting. This book is horrible, the other writers let you get to know the characters, this book is just sick. If you can make yourself read about sexual abuse and killing of young boys then this is the book for you."
1,Bad quality...,"Unfortunately the quality of this DVD is sooo Bad... the sound could not be any worse, and since these guys are not that great to look at anyhow, why bother? I don't see any qualities for anybody to enjoy...so spend your money on their CDs..."
2,learn to dance swing.volume 2 begineers,"Quality is great, teachers are great but there just isn't enough dance steps to warrant the $40 per DVD....basically there are 3 steps plus a dip step that most likely will not be danced or seen on the dance floor."
4,Excellent perspective on the real world,"Julian Simon must have been a tenacious SOB. He did a famous 10 year bet with Paul Ehrlich and then tried to renew it. Ehrlich chickened out. He wrote a definitive book on the economics of immigration that suggested that immigration is really a net plus of the nation. In the last few years of his life he took on the gloom sayers and the prevaricators of false science with a vigor that any scholar should admire.This book is really a reference. It goes through a number of the apocalyptic whiner's best stories and with the care of a good economist debunks both their emotion and their data. Simon was a crusader for rigor in the fields of the social sciences. Like Ronald Coase before him, he was willing to challenge conventional beliefs and then to back his notions up with data. If you want to be armed with lots of data and clear thinking on the environmental issues of our age - you should read this book."
5,In praise of the human mind and spirit,"The Ultimate Resource 2 is an optimistic review of people's ability to come up with solutions to most of the world's problems. This book and its slim companion, It's Getting Better All the Time, are excellent testaments to the power of the human mind. Backed up with solid data and chock full of charts, they illustrate the improvements (and innovations in particular) that humans have made to their environment and will likely make in the future. This text is highly recommended. My only regret is Professor Simon is no longer around to fight the good fight although thanks to this and his other books there are many others who are continuing to do so."
1,Corporate-based revisionist propaganda. Don't bother.,"Simon and others of his ilk who talk about the wonderful world we live in do so from the luxury of 6- or 7-figure incomes in the First World. He argues that the more people we have, the more likely one will become an Einstein and solve all our problems. This is Salvationistic thinking at its worst, and it's clear from his writings that he's never visited the slums of Bangkok, Haiti, or Rio...or even Washington, DC. While his writings provide rationalization and succor for rich white men, reassuring them that they play no role in the ongoing misery of the 4/5ths of the planet who live on less than $10/day, they do not reflect reality at all -- unless it's the reality of a Manhattan penthouse condo. If you want the real story, read ""Divided Planet: The Ecology of Rich and Poor"" or ""Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight"" or ""When Corporations Rule The World,"" all available here on amazon.com."
1,A man with a rare gift,"Julian Simon was a man with a rare gift: the ability to write books that made other people feel smart when quoting them. Unfortunately, Julian Simon was an idiot who made his reputation by rebuking another idiot, Paul Ehrlich of Population Bomb fame. Simon has since spawned a net cult of idiots who find meaning in their pathetic little lives by writing bad reviews of Ehrlich books they've never read on Amazon.com.Simon's work, in a nutshell, is that technological progress is irreversible and that everything is going to get better and better forever. He has said that overpopulation is a myth - nice to know that traffic jam I sit in every day is a media lie - and that if the world is ever depleted of its resources, we'll simply get in spaceships and fly away to another planetary home.If you like Utopian sci-fi and need another source of it besides Star Trek, then Julian Simon is the man for you. If you like reality, look for more balanced thinkers."
5,Boy howdy is this a good book,"If you have the slightest interest in this book, you should probably get it."
5,Environmentalists dare not read this book!,"To all Earth Firsters, Sierra Club members, etc:Reading this book is detrimental to your blissfulignorance about the economic and scientificrealities of resource use by H. sapiens. Ifyou preserve your ignorance of Simon's analysis,you will continue to have the warm fuzzy feelingof moral superiority over anyone who disagrees with your agenda."
4,For a fun casual experience,"I've ordered this along with my galaxy G1 airsoft pistol. The set comes with a base which can catch the BBs after rolling down on the board which can be reused later (huge plus). The ""sticky layer"" of the board is more of a gel substance than it is adhesive, which can be a pro or a con depending on the FPS of the gun you're shooting with. I have this board hooked on a wall with ease thanks to the retractable hanger on the back. When shooting my airsoft(~210 FPS) about 10 feet away, all of the 7 rounds managed to stick and started to roll down after hitting the board. For the money it's a great buy, but don't expect this to work with all airsofts!EDIT: After trying another type of BB pellets, I found out that certain types of BB almost always ricochets off the board! If you want an optimal experience with this target board, use the one I got which is the UHC Precision Ground Premium 6mm plastic airsoft BBs (.20)."
1,no good,"this thing broke a lot aI sent it back three times, eventually amazon told me to keep the junk and they just gave me a refund. My kids lost interest in it by them anyway. It sucks!!!!"
4,Fun for indoors or outdoors,"This thing is awesome indoor or outdoors. It may not catch all the BB's (come on guys, it's practically impossible to do this unless you have a net around the target to catch the stragglers) but it catches quiet a few. Not all BB's stick, but again - there's too many variations of guns and their FPS for all of them to stick to it."
3,Broke in a week,NOT THAT GREAT!! It is ok for couple days. that is the longer it was working for me a week ..
4,Good Target... Good Price,"My son and I got this target along with the Pulse DP4 airsoft gun. The target is useful in many ways and is at a very good price. If you shoot your airsoft BB'S at it, the bullets slowly slide down. There's just one concern... The target comes with a plastic piece on the front. When my son did it he wasn't very happy at first, but he got over it. The Crosman AirSoft Sticky Target is a great buy."
4,Almost perfect,"I have a few BB guns, some more powerful than others. This target works great with my pistols - the BBs stick right to it. With my sniper, however, it's a 50/50 chance. Sometimes the BBs just fly off of it completely. So, overall, the target is perfect for weak shots, and the tray underneath is really handy too. But if you only have powerful BB guns, you might be disappointed."
4,Very cool!,Reminds me of a big petri dish from HS. Very cool and VERY STICKY! You can literally flick a BB and it will catch. You can hang it or set it on the stand with a little tray so yuo can reuse your BBs. A strong gun will probably break the little tray with a direct hit but its worth the price.
3,Breaks Easily,"It breaks easily. Example: I left it out in the rain, and all the Gel came right off. Also, everytime a over 300 FPS gun hit the target, it would make a huge dent in the Gel. This item is horrible for high FPS guns, but pretty amazing with low FPS guns."
1,Not worth the money,The product arrived on time which is the only good thing I can say. When shooting at it it usually fell over and rarely did anything stick to it. After a day or so the sticky stuff started to fall off. I would have returned the product but my son threw out the box and it wasn't worth my time to get a partial refund without the packaging. This was a waste of money!
2,What Do You Expect for the Price,"Kind of lame. It has a peel off paper cover and target is sticky like flypaper. BB's stick but roll down target part way and you have to pick them off which gets target dirty then after time they don't stick anymore, they just bounce off. Like I said you get what you pay for."
2,Crossman Airsoft Stick target,"Sadly I didnt had a good experience with this product, while shoting at it with my airsoft gun few times the bbs would actually stick to it, dont know if the problem was the fps, since my gun have a fair fps, maybe too strong for the target to hold it, or maybe I got a defective product.I wouldnt recommend this product based on my own experience with it.I will probably get another one instead. think this oneUTG AccuShot Airsoft Competition Auto-Reset Target"
3,Not for high powered airsoft guns...,"My target arrived ups about fifteen minutes ago, I have already put two large holes clear through all the layers of the target. This was achieved with a Cyma AK47 at about 30ft.Would be great for spring guns, not so good for the higher powered guns."
3,blew holes clean throw it,It is a good target untill I got into more high power guns like my kwa m1911 mark2 well p90 dboys ak74u all of these guns blew strait threw the rubber and the plastic and kept on going good for begginers but i perfer to shot at cars and scare the craip out of people with one on the paraid of homes lol
4,good target,I bought this so when I get bored and want to shoot my airsoft pistols in the house I'm not searching for hours afterwards trying to find all the BB's. This target actually does what it's supposed to but if you want to use it like a dart board by aware that at least on mine the BB's start sliding down pretty fast as soon as they hit the target so it may be hard to see exactly where they hit. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good target to use that keeps all your ammo from getting lost.
4,does what its suposed to,"me and my friend now have good, high quality guns (i have a cyma m14 socom 16 with a 9.6v 1600 mah battery, and he has a colt m4 with and 8.4v 1100 mah battery and he has a well mb06) so when we shot at this it worked fine but we looked at the back and the plastic breaks off but if you are a begginer then your gun will not destroy this target good buy and worth it, fun and good practice"
3,Could have been sooo good,"I was delighted when I opened up my M4 carbine--which chronos at 395 fps--at this thing, and most of the BBs stuck to the gel. Some even rolled down into the base after a while, just like the description says.But then I used this product for target practice with my TSD M1911 non-blowback, which puts out at 500 fps. The BBs blew through the gel and the hard plastic back, leaving shards of black plastic in their wake. I am now considering how to reinforce the back. (Glue on another layer of plastic? Plywood maybe?) If only Crosman had made a bit stronger product, it would have earned a five-star review. Since the target is currently useless, that's not my rating."
4,SPRING ONLY! NO GAS!,"I feel this is designed for .12 spring guns. If you have one, the bbs will stick, and within a few seconds, roll down, so you don't have bb to bb contact. A 330 fps .25 GBB will rip through the gel layer and ricochet off the foam behind it. Other than that, it's great. It's also washable. The gel shouldn't lose it's stick."
5,Great target for the price,I got this target so i could shoot my airsoft guns and not loose all of my bbs. it is fairly durable and the bbs stick well. i have had this target for over a year and the stickiness is just now starting to wear out. the plastic is pretty strong so you wont have to worry about it breaking if dropped (except my c02 airsoft pistol put a hole right through the bb tray...)i would highly recomend this product and when the stickyness wears out just wash it with soap and it becomes sticky again.
2,Weak brittle plactic back,"It sort of works. The sticky face stopped all of the pellets, and some stuck if not fired at an angle, but pieces were knocked out of the plastic backing.Since my AMAZON order was for two, the second one is getting extra backing bonded to the back side. I don't think this will stop the breakage but will hold the pieces in place."
4,"Works, but could be more durable","This thing is great for lower powered airsoft guns, typically 350fps or below. But if you go above that, especially with an automatic... it'll blow the back out of the thing.Still, I recommend it because it works great, but beware of shooting it with a high powered automatic airsoft gun."
1,Crosman can't seem to make a decent product!!!,"I bought this to catch all the airsoft BB's that I like to shoot from my AEG indoors to relieve stress. When it first arrived, I took it out and1) The sticky gel was halfway peeled from the backing and would not stay in place.2) The sticky gel looked like it had been cut by a 4 year old with dull scissors and did not fit the stand (there were large gaps around the perimeter of the target not covered in sticky gel.Suffice it to say I sent it right back and have vowed to never buy crosman products ever again!!!!"
1,false addvertizment,this is a terrible product non of my bb's stick it just flys off the first bb's shot hit my eye
4,Decent target.,This is a good target for pistols and long range weapons but dont use aAEG on it because it will hurt the board.if it wasnt for it lack of use for an AEG gun then i would have given it 5 stars.Use paper targets for aegs if you dont mind losing the bbs
5,A great target!,This target does wonders for me when I need to adjust my sights and it lets you reuse the bb's too! I recommend this to any airsoft players.
2,You get what you pay for...,It is fun and cool but my bullets go through the foam and out the back. Still works technically just not well. For 8 bucks I would still do it again but just buyer beware.
3,good target,This target work very well. After the BB hits the jell it rolls down on to the collection tray. If using a rifle that shoots more than 300 fps it will stick in the jell and you have to pull then off. After shooting at it with a 370 fps sniper the bbs would go through the foam with the jell and break the plastic back. It only good with a low power guns.
3,it's okay,nothing great but nothing terrible either.. Has this sticky coating on the target to catch the bb's.. I can see the sticky film not lasting long but would like to save as many bb's as I can..So it's fine and does catch bb's but not 100% of the time..
5,solid,"For the price you can't beat the simplicity and durability of this product. I find air-soft target shooting relaxing and a great stress reliever. Figure I'd try this out since shooting cardboard boxes makes a mess and cleaning bb's just stresses me out even more. I have a net system but bb's shot at over 250fps just bounces out. Just for fun I tried this target with my m1911 gas blowback pistol. At 45' away, I engaged the target fully loaded with a co2 mag firing .25bb's. The bb's stuck, rolled off and did not damage the target. Impressive. Considering the bb's were traveling more than 300fps. A cheap solution to target practice indoors without the mess. I suggest to keep the cover so that dust does not collect on the surface. Or you can use wax paper. Other than that, the best target for the value. I only wish they made ones with an interchangeable target boards for a more diverse target options, since the gel material is see through."
4,Not Bad for the Money,"My son made the most of the target especially to help sight in his scope and adjust the hop of his AS gun...It's pictured with a stand but we did not get one so we had to lean it against something or hung it up on a tree. You do need to store it in a clean,dust free enviorment when not in use as it does attract/hold dust and dirt. We actually put the protective film it came packaged with back on the target when not in use."
1,Not for stronger Airsoft,"Shot straight through it from 30 ft with my Airsoft Rifle. That doesn't seem right to me! That's too far to even see it without a scope, so I would expect it to hold up with this medium power gun. The ones that actually hit and stuck are STILL stuck, so the roll off fail."
1,Must have been Defective!,"I saw all the good reviews and decided to try this product for my Airsoft Pistols. The first day I tried it, about 75% of the BBs stuck to the target. Since it is a sticky target, I put the cover back on when I put it away. The second time I tried it, only 3 of 25 BBs stuck to the target. I touched the target and it was not sticky at all. I don't know what happened, but the target is now worthless. Based on the good reviews on Amazon, I may have gotten a defective product, but I think I will try a different product anyway."
3,Good at first,"I bought this a while back, when I was into airsoft. It was a great target, taking hits from high powered airsoft guns. The pellets always stuck, but after a while of use, they started to stick for a few seconds and roll off. After a few weeks of use, the sticky padding fell off. I put it back in, but it never stayed in place for a long time. I used hot glue, but that didn't work either.After a month and a half, the sticky padding was completely done for.Great product of kept clean. Once it's dirty or once the sticky pad falls off, it will never be the same."
3,Depends,This is a good get if your planning not to fire the bb in a mach. My friend and I used this in his basement then tried using the bb in a mach then some got stuck to the spring. I lost about 3/4 of my bb to this product. Other wise it's a good get.
4,Good deal,"Very pleased. I use it whenever weather prevents me from walking outdoors. I am not a person who enjoys indoor exercise and have tried treadmill and eliptical machine but hated it and eventually stopped using them. This bike is quiet, can sit and watch TV or videos on my computer while I bike. I just put my laptop on a little table next to me. The foot straps are a good idea. If it folded up for storage it would be perfect, but it is not too difficult to push it to the side of the room."
5,Nice bike for the price,This bike was very easy to assemble. My 11 year old son was able to do it. It is very quiet and has consistant resistance. I like the low display so I can watch TV or read a book without it being in the way. I've only had it a few weeks. So far So good.
3,Do Not Believe What You Read,"I always tell my wife before I buy something on Amazon.com, ""I read the critques of others who bought the same item. They were positive. Do not worry because I know what I am doing when I buy these things on-line.""Except with this exercise bike. It arrived damaged and the bike was a challenge to assemble. I considered it to be a geniune piece of junk, but that is just my opinion. Amazon gave me a refund, but what a pain."
3,Gets the job done but very noisy!,My husband put it together for me and said some parts were very difficult to fit together. He actually had to use vasoline on some of the pieces! It feels very sturdy when you are on it but it is very loud! I wish I had spent a bit more money to get a better bike!
5,Three Years and Counting...,"I took a chance on the Phoenix 99608 Magnetic Recumbent Exercise Bike back in July of 2009. Since that time, I have NOT been disappointed. This bike actually makes working out fun. It is an essential tool in my exercise routine and something I look forward to using every day. Three years later, it continues to function just as smoothly and quietly as it did when it arrived."
4,Recumbent bike,"This bike has worked really well for me - it is quiet and rides smoothly. the only thing that gave me trouble was when putting together, I was never able to get one of the bolts into the underneath part of the seat - there are four and I could only get three in - the hole was a little off."
4,Excellent Macine at a Very Good Price,"This machine is well-designed and well-made of quality materials. It is sturdy, compact, quiet and functions exactly as it is supposed to. Assembly was straightforward and everything fit properly. It took me about 50 minutes to assemble working at a leisurely pace. The levels of resistance are appropriate for me, but for someone who is young, fit and strong, the maximum may not be enough. Adjustment for different users of different sizes is not as easy as on some more expensive models I looked at locally, but it still can be done in less than a minute. The price is right and you can get free shipping from Amazon (regular shipping would be about $40)."
5,as advertised,"This is a bare bones system that works well. I use it as part of a varied workout routine. It's simple workout display gives me all the information I need....speed, time, calories and distance. Without the big console many higher end bikes have, it's easy to watch tv and knockout a half hour ride seemlessly. The ride is smooth and quiet and easily adjustable. It's simple enough to use that you might just stick to the program.....if not how much did you lose?"
2,buy something with higher comfort & build quality,"1 star for cost1 star for silent operation-1 star for range of difficulty-1 star for comfort-1 star for frame wiggleThe setup went well with easy to follow directions and detailed diagrams. The bike is quiet when pedaling. I get motion sick after riding this bike because the frame is moving with every pedal rotation. The seat is uncomfortably hard. There's not a large enough difference between the resistance settings. If I did it again, I would buy something with more comfort and a higher quality build - it would be worth it for the amount of time spent getting fit."
4,Great for the price,"Got this for my wife who cannot use an upright bike. She loves it.It was easy to assemble and set up, although it could have been packaged a little better. A small piece of the plastic shroud broke off in shipping, but in no way impacted on function. It was small enough that I just glued it back on. The electronic display is handy with it's timer, distance and other functions. I like the scan mode, where it cycles through each function continuously.The only improvement I would suggest is another adjustment hole or two to move the seat closer to the pedals. My wife is 5'2"". The closest setting just makes it for her. Someone shorter may find it uncomfortable having to stretch for the pedals.The seat and seating angle are quite comfortable. My wife can easily read or watch TV while riding. On the whole, we are quite happy with the bike."
5,A perfect cabin fever bike,"I wanted something to use as a backup on winter days when I can't walk or bike outside. This suits my needs perfectly. It's quiet, so I can watch a Sopranos episode while I ride. As promised, it's easy to assemble. Speed, time, and calorie indicators are easy to read. And, best of all, you just turn a knob to increase the tension! If you're a low-tech walker or casual jogger/cyclist, this one's for you. Oh yeah...The price is right, too. It's a deal you can't refuse!"
2,"Excellent, but may have a problem.","The exercise bike is excellent in design and seems to be of good workmanship, but unfortunately has already developed a noise when peddled that sounds like ""something slipping"" for lack of a better term. I have been to busy to call the company and ask about this. Dr. Sam Fadala over and out...."
3,Reconditioned? HAH!,"I purchased this ""reconditioned"" from Amazon. It was missing the 'computer'(display)In it's place there was only a cut wire. Did anyone even look at this before calling it 'reconditioned'?"
3,"Pedal fell off, threading is stripped. Anyone have a # for Customer Service?","I bought this late 2008 - and the whole family has used it extensively.WARNING: if the pedal is slipping out of place, tighten it securely with a vise grip IMMEDIATELY. Delaying will cause the threading to strip on the arm, and since that was part of the pre-assembled chassis, it couldn't be easy to replace.If anyone can post the customer service number from their manual, I would be mighty obliged. Can't find it online. Any ideas how to keep the pedal on after the threading is stripped is also appreciated. Otherwise, I gotta re-purchase the bike. Yes, I would buy it again, with all of its foibles (adjustment knob falling off and getting in the way, speedometer falling off, foot straps on the pedals periodically coming off) it was a great bike."
4,recumbent bikes STILL makes you sweat!!!,"it was delivered on time. my boyfriend put it together & the tools were provided for him so it was quick & painless - only thing is that i'm only 5' 2"" and it doesn't have a hole to snap on for short people like me. it still works, nevertheless. @ first my boyfriend thought that riding the recumbent bike was NOT going to make him sweat & boy! was he wrong. he said it was pretty good & not bad for what i paid for. my daughter & i enjoy it. we watch our dvr'd shows while riding which is basically multi-tasking, right? i even suggested this to my sister who's got 3 kids - that way she can have a bit of exercise while watching the kids play in the back yard. it's not heavy you can move it around. in short, buy it."
4,Good exercise bike,For its purpose it is excellent and it will hold more than the suggested weight. Very study and worth the money.
5,Great Recumbent Exercise Bike,"This is a great little bike that doesn't take up too much space and is easily maneuvered. It has seven adjustable settings and is very comfortable to sit in, especially while watching T.V. I received my bike a day earlier then it stated, which was great, and it came, unscratched, with all needed parts and instructions. I am extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend this to anyone looking to workout indoors while relaxing in front of a T.V., staring out your window, or reading a good book."
5,Nice Bike for the $$$,"Easy to assemble, very quiet and comfortable. Doesn't take up much space and is perfect for my use. Others who have reviewed this product have gotten broken or damaged parts, but mine arrived safe and sound. No problems."
4,Easy work,Assembly was not difficult even for an old codger like me. Operation is smooth and appears to be equal to the very expensive units at the local Spa. Both my wife and I are pleased with the unit which is performing exactly as we expected.
4,"quiet, functonal and value","Just a basic , functional quiet straightfoward stationary bike, the whole family uses it. My only complaint is it's not so good for people who are short or petite. Probably another whole or two is needed to shorten the length."
4,My New Recumbent Bike,"I was excited to replace my lazy chair with a recumbent bike as my first step to making TV time productive weight loss time. This machine is very quiet so I don't have that old wind whine that the older machines had. Assembly was smart enough for someone who hates ""some assembly required"" that I had it going in no time. It is as advertised! Perhaps my only beef is that the digital screen showing you how much you are burning and how far you've gone is that typical Black on Gray background which, as you know, makes it hard to read sometimes but that's just being picky. Really this is a great machine, just don't forget to turn up the tension once in a while or its just movement. :)"
4,DVD was good,I liked the movie and the riffing but was not my favorite. Prefer MST3K or Rifftrax might give these guys another shot down the road...
4,Muzzy start a language,The item was for my great-granson so I am awaiting results on his learning the material but I would recomend it to others
2,Not for us,"My kids are 4 & 5 and know Spanish. I thought this would really help with context and all that jazz. They are just not into it. The computer portion that comes with it does not work properly and it does not install on the computer. You must use the cd each time. SInce it does not automatically run through lessons it sucks. I heard this was the best brand too. Oh well, back to books and the basics."
3,Not bad,I was hoping there would be The Weiss on the screen as they were spoken but aside from that its a cute show. We only watched it once so far but my boys 8 & 3 have already been repeating a couple of things.
5,Great for all!,"This CD has achieved the hard to reach goal of perfect balance between narration and music.The narration is interesting and soothing and the voice is mesmerizing.As the creator of the children's relaxation ""Indigo Dreams"" series I am often asked to recommend CD's for adults.I highly recommend this journey with the dolphins and imagaination for any one that is looking to escape the stress of today's world. It is entertaining and simple enough for anyone to enjoy ! This Bliss Trips Series is very well done and is sure to help you relax while increasing your health and well being!"
4,dolphin's dance,"Experiencing Dolphin's Dance is restful, restorative and best of all fun. This is better than swimming with real dolphins. Imaginative, perfect for people of all ages."
5,Dolphin's Dance,This CD is as soothing and intelligent as the creature's it is named after... What a fabulous relaxation and meditation aide! Highly recommended
5,A great starter workout!,"I have a bunch of workout DVDs--some aerobics, some Tae Bo. But it's really hard for me to stick with anything on a regular basis. This one is great. Leslie is very motivating, the people working out have all lost weight doing this workout, and they don't have PERFECT athletic bodies. They're normal! ;o) This video helps me stay motivated and disciplined to do it every day, and then I plan to do my other videos every so often for some variety. I definitely reccommend it for anyone needing some discipline for exercising! Once I build up to where this video is easy for me, I plan to get the Two Mile workout as well. Good luck, and stick with it!! :o)"
4,Not a bad start for couch potatoes!,This was not a bad workout video. I hate to exercise but at this point in my life I really needed to do something to get in shape. I didint want the typical workout videos that are avilable on the market. My God! Who could keep up with those guys if the only exercise you get is lifting the remote control to the tv daily! I mean I get tired just walking up a flight of stairs of running after my 2 yr old. Housework was even exhausting for me. This video was easy to follow and it is the perfect start for anyone who wants to get in shape and/or loose some weight. I have only been at it for a few weeks now but I feel better already. I would recommend this to anyone who is a beginner at exercise and wants to get in shape.
1,Eat carefully!,"The bars taste ok, they're easy to eat and relatively healthy. That being said, beware! I actually chipped my tooth on a pit fragment of some kind. I bought a case, and so far two of the eight bars I've eaten have had large, rock-hard pit fragments."
1,Disappointing,"These are extremely disappointing as I absolutely LOVE raw bars and have eaten many a Lara Bar. These in no way compare and oddly enough, taste like cardboard. I have no idea how these can taste so bad when they are made with such good ingredients."
2,"Decent, but not the best",Has an oily film on it. Good flavor. Somewhat thick consistency. Made me question whether it was really raw. It seemed more manufactured or processed than other raw foods I've had.
3,"This bar has changed, lately not as good","This used to be a great bar, however lately it has changed. It's gotten smaller in size, the size has changed, and the taste is as chocolatey or as intense. It still has good quality ingredients though, and is a good change of pace from other gluten-free and healthy bars."
3,Taste takes some getting used to!,"We don't usually eat ""live food"", but I was looking for a healthy bar for my kids. While this is a great, healthy, full of iron food, we just couldn't aquire a taste for them. I passed them along to my health guru friend and she loved them."
4,Healthy Snack,"The bars have a mild chocolate and raspberry taste. It looks like a power bar in a little bit of liquid (oil-like), but has more of a dense-brownie texture. It's a good choice for a healthy snack. Everyone in my household liked it, and they disappeared quickly."
2,Passable snack,"With a list of ingredients like this, it is hard to believe that this is only passable. The chocolate is underwhelming, the tartness of the agave is overwhelming."
5,Highly Recommended!,High Quality! Excellent price on Amazon using Subscribe and Save. Great Taste! The whole line is excellent. I like every flavor I've tried so far...
2,High fat and not that tasty,"Cashews are imported, and usually not really raw. This bar is so oily that it almost slides out of the wrapper. Doesn't taste like real food. Try the Lara bar."
3,Meh...an OK flavor,"I'm a big fan of the Spirulina and Cashew flavor...this, not so much. Very heavy tasting. It's hard to make it through a whole bar."
4,"good, healthy, and filling","these do have the usual drawbacks of all food bars - gooey and overly sweet, but they are better than most."
3,OK,"Pros-Healthy ingredientsLow sodiumNo Trans FatsNo CholesterolGood Source of ProteinCons-High in Calories and fatNot High in VitaminsWhen I ordered the RR bars I was hoping that they would have bigger chunks of the ingredients but it is more like they put everything in a food processor. I was also hoping for raspberry chunks but this uses raspberry powder. These bars are definitely an acquired taste but they aren't any worse than the ""traditional energy bars"" and I still do like that they have wholesome ingredients instead of all the funky stuff. I do like that these don't leave me with a bloated heavy feeling but they are satisfying. I will be using these as a meal replacement instead of the energy bars that need not be named."
1,All that glisters is not gold,"The words 'organic' and 'chocolate' attracted me to these bars, but I could barely choke one down. I don't think I even ate the whole bar I tried, most of it went into the trash, where the rest of the box followed, after a bite or two."
2,"Cheapo hit CD thrown together after ""Motown 25""","This piece of marketing foof doesn't begin to do justice to the legendary Smokey Robinson. After the surge in interest in all things Motown after the ""Motown 25"" TV special, this pretty bad compilation CD appeared in the stores. The title song was a midchart hit and not very good, therefore a weak draw for the record. Far worse than that was the exclusion of any early solo hits except for ""Baby Come Close."" Clearly a superficially-executed disc for the superficial fan who didn't realize the man existed before ""Cruisin'"". ""...and All The Great Hits""??? They have got to be kidding.Hopefully soon to fall out-of-print in favor of the FAR superior ""Ultimate Collection"" and ""Solo Anthology."""
1,made in china,"Although the Aqua Clear 20 is made in Italy, the replacement carbon is made in China. The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was a strange smell. At first I did not know where it was coming from, then I realized that what I just opened up definitely smelled like raw chicken. Even after rinsing repeatedly with salt water it still had this strange odor. I was worried about using this in my aquarium; I eventually washed it twice with mild soap and water (I wonder what this will do to the carbon), then I rinsed it with salt water and it finally smelled OK to me. What the hell are they doing at the plant where this carbon is made? I think in the future I may make my own filters using these mesh bags that are sold separately at some pet stores. (you can buy activated carbon you can buy in bulk)."
4,Great for Georgia History Buffs,"As a descendant of a soldier in this regiment, I was thrilled at the detail and history in this book. Definitely worth the purchase and something I will happily pass down to my children."
4,Book Review,I bought this book for a psychology class I am taking and this book is very knowledgeable and easy to follow.
2,Workout,"This is a good workout, but moves really fast with little or bad instructions. Be prepared to watch it a few times before really being able to keep up."
1,terrible scroll wheel,"I just bought one of these from ""Office Despot"", beingdesperate after my old mouse failed. After 15 minutesuse I'm returning it. The scroll wheel on the one Ibought is uncomfortable, but worse, when I try toscroll I often get a ""scroll wheel button push""instead. This happens maybe about half the time, andI couldn't solve the problem by using a lighter touchon the scroll wheel.I use a scroll wheel all the time so this mouse is justunacceptable for me."
2,"OK, but driver crashes under Windows XP SP2","I bought this mouse to use with my laptop when I'm working at my desk, preferring a mouse for some tasks. Unlike others, I had no problem with the mouse's tracking or scroll wheel. The scroll wheel has a good feel, as do the buttons. The mouse fits well in my largish hands (big palms, stubby fingers). The problem is in the driver. The driver supplied with Windows XP (no driver is included in the box) crashes a lot, causing a hiccup in my work. The mouse stops responding for a couple of seconds, then I am prompted to send an error report to Microsoft. I downloaded the latest (as of 6/1/2007) Intellipoint driver from Microsoft, and the crashes actually increased in frequency. An OEM Dell unit (optical, scroll wheel) plugged into the same system never crashes.The Microsoft mouse is fine as a mouse, especially for the low price, but the software doesn't work, at least on some systems."
2,could be better,"i've come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse. the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface, and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser won't track right. i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didn't test it well enough. unless your willing to do that skip this one, it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice. i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul. but then again you do get what you pay for :/"
3,"Loud scroll wheel, but great otherwise.","3.5 Stars. I bought this for a spare computer in another room so I don't use it extensively, but it works just fine. Unpackaged it, plugged it into a USB port and it works without a hitch. Very smooth action; no skipping and feels comfortable under the hand. Even though it's just a hard plastic material all around (in the photo, the black area on top of the mouse looks like it might be soft rubber or something - it's not), the shape is at least ergonomic. The only complaint I have is that the scroll wheel is really loud. Clickety-Clackety all the way up and down. So if you are in the habit of using the scroll wheel a lot, I wouldn't recommend this mouse. But if you're just looking for a basic, no nonsense, workhorse of a mouse, this is a great and affordable choice. Looks nice, too."
3,LARGE Desktop Mouse,"I didn't realize that this mouse was the standard large desktop size. I was looking for something smaller so I wasn't a fan of this mouse. That being said, it is a good mouse. It responds well, would probably be comfortable if you wanted something large, and worked just fine. I had a bit of trouble when I tried to scroll-click close my Chrome tabs. It wouldn't respond each time but that wasn't really a problem.If you're looking for a simple, attractive desktop mouse, this is a great choice. If you want a notebook-sized mouse, look elsewhere."
2,Microsoft Optical Mouse,"Skip this one. This mouse sticks or grabs your mouse pad while using it. It doesn't seem to be up to quality attributes of Microsoft. You have to use it on a very glossy surface for it work normally. Decide for yourself if you want to purchase, just make sure you use it on the right hard surface for proper operations. It works fine otherwise."
4,"Misleading specifications, but for $10, it still works pretty well","The mouse works pretty well, but I was misled by the technical specifications that listed this product as a ""High Definition Laser mouse"". It is NOT a laser mouse; it's a standard LED optical mouse. It does work fairly well for a regular optical mouse, but I lowered the rating to 4 stars because of the misleading information."
2,Scroll wheel is loud,"I bought this instead of the basic Microsoft mouse because it looks better. However, the scroll wheel is not very smooth and really loud. I am going to buy the standard Microsoft basic mouse instead."

5,Equine Florida Sore Cure,"This product is great. You have to be persistant though and wrap the site which is usually on the horse's lower leg, plus treat and change it every other day until gone. Only treat the red, bloody opening, not the healthy skin around it. It may take several sticks per treatment depending on the size of the sore. Fly elimination is also a necessity and should be addressed. Also the stick stings when applied, so don't get kicked.I used my DISCOVER Cash-Back $ and the shipping was free, so I really made out, plus I cured my horse's problem."
5,silver nitrate applicators,"Seems to be a fine product. The sticks all arrived intact with non of the disintegration of the silver nitrate tip that I have seen on occasion. Althoug seldom required, they are about the most efficient way of managing an acute kanker sore of the mouth and some other sites of granulating inflammatory tissues."
5,I've become an even greater fan of Cuauhtemoc Sanchez..,"While I was in highschool over in Guadalajara, Mexico. My Literature teacher raffled book titles in which we would write the usual book-reports. Back then I was more into ficticious stories and school books and I wasn't really interested in reading novels. But the moment I finished the 1st chapter I couldn't believe the talent this man has in relating all of his characters..to me this a huge point to his favor. I said goodbye to all those ridiculous stories of fantasies and actually enjoyed the point Mr. Sanchez wanted to make clear. Not only is this book worth reading, but it also helps you view life from a diferent point of view..using psychology and helps by giving tips. And for once you can finally know what goes through the mind of the ""other people"". The two sides of the story..."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This book makes you feel different empty emotions, this is the hook. Perhaps, the translator makes better work than the Author, but the emptiness is here anyway (and the full-of-money pocket of Mr. Sánchez). DON'T BUY IT...."
5,Absolutely necesary if planning to have or have a family,"I have 4 children and like most parents who are honest with themselves, I find myself making so many mistakes in childrearing and wondering how they will affect my children in the long run. When I read this book all of my questions were answered. The book is written in such an easy style that you find yourself not being able to put it down. The solutions to all parents problems are given in this wonderful book and the style permits you to remember what you read for future aplication. What good is it to us if a week after we read it we cant remember its essence? That dosnt happen with this book. In fact, you find yourself talking to all those you love about it and how you feel they must have it. It really is a book that all that have or are planning to have a family MUST read."
2,Rita Dove is Ok,The book was ok it wasn't the best book i've evr read. I would say the book can put you to sleep a little. Most of the poems are good but if yo are a teenage girl you wouldn't like the book. She could have did a better job with her description and characteristics. But throughout the book she just talked like she was in the olden days and it's 2006 she needs to write like it's 2006. Kids might get bored off of her book i know i did. Although i didn't like the book personally others might like it so just read it and you well see.

2,"Wouldn't Touch 2.5 or 3.25, 3.5, 3.75 with Full Shields and a 10-meter Grappling Hook?","Fine, paid for 2003 miniseries twice and BSG 2.0 was the last monies spent on this over-priced series rip.Watch, enjoy, and forget about this awful money waster on circulare plastic discs unless you have the cash to burn.LONG LIVE ~ BABYLON 5 ~ RULES!!"
4,Continues the Story,"I got into the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica after watching a few episodes of the spin off series Caprica, this spring so i was spared the long waits between seasons that fans who watched the series on tv experienced. i was glad to find this set with bundles both halves of season 2 so that i could watch the season uninterrupted. it was a great value!"
4,Battlestar Galactica Series,Arrived right when promised and in excellent condition. Just like I bought it in the store only it cost less.
5,"Mature, emotionally intense examination of values","Battlestar Galactica is a mature and emotionally intense examination of the values we profess to hold as human beings living in a highly developed society. The line is blurred between what is human and humane and what is mechanistic. There is no black and white in the choices that must be made to ensure the survival of humanity; every choice is nuanced by conflicting values and ethics and placed in the context of the survival of humanity. But even in the context of the surrvival of humanity, there are serious doubts cast upon the actions and behaviours that represent the so-called best evidence of what humanity is.Galactica is an outstanding series. It is thoughtful, supremely well performed and addictive."
5,as described.,The aqua clear insert activated carbon worked for my Aqua Clear 50. I like the longer change intervals on these bags. Its less work for me.
5,Never going back to other filter media.,"Years ago I used to use Aqua Clear filters & media and when I got back into having a aquarium, I tried something else. Big mistake. After three different types of over the tank filters, I realized there is only one filter I can trust to keep my tank crystal clear and is super easy to maintain. It's so nice to have separate filter media to change."
2,Disappointed overall,"The date given on the game box is 2004, but these games were obviously created long before, then repackaged, and it shows. Actually the puzzles are inventive, and the scenery is at times beautiful, but the 5-10 second hesitations between clicks is maddening, and I never even came close to ""losing myself"" in this world. The characters behaved artifically, sounded articial, and the scenery, though beautiful, again, artificial (dayglo and garish). Why were there no Myans in the Myan city preparing for war? It was two pyramids and empty. This may have been a great game for the Commodore 64 back in the 1980's, but to me it was just annoying, and the constant flow of New Age music didn't help."
2,"For others, this might be fine.","I hate leaving poor reviews but I'm not sure what to think of this gam. I've tried twice now and just can't get into it. I collect PC games of all styles, but this one just doesn't hold me like most other games do. Maybe you will have more luck with it. I hope so!"
2,Not as great,"I don't know why this book got so much good reviews. There seemed to be no story line. Half of the time, Macy seemed like she had no energy and no feelings. This book was a drag. Some parts were okay but to me, it was not all that great. It seemed like Macy and Wes would never get together. She seemed like a very stubborn girl. It took her forever to step out of her shell. I usually like these type of books, but this one didn't do it for me."
3,It was alright...not exactly what I expected given other reviews,"This was a pretty ok book. I couldn't really get into it. There was a part around page 200 when I thought it'd get better and seemed like it was, only to be disappointed that the storyline went back to just being ok. Then in the last three chapters it felt like it just suddenly rushed in together. Like the author finally got tired of dancing around the subject matter and finally had the characters in it address the issues at hand. I just don't like to be drawn out for so long when really it could've happened sooner and led to a different change in the story.This was my first Dessen book. The ratings were AMAZING and even a friend suggested I read it too, so I couldn't refuse to not buy it. So...this is my take as a first time Dessen fan. Honestly not sure if I'll be reading another of hers anytime soon...possibly. I just have this nagging feeling that all her writings of books are probably going to have this same outcome."
3,"Good, Not Great","You really do feel for Macy as she goes on with her life after the loss of her father. You see the story of her life after a tragic loss, and how people really do play a role in healing and living life.Although it was a good story when it came to Macy's process of grieving over her father, I felt that the story failed to capture me in certain areas. As I progressed through the book, I was no longer enthralled by the story, putting it down several times to catch a break. With such a deep topic, dealing with the loss of a loved one, I feel that it would have been really good had there been some sort of breaking point. I expected more from this book but it still deserves some credit.After all, the romance in a story always gets me. :)"
2,not for me,This book was not for me. Maybe it's because I am a 20 year old college student and the book is geared for kids in high school or maybe because it's not the genre I usually read. It dealt with very serious issues and it is a perfect book for adolescents trying to find themselves. The writing by Sarah Dessen was very strong and I can see why people would love this book. It just wasn't for me.
3,don't read this book,"The Truth About Forever is contemporary realistic fiction and is filled with fun, love and excitement. It's a pretty easy read, but at times it can be confusing.Jason, Macy's boyfriend, is at Brain Camp while she is obligated to work at the library this summer. And every so often is catering at Wish. When she meets Wes, while Jason is at camp, Macy's life turns around.Sarah Dessen is the author of The Truth about Forever, This Lullaby, How to Deal, a New York Times bestseller, and the two books that later turned into the movie, That Summer and Someone Like You. Sarah Dessen teaches creative writing at the University of North Carolina, where she graduated.The Truth About Forever starts out as a pretty good book, but as it continues it starts to get confusing and moves very slowly. I would recommend this book to teenagers from 8th grade and up. I did not enjoy reading The Truth About Forever."
4,Wonderful book for my first introduction to the author,"I've never read anything by Sarah Dessen before. I wanted to give her a try. Not sure why I picked this book, but I'm glad I did. And I will be reading more of her books. This was a feel good story that I think is perfect for teens. Her characters are very real and the actions taken are believable. I was engrossed in the story from the first page. It's not action packed, but a carefully constructed story with a real message. I identified with the main character and what she was going through. Overall, it was a wonderful story."
5,the truth about forever:book review,"although i enjoy all of sarah dessen's pieces, i must say that this is her best. the truth about forever is funny, heartbreaking, and truly sensational. even if you dont read sarah dessen's books you will enjoy every page."
3,An okay book,"First off, I am not a Sarah Dessen fan. I read this book because it was recommended to me by a fan. That said, I did not really enjoy this book. I thought it was well written, but I never grew to care about what happened to the characters. All the characters seemed very cookie cutter and I thought it was slow at certain parts. However, I have a lot of friends that like this book, so maybe it just wasn't for me, but if you like Sarah Dessen books, you will probably enjoy ""The Truth About Forever."""
4,The Truth About Forever,"While The Truth About Forever may not be the most memorable or remarkable of Sarah Dessen's books, it's still a heartwarming story of family and forever. It takes a while for the story to really get started, but it is very much worth the wait. Once again, we are presented with an amazing, diverse cast of wacky characters and grow to love them all for their quirks. It's Sarah Dessen, so idealism is slightly expected, but I feel as if the idealism is overdone in this book more than any (particularly with the whole 'running' metaphor). I found Macy and Wes's ongoing game of Truth to be my favorite part of the book by far, fitting with Dessen's remarkable style of writing, full of her own poignant life truths. The ending was a bit anticlimactic--I think it should have just ended with the game, and the last two scenes would have worked well (with some tweaking) before that.Rating: 4/5"
5,An Addictive Story with Great Characters,"The Truth About Forever is my second Sarah Dessen Book. I have to say, I enjoy her writing. The story focuses on Macy after her dad's death. Macy is written to a tee. She experiences all kinds of emotions and they all seem real. There were definitely some times that I wanted to shake some sense into her, though. I understood why she was with Jason, but I thought it was strange how she never questioned the relationship. It's almost as if she's blind. Kristy, who is introduced a few chapters in, was the answer to my prayers. She tells Macy like it is and helps her see the light.This book sucked me in from beginning to end. The character development is great, and so is the story. If you haven't read any Sarah Dessen yet, I'd suggest you try this one on for size."
5,My favorite book of all time.,"Whenever anyone asks me, ""What's your favorite book?"" I am able to answer without hesitation: THE TRUTH ABOUT FOREVER.I read this book often, whenever I need a reminder about how to look at life, how to deal with loss, or just a good laugh. Sarah Dessen creates a wonderful story that will stay with you for a long time after you read it. Macy is a believable character whose journey will jump off the pages and tug at your heart, as you, too, wonder how you want to spend your forever."
5,Great Book for Teenagers!,"This book was the cutest book ever, i seriously couldnt put it down. If your wondering whether or not to order this book because you dont know how great it really is, TRUST ME its worth it!"
4,Another good one,"This is the second novel by Sarah Dessen that I have read. There is something about her writing style that makes her characters and their stories very real and intriguing.The plot is not spectacular, and is predictable. Again, a young princess falls for the social outcast, mystery boy. The characters themselves are what make this a good read.The main character, Macy, has worked hard to make her life as routine and safe as possible. She feels she needs to be perfect for her mother and in trying to do so she becomes numb to her own desires.Prince charming shows up in the form of a co-worker and though Macy resists at first, she eventually gives in to love and a new look on life.This is a fun, happy read and I recommend it to anyone."
3,Doesn't quite live up to her other books!,"Hey, this book was a little disapointing after reading the amazing Someone Like You, This Lullaby, and Dreamland. I guess you can't keep writing hit after hit... But this book is still really good, just not what I'd expect from Dessen. The characters are really believable, funny, and brought to life. I'd still recommend reading this novel- just don't expect the typical Dessen magic."
5,Definately Something Good to Read,"Sarah Dessen does it again! Her book, The Truth About Forever is the story of Macy, whose father died 1 and 1/2 years ago. Since then, she's set her sights on ""trying to be perfect"". Taking place during the summer of her 16th year, her ""perfect"", boring boyfriend, Jason is away. After Jason emails her saying he thounks it would be better if they take a breather, Macy goes out on a limb and takes a job catering. There she meets some fun-loving, good, kind-hearted teens and learns the real truth about forever. I loved this book because it was so realistic. It showed how chaos and disorder isn't always terrible."
4,Dessen Does It Again,"Sarah Dessen follows up This Lullaby with another genius novel about teen romance and angst. The characters brought a certain tone to the book that is unforgetable, and Macy was the perfect compination of sweet and sour. Dessen added a neat thing for fans by adding characters and places in this novel that hinted to her other books.Bravo!"
5,Hits home,"I couldn't find anything to say bad about this book. It's impossible. Sarah Dessen hits a homerun with this, creating characters and situations that draw you in and make you love them. I am in a similar situation and I felt like she wrote the book about my life. The feelings are incredibly true and heart wrenching."
3,ehhhhh...,"this book was all right; it was the first book I ever read of Sarah Dessen's; it was cute but I wish Wes had a little more to him and the story kind of dragged, but it was still all right and made you want to keep reading."
3,content-wise this book. . .,"A book from the young adult section without sex is always awesome! It was a nice story. I liked the whole theme of forever throughout the book. It was definitely nice to read how someone deals with loss in different ways, and how different people form relationships with others through their feelings of loss. Good book. there is light language and underage drinking in it."
5,I loved it,The story was just so sweet as in many of dessen's book. Good and easy read i couldn't put it down
3,Dragged On,"This was not a bad book by any means, but it did drag on far too long and the plot wasn't very creative. There were way too many things going on in the book at once and it seemed very repetitive. Also, the characters in the book were very one dimensional. Very few characters in the book were likeable to me."
4,Reveiw from a 24 year old,"I know I probably should grow up, but I love young adult fiction. I am really pleased to find Sarah Dessen. This is the first book I've read of hers. The plot is simple enough, nothing totally original about the book. But the characters were written so that I really cared about them, and looked forward to ""spending time"" with them. I think it makes us look at real-life issues in a was that teens (and 20-somethings like me) can easily relate to. Death of a parent. Mother-daughter relationships. Boy-girl relationships. Girl-girl friendships, etc.I should mention there is a tiny bit of language (I think the f-word is used once or twice) and some underage drinking, which I do NOT like at all. But it certainly doesn't glorify it, just mentions it."
5,My favorite book during high school. BEST COMING-OF-AGE BOOK!,"This was my favorite book during high school, and I still to this day recommend it to everyone I meet. There are not enough words to describe just how great this book really is, and even so, words cannot do this book justice. Definitely the best coming-of-age book I've ever read, and when I have my own family in the future, it will be the first book I recommend to my daughter. (Yes, it is that good!)"
5,"Very, very good","I'm not going to spoil anything by writing the plot, but this book was AWESOME!! You could really feel what her characters were going through, and it was very realistic. I loved the back cover and the endless meaningful quotes sprinkled throughout the book! Chaos was good to describe the Wish crew because it was just what Macy and Jason weren't in the beginning. I really loved this ""coming of age"" novel, and all of you should read it!"
4,a good romp,"Who would think that two experimental poets could write a comic novel without stylistic pretensions? There's nothing profound here, just a quick read with plenty of laughs. The title conveys the substance fairly well: Schuyler and Ashbery have created a cast of middle- to upper-class fools for whom they have little respect. This could, of course, be fairly tiresome (""aren't the bourgeosie so silly!""), if it weren't for the authors' keen sense of humor. Think of this as a detailed pitch for a good Woody Allen movie, or a Firbank novel for the mid-twentieth century."
5,Auden was right,"This book deserves to be recognized as the ""minor classic"" W. H. Auden thought it was destined to become. The high camp of much of the proceedings only makes the book more profound in its investigation of the contemporary manners of negotiating affect through objects. In this it looks back to Wilde and Henry James, as it does also in its arch staging of the objectification of a mystified ""Europe."" Entirely fascinating, urbanely hilarious."
4,Thorough commentary of Markan Gospel,"This is a good and thorough commentary of the Gospel of Mark. The text does a fine job of mapping out the unique perspective of Mark, the characters within it and how conflict between characters gives rise to the intensity of the Markan Gospel. I liked the format of the book, which examined each critical character (Jesus, the authorities and the disciples)and their role at each phase of the Gospel text. As Kingsbury works through the Markan text, you can see the pattern of conflict between the ""things of God"" and the ""things of humans"".Overall, the book was an interesting read that I'm glad I have in my library."
4,Conflict in Mark,"Conflict in Mark is a great book for literary criticism for the Gospel of Mark. Kingsbury does a great job of describing the interaction of Jesus, disciples and the religious authorities with each other and what they communicate to the reader. Unfortunately with such a short book, Kingsbury leaves the reader wanting to know more. There is little or no explanation of minor characters, including the crowd, in their role in the Gospel of Mark. At times, Kingsbury can be a bit repetitive because he is dealing with the three characters repeatedly in each of the three chapters. Overall, it is a good book to begin studying the Gospel of Mark."
5,I'm reviewing mouthwash.....,"Given the opportunity to review mouthwash is awesome. Thank you Amazon.com. Because most people want to know if Mouthwash works. I mean if mouthwash doesn't work who will tell America (or the rest of the world) what is up. Next I'm gonna see if I can review Chereios. I hope so.....By the way this mouthwash is kinda of tough on the mouth and doesn't give one the Alchol Buzz, that Is really needed with a product like this. I'd try Peppermint Schanpps as an alternative."
5,I like the flavour,"Not much to say...I like the flavour. However it doesn't replace your tongue cleaner for fresh breath, which is pretty much the case with all the mouth wash. So it does what it is supposed to do. Produce good results if you use it after cleaning your tongue."
3,A Step Back?,"The earlier version of this label printer (KL-750) would allow you to print two lines on 9mm tape. This ""upgrade"" apparently does not. The 750 would automatically reduce the font size when you pressed the carriage return. I can't believe Casio would take away functionality like that. It can print two lines, but only on 12mm tape.At least the number of batteries required is down from 8 to 6 (AA), but the price of the adapter is absurd.Also, the space between labels is more like 1.5""!!! Ridiculous! You really notice when you print out multiple labels without cutting them. My son blurted, ""What a rip-off!""With the price of labels vs. the price of this printer after rebate, it's cheaper to buy a new printer after the labels run out.Despite these complaints, this is a very nice label printer. Better type and nicer labels than the Dymo I was using. It is also quieter than the 750."
1,Cafe del Nada,"Buyer beware - especially you CDM faithful! This disc has all the appeal of day old toast. The collection is unrelenting, one-dimensional, shrink-wrapped pop. The only things missing are commercials between each track! I'm dumbfounded that this disc carries the Cafe del Mar brand.I'll definately sail this one out the window."
5,Grapefruit extract,This is a quality product. Adds cleaning power and a nice clean scent to everything I have used it in. Works as an aid in disinfecting too.
5,"Final Doom, not dead","Legendary game, resurrected by programs like skulltag, and zdoom. If you love doom, get this and play it using zdoom or skulltag. Hours of fun, and highly addictive!"
1,Very Poor,The worst game ever. I know it says it has 3d grafics but thats a lie it has no grafics at all! !LOL! If you buy this game you are pretty stupid!
3,It's gettin' obsolete,"Doom is a killer game...Unfortunatly, after the coming of games like Duke Nukem 3D, Quake and Unreal, Doom seems a little, uhhh... old. Not to say it isn't fun! This game is hours of entertainment, it's just that after being able to jump, have more debris/ carnage, and voices in newer games, it leaves ""Doom"" in the dust. If you've never played this game (I.E. you've been in a coma), it's probably one of the best you'll ever come across... Doom is addictive, it's just that the standard for this type of game has been so very much improved!"
3,For DOOM lovers mostly,"With more advanced games out there like Duke Nukem 3D and Quake out there, this game won't be of much good for anyone but the most dedicated DOOM players. So unless you are DOOM lover, this is not meant for you."
1,Disappointed,I was really looking forward to receiving this item but am definitely disappointed. 7 outfits and I can't find one I'm interested in cutting out. There's just too little detail.The two depictions of Elizabeth flashing calf are a bit disturbing. Why is her calf larger than her head?This item would be OK if you're interested in a viewing a rough sketch of these very famous costumes.
3,They work a lot better if you don't drop them on a cement floor,"Guess how I know this? Whilst installing mine, it slipped through my fingers and fell to the floor and popped open. I carefully put all of humpty-transformer's pieces back together again but it didn't work right. However, seeing its little innards offered some additional info about its construction. This is an amazingly cheap little piece of merchandise.However, transformer #2 did not get dropped on the cement floor and seems to work better.The leads on this transformer are pre-stripped and ready to be hooked up and that's a bonus. Now that I'm becoming an expert in the installation of these transformers, I can tell you that they're easy to hook up and use."
4,Pentax SMCP FA-28-80 f.3.5-5.6 Lens,Did not recieve sliver lens. I received a black lens which is newer and better than the one showen in the picture. The lens works just great. Takes great pictures. Very pleased! Cambridgeworld and I work though our dispute. The owner is a customer service person who does not like an upset customer and will take that extra step to make things right. Will do business with both Amazon and Cambridgegworld again.Robert Holberg
5,bumping jams,i've always dug the dazz bands funk and this set points it into high gear.it's funky and has all the jams on here.
2,Nice idea but...,"None of these compositions is complete. Annoyingly short bliplins of disjointed wankery.There are a few little tidbits that stand out and really show the potential these cats have, but all of the compositions pull the rug out from under before anything really manifests."
5,"Brief biographies, basic history, and background music info","Compiled and organized by music critic and radio host Stan Jeffries, Encyclopedia Of World Pop Music 1980-2001 offers 277-pages of brief biographies, basic history, and background music information concerning modern pop music stars performing worldwide over the past twenty years. Appendix A lists entries alphabetically by country; Appendix B lists awards; and Appendix C explains silver/gold/platinum sales requirements. Extensively researched, offering web sites for quick lookup as well as more standard sources, Encyclopedia Of World Pop Music 1980-2001 is a welcome and information packed contribution to Popular Culture Music History collections, as well as an invaluable Songwriter/Performer reference."
4,"Lush, layered and lyrical","Granted if you buy this album looking for another KT Tunstall (in her Virgin years) you will be disappointed. However, if you like Folk music with a touch of Americana sung by a woman with a commanding voice, and you are not afraid to dig in and emerge yourself in some pretty layers of sound, I think this album is worth exploring. The delicacy of some of the arrangements may come off as ""boring"" or ""too slow"" to those quick to dismiss, but for those willing to enter Kristin Mueller's ""Home"", the delicacy invites an intimacy few singer/song writers achieve."
2,not for beginners,"Though I have read many good things about Living Language programs, ""Fast & Easy French"" does not provide the basic structure for beginners completely unfamiliar with the French language. It is not a good tool to use for anyone just learning French.As I listened to the CD, I was frustrated by how fast they went through the phrases. The lessons seemed more like a review of the French language. I'm sure someone familiar with French will find this book to be a useful refresher course.Coming from someone not familiar with French, I did not find this Booklet and CD very helpful. However, I will keep it to use as a refresher course once I learn French via another publisher."
4,A solid refresher!,"This audio CD cuts right to the chase for those of us who need a quick refresher course for what is often remnants of high school French. This CD assumes you've forgotten a lot and doesn't intimidate. The native French is slow and easy to understand. If you are looking for a quick and easy way to improve your French before a trip abroad, this is the CD for you. Btw, it also is truly hands-free audio learning and thus great for the car where you really can't be relying on a companion book."
3,"Great looks, not so great sound","I almost expected it to have a strange sound considering the fact that the pointed ends don't reverberate as well as a real semi-hollow. It also seems very sensitive to tuning, as in it goes out of tune easily and needs to be exact to sound right. I like the pickup pattern, two humbuckers with separate volume controls...it gives you more control of your tone. Overall, its not a bad guitar, but its nothing great."
4,Yoga Sutras of Putanjali great complement to my yoga practice,The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali has been a helpful tool in my exploration of the full yoga practice. To me yoga is so much more than just practicing the asanas. I found this book helpful in bringing yoga to my every day life on and off the mat.
4,Great translation,"This is a great translation of the sutras of Patanjali. However, I do wish there was more commentary on the later sutras by Sri Satchidananda. The beginning commentaries are excellent though and provide great insight into the text."
3,Sutras,"I find these Sutras to have too much interpretation, and not necessarily what was meant by Patanjali the author.I have studied the Sutras in the past with a teacher from India and the viewpoints were quiet different from Swami Satchidananda. Although, interpretation is necessary for us Westerners or anyone new to yogic philosophy to understand these teachings but I think after a certain level of studies with other teachers, one can see right through them and understand what this practice means for him or herself in their lives.If I had the choice I would have bought a different book on Sutras with less writing on each Sutras but this book was required by my school for yoga studies."
3,"Very detailed, but awkward language","In trying to present a very scholarly commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali the author goes into great detail to break down each sutra. The depth of knowledge is evident, however, the language strays into the pendantic realm and becomes rather cumbersome.There is a great deal of joy and beauty to be found in the Sutras, unfortunately Sri Swami Satchidananda's translations do not share this. Instead we are left with language that is clunky and heavy handed.Do buy this book to round out the many translations of the Sutras that are out there. There is a great deal of knowledge and love put into this book, however, do explore some of the other tranlations to provide a more rounded view of the Sutras as a whole."
5,Wonderful book!,"I enjoy reading this book! The author quite obviously knows what he is talking about. He gives wonderful explanations and provides insights to the Yoga Sutras. I am learning a great deal from his commentaries on Pantanjali's humanity-benefiting work.Thank you, Swami Satchinananda!"
1,Could it be more condescending?,"I have two other versions/interpretations of the yoga sutras. I was actually quit surpised by sutra 2 of this book. He refers to the ""chitta vritti"" as ""mind stuff."" Mind stuff? Please. How about a real explanation. Definately written for an American audience whom he regards as very simple. I read a couple more sutras but really couldn't take it as it was just ridiculous.If you are the type of person who would be happy being told that there is ""mind stuff"" taking place inside your brain and it is far too complicated for you to understand then by all means buy this book. Otherwise, try the Four Chapters of Freedom. It offers much more thorough explainations and it treats its audience with respect."
1,Only bought it because I had to,"I am taking yoga training that requires this book. I wasn't excited about buying it, but it was even worse than I thought. If you want the book, I'll be reselling mine as soon as the class is over. It has really deep thoughts - sutras like - ""An object is known or unknown dependent on whether or not the mind gets colored by it."" or ""The reality of things is due to the uniformity of the gunas' transformations."""
2,Yoga Sutras,"While the book itself is in good shape, it had writing in it in several places...would have liked to know that"
1,book fail,"unfortunately the book I ordered (used) fell apart after two days I had it, a bit disappointing. I ordered used not because of the price difference (hardly any), but because I don't like to consume. Maybe you should sell the used books a bit cheaper and not class them as ""in very good condition"", when they are not.Thanks,Tia"
5,great reading!,This is a great translation. It is good for reading one or two sutras with translation/comments daily. Spiritually very nourishing. I highly recommend it.
5,A Trustworthy Translation,"Satchidananda presents a warm hearted translation of this classic. It is saturated with the kindness, compassion,warmth, touching sense of humor, and open mind that define the truly spiritual. He draws from all religions, not seeing any one as better than the others; as is the case with all masters from every tradition, Satchidananda sees that ""the paths are many, but Truth is one."" He makes a good representative of Yoga and True Religion in general. I can't believe that no one else has reviewed this book already."
5,The Best!!!,"By far one of the best books on the Yoga Sutra's. Swami Satchidanda simplifies each sutra, making them easy to understand and apply to ones own life."
3,A loving husband,"I think every man or woman would kill for a spouse of partner who loved and adored us as much as Irving loved Jackie. But....in reading other reviews I agree that he did probably write the book in response to Barbara Seaman's research and biography on Jackie.It did however give an insight to the mutual pain that they felt over their son's illness and the lengths that they went to for him, which I think we all can agree was the great tragedy of Jackie's life, and probably Irving's. Barbara's book did discuss that at length but with Irving's you could feel the actual pain that only the two of them felt.Irving loved and adored his wife, and he felt she loved and adored him as well, and in the end she did, I think that that was the message he wanted Jackie's fans to get."
4,Handy and compact,I'm a contractor and carry small items. This bag has strong zippers and is easy to maneuver and holds quite a bit.
3,wrong book,"I guess I didnt read the description too carefully. WHat I was actually looking for was the actual prayer book that goes with this guide, so I had to return this. I guess if you have the prayer book and want to do more this may help you. I'd rather not write answers to questions about my relationship in a book though. I'd rather just pray about it."
1,Was not brand new as advertised,This item was advertised as brand new but several pages were written in which is disappointing. I did not want a used study guide.
3,This is the companion workbook...now I need the book.,I think this workbook will help me. I just need to order the actual book that this accompanies.
5,Great Book for all Wives!,"Excellent book for all praying wives. This book has enriched my life, my marriage, my prayer life tremendously. Wonderful book!"
4,Hilarious and Outrageous,"I laughed out loud and finished this book in one sitting! The authors assembled have tackled their task admirably -- imagining what it would be like to wake as a woman for one day -- and done so with humor, charm, and skill. There may be a misstep or two, primarily one-line ""poems"" masking as philosophy, but all-in-all this is a wonderful read for anyone with a sense of humor."
1,Useless,"I was hoping this book would have careful, thoughtful and interesting stories from men who would ponder life for one day as a woman. Instead, it is a collection of stories and poems of lame content and items of little interest to the subject matter. Very few of the stories actually DEAL with people transformed into what can be considered physically normal females! I was looking for gender based stories dealing with issue of how men think life would be as women. Perhaps the author would do better to ellicit help from transgendered men who spend the majority of their lives dreaming of what life would be like as a woman and could provide insightful stories of how men can really think of life as women and provide some respectful insight that women could review and discuss. I was horribly disappointed in this book and overall, it was probably the second worst book I have read in my distinguished reading career."
4,A Handy Kitchen Tool,"I did not purchase the product from this store, however I have the exact same one here at home that my mom gave to me the other day. This nifty little tool works like a charm, makes working with strawberries lots easier."
5,Exactly like my mom's,"I tried another one before I found this one again. The other one was pointier and didn't work as well. I love this one and you don't have to lose the whole top of the strawberry like you do when you slice off the top. This is definitely one of those oldies, but goodies!"
2,flimsy huller,"i bought this because it looked like the one my grandma used to have. ahhh, the good ol' days! i was sorely disappointed, as this one is made of really flimsy metal and it bends and collapses all crazy like. not very helpful at all. would love it if it was made of sturdier stock so i didn't feel like it would bend in half with the first berry..."
3,Seems pretty flimsy,I haven't put this to use yet but it seems pretty flimsy. I was hoping this would be like the one my Mom has but it definitely is not as sturdy. Maybe it will work ok . . . we shall see!
2,Like my old one but flimsy Fox Run Huller,Hard to use because of the thinness of the metal. Not as the one I had for years even though it looks the same in the picture. It bends very easily. I can still use it but I was disappointed at the quality. Read the other reviews looked at the card it came on. Mine is from Fox Run made in China!!
5,Complex reading Robert Shaw,"This book is only for the person wanting to learn ACM air combat maneuvering. I would only recommend this book to an actual pilot or someone deeply into simulation gaming. I absolutely love the book though. When you do read it, you have to give it 100% of your attention and must have some previous knowledge to ACM to completely understand what Robert is talking about."
5,Great Stuff for the Flight Sim enthusiast!,The quotes alone in this book is worth the money. And theres lots of them! With today realistic modeling of jets the tactics provide in this book give an edge over your opponents.
4,fighter combat,"Haven't had a chance to read it yet,but it looks like an exhaustive study of the subject."
4,a book of lists - a reference book,"The book offers a way to impose discipline on the entire software development process. It targets large software projects, where there are numerous programmers, and where the eventual code base might number millions of lines. The CMM may let you manage a scaling of effort that can yield a successful project, on time and on budget. No guarantees, mind you. But Carnegie Mellon's authors have extensively studied this field and their advice is generally considered sound.The text is deliberately written as a set of lists, where a list consists of tasks to be done. This is not a book you necessarily read for insight. A book of lists, come on! Rather, you have some experience with CMM, from other texts or live instruction. And you then use this book for specific tasks. This is a reference book, like a dictionary, if you will."
2,Excellent - but only for SCO. Often refers to the man pages.,"This is one of the few books that explores Unix kernel internals. Unfortunately, it is highly specific to the SCO version of Unix. The book constantly refers the reader to the system man pages for more information. Doesn't touch modern topics such as threads and multiprocessors. It also full of examples; but they use SCO specific examples and make extensive use of SCO utilities. And, many examples require root to actually run; otherwise you're limited to reading the excellent screen captures.If you do system programming for SCO, this is a must have (along with SCO's system documentation). If you're into many Unix(s) (Solaris, Linux, BSD, AIX, etc.) you'll be disappointed. I work with Solaris, BSD and Linux and am trying to decide to keep it for reference or return it."
5,Excellent thoughts for your golf game,This is a helpful book on keeping your head in the game. It should be read over and over again.
1,Flaky and deceptive,"Wow, all that delay and anticipation, to hear this long list of sometimes-rare ""selected works of Ennio Morricone film music,"" and it turns out to be tacky synthesized versions of his music -- OBVIOUSLY not arranged, composed, or conducted by Morricone himself. The original music from the Maestro is fine, indeed, but these ridiculous covers render it nearly impossible to discern that, especially if you've never heard the originals. And so the frustrating search continues for some ORIGINAL rare recordings. No doubt the makers of this material were well aware of the situation and more than willing to exploit in so cheap and shameful a manner. Maybe some people don't mind synthesized sounds; for me, it's an utter disappointment."
1,Film Music Fake,"I am sorry to say this is not the real thing. After downloading two MP3 songs it was obvious this is not the haunting brass and guitar movie music from Ennio Morricone we heard and loved. This is some one using a synthesizer in a poor attempt to electronically render it, and it certainly does not sound the same as the original. We can only hope someone actually puts together a true album of Ennio Morricone music with at least a true brass and guitar rendition rather than more fake remixes. You are better off gettingOnce Upon a Time... The Essential Ennio Morricone.CA Luster"
1,"By far, the worst book I've every read.","According to Wikipedia, Sanford was formerly an atheist, in the mid-1980s; then he and his present wife Helen went through a marital crisis, which strongly led him to becoming a born again Christian and a young earth creationist. That's great for John, but not for someone who buys this book, wasting their time and money, thinking it will be about ""entropy"" and the ""genome"". Really, an author should not use title and cover-design tricks to mislead people into thinking a book is about something it is not. If you want to write a book about how the good lord gave us the genome and that how the second law of thermodynamics can be found by plotting the descendents of Noah (in the bible) vs. life-span, then you should say that either on the front or back cover. Thanks for wasting my two hours of reading time and my money."
3,Has dated quite badly,"Originally a hit when released in the arcades in the 80's Spy vs Spy also enjoyed success on just about every home console. I myself had it on the Commodore 64 along with the sequel 'Island Adventure' and the third one called 'Arctic Antics', which were better.The trouble with the original Spy vs Spy is that the gameplay, while briefly fun, was too limited and the rooms of the big building you ran about in looked the same. It was easy to get lost and there was nothing particularly visually interesting about the game.But for Spy vs Spy or MAD Magazine completest this game is a must. I've yet to play the new Spy vs Spy game (it only came out on PS2 and XBOX-I have a Gamecube) but it will probably be better than this. If you have a vintage console at home then get Spy vs Spy II or III."
2,12 Gardens Live,"12 gardens live is a great CD for people who like hearing the same old songs from Billy Joel. There is some suprises, but it all sounds like the original recording.If you like to hear the hits, this is for you."
3,Who were the sound wizards who mixed this thing?,"Given the technology of today, one would think that a better mix could be done. The guitar and keyboard (synth) seem way too prominent and the piano almost seems to be hiding. I can deal with the rough voice in spots, and I can deal with the key changes...hey, we're all aging. I just find this disc a bit disappointing. I, too, prefer his original band. For those who criticize the song selection, he'd have to play a long time to make everyone happy. I thought it was a nice mix of popular and less popular tracks. Personally, I like ""You're My Home"", but I'm not going to crucify him for not playing it. I guess it's worth it for the low price, but I think it could have been better. It reminds me of the quick soundboard mixes some artists have taken to releasing of every live show they did."
3,"I was there, great songs not the best versions","I was there for one of those monumental 12 concerts in MSG, so I had to buy this the day it came out. I listened to it, and liked it because it brought me back to that amazing concert. But to be honest, his vocal performance isn't that great on some of the tracks. If your looking for great live versions, get his ""My Lives"" set. The live performances on that CD are AMAZING."
4,Review for 12 Gardens Live,"I have every single Billy Joel album, but I think this is among his best! Not only does it have his greatest hits, but it has some of his not so popular songs as well. What gets me every time I go to one of Billy's concerts is hot the audience knows EVERY word and every ohh and ahh. This is reflected on this CD when you can hear the audience singing along. That must be a gret boost to Billy Joel."
4,"Brought in the noise, left out the funk!","For anyone who can sing along to ""Vienna"", this is probably one of Billy Joel's Best offerings, in terms of live music. However, you don't shell out hard earned cash to hear Paul and Mindy from Levittown shrieking out in the distance, and blowing your speakers. This is precisely what the engineers did. While you can get away with dipping the final 2 EQ knobs to -13, the album has to be totally remastered, which is a shame, because the actual music on it is awesome. Songs in the Attic remains my favorite live album"
3,He doesn't sing some of the songs in the original key,"I've always been a big Billy Joel Fan... Have all of his albums...have seen him in concert 2 times.....but I'm sorry Billy....on this live album your voice just aint what it used to be. I prefer to listen to some of his original recordings when he still could sing the song in the original key. Example: Only the Good Die Young....he can't hit the high notes anymore so he sings it in a lower key now. ""Innocent Man"" is another....and the problem is that it's hard to capture the same energy that he had when he originally wrote many of the songs because...let's face it...Billy's much older now."
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this CD. The older Billy Joel isn't as fun to listen to live, I guess. I listened to it once and filed it away in my ""not played very much"" CD section. But when I bought it I only paid $9.99. So I guess it wasn't a total disaster."
4,Billy's Back,"If you like the ""old"" Billy Joel, you'll like this album. Good song selection, the voice is still there (unlike other recent concerts) and the band is terrific. We listen to it over and over; a very upbeat sound."
4,decent album (CD for you younguns),I gave the album to my niece for a b'day present and so far no complaints.
5,She' always a woman,"I have been to many of Joels' concert and never heard this song live, one of the most beautiful, written from the heart, heartbreaking songs ever made. I heard and have read that Joel did not sing this song any more because the reasons he wrote the song for weren't there anymore. So here it is...just because of its inclusion in this cd, its worth to buy it. This is a perfect collection of Joels' amazing songwritting carreer."
2,A bit outdated,"Being new to the world of Blackberries, I decided to pickup this book for some technical knowledge of the device. Unfortunately, in the world of technology, 3 years is a long time and much seemed not applicable to my Bold (9000). Many of the shortcuts were in the manual and some of them were not usable on the Bold. After the first couple of chapters I skimmed through and decided that maybe 1/3 of the book was relevant to what I was expecting. If you have an older Blackberry, perhaps you may find it useful but like other technical documents, 3 years old is just too old to keep up with the rush of new technology and new devices that pops up daily. *You may note that reviewers that gave the book high marks had reviewed the book close to its publication date."
1,Outdated information for 2009 Blackberry models,"I bought this hoping for a set of tips more tightly focused on the operation of the Blackberry OS and built-in applications. It turns out to be more of a compendium of 3rd party apps that you can access with your (older) Blackberry. It doesn't address the newer Blackberry models (Pearl, Curve, Bold, etc) as it was published in 2006 and has not been revised in the interim.I would not recommend this book unless you have an older Blackberry model. Hacks 94 to 100 do appear to be helpful introductory material if you want to develop your own Blackberry apps, though they aren't worth the cover price of this book. Look for a used copy if you must have it."
2,Nearly useless except for the lazy.,"I read some of the warning reviews but as they were directed at power users I thought they didn't apply to me. Wrong! Having bought a Blackberry Pearl and wanting something to bring me up to speed on the Blackberry operating system with some nifty tricks, I was sorely disappointed. There are no real hacks in this book. It is mostly a long compilation of 3 party software available on the web in many cases out of date. Most of the tricks shown are so obvious that I had already figured them out such as how to hide an Icon. How to make your own autotext entries etc. Skip this book unless you want a very bland overview of what you can do with your blackberry. Don't expect any inner secrets to the os to be revealed to you."
3,Not for the power user,"Had I read the intro section about what is considered a ""hack"" for the purposes of this book (in a series of similar ones), I may have had second thoughts about purchasing it. Doesn't take much to qualify as one, apparently. As a result, the book is really a very nicely made operations manual, repeating lots of already documented BB functions with a few of not-so-well-known tricks thrown in. For the power user, I saw only a couple of things I hadn't known about before. Super for the beginner, good for the everyday user, nothing new for the power user."
5,Blackberry Hacks,"Very good book, a must have for all blackberry addicts.The book has lots of useful insights on configuring the 7100,and 72xx series blackberry and BES infrastructure."
3,what we already knew as 1st graders,"This is what we were all supposed to learn by first grade elementary school. The book shows that these values do not change with time and place.This is a very good ""coming of age"" gift for all young people, as well as an excellent gift for adults who may have forgotten the basic rules."
2,Light on substance,"While it was a good reminder, it really didn't tell you much. No insight. Jon points out things we should already know. You can read the title and get what you want from the book.I like to see the positive in things so, for someone who already does these things it is just a reminder, for someone who doesn't it may start them. Again not very substantial, was hoping to get new insight."
3,"Interesting, yet lacking","I thought Christmas in Purgatory was interesting, but it lacked depth. The photographs told the story, as did the brief essay, but instead throwing out all those quotes from historical figures, the authors could have given more information, such as biographical information on the patients, histories of some of the institutions (without naming them of course), statistics such as lifespans of patients in the backwards photographed, as well as more feedback from staff. Some of this information might not have been obtainable, but the authors could still have gone more in-depth rather than include all those quotes."
2,A bit dissapointed...,"I received the scrapbook a week before christmas and I was so excited. I thought it would of showed pictures of how they made the mummy... maybe a couple of pictures and about the CGI and everything but it only did a resume about the movie ""The Mummy"" and say a couple of egyptian facts here and there. Also, I only found 1 quote from an actors point of view (from Arnold Vosloo) in this VERY THIN scrapbook of 48 pages and they didn't even write his name right! His pictures were sexy but they could of embellish this book with a bit more information and quotes from the actors themselves..."
3,You get what you pay for,"This was a great deal for a flag... You really cannot beat the price. However, you get what you pay for. The material is the cheapest of cheap for flags. One day out in the sun and wind would probably destroy it. Also, the colors were off on the flag... there was a good deal of pink on the flag. where it should have been red or gold. I wont rate it lower because the price is ridiculous. However, if you want to display this anywhere but your room, get a nicer flag"
2,Overall weak but mildly entertaining,"If you're a horror junkie and have flexed your netflix account so far you've seen nearly every movie that people have heard of, this movie is worth your time. Its not by any means a good movie, but its not bad either. In short, a group of high school kids decide to ditch a dance and hang out at a supposedly nefarious apple orchard, only to find out that it is, in fact, nefarious. There's absolutely nothing new about the story, and it was pitifully predictable. The acting was so so, but the acting of the guys was especially bad. But...the production values were pretty good; it did not feel like a low budget flick (which it is) and the camera work and lighting were generally good. Despite the weak acting and awful story/dialogue, there was something entertaining about the movie. Again, there are scores of movie that merit attention far before this one, but if you've worked through those already, you won't necessarily be disappointed."
4,An Encounter with a Prophet,An insiteful book but I paid way to much for it. I am definitely into spirituality but feel this book came up somewhat short for me personally.
5,Really really Good,"I am a 16 year old female and my parents would kill me if they knew I had read this book. But Church made me feel dirty, guilty. This book tells me God loves me just the way I am right now.Get the book. Get coipes to sneak to your friends who have religious parents."
4,Thought provoking,"The book is well written. The book is thought provoking. It allows you to see God in different light. I do not agree with everything in the book. However, this does not mean that one should rule out reading and close ones mind to it. There are many concepts that I agree with such as doing things for unselfish reasons and do not put your faith in a denomination but in God. However, there are questions that I have. I cannot believe everything in the book."
5,Reevaluate your Beliefs,"This book made me reevaluate my views on everything I had been taught. I can't look at a situation or interact with people the same way anymore. I have to stop and evaluate them in a new way. If and only if they need it, how can I help them learn about a God of unconditional love. This thought seems to be with me all the time.This is how the book changed me. I hope you get the same benefits."
2,An Encounter with a Prophet,The book does not meet my expectancies and the price is over valued. Is just a small soft cover book priced at $149.00. Nevertheless I received an adjustment of $100.00 in the price when I informed about it.
4,What's in an name...er - inititial,"In response to the curious reader regarding C. Lewis' creditials they are J.D. (Doctorate of Law Degree), MHR (Master of Human Resource degree) and QMHP (Qualified Mental Health Professional).While not terribly earthshattering or in-sight producing - it is interesting."
1,"An easy message, doesn't mean it is true.","(...) All we need is material telling teenagers that their actions have no serious consequences in God's vision.(...) it was o.k. to read, obviously not intended to be great literature, just a small book with a message. But clearly the message is wrong, even perverse in places. It's an easy message to accept, since we'd like to be free of judgement for our actions. If you believe that, you'll relate to the book, if not you won't."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The initial reviews for this book encouraged me to buy it, but don't waste your money. It appears to be a self-published work and poorly done at that. The editing errors alone keep me from taking it seriously. Furthermore, the writing is stilted and lacks cohesion. The writer's background knowledge is narrow and lacking in deep concepts. It should be read as fiction, not as self-improvement and absolutely not as a serious spiritual awareness book. I was completely disappointed in the waste of time and money I put into it. For those who thought it was wonderful, I suggest you read Tolle or Walsch for something solid and well written."
5,"Life changing, spiritual truths","No other author has ever dared to present such profound and life changing, spiritual truths in such a simple and straightforward manner - truths I've always felt from deep within but which I dared not accept or believe.The author's logic is so clear and convincing, his conclusions are so powerful and sound. He has in fact made it difficult for his critics, all those frightened souls dependent on the religion handed down to them by their ancestors, to attack what he says directly, so they have resorted to attacking his writing style. Incredible!I have never found anything so beautifully written, and so clear and simple in its presentation. Read the book, if you are open to living truth, it will change your life."
5,An Explanation to Bible Contradictions,Finally a book that explains the questions of modern day spiritualists who believe in a Loving God who is all things good and pure...not a punishing jealous God of the Old Testament. This is a book that conveys clear information regarding long held questions of today's religions and of our innate spirituality. Gone are the contradictions. Definitely a must read for the independent thinker. A book of great comfort.
1,Read instead the truths found in God's Word,"Do not know where author gets his info,but he attempts to disclaim an interpretation that ""God sends people to hell because of imperfection."" All the Bibles I have ever read say instead that people are sent to hell ONLY because they reject His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ....not because we are sinful.It appears Lewis has never read God's Word? John 3 clearly tells us how to go to heaven.I call this book a ""pooling of ignorance."" I agree with Rom. 1:22 ""Professing to be wise, they became fools.""C. Lewis attemps to rewrite the Bible, as this book is anti-Biblical and is half-truth, at best."
1,encounter with a prophet,"Get real, this book is a joke.If you need to read this book to get spiritual. Lets get real, the only book you need is the Good Book. God does not come in your back pocket."
1,"Promotes Homosexually for teens; in guise of""spiritual"" book","Don't waste your money. A poorly written, self-published with stilted writing lacking cohesion and totally lacking in deep concepts. Parents should know that it includes a section condoning homosexual experimentation for teenage boys. Read any of the classics for truth."
1,Didn't fulfill its purpose.,"As an agnostic, this book is supposed to help me find answers to the questions and such, right?Well, it didn't. It didn't even come close.Next question?"
1,With great disappointment -,"I made the mistake of purchasing this book for a friend needing spiritual guidance. It is unfortunate that Lewis does not have a grasp on rightly dividing the word of God. Hopefully he will grow to understand that IT IS A LOVING GOD that gives us eternal life by way of His Grace. I was disappointed in his discounting the gospel of Paul (after all, gospel means the word of God). Anyone who reads Encounter with a Prophet should read Romans through Philemon in the King James Version of the bible to get the truth. There are some good points to this book, however I feel it is misguiding to anyone seeking a factual, Christian understanding."
1,Most Positive Reviews Seem Bogus,Most of the positive reviews for this book come from people who have never reviewed or commented on any other book on Amazon. The positive reviews all say about the same things and seem to be written by one person.
2,non sequitor,"Folks, I have read this book and I have to say that virtually all of the reviews since 1999 sometime, look to have been written by the same person. Is there some cult-type movement afoot to try and maintain interest in this thing? Surely there are thinking folks out there who see this as it really is - which is a sincere effort to state some religious concepts in a way that makes them appear ""new"" but which metaphysicists have kown for centuries. Try some Science of Mind by Ernest Holmes to see these ideas fleshed out."
5,Simple Love Spoken Here,"Just finished this book and found it full of spiritual pleasure for me.I have long thought of God and Jesus as all-loving.I find a lot of what I feel is mean-spirited in the bible. I Have always thought the Bible was written by men, men that liked to control what we believed. We are given free choice to see God as a loving God or one that punishes us for being human."
5,tha tightest ishh you'll ever hear,"this cd is my favorite because short nitty ,techn9ne,Bakarri,Big Scoob,and Txx Will knows how to rock da shows.venomous rap styles and hella talent by these heartless insane ghetto hoodlums.I stay on tha 5block and I'm here to represent.I recommend this cd to pandemic world. much luv , wraggs2riches jeffwraggs@hotmail.com"
5,This little pamphlet was a huge help,My experience with microsoft publisher was limited at best. This little pamphlet was perfect for me. It had everything I needed to know to get our club's newsletter up and running within a few days.
1,Not recommended,Perhaps okay for a total novice but anyone interested in using Publisher isn't a novice. I think I did read this was meant as a teaching aid/textbook which I didn't think of as a negative. WRONG!
2,Microsoft Publisher 2003 Quick Source Guide,I don't think I am advanced enough to use this. I needed very simple help. i have not used this publication
1,You might as well live in the middle of the sahara,"Listen, If you want to live in the mountains in the middle of a pine forest, then the only defense is to cut down all the folliage within flames distance of your home. You will then be living on the side of a barron mountain. This is like writing a book about buying home in the Outer Banks of North Carolina and how to extract water from the basement after the next hurricane. The best defense is replacement insurance."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the synopsis and reviews, I was excited about reading this book. The book itself, however, was a letdown.On the plus side, the author seems genuine and enthusiastic. On the negative side, the book doesn't really have much content of value in it.The pictures and drawings are cute, but not useful. The philosophy espoused is simplistic. The writing style is average at best.I was hoping for Thoreau crossed with the Whole Earth Catalog. This is far from that."
1,I would have given it ZERO if Amazon let you give 0's,"I actually have own Dan Price's other book re. Journal making. How to Make a Journal of Your Life, I must own an earlier version because the current cover on Amazon is not what I own.Back to Radical Simplicity, the guy lives in a hole. Unless you want to live in a hole find another book to buy. Try 'The Confederacy Of Dunces' that'll make you happy your alive. When I'm dead I'll live in a hole, why get used to it now.Dan"
1,Radical-less Mediocrity,"Dan Price sounds like the kind of guy I'd like to have beer or who might make a fun neighbor, especially if you're a twelve year-old, but his book offers very little in the way of adult inspiration or creative vision. It fails to insight possibility beyond the mundane and too often dregs up self-indulgence and petty distraction. There is a huge difference between bold simplicity and creative aimlessness. This book dwells in the latter. If you want a 15 minute distraction, this book is nice. If you're wanting inspiration toward a life that is radically authentic and enriches your soul and those around you, start your search somewhere else and save your money."
2,dissapointed,"Not to take anything from the authors experiences which were pretty fantastic, but they weren't anything that I could relate to, or very little. I wish the description of the book had been a little clearerabout that and I probably would not have bought the book. If you want to read about a man whose life was an adventure, I would recommend this book.If you are looking for tips on simplifying your own life, not so much.There were some things, but not many."
4,Don't Need A Plane Ticket,"First Scotland, then Egypt. I enjoy traveling to foreign lands. The graphics were attractive, as both the mansion in Scotland and the hotel in Egypt had me feeling as if I were actually there. The music score was appropriate and especially lovely once I entered the tomb in Egypt. Puzzles were challenging but not impossible to solve.I was mildly disappointed that I couldn't explore the rest of the mansion and other cabins on the ship, even if they weren't important to the game. Because of the lovely graphics, I yearned to see more.I expect to see future Cameron Files with perhaps a more rich and interesting story line and more exploration possibilites."
2,I Couldn't Even Play These Games,"For the first time in my life, I actually got motion sickness due to playing a video game! I think it's the way the cursor jerks around in this game - I'm not too sure. But, within about 5 minutes or so of playing, I began getting the same symptoms I get with car sickness - the queasy stomach & an inability to focus my eyes.Because others may be sensitive to this as well, I thought I should write a review describing my experience..."
3,A decent basic scanner for older computers,"I've had this scanner for 6-7 years and it's worked great. The image resolution was good for the time I got it, but low by today's standards. For web use though, the image resolution is still more than you likely need. For posting old family snapshots online with a Win XP or older system, this scanner will treat you well.The major problem with this scanner is the lack of driver support for Windows 7. It appears to be HP's way to get us to upgrade perfectly working equipment with new HP equipment. This scanner was good until the lack of Win 7 support, but all other HP hardware I have owned has been junk that falls apart within months of purchase. It's highly unlikely that I'll purchase anything from HP in for foreseeable future."
3,OK Game,"It looks cool,but I'm a World Superbike fan.It dosen't have my favorite track which is Monza and I'm not that big of an AMA fan."
5,An Absolute Delight,"I was lucky enough to have Rom Harre teach me, using this book as the main text. The book's organization and easy-to-grasp, engaging explanations will give the reader a good understanding of a hard, yet fascinating topic. Buy it, even if you don't think you're smart enough to understand the most complex machine in the (known) universe; you'd be surprised what a good teacher can do."
5,Imperial Future,Knight's novel is a brilliant blend of reality and imagination. Character development is richly textured and his descriptive prose paints a vibrant texture that will stay with the reader long after reading the novel. The potential for Islamic cultural influences on very familiar popular cultural scenes is elegantly framed and cleverly nuanced leaving one with the sense of being wrapped in a world of the imminently possible rather than being in just an idiosyncratic world of a remarkably creative imagination. This book is a hidden gem that both shares and inspires new visions of tolerance and acceptance amidst the blood and gore found in the realities of recent American imperialism.
1,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed when I recieved this ring. While the stone was very nice, the setting looked very cheap and flimsy. There just was not enough gold thickness anywhere and it looked like it would be very easy to bend or be damaged in everyday wear. Besides getting bent, I would worry that the stone might pop out of this setting too easily as well because the supports for the stone were not very substantial either. While the price of this ring was reasonable for the size and quality of the diamond, I really think a much better quality setting could have been used to hold the lovely stone-the setting cheapened the whole look of the ring. This ring was pretty to look at but I would be afraid to actually wear it!"
1,loving every minute with it!!,For my first glass piece this is well worth the price. I would highly recommend this product to a friend(actually I already have)!
1,"Good film, terrible rental option on Amazon","The rental/streaming version of this is an old VHS pan and scan abomination. There is a correct DVD version available, even a slightly cropped HD version for television broadcast floating around. Ridiculous in this day and age to rent a film and get a pan and scan version."
4,Refreshing Original Songs,"1.Know You Better: Contemporary song blends in perfectly with the current playlists on the radio, lyrics speaks to ambivalence in young adult relationships. Catchy tune, keeps you humming it all day. Sounds a bit like Natasha's or Aly and AJ's music. Great first effort.2. I Quit: Lyrics crack me up every time I hear them, are fitting for something your doing every day when you just want to quit some boring project, job, school, relationship.When I first heard Ayla was singing a song entitled ""I Quit"" it confused me how someone so focused and passionate about school, music and basketball would find a use for those words. You really have to check out this song because it fits so well and makes sense when you hear it. Even though the song is about breaking up the refrain is so catchy you can't help applying it to other aspects of life. Kinda like a JoJo song. Great melody. Ayla is on her way.Looking forward to the orchestra version of the song Forward."
3,"Not bad, not fantastic","This CD is alright, but citing a previous review, it's definately slanted more towards DEP than In Flames or The Haunted. However, its nowhere near as good as those bands. Pretty good music for the most part."
5,Best metal/hardcore/etc. album this year.,"This does NOT sound like Groundbreaking Ceremony. This CD is sort of like a fusion between Himsa, In Flames, The Haunted, with a ever so slight touch of D.E.P. VERY well done music. Amazon should really get some sound clips up. This is easily the best metal CD I've bought all year."
5,decent...,"Hmmm... I heard about himsa when i saw them with underoath & atreyu--all bands are amazing but himsa was my favorite out them all. I quess its an decent album over-all specialy track 3 & 5... If you into pure metalcore with an difirent style--buy himsa's ""courtin tragety & disaster"" its well worth it! Himsa is pretty amazing live too...I might add!!"
3,movie was cool how ever the company i got it from sucks!!!!!,Please all who will buy anything please read company rateing it sucks and they do i;m not the only one who had a problem with them so if your smart stay away from this company the name is 2dollarmusic dont take my word for it read what others have said .sad thing this company doesnt even care about its customers so look them up before you buy from them !!!!!.hope i save someone from a bad dealing with company (BEWARE) BILL
3,Insider's opinion,"Have not seen the movie but was part of the cast during filming. From what I've seen, looks like an interesting story. Really hard to tell, as scenes are not shot sequentially. Shot primarily at the Mescal set of Old Tucson Studios. I am supposed to be billed as The Mexican."
3,Serves the purpose,"I had a very hard time deciding on what trailer to get to tote my 3 and 1 year old sons in behind my bike. We decided on teh WeeRide Stage Coach Double. When taking only one child on a ride it is perfect. The five point safety system holds them securely in place. When taking both boys on a ride they must be cramped. It is fun at first and then one kid will touch the other and oh boy look out. They do both stay in place, but when we take corners the bump into one another. I am sure this would be a problem with any trailer fit for two. It is super easy to attach to my bike, which I love. So, if I do go by myself its not a pain to take the trailer off and on again and again. We do enjoy the pouches to store small toys for the boys to play with while on the ride. It is a great buy for the price."
1,Do Not Buy,"We bought this bike trailer at the end of march to haul our 3yr old and 1 yr old. It was a little tight for them, but it worked, and didnt cost 400+ like the trailers in the bike shop. Today I was taking the kids for a ride and the trailer broke off at the spring area of the hitch, the cloth strap then aparently ripped off and the trailer detached and left the kids behind. Luckily I wasnt going very fast at the time and the trailer wasnt able to completely get into the roadway. If you already own this, look inside towards the spring area, there is a small black pastic piece, this is what broke on mine and left the kids behind."
1,"nice trailer, but support from company is poor!","The trailer is fine, but dont expect to be able to get any replacement parts, as Kent Bicycles (the importer?) doesnt stock any parts and cannot get them. This makes this trailer somewhat of a throwaway, as it is useless if a part breaks. Also, you cannot get extra axle mounts for additional bike, and have to mess with swapping the axle mount every time you want to tow with another bike. This is frustrating, as I tow when its a family ride, but my wife pulls if it is just her and our son. Bottom line is that I would buy a Schwinn or other name brand next time for the extra $20 or so to get better parts availability and support."
2,Not enough room for twins :(,"I bought this trailer for my twins but there just wasnt enough room. At the time they werent even a year old, we were going to save it for next year but even at that young age they were practicaly sitting on top of each other. Seemed great for one kid but if you have twins, youre just going to return this...."
1,Do NOT buy this trailer!,"This trailer has a hitch that holds the trailer to the chain stay tube of a bicycle, and it has a safety strap in case the hitch slips. The problem is that both the hitch and safety strap are attached by the same nut and bolt. The hitch has slipped during use before, so the strap is vital. The nut came off on ours, and we were lucky to notice before the hitch came undone. This could potentially cause serious injury or even death. I contacted Kent bicycles, the manufacturer, and they said there's nothing wrong with this design and they ""stand by"" it, and if I didn't feel safe to use it, I should leave it in my garage."
4,can't go wrong,"This is the kind of movie that's almost impossible to dislike. It's a very lighthearted, touching, funny film with great acting. Some parts are borderline cheesy, but they are very few and very bearable. The casting is spectacular and Darin (Nine Queens-another great movie) is such a pleasure to watch. It'll make you laugh, cry, think...it's good entertainment. Not in the same league as my favorite foreign films (like Central Station, Amores Perros) but an undoubtedly enjoyable movie."
5,Wonderful!,A rollercoaster between deep drama and laughter. Unbelievable example of the wonderful mix of Spanish and Italian cultures that dominate in Argentina. Absolutely loved it!
4,Excellent slice of life from Buenos Aires 2001,"""Son of the Bride"" surprised me - I was leery of a maudlin look at Alzheimer's and its impact. You know, a standard ""Movie of the Week"" treatment. Instead, this is a great look at one family trying to survive in the economic maelstrom that is Argentina, circa 2001. The tough economic conditions pressure Ricardo Darin's Rafael throughout the first third of the movie. It builds and builds to a crescendo. He spends the last hour+ trying to pick up the pieces.The movie never feels contrived or forced. The translation is crisp and not overwhelming. The sound quality is excellent - all of the dialogue can be heard, replete with that distinctive Argentinian accent.Although Darin is excellent here, I've got to think that this movie will long be remembered as Natalia Verbeke's stunning debut. Try keeping your eyes off this girl whenever she's on the screen. Simply luminous."
5,haiku gem,"Lee Gurga follows the tradition of Japanese haiku sometimes like Basho, sometimes like Issa. He not only describes the so-called haiku moment, but also illustrates his insight in the shortest form of poetry. In this collection, readers will see scenery in the Midwest captured dynamically and domestic life captured with watchful eyes and a warm heart. His essay on haiku at the end of the book will help people to understand the beauty of haiku and how Gurga uses his brushstroke. Recommended to all poetry lovers."
2,"Love Knipfel, don't love this book","To be honest, I haven't finished the book. About halfway through I put it down and haven't had the desire to pick it up again. I loved Knipfel's ""Slackjaw"" and ""Quitting the Nairobi Trio, so when ""The Buzzing"" came out I ordered it immediately and dove into it. It was an interesting premise but it just wasn't going anywhere for me. I found that after reading half the book I still didn't care that much about the characters, nor did I care to see how the big conspiracy got resolved. I love memoirs and I love Knipfel's memoirs and essays. I think his writing style is perfect for that genre, but it doesn't necessarily translate well to traditional fiction. For those who didn't like ""The Buzzing,"" try reading his other two and you may be pleasantly surprised."
4,The Walker Percy of Conspiracy,"This is a gorgeous, funny and devastating novel about conspiracies, loneliness and a quest for meaning in an increasingly chaotic world. Read it."
2,Stick with his memoirs,"I really enjoyed Jim Knipfel's Ruining it for Everybody, and have recommended it numerous times. But I just couldn't get into this book. After numerous attempts, I finally put it down.The main character is obviously Jim Knipfel, but the story is just not entertaining or engaging."
3,"A good ""read"" but hardly ""literature","The Buzzing is an entirely quirky work of tentitively comedic Science Fiction more than anything else. If you're really out of ideas for things to read and you're up for a story about a ""has-been"" newspaper reporter with psycholigical problems that don't lead to much, this is a fun story, but know what you're getting into."
5,Great for ESOL teachers of ALL ages!,"As a high school English teacher, this book is great for ESOL students. I have several ESOL students, from A1's on up to those who understand a little English but completely unable to write English. This is a great book for those students as it helps them with guided reading as well as provides short passages that the student can (using a translation dictionary or direct instruction or both) work. There are great questions that go with the stories to help with comprehension. A+"
1,NEW LIZ MCGRATH?!,"I've been a fan of Ms. McGrath for years (since Cencor This),so i was excited to hear about a new project she was working on. Fans of Tongue should avoid this, though. McGrath's abilities are extremely limited by the material, weak, corny lyrics, painfully simplistic music and a cheezy attempt to build the album around two imaginary characters (1920's bank robbers?). Tongue was tongue in cheek good fun, Miss Derringer is just a miss."
5,Great book for bot experienced and inexperienced bakers!,I lost my 1st Bread Machine Magic book which was very helpful and full of great ideas so when it became necessary to replace it with a good bread machine book. I naturally looked into the newly revised edition and genuinely believe that it is even better than before. It is packed with information and tips plus some of the best tested recipes you will find anywhere.
5,My favorite bread machine book,"My mom had this book and I had copied so many recipes out of it, I finally just had to buy my own. She is on her second copy. This is hands down my favorite bread machine book. The Sunday Morning Apricot Bread, Apple Butter Wheat, Onion Soup Bread, Sauerkraut Rye...all big winners. The garlic-cheese rolls should be illegal. Fluffy, light, buttery...mmmmmm.PS My loaves have never collapsed or been overly salty (and I'm sensitive to that), but they do require a bit more flour. This is probably due to my machine and not the recipes, which are well-tested."
5,"Bread Machine Magic, Revised Addition","The cookbook is lovely...I already had the original edition...and this new edition allows for our now larger 4-cups-of-flour 2-lb. loaves....but with all the same wonderful recipes as in the original! After using the original edition....I gave away all(and that was many!) my other bread machine books. I also bought the new edition for my cousin, as she always loved my recipes from the original edition. And, as always, Amazon.com is the best! Always find what I want and more....not to mention the wonderful service. I just love Amazon.com! Judy J., Gresham,OR."
5,great book,"We have made many of the breads in this book, and they are wonderful. We have only had minor problems with one or two recipes, and they were easily fixed using the trouble shooting section. It has a nice variety of types of breads, so you can make a little bit of everything."
1,huge dissapointment,"i searched for a bread machine book and picked this one based on ""reviews"", so i hope people give my review more scrutiny than i gave the others. the first recipe that i followed ""to a t"" was a disaster. it was like soup. the recipes are not precise, and the one i used only called for 1 1/2 cups of flour. also, the liquid amounts are too variable and asks you to add more water or flour during the process after checking on the dough consistency, in other words you can't just leave the machine to perform by itself. Most recipes in the book have the same unprecise amounts. the book didn't cost that much and it's more problem to return it than what it is worth."
3,Farmhouse Pumpernicel recipe not in revised version,I have used the original Bread Machine Magic and when doing an internet search for a 2 pound Farmhouse Pumpernickel recipe it showed the Revised edition of Bread Machine Magic. I purchased the book and NO recipe. I appreciate the fact that most recipes call for common ingredients found in the local grocery store.
5,If you own a bread machine--buy this!!,"I got this book a few weeks ago to accompany the bread machine I got for Christmas. It is outstanding! I have made about ten of the recipes so far, and I haven't been dissapointed with any of them. My favorites are: Heavenly whole wheat, cinnamon buns, calzones, Sally Lunn bread. Terrific recipe book."
3,Better for advanced users,"Helpful, but print is small and hard to read. Recipes have too many variables, and ingredients are not listed in order of how to put them in your machine. I like it, but I only found a few recipes in it I really use."
5,Excellent for first time bread machine users,"I considered a lot of books when I bought my Mini-Zo breadmaker and chose this one based on reviews. It was an excellent choice. I have had both for at least six months now. This book has a wide variety of recipes and helps you get started, learning to follow directions. Then you can branch out with some creative additions, once you get your confidence. Each recipe is given for three sizes of loaf, so it is perfect for the Mini-Zo, which makes a one-pound loaf. It has a lot of rye bread recipes, so if you like rye, even better. But if you don't, like me, there is still plenty to choose from. I make notes in the book on each recipe as I make it so I can remember how it turned out, and tab the ones I like with sticky notes. Buy it -- you'll like it."
5,Great Bread Machine Book,I really love this book. It is an update to the original title from several years back. The authors are very thorough and offer suggestions throughout the book to help make perfect breads. Just follow the guidelines and you will be amazed at the results as I have. I highly recommend this book for anyone serious about the art of breadmaking.
5,Really a good buy,I have 2 bread machine recipe books and i use this one the most. It has all you need to make really good bread. Other books have more detailed recipes for making more complex recipes but you will keep going back to this one for the basics plus some really tasty ideas when you get your feet under you.
4,These bread recipes are pretty tasty!,"I ordered this bread machine cookbook, to go along with my Zojirushi 1 lb bread machine. The only thing (so far) I don't like about it is... there are a few recipes that say to use the rapid bake cycle if using the 1 lb. machine. This produces an ""okay"" loaf, but I much prefer the texture of the bread, using the normal cycle.I'm not sure why they couldn't adjust the ingredients so that the bread wouldn't rise too high in the smaller machine, but for whatever reason, they didn't.I'm still experimenting with rapid rise yeast, versus active dry... etc.All in all, the flavor of the breads I've made (about 4, so far) has been very good."
5,my favorite bread cookbook,"I'm on my second bread machine, having worn out my first, but I'm still using this cookbook. I love the variety of breads. Everyone loves plain white bread fresh from the oven, but they also love sweet breads, whole grain breads, vegetable breads, rolls, fresh pita bread and all types of sweet rolls. This cookbook has something for everyone.A word about how the recipes are written....they do list a range of amounts for the liquid in each recipe. This allows the recipe to be used in many different machines. My old machine always needed the higher amount of liquid specified, but my new machine does better with the minimum amount. It may look a bit tricky, but if you try out a few recipes and check the dough as it is kneading and adjust the liquid accordingly, you should be able to figure out what part of the range your machine is in, and use that info for all the recipes in the book. I have been using this book for 10 years and haven't gotten tired of it yet."
5,US/Iraq & Israel/Palestine Conflicts Explained in Bible!,"INCREDIBLY EYE-OPENING AND EXTREMELY RELEVANT!I have read hundreds of books on the End-Times and Bible Prophecy. Never have I read one with such amazing insight and yet so relevant. This book has taught me that the end-time prophecies have a very realistic way of unfolding within our midst and that the current situation in the Middle East, especially concerning the US/Iraq and Israel/Palestinian Conflicts are right out of the pages of Scripture. People who are seeking the TRUTH and want to know how God is at work in our very midst need to not only read this, but get it into the hands of everyone imaginable! God is using a relatively unknown student of His Word to Wake Up His Church, which is just like God. ... This book is sure to make an incredible impact on the Body of Christ!"
5,My kids love it!,"My youngest daughter is always begging her older siblings ""play a board game with me."" Now she can play a ""board game"" anytime she wants too! These games are true to the originals and have great graphics. We are going to order the ""Clue"" set next!"
3,Okay game...,"Not the most exciting selection of games ever, but it has still provided hours of fun for my kids."
4,Bought 4 me and my 6 yr old plays it.,I bought this game for me to play and my 6yr old gets more play out of it then I do. He loves playing Battleship!!!!!!!!
5,4 Games in One!!!,"These games are very close to the original board games. I really enjoy playing them when I am somewhere that I have to wait, I just pull it out of my purse and play. It is nice to have a choice of games in just one cartridge."
3,Ok kind of games,i bought this by looking into that one disk 4 games. But the games are ok kind not very good.
2,board games are fun when you play with others,"My son loves board games.I bought this game so we can play together when we travel,but to make people buy another game they didnt have this option on the same machine.this is ridiculous.Do I have to buy another nintendo ds to be able to play with him."
4,gift,this was a gift for a pre-teen and seems seems to like it .has played it several times with no problems
3,Battleship is as good as ever,Battleship is great. Connect 4 has one big issue - the gamepiece sometimes drops in the wrong place. Otherwise it is a fun game and extremely difficult to win unless you are patient.
3,bATTLESHIP/cONNNECT 4 /sorry/trouble,"This game is another 4 ib 1 DS game of the 3 I already own,I would say that it is very good for a traveling game because you don't have the mess that comes along w/ board games,also it is in a compact lil disc so it isn't bulky and a room hogger like 4 board games would be,I like battle ship and connect 4 but found Sorry and Trouble to last way to long,I mean ubless I'm traveling in a car from Maine to Florida this wouldn't be my game choice,but then again it is good to have 4 games for the price of 1"
2,Wished multiplayer was better.,"I like the variety of the games in this pack, several choices for only $20. I read a few other reviews before I purchased this and figured their bad reviews of multiplayer options was something I would be able to deal with. I decided: you really need to buy two games in order to play these games against another player. Each game has a multiplayer option, but you can not use them without multiple game packs. Make sure anyone else that has a DS that you might want to play gets a game pack too."
3,Could have been better.,"I enjoy the simplicity of board games from time to time. The ds versions hold true to the originals. I give it four stars for fun since I've already played these games growing up and now I'm happy I can play them on the go.It should be noted the games' graphics are generally mediocre overall, but pretty poor in Sorry -- the cards are poorly rendered/barely legible (is this just a gba port??) Also, it was disappointing to find you need a second copy of the game for local multiplayer only/no download/hot-seat available. Somewhere I missed reading that in the description, there for it gets 3 stars overall. However for $20 it may not be a bad deal to get two.."
5,Buy 2!,"My husband and I each have a Nintendo DS. We bought 2 games so we could play against each other. Our favorite game is Battleship, but we have fun playing all of the games."
2,Not what I expeted!!,"I am not happy with this game collection. I thought up to four people could play, but ONLY if they have the same game. It did not say that anywhere in the description. I am very disappointed. As far as the games go, they are okay, if you enjoy the computer winning ALL the time. Amazing how that works, huh??? My kids like the games but were really disappointed when they couldn't play together. I feel like I was mislead."
3,Family Fun for Four or One!,This game takes four of the great classics and rolls them into one handy game. If you like a simple and entertaining game (or four) grab this one. Great value at just 14.99 for four Nintendo DS games!
4,Bringing back the oldies,"I gave this gave to my son for Christmas. These are all of the games that my family played as a kid... HE LOVES IT! It is fun to have them back in the family again. He likes Battleship the most, but I prefer Sorry. My 8 year old steals the game and plays Connect Four all of the time. Good Game. Four games for one low price."
4,Hot 4 the Winter,"Very good movie , this is based on 2 in your house pay per views from 1995 in the video u will see a hogpen match between the snotty at the time hhh and henry godwinn a casket match between mable and taker and 2 wwf title bouts but the bulldog loses both them , so overall it is a 4 star i would recommend it"
2,Ho Hum,Rather boring. Find it difficult to listen to the whole thing. Not worth the price I paid. Good cover art.
1,Does not Fit 2003 Saab 9-3 Vector,"Though Amazon states the A25210 fits my 2003 Saab 9-3 Vector it does NOT. Amazon went above and beyond with a refund but wanted to warn anyone before wasting their time and amazons shipping costs.Product looks fine but I rated 1 star to bring peoples attention to this fitment comment.This product fits your 2003 Saab 9-3Engine: 2.0L L4 Gas DOHC Distributorless Turbocharged Saab Trionic Electronic FI MFITrim: VectorFitment Notes: SE, VECTOR"
3,Interesting,"Thought it was well made, and impressed with the rare footage shown. A little bit dated looking, but overall good value."
3,Memoriam?,"Although the footage of 9/11 on this DVD was moving, shocking, and heartbreaking, I wouldn't go so far as to call it a documentary. Yes, it did show the footage of the attacks and the aftermath, but not once did it show the psychotic lunatics who did this to us. It did not show them smiling and bragging about how many Americans they incinerated. A little less Guiliani, and a little more firemen could have helped also. This film was made out by critics to be some sort of a historical document, however, much like our war on terrorism, it is incomplete."
4,Only a reflection not a technical review,"This DVD is only a recollection and display of video from the 9/11 attacks in New York City. More specifically, it is from the point of view of Mayor Giuliani and his staff/colleagues. The hour long HBO video is a reflection of what occurred but does not dwell on any specific aspect or point. It covers the horrors on that day with respect and eloquent including amateur/professional videos and still photos. There is no chapter selection and minimal bonus features (extra excerpts interviews). If you're looking for why or how attacks happened, then this DVD is not for you. There is no coverage other than the WTC attacks and even President Bush does not appear in the DVD. This DVD is about how Mayor Giuliani and New Yorkers reacted on this fateful day."
5,First hand look at the events of 9/11,when i first saw this documentary on hbo it was very chilling but it showed america what we will do in time of crisis nothing has hit us like this since pearl harbor but we were not able to see what happened by the people that experienced it. for me living in the bronx this dvd with what i recorded from the news is living history that when i get older i can show my grand children and great grand children so that they will never forget
4,True,"It's one of those ""true"" thing that are still hard to watch. You're not sure if you should watch... But to compile that much ""true"" info, comments, pics is to make kind of an historical document. So we never forget. Giuliani has a great way of saying it at the begining of the documentary... you'll see..."
5,Amazing message and amazing music,"I heard ""Cant keep a Good Man Down"" on the radio once and it was stuck in my head for weeks i had to go out and get the CD. And i found out that from the first song, ""Can't Keep a Good Man Down"" to the last, ""Arise My Love"" you can't help but want to listen and sing along. I can now sing along at any moment, and pick up a song half way through. Mind you, its always in the boombox. The songs on this CD just make you happy to be a Christian, more than it being one does already. If your church doesn't have a contemporary service the CD might be odd for you at first, to hear songs that relate to God in your octave. If I was told i could have on CD for the rest of my life this would be it. And that's over anything else a 16 year old might listen too."
5,Di in Maine,I bought this CD for one song: Can't Keep A Good Man Down. I heard the song on the radio several times and I liked the message for my children. I enjoy the ENTIRE CD! The messages in the music is clear and to the point. My family will replay this one over and over. Excellent!
4,Well writen and provides clear background on the case,"McLean and Elkind did a wonderful job in preparing this book. Using a chronological method, the reader is able to follow through the case from the beginning. The backgrounds of the situations, conditions and persons involved with the case are well explained. After reading this book I am now understand what is actualy the enron case all about, how did they do it and why it happened. This is really important to someone who has interest in the internal control - internal audit area."
5,One of the Best and Most Enjoyable Business Book I've read.,"Not a fan of the business book since I've found many of them so boring. I got this book based on the recommendation on BusinessWeek (I'm a fan of this magazine) and am not disappointed. It's well-written, easy to understand. The writer seems to have all the details nailed down and have a very entertain-able writing style. Almost like reading a very good novel except that this is true, which is very rare when it comes to business book. You will finish it in no time. Unputdownable."
4,A very detailed story ...,"This is a good book to read after a postgraduate course in Accounting. We all know the story, you can watch the documentary about it, but to know all the details simply worths the time, mainly because you start to learn about how the energy trading business works, how is the life of most high ranked executives and most importantly, how all this scam was executed. And for sure this is a book with several lessons, with executives with a very mediocre life (money is not everything), with a market giving the blind eye to the situation and, in my opinion, a case that shows how vulnerable is the pension system in the United States. Seems that the smartest guy in the room was Lou Pai by the way. Finally, I would not recommend this book to people with depression issues -- life can be better than this."
4,McLean And Elkind Do A Complex Tale Justice,"They're to be commended for being able to reduce accounting trickery so complex that I'm not entirely sure those involved knew what was going on, into terms that a layman can understand. I don't have a Harvard MBA, nor do I have any experience as a nacent energy trader, and while I think I understood what I was reading, I'd be hard-pressed to try to explain it. This is not the fault of either author, however. The book is highly readable and no one could have made complete and absolute sense of something designed to be so inscrutable.I appreciate too their decision to look away from some the galling greed and hubris on the part of the Eneron corporate culture (though a bit sneaks in here and there--it's hard to tell this tale without mentioning it at least in passing) and toward the chicanery that was involved in creating ""the world's greatest company."" Even at the end, I've got a hard time deciding what was real and what was an illusion."
4,Where is the Kindle version of this book?,I'm getting really pissed about kindle titles' availability. A great deal of books i search for is still not available! I'm not kidding. Digital books are great but offer is not 100%.
4,Smart Guys??,A very good book to read. You feel you have some sense of what was truely going on inside the company. It appears to be well researched and authoritative. A good buy.
3,Worthwhile read,Good book...great story. I actually know a few people in this book casually and am surprised I didn't know some of these details. It is amazing to me that this mess could actually spread to the all the conspirators that it did.I found a few of the financial chapters kind of dull...and I had a hard time following some of the info.The disgusting part to me is how hard most of us work for a few extra bucks while these crooks were making MANY Millions at our expense.
3,Not Logical,"I did not enjoy this book, because the auther started bashing Enron right from the beggining, so I did not get a real sense of a time line and when the wrong started outrsipping the good. If Enron was a failure from day one as indicated in the book, it would not have lasted this long. I understand that the creative and fradulant accounting .. but Enrfon had real assets that enabled it to have insights translated into trade, and enabled it to create a trading market.This was not emphasized in the time frame built by the auther. As a stand alone book, it is not enough.One would need to read more."
2,Hindsight is 20/20,"Monday morning quarterbacks. I would have been far more impressed if the writers had actually done due diligence as the caompany was engaging in such flagrant abuses, and blown the whistle years earlier. What I want to know is: where were all the dedicated business writers (ahem ahem) taking a truly critical look at Enron as the company was destroying it's employees pension plans and criminally ""Laying"" waste? Far too little too late. Suggestion to the authors: In the future...why not try investigating corruption before a company collapses and destroys lives? It's more challanging, noble, and let's face it, helpful! Not particularly impressed with the storytelling/writing."
4,"Blunt, intriguing analysis of Enron","This book goes through Enron's rise and fall while analyzing each main character. McLean and Elkind have researched well.This is quite entertaining and a fun read. The only downside is the large number of characters, but the authors have provided a character description list in the beginning of the book. I frequently referred to the characters' descriptions.Overall, a good book on Enron's choices over the years."
3,Mediocre but satisfying road-trip comedy,"Lea Thompson is over-the-top and fantastic in a role that finds her playing an uptight mother who is at times the underdog and other times the villain. Poor Mrs. Gainor just wants to relive a sort-of mysterious perfect vacation she had in Doheny Beach, California, during her high school years. It slowly becomes evident that nobody but her wants this out-of-the-way vacation. Everyone else would be happier settling for their perpetual crash pad: Branson, Missouri.Everyone in this ensemble piece--including ""Home Improvement"" alumna Patricia Richardson as a well-meaning aunt--is adequate. The plot is relatively predictable and the gags are commonplace, but a few funny scenes and an energetic Thompson may win this one a few fans in the audiences of understanding indie film fans."
3,Not His Best,"iight to tell u the truth im not to impressed with this cd.. althought there are SOME solid tracks.. nothing compares to his albums ''In A Major Way'' And ''Charlie Hustle''. Some Tight Songs To Me Are, Anybody Can Get It,Quarter Backin,And A Couple Others.. Honestly I Wouldnt Really Wanna Buy This..But Wuteva..Iight Peace"
4,40's still tight,"e40 is trying hard to crossover and it shows he made the best out of a bad situation he's working with a lot of newjacks who can't relate to the west coast flavor like clipse, bonecrusher, and lil jon but still a good cd. 40 does'nt need these newbies get back with the click."
4,Breakin' News...Another Solid Effort From FortyWater,"If you're wondering if E-40 has lost his touch yet,the answer is an emphatic NO.FortyWater pretty much sticks to the same formula that has made him one of the best rappers to ever come out of the Bay Area.Highlights include the bumpin ""Northern Califoolya"" and ""Quarterbackin'""."
4,H-Town Representa',"I'm a true E-40 fan, but I'm going to have to listen to this one some more. I liked a few cuts right off the top, but I don't feel that this is the normal mobb type sh_t, sound'n like a gorilla trying to get up out of the trunk E-40 music. If you're an E-40 fan buy, if not you may be missing out on something new fresh. I gave 4 stars, because I have to get use to it. Otherwise I would automatically give him 5 stars."
2,This is an a-typical Creationism book by a Creationist.,"Review by David Rice.This book has some gross problems, chief of whichis the author's failure to correct falsehoods thathe mentions concerning claims against evolutionand evolutionary theory. The author repeats thelie that ""there are no transitional fossils"" atleast four times!Another gross flaw in the book concerns the author's complaint that science does not include occultism (gods, supernatural, etc.). If many of the author's complaints were valid, astrology would be ""science."" So would shaking chicken bones and feathers during a voodoo ""healing.""There are many other uncorrected falsehoods inthe book. A complete review may be found in the[...] site in mid-August.All-in-all, this book is destined to be a big hitwith the author's co-Creationists, and a big yawnfor scientists. It is ""preaching to the Creationist choir."""
1,Evolution and Creationism are not on an equal footing.,"I am was not aware that evolution was such an issue in the United States. On the continent evolution has been widely accepted for over a hundred years, I don't see how Creationism has survived scientific argument other than by a mental block. I agree with the previous reviewer, the writer has insinuated that because a lot of people believe in Creationism in America that that logically means there must be good arguments for it."
5,Excellent Resource,I am most appreciative to have received this product in good condition as stated! It was delivered in a timely manner & has been beneficial to my Bible study group. The workbook is compatible with the book of the same name & I recommend it to any man who is struggling with sexual issues and/or addictions. I recommend this book to the women in their lives so they will have a better understanding of what their man is going thru! My hat is off the authors of this book. Thank you!
5,An enlightening book in the face of life's temptests,"A truly enlightening book in which the author leads through the trials, temptations and devastations involved with life and life changes. Finding the courage to change dirrection when all seems enescapable. Heart felt honesty guides us through these times, and the author guides us on tapping this within ourselves."
1,"Too simple, too trite, silly most of the time","I found the book to be amazingly simple minded. The conversation with God were almost a parody of themselves. At a given point God tell him to get information on a certain subject, even directs him to certain books. God actually sounds like a bad librarian. The main character's life is so predictable. You wonder how could someone so simple get so well connected with the mistical powers of the universe."
3,Informative and nothing more,"The book serves up only what the blurb promises - a detailed account of how Al-Jazeera was set-up and its turbulent growth - and nothing more. But I suspect that most people who pick this one would look for more than that, as otherwise its just a sequence of events that anyone would forget after the last page is turned. Hugh Miles is a journalist and as befits his profession, he just reports on the events and leaves out in-depth analysis that would have made this book much more enjoyable.As for the judgement on if Al-Jazeera is biased, it is obvious where the authors sympathies are. But one thing is for sure - given the nature of the news Al-Jazeera handles, it is a case of damned if they do and damned if they don't. Beyond this, what you will make out of it is entirely based on your political view.Given the nature of the middle-east politics, the channel is truly a pioneer in the media world and for that alone, the book deserves to be read."
5,A Definite Award Winning Book about the Mysterious Channel,"An insightful outlook of a dimension not previously discussed anywhere. A winner in credibility, intelligence, and objectivity. A book that should most definitely become a documentary because of its honesty and challenging language, but even more importantly one that should be translated into Arabic!"
3,Verbose and Repetitive,"This book is an overpriced, overburdened account of Al-Jazeera's history. The author simply regurgitates information we've known about for years from the international press. If you have an eye for nuance, you should save your money and rent noujaim's documentary ""Control Room"" instead. Two years ago, I read a book about Al-Jazeera. It beats me why anyone would publish another book with same information two years later. The other book by elnawawi and iskanber is less expensive, more succinct, with less rambling."
5,"GENIUS,GENIUS,GENIUS",Marvin Gaye is all that.His Talent&Influence is Timeless.His VOice&Musical Ability are Mind-Blowing.When You Here The material Here You are Amazed at the Depth&Originality Of This Great Genius.His Songs Spoke Of Daily Life&Love.Battles Inward&Outward.He has so Much Heart&Emotion in His Work.His Words LetYou Know that the Struggle is far from Over.but His Words always Gave You Hope.He is One Of The Greatest Talents THe Music World has Ever Known.The Brother Is Missed.
5,I thought I knew every Elvis song...,"Thank you, 3,000 Miles to Graceland (also proving that Kevin Costner is an INCREDIBLE bad guy) and the Essential Elvis, Vol. 6: Such a Night, for giving me my new favorite Elvis song - ""Such a Night."" I cannot get enough of this tune... and this CD, and I am NOT a fan of live recordings.This entire CD is truly fantastic and has songs that I (a child of the 70's) did not know existed, but are just fantastic - from country sounds to beach beats, this is pure Elvis, before the drugs and incoherence of later live recordings, post-military.Give it a listen - you won't be doing much forwarding through these songs - they are too good. Elvis' version of Little Sister is great, too - and Fever, I mean come ON... good stuff here, people."
5,Amazing!,"This CD is what rock 'n roll is all about. I saw The Elms in concert for the first time recently and it was a shame that there were only about 60 people there. These guys really should be selling out stadiums. This album, for me at least, ranks right up there with some of the best albums ever made like Sgt. Pepper's or Rush's 2112. Its THAT good. If you only buy one CD this yearm this should be it. Even though its 3 years old, it still holds up. Very well written and very well performed by one of the best ""unknown"" bands in rock."
2,1 1/2 stars,"There's not much to say about this one. A few bass lines and drum sequences can get you excited for a minute. Then you wonder what these songs mean...a bunch of ramblings for artistic ""style"" perhaps... TWO WORDSUninspirationaland{yawn}"
2,Disappointing,"Going against the flow of reviews here, I found this book disappointing.For a book of this scope, it is woefully short and lacking meaty details.It rather ends up giving more space to the subjects of mysticism and the like, than to actual discourse on historical writing systems.For instance, the ""section"" on runic languages is effectively two pages long, and half of those pages are taken up with diagrams; while parts of entire, multiple chapters are dedicated to illustrating calligraphic styles thru the ages. Fascinating on its, but perhaps better studied in a different volume."
3,Well-acted.,"Interesting story of a couple transported to another planet to do battle with two other aliens with the prize being that Earth will not be destroyed if they win. Well-acted, good dialogue and a great scene involving a poker game. It does take a while to get to the battle and the clothing the female character wears (wearing high-heels into battle?) is a little far-fetched, even for that time. But overall, since this is a story of redemption and second chances, a good show."
4,Intriguing plot and entertaining,"This episode was entertaining in part because the games master of Andarra is quite a character. He actually engages in a little psycho-analysis of the humans which is rather amusing.A certain mystery surrounds the games master as we never really get to see his face clearly. He is always sitting back in the shadows just far enough to prevent a clear view of himself.When the Earth man is first teleported from Earth to Andarra, his first reaction is to ask if he is dead. The games master asks in return ""Why is it your species that is always so concerned with death?"" This implies that other races of beings are not so preoccupied with their own mortality. An interesting assumption or speculation.A final speculation: Could the tableau of the games master behind his control console be what will confront us at our own respective judgements?!"
1,;God who?,"After being rude and ignoring his friends who were trying to help, he finally HAD to listen after he ended up breaking his toy. There's no proof he learned anything, and the last page that throws in the ""personal creator"" that makes all this possible is a quick little marketing scheme for evangelicals. What a waste of trees."
3,Nothing more than low-impact aerobics,"I was quite disappointed in this video. I should have just dusted my old Jane Fonda tapes off and used those instead. This is really nothing more than low-impact aerobics. The workout itself was fine and the pace fast enough for anyone looking to get their heart rate up. If you buy this thinking that it is some new revolutionary way to work out....don't be fooled because it's not. If you are looking for a well-rounded tape, find a nice low-impact tape with floor exercises and you will be much better off."
1,still waiting for the parcel to arrive,I am still waiting for the product to arrive so unable to review .
3,Tried it and liked it,"I've used Sansone's Walkaerobics program for about two years now- the Two Mile walk is not beginner's level (she has other tapes that are- and are great) but it is an easy to follow video- featuring walking and toning, and ways to gauge your progress. If you don't have alot of time to work out and like the privacy of your own home with ""real"" people on the video to follow- ( not all hardbellies!)you'll like this. And if you're at that creaky knee, aching back stage of life- you'll find the movements not too harsh on the ole joints!"
5,IT MADE ME LOOSE 48 LBS,"This video is awesome. I a work all day sitting on a chair, and I have few time to do exercise - wether it is outdoor or indoor -.Besides, many times I feel tired and do not go out for a walk. This video is fantastic !. You really enjoy doing the various exercises, and feel great. I have been doing this for 3 months and have loose 48 lbs. I will soon put my before and after pictures in a web page. This video is truly amazing !"
3,good for beginner exercisers,"It may be a bit dated, but this is a fine 30-minute walking workout for beginners or those who want a simple, somewhat mindless routine. There's a decent warm-up and cool-down, and though Leslie seems a bit 'off the cuff' with her comments, it's a good basic program - especially when the weather doesn't permit outdoor exercise."
4,Not my favorite but....,"This is not my favorite of Leslie's tapes but is still a good workout. I prefer the tapes where she is alone, she doesn't get annoying when its just her. I definitely use the mute on this one and add my own music, plus the music is not very good."
4,Good Workout...more intense than her Walk Away the Pounds,This is a good workout for those who enjoy the Walk Away the Pounds videos/dvds. It is more intense than the WATP 2 mile and at the one mile point has a speed of 5 mph. I wish Leslie would do more aerobics only videos.
4,2 MILE WALKAEROBICS WITH LESLIE,This fast paced 2 mile walkaerobics workout is fast and effective. Leslie's cuing of the steps makes this easy to follow. Leslie announces each quarter mile accomplished as it is shown on the bottom of the screen. Her encouragement and upbeat personality makes me continue to 2 miles when I get tempted to stop at one mile. As a beginning exerciser I find her friendly personality to be encouraging. This is a program I would recommend to anyone who wants to feel enthusiastic about doing the workout and energetic when their finished. I am looking forward to progressing to Leslie's 3 mile workout.
4,Great beginning workout,"This video is difficult enough to get your heart rate up but not a killer. Leslie Sansone is peppy but not pukey perky. The steps add some variety without being too dancy. If I'm on a big workout night, I do this one first then do a toning tape. If I can only do 30 minutes, this is a fun one to just lift your energy. It's a really good starter tape."
2,Not what I expected!,"After trying (and liking) her older tapes, the 2 Mile Walk was a big disapointment to me. Regardless of what the jacket says, I find the difficult patterns and dancy moves hard to follow, the people on the video are not the ones on the cover (they are all young females), and in general, had little to do with walking, I'll stick with her ""40 Plus Workout"". I wish there was a money back guarantee."
5,A great workout for any fitness level,"I am over 40 and more than 80 pounds overweight - I have been treadmill walking 2 miles 3x a week for 8 months and I found Leslie Sansone's 2 mile walk challenging but do-able. It is definitely a better workout than what I have been doing but I can finish the whole thing. Her voice is easy to listen to, the music is good, and she mixes it up enough to make it interesting but not confusing. It goes by so fast you won't believe that you did the whole two miles by the time it ends. I love this tape!"
5,GREAT EXERCISE,This video was wonderful. The directions are great and the music is wonderful. I really have enjoyed working to this adn like the walking videos. Going to buy some more videos by her. I recommend this especially if you are overweight or have not exercised in a while.
4,It's a good workout!,"I saw her latest infomercial for ""Walk Away the Pounds"" and I thought before I spent the money I would try one of her other tapes for less. I think she's great! I'm in my late 20s and in pretty good shape, with a little weight to lose. This is challenging for someone who isn't very coordinated (ie, Me), but I managed to get the hang of it. I like that she alternates between simple walks and ""trickier"" steps- keeps me from getting bored, but not from participating."
5,GETS ME GOING IN THE MORNING!,"I purchased this video the year that it was released. I graduated from her 1 mile video that I'd purchased in 1990. It's simple, effective and fun. For those looking for a good place to start without the jumping, martial arts kicks and painful floor exercises, it's definitely the way to go! Leslie gets a little annoying from time to time, but her routine gets the heart rate up to where it needs to be to get a good early morning workout."
4,"Better than most, except for the jazzy music","I loved Sansone's 15 minute-one mile walk video so much that I've decided to go for the 30 minute-two-mile walk. Although Sansone's attitude and personality are very motivating, I found that the music was a bit (just a bit) disappointing to my taste. Also, a few of the movements were not so impressive. Overall, it's a good video tape, and I'm glad that I found Sansone through amazon.com."
1,Very Different....,The actual product is a lot cheaper looking and larger than depicted in the photo. The picture is almost misleading and I was very disappointed.
5,"Litle George,","Litle George, always good things with Geroge. He goes on a lot of Adventures and kids love that, then watching a little Monkey kids love that to.He has great Storys for little and older kids also."
3,Thought this was a movie,"I should have read the description better. I thought this was a feature film but it turns out this DVD contains a series of Curious George TV episodes. The kids still love it but it's not what I thought it was, especially given the cover on the DVD."
3,I was dissapointed,"I was dissapointed with one of the episodes on this DVD which was ""George in the dark"". My 3 years old never had any problems sleeping in the dark until he saw this movie. It teaches little children to be afraid of the dark instead of teaching them to be brave and get over fears they could have.Since my son watched that movie it has been a nightmare for all of us when is bedtime. I think people should be a little more carefull when they are managing a little child's mind."
5,My son loves it!!!,My son has been watching the series since he was six months old. It is one of two that he watches. He loves the bright colors and I like the lessons. I do try to watch each episode before he does so that I can make sure it is ok but have never had a problem.
5,Winning the Future,This is a must read for all voters and those who will soon be.This guy should run for U.S. President.
4,Winning The Future: A 21st Century Contract With America,"Former Speaker Gingrinch provides a positive, albeit ambitious vision for our country using sound policies using common sense ideas. Republicans, Democrats alike can appreciate Speaker Gingrich's belief in America and how we can maintain our competitive, moral, social and technological edge in the world. A must read for anyone interested wanting to participate in the public debate."
2,Same Old Recycled Conservativism....,"There really isn't anything new here that you haven't heard conservatives complain about. It is all the Liberals fault. The only exception that is new, is the idea of Patriotic Education for our children in public schools. Liberals are labled anti-God and religion. I think these conservatives want everyone to think like them. Indoctrinate children not to be independent thinkers. To Newt and the others, Patriotism is like a religion. You follow both blindly. What I find an interesting contradiction is his simultaneous support for both science and religion. He feels we need more of both."
3,Broad But Interesting,Gingrich supplies some broad strokes and blurs the lines somewhat between conservatism and liberalism. Should be required reading for all Newt haters. Actually 3 1/2 stars and would have been 4 with some facts to support certain of his generalizations.
2,A mediocre book,As a conservative I was hoping more out of newt. This book was severly disappointing. His arguments are sometimes convoluted and other times he is a bit straying off topic. Not the finest in conservative writing by far. He is certainly no Sean Hannity or O'Riely
3,The party line,"Perhaps I had been expecting too much? Newt does deliver on his progressive economical and enviormental ideas, yet seems too just toe the party line on a lot of social issues. I just always thought that he was more of an independent thinker."
1,totally alful waste of paper,This book stunk so bad I had to wrap it in fish to get rid of the smell. Don't waste your moeny-- wait until it hits thedollar store if you MUST read it.
1,FUNNY STUFF!!!,"After reading the last chapter of the book I had to vomit. Newt is a great example of Republikan values...he ran out on his wife that had been diagnosed with cancer to marry the woman that he had been carrying on an adulterous affair with. Newt, your 15 minutes of fame are OVER! Please, crawl back under your rock..."
5,Why is this man not a choice for the upcoming election?,Newt makes so much sense in his spoken word as well as here in his book. I only wish more people would read it and get a clue.
4,A large dose of reality,Great ideas he has! I think they will very difficult for a majority to accept. Too revolutionary from our current state! Or should I say too grass rooted. We've drifted to far from the original intent of our founding fathers!
3,Why Newt Gingrich will never be President.,"The former Speaker of the House is categorically one of the premier policy thinkers of our time but there is a huge difference from being able to think and being able to govern.This opus magnum is a worthy sequel to his To Renew America, to be sure, but what tarnishes this great work is the fact that much of what the former Speaker has to say is just that: what the Speaker has to say. He has no record to point to. He has never governed.This book is a great read for those of us who are amateur ""policy wonks;"" it is good dinner party conversation material, if you hang out with friends, liberal or conservative, who like to discuss ideas.As far as Newt Gingrich being a ""major player"" in the arena of ideas, history has passed him by. He had an opportunity to be the conservative answer to Tip O'Neill in the House, but for some reason, blew this opportunity. This is why his book rings hollow."
3,Pandering,"Ol' Newt dicusses 5 main themes: Islamic terrorists and rogue dictatorships armed with WMDs; secularisation of government; American patriotism; the economic position of the US, and unfunded Social Security and Medicare.All of these are obvious, significant, 'clear and present'dangers to the US, with the exception of the secularisation of the state. Here Newt, (for a rationalist) panders to the far right religious evangelical (nuts) who have corrupted Christianity for their own self-serving purposes. The Christain faith espoused by these loonies is ultimately wrong, self corrupting and full of theological (and commonsense) inconsistencies.Enough of this mumbo jumbo, and keep the state and religion separate!!"
2,Republican tripe...but OK if a Gingrich fan,"Too much hype and right-wing politics for me, but if you're a Newt fan, then buy the book."
1,UGH!!! He's back!!!,"Newt Gingrich is a hypocrite.Gingrich's family values - he has been divorced twice and married three times.Gingrich's patriotism - he avoided the draft during the Vietnam War with a graduate school deferment.Liberal elite? The Republicans have baby bush in the White House and own a clear majority in the Senate and House. In short, they can do just about anything (within their reason) they want and pass just about any legislation.In short - this is a book strictly for the ignorant."
1,A Wonderful and Inspiring Role Model,"This guy is a fool. Neocons will grovel in delight with this garbage (just like they do with Ann Coulter's twisted views) so they can live their religious lives in self-righteousness. Newt, and he is a newt, abandoned his wife for ""worse, not better"" when she was in poor health. How can a man without morals talk about liberals who are supposed to not have morals?"
1,More politico-babble from the master,"As with all Newtie's previous ""ideas"": Everything he proposes sounds good to the simple-minded, until even they think about it, and then it all falls apart."
2,Values of Convenience,"I always find it entertaining when someone like Mr. Gingrich spreads his propaganda by championing the virtue of Faith by using God as a central figure in society. Funny, I seem to remember Newt being divorced at least once. While the book is entertaining and does present some valid points, you can get the same information from reading a paper or watching Comedy Central."
5,Wow!,I haven't been familier with the Rosetti concertos. They are well performed on this CD. This is a great gift for a French Horn player to study and reflect. Perfect music for anyone who enjoys good music while driving a Mercedes with the top down. Delightful!
1,Poorly written,"I don't like to pan books, but this is poorly written with an unbelievable romantic premise. How could two healthy adults not notice that they were attracted to each other after several years? The worst part of the book was the poor writing. The author needed to ""show"" more and ""tell"" less."
4,Gomez provides a level of confidence for online consumers,"Gomez has always provided a wealth of information online about e-commerce, and the quality of their sites. Here they provide a more indepth look at these sites for those who still like their information printed on paper.I found the book provided me with easy access to information about where to invest, bank, and buy online. As we try to wade through the overwhelming number of consumer sites online this is a must have."
4,Great Reference Guide,I found this book easy to use (especially for an Internet beginner like me). I bought it last week and am using it as a reference guide (not sure it would be much fun as a straight read) to start my holiday shopping online. It's fun to be part of my children's generation using this technology (and they can't believe how much I know now because of the help this book provides :)
4,communications,"Nice product, I use it for motorcycle riding communication I wish the volume was better but it works. You may have to use two face tape to keep the mic in place. All in all worth the money."
3,Headset is not compatible for some radios,This headset is not compatibe with 'COBRA' radios (muli-channel walky-talky) It activates the send button and you cannot recieve any transmition as long as the headset is plugged in. That makes the headset useless for a variety of radios.
3,All the better it gets,"These work great. This is the best price. This is the best quality available. In reality they are worth no more than $10 and I'm sure someone giggles every time some one buys a set. Think about it ,, these cost more than most radios! What a screw job! but this is the best screwing of all the headsets"
4,Works great but...,"They work great and we really enjoy using them but the adhesive on the microphone doesn't hold very well. Also, in the heat it gets sticky around the edges and gets on the helmet."
3,Headset review,One of the headsets I purchased didn't work out of the box. The other headset the PTT button stopped working after 1 day use
2,Bulky to use.....,The cords provided for the hook-ups are way too long....especially when you are riding a motorcycle....I could wrap them around me twice and still have cord left. It would be very easy to get caught up in these when turning a corner. We returned the item...
3,Not what I had hoped for,"After hearing the Barefoot Contessa rave about using this product in recipes, I was disappointed by the actual taste which was ho-hum. Besides...the cost of shipping this item made it even more of a disappointment."
1,there is not truffle,I was not happy with this truffle butter. It is flavored with truffle oil there is no truffle in the mix.... Too bad. Good thing I had already found real truffle butter at Whole Foods the day before this arrived so I could make Thanksgiving Dinner
5,simply put steel prophets best,"I have all of steel prophets cds,and this is different compared to the rest, its still heavy, but with a more melodic sound,and i LOVE IT! Love the change ups from melodic to heavy and they do it tastefully.Dont get me wrong all of Steel Prophets cds are good,but this one is great.A must for all metal fans of helloween,gamma ray,angel dust,freedom call."
4,Energetic show. Earl's voice not like on record.,"Don't be too hard on ETC for his mildly disappointing vocals on this otherwise energetic live set. I recall hearing something years ago about him suffering from vocal problems. Don't know if it was a medical problem, or just overuse over the years. I'm listening to this CD right now, and it's good. And, of course, it IS live, afterall. A little personal story...I work in radio. In 1984, ETC came to a big nightclub in Corpus Christi Texas where I was working at the time. Our Program Director was standing out back with Earl by his tour bus. I went out there and met him. He asked me to hand him his guitar when he came in and went on stage. I put the strap over his head when he came in. Fond memory. I'll never criticize Earl Thomas Conley. He's one of the all time greats. And I'm thrilled I finally found a live CD, after all these years. Thanks Amazon."
1,Say it ain't so--Disappointing Vocals--save your money,"I looked forward to this live set by a terrific writer and vocalist whose heydey was the 1980s. The songs age well, however, unfortunately, Mr. Conley's voice doesn't come close to the quality of when he was a regular at or near the top of the country radio charts. I gave the cd two listens, but I knew halfway through the first listen it was a waste of time and cash."
1,Poor Read,"Not to be mean, but I thought this was ridiculous even for a beginnners book. Characters doesn't develope there're no feelings whatsoever.Don't waste your money to buy this."
4,A Handy Widget,"I haven't had to use it much yet but it's a handy thing to have clipped in your pocket. You get a lot of ""bang for the buck"" with the multiplicity of tools and it seems to be very well made. While its compactness is a plus in your pocket, it also limits the amount of leverage you can apply to a really tight nut when using the adjustable wrench. Perhaps a provision for an extension on the handle might be a good idea to incorporate in the next model. I'd also liked to have seen a better storage arrangement for the bits. I worry I'll lose them and they have a tendency to bite into into your hand a bit when you're using the tool."
3,"CRKT ""Guppie""","I've had one of these since it first came out. Generally OK, mostly does what I need it to do. HOWEVER, the flashlight is completely useless. I gave up trying to fix the contact and/or feed it batteries well over a year ago. Unless the light is redesigned, don't count on using it for long. Otherwise a decent product."
2,"Good idea, but could be better","i liked the idea of a multitool integrated into a carabener. Unfortunatly they fell short. after two days of carring the bit attatchment fell off and was to never be seen again. maybe useing magnets was not the best way to secure the bit holder and flashlight. now my ""multitool"" is now just a wrench and a blade that can snap on to my backpack easly. i dont recomend buying this tool until they redesign it."
2,Great idea but it is really small,"I like the idea but keep in mind the knife is very small. It really is Li'l, Its more like a minnow than a guppy. I though it would clip on a belt loop but it is barely big enough. If you are looking for something small then you maylike it."
4,Very useful,"Use this all the time! After i first purchased it I had some trouble with the wrench part not working, but everything else is great."
4,Love it,"Everything is great, the only thing keeping it from a full 5 is the adjustable wrench. Its loose, it wobbles, it does not stay when set. Other than that, the product is great."
3,So so tool!,I bought this based on online information and not hands on. In retrospect I think I would have been happier with it's big brother as I'm having trouble finding a use for this tool. Ultimately I bought the knife centric Leatherman Skelatool which I'm loving to death.
2,Columbia Guppie,This knife was too heavy for my taste. The light was very weak. Otherwise well constructed and others could be happy with its versatility.
3,Disappointed,"When I first saw this item I was intrigued. I used to carry a very small crescent wrench and have missed having it since it was lost. The wrench on the guppy is not well machined.I don't care for the bit holder/led light. It's big for it's intended function and adds a lot of bulk to the tool. Seems to stay in place fairly well but I have been carrying it in my baggage. If the caribiner or belt clip were used I wouldn't be surprised to lose it. The screwdriver is awkward to use. There is a reason for screwdrivers to have shanks on them and the guppy doesn't . The led is a weak light, batteries were done in short order and replacement is NOT user friendly. To top it off the darn thing is heavy too.This tool might be wonderful for some folks...I see a lot of good reviews...Myself, I'm going to replace my 4"" crescent and keep my Leatherman."
2,Not that handy....,Very interesting little tool. Not very useful outside of the knife. The attachment with the screwdriver bits falls off constantly and you should def put a lanyard on that thing.
3,Almost Useful,"The Guppie is an almost useful tool, but falls short. The crescent wrench portion does not open very far (1/2"") and so is useful for smaller nuts only. It also has a lot of play in it so that it wobbles and has to be held in tension re adjusted constantly to use. The screwdriver portion is OK but can't get into tight spaces as the bits are quite short. The knife appears to be acceptable but I have not used it much to see how long it will hold an edge. The little built in LED flashlight could be useful, I don't know how long it will run on the small battery, but for emergency repair it puts out a reasonable amount of light and is magnetic, so it could be stuck to something metal while you tighten a loose bolt.In summary, it is cute, but could be better made, especially the wrench."
5,You'll actually carry this,"I have bought many, many little tools that promised to change my life and save the world when it all depended on having a small screwdriver on hand... All those tools are in a drawer somewhere while the Li'l Guppie is on my beltloop. This tool is small enough and easy enough to carry around that you actually do. Have a bottle opener, screwdrivers, wrench, and a knife handy, not on your dresser at home where you can't reach it when you need it."
3,"Handy, convienent, dont throw away your Leatherman yet.","I have only had this for a few weeks but have tried to put it to the test. The little flashlight is handy but not quite what I would consider bright, the magnet feature is really handy for holding a few loose screws. The screwdriver inserts seem to be of high quality. I have not tried the wrench yet, but the size range seems limiting (Mountain biking, great), more on that later. The knife blade seems to be fairly high quality.This is not a tool box. It is small, handy, light, convienent and has some great features. The wrench feature seems limiting, would have nice up to 5/8"". No pliers, but that is the point. Small. clip in on your belt, backpack, whatever you carry with you. At some point you will say to someone, ""Here, use this.""."
2,Don't let it get wet,"Just got the guppie about two weeks ago. At first inspection, it is a really cool product. The crescent wrench feature is really what sold me. I own several pliers based multi-tools, but the pliers do not work well on nuts. I took it kayaking with me on a trip down the Guadalupe river in New Braunfels, and the darn thing was rusty after only one day clipped on my pocket. The feature and design is unique, but the durability leaves more to be desired."
4,great little pocket tool,"fits in my pocket or on my belt loop. lots of tools in one, handy to have in an emergency or around on the farm."
3,"Not that bad, not that great.","The main character is your typical mysoginistic jerk. He looks down on anyone who isn't as well read as he is, but can't even manage to keep his own {self} out of poverty.Ought to be called ""I wanted to be a spoiled frat boy forever.""That said, it is pretty well written, considering Lasner is trying really hard to be Kerouac and does a decent job ripping him off. But about the only empathy you'll have for this guy is because his girlfriends are all bigger jerks than him.I pity Lasner's parents if this is an autobiography. I guess it might also serve as an imporant window into the mind of the self-obsessed. So that might be worth a star or two."
5,Into the mind troubled by love,"A finely written book with an even finer title! A mad trip into the neuroses of a twenty-something mind as he struggles with his troubled self and a handful of troubled women--not a combination that leads to emotional health. I didn't care whether or not the narrator was ""likable."" A great book is not a popularity contest, but makes you feel and think, and this book made me do both. There are lots of other books out there if you want to feel uplifted--this book may not leave you smiling and humming, but what it will do is make you think about why and how we love, and what it means to struggle against impulses that we know are wrong, but cannot help ourselves from. If you have ever been in love, or even in like, and know the person may be bad for you, but still you can't stop yourself, you will strongly identify with the main character."
5,"Like Henry Miller, but punk","Reading FFS reminded me of when I read Henry Miller's Tropic of Capricorn way back when, except instead of moving from New York to Paris, the protagonist wanders between New York, the deep south of Louisiana, and a fictional midwestern state. It wanders from woman to occupation to rental apartment with no purpose, other than to capture the feeling that many of us did the same thing with no purpose. In that, it's perfect in its detail and ability to nail exactly what it felt like to be in this slightly punk, slightly modernist life. It was a great read and I look forward to seeing more from Lasner."
5,awesome,"lasner is a new age poet. the way he writes is just astounding! i am recommending this book to all my friends, w/ a small warning about his fondness for 4 letter words!"
3,The Purest of Bastards,"This chance can come to us only from you, do you hear me? Do you understand me? ... And me, the purest of bastards, leaving bastards of all kinds just about everywhere."
1,Extremely Unlikable,"As part of a book club, I have read many books and am always on the look out for intelligent well written stories of fiction. This was not one. I found all the characters extremely unlikable, underdeveloped and higly offensive. The ""humor"" was sophomoric at best with the added interludes unwelcome and juvenile. I have read better thought out plot lines in the childrens literature I've read to my five year old. I will say it did give our book club quite a lively discussion, as we each took a turn reading the passages we felt most offensive. I will cafefully scrutinize any further recommendations I find on the Amazon site. The back cover states it to be "" the Moby Dick of the 21st century"". The only correlation is the literal one as the author finds possibly every colorful description of his own."
4,florida zany!!!! i love it,"Any book set in a town know as ""Whale Harbor"" which has no whales catches my eye. This one did.....There are enough zany people in this town to rival Carl Hiaasen, but don't compare this author to him. She writes well in her own special way. Read her for her own special way of creating a town, and it's people....Oh, and any town where the mayor is trying to find his ""inner dog"" rates well with me.Read this book for great, funny and crazy fun. You will enjoy all the laughs.P. S. Do not read in public....persons who laugh out loud at a book may be considered suspect."
1,Disappointed with the Plans,"I was disappointed with the CD. The plans were not that good. It could have offered more useful projects to take advantage of the Kreg Pocket Hole jig. I use my jig all the time, but did not use one plan on the CD."
2,Not Mac formatted CD.,"I had the hardest time getting the cd to work in my Apple/mac. The Cd was so badly formatted that it locked up the computer. Everything finally loaded with the exception of one file. I went to kregtool.com and put in a customer service request for them to email the one file, but they replied that its just a preview file of the projects. In short they didn't send it. Guess they want me to return the CD for a replacement before they fix it.The projects aren't very well organized. I was expecting a cut list on every one of the projects. It just seems like they could have followed the same template for eveyone of the projects."
4,Great Walk,"This is my favorite Leslie Sansone set. I had it on VHS but rebought it on DVD since it was wearing out,"
5,great product,"My family loves the dvds by Leslie Sansone and they are fun. Best of all, you can do them in the privacy of your home even if you don't have lots of space."
4,Good At Home workout!,This workout is helpful in winters when I can't get out onto the streets. This short workout really increases the heart rate. My wife really loves this!
4,the walker,This is a good walk dvd..if you don't mind the early 90's look her newer dvd's are much better. I really like working out with Leslie Sansone...even though she does talk a lot.
5,Terrific value but long shipping time,"Wow! I finally figured this out! This set is made up of Leslie's 1 mile Miracle Mile, Two Mile Walk, and Walk Off the Weight System-Weight Loss Walk (3 sessions: 1, 1.5 and 1.5 segments, do all for 4 miles)...I have Miracle Mile and Two Mile Walk, and had already ordered WLW as well. The first two are good, but I prefer the new Walk Off the Weight Series with the weighted balls, because routines are very simple. Two Mile Walk is pretty vigorous and takes a few viewings to catch/coordinate everything for us aerobics Klutzs. If you're like most of Leslie's devotees though, you like and collect many of her tapes for variety. Excellent value, and you can get it more quickly than the 4-5 weeks through MarketPlace sellers."
4,Leslie Sansone two and three mile walk,"I first walked the two and then three mile walk with Leslie at my Wellness Center and loved it. She is extremely easy to follow and you really get a great workout. I had been on the treadmill and cross trainer and when I tried the walk with Leslie I found muscles that were not getting worked out! You will work up a sweat and you will feel great afterwards. I loved it so much I just ordered the Walk the Walk 3 DVD set so that I could do it at home when I can't make it by the Wellness Center. I'm like most of the others, it doesn't bother me that the tapes are dated. It is the work out that counts!"
3,good but it could be better,"I used to watch the walk show on demand tv and it was pretty good, but this dvd kind of disappointed me because it looks like old. No one in 2007 wants to exercise with a dvd from the 90's so I really hated that part.Other than that it's pretty good. The exercise is low impact, but it works, if you make the 3 miles you will notice some pain in your muscles at the next day. The third mile is definitely KILLER, oh gosh! was hard to finish that one."
4,"Good, Quick workout","This workout works the entire body. It's especially good because it doesn't take long for the workout, but you've burned a good amount of calories."
2,4 Mile Weight Loss,"I am a really big fan of Leslie's but I am disappointed with this workout. I already have the 1&2 mile workouts which are good if you have limited time to spare to exercise but it seemed good value as a package. I did not like the 4 mile weight loss walk at all some of the moves are a but complicated, the music is boring the set is boring and oldfashioned not that bothers me as long as I get a good workout. Leslie talks constantly she misses steps and looks to me like she is acting. I am sorry I really do rate Leslie but if I were you I would definitely leave this one alone."
5,Great Workout for Home,I enjoy the workout it is great for home use when you cannot get out of the house or when it is too cold.
4,This is gonna be good!,"I've only seen the 1 mile tape in this collection and I can already tell I'm gonna like it. The three tapes are of varying intensities and lengths, providing a progressive workout as you increase in fitness. Or you can rotate the tapes to provide variety and interest, or use a shorter tape on days when you have less time to exercise. I think I might even be able to use tape one (15 minute mile with optional 5 minutes of toning) in the mornings before I ""officially"" start my day.I was afraid these tapes would be too tame. I was a former advanced stepper but after a long time away from exercise, I don't have the stamina or leg strength to do even easy stepping - after my last attempt at stepping my knees hurt for a week - but these all floor, low impact moves are within my ability and still provide challenge and progression. Nondescript but upbeat music, no distracting set or funky moves. I can't wait to get on to tapes 2 and 3 in this set."
5,wonderfu workout!,"I started doing Leslie Sansone's DVD's back in December and I am hooked. I now own 4 of her DVD's and would love to purchase more. To be blunt, I am obese and looking for a way to get back to my 130lb frame. I started Leslie's workouts and in a month I have lost 4 inches on my waist, 2 inches from my hips, thighs and arms and 10lbs. I am THRILLED to say the least. Leslie makes working out fun, but it is a good hard workout with results too. I would recommend this to everyone who is looking to shed the weight!"
5,"Great, Even for Beginners","I am just beginning to to exercise after many years of being sedentary. These programs are challenging, yet fun, and they can be expanded as I get better, so I will save money in the long run. Leslie Sansone is an upbeat, and positive intructor. These programs are definate keepers!"
5,sweet sounding,"Nice deep tone out of it. Welded onto a 2006 Tacoma V6 access cab, and has a sweet deep sound to 3k RPMs, and after that it realy gets mean in the upper RPMs! No drone on the highway either! Great Buy!"
5,Wunderbar!!,"I hate when people make comparision to every Synthpop that is around with Depeche Mode.DM is the most popular synthpop band ever and of course, it will the influence for everybody that likes rock and roll and uses a keyboard to play music.But DM was not the first synthpop band. ""Die Mensch Maschine"" by Kraftwerk was released two years before than ""Speak and Spell"" and there are some comun things in both works.I remember watching an interview with the band in the ""Unplugged"" dvd and they say that they were tired with the DM comparisions, although they don't care about that nowadays. So lets give a break to this guys.This is a wonderful compilation with one new single of a band that has developed a lot. I believe there is another new track on the second cd ""Breathless"".Get ""Zenn"" as well if you want to get the full pack of singles and popular tunes."
5,Great Tribute to the Boykin Spaniel,This is a great book to share with your children and adult friends who are boykin enthusiasts. It tells of the history of the boykin spaniel in South carolina. My family has always loved boykin spaniels and had them around their houses but none of us knew the exact story of how they came to be. The Story of Dumpy and Singo is definitely worth purchasing and reading. It also makes a great gift for family and friends. It is lighthearted and well written and gives a true depiction of why we Boykin lovers adore these dogs so much.
3,Usefull,"I was looking for a way to not carry a loaded syringe lose in my pocket while I found a private place to take my injection. These are good, but I am not sure they are the best. I am still looking for something, maybe more compact that looks a little more like a pen."
1,not good,cheap price but not good. It doesn't hold the syringe securely. The MediCool ones which are priced high work much better. You get what you pay for.
1,"Malo, malo, malo!","Pura basura de no se que seudo-científica que más de uno se traga por tener el título de metafísica y repetir hasta la náusea la lírica de ""Desiderata"""" : ""tú eres un ser único entre las estrellas""... No escribo más porque ni lo amerita. NO BOTE LA PLATA!"
1,pride and prejudice,"it was worthless. I read the cliffs notes 5 minutes before my report, and did fine"
5,Healthy and tasty!,"I'm an avid tea drinker, so I was delighted to discover the Long Life brand. Their original was discontinued for some terrible marketing reason, but luckily the camomille is a great alternative. I wish they'd bring back the original, though. I'd buy both!"
4,Absolutely Amazing,"This book is awesome for any reader who is interested in seeking hidden knowledge of how science,particles, and mystery come together. If you like any of the Nicola Tesla books then you will love this one."
5,hard rockin,"I didn't really know what to expect but it was very good. I ordered this under the mistaken impression I was getting ""Big Ocean"", but it worked although very different"
1,Piece of crap,"I put blank pages through this machine when it first arrived and it crumpled the edges of nearly every sheet no matter how careful I was not to touch the edge of the machine with it. Out of 20 sheets, only one didn't get crumpled edges and it doesn't fold exactly tri-fold or exactly in half. It leaves an edge hanging out. More economical to hand fold. If I had wasted printed brochures in this thing, it would have been an expensive mistake. Don't buy it! You'll just have to send it back."
4,Cake Decorating,My daughter says she likes the book and it arrived in good condition. Lots of cute ideas in the book.
3,it's just okey,this wilton cake yearbook doesn't have many ideas for creating. you can find some ideas for different events but it's more a wilton product's shopping book.
3,Not what I thought,"I purchased a few of the older (2011 and 2012 and a 2009) yearbooks and like another reviewer, found that most of the designs are for fondant. I'm new to cake decorating and haven't had Wilton course 4 yet. I'd like to make some easier cakes just using the basics. I also noticed that the back portion of the books have the same information on tips and etc. I would like to think that Wilton could do a better job. I don't think I'll purchase the 2013 yearbook. Guess I'll have to look it over at Walmart before I spend the dollars."
5,precious moments bible,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter. I remember having a precious moments bible when I was little. She loved it! It is also much harder to find now, so I am glad I could get it on here. It was out of stock or not being sold anymore other places I looked. Very satisfied with the product! It is the NIV version which is easier to read for many people. I just wish that it came in other versions also. Over all it is a great bible to keep for a life time."
4,Teena Marie/Irons In The Fire!,"Loved the album and Teena's vocals. Brought back memories of the ""good ol days."" The music and the harmonies were just as sweet as I remembered them - makes you want to keep those irons in the fire and make love like springtime."
5,Irons In The Fire,"As a life long fan of Teena's music, this album ranks a strong 4th on my personal favorite list. I love this artist because she is truly an original who took her varied musical loves and melded them into her own style - still a courageous feat in the music biz. This fact alone is why her fan base is so loyal & fanatical, because she stays true to HERSELF and doesn't cater to the newest latest trends.My personal faves on this disc are: Irons in the Fire, Tune In Tomorrow (this was one of the first jazz influenced songs that I truly dug), I Need Your Lovin', You Make Love Like Springtime & Young Love.What's funny about Teena's music is that although heavy on the horns & synths, her music never sounds dated or classified to one era, it's truly timeless - I'm still listening to this album that was released almost 20 yrs ago like it was just released last week!!"
5,Great product,"I have ordered from this company in the past, and have always received great customer service. I would order from this company again."
4,The portable sales coach,"In clear, succinct, readable fashion, author Frank McNair summarizes time-honored sales counsel. His book is well-organized and straightforward. After each chapter, he provides a brief self-test that will help you remember his most important points. This book does not waste your time with hokey yarns; instead, it is refreshingly businesslike and easily portable. We recommend this handbook to neophytes who are starting their sales-advice libraries and to experienced salespeople who want a refresher course."
5,How You Make The Sale,"""How You Make the Sale"" is an extension of Frank McNair. The book is written in practical terms and outlines basic tenants of sales success. Frank didn't just write it; he has lived it."
1,False advertising,"This company is falsely advertising these Irwin Marples by showing the pictures, which clearly show that the chisels say Made in Sheffield, England. I recently purchased these chisels because I knew Sheffield, England makes great steel, but was very disappointed to find that the actual chisels they are sell are MADE IN CHINA. Chinese steel is renowned for being horrible low-carbon, weak steel and therefore I am returning these chisels immediately. I am extremely disappointed in this distributing company for their false advertisement and I recommend that no one purchases from this company again."
2,"Poor fit and finish, ok for crude work","I bought these thinking I'd use them as an upgrade to my old stanley 3 chisel set. I would say these are not an upgrade. These chisels are probably fine, probably good chisels. But... the fit and finish of the handles and the handles to the blades is terrible. There is a significant gap where the plastic handle is molded around the shank. The flash on the handle is some of the worse I've seen. I had to come around with a knife and clean up the ridge of flash and stump of the sprue. The factory edge is nothing to be impressed about. The edges were rolled on two of the four. I realize these are cheap chisels, and probably fine but they do not convey a feeling of quality. I am comparing these to my Stanley and Crown sets, the Stanleys were cheaper, the Crowns more expensive."
5,Great set for a beginner,"I'm a new woodworker and I needed a set of chisels to get things rolling. After reading some reviews, I decided on this set. At the price, they're a great deal and they've been very useful around the shop. I've also been practicing dovetails with them without any problem. I just need to learn how to sharpen them! Some have complained that they weren't very sharp out of the box. That might be true but I haven't noticed."
4,a solid tool at an attractive price.,"More for the handy everyman than the fine furniture maker, these chisels nonetheless merit recommendation because of their utility and very reasonable pricing. The blades cut through red oak for a door jamb installation with no noticeable wear. The range of sizes only adds to the overall valueEven if you have a top flight set of chisels, the Irwins would be worthwhile for use in more mundane jobs."
2,Am I the only one?,"I just finished reading all the great reviews for these chisels. I must have gotten some lemons. I bought them for rough work, but I expected a decent edge out of the box. Unfortunately, the edges on mine were nicked and rolled requiring resharpening before they could be used. One was damaged so badly that it had to be reground."
5,The only chisels you'll ever need.,"I've used these chisels in my woodworking business for 20 years. They're the only chisels I've ever needed. If you keep them polished up, they'll look and work like new for a lifetime. Twenty bucks is the best deal you'll ever find."
5,Takes a lickin' and keeps on clickin',"I purchased the five chisel set about 1 1/2 years ago. I use them every weekend to cut mortices, trim tenons, scrape glue, etc. They take a fine edge (hold it well) and are easily stropped to razor sharpness. I liked them so well I supplemented my set with two of their larger chisels. I love the 2"". As with most factory chisels at any price these days, you will need to sharpen them before use."
1,False advertisement,"The chisels that you receive after purchasing may be fine for your application. However, if you are like myself and are/were looking for genuine Marples chisels made in England, you might find yourself looking at these chisels and the pictures included with this item and say, ""Hey, these were made in Sheffield, England! It says so right on the blade."" Then when you receive your MADE IN CHINA chisels, you can ask for a refund and only be partially refunded because the seller doesn't understand what return shipping costs are.Overall, waste of time, waste of money, false advertisement. Buy elsewhere."
1,The smallest hooks I have ever seen!!! SMH,"This hook is so not worth getting if you plan on using it to hang a punching bag. The swivel is awesome, but because the 2 hooks are so, you can't get it over anything. I totally want a refund."
1,Manhattan made easy,"The lower Manhattan map by Mapeasy has everything you need to know about the city. Where to eat, what to see, hints, routes etc. in a plastic easy-to-carry form.Buy also the Midtown and Upper editions."
3,Did the job - mostly,"I purchased this harness for my 2000 Cadillac Eldorado ESC. Very simple to wire up and the speaker is very loud! I had to put a piece of tape over mine to quiet it down a bit. My complaint is that the clock wire won't stay hot in my application. Not sure if the connector is tapping the RAP circuit or what. I ended up having to run a seperate wire to the battery just for clock memory and ignoring the one in this connector. The speaker does chime with keys in ignition, etc... but I lost a few other audible alerts such as when an error is presented in the onboard display.Summary: This didn't solve all my problems but did allow me to get an after-market stereo installed in my Cadillac."
1,do not buy,"This is garage, if you use this harness to install aftermarket hu you will have problems with the car security. Consider tapping original harness with aftermarket hu and relocate the stock hu in the trunk, you will retain the vehicle's RAP and chime."
3,NOT JUNIOR SIZE,If you are looking for the L.Tremain Butter Bell Junior which holds 3 tablespoonfuls of butter (almost half a butter stick)...then these are not that. Each one only holds one tablespoonful...which is one pat of butter.
3,Too small,"I live alone so I was looking for a butter bell that would hold a reasonable amount of butter for one person. These are obviously intended for individual use at a dinner party or single sitting. They honestly only held about a tablespoon of butter. I held onto them in case I throw a dinner party that would require individual servings, but I had to go to L'Tremain's website to find a middle sized bell that holds about a half stick of butter."
5,Love Dinosaurs?,Really had to complete the series for myself! ha! This is a Great children and adult movie. The Time of Great Giving as part of The Land Before Time...you must have!
4,Strong addition to anyone's collection,"Congrats to Swing Out Sister for putting out a wonderful mix of music to listen to!If you're a big SOS fan you won't be disappointed. If you're a lover of cool jazz, soul & Burt Bacharach this is the CD you've been looking for!""Vivo"" represents some experimentation for SOS (through various artists) as well. This is displayed on ""Kiss My Petals Open"" & ""Danse Macabre"". There are two hip-hop cuts ""I Keep My Word"" & ""How Strange"". ""Expect A Miracle"" is the truest SOS cut on the CD.Don't wait one click is all it takes!"
1,What happened?,"I keep waiting for it to get interesting, it never did. I would not give this to anyone. I don't hate anyone that much. A novel for the dumpster."
2,a waste of money!,I love James Patterson's books but this was such a disappointment. There were huge holes in the narrative and I kept checking to make sure I hadn't skipped pages.
1,"Oh, Please!","I am generally a fan of Patterson . . . his books are quick reads . . . easy to read ""just one more chapter"" before turning out the light. With ""The Lake House"" I found myself reading ""just one more chapter"" thinking it HAS to get better. It didn't so I stopped. I didn't even bother to read the last chapter, I just don't care about any of the characters or the ""unexpected"" ending. And this from someone who was on an airplane with nothing else to read except for People magazine (which was far superior to this book).Is Patterson trying to meet a contractual agreement for book publishing here? How disappointing (ah, but how grateful I am that I checked this one out of the Library instead of purchasing it . . . . ;-)"
2,Patterson is SO much better!!,"Gosh, there I go with the exclamation points and bold letters. I usually love a Patterson novel, but this book is so beneath his talents. I feel that I am reading a book meant for third graders. The prose is so simplistic that it makes the unlikelihood of the plot so much more apparent. I love a plot that is ""fantastic"" in nature if the writing pulls me into it. This prose does not. I rarely stop reading a book until the end - I just may in this case."
3,Sequel like the original only fair,"I read When the Wind blows and found it to be okay. Although I didn't care much for the book there was some interest in what happened to Frannie and Kit and the kids. So out of curiosity, I gave the bird kids another try. It was a fast read and not completely boring."
1,"Needs a ""zero star"" rating","I guaranteed that if this were the first James Patterson book I had ever read, I never would have read another. It feels like it was written by a middle school kid at best - shallow characters, choppy plotline with huge gaping holes, stunted linguistic style. I couldn't really like or dislike any of the characters, because there was simply nothing to them. I cannot believe Patterson would put his name on this, or that a publisher would publish it."
4,cute,"This book, as well as its predecesor, are meant to be light reading for young adults in my opinion. I believe it's an easy read, not meant to be examined in great detail. Sci-fi for youngsters."
2,"One star because he wrote it, one because I read it","Amid some wonderful descriptions of scenic landscapes is a story that doesn't quite lift itself to the same height. It could have been, I thought, but when a major storyline ended suddenly and in a way that made me groan, the reality of the situation hit home. The ending thudded like the author remembered he had to be somewhere and so he decided to slap something together. The story--which was totally different from what I expected from Patterson--had so much going for it, with its brilliant, science fiction premise. And for that, you still might enjoy it."
1,"a joke, maybe...","I do like Patterson's work. Too much ""serial killer+profiler oriented"", but it works well. And ""First to die"" was a real refreshing plot. But ""The Lake House"" seems to be a joke: out of the picture family romance, ridiculous plot... Barbara Cartland trying to combine thriller and passion story: this would give ""the lake house"". The positive points of this book: good to make you sleep early and ensures you to win a yawn contest..."
5,Great Story,Love this story. Going to use it along with When the Wind Blows to introduce Max and her siblings to my 8th graders who have already read Maxium Ride. I believe it's important for the students who really love Max to know how she became the girl she is today.
1,The Lake House,More science fiction junk. Patterson should stay away from it. He's a master story teller but should not play fast and loose with science. He claims to have interviewed experts who claim such fantasies are possible with current knowledge. Nosnense! He should counult reliable experts.
1,Terrible book! Bad writing style and use of words.,"This is the first James Patterson book I ever read. I haven't been reading in a long time, and I don't remember when or where I bought this book. It was just sitting on by bookshelf. I wanted something to read for a camping trip so I grabbed this book. The writing is amateur. Everything about it is stupid. The story is stupid. The word choices was stupid. I kept putting it down because it was just too boring. Anyway, just brought it with me to read at the beach and it was unbearable how stupid and boring this book is. I'm at page 236 and decided not to waste any more time on it. I threw it in the garbage because no one should waste their time reading this book. Will never read another James Patterson book."
1,Poor fiction,"I just finished listening to the unabridged version of this book on audio. And I must say that this was a very poor specimen of fictional work. In fact, if it had not been written by James Patterson, I doubt it would ever have been published. And no, I had no idea this book was a sequel, there was no mention whatsoever on the jacket. Frankly, after listening to The Lake House, I doubt I'll bother with the first one.There were huge gaps in the story, and many, so many, unanswered questions - ah well, I suppose Mr. Patterson figured that us, the readers, would fill the gaps with our imagination. The writing was generally very childish. Huge disappointment."
1,A review of the reviews,"Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone that took the time to review this book. I took the time to read several of the reviews and quickly decided to not waste my money on this book. I'm not a sci fi person. The Lake House title has nothing to do with children that can fly. All I can say is YUCK! And from what I have read this author doesn't know how to write a good book. I'll keep that in mind as I'm always looking for a good book to read.Aria in Indiana who prefers to read books by Colleen McCullough."
1,Not up to snuff!,"This was the worst James Patterson book I've ever read. It's like he had an idea for a short story and instead turned it into a 311 page snoozer. The plot was thin and totally unbelievable and the characters, good and bad, were unlikeable. James Patterson should stick with the Lindsay Boxer series and forget about the flying brats."
1,do not waste your money,"bottom list, and he used to be good! got tape version, never got beyond 2nd tape, it was that bad."
1,AWFUL,Love the Alex Cross books - this book was a huge disappointment. I kept asking myself why I was still turning the pages instead of tossing it in the garbage. Wish I had read the Amazon reviews before reading it.
1,It Should be Said -,"You need to read this book after reading When the Wond Blows since it is the sequel. It is impossible to appreciate this book without understanding their history, I do not know why it is not marketed this way. It is a great story, if you know what is going on."
4,Great but not Patterson's usual style,It was defintely different from his usual books. But I liked it alot. The only reason I did not put 5 stars is because of the end. I was a little disappointed.
3,Nice build up,I really lie the fact that it really seemed to be building up to an all out battle. I liked the characters expecially ozmyndias and Dr. Krane. Btu the ending was nice disapointing !!but i think there is going to be a third one !
1,Don't waste your time or money! Shame on Little Brown!,"Shame on the publisher! Shame on the editor! Shame on Patterson! This book was just terrible. It's subtitle should read The King of Cliches. A first-time novelist/amateur would have done better. The writing was pre-adolescent, the plot ridiculous, and the ending downright pitiful. Patterson's attempt to ride the coattails of the original novel failed miserably. Was this a rough draft penned in less than a week? What were the editor and publisher thinking? Did they even read it before sending it to print? I doubt it."
2,One of Patterson's weakest novels...,"I have read every James Patterson novel, from 'The Berryman Murders' on and I can honestly say this is his weakest novel to date. Patterson is off and on with me. I LOVED the Womens Murder Club series and ""The Beach House"". The last 2 Alex Cross novels (Violets are Blue & Four Blind Mice) were terrible, and even though many people hated it I really liked ""The Jester"", which is probably Patterson's most purely entertaining novel. ... This novel's prequel, ""When the Wind Blows"", was one of Patterson's best non-Cross thrillers and he completely ruined it by rehashing this garbage. It's so obvious that Patterson isn't even trying anymore to do something remotely different, while writers like Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane & Ridley Pearson are writing inventive and truly good novels. Skip this thrash and read some early Patterson if you really feel the need. This man hasn't written a decent novel since ""2nd Chance""!"
2,The Lake House,I can no longer see JAMES PATTERSON on a book and assume it will be as good as his work in the past. What a disappointment. I've been trying to finish it but can't get through it. I'll do some research next time instead of buying for author. I just couldn't get past children flying. I thought I was reading Peter Pan!
1,Don't buy this book! I'd give it NO STARS if I could.,"Are we sure that this book was written by James Patterson? It is one of the worst books I've ever read, and I read LOTS of books. The short, choppy sentences have no depth. Italics don't make it, James. You need to write the emotions into the story, not paste them on with exclamation points and italics. How did this book get by the editors? What were they thinking?"
1,Preposterous Premise,"This book was a total disappointment. It lacked any quality of believability, and was based on a concept that was totally obsurd. I stayed with it through the bitter end, hoping that it would contain a twist that would bring things back to some level of logic (like maybe it was all someone's dream), but it did not. I speed read the last half of the book just to be done with it. James Patterson must have been in a dream world to think that the concept would be of interest to his readers. I'm embarassed that I spent my money on this piece of garbage."
2,LAKE HOUSE,SHOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN THIS. IT FEELS CONTRIVED. I'VE READ MOST OF HIS BOOKS AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEW ONES.THE KIDS' DIALOG IS REALLY CORNY!
3,The Lake House?,"In this interesting continuation of ""When the Wind Blows"" the winged children and their ""parents"" Kit and Frannie run from the bad guys, again... That is the part I don't understand. Why would they even think to put the kids in such a bad situation? Or for that matter, how dumb could an FBI agent be to visit a suspicious place and give his real name knowing that there are bad guys mixed in with the good at the Agency? What a set up! .....and by the way, how come they never visit the ""Lake House""????This book was interesting and fast paced but also very predictable and very dissapointing in some places where even I would not have been stupid enough to do some of the things that our FBI Agent Kit did."
1,A suprising disappointment,"Adter reading the enticing jacket flap, and knowing Patterson's previous works, I was anxious to read The Lake House. This is not a Patterson novel that draws you in immediately. The narrative is choppy and confusing and the plotline weak. I kept going back to see if I missed paragaghs or pages as events ended abruptly or were not resolved logically, and characters were left dangling. This one I couldn't put down, only because I couldn't wait to read about the next absurd idea (clones,robots,mad scientists,evil hospitals)incoporated into the story. Patterson probably wrote this one over a weekend."
1,I Can't Believe I Paid for This!,"This was the most disappointing book I've ever read! After all the promotion and hype, I was expecting much more. Not only are the characters poorly developed, but the story line...well, is there one?"
2,Very poor unbelievable story,"It's hard to believe, after Patterson writes a knockout book ""The Jester"", he comes up with this unbelievable story about children who could fly. This concept should make good reading but the whole plot of the story is marred with gore and completely unbelievable characters.I don't want to give the story away, but the ending is so foolish that it's hard to understand how this world class author could write something like this."
2,A little disappointed.,"As an avid reader of James Patterson, I was a little disappointed with The Lake House. It started out fine but ended leaving the reader with questions. For example, why did he go into so much depth about the woman working the scoop? She never came into play again, so did we really need her? And the other clones? Did they die also? And how did Kit escape? Also it tended to be a little hokey at times with all ""The Flock! The Family"" together again stuff. Please don't get me wrong I will still wait for his next book to come out because he's still a very entertaining author, but I need to feel a book has been completed, and that the author really enjoyed writing his own story. Just don't rush it next time."
1,Patterson should be embarrassed,"I bought this book for a vacation read, where I just want an enjoyable, fun read. This book was so poorly written that it interfered with the dumb, unbelievable story. Maybe this book was the result of another experiment: Can great marketing sell a lousy book? The answer is apparently yes, to the disappointment of readers and buyers. Don't waste your time!"
1,Patterson's worst,"OMG -- the writing is just horrible! I can't believe I read the whole thing -- just hoping it'd get better, I guess. The conversations, the thoughts, the gratuitous foul language -- does ANYBODY talk or think in words like these? Come on, James Patterson, admit that you didn't really write this..."
1,Don't waste your time - or money,"This material is so poorly and sophmorically written, a second grade student could have done better. I've enjoyed reading several previous Patterson novels. But I can't believe this book actually got published. If I were he, I'd be embarassed to submit such material to a publisher. But also, shame on them for putting it to print! I will not buy his books again."
2,Not a powerful punch,"After much anticipation, I felt let down by the sequel to When the Wind Blows. The plot is basically identical to the first story, and I found my interest waning the further it progressed."
2,Author gives up at the end,"The first 2/3 of the book does a good job of holding your interest. Chapters alternate between first person, as the main character recounts her experiences, and third person, allowing the reader to view the evil goings-on elsewhere. But just as the book builds to a climax, the author gives up. The situations are resolved without saying how or in really amateurish fashion. Multiple subplots are never finished. In one case, the judge references a situation which a few pages earlier we are told was kept secret from everyone.The book gives the impression that the author ran out of time as the publication date neared, so he had an eighth grader throw together a few quick pages to wrap things up.An aspiring author might want to read the first 2/3, set the book aside, and then write an ending for themselves. They'll probably do better than James Patterson did."
1,"Sheer, unadulterated crap","This book, and I use the term loosely, is pure garbage.I wasted enough time reading it, so I will waste no more time reviewing it."
3,"Not His Best, But Lots of Fun","If you liked Max and the kids and you like Frannie and the FBI guy, you'll like this one too. Great fun. Not Hemingway or Fitzgerald, but a fun late night read. I'm a simple man. Give me a good somewhat plausible story that keeps me turning the pages and I'll buy your next one."
1,Worst book ever,"I""m easy on fiction books. I don't care if plots are similar, or charactors underdeveloped or whatever. I am not a professional to critisize that kind of stuff. As long as it's fun to read, has some action, and not too unreal, I""m ok. But this book, which I actually finished, was the worse I have ever read. I liked when the wind blows and when I saw this on sale, I quickly grabbed it. (No wonder it was on sale!) The plot and writing was just so lame. (What was the plot anyway?) There was absolutely nothing interesting or exciting and the main idea was just so stupid. I am not a real Patterson fan but from what I read (When the wind blows, Jack & Jill, Along came a spider, Cat & Mouse) they were all good reads. This was urrr......... Not recommended."
3,Not such a bad book,"My opinion of this book may be slightly colored to the fact that I have just recently begun reading Patterson. I like his style and the stories he tells, and I must admit that I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Although its predecessor, When the Wind Blows, is a much better book, The Lake House was still a good book. However, the last 50 pages or so are a bit of a let down after such an awesome beginning. Thus the three stars. If you like sci-fi thrillers, this book and When the Wind Blows are for you."
1,awfully slow paced verbose book,"This is the first book by James Patterson that I have read and this is no where close being concise and fast paced. It is too verbose (excessive fillers), packed with too many exclamations, too many adjectives and too much idolization of each character (Kit, Frannie, Max and Oz) by the other that gets boring. There is not much suspense, drama or story built up. It was a real pain to read it. I have actually registered with amazon right now just to post the review.The copy I picked up had lots of great stuff to say on the cover like ""un put-downable"", ""Don't read it alone"" etc etc and the story was a total let down and in complete contrast to all the great stuff on the cover that did the selling.According to me this is not drama / suspense / horror / thriller (medical or non-medical). I'd anyday read another of Robin Cook books."
2,Predictable,"This book is so predictable that there was no major plot development that I didn't guess at first. The way the heros win their battles is ridiculous, they just do it.Stupid, boring, and short (the pages are mostly blank)."
3,Entertaining!!,"For Patterson this is light reading, but entertaining!!! I do not think Patterson wants these characters to deep too deep!!! An adult-adolescent book. Good, breezy reading after a complicated day!!!"
2,It could have been better,I finished reading this book in 4 days. I'm glad that I waited to get it from the library. When The Wind Blows was much more entertaining and adventurous. The ending was silly.. didn't like it. I look forward to reading new Alex Cross series.
2,"an easy read, yes...thrilling, no!","I listened to the audio cassette of this book, but even an 8 hour drive couldn't convince me to finish the final cassette. The story was interesting, but written at a fourth grade reading level. Lots of repetion and exclamations. Fly, fly, fly! Up, up, up! His style of writing gets irritating and boring. The unique story could have been better."
1,unbelieveable,I liked his previous books. THIS ONE IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. THE INSIDE COVER DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A SCIENCE FICTION BOOK ABOUT HUMANS WHO ARE HALF BIRDS. Very misleading. It does not even deserve a 1 star
1,Stupid Book,I read this book all the way through and I kept hoping it would get better. I love James Patterson's writing but this book was just plain stupid and I would never recommend it to anyone. Shame on me for wasting my time and shame on James Patterson for wasting his.
2,Boring sequel,"Although this book is a very fast read, there is nothing new in this sequel to When the Wind Blows. Once again the kids are being stalked, and Frannie and Kit are trying to save them from the evil Dr. Kane. The ending is just plain silly. If you must read this, save your money and get this from the library or wait for the paperback. Bring back the Alex Cross books as these are Patterson at his best."
1,I want a refund,"I can't believe I wasted money on this tripe. I was recovering from surgery and desperate for reading material, so I picked this book from the best seller list. What a disaster...horrible writing, non-existent plotting, inane dialogue, unreal characters. I laughed all the way through it though the author didn't intend it to be funny. The characters seemed to magically get out of situations with no explanation...for example, Max, the bird girl, is shot, and two scenes later she turns up fine, completely healed from her wounds after somehow (again not explained) crawling into an air duct in front of the bad guys' eyes. What!?!?! I kept checking the level of my pain pills, thinking I'd somehow overdosed. I only kept on reading because I was fascinated by its badness...like a train wreck I couldn't keep my eyes off it.I've never read this author and never will again. If I had to chose between re-reading it and more abdominal surgery, I'd have to think about it."
1,possibly the worst book I've ever read...,"Words can't begin to express the hatred I have for this book. From the large print, double spaced 2 page chapters that stretch this to 376 pages to the 970 gazillion exclamation marks (!!) to the stupid one word sentences. (oh. my. god. this. book. sucks.) I have liked Patterson before but will definitely read a review of his next book before I pick it up (obviously I didn't do that this time). If there were a way to give a book a negative star rating, I would have."
1,James Patterson at His Worst,"The story continues the tale of the bird children - beautiful children with super powers and the ability to fly. They escape the School. They are reunited with Frannie and Kit. They are chased by the Bad Guys. They uncover a lab deep in the bowels of Liberty Hospital where sci fi things are going on. They get captured. They escape. All is well. End of story. Who cares?I love to read James Patterson and have read every one of his books. That said, I have to say that this is the worst book he's ever written. It was boring, juvenile (it could be a teen book), simple, poor, transparent plot - I came very close to not finishing it - something I rarely do.I kept thinking that James Patterson had his teenager try his hand at writing.... Or, that he was tired and hired someone else to write the book..... What I don't want to think is that this is the best we can expect from him in the future."
1,Bird-Brained,"James Patterson lays an egg (couldn't resist). When we will learn.This book is a pointless ""thriller"" loaded with tin-ear dialogue and enough stale pop-culture references to make you think he's taking product placement fees. Patterson's breathless prose runs toward 6th grade level and use of exclamation points! AND Italics! It gets old! Fast! By the end of the third chapter - which in a Patterson book is page 5 - I knew this book was a loser. I slogged through it though, because I had 2 hours to kill.For anyone who still might be interested, here's a plot summary: six kids are genetically engineered to have wings. And be geniuses. And listen to Macy Gray! (Damn those exclamation points!) The kids are being chased by bad men. With guns! They are helped by a selfless vet and a renegade FBI agent who want to be their parents. Miraculous escapes galore occur. The vet and the Fibbie have sex! The kids have sex! Will they catch the bad guys! Duh.Pass on this featherweight (Sorry!)."
3,Question about the bird children books,"I am totally confused. I just read ""When the Wind Blows"" and ""Lake House""...both about the bird children. In browsing through Patterson's books I see where there are seven books in a series, the last being ""Angel"" which seems to be about bird children. Is this series related to characters in ""When the Wind Blows"" and ""Lake House""?"
1,Another good idea bad novel.,"You can look to my review of When the Wind Blows to find my problems with this work. Great idea, horrible everything else. I did not think Mr. Patterson could do any more harm to the idea, he did with this book and that tween nonsense ""Maximum Ride"". Please Mr. Patterson, leave the Sci fi to better authors and keep writing the Alex Cross novels. I guess that is what you are good at."
3,Opinions are bad!!!,"Well, from reading the book to listening to it,it was a thriller from start to finish. I was amazed at how all of the characters progressed, and how it set the standards for the junior series. The evil villian is typical, an whack-job scientist who wants to take control of something bigger than himself.the audiobook was questionable, in quality. All in all though, read When the Wind Blows, first."
1,I guess this is what happens when the author just wants to make money,"This was my first Patterson book. I've been thinking of reading Patterson for many years, mainly because I liked Kiss the Girls and Along came the Spider - the movies based on his books. Needless to say, this book was a total letdown. First off, I did not realize that it was a young adult book, since I have never read any reviews. And don't even get me started on the absurdity of it all - the characters, the plots, the dialogue. The setup of the mystery was actually not that bad, the buildup was tedious,and then it just seems like Patterson got tired of writing, and put the book conclusion into a few pages.Read it if you must, but do yourself a favor and get this book from the library!!!"
1,Bad read,"Bad writing, everything about it is cliche especially dialogue, unrealistic, bad and inconsistent characterization, characters actions, likes, dislikes, and dialogue are not consistent, seems like it was a rushed to finish book, after the main character and the children literally dodged bullets in a sappy romantic scene she asks if she is over reacting about being worried about them being safe as she shrugs off the kids flying around the area which is supposed to be a central dangerous location. Obviously she forgot what had happened literally a day before. I loved some of patterson's other books, this one is terrible, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, I am sure he is not proud of this one. I seriously hated all of the characters. I heard it on audiobook by the way, so maybe hearing it aloud made all of the bad writing mistakes more visible, but either way if you are expecting it to be beach road good, you will be SERIOUSLY disappointed. I wish I would have read this review before wasting my time."
1,Not worth it,"I've probably read about 15 of Patterson's books.This is the FIRST one that I couldn't even get to Chapter 3.I didn't realize when I picked this up at the library, fortunately I didn't buy it, that it was a sequel to ""When the Wind Blows"".Now I know NOT to pick up ""When the Wind Blows""."
1,"James Patterson, PLEASE WRITE YOUR OWN BOOKS","I have been a huge James Patteson fan but now I don't know if I am reading his books or those of a co-author?? This book and the previous one about these bird kids is just plain awful. If I wanted science fiction I would read science fiction. I am into mystery thrillers, and this was not one. The whole premise is ridiculous. Whoever the actual author was, sorry I am not into your type of writing.I have lost a great deal of respect for James Patterson as an author. He has become nothing more than a name on the book of other writers, just a means to sell books. He should return to his writing his own books."
3,Starts strong but fizzles...,"Although I wasn't a great fan of 'When The Wind Blows', I picked up this book just because it was Patterson and I've enjoyed much of his previous work (Alex Cross, 1st, 2nd etc...). I actually enjoyed most of this book but was pretty disappointed with the ending. It just went from 100 mph to zero w/ little explanation or setup. Then it ended. It was almost like he had to start wriring his NEXT book, so he just finished this one haphazardly and moved on. I have to admit though, that I will more than likely purchase future offerings in the hopes that they will be more complete"
1,James Patterson: Go Back to your Day Job,"This was one of the most horribly written books I have ever read. I read some of the paragraphs out loud to my family to show them what poor writing sounds like! I was completely suckered by the television ads hyping this ""chilling"" ""must read"" by this best selling novelist. Shame on me. Shame on you James for succumbing to formula novel writing."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!,"I can usually read almost anything, but I can't even finish this one. I bought this on impulse thinking it was an Alex Cross mystery (which are definitely going downhill also)and was very disappointed to find that it was a sequel to the equally stupid When The Wind Blows. This thing is just boring - don't waste your money or your time! The only Patterson left on my reading list after this will be Richard North, not James..."
1,SELL OUT,"WOW, I READ THIS BOOK IN ONE DAY. AND I THINK I JUST FOUND THE BEST BOOK TO BE CONSIDERED A SELLOUT. MEANING THAT THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE MONEY. THE WRITING IS VERY SUPERFICIAL AND SIMPLE. THE ACTION IS VERY LAUGHABLE AND TWISTS AND TURNS HAPPEN WITH NO EXPLANATION. IT'S LIKE WATCHING A VERY BAD EPISODE OF A BAD TV SHOW.THE PART I LIKE IS THE SCOOP FOR THE REASON THAT IT'S SO GROSS, BUT OF COURSE TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE . I'M A PATTERSON FAN THOUGH. SO I GUESS IT'S FORGIVABLE TO WRITE A PIECE LIKE THIS ONCE IN A WHILE. FOR ANYBODY WHO JUST STARTED READING PATTERSON, TRY HIS OTHER NOVELS. THIS ONE JUST HAPPENS TO BE A VERY BAD FLUKE. BUT I SWEAR HE IS VERY TALENTED ,EVEN THOUGH THE LAKE HOUSE SEEMS LIKE HE'S NOT."
1,Worst book ever written,"The most unbelievable, horribly written book ever. The publishing company must have begged Patterson to write a follow up and he spent about an hour coming up with this dreadful sequel."
1,What a Disappointment!,"I kind of got caught up in the first book,(When the Wind Blows). I thought it was pretty enjoyable. But this one was really bad. The plot (?) if you can call it that, is much too formulaic and the formula is poorly executed and way too obvious. I regretted the time I wasted reading this book. Even the characters lost their charm in this sorry sequel.This was the second novel by Patterson that I have read and it will surely be the last.By contrast I certainly enjoyed Follet's ""Hornet Flight""."
1,Lake House,"I'm a bibliophile who's been reading fiction since 1985, and this book takes the award for the worst novel ever! That says a lot, considering the dreck that my eyes have seen. Simply put: It is sentimental, outlandish rubbish. Patterson needs to team with De Jonge again, because he can't do it alone. Spend your money on Harry Potter for childish fantasy or Harlan Coben for suspense."
1,Zero Stars,"Worst book I have ever read. There is no reality in this book. Bird children with wings who escaped from a horrible hospital that did experiments on them and a psycho 'doctor' chasing after them with armed assasins. Come on... I do like fantasy books at times, but this was impossible to take. There was nothing that I could remotely identify with and I never did connect with any of the characters. I can't believe I actually read the whole thing. I refused to stop reading a book that I had paid for. I had heard of James Patterson before reading this sorry book, and had even seen some movies based on his work. I really expected more from him. But by the end of the story, I hoped that the psycho doctor would catch up to them and kill them all. It was just that bad!"
1,Listless sequel,"I was a bit surprised to see how poor this book was. Like many authors that write a lot of books, James Patterson is in a bit of a rut. However, the stories are still enjoyable, if not outstanding.""The Lake House"" is different, in that you are never drawn into the story. I pushed through reading it, not because I was terribly interested in how it ended, but more out of a morbid curiosity to see if Patterson could suddenly pull a rabbit out of a hat, and entertain me. He couldn't.Save your money/time and skip this one."
1,Absolutely Awful,Don't waste your time with this novel. It is truly the most awful book I have ever read in my life.
1,This book laid an egg!,"I do owe Jim Patterson much credit for my new passion for reading. While taking care of my ill mother, I began reading to deal with some insomnia I was having. I read When the Wind Blows and admit... I enjoyed it. From there, went on to read all the Dan Brown books and some Grishim offerings. I decided to give the Lake House a try thinking it might be fun to revisit the bird clan. Oh God Help Me! This was such a bad read. I really don't understand the entire product placement inserts (M&M's, Nellie, Mountain Dew etc.) it was painful. There is something troubling about reading from the point of view of a 12-year girl and know it's coming from the experiences of a 60+ year old man. In fact, parts of this book don't seem like Patterson wrote it at all. Someone should have told him kids today simply don't act nor speak the way they do in this book. He should end the series here. It's done."
2,"Bad, unfortunately.","I read When the Wind Blows and loved it. Thought it could only get better with part 2- The Lakehouse and rushed out to buy it. Started out that way but then the author (who's normally so good) goes astray and then completely loses it. It made no absolutely no sense. It ultimately leaves you hanging and the characters become so inconsistent and unbelievable its disappointing. Seriously, the way it ends is just ridiculous. I wish I had better things to say b/c I couldn't wait to read this book. But I don't. I'd still read it if you read the first book, just because, but don't expect anything good."
3,I liked it until the end.....,"Like many of the authors that put out several books a year, this one starts out good, gets better and then lays an egg. The end came up quickly and disappointed. I was ready to give this 4 stars, but cannot. The good side, is that you can read this book in a few hours. Why develop a story and then just have it end? Why not write a longer, more involved book that keeps getting better?"
1,Where is Alex Cross?,"I have read everyone one of his books. This is the worst.....Boring, very boring. If Alex Cross does not come back soon I will not buy another of his novels.."
1,Wasted my money,"See, there is this ruthless Dr. Kane who wants to control the world by selling immortality to rich men. He has already made these kids that fly but they have flown the nest and he is trying to kill them before thay spill the beans. Kane has cloned himself so they is more than one bad guy. His wife is a robot that when he turns it on says, ""do me"". The birds kids are ""helped"" by this Veternarian and an FBI agent who are as poorly drawn as any two characters ever in the history of modern fiction.That is the plot. I have read Patterson before and he is usually not too bad. The only thing I can figure is that he was on a period of heavy drink or drugs while working on this one. What is impossible to know is why any self-respecting publisher would put their name on such a book."
1,The Worst,"I don't normally write reviews, but I just had to say, this book was absolutely the worst I've ever read. Is this supposed to be for adults? How can this be such a popular book by someone I thought was a well-respected author? I regret ever picking it up and wish I could get my money back on it. It really deserves less than one star. My advice to others: Don't waste your time!"
1,Shame on James Patterson,"Mr. Patterson's note at the beginning of the book should be a warning to anyone interested in reading it. It is a justification for a terribly written book with an unrealistic and unbelievable plot. As a physician, I can tell tell you that what he claims will ""happen in our lifetime"" is a joke! This book was titled ""Lake House"" for the sole reason of misleading potential buyers. He was obviously hoping to ride the wave of the ""Beach House"" (which I did enjoy). I ""was"" a huge James Patterson fan (even attending his book signings) but he has lost my loyalty with this garbage."
2,familiar ground,"James Patterson has gone off the rails with this book. Revisiting the characters from When the Wind Blows might've seemed like a nice idea since that book is the best selling of all Patterson books. Unfortunately there is nothing new offered with this book. Essenitally the same plot as When the Wind Blows (the children are being stalked by a super-secret madman, while Kit and Frannie try to help). Whereas the Alex Cross series took quite a few books to become tiresome, it's achieved by the second book in this series. I greatly enjoyed the Patterson books of old, when the unexpected often occurred and the endings were unpredictable.....sadly this doesn't live up to his past work."
2,Once I opened it I had no Problem Sleeping,"Unlike the commercial wherein it states something like once you open it you won't be able to sleep -- Unfortunately, this book was a sleeper. I have read many James Patterson books and was quite disappointed with The Lake House. It moved slow even with his short, precise chapters. Nothing really happened in the middle of the book that kept my interst, and nothing scary happened at all. When I finally understood The Resurection nothing came about from it. I love the characters though, like usual with his writing. I have enjoyed many, many of his previous books and was looking forward to enjoying this one as well. It just needed some umph!"
2,The Lake House,"I was so excited to hear that a sequel to ""When the Wind Blows"" was coming out soon that I bought the original in paperback to re-read. After spending my Fourth of July reading the sequel ""The Lake House"" I was so dissappointed that I wish I had read Harry Potter's new book (which I bought at the same time) and skipped ""The Lake House"". The characters are just as loving, different and interesting as the first book but the plot just ...!! The ending was absolutely unbelievable, the rescue was unexplained and not to mention the entire plot, ending and next sequel set-up all happens in the last dozen pages. What a let-down. Mr. Patterson is so much better than this and I hope new readers don't let this mess of a book determine whether they read his other wonderful books."
2,a sequel with room for improvement,"After awaiting publication of this novel, I was disappointed to find it was not a sequel to last summer's ""The Beach House."" The text had too many juvenalities written into it, and the character of Ethan Kane was watered down; he could have given the reader a greater sense of fear. The ending was so sketchy and botched up that a wet band-aid would have held better. But the finale leaves greater room for a sequel than ""When The Wind Blows,"" did, which may tie up the loose ends to this novel. I only hope that the next Alex Cross novel, ""The Big Bad Wolf,""(Nov. 2003) and the new womens murder club novel, 3rd Degree (Mar. 2004) are much better."
1,What was Patterson thinking?!!,"I am a James Patterson fan and normally love his mysteries, but this book is tripe. The introduction to the book says ""When The Wind Blows"" was one of the most widely read and appreciated books around the world. I thought the book ""blows"" for sure. The first was bad enough, but ""Lake House"" is pitiful. I read a little more than half before I gave up. I don't care about any of the characters in this book. Stupid flying kids! Give me a break. Please don't write another in this series."
2,Children's Tale,"I honestly had to check the liner notes to see if I was reading a children's book. The liner notes misled me into reading this waste of time. This is the first book by Patterson that I read, and if it is a legitimate sample of his work, I will not read him again."
2,Having Trouble Believing a Best-Selling Author Wrote This,"I admit, this is the first book I've read by James Patterson. Although I love the Alex Cross movies, I've never picked up one of the books. I must have made a mistake by choosing this to be the first book by Patterson to read. It reads like an amateur wrote it. A book that seems to stutter along. And the ending - I won't disclose that for those who haven't read the book, but it seems like Patterson rushed to tie up loose ends, leaving more questions dangling.Is this one of those books I've heard Patterson is lending his name to? I'd hate to think a best-selling author actually writes like this. Was I disappointed? Yes."
1,Big Dissapointment,"I listened to an audio version of this book and was sorely disappointed. The plot was far-fetched, the characters shallow and the ending far too expedient to be satisfying."
2,Losing control,"I am a relatively recent fan of James Patterson, having read 3 Alex Cross novels. The Lake House is NOT a good book. Having just finished it, I have the strong impression that Mr. Patterson lost control of his story. He created a world of horrific medical experiments and human slaughter and has his heroes trapped deep within the bowels of this world. Then miraculously in the next chapter they are all safe and recovering from the trauma, with no explanation of how they got out. This kind of loss of control of a story reminds me of how I felt when I watched Tom Hank's movie, Castaway. Similar to this book, there was a great story and character development that the directer couldn't figure out how to end. This book was a BIG disappointment. Seems James Patterson was more interested in making money than in writing a good story."
1,Dreadful!,"Do NOT waste your time on this horrible book. It has glaring inconsistencies throughout and I agree with other reviewers who wrote that Patterson seemed to ""phone this one in."" Some of his books are entertaining, some are not: this is by far the WORST of the lot!"
1,--Not worth the time--,"I really enjoyed WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, and was delighted to find that the author had written a sequel; however, this story was a major disappointment and didn't have the thrilling excitement of the first book.THE LAKE HOUSE really left me with a sick kind of feeling and the characters lacked the charisma from the previous book. The story itself was very simplistic and distasteful in many places, but I hung in to the end thinking that maybe something would get better, but it really didn't improve.You won't miss much by skipping this book."
3,Not one of his best,"While this book was not bad it was not one of Patterson's best. There were some interesting twists and turns in this book, but there were also some things that I would have written differently.I still enjoy reading his books, although I am still partial to Alex Cross."
3,3 1/2 unabridged audio,"See book summary above.I actually listened to the whole book on audio and it wasn't easy. I kept expecting something more.It honestly sounded like a romance novel with just a little action. I read the first book of this series many, many books ago and didn't remember much of it...and this book certainly didn't refresh my memory much. If you like romance novels you'll somewhat enjoy this one (even though it's a ridiculous premise--Bird kids?. Yes I know it was all explained in the first novel, but still.)Hopefully Patterson will team up with a better author, such as he did with the novel ""Jester"", and I can start enjoying a Patterson book again."
1,What,"I like James Patterson books, Alex Cross , this one I was like it has to be good, the other books I read by him were. It left me scratching my head wondering what kind of drugs was Mr Patterson taking when he wrote this book. I was very disappointed I couldn't even finish it ."
3,Suspenseful Science Fiction,"James Patterson's book, The Lake House, was rather a surprise since I expected a gripping murder mystery and got a science fiction story about children with wings that could fly. Nevertheless, Patterson grabbed my attention early in the story, and by keeping the chapters short for easy reading and filling the pages with action-packed happenings and/or dialogue, he kept the story moving. While I am not a science fiction fan, the story was interesting enough to keep me reading. The resolution to the plot was a bit downsized--a hospital and many personnel were involved, yet, they weren't part of the resolution--only the man responsible. I think I admired Patterson's writing style more than the story itself, but then that could be because I like his thrillers best."
4,Good story,"I listened to the audio book of this story. This was my very first James Patterson book. I was hooked and found it to be a great listen/read. I think I have figured out why I loved the story - the narrator, Stephen Lang, is just awesome. And I liked the fact that there were 2 narrators - it made it more interesting and entertaining. I really don't have anything bad to say about this audio book version of this story. It was a good pace and kept my interest the entire time. Since I hadn't read any previous books, I cannot compare this as a sequel. But as a book on its own, it was great! Especially with Stephen Lang as the narrator!"
2,The Lake House by James Patterson,This book is a follow up to When The Wind Blows by James Patterson. Kit and Fran try to get custody of the bird children. Many scientists wantthem to perform experiments on.It seems that Patterson strayed away from his usual writing style on this one. I'd recommend that he stick to mystery.
1,Patterson at his worst,"I love James Patterson. His serial kilers are bad to the core and very inetersting, Alex Cross Series- tons of fun and suspence to read but if I came face to face with him now and he asked my humble opinion of Lake House, this would be my advice to him: ""Mr. Patterson, leave the science fiction and supernatural thriller to Dean Koontz and stick to your very interesting but very human psychos and sociopath""."
1,Is it me or are his novels getting worse?,"I rated this book with one star just because there wasn't a zero available. I feel I have incredible patience just to have finished this book.Unfortunately it seems Mr. Pattersons books are declining in quality (and plot)with each passing publication. This was one of the biggest stinkers I have read this year, right up there with ""Prey"" by Crichton.This book had no plot and I had zero emotional investments/interest in the adventure or the characters. Not even Max's teen angst could get through. It moved so quickly and disjointedly that you couldn't keep up. By the end of the book I was hoping they would all perish just to stop another book from ever being published in this series.I would not recommend this book at all unless you like reading stinkers, you masochist you!"
1,"Oh, puleeze!","With all the money he's made, you'd think Patterson could slow down his rate of churning out dopey stuff like this and reach deep down for something that is challenging and satisfying.There are so many other spectacular books out there right now. Spend your money on one of them, instead of perpetuating this kind of drivel."
1,Way Under Water,"Albout halfway through I started thinking Lake House must be an allegory of some kind, that meaning must lie below the surface of this mish-mash of a Angels-versus-Evil Scientist yarn told with a Dick-and-Jane simplicity. But no. Patterson was playing it for real, as though the absurdity of the plot would somehow create a new genre that would be of interest to someone. I have actually read read and quite enjoyed many of the author's earlier mystery-thrillers, although he has never suffered from a complex writing sytle."
1,Yuck,"I am an avid Patterson fan, but I absolutely cannot believe he wrote this book! It was written at an elementary school level and was totally boring. I only finished it because I keept thinking it might get better, but it did not. Patterson has veered away several times from Alex Cross and has done quite well, but this book does not deserve to be a best seller. It is horrible and anyone expecting a page turner, will not get it here."
1,Disappointing,"I really enjoyed When the Wind Blows. It was exciting and the short chapters kept me reading all night. I was thrilled when I heard the sequel was out, but The Lake House is not what I hoped it would be. I didn't care for the foul language for one thing. I read the book just because I had paid for it and I wanted to know what happened, but it was really pretty juvenile and predictable. Don't waste your time!"
1,Hastely Written and Not Entertaining,"I did not read his prior works, but this book was listed in the top 10 of the Bestseller list so I thought it would be good. How wrong I was. The plot is shaky at best and its down right stupid. I have a vivid imagination but still, this book did not do anything for me except make me lose out on 20 bucks. I absolutely hate the stop and go of the story. Each chapter is only 2-3 pages long. The book I had read before this was Harry Potter. I was intrigued how on the very 1st page the author says that ""muggles"" would like this book. How very wrong you were Mr. Patterson, how very wrong you were. Bottom line, don't waist your time, find something betetr."
1,AWFUL...AWFUL...AWFUL!!!,"I am a major James Patterson fan (have read all his books) but this was the absolute worst. I bought this book to read on my vacation and it proved to be a big yawn with a RIDICULOUS plot. However, I stuck it out thinking it would get better...well guess what it didn't.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,"Very, very disappointed","I am a great James Patterson fan. On vacation, I read the Beach House which I thoroughly enjoyed. In my relaxation, I re-read When the Wind Blows and I enjoyed it as much the second time. After completing When the Wind Blows, I realized that the sequel was now available! I rushed out a purchased the hard back thinking that it would be great to learn what happened to Max, Frannie, Kit, and the other kids!! Oh such anticipation! Then I read it.... Oh, such disappointment. All I can really say is - if you can, do not read this book! Keep your memories from When the Wind Blows and let it go at that. The Lake House is just awful - and the ending is so bad, I am still in shock. One dimensional is a nice way to describe what Patterson has done with this story. Hey, James Patterson - think of this as your ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". Pretend it didn't happen and lets move on to the third book that redeems the series! Please!"
1,No logical flow,One of the worst books I have read in a long while. The author took an interest primise and wrote a story that just doesn't flow logically. It seems that he just forgiot to write a few chapters as there is no connection beween events and and implossible events just happen without reason. The end is totally bad!
1,yuk,"This is the fourth Patterson book I've read. I keep reading them because he has bestsellers and I'm trying to figure out how he ever got published. I just don't see it. His plots are sometmes decent, but he's a poor writer with poor grammar, too many references to obscure novelists, incoherant random observations...I just don't see why people read his stuff. This is the last Patterson book I'll read. I've read enough to know that I don't enjoy a story that is poorly written. Lake House is like all the others--a plot that requires you to make a thousand assumptions if you can wade through the grammatical errors."
1,DREADFUL,"It's amazing to me that this book could even get published. If any other author had submitted this manuscript to a publisher it would never ever have gotten to the public. My 10 year old son writes so much better. The characters are one dimensional. The dialogue is ludicrous and poorly written. The story is boring and riduclous. I have read all of Patterson's books. This is by far, one of the worst books I have read in a very long time."
1,Unpoetic,"James Patterson came highly recommended, so when I was at the bookstore the other night and saw The Lake House on sale, I decided to pick it up. Upon reading the first three chapters though, I realized that someone, somewhere had made a grave mistake by allowing this novel to be published. It was just horrible. The prose was choppy, the details were far and few between, and the plot featured holes the size of Wyoming. I thought that perhaps I just had higher standards, that was until I came here and read all these corresponding reviews. Let me tell you, if you're looking for a good suspense with a believable plot, read Grisham or even Crichton. I just hope Patterson's other novels weren't this bad."
1,Fly It Away!,"I have to admit, this was the first James Patterson novel I've read. And, I picked it up on a bargain table. So, I guess I shouldn't have been too disappointed.Still, I liked the film versions of ""Kiss The Girls"" and ""Along Came A Spider"" enough to hope for more.It wasn't until I began reading that I realized this was a sequel. I'm not particularly a fan of fantasy but I'm not sure this even deserves that classic a category.The comic book plot with its stereotype characters made me wonder if he wrote this for children. Then I came to the sex scenes and thought, no, he meant this for adults.Well, I guess someone as prolific as Patterson has to be allowed a bomb now and again. I won't rule him out. But, I think I'll be more selective and read a few pages before buying."
5,So Different!,"I was afraid I would not enjoy this book because it was so different from his usual series.I could not put the book down. I really enjoyed the twists and turns and though the plot was not very challenging, the characters were incredible and it left me wanting more."
1,It Will Only Make you Dumber,"One of the worst books I have ever read. It only took me 3 days but it was horrible. Patterson has really dropped off. Loved Jack & Jill and some of the other Cross novels but lately he's putting out too much material, too fast."
1,Patterson not up to par,"Have read and enjoyed most of Patterson's books. Lake House, however, was perhaps the greatest waste of time ever spent in reading.The plot is outlandish, not even remotely interesting. It should have been billed as comic book science fiction, and never should have been published by a respectable publishing house.I have rated a number of Patterson's books as excellent in the past.This one is so bad I will never read another. He wrote the Beach House with a co-author - it is hard to imagine that he wrote this himself, or let his name be attached to it."
1,aaawful,"I can't believe the garbage this man is writing. I can't believe there is a publisher out there who thinks this is worth publishing. Patterson could write a grocery list and everyone would line up, eager to spend the money and time to get through this drivel. His writing is continually vapid and juvenile. If you want to read a great book, you won't find it under the name of james patterson. i didn't even want to give this a star, but that is the lowest they allow."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Bird children? Cloned people? Children with wings? Weird experiments?Are you kidding? Is this really a book? Who buys this? Me, obviously. I took the reputation of Patterson and thought since I so much enjoyed The Beach House, I'd have to like a book called The Lake House...boy was I wrong."
1,Too slow,"I am only going to finish listening to this audio book in hopes the ending will be decent but I don't expect much. It seems like the author took two completely different but interesting story lines and meshed them inexpertly. I like the idea behind the bird children and the Hospital but the inane dialog, weak character development, and bad decisions made by the characters are just weights that drag this book down almost beyond redemption."
2,The Lake House,"I've read and completed The Lake House. I thought it was supposed to be coming out in movie form and wanted to read the book first. Where's the movie???? Anyway, it was an interesting story, but I was insulted as a reader. I thought it was more geared for adolescent reading. James did more telling than showing and I found there were too many references to songs and it irritated me. The best thing about this book was that it was, indeed, a fast read and I could move on to more sophisticated styles of writing."
1,SORRY JAMES..BUT ONLY 1 STAR,"I hate to give a bad review for a book, but this book totally deserves it. I have been behind on my reading so I just got to this book that has been sitting on my shelf for a few months. I read this book in two days and hated every minuet of it. It was a boring book, with no excitement in it in my opinion. The plot was simple and boring. After reading this book and THE JESTER, I'm hoping that Patterson's new Alex Cross novel The BIG BAD WOLF that's coming out in November will be a lot better than his last two novels."
1,When the Book Blows,"Thriller? Huh? Whaaaaat?Great book if you have ADD. You can review the last six chapters from where you left off (all 11 pages), and not get too lost. The plot, the premise, and the players were all ridiculous. I had to force myself to finish this book, because I couldn't believe that by the 96th chapter I still was not ""thrilled"". This book was terrible, right down to the last page."
1,Enough of the wings,"I love James Patterson's books, EXCEPT the two with the ""Wing Theme"". Wish he'd go back to his wonderful true to life mysteries that I stay up half the night reading. I miss Alex Cross! I thought The Lake House would at least be comparable to The Beach House which IMO was excellent. I must admit though that I didn't finish The Lake House so perhaps one star isn't fair to this Patterson book."
2,GIVE ME PETER PAN,"It's sad to see a talented writer like James Patterson write such a trite, dull and laughable novel. I've loved his Alex Cross books and while I found WHEN THE WIND BLOWS whimsical and different, this follow up is a real dud.First of all, enough flying narratives. Patterson fills the book with so many ridiculously redundant scenes of the kids flying around and then he has the audacity to bump one of them off. (Sorry for the spoiler, but I won't tell you which one). The whole concept becomes so frustrating that by the time they face the mad Dr. Ethan Kane, one is totally apathetic. Frannie and Kit are soporific to say the least. All the pop cultural references are amateurish and remind me of stories I wrote when I was in my creative writing class.James, do us and yourself a favor: end this debacle and stick to Cross. Thank you!"
1,Simply Unreal,"I have never written a review for Amazon before, but I feel compelled to do so after reading this book. I read the large print edition, and there was so much missing in the book (such as character and story development), I thought my version had to be abridged, and a very poor effort at that. I could find no mention of it being a condensed book on the copyright page (or anywhere else on the book), so I came to Amazon to check out the facts. Imagine my surprise when reading the reviews to find that others felt the same way as I did. I really enjoyed When The Wind Blows, and waited anxiously to read another book about the children. I have read many of the books by James Patterson and find it impossible to believe that he really wrote this book. Sometimes I will accept less character development if the story is engrossing, but I can't accept a story line with holes as large and jagged as the Rocky Mountains. Really, really unbelievable, on many levels!"
1,Glad I got it from the library!,"I have enjoyed Patterson's Alex Cross books but this effort is simply terrible. Consider this short piece of a phone conversation between the narrator and Max, a 12-year-old bird-girl with an IQ that supposedly is so high it can't be measured:""Max's voice suddenly choked up. 'I gotta go.''Max, what is it? What's going on? There's something else, isn't there?''I can't talk about it. Can't,"" she said. ""But it hurts so much to keep it a secret. It's bad, Frannie. Sorry, sorry, I've gotta go.''What are you talking about, Max? You're rambling. Slow down, honey.'""RAMBLING? SLOW DOWN? Is this author paying any attention at all? Not only that but the type is huge and the chapters are only a few paragraphs long, a blatant attempt to get a lot of money for not very much. Fortunately it was the library's money, not mine."
1,A thoughtless sequel,"I have become disappointed with Mr. Patterson's latest works. He seems to have gotten lazy - not explaining things, not resolving situations, etc. This is all that is bad about him rolled into one place. I enjoyed When The Wind Blows, but this book just blows. It is as if he were persuaded to write a sequel, and he decided to just knock it off in a weekend. The ""Resurrection"" part of the story appears to be an unfinished product he had laying around that he just stuck in to the new book. I'm sure that he could have done a much better job with this if he had just put some thought into it."
1,Not a winged victory....,What could have been a decent premis of a plot was drastically reduced to drivel by way of its pitifully sophmoric delivery.
1,The Lake House,"I'm a bibliophile who's been reading fiction since 1985, and this book takes the award for the worst novel ever! That says a lot, considering the dreck that my eyes have seen. Simply put: It is sentimental, outlandish rubbish. Patterson needs to team with De Jonge again, because he can't do it alone. Spend your money on Harry Potter for childish fantasy or Harlan Coben for suspense."
1,One of the worst!,"If I could give a negative star rating I would do a -5! This has got to be one of the worst books James Patterson has put out. It is extremly boring! It takes entirely too long to get to the point. The whole story concept is just lame! If you are a James Patterson fan, skip this one and go to the next one."
1,Please don't buy this book,"I hated this book. I have read all of James Patterson's books, and this is not even close to par with his other books. And where did all the product placement come from? Practically every page has some product description...Ipods, Nikes, IMacs, you name it, it's hyped. This book seems like it's written more as screenplay than a novel. The character development is crude, very crude. Nothing likeable about any of the characters. And the ending is absolutely illogical. I mean, even if you just accept all the facts as presented, it still does not add up. Not his best effort. I won't bash him though, he has provided me with many great reading hours."
1,Hurry up and finish so you can go on to something better,"I have only read two Patterson books that I did not like....Lake House and Cradle and All. I did not like the story, the characters or the writing at all. I really enjoy the Alex Cross and the Women's Murder Club books, but this is so very different. I stayed up to finish it so that I could move onto something more worth while."
1,Awful!!!,"I am SO glad I got this from the library instead of buying it. Every so often an author you love goes off on a weird streak and writes the most awful garbage... does anyone remember Patrricia Cornwell's dreadful ""Isle of Dogs""? I have stopped reading her, and if this is an example of Patterson's future works, I will stop reaging hin also. A WASTE OF TIME!!!"
1,disappointing,I used to love james patterson's books and i wish he'd go back to his previous type of novel.. this stuff is just a bit over the top for my taste.. flying kids.. yuk
1,I have a theory....,"I have a theory.... that this book, like the one before, are actually written by a much younger author... an adolescent or young adult. Patterson's writing in his other books shows him to be a more mature author, with complex characters and many more shades of grey. This book is just too simplistic, the characters are two-dimensional, the plot predictable, with no subtlety or complexity. Not a bad effort for a young author, but nowhere near what we know Patterson is capable of."
1,How bad can novels get?,"Never have I read such drivel. I recently read Beach House, that, while poorly written, at least was readable. This trite nonsense is not. If I could give it 0 stars (or negative stars) I certainly would. What is the readership that this book is addressed to? Some of it is gruesome, and some of it sounds like it's pitched to pre-adolescents. My advise, don't waste your time, even on the beach."
3,Good but could be better...,"I must admit that I actually enjoyed When the Wind Blows and this one, The Lake House. But I was a bit dissappointed with the end of The lake House. It went along smoothly but in the end it seemed as if he ran out of thoughts or time. There should be a few more chapters toward the end that aren't there. I felt a little jipped. Also if you read Maximum Ride and its sequel which are also very good, keep in mind that the characters are not related. Maximum from When the Wind Blows and The Lake House is not the same Maximum that is in Maximum Ride and the other children though similar are not the same either. Not sure why he did this, but as seperate stories they are pretty good."
1,A disappointment.,This book doesn't even compare to When the Wind Blows. I LOVED When the Wind Blows but Lake House was a bore. It seems Patterson was in a hurry to follow up with a sequel and this was hardly worth the time.
1,The worst!,"James Patterson was a very good author. I have read every one of his books in hardcover and have always anxiously awaited his next offering. Until I read ""Lake House"".An embarrassement. No redeeming values.This Patterson is off my list. Permanently (like Sanders and Ludlum)."
1,Big Waste of Time,This has got to be one of the worst books that I have read in a long time. It was not plausible because there were so many missing explanations. How did they escape from the hospital? The only good thing was that I bought this book for $.50 at a book sale.
1,Such a stupid book!,"Man, I had not read the prequel to this book, and i read the description. wow, i thought i was really going to read a very disturbing novel. which i usually love novels that disturb me and give me shivers. But this was such a stupid book. About some kind of mutant children. i thought james patterson was a good author. hah. he must have been stoned when wrote this book. about children with wings. It was not really boring, it was just stupid. too far out there. this is more like a kids comic book, with fantasy creatures. I could not finish it. I think i will stick with the alex cross series. i read mary mary before i read any other patterson books and i could not put it down, wish i could say the same about the lakehouse. dont waste your time trying to enjoy this book"
1,Blarg!,"I enjoyed ""When the Wind Blows"". This sorry excuse for a follow-up had me in pain, until I dropped the cover and tossed it.This isn't even worthy of one star, but amazon doesn't allow for zero ratings."
4,Very good tape,"I found the poses in this tape really good and varied. It wasn't just another take on the sun salutation. Her voice is wonderful and grounded and she speaks with calm authority. The only problem I found was with the music. It starts out with calm music that complements, but does not intrude upon the instruction. Then, once the poses become more energetic, the music changes into an unsettlingly loud genre which made it really impossible for me to continue. A couple of years later, I found this tape in DVD and was able to turn off the music and still hear the instruction, enalbing me to use this wondertul program."
1,Very poor device and wrong working,"I got really disappointed with this player. First of all, it is randomly/occasionally capable to write en memory cards. I have 2 memory cards: a 512MB Kingston which it sometimes, depending on this device humour, can write on it; and a 1GB Sandisk in which I could never write a single byte with this vulgar device.It also has a very poor functionality. It doesn't navigate folders, it doesn't show ID3 tags (song/artist)... and even buttons for handling volume and for tracking songs are the same!!In conclusion, this product is a real shame. Stay away!!"
2,fair,"Clock only chimes once in a while. To begin with we could not make it chime at all, but about a week ago it just started chiming on its own. We haven't bothered it in weeks but all of a sudden one morning it actually chimed at 7:00 am and then skipped several hours and chimed once again. Now it just chimes an hour here ant there but not regularly. It was a big disappointment."
5,Great album,"I can play this over and over. ""Down at J.J's"" is my favorite but I like all of them. Toe-tapping!"
1,leather strip + skinny puppy= hocico,"I am a fan of Skinny puppy; I used to be one of Leather strip, but I still like some of their songs; these, together with Yelworc, are the main influences acknowledged by this mexican band. But Hocico is a bad band, in my opinion obviously. They lack ideas, I'm not a purist, and I know not every band can crate their own style, but it's just that Hocico usually tend to copy other bands (Wumpscut, Leather Strip) but they make it bad; I will explain: I think they only achieve to follow the darker sides of these said bands, but they are unable to get the subtleties hidden under Puppy's music, for instance. The first song, instrumental, is really a very good one; but the rest are so purposely agressive that they get a blurred image of other bands and sound sometimes ridiculous."
5,Play by Jeff Kashiwa,"I have listened to this cd 4 times now and every time I listen to it, I find something new to like."
5,a great CD,"Kashiwa is amazing. I got this CD as a gift for a Rippingtons fan, and it was a huge hit -- we all listened to it over and over. Kashiwa was part of the Rippingtons, and if you like their sound or are interested in beautiful, complicated jazz or just simple easy-listening from talented musicians, you should give this CD a shot. I would recommend it to any musician or music-lover."
4,Royo's Proven Again He's the Best,"I have absolutely no care for tarot, I have absolutely no belief in the rubbish that is often ""told in the cards,"" and I care even less for the history of tarot. That is not why I bought this book. I bought this book because it is Luis Royo, the best fantasy artist out there at this time, whose haunting imagery, beautiful ladies, and horrid beasts have covered so many of todays top fantasy and sci-fi writers' dust jackets.And this book must be added among the list of his best works because of the change of style he has taken to do this book. Each new painting is a card in the tarot, and he brings it to life, even for skeptics, though without his paintings it would be lost entirely to me. I recommend this book to those of you who love Royo, Heavy Metal, or are a fan of fantasy art in some way. Note that this book contains nudity and sex."
3,"Interesting documentary, but one big problem","The topic of this documentary about Glenn Gould's trip to Russia is definitely a fascinating one, but I was disappointed to discover that there are no uninterrupted segments of Gould's playing. When they do show such footage, it is brief and people talk over it. I know that there are other DVDs that feature his playing, and it is one of these others that I wish I had purchased in the first place."
3,okay,The texture and flavor of these bars don't go well together. The berry bliss and the chocolate charger are much much better.
4,Great book - a must read for anyone thinking about reduction.,"Overall, this is a very good book to read when you're trying to make the decision. Honestly, there's not much out there (at least from what I could find), so it really felt great to get my hands on such a comprehensive source.I read so much and talked to so many people online that I thought I'd go crazy trying to make the decision - you can't tell which end is up when you get overloaded. So, this book was very helpful in my journey to make my decision. I, personally, ended up not going through with the surgery, but I learned a ton through the process of thinking about it.Good wishes to all of you ladies out there wrangling with this decision."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"According to the Amazon.com Review by Emily Bedard, quote ""This piece rests on weighty, goldtone brass base for stability"" unquote. I doubt that there is a piece of ""brass"" anywhere in the clock which I received. It is nothing but plastic with some silicon innards under glass. It is so light (unweighty) and unstable that I do not dare display it in a draft or in the vicinity of my curious cats. I was embarrassed to present it to my wife as a gift. Had she not been present and aware of its arrival I would have buried it in the backyard and never mentioned it to her."
1,The Essential Event planning Kit,"I have one word for this book...TERRIBLE!!! Save your money! I can't believe someone allowed this book to be published...If you are looking for a book that leaves you confused, then this is the book for you!"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this ""event planning kit."" It did not contain any useful information at all."
1,This book sucks!,"You know I bought this book because I mistakingly saw the Amazon reviews..but what I read was the published reviews (which must get a kiok back or something). Anyone, and I mean, ANYONE could write this book, because there is NO WRITING. It's a book of forms, lame ones at that. Like a To Do List? Date - What to do - Who do you need help to Get it Done - Done checkmark.Wow! That was deeeeeep insight.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Go out to lunch instead and spend the $6-$8. I would rate this book a zero star if I could."
5,A Great Tool Box of Essential Event Planning Tools!,"I've been deeply involved with event planning as a professional florist, a seminar leader for Tony Robbins & Dale Carnegie, and a tour guide for destination management companies. So this book (3rd edition) comes in real handy for me.The book is a collection of 11 easy to use charts, tables, diagrams, and lists that are essential for thorough planning of any event like a weddings, party, seminar, conference or ceremony. While there isn't a lot of text, the book is pretty self-explanatory.You could buy other books that have a lot written about what to do in this area, but here is a simple one that has all that you need to have a stress-free function within budget.I think every professional florist, photographer, caterer, banquet manager, or full-service hotel should have a copy of this book on hand. It is certainly money that is well-spent."
2,Weak event planning kit.,"Maybe this book would be good for someone who has never planned an event before, but I found it was just a little common sense and a bunch of charts."
1,Realy a nice junk book,"Nothing inside, nothing usefull, 9$ for nothing.All my applause to be such a good salesman, you could sell fridge in north pole ! But for event planing.....All what is essential in this book is to not buy it!"
1,Dissapointing,Return Fire I was an amazing game that was exciting and enjoying to play in a multiplayer setting. This game was extremely dissapointing with bad graphics and bad game play. Highly not recommended.
4,Perfect book for those wet behind the ears!,"When I started reading this book, I was wet behind the ears. This book helped me get on track to my MCSE. It taught everything you need to know in order to pass the MCSE test. It will give you a good knowledge of Neworking technologies OLD and NEW!"
2,Some real review,I didn't like this book. With all the respect I think it's very shallow on most of subjects and not enough even to refresh your knowledge. I think I've wasted my money ( and I did it again with ExamCram NT Server in Enterprise ) so I recommend <Networking Essentials exam guide> by Dan York (see my review about) as solid study guide to start with. Passed NetEss with huge score but ExamCram was not the key to success. Good luck !
1,"BAD END PRODUCT, FAULTY SCIENCE, ICS IS GOOD, BUT THIS IS BAD INFO","Study, because knowledge is power. Efficacious ICS is clear. The author attaches a color chart to measure the PPM. What? Throw the stuff out and DON'T mix any kind of salt with SILVER IONS! DANGEROUS!-This book is NOT GOOD SCIENCE!ICS works, but a telephone cord? Give me a break!"
5,Cloud 8 is tremendous,"Grant Bailie is a true star, with a unique style. I laughed, I cried, I was pleasantly puzzled. This remarkable look at the afterlife is one of the most fast-paced, intriguing and best books I've ever read.If you enjoy great storytelling and unique viewpoints, read Cloud 8 today.I'm not sure Bailie can top this phenomenal work, but I can't wait to see how he tries."
2,Just my opinion,"The jokes are OK even though dated which was to be expected. However, expected more main stream of the Catskills - missing the big places, i.e. Concord etc. and the comedians who made the big time that started there. These were second string performers; having said that the disc was worth the money. But, PBS has shown better stuff from time to time."
3,Entertaining but dated,"This was an enjoyable DVD but the humor has a limited appeal because it is so narrowly focused on Jewish humor. The comedians are exceptionally talented but their topics are, because of the audience, narrowly circumscribed."
4,Panetonne When You Want,"I looked forward to the holidays every year just so I could buy the Panetonne in the grocery stores. Then I found the Panetonne baking moulds on Amazon and now I can have it any time I feel like baking, without all those preservatives. Easy to use and looks professional. I like the 6 3/4"" size but also use the smaller sizes when giving as gifts."
3,beavis and butt-head gameboy,the beavis and butt-head game is not the way you think it would be.you go around in a maze and have to try to find items like base balls and stuff. i love the show but the game it's that fun.
1,bad game,that is the worst game in the world for kids teens buy it but kids dont make your mom buy all this money for that trust me
5,OUTSTANDING!!!! SCRUMMMDELICIOUS!!!!!! SIMPLY A MUST HAVE!!,"Well folks, the wait is over!!!! I picked up this book as a birthday present for myself and loved it so much, I went back for 3 more. (GUESS WHAT EVERYONE IS GETTING THIS YEAR AS GIFTS). I've been a Patti LaBelle fan about 15 yrs now, and see her in concert at least 2 time a year. Now I feel like I'm having dinner with the DIVA, 1 on 1 (I""M IN HEAVEN :-) ). MUCH LUV 4 U PATTI !!! SMOOOOOOCHES, Ian"
5,Girlfriend can cook!,"Just looking at these recipes makes my mouth water. I only wish I had a bigger kitchen! I just got this so I haven't started cooking yet, but if the recipes are anywhere near as delicious as the stories are wonderful and touching (esp. Barbara's Friend Egg Sandwich), I am about to put on another 10 pounds. And have a LOT of fun doing it!"
2,disappointed,"I first reviewed this and said I wished there was a gift option. Now through further interaction with the owner, I am MORE disappointed and until the owner honors his own words, I will not recommend the company to anyone."
4,Great cookbook for delicious comfort food......,I have had this book for years.....she has great recipes for many go-to dishes that you will make over and over again....Great addition for your cookbook collection.
2,Very disappointed,"I heard so much about Ms. LaBelle's cooking that I couldn't wait to get her cookbook before the holidays. I'm no stanger to Southern cooking being as I'm from Alabama, but I figured maybe she could help to give me new ideas or a new twist on the things I already know how to make. Well, that was not the case. It seems like Ms. LaBelle is just giving you the bare basic recipes for how to make the items in her book. For a person who can't cook this would be a great place to start, and then as you get better you can build on some of these receipes. For a person who can already cook, this book is just a waste of time and money. That is just my opinion though. The recipes prepared as is, are very bland."
5,Enjoyed going through this book and bookmark the ones I'm going to try. The stories and photos were great.,Enjoyed going through this book and bookmark the ones I'm going to try. The stories and photos were great. I ordered this book because I love Mrs. Labelle music and read how she cooks for her crew on the road. She's a classy lady and knows her stuff. I'm a southern girl and like to try different southern twist to old favorites. Great cook book. Thank you for sharing some of your families favorites.
5,My Go-To Cookbook,This is my favorite cookbook. I have tried about 50% of the recipes and have not been disappointed. I get rave reviews on the finished product. Tried the bread pudding recipe for Father's Day and the positive remarks have not stopped.
3,Best rum cake ever!,the recipe for the scandalously rich rum cake...is the best rum cake I have ever tasted from a box mix.
5,Food for the soul and the soulful,I think that Ms. LaBelle has really outdone herself. The book showed the Pattie we all know and love. There was nothing to leave to the imagination therefore an inexperienced cook will stand less of a chance to make a mess. I will display this wonderful book amongst my other treasures. This book is a must buy.GOOD JOB GIRL!!!! Alice Walker
5,LOVE IT!!,IF YOU ARE READING THIS POST BUY THIS BOOK! The recipe's are soo good and very flavorful!I've been looking around on other seasonings and I wanted to know has anyone heard of Annabelle's Soul Food Seasoning? I've tried it at my sister's house and it was SOOO good but i havent seen it in stores if anyone has knows where to get some please let me know...
5,This book contains wonderful solo or group projects.,"Dina, George and I had a wonderful party, just creating the Mac & Cheese. The instructions were easy to follow and the end product was delicous. The recipes, under Patti's guidance, were also very easy to adjust to accommodate both diet and taste. Patti, you worked it babe. Thanks"
5,Excellent Cookbook! I also sent it to my two best friends..,"So far the recipes I've tried are very good. This is down home cooking for sure and mainstream enough for everyone to try. I'm from San Francisco but living in Tampa, Florida and Ms. La Belle's food spans coast-to-coast. I thought it was so good I sent it to to my friends back in California."
4,Fantastic,"It was so rewarding reading and following all the receipes in this book. I felt like Patti was right there in the kitchen with me. My husband absolutely loved the ""say my name smothered chicken and gravy!"""
4,I am singing,"While I have not really read the stories, I have enjoyed the recipes. Everyone loved my macaroni and cheese."
4,great live Toad,"This live album captures Toad in their early days, yet there's enough of the early hits to appeal to anyone. They'd still have a couple of great albums after this live show, so it doesn't really count for a ""greatest hits live"" (maybe something they can do in the future). All of the songs from the Fear album featured on this one are excellent versions. I saw them recently in 2011 and have to say this band has only gotten better. The All you Want greatest hits disc is a nice look at the re-recorded hits by a stronger more evolved band. But this disc serves a fun early introduction to Toad's music and shows how great they've always been live."
2,Not what I thought,"This book is not as interesting as I thought it would be. I bought it to look at and share with my son, but it is really more scientific than I wanted. and the binding is falling apart even though we hardly used it."
1,Great idea; weak execution,"As a mystery fan, I love the idea behind You've Got Murder - an Artificial Intelligence Personality (AIP) as detective. Turing Hopper, the AIP in question, is sentient enough to realize something is wrong when her programmer, Zack, goes missing. Enlisting the help of two human friends, she uses her considerable computing power to solve his disappearance. Like I say, this is a fresh idea, the author has a talent with words, and Turing and her friends are likeable characters. But to enjoy fiction, you must be willing to suspend disbelief. Too often in this book, I found myself thinking, ""Naw, this is nonsense."" Authors should not try to fake what they don't really know."
4,Good shredder,Shredder is compact and does a pretty good job for the small amount of paper I shred.I have noticed that it does jam more than it probably should even with less than 6 sheets of paper.It is just a basic shredder so don't expect too much.
1,don't buy this product,This piece of junk started off working poorly and within 3 days gave up the ghost and only makes rumbling noises--I will never buy another such.Dr. C. G. Chentnik
4,Fudge-A-Mania,You should read Fudge-A-Mania because it is funny. Fudge has a older brother who think he is a brat. Fudge's brother gets a turtle. What happens next you will have to find out on your own. Read this book.
4,Good book,This book was a reading assignment for my 7 year old son and he really enjoyed reading this book for school.
5,Child Disaster Strikes Again,"AAAAAAAA! To Peter Hatcher AAA is right. Peter finds out he will be spending 3 whole weeks at a summer house in Maine with the Cootie Queen herself Sheila Tubman , his arch nemesis. Than the child disaster Pete's five year old brother. He finds relief when his best friend can come but not for a while. The worst thing of all is Fudge plots to marry Sheila, can anything be worse, sure and does. Just see!"
5,Best of the three books Blume has written about Fudge.,"Fudge is back with even more. The Hatcher family is going to Maine and their next door neighbors will be Shiela Tubman, Peter's enemy. First, Sheila gets a job babysitting Fudge. Fudge and Sheila might get married. As it turns out, Peter and Fudge's grandma gets married with Sheila's grandpa. It is a really good book."
5,i love fudge a mania,fudge a mania is soooo funy omg i could not stop reading it tons of laughs i love this book a must read
4,Not the best Fudge book,"I grew up reading Judy Blume's books. I read this one recently while tutoring a 6th grader. She loved it. Fudge is still funny and keeps your interest. Peter is still relatable and it is interesting to see how he has ""grown"" up. His relationship with Sheila is still a central piece of the book and they have just the right amount of tension to keep things fun and light-hearted. A great book for upper Elementary School kids and lower Middle Schoolers."
4,show,show the real book with 145 pages i love the book so far but i am only on page29and i want it on the kindel PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Don't waste your time on other nasty old books!!!,"MatheoFourth grade level book.What a messy vacation! Peter is going to spend all summer vacation in a communicating house with his biggest enemy, Sheila Tubman otherwise known as the queen of cooties. Lucky for him, his parents said hat he could ask a friend to come with him and Peter chose Jimmy Fargo with his father. But what a mess! On the fifth day of the first week,Peter went outside at six PM to look for a bird who in fact stayed in the house. But will Peter win at the Sunday baseball game?I recommend this book to people who like to laugh a lot because there are a lot of plays on words."
3,Fudge a mania,"Book review JeremyShelton Fudge a mania In the beginning of the story Fudge told his brother that he is going to marry Sheila. And peter is going to Maine for three weeks. Then twards the middle of the story peter, fudge, Sheila and peters mom went to their grandma's house. Then Mr. Fargo calls and asks peters mom to give directions for Mr. Fargo so he can come to the house. Then a couple hours later fudge notices that Mr. Fargo was here. Oh and Pete, fudge, Sheila and Pete's mom are staying at their grandma's house for three weeks. Then Jimmy comes over and says there too. Then they all went sail boating for a while. Everybody was getting hungry on the boat. Then everybody had lunch. Then they hit some tite rapids. Then they got back and Mr. Fargo picked them up in his truck. Then at the very end of the story Peter's grandma and Buzzy Senior got married. They had a big wedding barbecue and it lasted for hours. Then everybody was tired. The end"
5,Fudge buying his mitt-si,Well I rate this book five stars because Fudge bought a glove and his friend Mittzi had one and she named it mitt-zi so Fudge named it mitt-zi too. I also liked the book because they all had ice cream and it made me hungry.It was funny when Peter swallowd a flie when he was riding his bike.I really liked this book a lot.I hpoe you have fun reading this book.
1,It just wasnt my kind of book.,"This atrocious sequel is a waste of time and money. The vocabulary used in this book was simply treacherous, it was as if it were written by a ten year old. The character of Fudge is obviously just a spoiled brat who is under the impression that it is humorous to misbehave. This lengthy novel lacks interesting characters and plot is completely nonexistent, i thouroughly enjoy all of Blume's other wonderful novels but this pitiful story definitely fell short."
1,Horrible condition.,"Calling this ""good"" condition was pretty much a lie. Badly dog eared - more like big folds -- in the cover -- which had ink stains and library stickers all over it. One and done with with this vendor."
1,I never received it!,"I keep hearing positive feedback about this person, but for some reason I never received my book that I ordered a month and a half ago. How hard is it to put a small book into the mail and get it there within a couple of weeks, but a month and a half?"
4,Fudge -A-Mania,"Fudge-A-Mania ,a fiction book by Judy Blume, is all about this five year old boy named Fudge. He plans to go to Maine and spend three whole weeks with the Tubmans. Peter is Fudge's brother. Fudge, his mother, father, Toosie, and Muriel all went to Maine because they are going on a family vacation.This book is good because it's funny. I also like it because my favorite parts are when Sheila was trying to tie a ribbon around Turtle's neck but Turtle kept drooling. Also when Fudge ate to many raspberries and he got sick.I think other people will like the book Fudge-A-Mania because it's silly and fun to read. La'Lonnie W.A"
4,Stone Fox,"Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner is a realistic story about a kid named Little Willy and his Grandfather who live on a potato farm. One day Grandfather gets sick because he didn't pay his rent. So Little Willy, who's ten years old, takes care of Grandfather and his farm.StoneFox is a good book because it tells an excellent story that will make you cry. I recommend Stone Foxbecause you will want to read it over and over again. -Mondy Cameau"
4,Fudge a mania,"Fudge a Mania by Judy Blume is about the Hatchers and the Tubmans moving to Maine. In the story Fudge eats blueberries and turns blue. Also Sheila gets a dog named Jake. Sheila sister Libby works at an ice cream shop.This story's theme is it's good to be creative. Also your family might be annoying, but you should still love them. Fudge is always driving Peter crazy, and Peter makes fun of Fudge, but they're still brothers.I like this book because Peter makes fun of Fudge. Also I like Fudge's bird Uncle Feather who says, ""Bonjour stupid."" I think people should read it because it's funny and also a great book."
1,Living History,"Get real. Read Hell to Pay by Barbara Olson, High Crimes and Misdemeanors by Ann Coulton or Dereliction of Duty by Robert Patterson. Then decide for yourself if you want to read Hillary's fictional book."
5,Great Read! Finally we get the TRUTH!,Great book! Loved getting the REAL story behind the slanted media version of what we are fed on the 6 o'clock news. Wonderful insight to the real human side of their White House life. Warm and colorful! It makes me long for the good ole days when Clinton was in the White House and we all had money and the rest of the world didn't hate us!
5,Honest & Informative,"Hurrah for Hillary! This is a book about a brave and intelligent woman doing what comes naturally to her... defending the rights of women and children all over the world while fighting off some of the cruelest and unwarranted attacks in Washington. I urge every woman to read this book. Anyone who is a mother, daughter or wife will find something of value here.If I could rename this book, I would call it ""Superwoman"". This is Hillary's story... it's who she I enjoyed every moment of it."
5,"Well written, articulate and honest","I found the book, Living History to be interesting, educational, and believable. Ms. Clinton writes well and includes her perspective on all of the events that we were all very much aware of during the Clinton presidency and beyond.The book includes Ms. Clinton's feeling and perspective of the events that took place. So I was dismayed to read the rantings of the Hillary bashers who reviewed this book. I didn't see these types of rants on other books written by conservative authors such as Ann Coulter (who states her opinion) that I feel was filled with innacuracies and poorly written.For the Hillary bashers, this book will not change their mind (shame on you). But for those of us who were either straddling the fence, or behind her from the start, the book will be met met with accolades.Read this book with an open mind and you will find that it is well worth your time and the money spent on the book."
5,Surprisingly pleased!,"For a skeptic, I found Hillary's book well written, albeit some parts ghost-written (as is very common even with prolific writers). Throughout the book, with its vast recent history and current events, there is a thread of integrity that amazed me. If this book is a sample of her campaign style (what campaign?), then bring it on!"
1,"Poor, poor Hillary got rich on fools buying this joke!","Either Hillary is sadly out of touch with the real world or just stupid. I don't buy the victim that she want us to believe. Sorry, one again she is laughing all the way to the bank at our expense. Anybody want to buy my copy cheap?"
1,Boring! An Assault on the Senses,"I just finished this book....which is a feat unto itself. There are about 30 some odd pages of worthwhile information. The rest of the book reads like a high school girl's diary. ""I was really concerned about the attacks from the right,"" but then, ""ohmygod, I took a trip with Chelsea to Albania."" WHAT?? This is supposed to be the world's most intelligent women on the eve of perhaps becoming our first female president? Yikes! Hopefully for her, she didn't write it. Hopefully, she didn't even see it before it went to press. It's a poorly written campaign add. It skewers the truth. It's much ado about nothing. Pick up ""Dereliction of Duty"" instead if you want some real insight."
3,Political Polarization,"The reviews are typical of our society today. You'll notice most are 1 or 5 stars and every one of you is responsible for the degradation of political discourse today. Not the politicians - you. The politicians only sell what the public buys within their own ideological framework. And the politicians and talk shows sell the American political equivalent of the Roman games. And we buy it. I haven't read the book yet but you can be sure I will read it with the intent of learning something and then make a judgment. Our national discourse and ability to judge objectively is deteriorating to the point it is nonexistent and people like you are prime examples. Who among you has actually read that loooong book so shortly after it was published? None.You with your inability to think for yourselves and reason responsibly are what is ruining America. Not Democrats, not Republicans, but you."
1,Why haven't we had enough of this woman yet?,"Here we have a woman who has written a totally self-serving book and for the privelege of reading it, we must pay money. Isn't that just a little bit twisted, folks? There's lots of good fiction out there, and it is appropriately labeled as such. Hillary writes fiction and fails to tell you that's what you're reading, but make no mistake -- what she isn't lying about, she casting in a light that only someone with as deceptive a mind as she could pull off. (I read excerpts of this on a lunch hour one day because I absolutely refuse to give Mrs. Clinton even a dime of my money. I left the book in the store, which is where I wish the American public would leave it, as well.)"
1,Revisionist History,This is a book about the way Hiliary would like us to see what happened-- one would have to be a complete idiot to believe a word!
1,There should be a no star rating for literary ...,"Its bad enough that this country had to endure the Clinton regime,their controversial lives, and all the questionable activities of two of the world's most notorios liars, but now the former First Lady is trying to profit from a ridiculous book in an effort to whitewash their administration. As if any intelligent person would even be remotely interested in her political views! When are people going to stop rewarding politicians for their less than honorable acitivities? If you want to be patriotic, do not buy this book...Hilary and Bill should stop writing books and perhaps try reading a few...especially the Greatest Story Ever Told."
1,living history,"Fact or fiction ? Although this book is supposed to be factual, it's difficult to believe because of the author's image."
1,Living History,"Ms. Clinton's book is awful. The only thing good in the piece is her word choice. I do not recommend it to anyone, even those who are fans of Ms. Clinton."
4,"Warm and engaging, taken at face value","One reviewer described the Monica Lewinsky section of this book as ""calculating (to win the reader's sympathy)"". Their venom for Hillary Clinton was almost tangible. If you're predisposed to hate Hillary Clinton, this is the wrong book for you to spend time with - I do not recommend it. You'll grit your teeth and find every word disingenuous and self-serving.If, however, you're predisposed to like Mrs. Clinton, or are neutral and are willing to take the narrative at face value, you'll be rewarded by an engaging portrait of a strong, highly intelligent woman whose central priorities are the rights of women and children.I listened to this book on abridged audio, narrated by Mrs. Clinton. (Regretfully, only the abridged version was available from my local library.) Mrs. Clinton is an enthusiastic, engaging reader, who does an admirable job with her own material."
4,Typical Autobiography,"Not everyone is David McCullough.....Her writing style is like she is somewhat formal, intent,and human (keep your day job Hillary). The early years were boring, like a laundry list.When her and her husband enter the White House years the storybecomes fascinating. Remember this is supposed to be a recountthrough HER eyes. What I loved the most was the stories aboutall the people who showed her kindness during her most troubledtimes. What wonderful and special people on a personal levelare Nelson Mandela, Jackie Kennedy, Walter Cronkite, Stevie Wonder and all of her closest friends from the old days.I especially loved what Jackie told Hillary about raising herdaughter in the spotlight.Hillary is as I expected a human being who wants to do the right thing."
5,Living History,"Excellent! You will learn many things when you read this book! Thanks!reasonable price, fast deliver, very good condition, I love this book, I read it every night. good one!"
1,I Like Hillary-- But Not Her Book.,"I've got nothing against Hillary Clinton. I voted for her for Senate, and I'd certainly vote for her if she were to become the Democratic candidate for President against George W. Bush. But this is just not a good book. It reads like a children's book, except with the word ""Republicans"" substituted for ""scary monsters."" She makes everything sound so simple and one-sided, with the Democrats always on the side of right, and the Republicans always on the side of greed or pettiness or evil. But I certainly remember that at the time a real debate was happening, even if the Democrats might have had the better of the argument. The book is boring, uninsightful, unrevealing, and totally self-serving. Whether you like Hillary Clinton or not, this is just not a good book to read."
1,Can I do half a star?,"I was up all night with this book. Here's what I learned: nothing. What I knew, I know some more. What I didn't know, I found hard to believe. Everything comes across as calculated, one eye on the polls. Even the fictitious account of Bill breaking the news to her about Monica is an obvious ploy to capture the hearts of both women and men who she'd like to see her as more sympathetic. (If she really didn't know, she was the only person in America who didn't, which makes her a lousy candidate for leader of the free world, and if she did know, that makes her a liar. But hey, Bill's defenders always said, ""Hey, everybody lies,"" so I guess it's no slur.)I bought it as a gift for a friend. I hope he'll still be speaking to me a week from now when he's done."
1,ugh.,"thank heavens I read a friend's copy. Pure spin, few real insights into the author's mind or heart, from the woman who hopes to be the first female President. Save your money."
1,Just plain boring and bad,"The book was a bad read, boring, and not very interesting. A waste of my money and the publishers."
1,When will we ever learn?,"Sadness. Hillary Rodham Clinton has become a heroine of epic proportions to ... who? Long lines of people wait to have her signature on their copy of a book that reveals nothing of whom they think she is. What has she done to deserve their adulation? She was the wife a president. She remained with him after he committed a series of adulteries. She admits struggling with staying, a normal reaction. But what sets her apart, shows her to be above the norm? Where are the stories of true bravery, the life of one dedicated to changing the world to be so much better? And what has she really done to make the world better? The answer is not in this book. Why not? Perhaps the answer is because she hasn't done anything to change the world for the the better. So why bother to read the book? It won't make you any better either."
1,"Fine, if classified as fiction/fantasy",I can't imagine anyone still sitting the fence on the issue of this person's honesty and motivation. Those who love her (probably the decendants of those who loved Al Capone) will buy one or more copies for the effective voting factor. Everyone knows that ghost writers filled the pages with a typical Clintonian self-righteous diatribe in time to meet her deadline.
2,LIVING DELUSION,"I gave this book 2 stars, because it's a book. All books have some merit, good or bad. This is a hard book to comment on. The author is not really an author, so the writing is flat and incoherent. It also is, frankly, irrelevent. The point of the book is questionable. Is the writer trying to include us in a world that we aren't involved in and situations that we aren't privy to? Is the writer writing this as a vehicle for poilital persuaion and advancement? I don't know. No one really knows. The main failing of the book is the delusion of the writer, as the real living history has proven. This is how the writer sees situations as they exist. As they exist to her. I really think the book is a waste of time, because of the reputation of the writer. You really don't know what you're reading. Too much manipulation in the past gives the writer no credibility."
4,The World from the First Lady's Perspective,"Just finsihed reading Living History and I enjoyed the book because it gave me an insight into Hillary and her life. I had no idea that she was raised a Republican and was a Goldwater Girl in college. Her travels around the world on behalf of women's rights are perhaps, the most interesting part of the book for me. For eight years she spoke in front of groups on all the continents from China to India to Africa and everywhere in between. I don't think a First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt has been such an ambassador, especially in countries where women are treated as second class citizens. It's a good read."
1,Very disappointed.,"Not as described, worthless depressing ridiculous book.I hope I could get my money back."
5,A Young Person Inspired!!!,"As I came to the last chapter entitled ""New York,"" I was filled with excitement for I felt as though I had come on the long journey of ""living history"" with Hillary Clinton. From her graduation speech at Wellesley to traveling to Africa to enduring the pain of politics to ""soldiering on"" and coming out on top as Senator Clinton of New York, her book was able to capture the heart this reader. I loved every moment and it provided great entertainment and inspiration over the last couple of weeks. As a young person, I would recommend this book to any female who is looking to one day go into politics. Mrs. Clinton shares a great deal of wisdom that she has received from women all over the world and through her own experiences and trials. I've learned many lessons over time and as I prepare to choose my life's work, reading Hillary Clinton's book was very inspiring! If you are looking to know the true Hillary Clinton, then read this book!!"
1,Extremely Dull & Self-Serving,"Maybe she should have tried writing this book herself or hired some writers who could give some life to this extremely dull read. I understand that when you're in office you can't afford to offend anyone, but please give us something interesting. There is nothing at all new in this book that hasn't been written about before. Save your money or buy it in a couple of weeks when it's on sale."
1,Hillary settting the example for us all,"If you like to be preached to, this is the book for you.If you want to hear more lies, this is the book for you.If you want to hear how you can't live without Hillary this is the book for you.Take a look at Hillary on camera, and take a look at Hillary on this cover. You'll see a serious difference. The airbrushing that occured on the cover is a metaphor for the whitewashing that occurs in side. You'll laugh and you'll cry at the chutzpah of a woman who can charge for telling these lies."
4,Love her or hate her,"Love her or hate herReviewer: starrdavid from Edison, nj USALove Hillary or hate her, it's inconsequential. The CD Audio-book is captivating, elucidating and honest. She, like Madeline Albright, takes a view of the events surrounding them and those in which they are involved and offer their personal take on the situations. While Mrs. Clinton's ""Living History"" is a superb memoir, Secretary of State Madeline Albright's ""Madam Secretary"" is the more captivating and informative and self-revealing of the two powerful, brilliant women. Both are excellent reads."
4,Interesting read,"Not being American, my thoughts were not as tied to partisan politics as some readers here seem to be (although from the tone of some reviews, I doubt that the reviewers have even read the book). I found this book to be a unique insight to one side of a story that has played out on the international stage for some time now. At times, Ms. Clinton's writing does read like a speech but the book certainly does need to be read from the understanding that is written by someone still in office. I found her level of personal disclosure on the Monica affair to be surprising but perhaps that was a requirement of her contract. Hillary Clinton is a unique first lady in that she had a succesful career and made more than her husband most of her life. I can't imagine trying fit into the tiny little box that the press tries to place first ladies in. He book did a credible job at describing the life she chose for herself, instead."
1,Pulp Fiction,A poor attempt at rewriting history. Perhaps the book was written for an audience of minority voters with minimum education.This is an example of target marketing gone bad.Very insulting and condesending.
1,LIVING HISTORY BY HILLARY CLINTON,"Why can't we just get the truth? This book seems more like a fiction to me. Garbage in, garbage out! Met my expectations."
1,Softsoap nonsense,"This weighty tome offers (often inconsistent) answers to the kind of softball questions that Larry King or Katie Couric like to offer up. Mrs. Rodham-Clinton says that she doesn't want to be in the kitchen baking cookies. It is clear that she has no intention of writing serious books, either. Save your money and your time. Avoid."
1,Living History? More like History of the World Part 2,"This book was an attempt to make Hillary look like the typical ""taken advantage of"" housewife. The question is, will America be illiterate enough to take this work of ""fiction"" and believe it to be true.I applaud Mrs. Clintons grasp for money at any cost. Only in America."
1,History to Spin,"The book started out well giving background from the past, etc.But as the book moved forward, it seemed to leave the good natured story type of book and started to elude or try to deflect on several things. It did that more and more as I progressed through the book. If it would have continued in the same way that it began seemingly honest and forthright I would have given it more stars, but I feel that I just paid $ for a book of ""spin"". I always like to be fair and give a person or their book a chance. But that is hard when you can even detect a change in the books rehortic. Did James Carvel have anything to do with this book?I will give it one star for trying. Writing a book is hard, but I don't think that hard."
1,Tissue of Lies,"That Hillary Clinton is not capable of telling the truth comes as no surprise to me - neither does it disturb me. After ten years of this seedy bunch, we all know what they are made of.It also comes as no surprise that some people in America believe this crap, and that they actually *support* this woman. it does, however, disturb me, because the Truth is out there for everyone to see.I have only four words for anyone who falls for this pack of lies:You Are A Fool."
1,Re hashing history,There is nothing new here. Except for the obvious attempt to put a few issues behind her in preperation for the next campaign this book is little more than a rehash of things that have been printed or reported time and again.Wait for the paper back.
1,Mere rhetoric for a self-serving propaganda artist,"I finished reading Hillary's ""Living History"" this week and was surprised to discover just how paranoid and extreme the former first lady really is. From the Whitewater scandal to winning the senate seat in the White House, this 570 plus page book fails to reveal to the reader just how evil this witch can be."
1,This isnt Hillary Clinton...,speaking the truth. Hillary is back to the Clinton way of twisting information to fit whatever she needs. The events listed in the book have been chronicled in other books and with investigators. why does Hillarys accounts differ from everyone elses? I just cant recommend this book to anyone. I used to be a hillary fan. I am tired of all of the lies.
3,Bill's book is better,"I regret buying this book which is generally an especially damning assessment of any book, or product for that matter.It's not that the book was especially bad, it wasn't. It was rather intersting at moments. There's just something about Hilary that it is just difficult to really connect with her.The book was interesting and it offers a unique insight into a woman's life growing up through a difficult time of social upheaval in American history. If you're a big Hilary fan you'd probably enjoy this book, probably... However, for anyone else I don't recommend it. There's just nothing compelling about the way it is written; though some of the content is interesting."
2,Where's the Candor?,"I didn't expect much from this book, but I still expected much more than I got. I'm a New Yorker who voted for Senator Clinton because I agreed with her politics. I have always been of the opinion that her husband is a heroic adulterer, but that this part of his life was not a reason to vote against - let alone impeach - him. (If we got rid of adulterous politicians, the Capitol building would be mostly empty of them.)I bought the book based on news reports that, in it, Senator Clinted was ""remarkably candid,"" but, instead, she plays it safe, pulls her punches, and presents a view of her marriage that is not very believable. I believe that Senator Clinton is a highly intelligent woman, and no highly intelligent woman could believe that the former President has been a mostly faithful husband, who briefly strayed with Ms. Lewinsky.It all makes for a dull read. I guess we'll have to wait for her to be out of politics and divorced before we get some real candor out of her."
1,"This is a comedy,,,,right????","The book is laughable! Actually fun to read if you like fiction. This is one scary lady. ... Does she really think that we believe what she wrote,,,,if she wrote it at all. Oh Mrs. C,,,,,,you are one scary women. ..."
2,Nothing worth reading,"I just finished the book after spending a good part of my afternoon reading it. I picked it up this morning expecting something phenomenal, with the [amount of money paid] up front, and all the appearances, the interviews, and media hype. My recommendation? Don't even bother. The memoirs are really nothing special and all the juicy parts have already been all over the press. All the rest is just a bland recap of the life of someone who is pretty much uninteresting. Not the worst she could do, but nothing near what should be expected from a popular senator and possible future presidential hopeful."
3,"Not terrible, but you better be a big fan of Hillary.","There is very little here that a true-blue Hillary-fan does not already know about her, or any relevations about her political philosophy that any savvy person has not already surmised. I suspect that Ms. Clinton did not produce this book as a means of increasing her political base, but rather as a means of increasing her bank account. You might have heard that this book was written by a committee of ghostwriters in just a few weeks; sadly, it often feels like it. I would suggest that if you want a taste of the real Hillary, you should read IT TAKES A VILLAGE, which, I believe, was actually written by her."
5,Judge not lest ye be judged,"I read the book and I thought that it was a good read. I have been reading other peoples remarks on this book and I have one thing to ask.....How would you know what goes on behind closed doors??? Unless your name is Bill, Hillary or Chelsea you wouldn't. It is not for me, you or anyone else to judge this man or his family for what happened behind closed doors. NEWS FLASH people....Bill Clinton is not the only president to have an extra marital affair. Yes, he lied. BUT given the situation I would put money on the fact that ANY of you would too. Not one of us is any better than the other. Appreciate the fact that this man was the best president that this country has had since JFK. If you want to judge Bill Clinton then judge him for the job that he did as president NOT for what he did in the bedroom."
2,So then why did she hire a private eye?,"OK. She knew nothing about Bill's womanizing. If that is true then why did she hire Maggie Williams to remove him from off limits bedrooms? And why did she hire Paladino, the detective to watch the President?This from the woman who used Tyson Chicken's commodity Broker to help her make $100,000 in Cattle, getting her broker statements done by typewriter, rather than computer. She quit when the amount of the bribe was filled. Anybody else that smart would have kept on trading."
2,A self-serving view of history,"I have admired Ms. Clinton for her stand on womens' rights issues. However, this book was not only self-serving, it was boring. She chronicled in minute detail every trip she took, how people loved her, ad nauseum! She comes across as being so impressed with herself as a wife (her adoration of Bill was disgusting), a mother (Chelsea must be the most fantastic child ever to be born!) and a politician. Everything she had to say that would be of interest could have been covered in 50 pages.Dull, dull, dull."
2,"If you like to read those boring life story books, this is for you......if not, don't waste you time or money","This book was a big disapointment to me. It included stories about her parents, grandparents, and of course herself. The first few chapters describes her parents life, then gradually goes on to talking about her years as a youth and how much experience she has had over the years of her life blah blah blah. The book then goes on to say how she met Bill and what she did to in the White House. But, the chapter that impressed me the most in the midst of a dull book, was in fact the chapter about health care. But, as I said earlier, this was a boring book meant for people who just want striaght forward facts with no excitement. It is actually so boring that I had trouble finishing it."
4,Good Historical Account,"In politics and in life everyone has an angle. Hillary certainly had an angle in writing this book and i will not over specualate on her intentions for writing this book. However, i did enjoy the explanation of the behind the scene policy debates of the Clinton presidency. It was actually more objective than i expected. After reading this and a couple of books on President Clinton i have come to the conclusion that Bill and Hillary Clinton are a lot more moderate than their Republican enemies have labeled them to be. This is a good book and i recommend it. For a good book on President Clinton i recommend ""First in His Class"" by Bob Maraniss."
2,A book of name dropping,"Seriously, this book was a huge disappointment.It seemed like, page after page, all there was was a lot of name dropping which made for a boring read and difficult to follow in parts.Normally, in a personal memoir such as this, the author will ""open up"" and let the reader in but Hillary remains guarded throughout.I am a fan of Hillary in many ways but this book is not one of them."
3,Not a bad book ...,"Whatever one thinks of the politics of Mrs. Clinton, surely they would agree that she's lived an interesting life, worthy of a bio. Revisionist history? Yes, probably to some extent, but aren't all autobiographies?The first half provided some new insights and was very interesting; the second half just seemed to restate facts. All in all, still an enjoyable listen. I heard the unabridged Audible version, read by the author."
1,Any thinking American Should and will be Insulted,"Just suffered through this piece of fiction. Incredible obfuscation. Could Hillary be any more evasive? From what I recall of history, Hillary&#65533;s account is full of half-truths, convenient selective memory, and historical revisionism. Any thinking American should and will be insulted."
2,Whitewashing History,"I wanted to like this book--I really did. I was so hoping for inside information or just explanations of why, when, and how events came down. But I came away feeling as if someone (and maybe it was the ghostwriter's fault) was just trying to brush away all the bad things. Her explanation of how she reacted to her husband's affair with Monica was just ludicruous. Hillary is known to have strong opinions, a quick temper, and a woman capable of dealing with anything life tosses her. Her explanation fell flat, flat, flat with me.If she ever chooses to rewrite the memoirs of the second half of her life, I hope she shows the real inside emotions--not something that just looks good on paper."
1,Give me a break!,"I made an honest effort at reading this thing. I was really hoping to get some insight at what makes a person like this successful. If she really believes the things that she has said or says enough to gain the misguided trust of the left and launch herself into power. I was disappointed on all fronts.Nothing new, more of the same, and typical ... Clinton attempt at the truth. Anyone who reads this with a knowledge of the events as they unfolded or an intuition of self-righteous writing will see that in a second. The only thing that can be gained here is more people seeing through this woman in her own words and her dishonesty. Hopefully this book will end her political career before it goes any further.I never really considered myself on the left, but after reading this, perhaps I have been on the wrong side of politics if this person is the ""up and coming star"" of the Democratic party.Save your money"
2,"Ghost written, by BORING ghosts","This book is for die-hard Hillary fans only! It is not personable, its not interesting, its not charming, or warm. It is written like a history text book, not a memoir. This book is 500 pages of political spin doctoring, nothing more. I read...zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...after falling asleep often..zzzzzzzzzz...the whole thing, or at least I slept through the whole thing - and I still feel like I know NOTHING about Hillary or Bill. This book was written to launch Hillary's run for President. If you feel that you must try this book yourself, PLEASE don't waste your money like I did...borrow a copy; it will be the best [$$$] you ever saved."
1,Only One Star?,"Yes....because ""0"" wasn't a rating option. I borrowed the book because I could never bring myself to pay for it. I'm almost ashamed to have read the book. I guess I am one of the useful idiots after all. Should be in the fiction section of the brick and mortar stores."
1,500 + pages of utter dreck,"This book is a farce in so many ways it would take as many ghost writers as Hillary used to delineate them all. She wrote essentially none of this book, yet has the temerity to put her name down as the sole author - that in a nutshell tells you everything you need to know about this woman.The book, besides being false on so many levels, has the sin of being incredibly boring - paint drying, grass growing, boring.If you read the out takes in Time or saw the softball Baba Wawa interview save yourself the time and trouble and get a good book for summer reading. Cause this ain't it."
2,Not what we were looking for.,The book sounds interesting but you can tell the four co-authors did much of the writing which made me wonder how much of the book was in Hillary's own thoughts and words. It plays like a victim over and over and it would be better as a conversation piece than a pity party. If she writes another book lets hope it isnt for political capitalization for women only.
2,Not Very Good,"Unlike her husband, Hillary Rodham Clinton has not demonstrated any talent for writing. Her ""Living History"" is really a sad demonstration of her skill or lack of it as an author. If you want to read some well written words try ""My Life"" by Bill Clinton."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on...,"As an independent voter who has voted for Republicans and Dems alike, I generally have held a favorable view of former Pres. Bill Clinton. However, I've never really trusted Hillary, and have generally found her to be transparent, unconvincing, and quite opportunistic. I hoped that this book would shed some light, and perhaps change my opinion of the woman. It didn't. In fact, it has changed my view from one of distrust to all out dislike.There is a chance that she may one day become president, or vice pres. for that matter, but it will not be with the help of my vote."
1,Wasted My Time,"I was very disappointed in this book after all the hoop-la that was made over it in the news. Very boring, unrealistic."
1,What a waste,"This book was such a joke, but what could you expect from a money and power hungry, lying, fake. Hillary could not tell the truth if her life depended on it. I'm so sick of hearing her held up as a role model for our young women. Where was N.O.W. when she was so grief stricken by her husband's infidelity(s). This book was a waste of good money, (I didn't buy it, it was given to me) and time spent reading it. Gee wonder how many copies her and Bill bought?"
2,Sadly lacking,"It would have been nice if she could finally have told the truth, and had presented herself as it is. Apparently, that is never going to happen."
1,Feel sorry for America:,"If this women, whose only purpose in life is power, could sell this book (written, of course, by other people) full of lies to many people, I feel really sorry for our country. It was founded with respect to reason and individual rights, look were we are now... Her political platform is collectivism (socialist kind), she is against American right to defend itself (without consulting with other countries), she is agains business, achievement, she is against individual rights, she is racist - she believes, one's views are determined by a race.People - open your reason - what are you buying ?!"
3,wise woman who chose the right husband,Gee she is a saint if you believe everything she wrote (if she did).I don't have any personal feelings against her. As a woman I consider her a very successful case. After all not many women or men for that matter could achieve what she's done today. No matter you admit or not. No matter you like her or hate her. But I simply have trouble believing that Republicans are all against her and Clinton Adminitration regardless the interest of the nation. Her writing style isn't very appealing. And it appears so clearly that she focused on the White House years (which was the highlight of her life after all) and she seemed very self-obsorbed as if it was her running the President Office. Therefore I developed the feeling that she was paving the way to a presidential election some time soon. it would be a legend if she entered one. But who could predict? Americans love legends.
3,Interesting at the least.,"Interesting reading to say the least. Obviously she considered the Presidency a dual position which she graciously shared with her husband. She is obviously very smart and will be the first to tell you so. The book is also interesting as to what has been left out. Although she apparently doesn't consider it so, her term as first lady of Arkansas was a turbulent one, however she skims over that Her disgust with her husband over the Monica incident stems, it seems, not so much over the fact that he had violated his vows to her, but that he had seemingly ruined the partnership they had as co-presidents. No wonder she gulped for air. She also seems to breeze through the Impeachment too quickly. No doubt this is but a forerunner to her announcing her own intention to ""continue"" her Presidency. I would still vote for her however over what the Republicans have to offer us."
4,Get to know Hil a little,"Why do so many people loath this woman so much?! She comes across as being very intelligent, has a sense of humor and seems to actually care about our nation. I confess, I only bought a copy of this book to see what would happen when Tucker Carlson had to watch it reach the 1 million mark. But I picked it up because Hillary's response to him on Crossfire was so gracious when it actually happened.The book has some boring parts and is occassionally over explanitory, but it also has some parts that are very interesting. Did you know Hillary used to be a - Republican? If not it is worth a read."
4,Things that needed to be said -,"I enjoyed this book. I felt it was well-written and that it gave us a view that the press did not give us to many of the events during the Clinton presidency...It was a marvelous book.Dolores May, An American CitizenServing in Italy for the Allied Forces."
2,Is this book for real?,"Can you really believe what is written in a book that claims, on the first page,'that the United States saved the world from fascism'. Makes me wonder what Britain, Europe and the Commonwealth were doing between the years 1939 and 1945 !!!!!!!!!!"
4,Fascinating read,The rise of the Clintons and the magnitude of their problems are fascinating. Hillarys attempt to always be a victim is hillarious. Very creative. Her shallowness shines through and through. Sadly her few followers are the same. As she slowly fades into her twilight years this is a fitting tribute to her life. Fascinating but meaningless.
4,Read the book,"I swear that all these people getting on amazon and bashing the living daylights out of Senator Clinton is probably the most disgusting thing I've seen this week, next to the fact that it backs up her right-wing conspiracy theory moreso than any book may. I voted for her. I knew most of this already, and was little disappointed by the lack of candor, but as a whole, it's a worthwhile read. If you are a conservative and don't feel that woman should be allowed into politics and like Laura Bush better in that she hasn't taken a stand on anything and like her husband who lies to the American people daily but believe his nonsense then don't bother reading this book, plain and simple."
1,What were you thinking???,"I didn't think that any book could be worse than My Life: Bill Clinton, but this book takes the cake. WOOOOOO!!! This book sucks!! I mean, Living History, LIVING HISTORY, honestly Hillery, you are living history, no one is going to vote for you in 08. Congratulations Hillery, you've written the only book in existence worse than your husband's!"
1,"Thank Godness, She's Gone",This book said nothing and provided no new insight the Clinton politcal machine. It does reenforce the fact that I'm glad she is no longer manipulate the presidency of the US. I only pray (and I do pray daily) that she will never pursue higher office again.
4,A walk in History,"This book recounts the years of the Clinton presidency, from a historic view point. The drama of these years is discussed, but the impact of the trips to foreign nations and the difficulty of raising a family take center stage. Yes, we get the writer's political views, but the interest is in the peoples and place traveled. She shares with us what she learned on all thosetrips paid for with our tax payer dollars. If you can set aside your preconceived politacal beliefs, there is allot to be learned about our world in these pages."
3,"Light reading, don't expect much depth",It's good if you're not expecting too much--it does a decent job of talking about what it's like to be First Lady but doesn't have much in the way of political substance.
3,Wait until she is done in Washington,"If you are expecting a politician to candidly put his/her ideas in a book, you should wait until that person is no longer in politics.Senator Clinton plays it very safe and because of her partial candor, the book falls short of an engaging biography."
3,Selecting a Hillary Review,"I couldn't put down the book for the first 100 pages, and did so only to take my mom in for hip replacement surgery. I read Mom highlights from the second hundred pages before she took the post-op darvocets. She loved it, too.Then I noticed some reviews. What the heck were they reading?Number one rule on selecting reviews: When the reviewer loads the start of her review with meta-review gossip, hype or personal angst, pitch the darn thing; just read about content.So, my real review will come when I finish the book. This note is a simple heads-up to self-serving, fluffy, side-tracked reviews. Read the book! Gotta go to the hospital...."
5,A Fascinating Read about a Fascinating Woman,"What I took from Living History was that Hillary Clinton is a normal, though extraordinary person. That may seem like a contradiction, but you see in this book how she is both brilliant -- her analysis of issues and situations large and small displays a keen intelligence -- yet human. Througout the book, the voice comes through of a person who loves her family and friends, who is proud of her daughter, and feels her faith tremndously. I found it a fascinating read and highly recommend it.Forget the hype -- and read Hillary's story in her own words."
4,These reviews are being Freeped,"In case no one has figured it out, this review page is being freeped. If you don't know what that means, it means the denizens of Free Republic.com, who admit on their site they ""wouldn't read this book if it was the only book in the world"" are writing bad reviews in hopes of cutting into sales.Bought a copy today - it gives the Clinton side of the White House years. Is that one sided? WELL DUH - I suppose Newts' little gems are supposed to be all even handed or something? Or maybe I could turn to Grover Norquist for an even handed look at the Clinton years?From what I've skimmed, it is an inside look at the Clinton White House from the Clinton viewpoint. If that's what you want, then buy it. If not, don't.Getting into a snit because the book is selling is simply unAmerican."
1,"Hi, i hang out at freeprepublic.com","im outraged that juanita broderick wusn't even menshunned in this book! and-and-and, and Hillary is a lair! jus like all the libural/DEMONcRAT/socialist/commiescum are!(Actually, I haven't even read this book, i don't read much cuz that's only fun to mentals, but i am pretending that i did, so i can express my obsessive, irrational hatred of the Clintons just like all the other slobbering primates at freep republic... monkey see, monkey spew!)"
5,Wonderful Book for a Wonderful Woman,"Many other viewers have ravaged Hillary's marvelous new book as a travesty. While such books of Ann Coultor's (obviously one reviewer can't even remember the name of ridiculous and silly conservative authors) make a mockery of the profession known as being a novelist and journalist.This book is nothing more than a look into the life of one of America's most well known women, not to mention one of the most influential.I can't help but ask why are the conservatives in such an uproar over something as simple as a memoir? Perhaps it's that Hillary may shed light on the dirty politics of Republicans? But that is not so. This book helps us understand the thinking of one of the best First Lady's this country has ever seen.Read the book and decide for yourself. Don't let obviously jealous and ""follow the leader even if they jump off a cliff"" conservatives make your opinions for you. The book is a great read and I highly recommend it."
1,Living History,Reads like a DNC Press Release. I wanted to see anything candid about President Clinton's White House. This was not that book! A waste of money.
1,The joke of the new milenium!,"Hillary's book was written by three ghost writers. Hillary just added to the content a little. Her book is basically a lie and she was living in a dream world as evidenced by her book. Bluementhal's book discredits a lot of her stories. Bill Clinton said Bluementhal's book was 100% correct. If his book is accurate, Hillary's is a lie. Hillary's book needs to be in the fiction section of the store. An absolute waste of money."
2,Natural sleeping pill alternative,Hillary Clinton is an amazing woman yet this book is boring and offers no more insight into her life than the average reader has already gleamed from mass media during the Clinton years. I'd read a few pages every night then fall fast asleep.
5,Good enough to make Tucker eat his tie,"The conservatives are deathly afraid of Hillary. They know that she is the woman most likely to become the first female president. Her book, combined with David Brock's ""Blinded by the Right,"" paint an accurate portrait of the vast right-wing conspiracy that they simply don't want you to believe. A minority junta has taken control of the media, including the editorial section of sites like this, to present their biased, far-right views as though they were held by everyone. Don't listen to the Freeper hype from these timid conservatives, challenge yourself, read the insider account, and learn the truth about the campaign to destory the Clintons that cost us all 70 million and the world's respect."
1,Lying as an artform,Perhaps the greatest legacy of the Clintons will be their inability to discern truth from falsehood and their pathology in believing that the means justifies the ends. This diatribe in nothing but an attempt to whitewash the 8 years of corruption of the Clinton administration. Never has evil been wrapped in such a beautiful package.
1,"Dying ""History""","I really wonder if Hillary would recognize a truth, even a simple one. My 1st recollection of her is when she was sitting next to her husband while he lied on national TV during the '92 primaries. She just sat there and nodded agreement as her husband told lie after lie to the viewing public.You keep doing that year after year and soon you can't recognize what is true and what it is that you would like to be true.That's why I can't believe her when she describes her emotions when she hears the obvious truth from Bill's own mouth. She is really describing what she thinks ordinary people would feel if they were betrayed by their spouse. She was already long past feeling anything when she was confronted by another betrayal and another big lie.She is to be pitied."
2,Okay...What Did I Expect????,"Let me make this quick:1) Hillary is an interesting, accomplished woman in her own right (read the pre-Bill stuff);2) She knows and we know that she wasn't ""shocked and gasping for air"" when she found out about Monica. She was probably really mad! However, she knows and we know that only a suicidal politician would admit otherwise. (What was she supposed to say, anyway?)3) She should have waited until after her two terms as president were finished before writing this book. Then, she could have written it honestly and it probably would have won a Pulitzer Prize!For those who have not yet bought the book: Don't bother, unless you are really and truly interested in learning about the pre-Bill Hillary (which is impressive)."
3,Not as good as it should have been...,"This book is a valuable read for one reason: it sheds SOME light on Hillary's background and the issues about which she truly cares. Were the book tailored to that purpose exclusively, it would be an excellent work. But Senator Clinton repeatedly attempts to sneak references to the many controversies surrounding her time in the White House, opening the door to these topics but approaching them only on the surface.In short, if Hillary wanted to write a tell-all, she should have. If she wanted to produce an in-depth treatment of her political convictions and priorities, she should have. By attempting to combine elements of both, she does neither well. The result is a book that starts quickly, drags tediously through the middle, and then picks up steam once again at the end. But the perspective is unique and justifies the time spent to labor through Living History."
2,Where's the Candor?,"I didn't expect much from this book, but I still expected much more than I got. I'm a New Yorker who voted for Senator Clinton because I agreed with her politics. I have always been of the opinion that her husband is a heroic adulterer, but that this part of his life was not a reason to vote against - let alone impeach - him. (If we got rid of adulterous politicians, the Capitol building would be mostly empty of them.)I bought the book based on news reports that, in it, Senator Clinton was ""remarkably candid,"" but, instead, she plays it safe, pulls her punches, and presents a view of her marriage that is not very believable. I believe that Senator Clinton is a highly intelligent woman, and no highly intelligent woman could believe that the former President has been a mostly faithful husband, who briefly strayed with Ms. Lewinsky.It all makes for a dull read. I guess we'll have to wait for her to be out of politics and divorced before we get some real candor out of her."
1,This book is an insult to the American public,"Rehash, old news, shameful political promotion, and lies that attempt to make the ""author"" appear a victim and the human answer to all social ills. Where are the true facts? It was a gift, read most and put it in the trash. Save your money!"
1,Should be in the fiction section,"This was an awful book. I used to have a moderate amount of respect for the woman, but this book is horrible. For a woman that could be so powerful and influential, this is just an awful example for herself and women in general. So, in short, I don't recommend wasting the money."
1,Improbable History,"I was very disappointed. This book appears to be little more the latest Clinton cover-up. As usual, this is yet another hazy story full of improbable cirumstances and questionable timelines, so transparent that only the most ardent Clinton fanatic could not see through it.I read it hoping to get a picture of who Hillary Clinton really is behind the plastic facade, but I discovered just another contrived persona that has been carefully constructed for public consumption. No wonder it's not the real Hillary, considering as it turns out, that she didn't actually write the book.Instead, it would appear that Hillary Clinton is just the spokesperson for a name brand product in the latest era of celebrity marketing."
1,Not worth the money,This book definitely belongs in Fiction...Poorly written and far less than honest...There is nothing new to learn from this account.
1,Living Fantasy,"Many of us lived throught the ""history"" hillary purports to cover in her book. She seems to write about events that she could not recall a few years ago. Not worth the time or the money..."
2,shattered expectations,"I can't profess to be a Hillary hater, but not truly a fan. However I have always been intrigued by the unique role she played in American political history. That said, I think this book is a disappointment. It resembles a college term paper written the night before the due date and it is very apparent as Hillary acknowledges in the opening, that more than one person was ghost writing with her.Hillary offers nothing new, or valuable to the historical discussion and frankly, some of the things she passes off as her feelings seem pretty hard to believe.She obviously made out with an $8 million dollar advance and it seems that sales will bring profits for the publisher, so its no wonder that the reader is stuck with the bill for a less than interesting book."
1,Not worth a single star or penny,"Being a professional writer, it is my opinion that this book is not worth a single penny. Its 560 pages are filled with tripe, insults, out-right lies, and delusional fiction. Furthermore, it contradicts not only various news accounts, but Sid Blumenthal's book on many points. (By the way, Bill Clinton has publicly come-out and indorsed Blumenthal's book as being the truth!) All-in-all, this is nothing more than Hillary Clinton trying to appeal to women as a victim for her presidential run in 2008. Bottom Line: It is total garbage!"
1,A Boring Rehash of History,"I feel that the book just rehashes most of everything we all ready know, and that the book is an attempt to portray Ms. Clinton in a favorable light on all events in the past. It really does not speak much to the future in any way that would cast a shadow over her ambitions."
1,"Lies, BS and PC Pablum",If your looking for a truthful insight on the Cliton years then buy a different book. If you are self delusional by nature and nostalgic for the Clinton years then order today.
1,Living History?,"It takes alot of balls to for Hilary to call her book""Living History"". What history? Sex in the White House,renting the Lincoln Bedroom out, those notorious coffees,and scandal after scandal? If your idea of history is whatgoes on on any cheap soap opera then I guess she did livehistory. This book is nothing more than a way for Hilaryto keep her name out there for a possible 2008 presidentialrun and to make a few bucks. It used to be that liberalsstood for something. They now do what they are told andthink the party line. A party line written by the likesof Hilary. I used to like Hilary so much, thought she waspretty and smart. Not any more. Buy the book for amusement,I might, but don't take any of it seriously."
3,A Conservative Woman's View,"Hillary, like so many others who write about themselves, has written a book that doesn't live up to the hype. Her writing styly is very interesting; and especially as a conservative, you want to read every page. The book is too long. Her bias is so incredibly displayed in this book; but, then I certainly expected that. She shows her intellectual abilities well in this biography. She and President Clinton are so different. She shows that she is not the outgoing, persuasive, salesmanlike, charming personality that her husband is. She, however, appears to me more intelligent than does he. This probably explains why they are a team. She does the detail thinking and the work; and he sells it. You can't beat that for making a great team. However, it leaves her lacking in a run for the presidency. Charm is needed that she doesn't possess. This book is really more for conservatives like me than for liberals, who seem to love her no matter what. Read it if you like politics."
2,Never laughed so hard in my life!,"It's frightening that anyone takes this woman seriously. That said, this book had me cracking up at every page. Whatever you think of Hillary Clinton, you have to admire her brass, so I gave it a higher rating than I usually give ghostwritten fiction."
1,Y.A.W.N.,"I wanted to like this book. I *really* wanted to. And I tried. I struggled through the first 75 pages, and then even skipped ahead to the Monica stuff (page 439) in a desperate effort to find something readable. Nope.Okay, this isn't a spy novel or my precious Star Trek, but I expected at least *some* daring writing. Not a word. In fact, the only three bright spots I noticed were: 1) The photos, 2) A few pages describing getting Chelsea to Stanford (pages 419-421), and 3) Five paragraphs on page 438 about the ""swimsuit photo."" Beyond that, I wouldn't know, because that's about all I read.The Acknowledgements are 6 pages long, and the Index is 28 pages! I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but I'm pretty sure ""deadly"" wasn't it. Sorry, Hillary."
5,REVEALING,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Reveals what goes on behind the scenes in Washington. Reaffirms that Congress is not about the constituents, but about democrats vs. republicans no matter who is in power. So interesting."
4,"Lots of Al Gore, very little Gory gossip","I can't tell you why I bought this book 3 years ago. In fact I didn't even remember I had it until its dust gathering spine peeked at me about a week ago. Due to my gathering interest in the US presidential primaries (I'm Australian) I thought - why not. What I found was a compelling read. I must admit I was even a little teary at times. Yes, it's unashamedly one sided (what with the many references to Republican plots!), no it doesn't go into anywhere near the type of vicarious gory detail I wanted about the Monika and why she stayed with Bill (but c'mon it's a serious book not tmz.com!) and yes, I quite enjoyed it.Kirsty Dunphey, AuthorRetired at 27, If I can do it anyone can"
4,getting a small glimpse of what makes Hillary tick,"I'm about a third of the way through the book, although I have peaked ahead. I think it's ironic that everyone's talking about the Monica episode, and that's maybe 5 percent of the book. Of course, that's probably a big selling point, and Simon & Schuster must be thrilled. ""Living History,"" however, is not the least bit prurient; I had to shake my head when I read one ""reviewer"" here say the book was filled with sex. There's no sex whatsoever (just Hillary dealing with the fallout from her husband's betrayal), and Hillary does talk about the issues she cares about. I do wish there were more anecdotes in the book, though. That's how you get a closer look at someone's character, and Hillary remains an enigma in many ways."
5,Good Read,"If you read the Clinton memoir with an open mind knowing in advance that some scores are going to be settled, you'll find the Clinton's reasoned, progressive agenda on every page. Like the President, Hillary Clinton's style of leadership is thoughtful and measured, scholarly with regard to study of policy, so utterly different than the Republicans in power now (whom she trashes effectively and mericlessly in this book including the Rhenquist court)."
5,"Dry, but fascinating.","Hillary Clinton is the focal point for conservative rage and liberal worship. Regardless of content, the political agenda of her critics or allies taint the objective appraisal of her book. However, Senator Clinton's autobiography is a perspective into recent history that certainly no one else could have provided.Overall, ""Living History"" is a compelling personal look into the events of Senator Clinton's life. Senator Clinton writes in a distant manner that lends itself to academic work, but not the ""tell all"" personal tragedy that many seem to desire. Thus, if you are looking for a confession to match your perception of Senator Clinton, ""Living History"" is obviously not for you."
1,Best work of fiction for the year 2003,"This book is the best work of fiction for 2003. Look out Harry Potter fans, this book has more fantasy and whimsical situations than all of the Harry Potter books combined. I give the writers credit for coming up with this book of fantasy. The fantasy and whimsical situations the main character is involved in are hilarious. It is a great book to use as fodder for the fire. If you really want a good laugh listen to the audio version of this book. I am surprised how life like they made the computer voice that is used in audio book. They needed to create the computer voice with some emotions."
1,"the Hilldabeast talks,and no one listens.","poorly written (not by PIAPS) fluff piece attempting to portray herself as the hapless victim of her wandering hubby, in order to garner the sympathy vote in '08.... I couldn't finish it. Costco has millions on remainder. go there if you've got to immerse yourself in this vile person."
1,"Canned, Meandering Tripe","It is truly a sad indictment of the United States when our Secretary of State only communicates in a patronizing, elitist style. This book was more comical and amusing than informative. 1/20/2013 cannot arrive soon enough....."
4,Great Book!,This is a must buy...Hillary offers great insight into her personal and private life. One of the most powerful women in politics! This is definitely a book to read and read again.
4,How far with the Repbublicans go?,"It is obvious after reading Senator Clinton's book that the Republicans will go to any length to further their cause. We are seeing this repeated in the Bush II administration. I wish the Democrats could be as evil and maybe we could find ourselves on equal footing for a true political challenge. I hope to see this woman in the White House in 2008 or 2012. I believe she has what it takes to make a strong, decent leader."
5,Surpassed all expectations - A great & must read!,"I read ""Living History"" with great interest and anticipation! As someone who did not appreciate the ways and means of the Clintons, I must say that I was impressed by what I read in this book. As a New Yorker, I voted against Hillary Clinton - however, if she ever ran again for any office, she will definitely have my vote. Hillary deserves a lot of kudos for going out and publishing this book with revelations about her very intimate matters... I recommend it to everyone - republicans, democrats, linertarians, men and women..."
1,What a distortion....,Memory is selective. Other people are giving accounts of things that happened that are completely different than the what she says. Pre-presidential baloney.
1,More of the same,"As if eight years in the White House wasn't enough, we're still being subjected to more lies, half-truths and distortions by Mrs. Clinton. To portray herself as a victim is hardly a worthy status as role model let alone presidential contender. And yes, character does matter."
1,This is Hillary,Fiction recalled? Can't remember her name before the grand jury but can write fiction and call it history. Fiction.
1,Aweful book.,"This book is aweful. Woes me, my husband had an affair and told the whole country. Could we get any more from the victim?"
1,"""His-story""","The title of this book should've been ""Outliving His-story.""But, reputatation--now more than ever--will always precede both Mr. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton. The mere passage of time, or trying to speed it up by charactarizing current life as ""history"" will not allow either of them to escape the truth."
4,The Real Hillary?,"I think this book is great. Does Hillary have political motivations for making herself appear in the best light in this book? Probably, but how many people right memoirs that make themselves seem like bad people? I did not know the details of Hillary's life, or even many of the details of Bill's presidency. It is an interesting look at the presidency and the state of the nation from the First Lady's point of view. This book is so much more than the few pages where she talks about the Monica Lewinsky debacle."
1,good fireside book,This book should be listed in the juvenile fiction section. The most dishonest and self-agrandizing bunk I've ever paged through. It's only redeeming quality is as kindling.
1,Let the fawning admiration begin.,"This book represents HRC's re-entry into the public view.It was accompanied by fawning admiration by many in the media.Ghost-written, it attempts to evoke sympathy for the 'woman scorned'. This, it is hoped, will whisk her off to the White House in 2008.Those who want to see a(n other) socialist in the Oval Office will welcome her book. Those who dread seeing the tenets of radical leftism lived day by day in the highest office of the land will criticize her book."
1,Disappointed. I expected more candor.,I expected a true and honest accounting of Bill and her rise to power - an accounting of the scandels as well as the accomplishments. Never got a sense of what kind of a person she really is. Or maybe I did. She came across as cold and uncaring. It's unbelievable how little she says.
5,"Hillary, what a inspiration!","Given the constant struggles and obstacles of Hillary's life, I found myself stressed out as I read along. At the same time, you cannot help but feel proud and inspired by her determination to fight for women and children's rights in addition to a much needed universal health care system. Her inner strength is truely remarkable given the overwelming resistance she has encountered in her life. This is a great story of an amazing life!"
5,What a book!,"Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Mr. Clinton. Let me also say that my all-time favorite book is Make Every Girl Want You by Fate and Reil, so that should give you some idea of what I'm like. Anyway, I was surprisingly impressed with this book. Hillary puts on a good front, and man has she had a life! I'd recommend reading this book, just to see all of the cool things Hillary & Bill have done in life, and the random coincidences that have accompanied her life. Overall, it's very well-written, and very entertaining. When I bought it, I wasn't sure I could make it through the entire 576 pages, but I did so without a problem. Some chapters were a little dry & boring (hey, what can I say - I like the chapters about Bill the best), but overall a great book for summer reading!"
4,David Chadwick is a buffoon,I imagine the poor fellow who wrote the long-winded and sophomoric lead review of Hilary's book either has1) a rather unhealthy obsession with anything Clinton related2) too much time on his hands due to his losing his job thanks to the current administration's economic policiesI recommend that hea) get a lifeb) get an editorc) get a ghostwriterd) get a life (did I mention that already?)e) all of the above
3,Disappointed after so much build-up,"Read the many fair assessments of people (pro & con Hillary) on this web site & you'll get the idea. Reading this is like paying full price for an eagerly anticipated movie, just to discover that you saw all the good parts during the TV commercials. It isn't even written by her. [Able as she is, she couldn't even write part of her own story? Too busy, maybe?] This was an opportunity missed. Save your money, & borrow a copy from someone who rushed out to see what all the fuss was about (like me) when they're done with it."
1,"Boring, Self-Censored.","Someone who's still a politician, thinking of running for President, is obviously not going to be very candid and honest. That's exactly what you get in this book. It's boring because it's obviously self-censored, and you wonder how much is spin and how much is true. Borrow it from a library and save your money."
1,Lies lies lies,"Remember as you read this that this wasn't written under oath. They made a big deal about how she got ""thousands"" of people at her NYC book signing. She got 1200. 1200 people in the most left wing city in the world. Howard Stern got almost fifteen thousand at the same book store. Stop lying Hildabeast!!"
1,Fictional Book,"I am very interested in politics and remember the past years of when Clinton was president. I believe what Mrs. Clinton wrote in her book (actually, she didn't write it herself, just edited it) has many discrepancies. She spins the info for her own political gain and makes excuses for her husband's lack of character and integrity. I don't believe that an intelligent and cunning person like Mrs. Clinton believed her husband when he said he did not have an affair with Ms. Lewinsky when she knew about all the other prior affairs. I believe she was angry he got caught in his lie and helped hide the truth. What they didn't know is if he would have told the truth originally, we could accept it. What I couldn't accept is his direct lying to the American People directly on TV. Her facts were not complete or truthful. To bad she will make $8 million dollars on a fictional book that is supposed to tell the true story. Don't waste your money."
1,Pure Hogwash,"This book is the first compaign appearance and the Barbara Walter's interview was a free political ad. As usual, she won't be honest, she will only say what she thinks will improve her standing in the polls. If this were such an honest, reflective book, why did she need 2 ghostwriters? As for her story that she had no idea about X-rated president clinton's affairs, that is not believable. If you believe that, you also believe she didn't hide billing records from her law firm that were under subpeona."
1,zzzzzzzz,"Hillary's ghost writers spin fiction for the True Believers. Discredited made-up excuses for the scandals, insults to her critics, falsehoods about her husband. Without Bill Clinton, this woman would be either a law partner at an obscure firm, or in jail. Either way, we (and Bill Clinton) would be better off.Read this when a friend loaned it to me. We both agreed on the book. She felt guilty over buying it..as she should. Maybe she can give it to someone as a gag gift."
1,Some of the facts,Hilary lives in a Harry Potter world. Nothing is real in her life and the facts are still hidden. This book is just a pathetic attempt to make money. There is not one thing in this book that we did not know and in fact there are things that we do know that she did not write about.Throughout history strong women have not stayed with promiscuous husbands unless the affairs were not public. Hilary seems oblivious to it all which historically is not normal. It is a good thing to forgive your husband but to act like it is no big deal is ignorance. It is a good thing that Hilary believes in abortion or there would be more Clintons running around and ruining the lives of our children and grandchildren!
1,Dosen't have a real good storyline or plot.,"While the descriptions of life in the middle 90's is quite realistic and well written, I found the character of ""Bill"" to be so smug and annoying, I couldn't begin to care what happens to him. Also, the author takes way too many liberties with the historical facts along with several holes in the plot that...wait a minute, oh this book is non-fiction?This book is a total joke, I feel sorry for the trees that were used in the printing of this sham."
5,Hillary is a precious Gem,"I read ""Living History"" and enjoyed it immensely. I've always admired Hillary Clinton, and after reading this book I admire her even more. The book is very well written and quite personal. I read a few of the bad reviews here by people who obviously hate her. It always tickles me that people who hate her spend so much time giving her attention. If you don't like Hillary then why did you spend time reading her book? Anyway, Hillary is an extraordinary women, and unfortunately smart, strong, extraordinary women are still despised by many in this society, including other women. I'm glad that Hillary is a NY Senator and when she decides to run for President she has my vote."
2,Living History,"Ho hum, pretty much a waste of my time reading it and not factual as I remember events. the time lines didn`t fit. History rewrite."
1,"Typically Clintonesque, self-serving distortion of the facts","Hillary is in denial. The way she describes her ""history"" in the White House is typical of the political spin that the public was subjected to during the Clinton administration. She would have us believe that everything that went right with the country during that time was attributable to she and Bill, and everything that went wrong was at the hand of the Republicans, past and present. The book will be welcomed by those who wish to reinforce their belief that Hillary has been misunderstood, unfairly treated, and subjected to undue harassment by her enemies."
1,Lying History,There isn't much to recommend about this book. It should be listed under Fiction headings.
1,Disappointing,"Whether or not you're a Republican or a Democrat, I think you would be very disappointed after reading this book. It was more of a fictional campaign story rather than a story of her true life."
1,Should be In FICTION section,"This is a pathetically spun jumble of words with no substance. Many statements are contradictary or false (there are many references to prove this fact). From Hillary's ""surprise"" about Bill's infidelity to her thoughts on health care; this book is one waste of time.AS Ann Coulter summed it up in a recent article about Hillary:""I could hardly breathe. Gulping for air, I started crying and yelling, ""What do you mean? What are you saying? Why are the Clintons back again?"""
1,Tales of a liar,"Living history should be called lying history.Hillary, like her hubby Bill is a liar. She like her hubby is consumed by her own ego and hubris. Hill, like Bill, can't ever admit she is wrong. Se always has an excuse.If you must read this book, borrow it from a friend, buy is used, or get it from the library. Why pay for it and have the liar get your money."
1,"Chapters Ms. Clinton ""forgot"" (cough) to add:","Bimbo EruptionsCreative InvestingFun with World Wide TravelMy Devotion to GhandiThe Vast Right Wing ConspiracyDan LasaterCraig LivingstoneNow where did those files go to again?The meaning of the word ""is""Osama Bin who?CarpetbaggingSmearing the Trailer Park Trash (Sorry, Roger)Janet Reno: My little b#tch"
1,Leave China Alone,"...I think this book is the purenes of hypocrisy, self serving purpose and other ulterior motives, in a way to erase the memories of the clinton's failures, deciet and lies in the mind of the people."
1,self-serving,"Ignore the fact that she is the former first lady. Ignore the fact that a bunch of stupid NY'ers voted for this carpet bagger and she now attempts to represent her constituency by inventing non-issues to fight for (someone's failure to tell NY'ers that black, foul-smelling air from the burning twin towers was unhealthy - this is raw common sense, see I told you they were stupid).This book is just a self-serving revisionist view of history and how it never happened by one power hungry feminist. Go away Hillary."
1,Excellent Fiction,"This book belongs in the FICTION section! It is beyond belief that Hillary did not know what was going on LONG before she says she ""found out"". The book is nothing more than a political tool generated as a stepping stone toward her coveted goal of gaining the Presidency of the United States. God help us all if she attains that goal!"
5,Hillary's Excellent Book,I bought this book the day it went on sale and have enjoyed reading it very much. It helped me relive the years from 1980-2000. Hillary is an excellent writer and this is a studious autobiography.
2,"A writer, Hillary is not...","I have to start off by saying that Hillary is a great woman, with many strengths and a very strong knowledge of politics. I want to be her when I ""grow up"". However, I am in the mid 50s page wise in the book and i honestly am sort of turned off by how much political ""mumbo jumbo"" there is in this book. I wouldn't call it so much a memoir, as it mostly recalls political happenings and Hillary's connection and feelings towards these events. It is far from being personable and that makes me feel sort of disappointed and I fear that I will be saving this book for a later date. It just has not lived up to what I thought it would be and is more of a chore to read. I want to go on the record saying that I hope Hillary does have her day in the White House as president and I want her to know that I will support her all the way. However, if she writes a follow up to this book, I will be more hesitant to run out and buy it."
1,Hillary's travel log,"While reading the book I kept telling my husband ""I can't belive she was paid eight million for this"" Three quarters of the book is about her world travels as first lady most likely ghosted by her aides. If you are really curiuos about the book after all the publicity, borrow the book from the library. It is not worth the money."
2,A bit too careful,"I have to admit that I only read half this book because I became bored by it. What could have been an explosive, fun, book is tepid and predictable because it seems to be written with one eye on the next election. I wish Hillary had written the book we would have all loved to have read. She would have become a billionaire if she did and could have dumped the husband she has now. Instead, she plays it safe....and boring."
1,The Rewriting of History Lived,"What can I say except, typical Clintonian non-sense. David Brinkley said it best, ""a bore"". Save your money, buy your prescription drugs with the money you save."
1,Absolutely unbearable,"This is a terrible book. First of all, Hillary Clinton did not write it. It's a common fact. She wrote it to make a name for herself so she can run in 2008. She is a force trying to ruin the 9 Democrats who are running for 2004. Most people with a brain understand that Hillary Clinton is a cold, calculating woman.It's a bad book for simple-minded people."
2,I do not suggest this book,"For me, the book was particularly a big bore. It seems as though her autobiography is an attempt to glorify her years sidelined in the White House. The book can only be truly enjoyed by Hillary enthusiasts. I'm not a critic of Hillary Clinton, but specifically this book was written with very dry, shriveled style. If you'd like to read a decent biography of Hillary Clinton, I suggest Carl Bernstein's biography of her."
2,This Is Neither Living or History,"It is doubtful that Ms. Clinton spent much time putting pen to paper on this work, however she has willing and talented associates who will and who did. The problem with a book ostensibly written by someone as controversial as she is, is that it will beg off anything truly controversial and spend it's time instead in spinning the events of her life as she would like them reported for future campaigns. This book is nothing more than a puff piece of politcal advertising and if you are a Hillary fan, you will probably enjoy it. If not. save your money."
3,'Okay' sums it up,"I agree with some of the low-rating comments. This book is very one-sided, and the narrative is sometimes patronizingly simple in a way that reads like children's literature. Stylistically, it's pretty bland: ""X happened, and then Y happened, and then our daughter said something funny and Bill and I came to realize Z."" Blah.However, I did also come away with some sense of HRC's motivations and personal feelings about some salient issues. I voted for her in the primaries, but as an academic interested in discourse analysis, I realize that I had actually read a great deal of negative press (and several scathingly critical books) on her, and very, very little of material she had produced herself. This book is worth the read. (The audiobook version is also recommended.)"
2,Absent Of Any Distinguishing Personality,"The skies were clear and blue on the morning of September 11th, 2001 and yet there was something in the air. Hillary Clinton's descriptions of important events are akin to looking at a painting that has been edited by photoshop. Her bloodless image of America and her life experiences in it over the last fifty years will leave you yawning. There is no emotion in her prose, only clean typeface absent of any distinguishing personality. If you wonder why she lost the 2008 Primary to Barack Obama, this work of carefully chosen memories is a good indication. If there is a real Hillary Clinton, she is so hard to find that even her editor struggled to craft the semblence of a real person. It's a shame really. For a woman who has done so much for the country, she really should find the courage to admit her flaws without faking it."
2,Pulp history,"Objectively speaking on the book, not political ideals, this is disappointing. While the Lewinsky affair is included to sell copies, it tells you nothing new and white washes the details. As for her policy take, it really is vague and goes out of it's way to not make a definite stand on anything."
2,just a dull read,"this compilation (which hillary didn't write!) is a decent encyclopedia of information you already know regarding bill clinton and the starr report.everything new worth knowing from the book has already been divulged in hillary's book interviews. this is all style over substance; if you must own this thing, at least wait for the paperback to come out."
1,Living History,"I was just writing to inform you that some misclassified this book; it should be listed in under fiction, fantasy."
1,Non Fiction? I don't think so !,"I found myself fighting to stay awake for this one. Some of her stories are believable but some just are false, and they can be proven to be so. My advise- save your money or give what you would spend on this book to chairity !"
1,"Self-promotion, most of which was written by others.","You may be entertained, but don't expect historical accuracy. The only time you will ever get the truth from this author is when the truth is more effective than a lie."
1,Nothing New,"This book provides nothing new to anyone who watched the news during the 90's. Asking us to believe that she was so surprised by this first episode of her husbands unfaithfulness strains credibility. I lived in Arkansas during the 80's when Bill was governor, and there was nothing special about either of them.Hillary has a famous name, but little actually needed by our country. Save your money!"
2,Amazing Memory,"Her story was choppy, and difficult to follow. I found it anti-climatic with no real news, yet I found 2 things interesting: 1) how she implied that much of Bill's success was her doing, and, 2) how well her memory has been to write this book, yet it was so poor for Whitewater investigators and the Press.My overall impression is that this book was not intended for us to ""look back in retrospect at her living history"", but much more intended for us to consider her in 2008.New York is not a stepping stone??? I now believe that New York's function for Hillary is more intended to be a catapult than a stepping stone. Politicians in America are supposed to serve the public. In Hillary's view it seems the public is there to serve her. In Hillary's world, we are the ""little people"".She's very smart, I'll grant her that, but smart in a cold, calculating way, almost scary. Save your money and get this book from the post office."
1,Truth or fiction,What is most striking about this book is what it does not say. I cannot remember ever having read a more self serving autobiography.
1,"Disgusting, obscene and full of lies","I don't get it. I used to be a sharply left-wing Democrat, but after reading Living History, I changed my party to Republican, and I became a strict conservative. This book is absolute trash, and proves my former partie's point that too many trees are being destroyed for human ""needs"". Clintoon (yes, toon) didn't even write this example of totalitarian propaganda on historical happenings, and she is a huge disgrace to all of her miserable likspittles. I thank Clintoon for showing me which way of thinking is moral, just and on the correct side of history (the conservative way). Don't waste your hard earned, welfare money on this liberal bible."
3,profile of a president wanna be,"I just thought I was a detailed person - Hilary has me beat. Easy enough reading, but felt I was being prepped for her future presidential campaign."
5,What a woman!,"I have to give it to Hillary Clinton. Her life story is certainly an interesting one. I appreciated the opportunity to get some insight into how she became the strong-willed, capable person woman of today."
4,Righties didn't even read it!,"This is a book filled with policy. If you liked the Clinton's and their policies, you'll like this book. If you didn't and you are here, there is probably a pretty good chance you never will and your sole purpose for coming here is to right a bogus review so that you can repeat some rhetoric you heard on talk radio and give it a single star in order to lower the overall rating. I mean get real here!...Is it a good book? Just like any policy book, it depends on your own perspective. What it is is well written, thoughtful, and obviously the work of someone with a great deal more intellect than many current pols. If you are a ""ditto Rush"" kind of person, you won't like it. If you are open to the idea that maybe someone who was integrally involved in an administration that coincided with the most properous period in American history might have some insights to offer, you'll find it a good read."
1,Ongoing embarassment,It was annoying from the opening pages because Mrs. Clinton had absolutely nothing relevant to say. Too much name dropping and oversharing which made me wonder if was she writing for historical record or to inflate her personal ego.
3,Interesting but not what I expected.,"I believe that Hillary Clinton is a brilliant person so I expected her book to be full of valuable insights. I didn't much care if it was the ""tell all"" some claimed it would be. It was neither. But there was enough there that it was worth the read."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"After reading the first few chapters of this book I wondered if I would make it to the end. Luckily, somewhere in Arkansas that all changed. This book really gives the reader a behind the scenes account of the pressures and influence a dignitary has, and how a modern woman faces challenges beyond most of society's comprehension. It's exciting to read engaging details of her small blunders and personal triumphs in the public eye as a ""First Lady in training"". I recommend this book to any woman in your life as a source of inspiration."
2,Don't go in there. it's nasty!!!,"I'm ill. It appears gone are the days when a nice pant suit is considered a safe alternative to looking sexy and hip. Mrs. Clinton, if you were a grill, I would lay down a bunch of charcoal, squirt it generously with lighter fluid, put a match to it (from a safe distance) let it build up a nice bed of glowing coals, and then cook a medium to medium-well cheeseburger on your grate because damn girl, you HOT!"
1,HILLARY IN WONDERLAND,"THE CLINTONS' ARE SO DILLUSIONAL THAT THEY NEED TO CREATE THEIR OWN COUNTRY, CALL IT CLINTONIA AND MOVE THERE, SO THEY CAN RULE THEIR IDIOTIC SUBJECTS (LIKE BARBRA STRAISAND, MICHAEL MOORE, ET ALL) AS THEY WISH. IN THE CLINTONS' WORLD, EVERYONE IS WRONG, AND THEY ARE RIGHT. SO, GET THE HECK OVER TO CLINTONIA, ALREADY! GOOD RIDDANCE I SAY--THIS BOOK IS FULL OF CRAP...."
5,KISS Family Jewels,"Before Gene Simmons had Gene Simmons's Family Jewel on A & E. He was the front man for the rock group KISS. That no news there..However it is Simmons's retelling of the KISS story that is a page turner.What makes this book intriguing is the author's blunt retelling of his life and his band's back story. Simmons does hype his story nor the KISS empire, he shoot the truth from the heart and the gut. He is frank and honest about the band's up and downs. Its successes and it failures.The book ends in 2001, when the band reunites..and you feel like you been on a small rollercoaster ride of life. WOW what a ride! Get it and read it yourselfBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,"Gene to a ""T""","If you've ever heard Gene Simmons interviewed, then you know exactly what to expect from this book: it's contrived and stilted and carefully calculated to boost the Kiss legend. According to Gene, Kiss invented virtually everything in music and was second only to the Beatles in greatness (not too much an overstatement, huh?). But, read in the right light, the stilted language (""...then I had a liaison with this girl..."") and diatribe (""Ace did nothing."") can be pretty funny."
1,This aint no autobiography... this is nothingness.,"So Mr. Chaim Witz has put pen to paper and gave us his life story. I don't believe one ounce of this rubbish. The book has been written by a ghost writer, and a not very good one at that. This isn't the story of Gene Simmons' life, it is a story about a member of the band KISS, and the story is all too familiar and boring. Gene come on and give us your real story. I want to read about the intellectual Gene Simmons, not the media hype that is this rubbish. This is nothingness."
4,Who is Behind the Makeup?,"I have read on many online message boards that Gene wrote the book himself, but on some other boards it says that he ""enlisted the help"" of Ben Greenman, who is a writer and editor at the New Yorker. What does this mean exactly? Did Gene write the book and did Ben Greenman edit it? Or did Ben Greenman actually write it? I don't think this makes the book any less cool -- Gene is the best rock star ever, hands down -- but I am curious."
2,Gene Simmons Boring?,"YES! Gene Simmons book is boring. I was expecting more detail when telling of past relationships. I know Gene lived with Cher and Diana, but that's it?!? I know Gene has had sex with thousands of women, but that's it?!? I know Shannon is the love of Genes' life, but that's it?!? I was expecting a book I couldn't put down. Instead I bought I book I had trouble finishing."
2,Worth a Buy for the Fan,"No Ghost ? Really....The KISSfaq.com states that this book was ""Ghost-written by Ben Greenman, editor of ""The New Yorker""...""the Kissfaq.com has rarely been wrong, not ever as far as I know.And Yes, I did Purchase the HardBack, as well as the Paperbacks."
1,Kiss and Go Home,"Kiss and make-up is probably the most uninteresting book of its kind. It's one of those books that you can't put down, but wished you never picked up. I bought mine used and overpaid. Gene Simmons is definitly a profit mongor. I think this book was written just to put the name Kiss on it, and sell it. Gene is arrogant, concieted, and juvenile. Need I say more?"
2,exactly what I thought it would be,"I've never liked Gene Simmons, but have always respected his business mind - he really was a pioneer in the realm of mass marketing. But as a person, he always seemed like a completely arrogant, self-absorbed, insufferable jerk. The book did not change my mind about either. The book is dreadfully in need of an editor - one who would have advised more structure and focus rather than Gene's random experiences with poontang and his selective recollection of KISStory. It seems totally obvious to me that he cut a deal with Paul Stanley to remain virtually silent on any good juice; the book is strangely devoid of Stanley stories. It also seems obvious that one of Gene's main objectives is to make Ace and Peter look as foolish and incompetent as possible. Gene, to me, has always had a propensity to say a lot without really saying anything at all. His biography follows suit."
5,Drink and Drug Free (just like the Nuge),"No alcohol or drugs? Just like Ted Nugent. I would have never guessed it. How is this possible in the rock'n roll concert environment? This to me is the great mystery of this book and the life it chronicles. Great color photos included. ""I want to rock'n roll all night and party every day"" is the KISS mantra, but ""party"" = alcohol and/or drugs in the American media TV culture of the last 50 years. So what did those lyrics mean to him? He was never a partier. Successful sober guy lives an amazing life. He would be an excellent speaker at addiction clinics. The book provides much insight into the frustrations of the sober guy dealing with the two ""partiers"" in the band. I'd like to see a book of all the pictures he took of the women he says he had... his numbers, like Wilt's, don't seem credible. More likely these are pictures of all the girls who were around the scene. Bizarre life for sure, and a very entertaining read."
5,"Great read, he ain't Hemingway, but he's good!","I really enjoyed this book, and laughed out loud quite often. I love the plain spoken honesty. There were some surprises in here, but nothing off-putting. I'll echo everyone else: I really want Paul to write a book. There is the brains, heart, and soul of the band."
2,Nihilism not needed,OK. Sex and Money is certainly the basis for many an entertaining read but this guy really has nothing to offer. His nihilistism devalues any insights he might offer - unless you really care about how this guy made money despite the fact that he doesnt care for music - and he is sure you dont either. Hmmm.
1,"Lord, will you just shut up already?","If Gene's mission is to destroy Kiss . ..Nice Goin' Pal! Mission accomplished! No matter how many times this ego-driven lunkhead slams Ace & Peter (and no matter how ignorant he seems to be to the fact that the true Kiss fans he claims to serve are sickened each time he does so), the rest of us know a simple truth that continues to elude ol' Cod Piece himself: Ace, Peter, Paul and Gene are Kiss. Very simple equation. Only these four parts equal the whole. Learn it, Gene, or just shut up already, will ya?"
