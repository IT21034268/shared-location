1,Tedious at best,"Poorly written. Simply putting an exclamation point after a sentence doesn't make it astounding! Or Exciting! And the overuse of quotation marks gives this ""book"" an odd feel. Poorly written and poorly researched. Stay away...or better yet, buy my copy from me. It's too small for the birdcage."
4,White House stories,Great book about the White House and those who lived there. Easy read and very interesting stories. I enjoyed it a lot.
2,"Shallow, alas","The stories collected here are good, and the job of compiling them admirable, but the writing is either leaden or arch. A really good editor might have tightened the book a bit."
3,Innovative but doesn't wear as well as hoped,"I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out. I was totally mesmerized by it's tempo, music, characters and story. I could strangely identify with the culture clashes and wannabe attitudes. For a low budget venture, it still is a very successful movie. But, today, the themes (identity, cultural conflict, capitalism, etc.) would need more fleshing out (not that any contemporary films do this well), only because these themes remain problematic today. However, Stranger Than Paradise is always worth looking at again for its ""raw"" filmmaking, quirky characters, being a friendly reminder from the past."
5,WELCOME TO AMERICA ONLY IT GETS MUCH MUCH WORSE,"Road film for the eighties: From Bing and Bob in the forties to Dennis and Peter in the sixties and now this in the eighties. Welcome to America. Where is the wonder? Where is the song?This movie is the best representation of where we have come from and of where we went wrong. Where is that American Dream?Please see this movie deeply. Let it take time. Watch Mystery Train and Ghost Dog too. You will see what there is to see and what is only whispered.Why movies? This is why. Watch.Nuff sed.After this film grab a real human being by the hand and hold on tightly.Or get a small cool old school black hat full of no hope and squeeze in.This film comes real cheap.You'll never see the inside of a hotel room the same way again.This is what My Name's Earl WANTS TO BE BUT NEVER WILL DARE TO BE.Turn this on instead and tune in.Throw this frisbee no further than your DVD box, but deeper than your deepest understanding."
3,STRANGE Story,"It is a really strange movie consisting of the visually separated scenes telling a story of a Hungarian tourist-turned-illegal-emigrant (or what?) having spent a few nights with handsome cousin in New York to move in Cleveland.Some threesome thematic, some migrant in-site, some nothing-to-do-but-gambling story executed with separating the characters and leaving a ""tourist"" with a couple of thousand dollars handed to her mistakenly.Beautiful actors perform brilliantly a story of nothing to say of."
1,Taking indie worship too far,"There are certainly a ton of excellent independent films. This is not one of them. Bad cinematography, bad acting, bad writing (Lurie gets stuck with some AWFUL lines), zero-dimensional characters. Hey, boring people live boring lives, WE GET THE POINT ALREADY."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzz,"Dull doesn't begin to describe this movie. I got the feeling that the camera man was on quaaludes, and the actors wished they were. We did get a few laughs out of the movie, but I assure you, the director didn't mean them.I'm not quite sure why anyone would think of this 'story' and even put it down on paper, let alone make a movie out of it. I'm pretty easy to please, but when the most exciting moment in a whole movie is a toss-up between someone's aunt winning a hand of cards, or someone else swiping a vase off a shelf, I have to say pass on this one, and spend your money on something a little more entertaining."
5,Stranger Than Paradise is a great movie,"Stranger Than Paradise is the most original, sensitive, intelligently humorous and satisfying movie I have ever seen. Someday, if not already, it will rank with the greatest movies of all time. In my opinion, Stranger Than Paradise is a masterpiece of film making. I own this movie and I don't own many, not many at all. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a movie of unique vision, originality and content."
4,Beckett on film,"Forsaking exposition and climactic plot structure, Jim Jarmusch presents life as it really is, rather than how we would like to see it.Episodic, faltering, low-key, and languishing in quiet desperation, this film takes many of its cues from playwrights Bertolt Brecht and Samuel Beckett, highlighting the aimlessness and absence of emotional connection between individuals. The main characters go from place to place, attempting to bring some life to their non-lives, but are only spinning their wheels.The viewer is inclined to laugh at some of the more absurd moments, as Willie and Eddie sit in an awkward silence over a few beers... but the end result is a desire to not be these people, to find an escape from the meaninglessness of modern life."
5,JIM JARMUSCH IS A HERO TO THE CINEMA WORLD,"How my ratings work:5 - I really liked/loved it4 - I liked it3 - Could've been better/worth a look2 - Just didn't live up to the potential1 - Simply awfulJim Jarmusch is one of my all time favorite directors. His movies have a style all their own, and you can tell he truly puts his heart and soul into all his work. It's Jarmusch who helped to move the independent revolution further to what it is today. Thank God for guys like Jim Jarmusch. Stranger Than Paradise is wonderfull: it's well acted, the cinematography is beatiful and I love that song buy the legendary Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Anyone who truly loves movies will love Stranger Than Paradise."
2,A little too minimal,"Next to your average, American Joe, I consider myself to be pretty preferential to minimalism, but this is a little past where I draw the line. I really wanted to like this movie, but nothing happens. Maybe somehow that's the point, and I just didn't get it or something, but it's boring as hell. The performances are good, but most of the time the actors aren't acting; they're just sitting there as the camera films them. It's a lot like watching a friend's home movies, except only the stuff where nothing's really happening. I didn't count the lines in the film, but I'm pretty sure I could. The camera work is good and so is the editing, but those things alone couldn't hold my interest."
5,A Work of Art,"The first time I watched ""Stranger than Paradise"" was by accident. I turned on the TV - at the time I lived in Berlin/Germany - and there was this piece of film that was strange and fascinating and different and beautiful. Black and white and seemingly slow compared to Hollywood Standards. If normal movies are like novels, then this movie is like poetry. It truly is a piece of art. The photography is strong and beautiful but never without a purpose. This is one of the few movies where images tell the story. I watched it many times and I love it more than any other movie I have seen in my lifetime. It is ""stranger than paradise""."
5,stranger than anything,"A Hungarian girl goes to visit her cousin who lives in the ugliest apartment in the ugliest part of New York City; then the cousin and his best friend go to visit the Hungarian girl who now lives in the ugliest house in the ugliest part of Cleveland; then all three of them take a road trip and end up at the ugliest hotel in the ugliest part of Florida. Along the way nothing happens, and then it happens again. A great film, and an important one too, that I thoroughly enjoyed watching."
3,Decent.,"I wanted a dive watch that I didn't have to baby and this being such low cost (by dive watch standards) and being a quartz movement fit that bill. It's a very handsome watch and if the bezel rotated more accurately then I would have given it 5 stars. It ratchets nice and stiff but doesn't hit the 12 o'clock spot exactly. It is just a hair off, which bothers me. Also, the lume on this watch is downright horrible. I returned it and got a Seiko diver for only a few dollars more.Edit: After being unimpressed with the lume and overall quality I had to remove another star."
2,Could be better,"I purchased this item for my 5 year old daughter who loves Barbie. It is a simple game, but maybe a little too simple. She got bored with it really fast. She played it once and never again. The board was very flimsy and not made well."
4,Works Great,"Great little radio, installed on my fishing boat, can't find a single negative issue, price was great, rain and fog is no problem."
4,"Great product, hard to find locally","I searched up and down and no one local to me had this. All the local retailers had a cheaper brand which I don't trust.Only wish this thing was made of a more heavy-duty metal that could withstand a pneumatic wrench for taking on and off.If you use regular hand tools you won't have any problems with this. I've been using McGard wheel locks of different varieties for years.Never any rust, never any problems. All the sets I've bought came with different ""key chucks"" and NONE have ever matched each other.I see that as a positive - as in someone won't be able to buy a set of these wheel locks and open your locks with them. :)"
3,Scientific novel.,"A story about the human beings behind the scientific discoveries: their dirty tricks, resentments, subversive attacks; in one word, their not so scientific behaviour in their competitive struggle to solve cosmological problems, e.g. the Hubble constant.The central figure of the book is Allan Sandage, chief astronomer at the Mount Wilson telescope: his evolution from star watcher to computer freak.This book is not an introduction to modern physics. Readers should have a fairly good knowledge of modern cosmology and quantum physics. Although the discussions about the Hubble constant, dark matter and the Guth inflation are impressively treated.If you like novels about scientists and scientific debates, this is a good one. If you prefer popular science, there are other authors to recommend, like Paul Davies, Brian Greene, John Gribbin or Heisenberg himself. I prefer the second ones."
1,Inaccuracies,"Lonely Hearts has numerous inaccuracies that I am aware of, a clear result of the author not reading first-hand sources."
2,Better than notepad.... but barely,"The only real advantage to using Visual Age for Java is its support for team development. Compared to most environments, this IDE is simply behind the times....The some of the good features are that many people can work on the same class at the same time without any problems, it gives you one function (not one class file) to work on at a time. Integrated JAVADOC and quick and easy formatting.Some of the bad things are that the IDE does not assist the developer with things that people have come to expect, like drop down lists and the Navigation is very difficult at best!Overall.... If you have to work in a team, this is something you might want to look into, if not, most other IDE's are better."
1,WTF?,"You know the theory. Heads up programming will replace heads down programming. Everybody will use beans at design time. Guess what? Its another science project with more hype than reality. After 4 days of fiddling, I finally got an Visual age to author a bean that adds two numbers. Another fine productivity breakthrough. The visual age product only shows one method/property at a time in the IDE. What were they thinking? This is probably the worse IDE I have ever tried....And I have evaluated *MANY* of them."
5,Top notch,"This is a top quality double album!Rather than the usual mixture of famous tracks and fillers, this is has tune after tune of excellent trance.Whether you want to know what trance is all about, or are a trance fan who wants the definitive mix, this CD is for you.A shame its only available on import, but it is still worth the money."
2,Great scenery & animal footage; lame story line,"I am probably prejudice because I know the film makers and some of the animals personally, but regardless, I feel the scenery is breathtaking (I LOVE Alaska!) and the filming was done well. However, the story doesn't flow, the acting and some of the audio is very poor (especially the scene where the guy is arrested). If as much work was put into the story and acting as was in the filming of the animals, scenery, explosion, avalanche, plane crash, etc., it would have been a MUCH better movie. As is, after watching it once, it seems more enjoyable to watch it and leave the sound on mute."
3,"five stars for brilliance, one star for perversity and depression","this movie is brilliant - quick, smart, and funny - got me to laugh out loud many times, which is rare for a movie, especially one created over thirty years ago. for that i give it five stars.BUT, i average those five stars with one star for the sick negatives of the movie: the palpable negativity and perversity of Woody Allen (like this is news to anyone!), the pointless casual sex which is killing our species, the ultimately hopeless message that dating and romance is the way (it's not!), and the lack of anything deeply redeeming in the piece.i used to think this was a great movie overall - goes to show how sick and lost i used to be. this time around i couldn't finish watching it. i also used to be able to finish off two macdonald's whoppers, a large fries, and a coke. not anymore! my stomach now knows what's good for it!"
4,why opposites attract each other,"Alvy is an adult stuck in a child's point of view, Annie's character grows; because Alvy is pushing her to become the women he wants her to be. Lots of fun, sad ending.And this beat out first Star War's movie for Best Picture??"
5,One of Woody's best,"Annie Hall is one of those films that I could watch over and over again. I first caught it a few years ago. I know, I know, it was made in the late 70s.Anyway, I've seen some of Woody Allen's other movies and, though I like some of them, ""Annie Hall"" is my favorite.I heard Mr. Allen say that he was not happy with this film. I think he thinks that to make a great film it has to be ""serious."" Annie Hall touches on a lot of elements. It is serious in a way with regard to relationships.Allen has done a wonderful job directing this movie with a light touch.Diane Keaton was just adorable and I think it was the very best role she has ever gotten. As an actor, Allen plays himself but he doesn't make any bones about it. He is believable.The cinematography by Gordon Willis is superb"
2,What was that about?,"I am aware that this movie won an Oscar but truly, I have not a slightest idea why. ""Annie Hall"" in my opinion is the worst Woody Allen's movie out of all those I've seen so far. Worse even than ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" and ""Cassandra's Dream."" It was impossible for me to connect with the story, I couldn't understand the relationship between Allen's character and Annie, the movie itself was directed in a very strange way. I don't know, I didn't really enjoy it, but I was able to finish watching it and for that I gave it 2 stars."
2,Has 1977 written all over it,"Although parts of Annie Hall remain tremendoulsy funny, the movie as a whole is so hopelessly dated it is downright painful to watch at times.If you REALLY want to relive the late 1970's than this is for you. Otherwise it is time to move on."
1,BEWARE! BAD BLU-RAY,"This is a great, classic movie! Too bad they mangled the blu-ray. This blu-ray has bad sync. This makes me very sad. Inexcusable!"
5,Excellent film. A classic.,"Annie Hall is a one-of-a-kind film. It's not quite as funny as Woody Allen's more slapstick earlier films (such as Bananas, Sleeper, and Take the Money and Run), but this film won Best Picture for a reason."
5,One of the best of all time!,"This film is the reason film reveiws go to 5 stars. AFter repeated viewings over the years, I'm not so sure ANNIE HALL isn't one of a few films that should make reviews adopt a sixth star. It is the quintessential movie of the 70s. Woody Allen breaks new ground that was solely his to break."
4,Annie's got my pick,"Annie Hall is a light and whimsical journey through the New York dating game. As usual, Woody Allen pokes plenty of fun at himself and Diane Keaton turns in a great performance.Basically, this is a movie about what it is like for older people to try and date while in New York City. It does not help when the man, Woody Allen, suffers from Social Anxiety Disorder. What follows is good old fashioned fun. It is laugh out loud funny at points, and generally just a feel good movie.This is one that everyone should see."
3,Best Picture?,"I collect the winners of the ""Best Picture"" category and was surprised to see this as a winner. The film was different but not exciting and nor did it draw me under suspense. The humor in the film was typical of Woody Allen but to me really dry. If you are a Woody Allen fan, you will enjoy this transfer onto Blu-ray as it was cleanly done."
3,OK,"This movie is rated # 31 on Newsweek Magazine's ""Best 100 movies of the last century"". I am collecting these. I would place this Woody Allen classic at # 75"
5,This is my all time favorite movie.,"This movie cannot be said enough about. Woody Allen is at his best, and Dianne Keaton is amazing, as always. The writing is highly intelligent, and the story is one that anyone who has ever had a relationship will love."
5,the film that got me back into Woody,"I had tried and tried and oh how I tried to enjoy Woody Allen films, but after being dragged to Hannah and Her Sisters when I was younger and sitting through a number of Allen's films, I just couldn't get there. I could only say that I had enjoyed What's Up Tiger Lilly and his segment in ""New York Stories"" called ""Oedipus Wrecks"". Annie Hall changed all this. Since seeing this movie 4 years ago, I'm now a rabid Allen fan and would count this as one of the top 20 films of all time. Maybe top 10 (I'm still working on this comprehensive list). Well, go on, you know you gotta see it."
5,"La de da, la de da,...","This was the film that made me want to work in the movie business. Great, yet offbeat non-Hollywood like script, and charming Diane Keaton, help make this one of the best motion pictures of all time. Woody, as always, playing the 40ish, Jewish, neurotic... but he does it so well!Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Shelley Duval, Christopher Walken and even Paul Simon, are all terrific in this story about two people growing apart.Flawless editing by Ralph Rosenblum. This genius really helped create the structure of the film to make it the polished gem that it is. (The hilarious ""cocaine"" scene was constructed simply because the audience needed to know that Allen/Keaton were going to the California.)I was so happy when it won all the Oscars that it did, despite what a lot of other folks thought. Witty as hell and as American as apple pie... well, maybe with a Matzoh crust!"
3,Are All His Movies about Himself?,"I've seen one other Woody Allen movie (Deconstructing Harry). Are all his movies about himself? I just don't get it. He really is not very fascinating. Self-obsessed, and often boring. There were a handful of really funny moments in this. You probably could have squeezed it into a tight, funny 15-minute short. It deserves three stars for that. Otherwise, extremely overrated Woody Allen (if this is close to his real life, boy, how obnoxious he is!)."
2,More like an extended T.V. show,"Maybe I'm too used to seening episodes of 'Seinfeld', 'Friends', and other modern sitcoms, but 'Annie Hall' felt like one of those T.V. shows, just extended. Although some scenes are very funny, most of the movie is not. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton look uneven as a couple and I didn't see what the point of the film was. At the same time, I didn't believe in their relationship. I wasn't convinced of their attraction toward each other so it was even harder to feel sympathy for Allen's character. Many times throughout, I felt like I was watching a pointless film. Allen has a free spirit tone, but his nervous and shaky character became old and annoying fast. Maybe I'm not easily amused, but then again, maybe 'Annie Hall' isn't all that funny."
1,horrible,"bad movie dont buy it, you'll never finish it it's really boring and has bad sound and picture with a devastatingly terrible plot"
2,Why couldn't they just have been lunch buddies like on Seinfeld?,"Diane Keaton kind of throws herself at Woody Allen who plays it cool (maybe smug.) I hate his khaki pants and I didn't really notice how impressive Diane Keaton looked in old suits. I totally missed the era when this movie was always mentioned in the media and I'm glad I did. Most of the time, I thought I would have clobbered Woody Allen if he had talked to me that way but I don't think this is true love or even love. I think this was an exercise in misdirection."
1,"talk, talk, talk","Like all Woody Allen movies, this one is endless, pointless talking about irrelevant boring stuff. I know Allen has his fans, but they must all be people with an ability to listen to actors talk...and talk...and talk. That's all that happens in a Woody Allen movie. Continuous non-stop banter, seasoned with a lot of complaining and angst."
5,Wonderful and funny,My family enjoyed Pastor Greg. This is a good show and very funny with a message and without the dark humor that we do not like. We think all families will love Pastor Greg.
2,"Oh no,","This movie started off with potential, but the end was just pathetic. However, as a Christian it would have been better to see Pastor Greg work out his insecurities with God and not be so weak, if he had to be so weak, fine, but let him use the scripture to pull himself out of it. He started off with a confidence level of 10 and ended up with 0. His weakness was pathetic rather than funny. I won't recommend this movie. If you can watch it for free, do so."
5,"long lasting,family game.","this is a very fun game you can enjoy it for days because its a long game it will take more than 2 days.At some parts its hard but at others its easy if you dont enjoy please say why.Its a very appropriate game for all ages.Theres at least 20 monsters from the show in the game.Your objective is to save velma,shaggy,fred and daphney.there is like no violence you hit the monsters and they dissapear not like its that bad or anything its not near anything like real wrestling/fighting.there is no realistic violence and Adult language they dont cuss in the game,And if it was a movie I'd rate it g.there is no gun useage.There are no scenes of death or murder.There is no gore or Mature content."
4,Great family fun,"My 4-year-old, who is already the world's biggest Scooby-Doo fan, gives this a hearty thumbs-up. It's a fun game for both father and son. The action's pretty good, a standard platformer, nothing innovative, but not a bad one either. The greatest part is the faithfulness to the source material. It's a real Saturday morning nostalgia blast for '70s kids with the real voices of the actors, very expressive animation and the villains from the show's original run. There's even a cameo appearance from Don Knotts as the groundskeeper! And the best part? No Scrappy Doo. Not even Scooby Dum -- unless there's a Gameshark cheat I don't know about. :) Anyway, lots of fun for little ones, probably a little hard without some grown-up help, but not that tough. Doesn't appear to be too huge, but there is probably some replayability for Scooby fans young and old."
3,Cute,I liked this game. There were things to figure out and places to wander. My only complaint is that I got stuck in the middle of the game and couldn't figure out where to go. It was a lot of fun though before that.
3,Scooby Doo Night of 100 frights,"Had to quit towards the end because of impossible jumps, very discouraging."
3,For my grandson,This is a cute game lil low tech for my grandson even being 6 yr old but he plays it.
2,fun if it would work,"well my kids LOVE this game for the 2 days it worked, now it only locks up. Can't return it so I am Stuck. It is not scratched , just locks up . had tears from my kids, and vowed to never buy another game again. Stuck with $30 and no game to play."
2,I hate it,"it is annoying to me, and the ending was a bomb, I wouldn't recomend anyone to buy this game"
4,This game is fun but to hard in some spaces,"Hello,I have had this game since the Spring 2003. My husband and I been trying to get through it and he is 94 percent done and can't beat mastermind. I am stuck in the sales that you have to bounce to the next sail to get to the other side and then go back and bounce to the other sails. We also had trouble with the all scares upstairs when you have to jump from a bed and onto the candle lamps to get to the other side. if you don't make it then you have to bounce on the bed on the buttom and onto the platform and it bounces back. Another area we have trouble with is the flooded area. if you don't wait until the water brings the boats that sinks up where u jump you get a few blind spots. Other then that the game is Awsome. I hope they made a night of the 100 frights part 2 because its awsome.Is there any pointers that you can give me?"
1,Don't Bother,"I guess the other reviewers of this game who gave it such a high ranking may not have tried to play it all the way through to the end. BEWARE, just over half way through there is a section called ""wreck on the deck"" which will cause anyone but the most die hard game fan to give up and simply throw this game back in the cupboard forever. My kids have given up on it and so have I since this particular jumping section requires nothing short of nanosecond timing. If you don't believe me read the walkthroughs at Gamespot where it took one dedicated gamer over 50 attempts to pass this section. Save yourself the frustration and avoid this game."
3,Great game up to a point and then.....,"I would of given this game 5 stars despitesome of it's flaws, but there's one part of thisgame that is almost impossible to advance through.""Wreck on the Deck, part 2"". Thecreators of this game must have a sadisticstreak in them to put it's customers througha section of their game that has a series ofjumps that will drive you mad. I looked onlinefor some tips to get through this phase andI found out that many gamers either workedextremely hard to get through ""Wreck on theDeck, part 2"", or have simply given up.My daughter gets to this point and starts anew game. She'll never get to the end butstill enjoys playing it over and over.A lot offun and frustration awaits anyone who buysthis game. Too bad it's creators made thegame so hard in this one spot."
1,"fun game was ""wrecked""","I agree with the reviewer that said you would want to give up on the game after the ""wreck on the deck"" impossible jump sequence. Never mind the young kids or the slow adults, my 19 year old and his friends smugly offered to get us through this part, but couldn't do it! Save your money."
1,Save Your Money.,"After purchasing The New American House (Vol 1-3), The New American Cottage, and The New American Swimming Pool which are all excellant books, I ordered The New American Apartment and was severely disappointed.I SENT THE BOOK BACK! (if that gives you any idea of my satisfaction.)There are several interesting photos but unless you have several million dollars, the designs and concepts are so unapproachable to the average person that the book was useless for my needs. This is the same kind of stuff they show in Architectural Digest (as opposed to Fine Homebuilding.)"
4,its a visual feast!!,A must have book for a library collection of inspirational modern design. The Book outlines each architect's space with dramatic and all encompassing views along with drawings to further explain the concepts. It left me wanting more!
5,Long lost Spike Jones tracks surface!,"Harlequin has been releasing hard-to-find Spike Jones items since the 1980s, beginning with the Standard Transcriptions. But this new release, Fonk, is absolutely the best of the litter! Even if you are a rabid Jones collector, you will find a goldmine of long out-of-print discs, previously unheard radio excerpts, interviews, and even several alternate performances from Spike's golden days with RCA Victor. The sound is quite good on all tracks. There is not a ""lemon"" among them!"
3,Flea Free,"I give Flea Free 3 stars mainly because the dog's like it. but as far as the flea's go they sill have them . There has been no improvment on the digging and scratching . I'll continue using until its all gone, I'm almost thru with the bottle now. Who knows maybe it will start working at the last minute. I hope !!! But i've got my doubts"
4,Great Evaluations,Great for Evaluations but kind of repetative language. The book could be alot shorter.
3,Required College Text,"This is a required text for a college class. The book is sort of a bore and I would not have read it except for the class. I have read better college level books on this subject. Like much of education, this book takes common sense and hides it behind complex sounding words and terms thus making the obvious seem complex."
1,Horrible to study - good for those who are already experts,"Jackson is the standard textbook for E&M in gradschool. The problem is, that if one tries to understand the material it is almost impossible withour knowing the stuff already. Too often Jackson assumes some knowledge on the math or physics involved by using phrases like ""as can be shown easily...."" ""as can be proved using...."" etc. I'd rather prefer a text which exlplains the material with less geeky physicists language (only a few authors have actually the ability to do that, but there are a few). The problems are almost impossible to solve using Jacksons text only. In my graduate course one out of ten students actualy works on the problems on a regular basis, the rest gives up quickly or copies the solution from the students of the previous year who themselves copied most of the solutions. So it is time consuming and not very helpful in getting an understanding of the material."
4,Good refrence book but not for learning,"This book has anything you ever wanted to know about physics. The mating habits of electrons with protons or the probability of whatever, it is all here! I find myself amazed of just how much relevant information is in this book. I don't like learning from it because this man skips too many steps. The reader should be able to show, SHOW ... I can't show, if I could show I wouldn't need to learn it! But, seriously, the person who takes the time to actually show how he gets from point A to point E (working out missing steps points B --> D) will be a much better physicists. The only way to learn is by doing!"
3,The Most Pedantic Text in Physics,"This is the most meticulously pedantic text I have ever seen. It is its greatest virtue and its greatest vice. This book is almost perfectly correct and, to the best of my knowledge, has no typos. It covers Classical Electrodynamics more fully than any other text, especially if one pays attention to the problems in the end of each chapter. And all this makes it absolutely impossible to read.I would suggest that one use Purcell. Yes, it is a freshman book. However, it really has everything a physicist will ever need in Electromagnetism. Most importantly, unlike Jackson, it gives physical context to the mathematics. And if one ever needs more, one can use Jackson as a great, invariably correct, reference."
1,The Brightest Physics Students will Avoid this One,"I disagree. Jackson simply presents several topics in an incoherant and slapdash fashion. There's a great deal of material in this book but Jackson doesn't do it justice. The brightest students will save their money and never buy this one. It's overrated and the problems are not difficult, just vaguely worded or occasionally algebraically messy."
1,Worst textbook ever written,"This is without a doubt the absolute worst textbook I have ever used. The material is presented is a random illogical order, as if it were written with the sole purpose to confuse readers.The problems are ridiculous, they are a complete and total wast of time, You do not end up learning anything about how to solve actual problems you are likely to encounter, and you gain absolutely no physical or intuitive insight into electro-magnetics.The only reason this stinking rotting pile of crap is used in American universities is because the professors themselves were forced to use this book.If you want to learn how to solve problems, I suggest a look at Franklin, and to gain real, meaningful physical insight, have a look at Landau and Lifschitz."
1,THIS BOOK IS A DISGRACE TO PHYSICS.,"We used Jackson's ""classic"" in the graduate E&M class. But Jackson doesn't teach. I wound up learning the material from the instructor's handouts and help in office hours.Jackson's book falls below the threshold of being a true textbook. The book does not educate. There are zero worked examples, only bombastic dreck. The sooner this book is replaced by something user-friendly, the better."
3,Dismal but detailed,"This book is indeed pretty awful. I basically agree with the other review that said it seems to be written for the sole purpose of confusing the reader. I found many of the problems to actually be quite easy once one gets past Jackson's atrocious writing and figures out what the question is actually asking. That said, a lot of the problems are simply mathematics, offering no physical insight and doing nothing to develop one's understanding of the subject.If you want to actually learn E&M;, there are much better books such as Vanderlinde. If you want to work through math problems and attempt to parse some of the most terrible writing to ever see the light of day, Jackson may be for you. It also may prove useful if you already know the subject, although even after going through graduate E&M; I still go back to Vanderlinde when I want a comprehensible explanation of something."
2,2 stars for effort and its history,"If you would like to learn some of the mathematics in E&M; this book is nearly perfect. For those wanting to learn physics, Feynman is the appropriate book.For example, consider the following: what is more important to you: learning how to spend time with tensors or learning why the spring model of the dipole is important?Though Jackson is regarded as a classic, if you read Feynman for the physics, and perhaps Griffiths for the problems, you will probably know what you are talking about.In short, Jackson does indeed have interesting discussions on certain topics, but overall this book focuses on terse mathematics rather than physics."
4,Everything you have never dare to ask about electromagnitism,"Like the Born & Wolf, the Jackson is one of those classic title that everyone knows (or fears)! Electrodynamics is a hard topic, and Jackson is a hard book. However, it covers the subject in great details, that's make it a great book. Nowhere else I have been able to find the correct treatement for the diffraction in a converging beam. However, it very difficult to use for a quick search for answer because it covers many topic in great details.The last edition include a welcome charge: the utilisation of the internatinal system of unit."
2,A poorly written learning tool,"As a graduate student who is currently taking a course using Jackson, I can honestly say that it is very poorly written. The primary reason Jackson's text has survived this long is that it has challanging problems, which are an important part of learning e&m. Unfortunately, the actual text is difficult to follow and largely devoid of examples. While I can't comment on many of the contemporary graduate level alternatives to Jackson, I have personally found Griffiths text to be an excellent undergraduate level text which has proven useful in understanding some of the more cryptic parts of Jackson where topics overlap. The only good graduate text I've examined that I think is both at the same advanced level of complexity as Jackson and lucid enough to learn from is Sir James Jeans text, which is unfortunalely out of print and a bit obsolete in its notation. I have found Jeans to be quite helpful when learning some of the more advanced level material covered in Jackson."
3,Well Written for sure,"This book is a scholarly achievment, and a graduate student in physics should definitely study it carefully (I would also recommend electrical engineers read it too). On the other hand its a bit much for a class and the problems are a bit overboard for just teaching the subject to mere mortals. Another good book which is perhaps the best at the ""undergrad"" level is Griffiths electrodynamics book."
4,Excellent book!!,"This book is an excellent book on E&M. Math is a must and knowing it is the key not just ""seeing it before."" Master Griffiths' electrodynamics book, all the math there is to know, and then try Jackson's book. After this book, you'll know everything about classical electrodynamics."
4,classical electrodynamic by John David Jackson,Satisfied but a bit disappointed when the item turned out to be soft cover while the hard cover is presented here. anyway what really matter is the content. Thanks
1,I am very disappointed,I have not received my book until now. My book has gone! I don't know where it is now. I've a claim but I have not received the respond until now! I am very disappointed. I want my money back!
1,feeling cheated,"It seems that the book I bought is cheap. But it is not the orginal version, and paper used for the book is awful bad. As a matter of fact, I paid 5 times the actual price of the book, not ~50 percent!"
3,"Good content, not well written",The content is good for a graduate level physics course but it's not as easily followed as other EM books at the same level. I wouldn't buy it unless you need it for a class.
4,Essential book for the math of electrodynamics,"If you want to understand electrodynamics, don't start with Jackson. The Fynmann lecture series and Landau's series are better places to develop physical intuitions & understanding of the subject.(There are many other worthy books, this are just the first two to come to mind.) However, when you have to solve problems, you will want to have Jackson's book around. When it comes to solving the equations, I have not found its equal. Therefor, I believe it belongs on the shelf of practicing physicsts. Besides, the appendix on SI vs. cgs units is essential for anyone who reads papers from the 'golden age' of physics, which uses formulas that assume cgs units. Jackon may not be the best book to help you set up the 'physics', but is is a great book to help you solve the problems in electrodynaimcs."
2,It is a shame that this text is considered a classic.,"The author fails to communicate the fundementals clearly. He presents a myriad of topics quickly and without consideration for individuals who would like to learn. Possibly, the sheer number of topics covered in this book redeems it a bit, but only in the sense that the book may be used as a reference in a library. Or better yet, it may be used as a footstool so that I can reach higher on the book shelf to obtain a copy of Griffiths to help elucidate this text.One thing is certain, the problems at the end of each chapter are challenging, and that's why I gave the book two stars instead of one."
2,What's the purpose?,"I fail to understand the purpose of writing such a book as Jacksons'. The physics is many times neglected in favor of mathematics, and yet the mathematics itself is poorly explained. It feels like studying E&M while being drunk: ""you take the div of the curl, then the curl of the curl and the div of the div of the . . . "" Also, Jackson takes the rather uninspiring view of teaching E&M from the unrelativistic point of view, a real shame, considering the conceptual simplification such an approach offers. Classical Electrodynamics by Julian Schwinger outrivals Jackson's book from the mathematical point of view, and is more comprehensive. Schwartz's ""Principles of Electrodynamics"" and Ohanian's text (forgot the name) explain the physics much better (Ohanian's book is also at a nice mathematical level). So what's the purpose of using this text?"
4,advanced and difficult to read,you gonna need to have certain background before you can understand what is going on in this book.
3,Great Reference Guide,"Jackson is not a book you just buy for some light reading. It is a very difficult book to understand, unless you already know a lot about E&M. I would not recommend this book unless required for a course or if you are already an expert at E&M then it would be a great reference book."
1,The emperor is naked,This is terrible textbook. Jackson has no idea how to present material so that you can use it to solve real world problems. He should be covered in sackcloth and ashes.Dr Val
4,"Excellent DVD about a German businessman who protected more than 200,000 Chinese during the Nanking Massacre in China","There's a lot to like about this DVD: Good true story; excellent acting; authentic settings and costuming; and well-paced narrative. Its story is reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List""."
3,John Rabe,"Like the book, has plenty of detail for research.I am always amazed by the sheer violance people can do to each other.I was also amazed at the history of Nanking."
2,Not Great,"I'm going to say something that might sound odd: this is not a leadership book. It deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of Churchill's style, but strangely not his ""executive success in the face of adversity."" And Hayward's assertion that Churchill's style is like that of an executive seems a little red-faced: Hayward spends a lot of time defending against Churchill's critics that Churchill was disorganized and a bad judge of character. In all likelihood, he is forcing Churchill into a category that he does not belong: indeed, Churchill may have been disorganized, but he was a darn good prime minister. My opinion is that Churchill deserves more than this. In place of this book, I would recommend Lincoln On Leadership."
4,"Inspirational & instructive, but not in the way intended","Churchill's leadership and perseverance carry this book. The lessons mentioned at the end of each chapter seem trivial - as if summing up Churchills achievements can be encapsulated in a few managerial maxims. What Mr Hayward has achieved is to display a man very much like us (women included). I learned his eloquence was not a gift but the result of hard work (I too can work on my short-comings); he had many failures, some fatal for a politician, but continued to soldier on (I too can persevere); he stuck with his own sense of self-worth when every one else proclaimed him as finished (I too can maintain confidence against adversity). The maxims, Mr Hayward, are not needed. But thank you for bringing such a powerful figure down to earth, where we can all learn from his extraordinary life."
2,"Entertaining, but not that useful for aspiring leaders","I am a Churchill buff, and REALLY wanted to like this book. I did enjoy many of the anecdotes and situations discussed. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that the book offered much useful advice to those who want to lead. The author offers brief bullet points at the end of each chapter that summarize key lessons, but most of them are fairly self-evident, and they are not well-developed.This type of book seems to be popular lately. People looking for historical lessons based on real figures would do better to read ""Lincoln on Leadership"" or the old Attila the Hun books by Wess Roberts"
2,"Another biography, but a different style.","As a longtime fan of Churchill, and in a position of leadership in a commercial environment, the book appeared to be excellant vacation reading. Well it was but only from the 'fan' position. The author sets out with good intentions and early in the book he relates Churchill ways back into the context of today's executive's environment. But, by the middle, and then thereafter, he's lost his way and it becomes a bit idol worshipping with no real relevance to application to today's leadership 'student'. At times Mr Hayward really is squeezing the pips to show Winston as a model to follow - I've suggested dictation from my bathtub but so far my secretary hasn't picked up on the idea. If you want to understand Churchill it's a good read. If it's leadership you want you'll have to browse further."
4,worth your time and money,"The book is well written, entertaining, and to the point. I felt like I've learned something after reading the book and that's all the importance. The book doesn't get into too much details as some readers would like, but it serves its purpose as an easy-to-read book. As Churchill himself observed that leadership is pretty much inborn and can hardly be learned, the book doesn't offer you the definate way to leadership, or even as of how Churchill could be a great leader as he was. The book, however, offers you the general descriptions of the man and the elements of making a leader. It tells you ""what"", not ""how"". The point is -- you might pick up something useful for yourself from the book and that's all that matters."
2,"Good model, wrong brand","If you are used to pricier Panasonic phones, cheaper quality phones such as this ATT can be tempting for they offer a lot for your money...that is if they work.Here are some problems:The stored number function is cumbersome to use specially if you a pin driven carrier or if you have more than 5 numbers to store.The remote unit resets by itself everytime there is static charge ( very hard to avoid during winter)on contact.The number keys are too small and too close.A person with a larger than average hand will have a hard time with these keys.In sum, in order to get all these features at a lower price the old ""lower quality lower price"" formula is used."
1,Do not buy.,"This watch broke within two weeks of wearing it. The clips are flimsy and the best way to put it would be to say this watch was ""economically"" built."
4,Xmas Present,Nice watch! My husband uses on job site. He breaks all other wrist watches! So it works great for his use.
2,"good watch, good concept, crappy snaps","It is only ""OK"". The watch part is fine but the snaps were so tight that one of them finally pulled out through the leather. I really like the idea and layout of this thing so I'm going to try and fix it, but be warned that you'd better make sure it snaps and UNsnaps easily before using it a lot."
4,"Great Info, Bad format","I'd give this five stars but the format was very hard to follow. I want to pat Bastford on the head and kick them in the butt at the same time. A pat on the head for the Psakhis books and a kick in the butt for the format of info. Take a hint and just copy Gambit's format. The info itself is coming from one of the most knowledgeable french aficionados outside of Korchnoi and Bareev in my book. His evaluations are spot on, it's a must buy, just be prepared to jump around a bit."
4,Excellent book,"This book is an excellent review about the most positional lines in this lovely defence. Psakhis made a good complement for other great book like French Defence by Watson, but with an approach more dry and positional."
1,Buy the updated version,"I recently made the mistake of buying this edition. The reviews are totally outdated. Also, Frommers is not good about giving specific addresses of attractions, etc. They give intersections and cross streets instead of the actual address, which is not the most convenient option if you are using a GPS."
3,"Fun, but not enough Brian Dennehy or Mike Farrell","For a movie about naked, corrupt greed that by rights should make you angry, ""The Crooked E"" is still fun because it won't let you forget it's a formulaic, cheesy TV movie. It's billed as starring Brian Dennehy, but he's really a peripheral character who shows up less than half a dozen times as a mentor of sorts for the main character, a fresh-faced, newly hired Enron underling. Dennehy elevates the movie every time he shows up, though. Because the movie revolves around the underling's ups and downs, Mike Farrell as Ken Lay is also mostly wasted in a largely two-dimensional role, giving pep talks to the troops about the stock even as he was dumping it.If you go in understanding that this movie isn't about Brian Dennehy's or Mike Farrell's characters, and is rather cliched in its moralizing, you'll have a good time."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"I had no idea what the deal was with Enron and now I know a little more through the eyes of a man who was employed during it's final months. The acting is excellent, the story is well told."
3,Acceptable,It's a shame that this movie doesn't have spanish subtitles. It is a very accurate history and the drama is ok.
1,The REAL truth about ENRON is NOT in this movie,"Since I began working at the company later known as ENRON before Ken Lay was working there and I was in the next room in 1985 when he got his job, then I feel well qualified to say that the ONLY part of this movie that is accurate is the term...SHREDDED and that is what you should do with this movie. Shred it. It does in NO WAY come close to tell the story of Enron. It is regretable that some of the good actors hired to portray this movie and now associated with this shameful attempt to tell the story of the greatest corporate crime in the history of mankind. The total loss due to the criminal actions of the executives of ENRON surpassed SIXTY-EIGHT BILLION dollar costing 24,000 people their jobs AND their life savings."
2,Aspires to Greatness,"Plays with the story line in a book in attempt at epic greatness, but falls short. The executives in this movie are extremely unconvincing, when compared to footage of the real people."
3,Aaron Baker Cole Is Right On,"I would simply like to echo the 3-star review provided by Aaron Baker Cole. ""The Resurrection"" certainly deserves remastering, but I suppose some gratitude is due to the person/party who took the trouble to transfer a minimally adequate print and make it available to the dvd-buying public."
3,Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler,"I was so pleased to find the Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler on disk. It's a great story and well performed by all. I would have given the product a better rating, but it deserved remastering and never received it. This old project rendition suffers as a result. While the companion stories haven't received rave reviews, I found them insightful and charming, much in the mold of Twilight Zone projects."
5,This CD by Ebba Forsberg was a PLEASANT surprise!,"My husband surprised me with this CD the week it was released... it hasn't left the CD carousel yet! Ebba has a beautiful voice. There's also a great mixture of piano and guitar throughout. The lyrics have a down to Earth honesty. A nice addition to my collection. I rate Ebba right up there with some of my other favorite singers... Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant and Paula Cole."
1,Beware the stars/price differential .................,"When you see the price of this CD and then look at the reviews, you have to wonder. And when you listen to it you'll know that if there are lots of copies for sale you should always trust the price."
3,"Lovely voice, but insipid songs","There's a very eloquent reviewer going by the nom de plume of John Wayne who bemoans the fact that this Dido soundalike has not achieved the fame of her auditory doppleganger. Well, I think that there's a good reason for that. While Forsberg has an undeniably lovely voice (a sort of Rita Coolidge-Dido hybrid), her songs are silly, insipid, and dull. While somebody else wrote most of her lyrics, apparently Forsberg wrote the music, and that too is nothing special. Not a hook to be found anywhere, although nothing is outstanding bad. I am quite surprised at the reviewers comparing her to Paula Cole and Natalie Merchant, both of whom are dazzling songwriters. While Forsberg certainly is enjoyable to listen to, she's not what I'd call the complete package. I suspect this talented woman was undone by her poor material, and that's a shame, because I do agree that she deserves better."
1,Bring back the old buttoneer,They ruined it. It was a nifty product and something that worked really great. These new fasteners are horrible. I bought one to give to my daughter who was going away to college. My mom gave me one that is 32 years old now when I went away to college. I use that so many times. I thought it would help her. Not so.
1,Pathetic junk,"Really thought I was going to get a good thing, especially for attaching my suspender buttons. What a piece of junk. So far using a entire pack of clips I managed 4 buttons and not sure how long they will remain attached. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH. You can actually attach a button faster doing it the tried and true way -- needle and thread.. I give it one star and that is a stretch."
1,it realy doesn't work,I tried this on several shirts and it just didn't work. It may work with very thin buttons and thin cloth. This was a total waste of my money.
1,An experience in futility,What a waste of money. I went through almost all the plastic attachers without any success until I just threw this in the trash. What a rip off. I could have sewn on 20 buttons in the time I spent trying to get this to work.
2,The Vinage Buttoneer has much more sturdy fasteners,"I don't know why they call this the Original Buttoneer? This is not the original or Vintage version with just one needle. I found the Vintage Buttoneer (the one with only one needle)to have much more sturdy fasteners. If you have the Vintage version or are able to find it, the old fasteners in the box are too old and brittle. I was given the address to order the original fasteners (in new condition)Buttoneer FastenersP.O. Box 557Franklin, MA 02038You have to write them and request information, there is no website, or phone number available. I hope this helps some of you."
2,buttoneer,"this is not your old buttoneer this has thin small fastners that do not hold buttones on you can not buy heavier fastners, the old buttoneers you could put a button on a coat not this one, it doesn't hold a button on double cotton fabic sorry i brought this is NOT the original"
1,A pathetic imitation of the Buttoneer,"I bought the Original Buttoneer while in the Marines in 1972. It was awesome; no button fastened by it came off, ever. It was useful for fastening other things as well. So I bought this product in the hope that I could recpature the ease of use and reliability of the original. No such luck. This ""Original Buttoneer"" is useless. The brads are too short, too brittle, and the device is cheaply made and difficult to work. A total waste of money.it would take nothing for someone to re-create the original, change the name, and sell them here.S.J. Britt USMCR(ret.)"
1,Buttoneer = Waste of Money,"In my opinion, the Buttoneer is a waste of money. It is easy to use and I fastened some buttons on with it, but the plastic tabs that fasten the buttons on is brittle and broke off the first time I undid the button. I refastened the button with several Buttoneer plastic tabs to make it stronger, and it still broke off the first time I used the button.Nothing beats old-fashioned thread and a needle."
1,This is a P.O.S -don't waste your $,Only works on very thin shirts and doesn't hold buttons well -buttons usually fall off by the second wearing. Plus one of the two needles on it broke on the third use. Best sounding/worst product EVER! Don't get suckered.
1,"looked good, didn't work so well",I bought the buttoneer. This product did not work for me. In fact it was much easier to just sew the button back on which it what i had to do any way.
1,Don't buy this product.,This a total piece of junk. I used it on three pieces of clothing and NONE of the buttons held long enough to actually use the clothing item. It says made in China but I don't think it is that good. Al Capp's Lower Slobovia would be more apt.
1,"Buttoneer disappointment, part 2","I received my Buttoneer a month ago and was quite disappointed at the flimsiness of it. However, I have been using it to attach buttons to bags as decorations. No problem; I even ran out of attachments and ordered 100 more. Tonight one of the needles broke off the instrument. I am very disappointed and quite upset that this piece of equipment didn't last more than a month. I am going to request a replacement and hope the company will honor it. Things sure aren't made the way they used to be! If I do received new Buttoneer, I will only use tiny buttons.Beth Googins"
1,Bad Duplicate of Great Item - Not Original!,"My parents HAD the original buttoneer - it had one needle/prong, not two like this one and others I have seen lately... Its original sales pitch was that it can attach single holed buttons... The plastic fasteners were much longer/larger and stayed put... These tiny ones are a joke, if they stay for a single wear/use of the garmet they will not last for a second use or washing... The original was so tough my 13yr old hand could not pull the button off when I tried! Trust me, this is NOT the original... perhaps its the original 'inproved' edition... but not the first. Dont buy it - I wasted my $$!"
1,Learn to sew on a button!,"Save your money. Even if you can get the button on with this, takes practice,they will not stay on. After 3 times on the same button, yes I found it 3 times,I gave up!"
1,the little feet on the fasteners break off?,i have owned the buttoneer for 15 years or more. in the old days the fasteners were it appears to be made of nylon and stretched when used. the fasteners now appear to be made of plastic and when used in the buttoneer the little feet at the ends of the fasteners break off and therefore the fastener does not hold the button onto the the shirt or whatever you are trying to attach the button to. you can test this yourself by removing one of the two fasteners from the clip holding the fasteners. then hold the end of the fastener (the foot) with your finger and thumb and pull on the other end of the fastener trying to stretch it out somewhat. immediately the little foot pops off (breaks off) making the fastener useless. i think the buttoneer is still a good product but the fasteners seem to be of little use since the little feet at the ends of the fasteners break off which obviously makes the buttoneer useless.
3,yep not as good,"sure not like the original, I can remember being ableto use the original on heavy blue jeans.. this one willbarely go through a pair a pants.. I suppose it's goodfor shirts buttons. what a shame to make once was sucha great product, poorly now.. I'd be willing to pay MOREto have them make them like they were !I did get it to do ONE button by pressing one both sides of thematerial to get the prongs through, shouldn't be a JOB !"
3,Not fantastic but will do,"This is the second Buttoneer that I've owned. It works better than the first one I bought, but still has problems. The plastic fasteners have a tendency to break when being inserted. This device breaks about one in four of them, which is kind of frustrating. Since the two buttoneers are identical for all I can see, one could expect that performance of another would be somewhere between these two. The fasteners don't last as long as I would hope. I haven't kept records, so I couldn't tell you how long."
1,Buttoneer = Waste of Money,"In my opinion, the Buttoneer is a waste of money. It is easy to use, but the plastic tabs that fasten the buttons are brittle and all the ones I used broke the first time I used the button.I tried reinforcing some buttons with several Buttoneer plastic tabs to make it stronger, but the buttons still broke off the first or second time they were used.Nothing beats the old-fashioned needle and thread for getting a button back on."
1,Do not waste your money,"I used the Buttoneer one time and the needle that pushed the fastner through broke. Once this happens, the Buttoneer is useless. There is also no warranty.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1,Very disappointed!,"I have several dresses that button all the way down the front. I have trouble with the thread that holds the buttons at the waist area being worn away by my desk and my seat belt. I hate sewing on buttons over and over again. I remembered that my mother had a buttoneer when I was a child, so when I found it on Amazon I was really excited! I tried it as soon as it came, but to my GREAT disappointment, it doesn't work on my dresses. The skinny little plastic holders are not long enough to go through the button and the material. The plastic is so thin that, even if it did go through, I don't think it would last very long. I was really bummed out. Unless you are using very small buttons and very thin material you will not be happy with this product."
1,Not the original buttoneer,"I owned an original years ago when it first came out. It was heavier, more durable, easier to load, and the bullet was similar to a tag holder on one side and a small nitro pill size finish for the front. I gotta tell you I am so disapointed in this one. If it was to be used on a tee shirt, yes pretty easy. I had the bottom part of my hooded sweat zipper de threading. I did get it on. Looks better than the old ties but I thought it would break through the whole 1/2 hour it took me to get through it. Plus the waste of those ties especially without a spring to make the push handle come back was terrible."
1,Not a good gadget,it doesn't hold up no lasting value. repair to visible not really a quick fix. Needs to be updated to modern times
1,Save your money,Doesn't work very well at all. After much fiddling got one button attached but it popped of at first wearing.
4,Works pretty well-but isnt the 'original',"The original Butoneer actually attached buttons so they wouldnt come off. The new Butonner doesnt seem to do as well. It appears the problem is not in the design of the unit itself but in the fasteners-which seem to be shorter and attach less securely. Still, it's great for emergency 'fixes'."
1,Not great!,"I had an original buttoneer years ago and loved it, but this is nothing like the one I had. It does not work well at all, and is cheap and flimsy. Would not recommend."
4,It's good,"It's a little hard to insert the fasteners into the needles's channels and you have to hold tightly the fabric to keep them and the buttons in place. Beyond that, it's a good product because it makes the work a little faster."
2,"Not the answer, but a start.","The buttoneer is easy to use once you get the hang of loading the fasteners and if you don't have time to thread a needle it's an ok substitute. However, it doesn't work on thick buttons, it doesn't work on thick material, it doesn't work on big shank buttons, etc, etc. Also, it doesn't deploy any kind of catch on the back of the material so the buttons can come back off easily. With the way price tags are attached to clothing today, it seems to me someone could take the buttoneer to the next level and buttons would never come off again."
2,Hit and miss,"Not so great, IMO. The fasteners don't get inserted most of the time, and when they do, sometimes it's only one of the two heads that makes a successful connection. I finally tossed it."
5,Original Buttoneer Fastoning System,The productuct performs as I expected. It allows me to replace buttons on my shirts. I feel that it gives me a degree of independance as I can now replace buttons when needed rather than waiting for someone else to sew one on for me.
1,Original 'Junkaneer',"What a piece of junk! this thing totally did NOT work. after maybe fiddling around with it for 1/2 hour, you get one button installed and then put that button to work...then check the floor, cuz that's where the button ends up. I just threw it out, couldn't even be bothered to return. By the way, NO reflection on Amazon!! Still love them guys!!!"
2,Handy Tool but Doesn't Hold Up,The Buttoneer worked to attach small plastic rings to fabric but after 50 rings were attached the tool stopped working. Every fastener was fastened at only one side. The Buttoneer is very lightweight and doesn't feel like a quality tool. I purchased 300 refills so overall this was a waste of money and time.
2,Not sturdy enough for winter coats,I was hoping to use the buttoneer to fasten buttons onto one of my wool coats. It couldn't do it. I think it will be useful though for lightweight fabrics like cotton.
1,Not the 'real' Original,"I had the 'real' original buttoneer from the 70's and I loved it and it worked great. Eventually I could not get refills so I purchased the 'new' original buttoneer and I threw it away, it did not work very well at all as the plastic refills were so flimsy they broke. I want the 'real' original buttoneer!"
2,As Seen on TV - but not reality,"I remember seeing this product advertised on TV years ago. But back then, I had a Mom who sewed my buttons, or made me do it myself - which was good learning for this then teenage boy.As a busy professional however, I had too many shirts hanging in my closet with one missing button. Finally, I got online and found this product. It does attach buttons relatively easily, but I have two complaints.1. The button attachment is extremely fragile. This will not work on buttons that have any tension on them.2. It took a bit to figure out and I probably could have sewed the buttons on in about the same length of time.Other than that, it is great!! ;)"
2,"Works ok on Shirts, NOT at all for pants","I bought this primarily for a few pairs of pants with missing buttons, and the fasteners are just too short to go through the thick pant material, even when I just try to get it to go through the first layer, i could only ever get one side of the fastener through, so useless, I did try it on a shirt button and it worked, so its OK for that, but useless for pants unless they come out with a longer fastener for pants."
1,A piece of junk Does not work. I'd like to get my money back,Years ago my mother had a buttoneer that worked beautifully. This one is cheaply made and does not work. I am so disappointed. What a rip off!! Save your money and don't order this piece of junk!!!!
4,"Love, Death and a choice. As simple as great.",Is it as simple as a princess in love being able to save the life of her beloved? You read it once and it sounds as a tale for kids. You read it twice and you can understand there's a circle that never ends. The lady or the tiger? or What would you choose when the choice is love or death?
5,Lassie is good but Duraluxe is better!!!,"I skipped past the Lassie Foundation straight to Duraluxe. It's not that LF isn't good, the songs are great pop tunes...but Duraluxe rocks! All of the Duraluxe tracks are pop rock gems of greatness..."
5,Takes young readers on an exciting adventure,"In The Little Toy Soldier On The Covered Bridge: A Christmas Encounter In The Miniature New England Village Of Duxbury, author Coolidge Wilson takes his young readers on an exciting adventure in a tale of three young children, a toy solider, and a toy dog who are all transported to the miniature village of Duxbury Sea Town. There they search for a lost boy and encounter a host of unusual and memorable characters along the way. The Little Toy Soldier On The Covered Bridge is a welcome and highly recommended addition to the growing library of classic Christmas literature with its underlying message that grace and faith live within us all -- and sometimes revealing itself in rusted tin toys and floppy-eared dogs!"
1,Terrible quality,The sound track was off and was very annoying. Very poor quality. I would not purchase again. If it wasn't a hassle I would return this.
3,"Very funny comedy parody ala the ""Airplane"" movies","If movies like Airplane and the Naked Gun are your taste, Top Secret is a must see. It is as funny and contains as many outrageous site gags as the original Airplane."
5,Best Movie Ever,"This film is Val Kilmer's best work by far. Not only does he show off his talent as a vocalist, but this is his most believable role in any movie I have ever seen him in. Fans will enjoy possibly the greatest backwards scene ever made and the non-stop comedy. Definitely on my top five movies list."
5,Will be never a movie like this,"Is the best movie that i have ever seen, even better than pulp fiction. No more words... everithing is perfect in this movie, incredible!"
4,Top Secret- Airplane-style cliches at thier finest,"This is the madcap Zucker Bros. at their best ( or worst as you may see it). The film is ""tongue-in-cheek"" from start to finish. A bit dated (as the plot calls for a plan to reunite Germany), but the sight gags and puns are non-stop, not to mention Val Kilmer's rendition of Elvis/James Brown onstage antics and music and a hilarious version of ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" View it seven times and you will discover you missed things each time that you were laughing and skipped overbefore. It isn't for the ""normal"" viewer,...your sense of humor must be skewed to the off-beat satirical side. However, if you liked Police Squad and Hot Shots this non-stop insanity will light you up...!"
4,"Cheesy Gem from the Makers of ""Airplane!""","For those who enjoyed the ""Airplane!"" and ""Naked Gun"" films, ""Top Secret!"" might be considered the ultimate silly farce. For those who can put their brains and their maturity on hold for a couple hours, this film just might kill you with laughter."
4,Overlooked comedy,"I saw this movie as a teenager in the 80's with my friends. What a blast! Val Kilmer is truly hilarious. He should do more comedy. If you like movies like Airplane! and Hot Shots! you'll enjoy this one too. There are a lot sight gags in this movie.The jokes are older, like from the 40's, so I'm not sure it matters what age watches it. If you've had any kind of history lessons, the jokes and gags will be funny."
5,Brillante,"Aun me rio cuando la veo, brillante, Val Kilmer destacaI still laugh when I see the movie, Val Kilmer is really amazing in this movie"
5,Set the standard for movie spoofs!,"The best genre spoof of all time! The jokes and sight gags are even funnier and more clever than the ones in ""Airplane"" (the bookshop scene, the underwater saloon barfight, etc.)..."
4,"Fun, funny,.....","I give this 4.5 out of 5. I have always liked this comedy. If you like airplane you'll like this more. These guys poke fun at everything, even car mfg. Ford pinto go boom!!!!!. It's a keeper if you buy it. Good to keep around if nothing else catches your interest."
3,I think this movie is the funniest of all spoof movies.,Val Kilmer as Nick Rivers does a great job as Elvis like preformer trying to prevent the East German stongmen from producing the ultimate nuclear weapon.
3,Val!,"This is a fun movie...early Val Kilmer. I find it good because you get to see ""How Silly Can He Get, Oooh Yeah""."
5,Top Secret,"This little gem of a comedy was passed over by most critics but I find it hilarious. In the vein of Airplane, it pokes fun at war and spy movies. if you want to laugh at silly things, site gags and sharp dialogue, and a fun night for the family, buy it.Top Secret!"
4,A very nice classic comedy,"The movie is very nice. I have actually watch this movie more than 10 over years ago. But recently after I bought this DVD, it amuse me again. I like Val Kilmer in this show, he's damn cool."
2,A dollar short and a day late,"There a a few okay gags, but just okay, and the pace was too slow. Certainly nowhere near as good as Airplane, and if that's a 5-star, this one, by comparison is lucky to get 2 stars. Well, even the Zuckers/Abrahams combo can have an off day. I kinda liked the cow though. One star was for the cow."
2,WWII Spy Spoof -,"""Top Secret's"" directing team made this movie after first creating ""Airplane."" Not hard to realize that since ""Airplane"" became a classic still shown today, and ""Top Secret"" was forgotten long ago, that ""Top Secret"" doesn't measure up. The star (Val Kilmer) plays an Elvis Presley role in this movie, and the rest of the roles and star names are so forgettable that I've already forgotten what and who they were. The 'good news' about this film is that it is only 90 minutes long."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I loved the Naked Gun Trilogy, and Airplane had many funny moments .... but DO NOT BUY ""Top Secret"" without renting it through Netflix or Blockbuster, or heck, I'll give you my copy! This movie is soooooooo much slower-paced than the others mentioned earlier that I was literally nodding off at 10:00 PM! The gags were so weak that we actually found ourselves saying ... ""Oh, there was a funny one"". Unfortunately, that only happened about once every 15 minutes. How sad. If a movie is truly funny you don't sit there thinking back and saying when was the last time I laughed during this. Even at $6.99, I feel like I wasted my money. Learn from our mistake and save 90 minutes of your life (you'll thank us later)!!!"
3,Not a good description of East Germany.,I thought this was a very funny movie. It had a lot of great sight gags. I just don't like the way they make East Germany look. The East Germany in this movie resembles Nazi Germany which is unfair because the East Germans had a strong anti Nazi line.
2,They should have kept the script TOP SECRET!,"As a lover of the Naked Guns, Hot Shots, and the like, I picked up this item hoping I would have little drops of urine trickle down my pant leg from laughing to hard. Instead, vomit trickled all over my chest from this movie making me sick.Val Kilmer is really good at humiliating himself in this movie. I feel embarreesed for him just watching him dance around like a gay Elvis. The movie only made me laugh once, because the jokes are not that good. If you want a good time call Leslie Neilson. He will always help you out when you need to chuckle.Final Review ********* -2,341 RamRods"
5,THIS MOVIE HAS TO REACH DVD FORMAT !!!,"THis movie deserves to be edited on DVD, lots of people wants this movie ( included me ) on their private collection.Is a must have and an excellent gift. Pleas make this vhs go digital!!! THanks..."
4,If you liked Airplane! you'll love Top Secret!,"I've been a fan of the ZAZ team for as long as I can remember. And this is one of their classic films- Top Secret! spoofs both Elvis musicals and doubleya-doubleya two films- and does it really well. There's sight gags, background gags, puns, a scene shot entirely in reverse, an underwater saloon fight, what else do you want in a movie? I've watched Top Secret! on a regular basis for 15 years, whether it's the version I taped off of TV or the DVD, and am still not bored with it. I always find some new gag that somehow escaped me in previous viewings. While Top Secret! isn't as well known as Airplane!, it's just as hilarious. Watching it with the commentary is not advised- it's quite possibly the worst commentary track I've come across and it's mostly just a bunch of guys laughing. A note- the ""alternate scenes"" featured in the DVD were re-inserted for the TV version of the movie."
3,presupposes strong background in continuous group theory,"The title says ""physicists"". This book was one of my physics texts. Yet I found much of this to be incomprehensible. Some sections are indeed very clear and descriptive. But much of it assumed an extensive prior knowledge of continuous groups, and how these are typically used in high energy physics.I was a physics/maths major, with a strong background in maths. Now perhaps my difficulties with this book were due to my lack of background. Yet of all my texts, this was the only one that I was never comfortable with."
5,Hernando de Soto,"This is a novel based on Hernando de Soto's Sixteenth Century expedition through what is known as the Southern states (US) in search of gold and a passage to China.Hernando de Soto (Jerez de los Caballeros, Badajoz, Spain, c.1496/1497[1]-May 21, 1542) was a Spanish explorer and conquistador who, while leading the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day United States, was the first European to discover the Mississippi River. The exact course of de Soto's expedition is subject to discussions and controversy among historians and local politicians.1539 to early-1540 in Florida1540 - Through Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi1541 - To the west through Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas.De Soto died of a fever on May 21, 1542, in the Indian village of Guachoya (near present-day McArthur, Arkansas)on the western banks of the Mississippi."
3,Worm's Blast,"Worm's Blast is already out for computer and when I purchased it I expected an newer version of Worms World Party, or Worms Armageddon but it is an entirely different game. Worm's Blast is more of a puzzle game similar to BustAMove, and tetris. You must match the colors of the bricks up while being a selected Worm Character. Not my favorite game but that is just becuase it is not Wormish.!"
2,I wished i had check the reviews before buying the Game,"When I first played Worms Armageddon on Nintendo 64 I was addicted. That game brought endless hours of Multiplayer Mayhem. So naturally when i heard that a game called Worms Blast was out for Gamecube I bought it immediately. . . WITHOUT CHECKING THE REVIEWS. Man what a waste of money. This is not worms people. Its a game called, ""bust a move"" with worms as the main characters. I would not recommend any gamers to acually buy this game especially true Worms gamers. My opinion is that its not even worth a rental. (but you can be the judge of that). Just go download Bust-a-move for free and save your money for a real game."
2,Want to Measure your frustration level? This game is it!,"The Worms Blast game start off fun, but gets progressively harder. Sometimes, you can't even beat the level. But this game is bad, because some levels are quite impossible. That's all."
2,Bring Back World Party and Armageddon,"I got to thinking, why not just release another graphically enhanced version of either Worms World Party or Armageddon. The classic characteristics of those two are being sacrificed just to be replaced by graphics and a plot more related to a puzzle, then attrition."
5,"Superbly cratfed, in HBO's finest style!","Like most people, I am trying to lose a few pounds and found this documentary very helpful and supportive. I will be purchasing the DVD collection, since HBO has made it easy to afford and I understand it has a number of bonus features."
5,MissD,"informative, easy to understand the difference between processed food and real foods.will apply the knowledge as a life changing challenge.foods are real medicine for the operation and function of the body along with a simple activity of walking.all movement and fun activity is good for the body:learning to dance, swim, lift weights, sprinting, baseball, basketball,pingpong, tennis,the list of activities that move the body are endless."
5,Best Objective/Scientific Nutrition and Weight Documentary,"I'm a Registered Dietitian and have seen almost every major Documentary on the market for nutrition. This one is the BEST based on the fact it is science based and not opinion based (as so many are). It doesn't try to persuade you to become vegan, vegetarian, or an extremist in the realm of nutrition but gives you the straight forward facts, and what you chose to do with that information is up to you!"
2,It's NOT all about food,"Being overwieght minus medical conditions IS possibleBeing Obese does not mean you Are unhealthy, just as being thin makes you healthy. There are way too many Additives And preservatives and chemicals in the food supply which contribute to the medical conditions. Once we take all the flavorings, ""spices"" etc out of Food, well be ok. Diet food is loaded With chemicals to make Them Taste better. Obesity is NOT the issue. Its the FDA."
5,The most important health issue at hand,A Chef I was working with recommended that I watch this video. I watched every section and was inspired to lose weight. 40 pounds lost and counting. This would be required watching for every parent.
2,What could Pletnev have been thinking?,"No one would disagree that Pletnev has both technique and ideas, but in this recording I'm afraid he is not only idiosyncratic, but willful and egotistical. He pushes and pulls the rhythmic pulse and seems almost to be rewriting the scores in question; indeed he scrambles the order of the Variations and drops Variation VIII. This, plus the odd overuse of pedal that smears harmonies and individual lines, and you have a self-indulgent recital that certainly will not appeal to those of who consider this music some of Schumann's best. There are some elegant and poetic moments, but they cannot rescue this mostly awful set of performances."
5,"Good 'Ole Honky Tonkin, Beer Drinkin, Cheatin Country","I just got into old 60's and 70's country the past few years and was looking for something new to listen to as my old waylon, willie, cash, haggard and george jones records are about worn out. I started searching around and came upon Moe Bandy. Some of the song titles looked interesting so I bought this 'double' cd and gave it a few spins. the first song (and title track) was instantly one of my new favorite songs. with a line like ""...i just found out my woman is the devil...,"" how can you go wrong. these are mostly old tear in the beer cheatin songs, but Bandy's voice makes them sound a little more whiskey soaked than the average 'country' singer. Bandy also has some amazing lyrics, which is very important to a good country song. i recommend this to anyone that likes good old fashioned country...kenny chesney fans need not apply."
4,I LOVE THIS WEST COAST TOAST,"Bud Shank was on of my earlier heores. Conti Candoli and those west coast guys were playing great Jazz. However, traditionalist always frown on those ""CATS"", especially in the 50's & 60's. But remember this, DOLPHY, DEXTER, MULLIGAN, & CHET BAKER all came out of the west. Bud Shank is outstanding here, and yet he doesn't hog the show !"
1,"Kindle edition is illegible, worthless","I assume the positive reviews here are for the print edition. The Kindle edition is essentially a series of gray on gray, illegible raster images. The only way to read it is to zoom in on each page and painfully try to move about and decipher small portions of the image one at a time. I would like my money back, but there seems to be no way to get a refund for a Kindle book after seven days. Ten bucks wasted."
1,Poor Quality Kindle Version,This was a complete dissapointment would like to get my money back. The kindle text can not be read pictures are only black and white. Not at all like the sample you can review on line. I hear this book is good but don't get the kindle version.
2,"Lots of fluff, not much meat","The first half of the this book (200 pages) explains what the registry is and how to change the settings. The next 150 pages give some detail, but misses some very important registery keys. No where in this book does it explain how to turn off autoplay on the CD-ROM."
4,What Every Daughter Should Know About Her Mother,"This is a wonderful keepsake for your daughter. This book guides Mothers in writing a manuscript about themselves to pass along to their daughters. Each page is colorful with drawings and illustrations appropriate to each particular subject. Also, each page is lined so that you can write your story right in the book. An example of a subject is: ""How I Met Your Father""; ""What You Were Like As A Teenager"". I am enjoying writing about myself to my daughter. Mother Remembers, for My Daughter makes is very easy to write your story because it takes the guess work out of writing. At the top of each page is a lead in line, and you simply complete the thought. Very thoughtful gift."
3,A Romance Junkie,"Dante was on his way home and called his home, his brother answered the phone and told him his wife was having sex with another man, and she was drunk, and their son was crying in another room. Dante our super rich alpha male, got home saw the condition of his wife and took off to Italy with his son. I never really warmed up to Dante, he was kind of a jerk. Miranda his beautiful wife could barely get up, and he was violently sick but Dante saw two glasses and the bottle of booze and assumed his brother was telling the truth. What a block head!! Miranda was annoyingly in love with this guy. He talked her into coming to Italy because his son was missing her, and it would have been a really good story if Dante was not such a jerk and the story had some conflict between the two. I gave it three stars because it did have a good ending."
4,COLORFUL WITH RHYMING TEXT,"Just a glance at the title tells you this is going to be a fun book.....and it is. Colorful, outrageous illustrations by the imaginative John Gabriel joyfully partner with the rhyming text.There is a fellow, a music lover who suffers from severe shyness. He has gone to hear a duet by a cello and a viola when suddenly he feels an irresistible urge to swallow the cello - and he does. Preposterous? Not in the mind of Barbara S. Garriel.Think what swallowing a cello would do to a person's figure let alone his or her digestive tract. You'll have to see these wacky illustrations to get an idea. Now, as if swallowing a cello weren't enough this timid soul follows that feat by ingesting a harp, a sax, a fiddle, a cymbal, a kazoo, and a bell. The fellow has become a veritable one man band.Obviously, no one can spend the rest of his life with these instruments inside. What's the solution?The answer is a very funny surprise.- Gail Cooke"
3,A silly book for teaching instruments.,"I use this book in my preschool music class, and my children really like it. It's definitely not my favorite book for teaching instrument names, but it always makes the kids giggle. The specific instruments that the shy fellow ""swallows"" are kinda random... cello, saxophone, harp, kazoo? It also doesn't make sense to me that the book says things like ""He swallowed the cymbal to jam with the harp."" How in the world does a cymbal jam with a harp, and how do you get a preschooler to understand the concept of ""jamming""??? It's just not very logical. On the bright side, the illustrations are interesting and memorable, and like I said before, the book makes my students laugh. It's a useful book for teaching the names of some instruments, so long as you don't take the book seriously. I recommend ""Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin"" way more though."
5,Perfect,I recieived this book in wonderful conditon and very quickly. It was exactly what I was looking for to use in my Summer Reading Program.
2,Offbeat,"My 3 year old grandson enjoys the book more than I do. I find the illustrations rather bazaar. The upside is that he has learned the names of the instruments and loves to say,""perhaps he shall bellow!"", as I read it to him."
1,I hate hate hate this book,"I can't even talk about it right now I'm so upset. All I can say is, it's more of the House that Jack Built crap.After getting such awesome books in the first shipment (Can You Find It Outside, Can You Hear It and Zin Zin Zin a Violin.), this is a big disappointment."
1,Watered Down,"This book bills itself as an introduction. It is only $44.95 as of this writing, but it isn't worth it. The free J.P. Morgan Credit Derivatives Guide (RISK Publications) handed out at some conferences has as much substance, but also has the virtue of being free. The material in this book is very similar to the free research - too similar - and one can find this much on the web.While many competing books are more expensive, they have more substance. There are several newly published credit derivatives books to choose from, and I would recommend giving this one a miss."
2,Overpriced Paper,"Juvenile pop culture references, an inconsistent ""compilation of my notes"" writing style, steeped in the jargon of fixed income, weak coverage of similar securities outside of the asset class (EDS vs. vanilla call), and stupifyingly overpriced given its breadth and length. This is really a hard-backed journal paper that should be purchased only with someone else's money."
1,AWFUL!,"The only good thing about this CD is that it ends somewhat quickly. The first mix is okay, but not as good as the album version. The next two mixes are DREADFUL. They are so slow and overproduced that all of the fun of one of Bjork's best songs is totally lost. The last mix is the worst. Unfortunately, it's also the longest. I don't know why anyone would willingly sit through six and a half minutes of this stuff. It KILLS the song. really, I like Bjork more than anyone I know, but this CD is NOT worth eleven dollars!"
2,Callas Great - Sound Quality Lousy,"Cherubini's Medea is most likely one of the most beautiful and powerful operas ever written, and Maria Callas sure knows how to sing it. Bernstein does a typical Bernstein job to conduct it, and it is life. However, I personally didn't like the recording, and find the sound quality too bad. There is another recording out there conducted by Tullio Serafin, with much better sound quality and at least the same drama. Do not make the mistake and mistake one for the other. In particular, you can try to buy the Serafin version on Amazon, and you might just get the Bernstein version (this is how I ended up with my version)."
1,Great performance - terrible mastering,"This great recording is totally sabotaged by the mastering EMI used. This was one of the recordings issued by EMI in conjunction with Callas' horendous sister Jackie, who claimed ownwership of Callas' live material (and EMI believed her????) Anyway this is a copy of old Verona CDs but the sound is muffled - if you want this performance in better sound, try and find the original Verona CDs 27088/9; also the Melodram is supposed to be OK. But avoid this set."
4,Must Have for SU Fans,"While not exactly what I expected this DVD does not disappoint. I expected the DVD to entirely focus on the SU run to the championship which it does, but also captures all teams from the field of 65. Once it transitions to the SU only coverage this thing is a gem. Great angles and new looks at plays that weren't included in the original broadcast of the game. Being at the Final Four I missed the live telecast of the games but thought this captures everything perfectly. I also like the fact that the crew from CBS captured me and my boys cheering on the Orange from the stands of the Superdome. I always knew I was destined for DVD but never thought it would tie into the Orangemen. This is a must have and wouldn't pass this up at $$$. This is one you'll watch for years to come."
2,"Unless you're a Cuse fan, avoid","I bought the DVD expecting to get a nice interface where I could easily browse highlights for each of the teams in the field of 65. Instead, I got a short, unorganized highlight reel like the one at the end of the CBS broadcast, and only passing attention paid to the other 3 Final Four participants. The Syracuse stuff is comprehensive, which is fine because they're the champs, but I expected more for everybody else."
2,Not for all,"I bought the DVD expecting a nice overview of the final four leading incl. the victory of Syracuse. Where I live, Amsterdam (The Netherlands, Europe) I wasn't able to see the games. I think the DVD is great for big Syracuse fans, but not for the general basketball fan... The quality of editing is also not what you expect in the 21st century..."
4,Queer is tasty,"The good thing about this book is that is it so simple to read. The words flow perfectly and you dont get tripped up on huge words that nobody knows. The actual story is about a homosexual smack addict and you really feel for the character. You are hoping the best turns out for him and his lover. The character is very likeable. I only gave it 4 stars because the book in the end goes nowhere. Not a great ending, but definitely an enjoyable book."
2,Only 10 minutes long. Bonus Material is BOGUS.,"I rented this expecting approximately an hour long film. The description after all notes that the rental is 49 minutes long with a bonus. The actual ""film"" is at best 10 minutes long. It is a short film about a trans-woman preparing for a date. I expected good things considering that Calpernia Addams is the star. She is the subject of the great film ""A Soldier's Girl"" and the TV show ""Transamerican love story."" I knew it was independent video and wasn't awaiting Oscar gold. However, this item should not be sold as a movie rental. It is a short that belongs on youtube. The bonus material is a making of style video that describes script writing and some other commentary. It's a shame when the making of is 3 times as long as the actual film. Don't spend your money here. Calpernia, your fans deserve better."
4,bought a second one :-),"This machine worked great for creating fake snow. It is made out of a very light plastic,e which allows it to be suspended up high easily, though the trade off is that it isn't a very strong casing. It probably produces the same amount of noise as a small vacuum, which didn't bother me, at the height it was positioned at. I did order a second machine to produce the desired effect i was going for. The only downside is that this machine does need to be positioned high enough so that it creates a snowing effect and not just a foaming effect. At 10 feet (a typical room height) the machine produced a shower of foam. At 20 feet, it made snow flakes of varying sizes. I used this for the grand entrance of my bride at our wedding. She was in huge heals and did not slip on the snow at her feet."
1,Typical Book For school,"This book was a waste of time, just like any other book I bought for school. If you need it, buy it, otherwise avoid it."
5,At last A great country collection of the 50's and 60's,"I thank the people at ACE again for such a great compilation.I'am a fan of music of the 50's & 60's, especially rock 'n'roll, soul and I also like real country music. And now finally there is a collection of country-music availlable. I'ts very diverse and all 30 tracks are good, especially those of the 50's.It is great to hear country music by artists who are not looking as models but can really sing...."
4,Improves on the first.,"If you liked the first one, see this one. If you haven't seen the first one, I'd reccomend you watch it before this. Darker than the first. More action, but a little creepier. One thing about this series is that it messes with your head in confusing you about whats right and wrong. This tape has a lot of that in it."
5,Good series,"The spawn anime series is a good series to look at a more in-depth explanation of spawn's origin, how he develops and the war between heaven and hell. if you missed some thing from watching the movie then u definitely want to get this to figure out everything thats going on"
3,Spawn 2,"I didn't enjoy watching this series had; I did in the past, on the 1st film. The storyline seems to be jumping around trying to tell a story from the first chapter. I found it boring and confusing to say the least; short-live on the action sections which tried it's best in explaining to the viewer with flashback viewing."
3,good,"if it wasnt for the Clown i would have given it two stars, what were they thinking? it had so much to offer, crappy animation, story just drags while Spawn keeps screeming Wanda!!!"
4,"Not Inferior, but not Superior","Although Season 2 of Todd McFarlane's Spawn was good, it just didnt quite compare to Season 1 or Season 3. But if you like Spawn, and have seen the First Season, this is the perfect DVD for you! Dont ever buy the Spawn Live Action Movie!! EVER!!"
3,very good cartoon,"I was a little dissapointed in part 2 cause they began and finished part 1 so well with you really wanting them to continue the story. But then this whole movie they just kind of stand around and put in some cool opponents for spawn, but it isn't nearly as memorable as the first. They continue tellign the story, just not near as much as I wanted them to. The dark mood follows the first movie and you have very cool weird evil stuff happening. Voice acting continues to be superb and now I am just looking for part 3, and there had better be a part 4 and 5 and 6 and 7..."
5,It Was WORTH The Wait!,A must for any freestyle fan... Classic beats from the Upstairs Records crew and even sometimes Stevie B. producer Tolga. If you miss Freestyle and need a new fix this is one CD you will be happy with.Ross
5,Awesome Sauce,"I recently bought this oil lamp and the set of three so that I could use them at my outdoor fire shows. They are stylish and sturdy! I have to cart them around from gig to gig and have found that they aren't leak proof if they tip over while in my gear box, but the manufacturer never made any such claim. I couldn't be happier with this oil lamps design and the flame size is perfect for lighting my equipment off of!"
5,"Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media",This is a brilliant and witty review of the issues concerning global warming.
1,and he calls himself a scientist....,"Michaels effort is very unconvincing to me. To admit that global warming is at least partly caused by human activities, then to argue that it is no big deal and we can all adjust? How do you adjust when your house washes away? It is fortunate indeed that he will no longer be around in another 100 years, when the results of atmospheric CO2 increases will be abundantly clear to all, because those suffering as a result will not look kindly on contrarian apologists for business as usual such as Michaels.He is of course entitled to his fossil fuel industry financed opinion."
3,"Useful, but . . .","As another reviewer put it (in discussing the author's earlier ""Satanic Gases""), this book is a useful beginner's guide, but it should only be read in conjunction with another book that gives the other side of the story. For that I recommend John Houghton's ""Global Warming: The Complete Briefing."" Pat Michaels gives numerous examples of alleged environmentalist exaggeration, but he himself exaggerates in the other direction by claiming that ""We know, to a very small range of error, the amount of any future climate change for the foreseeable future, and it is a modest value ..."" How can he be so sure?"
1,Poor Science,"Poorly written, poorly edited, poorly researched, poorly (and misleadingly) documented, pretty charts. Some say global warming is more politics than science. THIS is the source of the politics; almost all scientists (and more each day) recognize that global warming is a serious problem that should be dealt with. This book is not science but public relations for the oil industry. And with record profits, they have the money to protect their investments. This type of person will give conservative politicians (Republicans) enough ammuntition to say, ""See? Even the scientists don't agree"" and will convince the gullible action need not be taken; better to ""save American jobs.""Michaels says it is a conspiracy of scientists out to hurt the oil industry (and America). The real conspiracy is the oil industry and the Republicans in Congress and the White House."
1,There is no way to debunk facts...,"""Dr."" Patrick Michaels makes claims in his book which are bald distortions of the facts. A very cursory glance at his affiliations shows quite clearly that his entire body of work was produced while he accepts funding from the energy sector... those companies which have a great deal to lose if a massive response to the Fact of Global Warming takes place. None of his studies cited in this book are peer-reviewed outside of the energy coalitions that pay him.Sorry folks, but he really is a schill. If you don't believe it, just do a little research. Of course it's more comfortable believing 'everything will work out on it's own'... isn't it?"
1,A question of funding...,"One must ask, who signs Mr Michaels' pay cheque. Is his just another 'objective' voice funded by the vested interests who have the most to lose if society moves away from a carbon intensive economy. If an author funded (indirectly) by the tobacco industry wrote a piece questioning the link between cancer and smoking, how seriously would you take it?"
1,This book is pure baloney and propaganda,"Global warming is not controversial among scientists. For many years, there has been almost universal agreement among climate scientists that global warming is happening, and that human pollution is largely responsible.So why is this still controversial? Largely because a handful of skeptics, like Michaels, have thrown up a dust cloud of confusion around the issue through popular books, newspaper opinion pieces, television and radio appearances, and other tactics. They have skillfully exploited the media's desire for ""balance"" in their reporting, when in fact, they are in an extreme, scientifically isolated minority. Many politicians have been swept up in their deceptions.Michaels gets huge amounts of money from the coal and oil industries, which stand to lose if we start getting serious about addressing climate change. Doesn't that say it all about this man's credibility?"
5,A reality check on global warming.,"For 15 years now the media has fed us an apocalyptic vision of global warming. Seldom are sceptical voices heard. When they do get through, a feeling can persist that their opinions are scientifically on shaky ground. The great thing about Michaels' book is that not only is it a well written, digestable and at times witty read, but everything he says is backed up with a either a scientific reference or a clear graph. This is a tour de force for anybody who wants to be armed with some home truths about the real nature of global warming and the unhealthy, closed loop that can exist between elements of the scientific community, the government and the media."
5,Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists...,"I buy copies of these for a friend of mine, a Ph.D. who uses them in his lectures on global warming."
5,The corruption of the scienceic method.,"This book introduces the corruption of the scientific method in the pursuit of a political conclusion: anthropogenic global warming.I was always of the impression that the research one engaged in was supposed to lead to conclusions based upon your research results and that if your research data did not support your hypothesis, that the contrary conclusion was what was presented and submitted for review. This doesn't seem to be always the case any more as research is guided more by a foregone conclusion, man is causing global warming, and further research must in some way support this hypothesis in order to be peer reviewed, printed in scientific publications, and to get further research funds.This well written book puts such things into perspective and shines a spot light upon the subjugation of scientific endeavors for a political agenda when it comes to climate change.Wes Wotring"
5,"A wonderful, wonderful book","I first read this book five years ago when my first son was born. It has opened a way to communicate with my baby that has been an experience I still treasure. The massages have certainly had a very positive effect on his development, the book is also remarkable if you consider that this is a man writing with an unusual sensitivity about a mother-child issue."
3,Loving Hands: The Traditional Art of Baby Massage,An excellent resource for mothers and care-givers of infant children. This book helps to equip the care-giver to be better care-giver. Part of the book was non-traditional in the sense of it being a resource book.
1,Not in very good shape,"When I was buying this book, it said it was in very good condition and when I received it I found it to be in pretty bad shape. There were water marks, and a chunk of the corner of the book gone. I expected more. The book is what I was looking for, however the condition was not described properly."
3,It was ok,"I was a little disappointed with this book because it didn't cover any new ground for me. But more importantly, the style began to grate on me about half way through the book, to the point where I just wanted to get it over with. I felt Alison Plowden relied too heavily on extracts from comments and speeches made by people of that era. These were popped in every now and again which, for me, meant I would ""lose the plot"". I'd have to re-read sections because I couldn't remember what point was being made. And, not being an expert in ""old English"" (despite the fact that I was born in England, and my daughters keep telling me I'm old!), I'd sometimes struggle to understand what was being said. Still, this is only the humble opinion of one reviewer, and I'm sure that there would be a great many people to whom this style would be perfectly acceptable. Having said all that, it wasn't a ""bad"" book. I'm pleased I bought it, and wouldn't like to have missed out on reading it."
3,"A perfectly good performance, just not the listed works","In place of BWV 1036 (a spurious work, probably by CPE Bach), they include the trio sonata from The Musical Offering. If you don't particularly care, the performance is perfectly good (with a few minor quibbles about the flutes in the low register). Three stars only because I bought the CD for BWV 1036."
5,worth the read,"Well worth the time to read and soak up. I have read through it twice and was able to get past so many of the bad memories of my youth and to stop reacting to incidents in present day as if I were still back in those situations, don't know if that makes any sense, but I just know it was a turning point in my life when I got through this book!"
1,didn't work,This product didn't work at all. Not hdmi or dvi. I tried many different things. I am disappointed with product
1,Didn't work for me,"I do understand that this is a splitter and not a switch. I was hoping to take the HDMI signal from my satellite receiver and send the HDMI connection to my big-screen and the DVI connection to a small panel in my bedroom (only a few feet through the wall.) While the HDMI connection worked, the DVI connection didn't. Perhaps it's my TV or my cables but I doubt it."
3,Revised review,"I originally gave this song 2 stars, but I threw another one on because although I'm not that impressed with the lyrics, it's really hard not to start dancing when the music comes on, especially those guitar riffs. Still, let's just hope the Donnas showcase better lyrics for their next album (I have no problem looking at them though; calling them sexy would be an understatement).Anthony Rupert"
5,great product,"Love it. We live in brooklyn, ny; so we use the car on the weekend quite a bit. This snugride is perfect to use with the car. But my wife also uses this during the day for daily walk with our baby. Our baby is now 4 months old, we bought bigger stroller (maclaren techno), but we haven't used maclaren once yet. Because this so far is still big enough for our baby. Actually, my wife told me that she used maclaren once only and space underneath on maclaren wasn't great. This snug ride does really have much space under the seat, so when we go grocery shopping, we use it.When we used it first time, we had a hard time reading instructions on how to fold this thing....i guess I don't understand english or instructions...:) so we had to pull youtube real quick, and it was easy to follow watching the video than reading instructions.overall glad we purchased it."
4,Happy with this purchase,"This is a good stroller frame and accommodates the seat and other baggage well, comes in handy for family outings or just going to the store with the little one in her car seat."
5,I love it!,This carseat stroller is very light and handy. I can bring it anywhere I want without worrying where to put it because I only using a small car. It fits in the trunk good and can put a lot of baby stuff under the stroller. I love it!
4,Great concept. Great implementation.,"Works exactly as advertised. It is perfect for our needs. Easy to use. Not cumbersome. Now that I've seen it in action for a few weeks, I'm even more impressed with this product."
5,Light weight and easy to carry,Pros:It is very light weight and easy to carry with you. We wanted the frame coz we thought we might get a different stroller once the baby grows up. Easy to fold down and competitively priced.Cons:Certain times its little hard to unfold the frame. The storage space underneath is not very easy to reach.
5,"Quick to use, lite to carry - awesome stroller","Does exactly what you want it to do - nothing more, nothing less. High quality, easy to put together, and fits great in the trunk of my wife's car. Very lite, easy to carry, and a snap to fold up when not in use. Basket underneath is great for storing diaper bag, blankets, etc. Our Graco car seat snaps in securely and makes going on walks or grocery store trips a breeze. Being able to transport baby from the car to the stroller without removing her from her carseat works awesome. Really convenient when she is napping and you don't want to wake her! Great stroller."
4,Very handy,"This fits the snug ride perfectly and has a lot of storage space. I like that I can attach a ""mommy hook"" and carry all of my shopping bags & my purse. The only negative is that is it not the easiest to steer."
5,Very happy,"For the price and the relatively short lifespan required from this pram, it is wonderful. Utilitarian and practical.We adore not having to remove our son from the infant car seat.Only neg about this system is that in the car seat our son is strapped in fairly tight, as required. I would be happy with him slightly less constricted in the pram but changing the harness length would never be an option as it would be such a nuisance. Thus, the babe is very very safely attached to his pram but perhaps not as comfortable as I would like him to be."
4,Works well with Chicco Keyfit 30,"I'm spoiled by the maneuverability of my BOB Revolution, so this is not as maneuverable, but it is handy. I had a c-section, so needed this to get baby to the car in weeks 3-6 if we needed to drive somewhere. It's also easy and quick to fold and store in the trunk. I wish there were a way to add a sun shade (car seat + BOB = total sun shade), but other than that it is handy as a trunk stroller for when at stores, etc. Four stars for their discouraging use with other seats than Graco. It does not snap in like I presume Graco seats do, but sits in there snugly. No worries on flat ground at all."
3,"About what I expected, but it's rusting already!","Given the price, I didn't expect this to be a dream to push or very stylish, for that matter. That said, you can't get around the fact that if your baby likes to sleep in the car, it's great to be able to pop their car seat into the stroller without waking them. For that reason, I'll probably be using this as long as possible.BUT, we're only 1 month into winter weather and already the salt is rusting the wheels. If we're lucky we'll make it through the winter but do not expect this frame to last through a second child."
3,It's okay.,"I found that this product is a little difficult to unfold, the wheels get stuck together and they need to be pulled apart. I owned another model with my first born and found it a joy to use, but decided on this brand when I purchased a Graco car seat for out latest addition. If I had it to do again I would not make the same decision."
3,Would Have to Pass,"I borrowed this snap n go from a friend. While I appreciated not having to pay for it, if I were going to purchase one of these types of things I would pass on this one. There is no suspension. Every time I went over a crack or bump in the sidewalk it jolted my infant and at times woke her up. I know you can't expect miracles from one of these things but I did want to let folks know that the wheel suspension leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Was not right for me,I bought this frame because I was not sure what stroller I should get. It's pretty light but it's the only good thing about it. My husband and I both are tall and we constantly stepping on the frame while walking. I would suggest to do your reaserch on a good stroller and skip this one. I would go for Upperbaby Vista stroller that has a basinet that you can use from the very beginning. It's expensive but it's worse it.
3,half n half stroller,"My daughter loved it. When you travel by air you have to take the car seat, so why take a big stroller when you can just take the frame? Its great, however I wish you could turn the seat facing forward also."
3,go for the more expensive model,i love this concept and this stroller did the trick but i would pay a little bit more for the better built one if you know what i am talking about... after 5 months the front wheel would get stuck and stopped turning. we used it a lot for walks and it didn't handle the sidewalks too well... overall i was very happy.
3,Good for car trips,"We have two strollers, and use the Graco infant seat with both of them. The expensive Bugaboo (with Graco connector attachment) is great for New York streets, because it handles curbs, cobblestones, stairs, whatever. But collapsing and stowing the Bugaboo is a real pain - it takes a good two or three minutes, it's heavy, there's multiple parts, and you have to wrestle with them. That's where this Graco comes in handy. If you're not planning on taking any taxis, take the Bugaboo. If you're jumping into cars, then the Graco collapses really quickly and is light. However, it doesn't have suspension, it's hard to get it up over curbs, it comes to a stop when you hit bumps or cracks, and it doesn't turn so smoothly (this is all put in relative terms to the superb handling of the bugaboo)."
5,Does its job well.,"Perfect for the car, does well in stores and even on short neighborhood strolls (half hour to an hour). Lightweight, compact and easy to use. The car seat frame is a workhorse, nothing fancy. Well-made and highly recommended, by this mother of a 3month old, as a first stroller. We will move on to a jogger at six months of age when a child can safely be put in a jogger.M..."
5,It's good!,It is quite brilliant!It perfectly fits on Graco Snugrider infant car seat that I have received from my aunt as gift and it is very easy to handle. Assembling the wheels and cup holders was not difficult so that I myself(being pregnant) could easily do that without any help. ;)
5,Graco Stroller frame is a great purchase!,"I am so happy that I bought this stroller frame. It's easy to use and convenient for those quick trips to the store, etc. I would highly recommend this product."
1,Tires often got stuck when folded,I inherited this stroller from my sister. I hate the fact that the tires often got stuck when trying to be unfolded. The only thing I like about this stroller is the huge basket for shopping.
2,VERY VERY difficult to UNFOLD!!!,"VERY VERY difficult to UNFOLD!!!Don't want to push too hard to break the plastic lock. Then have no idea how to unfold it easily. Feel terrible and angry now :((((After struggling for a long time, finally figured out the reason hard to unfold is due to the two big stupid front wheels. They are very easy to stuck when you fold it. Move them outwards before unfold."
3,Meh. Not as easy as I expected,"I was really excited about getting this because we are going to be traveling with our baby in the next couple of months and this will help at the airport. AFter getting it I am not quite as excited. My biggest disappointment, and it's significant, is that YOU CANNOT OPEN THIS WITH ONE HAND. There is some sort of lock thing on the side that, as far as I can figure out, has to be pushed simultaneously while pressing the button and turning the handle at the top. Even using two hands it is a major pain. I thought a light stroller frame like this would be easier not MORE difficult to use than my large stroller. Ah well, at least it is lighter and less cumbersome and maybe I'll get used to the lock."
5,Perfect for our needs,"Purchased this as a second more portable stroller after purchasing an $500 Easy Walker qtro stroller which was very sturdy but heavy, bulky and did not fit in a Lexus gs300 trunk without some disassembly and fustrating collapsing routine, which is just ridiculous for the hefty price tag.The Graco was light, very portable (fit quickly and easily in my trunk) and covered all the basic necessities . And for the price it cannot be beat as a very reliable second stroller."
3,Not bad but there is a better option...,"I really did like this stroller frame for my Graco Snugride 22 but in retrospect, I wish I hadn't bought it. The Graco Literider weighs less than 2 pounds more, carries the car seat every bit as well, has it's own shade for extra protection and a better cupholder(mine kept falling off, they arent attached very well to frame). The real plus is that it's useful even AFTER baby outgrows the infant seat as a secondary stroller. Economically, it just makes more sense. Something to think about.Graco Literider Stroller, Lively Dots"
4,Works Well,"Purchased this stroller to go with our Graco Snugride 35 infant carseat. Was told this was made to specifically fit this model carseat, but we find it kinda hard to snap in - seems as if the carseat is just a tad too big - it does fit, just takes some coordination. Other than that works great - nice and lightweight - perfect for the mall."
5,Great light weight stroller!,"A friend recommended this to us. We bought the graco travel system, but this stroller is great to have when you are making a quick run to the mall or running an errand. The car seat snaps right in so traveling is a breeze. Plus the one hand fold makes it easy to fold and it takes up less space then the full size stroller."
5,Total Convenience,"This product is a life saver. No bulky strollers to deal with ... just a simple, easy frame to take the load off carrying a heavy infant seat carrier. I was afraid it would be overkill to have this AND a stroller but it is not. I keep this in my car at all times and use it when I go to a big building with a long walk from the parking deck or a department store, etc. I basically use it when a lot of walking is involved and there aren't shopping carts. It's GREAT."
4,Awesome!,"This was a lifesaver for me after having a c-section. It's super light weight, breaks down with one hand and a foot, and is very easy to maneuver with one hand. The handle is adjustable so taller people don't kick the wheels. I am short (5'2"") and I love how I can keep an eye on my baby and easily reach her while still moving. While traveling, I wear my baby, check the car seat, and use the base to hold my carry on luggage. At the gate I grab my bags, hand the stroller over to the attendant, and walk in the plane. Very convenient.I gave it four stars instead of five because the cup holders do not hold standard water bottles, but it is good for keys and cell phone. Also, although the basket is large, it is hard to reach once the car seat is in place."
4,Great for travel and errands!,Compact snap and go that is extremely easy to use! I find myself using this more than my Baby Jogger City Mini because of the ease of use as well as the large basket underneath.
5,Love it!,Love this graco stroller frame. So lightweight. I had the carseat/stroller combo with all my other kids and it killed my back lugging it in and out of the car. Wish they had this years ago!
5,best money I've ever spent,"This is the best money I have ever spent - it's so quick and easy and lightweight. The basket underneath offers ample storage, it is perfect for a day of shopping, running a quick errand or walking your dogs. The carseat gets very heavy for me to lug, so it's nice to be able to pop it in here and go. The cup holder is my only complaint - it's not very deep, so if you are going over some rough terrain, your drink will likely topple over. Overall though, a fantastic purchase for the price. Only wish I had gotten it sooner. (It is compatible with the Snugride 32)"
5,TOP of the list for the most useful things so far,"This is an absolutely MUST HAVE!Easy, convinient, useful. Great for small grocery shopping and for shopping itself. Can handle a lot of heavy stuff in the basket- christmas proofed! Absolutely love 2 cupholders and a little box on top where you can put keys and cell phone and close it. I`m so happy that I bought it for my chicco carseat, I would recommend it to everybody.Totaly worth the money. AMMMAAAZIING!!!!!!"
5,Easy to use and assemble.,"Love this stroller frame. I have the Graco Snugride 30 carseat and thought this would be perfect to use with it b/c its so lightweight. This frame is also really easy to put together. All you have to do is put on the wheels and they just click on. Easiest assembly I've ever seen. I'd highly recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to deal with a full size gigantic travel system stroller for their newborn. If you buy the larger style Graco carseats, you'll be able to use this stroller frame for longer."
5,Awesome stroller!!,This is the perfect transport option while a baby is in the larger carriage type car seats. A large basket to carry diaper bag and any extras. Instead of breaking your back and carrying the baby and carseat everywhere use this lightweight transport option. It's my favorite stroller for the first year.
5,can't live without it,we live on a 5th floor walk-up in manhattan. this stroller with the snugride car seat is the only way we could manage it. lightweight. easy to use. sturdy enough. high recommended for anyone with space issues or stairs issues.
3,Wish the handle would adjust for taller people,"At 5'10"" I've found the stroller handle to be a little short. My husband can't stand to push the stroller for long because it's even worse for him (at 6'2"").Also, when the handle is in the ""tall"" position (which should work well for someone who is 5'8""), the stroller is so close to your body that you end up kicking the frame when you walk.Only other complaint is the orange latches that keeps the foot of the carseat in place. These are very difficult to twist, so it's hard to undo them.Otherwise, I like the stroller. It's easy to fold and unfold (as long as you can use both hands). Diaper bag and blankets easily fit in the basket. Cup holders are convient for a bottle of water."
5,Happy Traveler,"This was just what I was looking for. A compact companion to the Graco Snugride Carrier that would open/close easily, be light-weight and fit in the trunk of my car with extra room to spare since I wanted to carry it with me all the time. Open and close is easy, once you get the hang of the twisting handle and it maneuvers well. I'll have it for years because this is our first grandchild and I imagine more will come along."
2,A bumpy ride,"I love the concept of this stroller frame along with my Graco infant carseat. The problem is that this stroller is not good for using to take your baby on walks. The wheels don't have enough shock absorption and this makes for a bumpy, jolting ride that had my baby being shook awake every few seconds. I suppose the stroller would be sufficient for walking in a mall or some place that had smooth flooring, but if you are intending to use the stroller for walking around sidewalks and crossing streets, I'd get something else with better rubber tires."
5,love it!,"easy to put together!it has cup holders!good size basket underneath!compact! great for small cars!adjustable handle! (I'm short, hubby is tall)It will be perfect until my baby is older."
2,Graco Car Seat owner prefers Snap 'n' Go frame,"We travel _a lot_ with the baby and have a Graco car seat. When ourKolcraft Universal Infant Car Seat Carrierwore out, we bought one of these thinking it would be better with our car seat, but my husband, our sitter, and I hate it so much we actually gave it away. The Graco stroller frame is nearly impossible to steer, locks up at odd times, and is difficult to fold with one hand. Really infuriating after how great the Kolcraft was."
1,No! No! Don't buy this - buy the Snap & Go instead!,"This stroller, though handy, has two major flaws:1) It is difficult to unfold, and2) Once the carseat is snapped in place, it is VERY difficult to get any items in and out of the basket due to the fact that the carseat rests very low on the frame.My advice: Buy the Snap & Go instead!! My friend has one and her basket is easily accessible with the carseat in place."
1,Don't buy!,"Just purchased and used once at airport pickup and 2 short walks down the block. At return to airport, front wheel snaped off and couldn't use to get our 9 week old into airport. Terrible design and terrible plastic base on wheel.Do not buy!"
1,What a piece of GARBAGE!,"Great. So my wife and I purchased this ultra-convenient frame/stroller for convenience. It worked great for about 8 weeks, then one of the front wheels bent to where we couldn't use it anymore. AND, the front wheels would at times jam the stroller from opening up in the first place. In concept, a frame/stroller like this is awesome, but Graco needs to redesign this and make it better and sturdier. All in all, a major dissapointment."
1,It was very bad stroller!,It is an awful carriage! It made from a rigid fabric and looks not aesthetically. And it is not comfort for baby
1,Great product until YOUR CHILD FLIPS OUT,"I absolutely loved this product for three months. It's light weight, has lots of basket space, and is easy to travel with. I was so excited about my purchase, but after three months things went down hill. First the latch that you press to unfold the stroller kept jamming. Then the front wheels started to lock on their own. This was all stuff I found annoying, but could live with. Then the parts that hook in to keep the side of the car seat on the side that the parent pushes started popping loose. The worst part is that I didn't even notice until I went over a pothole while crossing the street and the car seat flipped out and over. Thankfully he was harnessed in tightly and it stayed attached to the strolled on the back side. We got so lucky! I really don't recommended this product. My son got lucky, but as I read in other reviews, not everyone is so lucky. Please go with the baby trend snap n go!"
5,WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT,"I made the mistake of buying a MetroLite stroller from Graco to go along with my car seat before I realized this product was the best invention EVER. It is SO easy to do one- handed, it is light and has the room underneath for your diaper bag or purse or both. I am still using the frame I got 5 years ago for my first child now for my second and its still intact. Before you make the mistake of buying one of those HUGE BULKY strollers to go with your infant car seat- get this instead. It is the BEST!!"
4,Mitch Miller Sing Along CDs,"I was delighted with the quality of the recording--especially compared to my over-used LP albums. I was disappointed, though, that the CDs do not include sing-along words, as my LPs do."
3,LONG-AWAITED SEQUEL IS NOT WHAT EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"THIS TIME, A FEMALE ALIEN [LARA FLYNN BOYLE] ENDANGERS THE EARTH IN A QUEST FOR THE LIGHT OF ZARTHA. AGENT J [WILL SMITH] MUST FIND THE RETIRED AGENT K [TOMMY LEE JONES] AND RESTORE HIS MIB MEMORY SO HE CAN RID THE EARTH OF THIS THREAT. NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL, BUT IT'S STILL OK. ONE HILLARIOUS SCENE IS WHERE MICHAEL JACKSON TRYS TO CONVINCE AGENT ZED [RIP TORN] THAT HE'S WORTHY OF BEING IN THE MIB. GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS, BUT ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS ANOTHER SEQUEL THAT FAILS TO COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL. BUT, THIS MOVIE MAKES AN ALRIGHT SCI-FI/COMEDY."
2,A good solid 10 minute movie,"Smith was Jones and Jones was Smith again but... Some said that with MIB I once you saw the trailer, you saw the movie. But MIB I was a lot of fun. MIB II was only fun for the first 10 minutes. I didn't hear a single laugh for the rest of the movie. There was an ocasional smile, therefore 2 stars instead of 1. Once the dog character was replaced by tommie Lee jones, the movie just seemed to be a waste there after. Not recommended."
3,A Disappointment,"MIB II is a disappointment. It simply does not have the originality of the first and everything is too predictable. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's been on a bender in this one, too, and hasn't quite got it together. This was a movie that could have been even better than the first, but it fails by a wide margin."
3,OK,WAS AN ALRIGHT MOVIE> I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR MOVIES LIKE THIS BUT MY BOYS ENJOYED IT> ALSO OWN PART 1
4,Love streaming through amazon,This movie was very good. It's hard to make sequels that are as good as the orig but they came really close. It was a very good movie
2,Not comparable with the first Men in Black,I will skip to MIB III. There are so many good movies out there so why waste your time on this one.
3,Typical Studio Fare,"Seeing this flick was a lot like eating Chinese food, it seemed good at the time but I walked out of the theatre thinking, `I'd like to see a movie!'"
3,A fun summer movie,The first one is better but this one is A LOT funnier. Overall a let down but worth checking out anyway if you like light fun summer comedies. 3.5 stars.
4,My Family and I enjoyed this movie!,"After reading the reviews posted here, I decided to take my family to see the movie.I don't know why so many people disliked this movie. My family and I enjoyed this movie and are waiting for the Video to be released so that we can watch it many more times."
2,This movie is not all that believe me,this movie [is not good] i only watch cause will smith was in it and they show the commercials like a thousand time on tv and i was like what the heck lets watch it. i came to the movie watch it the only intresting thing was the popcorn it was all useless i watch it theres alot of good computer animation and [garbage] but nothing funny serious when the movie was over i came out thinking what the hell the movie was about i dont know what was the plot of the story to save the girl no it couldnt been it gotta be something else an dmy aunt ask me what it was about i was speechless nothing couldnt come out so if you guys want to buy the movie you are taking a risk enjoy the movie
1,This Movie Stinks. Period.,It's like having someone fart in your living room for 90 minutes.What a lemon.
1,Deception,"I realize that I paid a low price for this item, but the description left much to be desired, such as truth.The disk came in a ratty, beat up case that was not the original, but some generic case they just threw the disk into. The disk was so badly scratched that none of my DVD drives would play it, not even the ones in my computers. The disk should have been pitched in the trash because it was garbage, not sold to some unsuspecting boob. This is one unsuspecting boob who won't quietly go away.All attempts at communication failed miserably, they either don't check email or don't respond to it.This is the first (and I hope the last) time I've had to give an Amazon vendor a bad review, but I have no choice, this transaction was terrible and borders on fraud. I gave it one star because it wouldn't zero stars."
3,Okay Sequel,"Personaly, I thought the first MIB was better. It seems the movie is lacking in a lot of areas, that the first one didn't. Of course, most sequels to movies will not seem to fill the needs of a viewer. For me this movie didn't fulfill the expectaions I had of it."
3,worth watching,Not as good as the first one but that's not really fair to compare them. MIB 1 is great.This is good but lacks slightly in every area.
2,Just doesn't work for me,"This one is just a silly rehash of the first one, an obvious cash in on based on the success of the first film. The film was very short and the script took what, a week? They just slapped together this one, realizing that people would see it anyway, and by the time the word of mouth spread about this being bad, well, most everyone will have seen it already. The funny moments are few and far between. Frank was funny, and Tommy Lee Jones' post office clothes were funny. That's about it. It had enough for me to give two stars, but I wouldn't recommend it. I would recommend the first one, though. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and fee free to leave me a helpful/not helpful review."
1,Too Much Money,"I can't believe anyone would let this movie be produced for the amount of money it cost to make it. Surely someone could have written a decent sequel to the first one (which was wonderful). I am sorry I spent any money seeing this movie. Not real original with the jokes. It was a true waste of talent for T. Jones and W. Smith to have been in this movie, and what an embarrassment for both of them!"
1,use the flashy thing on me so i will forget this trash!,"horrible. This is probably one of the top 25 worst movies ever. It gets only a couple new ideas the rest borrowed from the oriinal, entertaining MIB, and every other movie. I laughed twice. One was more of a smile than a laugh. I kept looking at my watch waiting for the movie to let out, its really shory but seemed longer than almost every movie. Too many stupid movies add to the horrible script and the result is this ""movie"". It is a rehash of a way better prequel. Hard to believe this was made in the same decade let alone year as the astounding Minority Report. A COMPLETE letdown."
1,Biggest disappointment in awhile.,"The plot completely ruins the sweet and touching ending of the first. Patrick Warburton character and Smith's love interest are completely unnecessary and sometimes annoying. The villain pales in comparison to the cockroach guy in the original.By the end of the movie, you simply do not care how it turns out.Terrible, Terrible, Terrible."
2,Pathetic - VOLUME <> QUALITY,"What happened to this movie?? That is the question that I kept asking myself as I watched this mess. Sure, there were parts of this movie that were interesting and funny but the overall effect was very unpleasant. Will Smith's overblown performance got tiresome real quick and the Worms make Jar-Jar Binks look like Sir Laurence Olivier! This movie could have been alot better, why do Hollywood movie makers have so much trouble with good movie concepts like Men In Black?"
2,MIIB doesnt have the right touch,"first of all, for all you people who saw MIB and want to see the sequel, don't waste your money, its cheaper just to watch the previews on tv. the cast and crew of MIB 2 has made the same mistake as so many other filmakers have by putting every single funny part in tyhe movie in previews.this movie also has several other faults. 1: the length of the movie. the movie is 88 minutes long. that isnt as long as most disney movies. the film has the feel of a disney movie to, except with more sex appeal through the quite beuatiful villain. 2: the movie is to serious to have a place in the MIB franchise. will smith is not as comic as he was in the beginning, and tommy lee jones talks to fast to be funny. such as when he sees will smith again, and quickly mutters,"" ive never worked in a retirement home, what can i do for you slick?""if you appreciate the third austinn powers film, this is a good film to see."
5,Good Movie,I love the series and this installment does not disappoint. Lots of action and humor. Arrived in excellent condition and ahead of schedule.
4,Worms!,The worms are hilarious - easily my favorite characters. And I love the nerds in the comic/video store. Take her to Cambodia and buy her a lobster dinner - FLASH!
3,i didn't care for the movie,so i gave it to to someone for Christmas it was shipped right to me no problem my brother will love it
3,Fun movie but weaker,Will Smith and Tommy Lee are still fun to watch but the story line is a bit predictable and way too many gross alien figures.
2,The men should have stayed gone,"I remember having such high hopes for this movie, but it turned out that the movie trailer had served up all the laughs and the rest of the flick was shockingly dull and un-orginal. But I get it. Sequels are hard and Hollywood are usually a greedy lot. The plot re: returning the Light couldn't have been more campy or paper thin if you tried. But, and it's a big but, it may have worked a little better for children. I'm not sure. I don't have children. Anyhoot, if you have absolutely nothing to do or you're searching for what NOT to do with a sequel, check this film out. Otherwise, watch the first movie and then pretend that this one never happened. Where's a good nuturalizer when you need one?"
3,effects-laden sequel with fewer laughs,"I didn't think this sequel to Men in Black was as clever or as fun as the original, but the effects were good and Will Smith and Rip Torn are always fun to watch. Lara Flynn Boyle was not as wickedly fun as Linda Fiorentino, but by all accounts maybe she is easier to work with :-) I thought Tommy Lee Jones was not nearly as funny as he was in the first film; instead of being deadpan, he seems bored here, and rightly so. The action and settings are very similar to the first MiB, though creature design and makeup is very good.DVD extras are average. There is a trailer; a teaser; an ad for the MIB Deluxe edition; trailers for Spider Man, Ghostbusters and Mask of Zorro; a fun animated short, The Chubb Chubbs; and a Crossfire game demo (which didn't work on my computer). There is also a commentary track by director Sonnenfeld, and the film can be heard or subtitled in English or French."
4,A very enjoyable movie,"O.k, so it is not as good as the oringinal ""MIB,"" but it is a summer popcorn blockbuster that does not disappoint. Yes it is near copy of ""Men in Black,"" but I would see it again. The movie is smart in its dumbness and enteraining in its action and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones give hilarious performances that even an MIB know it all can get into. My advice, see it, you will blissfully in low i.q. land."
2,"""I Wasted My Money Again""","I didn't like the first one, but the sequel is worse. Will Smith was horrible but Tommy Lee Jones was great. The plot sucked, Rip Torn was terrible, and The directing was... bad. ""Men In Black 2"" makes ""Bad Company"" look Shakespearean. The Only reason I give this so-called film 2 stars, is because it had some okay visual affects."
2,Stinkety-Stank,"This movie was [bad]. The extras on the DVD were fun, most fun was the short film included in the previews section. Don't bother, it's a rental."
2,The trailer has most of the worthwhile scenes,"MIB II is worse than the first, which I thought was just okay. This movie has a flimsy story, good special effects, some funny scenes, and a story that weakens as the movie goes on. I like Tommy Lee Jones, love Will Smith; but MIB II only gets a C grade from me. If you want to see Will Smith in a better movie, I recommend Independence Day, or even better: Enemy of the State"
3,A stretch..,"First I will say that I loved the first MIB.. and I was in line the first day that the original movie came out.. On the other hand I am glad that I never saw this in the theatre..While this was a very enjoyable movie to watch it lacked some of the witty humour of the first movie.. I laughed very few times and in fact at times was like.. what the? Specially the flush scene.. Cute but, what the heck was up with the cheesy dialogue at the end of the scene?it was nice to see our two agents back in action though.. They came equiped with bigger guns.. and a broader cast of good guys (the worms are back in here)..At times though you do get the feeling that the Director had no idea where he really wanted to go with the movie.."
3,"1 star for the dog, 1 for the worms & 1 for the mini-aliens","Far from what I expected... this movie confirmed the old saying about second parts, which is a pity. So much more could have been done with the script! In the end, the dog that served as partner to Jay (Will Smith) for a little while; the worms that were partying in a hotel room, and the miniature aliens in a locker in central station, provided the distinctive comedy elements that made the movie take 3 (and not two) stars. As for the Smith and Jones, very dim performances, specially Tommy Lee Jones'."
4,Cant wait for men in Black 3,"This was a worthy sequel, we still have all the characters weloved in MIB1 and more. Quality and special effects are great andthe story does'nt slow down for character devellopment.Bring on MIB3...but only if Smith and Jones are in it."
4,4.5 stars: a funny and entertaining sci-fi comedy!,"When this long-awaited sequel to 1997's Men In Black was released in July 2002, it was not very well recieved by critics or audiences. But it managed to make 190 million US dollars at the box office. While that was not up to par with the 250 million of Men In Black I, it was still a good profit. Frankly, I think this is just as good as the first. The FX are better, along with one or two more action sequences then the first. I like this movie, but it seems everyone else hates it. But if you haven't seen this movie yet, don't pay attention to all those one and two-star reviews. This is one heckuva movie!"
4,"Not the Original, but Still Good!","I started watching this movie with very low expectations. I will tell you, I was impressed. Will Smith does a great job reprising his role as Agent ""J."" It was also neat how they brought Tommy Lee Jones back as ""K."" You will have to see the movie."
1,NO CLOSED CAPTIONING!!!!,"what the hell Amazon. No closed captioning for this movie when viewing through the xbox 360!!! this is ridiculous for people that are hearing impaired. the dvd has it, so should you!!!"
3,More of the Same,"Honestly, I bought this for a friend for Christmas (at their request), so my purchase doesn't reflex my desire to see the film. I saw it on video when it came out at Blockbuster, & it was OKAY. Not bad, not great. Too much CG, not enough human interaction. It's pretty much just more of the same stuff that was in the first movie, which is dissapointing considering how many years there were in between the two movies. I will say however, that this is the time I had ever seen or even heard of Rosario Dawson, & she acts well throughout. Oh yeah, and I almost forgot to mention, Lara Flynn Boyle is incredibly hot."
2,Almost as good . . .,"but not quite. Will Smith is cool in the beginning and then suddenly treated like he's a rookie after ""K"" enters the picture--no fair! Will Smith IS cool. Tommy Lee Jones didn't seem as confident in this one, even though he's still cool too. Villain girl isn't gross enough like bug-man from the first one. Worms were great! Needed a few more alien's breaking the rules cases to spice it up a bit. Still love the concept of MIB--perhaps they can fix in MIBIII?"
4,A sequel that is better than the first,Mib II is clearly funnier than the first because it crosses more lines than the first Mib. This film has more adult content than the first movie and far more profanity. It is crazier than te first and one of the very few times a sequel is as good or better than the first. You probably have been discipointed before because a sequel is not as good as the first one. Jurassic Park3 was a terrible film. Best sequel of all time has to be.............T-2. Well the dog is really funny in his larger role in this movie. Bottm Line: B+
1,Whoa...What a disappointment from the first one,This movie was terrible compared to the first one. The story went too fast and it was too short. Thank God I only rented it and not bought it.
1,Warning: RCE. DO NOT BUY!,"If you live in North America (excluding Mexico, because, apparently, they don't count), and have a ""modified"" DVD player, you'll be instructed to buy a DVD appropriate to your region, as indicated by their map. So, this won't play on ""enabled"" machines, even if they're in North America (again, excluding Mexico).It's perfectly legal in the United States to own an ""enabled"" player. What's not legal is for a company to produce a product they know is defective."
1,One of the worst,"Don't waste your money on this totally boring and stupid movie.There is not story, plot, comedy, and absolutely not any fun in this dumb movie.The first MIB was a little bit original, but this sequel is a total disaster---one of the most boring movies I've ever seen!"
2,The Men in Black are back!...But not better than ever.,"I give Men in Black II a score of 2.5 stars out of 5.Well,the men in black are back,but not better than ever.This movie isn't that great.Its slightly entertaining though,and some parts are sort of funny.The storyline is not very great though which means the movie isnt that great.Its not a total disaster but its far from being good.If you don't see Men in Black II your not going to miss anything special but if you do see it then you might have a slighty decent time watching it.I would say you should rent it.Its not worth buying though.Oh yeah,and one more thing,Johnny Knoxville is in this movie.Just wanted to tell you that."
3,They threw out what worked...,"This movie was OK... What made MIB work was Tommy Lee Jones' dry yet cocky confidence and Will Smith's shock at the whole concept always trying to play cool and always 2 steps behind the master Man in Black (Tommy)...Sadly, in MIB-2 Tommy is a waste case, never really taking charge, Head Quarters is infiltrated as easy as holding up a McDonalds (HOW COULD THIS BE...?) and we are left with Will Smith to carry the load through most of the movie (Love you Will but you aint all that...)I'll keep rewatching the first movie and hope for a MUCH BETTER MIB 3...!"
2,Give Me A Break,"This movie was nothing but an attempt to capitalize off of a past hit. The only reason this was made is because MIB 1 did good in the box office. Other than having the same characters and being about aliens, MIBII had nothing to do with the first movie. It did not build a pone the already developed characters and did not offer anything new. If not for the comedy and FX, I would have walked out over the sheer disappointment of the existence of this film. The best thing about this film was that Lara Flynn Boyle walked around half dressed the whole time."
2,Nowhere near as good as the first,"There are some great characters in the movie. The plot is the same. Save the world from aliens. There is some good humor and the acting was good.At the end of the day though I didn't find the movie interesting at all. As a matter of fact, for the first time ever, I fell asleep in a 5 p.m showing of the movie.I go to the movies approximately once a week (maybe every 1.5 weeks.) and I see some great movies two to three times on occasion. I rarely go and watch a movie and then say, ""I hate/disliked that movie."" Movies are designed to take you away from reality and entertain you for a few hours.Men in Black II did not do that for me. I found myself saying ""when will it be over.""Spend your dollars on something better like The Bourne Identity, Sum of all Fears, even Mr. Deeds (which I didn't think was Sandler's bestwork) but don't spend your hard earned $$$ on this movie."
3,Not Enough,"For an hour and twenty minute movie, we should have gotten more. Makes you wonder how bad the scenes were that were cut out. The leading lady is less than interesting. The finest moments belonged to the dog, and most of those have been featured in trailers and commercials. Lots of great special effects, but the story wore thin."
1,back in black...more like boredom....,yadda yadda yadda....sorry but this was very dull...after waiting so long for a sequel i would of thought it could of been better...it just seemed to be lifeless and dull..glad i got it on discount and not full price it was that dire...
1,Someone actually wrote this ...?,"I usually am not that crass but ""..."" was the cleanest word that I could use in a family-friendly website. Well, ""dung"" comes to mind.ALL PARTIES SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED FOR THIS TOTALLY UNFUNNY SEQUEL.Thankfully, Messrs. Smith, Jones, and Sonnenfeld have other films in their respective body of work for which they can be proud.This is not one of them."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it.",Only a shadow of the original. Almost no new ideas. Flat uninteresting script. Dull dialogue.See it only if you are bored and have nothing else to do.The film was VERY formulaic and non-original. Especially the stupid talking dog gag.Major yawn.
4,A great movie,Some said that this movie is just the same old thing with a new villain!!... nu-uh. If you liked the first one you will like this. So what if theres the same writer. He was good and I hope they make a 3rd one.
4,Not highly original but still funny,"Like the editorial review says, MIB 2 ""safely repeats everything that made 'Men in Black' the blockbuster hit."" Which is the reason I watched it; the first one made me laugh, so it was a good bet the second one would, too. And it did.Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are still hilarious as Agents K & J. I love K's deadpan delivery and J's over the top posturing. Sure, maybe the movie could have been more original, but it's still worth a watch if you liked the first one."
3,"OK, but not great.","""Men In Black"", or ""MIB"" was a very good movie. It wasn't, however, a movie that i really wanted a sequel to. I only went to see it based on the fact that the first movie was so good. I left the theater very dissapointed though. The movie was EXACTLY the same as the first one. I mean the plot is even the same. Instead of training Will Smith as an agent, they're training (or re-training) Tommy Lee Jones as a agent. In the end, of course, they save the day and everything is swell. Nothing can save the plot of this movie though."
1,Men in Boring,"The only thing good about this film were the special effects. Everything else was downright awful. It was boring, the acting was bad, the jokes were weak, and the action was uninspiring.I physically hurt just thinking about this film. Please don't waste your time."
2,Back in bleaggghhhhk.,"Some sequels shouldn't be made. This is one of them. The first film was good in a quickie B-movie sense, with it's cool special effects and wry humor. This flick is just plain dumb. It seems like they filmed it in a week and through all of the special effects in to cover what a plotless mess they had. What happened to Johnny Knoxville? His character just dissapeared! The only reason I give this turkey any stars is that my pug Mog found the character Frank to be outrageously humerous."
3,If it weren't for the singing dog...,"Basically, a re-hash, just a bit of script tweaking. Still, there are a few cute and clever spots. Frank, who arfs along to the car radio...the ever charming Smith and the stoic but always dependable Jones...and, NO surprise at all, Michael Jackson as an alien. It's not like we didn't see THAT comin', huh ?"
3,I don't remember the first one...,"and those of you who do, may need to find something else to occupy yourselves besides watching movies. That was five freaking years ago, people! It was a better than average comedy meant to go thru one end of yr brain and out the other, not stay there as if it were something of consequence. And so it is with MIB 2,smartly clocking in at 1:25 and delivering the laughs you expect. I wouldn't buy it, but if you are normal, you will like renting it. If you think you are Roger Ebert, you will be offended. And that is your four bucks, and your problem."
3,It's okay but could be much better.,Men in Black II is a good family movie but is lacking the newness and the independence of the first movie. It's shorter than the first movie but is jam packed with special features that honestly i'll never watch. But this movie is okay overall with a better song (in my opinion) by Will Smith called Back in Black. But on any means do not see this movie before watching the original because most of the jokes are refrences to the original.
2,Disappointed,"Overall, MIBII was a decent show. But I was severely disappointed with one aspect, which really is the emphasis to me writing a review.I loved, absolutely loved MIB. However, I felt that MIB was Tommy Lee Jones's movie, and Will Smith was along for the ride. And as much as I love Will Smith, they seem to have made MIBII his movie, and had Tommy Lee Jones along for the ride, and it just ruined it for me.Perhaps the movies simply speak to two different types of people and I'm much more of a type I then I am a type II, but I enjoyed the first movie far and away better than the second."
3,An ok sequel to Men In Black.,"The first movie was great. However this movie fell short when compared to the first one. It's got a lot of toilet humor and the acting is all right. If you need all three movies then get it, otherwise just rent it and find out for yourself."
3,It's ok,The movie is a bit differant from the 1st flim but funny just the same. i just add it to my collection!
4,Very entertaning,I liked the sequel better then the first MIB. The first had that ridiculous and boring bug guy that wasnt funny at all. MIB 2 is funnier and more entertaning. I love that they showed the dog more in the second MIB. I dont know why so many damned the movie other then the fact they feel an emotional tie to the first so any sequel wont have the right feel for them. Buy this movie. It's tons of fun.
4,Movies are supposed to be fun,"And this one is - unlike the other ""Summer Blockbuster"" Spiderman - which my daughter and I found depressing in tone.MIBII was fun - sure it was similar to the original - but so what? It was still fun, well acted (OK, no Oscars for this kind of movie - but NOT BORING like Star Wars 2!...) and did I mention FUN?!I go to a movie to be entertained. This movie accomplished that.When I left Star Wars 2 and Spiderman I did not feel similarly entertained."
1,Save your $$. If you haven't seen the movie rent it first.,"With as good as the first movie was, this one is just as bad. Not enough Tommy Lee Jones and too little story. Some nice special effects, but all that takes is money and it can't carry a film."
4,Lighten up. . . .,"I enjoyed this movie as much as the first one, mostly because of the way that the characters were making fun of themselves and society. No, it's not a classic that's going to be around forever, but it is an amusing film that fulfills its greatest purpose--entertainment. If you're looking for more than a couple of hours of escapism, you won't find it here. It's not a ""Lord of the Rings"" quality movie, but it's still fun. Smith is good, Jones is good, and the dog's great. The villains are somewhat weak and contrived, but they aren't the point here. It's a lot of fun constantly being reminded that things as we see them are possibly not what we think they are, and wondering what we'd do if we found out that they aren't. This movie is more about enjoying a movie experience, and if you come into it with your own expectations of what this movie should be, of course you'll be disappointed. Just sit down and have fun with this one."
2,A two or three Joke movie.,"A great example of how the second movie can make money without being so hot.You have good actors trying their best but they can't raise this picture beyond a B movie let alone come close to the first one.Smith is funny but not believable, I think they could played te love interest angle different but that's not his fault. Jones overplays the lost agent, Tony Shaloub is a bright spot in the cast and Rip Torn delivers.The over use of Frank the dog didn't help (he's no K-9) and the worms got old real fast.Its also not clear when he K remembers the solution. That hurt too.Rent this one and buy the first picture"
2,Aimed toward younger audience,"I remember watching Men in Black a long time ago and I remember it being pretty good. So naturally, when I heard Men In Black 2 was coming I was ready to go see it. It turned out to be nothing I expected. I think the directors aimed this movie toward a younger audience. Because the jokes were very childish and my niece thought it was hilarious. Anyway, for a children's movie, it was decent, but I'm not watching it again, even though I like Disney movies...."
2,the first is way better,"sorry but this movie just made me mad. I was eagerly anticipating watchin this movie as I had seen the first and really enjoyed it.Ok ive seen it now and I just have to say it is not up to the standards of the first. Its good and at times its a bit funny but for how long can a talking dog be funny? Its funny the first time, mildly amusing the second time it speaks and makes jokes but from then on you just wish it was out down.It isnt really funny and didnt make me laughing out loud like the reviews said it would. It was just a film. An average film and not even the soundtrack that will smith done for this film was played during the film, it was only played in the end credits which is useless.This whole fim was sloppy and tacky and it aint good enough. I wasted money renting it and I just hope they dont make another men in black after this."
4,Better than everyone said it would be,"Okay, I agree, this movie was NOT all it was cracked up to be. Still, after hearing so many people say how bad it was, it proved to be a good investment of an hour and twenty minutes. Even if you don't like it, there is that one redeeming quality--it's less than 1 1/2 hours long.I thought this movie was very funny--funnier than the first. Will Smith, as Jay, completely outdoes himself here, and Tommy Lee Jones contributes to the humor as the cranky, by-the-book Kay. Of course, there is not a whole lot to the plot--what did you expect?--but the movie nonetheless remains very entertaining.MIIB is definitely worth the viewing, though I'd recommend you watch it before you buy it. You may not want to watch this one over and over, but it would be well worth your time to see it at least once."
5,Men In Black 2,This film is for the action and comedy fans. The movie is about The Light of Zorach and an alien trying to get it. The alien scum transforms in to a supermodel and works with a two-headed alien. This movie keeps you laughing until the end. The funniest aliens are the worms that love coffee. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones really do great acting in this movie. Agent J (Will Smith) says everything Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones)liked before his memory was deleted he hates. You should watch this great movie!!!
3,Same planet...New Scum!,"Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles in Men in Black 2. It may not be as great as the first but, this movie never slows down and never takes itself seriously(like the first). This new adventure leads them to another big problem in the universe, seems more like something out of a ""Sightings"" episode. Where ""J""(Will Smith)is out find""K""(Tommy Lee Jones)...again,whos memory was dicesed in the first,and completely renuralizes his memory inorder to find what happend to this ""necklace"" that has myserious powers and if not found will distroy the universe...no need to spoil more. Overall the graphics were dazzling and it was just a fun summer movie you go and take the whole family to go see or for people who ""loved"" the first might wait till video!"
2,What a load o' hooey,"..I've spent more fascinating hours watching ""Iron Chef"" than this bad sequel to an already middling movie."
3,"not as good as the first, but not bad overall","The first one was better, but I still liked the sequel. Will Smith's character seemed a little bit cheesy in this film. First he's upset that know one in the world knows him, then he falls in love with this girl. It's a little too much of you ask me. I was expecting to see a comedy-action movie, not a love story. However, I must be fair. The movie does have it's moments. I especially liked the scene in the post office when Tommy Lee Jones's character finds out that he is surrounded by aliens. The cameo by Biz Markie drew the whole scene together. I would recomend that you do see this movie. Don't buy it though, just go rent it."
2,"Second verse, same as the first!","Here's a waste of an overinflated movie admission for you.There's nothing startling in the fact that 90% of the scenes in this movie were a rehash of the most popular scenes from the original I guess, that's why critics commonly lament sequels. Never before has this been so apparent, though. You'll find yourself asking who could have possibly been responsible for the screenplay, a writer or a test audience from the first film. As David Spade would have put it in a Hollywood Minute, I liked this film the first time I saw it...when it was Men in Black I.To sum up- thin plot, thinner characters, one or two scenes that will make you smirk just like they did the first time around. Skip it in theaters, rent it at Blockbuster."
3,"Well, How Could It Be As Great?","The first movie contained so much bright, original writing. The concept was thoroughly new, the characters had depth and interest.It's a high standard to measure up to. The huge commercial success of MIB I was such that a sequel was almost an economic necessity.So, here it is. And, with much more extensive and expensive special effects, it falls very flat. It's sad, but at the core of this lack of lustre is actually the loss of friction and fun in the interplay between Tommy Lee Jones and Wil Smith. They played off one another brilliantly in the first movie, but here it seems like they're just going through the motions.Sad. I could watch the first movie a dozen times (and maybe I already have), but this one cannot stand up to repeated viewing."
5,good movie,"True story. The movie make me proud of the people, living 2000 years ago. The actors are amazing. Love this movie."
5,Masada movie,I just returned from Israel and went to Masada. One of the people on the trip suggested that I buy the movie to watch. It was very thorough and really helped me to understand how it all happened.
5,Gift,This was a gift for a grandson who was fascinated with the story. I thought he may enjoy Peter O'Toole and he did very much. Great movie.
5,I loved it.,"Full of historical value, great performances, great scenario. A must have in your cinemateca. Highly recommended for history researchers and ancient world aficionados."
3,"Great title, poor manufacturing","Everyone has their likes and/or dislikes regarding this miniseries, mine is a gripe about the DVD itself. I love this show, and I've owned it on VHS for a decade. I was so happy when it finally arrived on DVD, but the DVD is defective. At first I thought it was just my purchase, but the entire run of DVDs from the manufacturer has this problem: Chapter 14 of the final episode cuts off abruptly, eliminating two lines of dialogue. Therefor I must keep my VHS set, and hope for another, properly authored DVD to be released in the future. Boo to Kochvision ([...]) for lack of quality control or the offer of replacement discs, and for not responding to its customers. And boo to Universal for not giving this series the DVD treatment it deserves by mastering it at their own facilities."
5,A Surprisingly Deep Look At The Masada Story,"We first saw this movie on VHS, and never hoped that it would make it onto DVD - and it did! An entertainment miracle...This mini-series is not only a lot of movie for your dollar (several hours), but it does a good job of dealing with the complexity of the Masada story. It gives you a good sense of the length the Romans were willing to go to in order to destroy the Jewish presence in Israel. The Jewish interchanges are a little cheesy, with issues of secular and religious conflict being brought in that might necessarily have applied at the time.Nonetheless, we are really enjoying this emotional movie, and highly recommend it for your collection of Jewish/Israel movies. Plus, Peter O'Toole is awesome!"
3,Excellent...,"MASADA was well acted, and the script was exceptionally well written. I video taped the original broadcast, and was quite happy to see it released on DVD. Peter O'Toole's acting, is, as always, right up there. A great buy (although there isn't much in the way of ""special features"" on this DVD)."
2,Masada-the complete mini-series,"I bought this Mini-series because of the great reviews it got. I was sorry I did. I found Peter O'toole, completely overacting. The storyline had his nemis, very pompous and so full of could have, should have, thoeries it left the viewer annoyed and frustrated. Maybe that's how the real story came to a conclusion. If so, too bad. Even I could have resolved a better outcome. Oh well. To the back of my vidio shelf. Did'nt like the show-movie."
2,Entertainment or Propaganda?,"Being a student of Roman history, the butchery of the facts in this DVD is quite appalling, but I suppose it's no worse than Disney's version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In any event, the melodramatic script is preposterous Hollywood fluff. Anyone who knows anything about the Romans would cringe at O'Toole's scripted part as a Roman governor.Aside from the fact that the story is ridiculous, and that this is blatant Israeli propaganda, I have to give at least two stars because the Roman uniforms were fairly accurate and the scenes with the siege engine were first rate; also, a smattering of the dialogue was actually passably good.Acting wasn't bad either. The poor actors made do with what they were given. All that was missing was Charlton Heston."
4,A recreation of Bible history done with excellence.,Masada is a story of both faith and determination. The Romans had tocrush all resistance to thier rule. The film shows the engineering featthe Romans accomplished to just get to the fortification that was Masada.The film tells the story and it's left to the viewed to decide who thewinner and losers were.
2,Pretty Despicable,"The film almost totally ignores the sole surviving ancient historical account of Masada (contained in Josephus' ""Jewish War"") as well as the evidence found during modern excavations of the site in favor of presenting an almost wholly made up and, at times, tawdry melodrama. The only events in the film which come from the sole ancient source (Josephus) are the building of an inner wall of wood and earth for the fortress and its subsequent destruction by fire. All other events in the film are devices employed in the service of a fraudulent patriotic fantasy--as any legitimate scholar of the ancient world will attest. As pure drama, this film would not be so bad. Unfortunately, the film does not settle for that--it also claims to be actual history, and, on that scale, it fails miserably. Worse than only not informing, it actually misinforms its tabloid browsing, television ""Movie of the Week"" watching audience."
3,Good history lesson,"I recently did a tour of Israel and the guide told us to get a copy of this movie. I don't think it is a great depiction of what actually happened, as the Roman leader did not have a kind heart or want to save the Jews.It was a general idea for this movie, as the facts are a bit different than this movie would have you believe. But that's Hollywood for you! I did enjoy the movie, however, as it made my visit to Masada more realistic."
1,not to good / waste of money,I found this movie slow boring and one not finished. I cut it off boooooooo
2,Masada shall not all again,"Masada is sometimes described as the Jewish Alamo.There were 185 Texians defenders of the Alamo and 4000 Mexican agressors. The Texians fought to the death.The number of Jewiish fighters at Masada was approcimately 1000, the Romans had around 5000.Masada was an easily defended mountain fortress rising 1000 feet above the desert.The Alamo was a simple wooden stockade with no elevation.The Jews chose to commit suicide rather than fight to the death.I suppose the reason ""Masada will not fall again"" is that it is supposed the Americans will fight to the death to defend the Israelis and pay trillionsin Israeli inspired wars.That's the way it has been.If somebody would run for President on a platform which said Israel was on its own, I would vote for him. That's what Ron Paul says. Maybe I will vote for him (again).Shalom you-all."
4,Pretty good for an older TV series,"I have been to Masada a few times and wanted to see this movie to compare it to the actual location. Overall it is pretty accurate in terms of the feeling of the desert location.It is not a terribly exciting movie, with much of the show being discussions about if each side is doing the right thing and why they don't trust the other side. But the major aspects of the siege were pretty accurate.The show is made to be watched in 4 one hour sessions and it is slow enough that this is probably for the best. I would not make this a must see for anyone going to Israel though. Just a nice to see."
2,Stick with the video version,"Masada the mini-series on dvd was a waste of money for me. I have been waiting for a long time for the dvd version and when it came what a disappointment. It has no subtitles; the picture is out of focus in some spots. Streaks, flashes and dark spots appear in some of the scenes. The video version beats the dvd version by a long mile.JN"
5,"excellent,but slightly historically inaccurate","Beautifully acted all round;stunning scenery and props; the only problem I have is the portrayal of Flavius Silva as a conciliatory general, when in actual fact he was a bellicose,bloodthirsty soldier, as were most of the Roman generals and Procurators at that time. The only written record by a Jew was by Josephus, which most certainly could not be considered as entirely historically accurate, because he was living among the Romans, having defected after the siege of Jerusalem in 78 C.E. He most certainly would not have wanted to displease his Roman masters by portraying them as brutal savages(which is exactly what they were) Here endeth the lesson!"
5,Masada revisited.,"After returning from vacation and a trip to Masada, I wanted to see the DVD. The mini series was about 4 hours long and did not disappoint. The movie brought a better perspective to the visit of the ruins."
2,"Buyer, beware!","This is not the original 6-hour (minus commercials) mini-series that originally ran. This is a much-edited version, cut down to only about 2 hours. Still a half-way decent movie, but a lot of things won't make sense. And some story lines are not properly wrapped up. Example: the relationship between Silva and his captive mistress. Very disappointing, as I still remember certain scenes which are not included. Also, I've learned since 1981 that this is not an accurate portrayal of Silva, the Roman commander. Not noble, as portrayed by Peter O'Toole, just a typical bloodthirsty Roman officer.I recommend reading the recent best-selling book, ""The Dovekeepers"". More believable about the true nature of the major characters. Even the novel this movie is based on, ""The Antagonists"", by Ernest Gann, would be better. Even tho Gann is the one who originally painted the false picture of Silva."
5,Masada_the movie and the real one,"We viewed this movie after we returned from a real trip to Masada. I wish we had seen it first, but even after it was very valuable. The movie is excellent. The movie is a little dated, but the story keeps your interest and the historical details seem accurate. We really enjoyed the movie (and the trip!)"
5,Finally on DVD--worth all the years of waiting,"I remember the TV series and have been looking and wanting to buy old tapes for several years. They sold well over my ability to pay. The story is awesome and even better than I remembered. We did watch the DVD in two settings but it was hard not to just sit down and watch the entire 6 plus hours at once. The segments do a good job of review so it can be watched just as it was done on TV, on four different 90 minute viewings.Because of the story and when the event took place, this story is not dated like some other movies. The only thing I can say against the story is the fact that I ended up wishing it was 12 hours long rather than the true length. It's a bargain, tapes used to sell for over $100 used. I'll keep my copy forever and will watch it again soon."
3,"Great Roman Siege, Story Shortened Egregiously","From a Latin teacher's viewpoint, this is great to demonstrate Roman siege techniques, but as compared to the uncut version, it is sadly lacking. I find myself constantly having to fill in information gleaned from the book and uncut version to make it coherent for my students."
2,Masada Mini Epic,"Made for TV so quality is not that of a motion picture. At times the acting is not great and the effects worse.If you're seriously interested in the history, get it, if you're looking for entertainment, find something else."
3,ALMOST AS LONG AS THE SIEGE,"Having visited Masada last year, my wife and I were anxious to see this mini series on DVD which we missed in its initial TV run. While it is engrossing, thanks to the superior acting led off by Peter O'Toole and Peter Strauss, the intelligent script and marvelous sets and costumes, it runs an unnecessarily long six hours. We spent the best part of the afternoon and evening watching it from beginning to end. It is certainly worthwhile, but I'll wager a judicious editor could have trimmed two hours out of the show and no one would have been the wiser. When you already know how the story ends, it becomes a bit trying to stick around to the bitter finale."
4,Masada,My colleague and I enjoyed this DVD very much. Have watched this twice as it was so interesting.The order was a smooth and very swift transaction and delivery was excellent.
4,"Wonderful Production, but Not Enough Peter O'Toole","Having not seen this epic mini-series since it first aired, upon second viewing I was impressed with the quality of the production. Even the music (by Jerry Goldsmith) sounds epic.The story is well-told, from both sides, and I have to say I came away from multiple viewings wishing for more of Peter O'Toole's and Anthony Quayle's stories. Both men seem baffled by the intransigence of their enemy, and the Roman's failure to understand their foe lead to the tragic conclusion of this historic siege."
2,The blue guys may have a better deal,"I bought this reconditioned router a month or so ago from Amazon. I made a trip recently to my local Lowes (blue guys) and found that for slightly less than $20 more, I could buy a brand new one.Although it was clean and free if wood dust, there were obvious signs of wear and use as the base was scratched, so was the plastic body. I don't know how much abuse this router had taken before it came into my hands, but I think for 10% more, I would have purchased a brand new router.I give it 2 stars because it is a good router nevertheless."
2,Thunder In Paradise 2,"Hulk Hogan and Chris Lemmon are back as those Navy SEAL do-gooders in this sequel (well, it's actually just a 2-part series from the first season of the syndicate show). This time, they have to save their cocktail waitress friend, Kelly (played by the beautiful Carol Alt) from being forced to marry an evil General.The script is just as lame as any of the others in this pretty goofy series but you will get a kick out of some of the gags here. It doesn't get much sillier than this but there is a whole lot of action and it is appropriate for the whole family."
1,Childish. A comic strip story more than a novel,"The dinosaurs are back, they are intelligent, they have superweapons and destroy earth's armies shooting death rays from the moon. Fortunately one of the dinosaurs becomes our friend and betrays his own people. He puts a few superbombs in a dinosaur's meeting (devoted to eat alive human POW) and mankind is safe.Well, I read much better comic strip stories. If you want to read an alien invasion story as it should be, then read Niven and Pournelle's 'Footfall' !"
4,A good read,"This book is not just for kids. I am 26 and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Literary snobs might look down their long noses at it, but I thought it was fine. The author has a good sense of humor too."
1,Not Great,"This book caught my eye due to the title and premise of the story. unfortunately I didnt research much further, once I started reading it I did a little more research and found out this was put out by a Print on Demand-Self Publisher. Which would explain why the thin dialog, poorly executed plot and poor research on the the military aspects of the story got past the editor. I couldnt actually even finish it. The idea behind the story is a good one that was poorly executed."
1,Mark of the Cat: Year of the Rat,"product was received in a timely manner, but was the wrong book. they sent me the 1st book in the series when I ordered the 2nd.....the sticker on the book was even wrong. Pretty major mistake as the first book can be purchased for under a dollar and the one I ordered cost $40 something!!! I was able to send it back and got a refund pretty quickly."
2,Baby Stella carrier,Somewhat difficult for a small (2 1/2 yrs) little girl to manipulate. Found both fabric and construction to be below my expectations. I would never purchase this again for another child.
3,"Good concept, but too small","great idea, but harness for baby doll is small. Dolls with any weight to their head (ie cloth body, plastic head) fall right out of the velcro. My daughter loves it and thinks carrying her baby with her when she rides her bike is marvelous, but I spend a lot of time fixing it when it falls out. We are getting AG bitty baby for xmas and are really hoping the backpack with that is more user friendly for our 4 year old."
3,teeny backpack,"Cute backpack, but much smaller than it appears. The Stella doll BARELY fits into the straps on the carrier, which are made with the smallest pieces of velcro allowable to hold the weight of the Stella doll. The backpack itself can hold an outfit & a couple of accessories. It seems to be modeled after the A.G. bitty baby version, but is much smaller & cheaper-made. My 2 yr. old likes to wear it without Stella on board."
3,Ok smaller than I thought,The back pack is really cute and my 1 year old loved It but it is really small and I'm afraid that she will grow out of it really quick. We will keep it just need to get another bag for overnight trips to grandmas
1,Way too little for a fouryearold,"My four-year-old is average according to her doctor, but not according to this toy. It is supposed to be for a 3-12 year old, but she could barely squeeze into it. She also couldn't fit her play phone and spare outfit and play bottle for the baby in the backpack. It is too little for the stuff she wants to pack. Any 12yearold who could wear this would have a serious growth disorder. I liked the colors and the idea, it is just too, TOO little."
3,Too small!,"This is a very cute idea, and my granddaughter loves it, but Baby Stella does not fit if clothed. Also, the holder fits so low that Stella can fall out easily. This is surprising as Baby Stella is such a child-friendly doll. Perhaps a front holder would be better. I sew so I could make adjustments."
3,Very cute bag but a little small,"My daughter loves this bag! She loves to put all the baby's things in it and she thinks she is sooo cool walking around with it on her back!! But It is a struggle to get stella to stay in the carrier, it's a little small for her."
1,So small!,"This product is very small. I expected it to be larger, given the age range. It also seems very cheaply made. I wouldn't recommend it!"
3,doll carrier,I bought 2 of these for my Great Grand Daughters along with 2 Baby Stella dolls for Christmas. They loved the dolls but the back packs where a little for the girls ages 18moths and 2 1/2 years and the dolls will not fit in the carrier
3,"Good product, but not for our dolls",This carrier is only for smaller dolls. It will not carry the Bitty Baby dolls or dolls of similar size.
5,The Man and The Poetry,"Erich Kastner (Erich Kästner) is wonderfully documented in this book by Sylvia List. Chock-full of hand-written copies and retyped poems, letters, and stories as well as graphics and other artwork from all his endeavors up until the moment of his death, this book is definitely a tome to be read by all interested in Germanic studies - both academically or by reason of hobby/curiousity. Most of Kästner's clever, insightful, and often satirical poetry and storied works are amounted in this one 543-page volume. His view is a window into times before, during, and after Germany's - and the world's - heart-wrenching and tumultuous period from 1933-1945. This book focuses mainly on the World War 2 period mentioned.Whether you are fluent or beginning your journey into German, this is a must-read. Kästner's residence inside Germany as a famous literary genius is invaluable - most writers fled the country during the Nazi rise to power."
4,The Song To Put A Smile On Your Face,"The song has a good groove and lyrics to go along with it. The song has become one the most requested songs at a club and when it is played, everyone sings along and dances."
5,ethereal softness touched by delicate gloominess,"As another commented on how they are upset over this LP purchase, I felt the need to counter that. This record is a collection of simply wonderfully structured and arranged songs. All pounced and cascaded upon by a decadent softness that takes each track to a higher level. The voice is in no way girly as suggested and is far more advanced than anything The Free Design could of hoped to of written in their bubbly times. It is not a sunshine pop record by no means. Expect a record to wrap around in the late afternoon of a crisp fall day. Simply brilliant."
2,Just ok.,"Not breaking any new ground here and this singers voice taken purely on it's own merits falls short of many others recording in this genre. Tough to find on vinyl but you know what they say, records are rare for a reason."
3,"""Could've Been Better!""","Don Opper, Terrence Mann, Brad Dourif and Angela Bassettstar in this 1992 sci-fi/horror sequel. A bounty hunterhelps space salvagers stop more hungry furballs. Thisfinal installment could've been better and one of thethings I didn't like was that Terrence's character Ug,was bad. This dvd has good picture and sound, butonly trailers for all 4 films. I still recommend thisfor Critters fans."
4,The surprises and disappointments !,"PEOPLE GET READY FOR A SUPRISE! I thought Critters 4 was a very good movie but it just didn't fit with the critters movies.Now I dont want to spoil it but I am afraid I have to.Get ready!IN Critters 4 there are only 2 critters and the rest you barrely see in one part at the end.They are NOT rado active.It only shows the critters in like...4 parts and they only kill 2 people not including the troops that you didnt see dieing in the end.In part 4 Ug is so mean and he even kills some body,slaps a woman, nearly kills Charlie, Nearly kills a boy, and even hates everybody, very selfish and greedy and HATES Charlie and ervery body but himself.This part made me cry and not spaek for nearly 2 hours.This movie is great but has not enough critter action ,made Ug living hell, and does not deserve to be a critter movie.Check out some other rviews by me and they're not all bad opinions!"
3,"Ok, I was a little harsh last time.","Yeah, I'm doing another review for Critters4. It wasen't that bad, but I still think the idea of the krites(the little monsters) in outer space is a little goofy."
2,Does anyone read these reviews?,"We shall see!What do I have to say about Critters 4? Not that much, watching it on tv right now, I came in about 45 minutes late, and have only watched a few minutes now, doesn't look too promising.But how about those reviews!Can't anyone spell anymore?Apparently there isn't any editing, wonder if a review that's more a flaming of the other reviews than a real review can make it in? Yikes...Was this review helpful to you?No really, I wanna know!"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Is it over yet!ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,Boring! Come on now people all the other films took place on earth. This one should Too.
2,What have they done to the critters? this is crap! 1.5 stars,"When are they gonna learn? It is impossible to make a good space movie! lets count some of the worst ones...Leprechaun 4, Jason X, Critters 4. I have to admit Leprechaun 4 was good, Jason X was...don't even get me started with that one, and Critters 4...well it sucks! I bought this movie expecting it to be great because it was the last in the series since who knows how long, ERR WRONG! it took me about a month to watch this whole thing, it was so boring! Plus there was very little critter action, and most of the actors sucked. the only reason to buy this movie is just to have the whole collection."
2,Well... at least it's the last one.,"Isn't it a shame? This series never went the way of Gremlins. I would love to watch Gremlins 2 at Christmas-time and see Critters 2 on Easter. But we don't live in a perfect world and this shameful fourth installment is our proof! What can I say? If you're looking to complete your set this movie is a good buy. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest it."
2,I hope the rest of the Critters movies aren't this bad.,"This was the first Critters movie I ever saw, and I'm dissapointed. 53 years after Critters3, the Krites end up in outer space and wreck havoc there. The best parts are the rare cheap jokes that aren't even funny, but slightly better then the rest of the movie. The Krites in this one just look more silly then the Krites in the 1st 3 movies, I bet, because they had bald heads! MAXIMUM SILLYNESS!!!!!!!"
4,GREAT ALBUM,"Anything's Possible is yet another fine production from DC musician John Luskey, who seems to have a little more fun with Pro Tools on this album. In addition to his solid vocal melodies and vulnerable lyrics, Luskey flirts with us by employing playful effects, delectable panning, and slide riffs that hint of Beck. My only personal disappointment is that he neglected to show off his lead guitar skills, which his first album briefly alluded to. However, his rhythm chops and use of time quickly bring back the importance of good song writing. I certainly recommend purchasing this disc and following Luskey on his personal voyage of creativity, love, and musical success.A True Fan,BRAD"
4,Something a little different.,I really enjoyed this book. The way the story was told the underlying historical references and attitudes. It was a charming diversion and very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
4,Murders: A look into the past,"It is a very well written novel. It did a great job showing the view point of a 1431 convent, when scandal strikes. The plot always keep you wondering who did it even until the end! The reason all makes sense in the end and all the charaters help solve the mystery. The charaters are portrayed greatly, it is very easy to get a mental picture of them and how they act. The blend of characters is amazing, from the loudest to the most quiet, they all fit together. It is an excellent novel, that has you guessing right until the end!"
4,Mystery galore,"Thomasine is a timid ""holy"" novice. All the sisters believe her to be saintly. She wiles away her time waiting impatiently for the time she could become a full fledge nun. Thomasine's world is turned upside down when her aunt arrives unexpectedly. Thomasine dreads this visit, in which her aunt makes a point in teasing Thomasine mercilessly by threatening to take her out of the nunnery and married to a lustly fellow--something Thomasine is deathly in fear of. After only a few days after arrival, her aunt becomes ill and then dies. Unfortunately, she's poisoned and Thomasine is the number one suspect. Its then up to Sister Frevisse to solve the mystery and find out who did the horrible deed.This is an interesting mystery. I gave it only four stars because I guessed who did it immediately, although I didn't know why. It was worth reading to find out why."
4,Kept me guessing,"This book really was very exciting to read. It kept you guessing and made you wonder who really did what in the novel. It always seemed as if you knew who did what but then there's always something new popping up. It was put together very well and kept my attention very well too. After I got to chapter 5, I couldn't put the book down at all. Except there were some parts of the book that were sort of slow at times for example in the beginning it takes a while to get into but once you're in, you get hooked on it."
2,Clunky and slow,"Not much of a mystery here. The guilty party is very obvious from the start. But that wouldn't have been a problem for me if the book were very well-done. My major complaint is that it meanders and stalls and repeats endlessly. Nothing happens while the characters drive one to distraction with the tedious rehashing of all the dull facts, page after page. The writing itself is fine and the characters are mostly well-done, but quite uninteresting. Perhaps this series improves later on but this first number is well worth a pass."
3,"So far, it's okay...","I purchased this because I wanted something plain and basic to protect the outside of my phone from scratches.The shells snap on easily enough, though you may have to maneuver it around a little to get it just right. Parts of the seam stick out in several places (and I've only had this for less than a week). The belt clip works but feels a bit wobbly when snapped on (you can choose not to put it on though). The leather is a little shiny and not matte (if you're wondering).All in all, for the money, I'm satisfied enough. We'll see what happens in the coming weeks.Update: I finally took the cover off after about three months. It left scratches on my phone. My phone seems to be faring better without the cover. Oh well, it was inexpensive so I got what I paid for. If I could rate it again, I would give it two stars."
5,My daughter loved this!,My daughter is 6 years old and she spent a lot of time with this book. It was great. As for the previous review....we had no problems removing the ink from her hand. They must have waited quite a while before attempting to remove the ink. I am planning on buying the other books as well. Great idea to take to a restaurant (just remeber to bring a damp cloth in a plastic bag).
4,Good things come in small packages...,"This little book comes with a stamp pad and marker so that you can get started immediately. There are a number of cute ideas that incorporate the use of the thumb print, tip of the finger, and a few other simple lines to make interesting vignettes. There is an area on the page for practicing so you can get the hang of it. Simple fun for children as well as adults who are still little kids inside."
3,Remakes by studio artists,Was not what I expected. I should have listen to the songs first before buying. The songs are just remakes to try and sound as close to the original as possible but for me that is not what I wanted.
3,Unforgettable Performances By Lemmon and Dennis!,"A wild fast paced comedy by Neil Simon, shows him to be in top form! One of the few movies one can watch and just never get sick of. I've seen this movie dozens of times, and still think it's Simon's second best( I love ""Lost In Yonkers"")! Unforgettable acting by Lemmon and Dennis as George and Gwen Kellerman, who plan on suing the entire city of New York. At one point in the film Lemmon scream in the streets...""I have all our names and adresses! "" One mishap after another, first their plane can't land, then their luggage is missing, next, their hotel doen't hold their room! And believe it or not, but this all actually happened to Simon in real life on a trip to Boston. If you like Neil Simon, or like fast paced comedy this Simon movie is perfect for you. Oscar caliber acting by Lemmon and Dennis, who only managed to get ""Golden Globe"" nominations. And unrightly over look Simon for an Oscar nomination. One of Simon's funniest!"
4,Too Funny,"Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis are just brilliant as a Midwestern couple for whom everything (and I do mean everything) goes wrong on their brief trip to New York. What makes this film utterly hysterical are their reactions to the numerous misfortunes that befall them.It doesn't matter how many times I watch it, (and swear I won't laugh), I can't help myself."
4,Oh My God,"The lighter side of the depressed Lemmon which turned up in so many great films in the 60s and 70s. The man was a bona fide acting genius.But for my money Sandy Dennis steals the show. She glows through the rain and delays, muggings, mountains of garbage and all the rest. Somehow, through it all, with Lemmon quickly deteriorating and predicting doom around every corner, Dennis keeps some kind of suburban elegance. She makes a breakfast of Cracker-Jack after a cold wet night sleeping on the ground in Central Park look like heaven."
1,horrible not funny movie,one of the only movies I have turned off without watching the whole thing. I did not find the constant complaining and problems faced by this annoying couple at all funny. Maybe if we had stuck it out past the first half it would have gotten better but I doubt it. Skip it.
5,The Out Of Towners,A True Classic....One of the Best and Funniest movies ever made...I am so glad I own it!
5,Still an unbeaten classic,"Still a favorite movie, the story of a small-town couple trying to break into the big time in the big city. Jack Lemmon is George, seeking that big job that will launch his career and his family income to new heights. He is supported by his wife (Sandy Dennis) as they both struggle to adapt to a very different and less than friendly environment in New York city. The situations and hardships they must endure set them up for some classic Neil Simon comedy.A remake with comedic giants Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese is fair but still cannot improve on the original despite the stellar cast. In addition, the ending of the remake is not nearly as satisfying and ""right"" as the original. Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis are still the best out of towners."
4,Oh My God!!!!!!,"One reviewer said it right. Today's comedies are quite different from what they were when this marvelous gem was made. Today, in the tyranny of Hollywood accountant's bottom line orientation, producers are no longer willing to take risks and attempt to produce art. Today's video game raised generations don't have the patience for humor that is driven by great dialogue, they want the site gags and cliche ""hot babes"" - okay so it isn't all bad. However, if you are one who enjoys and even demands good writing, and good acting, this movie is calling to you. While far from Lemon's best work, it is indeed excellent.This is a tale of the Kellerman's (Lemon and Dennis) who's trip to New York evokes Murphy's Law with an attitude. This is a tale of miscalculations, bad timing, blunders, and goofs. Will our heros survive this ill fated trip? Or will the big apple devour them? Their reactions to the various situations they fall into will have you laughing."
1,"If it can go wrong, it will go wrong makes for a downright irritating, not funny, film","The Peter Principle is the main reason I avoid entering the Indian Casino down the street. This movie pits a Midwestern man (Jack Lemmon) against the Peter Principle as he travels to NY City for his big chance job interview.I am a huge Lemmon fan, but I found this movie irritating, not funny. The entire movie consists of one scene after another of, ""if it can go wrong, it will go wrong."" I can only imagine the grief this movie caused the New York Bureau of Tourism. Throughout the movie, Lemmon shares my irritation. In fact, that is his main demeanor throughout the film. He is irritated at all the bad breaks and he is constantly ranting, constantly rushing to try to overcome them. This got old for me about 8 minutes into the film and did not abate."
5,"funny,rib tickling","If you have ever had a vacation or an out of town trip go bad, you can surly relate to this and find the humor in what was probably a very nerve racking experience. Jack Lemmon makes me laugh at his reactions to all the things that can go wrong when they DO go wrong!!!!"
2,Not impressed,"I suspect the people who give movies like this such high ratings are blinded by the fact that Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis are the stars. This film did not appeal to my sense of humor. The ""amusing"" incidents are too contrived. The mishaps in the film are so continuous that after a while they become predictable."
2,Should have closed out of town,"This is one of those movies that apparently nobody has a neutral opinion on. It's either a cinematic masterpiece or a turkey. I gravitate toward the second opinion.The story, as such, concerns a couple who arrive in New York and have everything possible go wrong. It could have been funny, but Jack Lemmon- who I usually like- misses totally. Instead of being a sympathetic character, his constant bitching and whining about every misfortune becomes irritating, and eventually you don't care if anything happens to him. You almost want someone to finish him off and end the movie.Sandy Dennis, who I always considered to be an adequate- not great- actress, actually hits the marks better, and her character is much more likeable.Beware. Rent this one before you buy it."
3,The Out-of-Towners,"The product arrived in excellent condition and well ahead of the expected time. I had seen the movie when it first came out about 40 years ago. It wasn't as funny as I remembered, but it was entertaining nonetheless."
3,What I Did For Love,"This is a cute movie to buy for the women in your life. It is a ""chick flick"" that is great for date night or a gift for mom or grandma."
1,Not worth it,"Sadly, I too thought the acting was terrible and the story not that good. I will be donating this one to the Library."
1,BOOO,I love of love stories. Terrible actors. Terrible plot. Best part of movie when wolf was going to kill someone. Seriously - Don't bother w/this one. Order ANYTHING else.
3,Pleasant Viewing,"Though this movie is a bit contrived, it is humorous, clean, and ends happily. Great for when you want a chuckle and don't want to be offended by some unnecessary scene."
4,Recomended,I enjoyed very much. It was more interesting the second we watched it. The DVD arrived when it said it would. and I'm very satisfied.
5,Great Movie Night,This is a great movie.Ive seen this atleast 20 times.Its a great family movie.My friend seen it and she loved it so we got her a copy.
3,Not as bad as everyone said it is.,"I did this workout for the first time today, and only used 5 pound weights. I should have used heavier ones, as the workout is not as intense as I was expecting it to be. As for Harris, I found him hilarious. While some people may find him annoying, I thought his energy made the workout more fun. And if you'll notice, the people in his class are frequently amused by his being so over the top. I really need to know what he drinks in the morning. I'd give this video 3 1/2 stars if I could. I will use this video again, and there are some good exercises in it."
1,Good exercises spoiled by Alan Harris,"This DVD has nice set of exercises, but Alan Harris does not let you concentrate because of his ridiculous encouragements and stupid jokes. Also, video operators show Alan Harris more than the people performing exercises while he is just walking around and discourages them with his screaming voice. I am glad that I bought this DVD for just $1 at Target in the dollar isle."
5,A Compelling Visit to the World of Spirit....,"Every word in this amazing work seems to have a meaning beyond meaning. In sharing this journey towards Spirit---a journey that concludes with the author finding fulfillment and true Medicine Power Lynn V. Andrews has created a masterpiece.This book left me filled with wonder at how well each aspect of the story was created --- a magical weaving of words that entices the reader into a world far beyond ordinary. In the world of Medicine Woman we feel the power of unseen forces, meet the masters of medicine in a place where simplicity, complexity and the forces of Nature and Spirit intertwine.We come to know, understand and bond with the heroine and her supporters in this powerful story of one woman's search for Spirit and True Medicine. I highly recommend this book and look foreward to more adventures with Lynn V. Andrews."
4,ENJOYABLE READING,"THIS WAS A EASY READING, GREAT STORY THAT KEPT ME SPELL BOUND. A NICE TIE BETWEEN THE MODERN DAY WOMAN AND THE INDIAN FOLK-LORE. THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS READING ABOUT INDIAN-MEDICINE PEOPLE. THIS STORY IS ABOUT A WOMAN, A MEDICINE WOMAN, AS A WOMAN IT IS A RARE FIND TO READ A BOOK THAT IS WELL WRITTEN BY A WOMAN-ABOUT A WOMAN."
1,This is utter robbery!,"Having read this book with ever more incredulity as I turned over the pages, I realized that this author is just out there for people's hard earned money! Do not waste your time or money on this fictitious nonesense. There are so many wonderful books about shamanism and native American spirituality on the market that are for real. This is certainly not one. Just check out this woman's web site to see how she is milking the public for her own gain!"
3,"Flawed, but with good info","The woman who wrote this book used the teachings she was given without permission, the sort of behavior that gives European Americans a bad name. The book is somewhat flawed by a self-indulgent focus on herself, though the information she passes on is valuable. Please give these teachings the respect they deserve without idealizing the author."
5,FIRST HAND- she is the real deal!,"It is the 25th anniversary of this wonderous book. I have personally studied with this woman for years now. The magic described in Lynn Andrews' books is real! Don't trick yourself into being decieved by her appearance or her place of residence. Out of curiousity I read the reviews listed here. They are as varied as the different levels of awareness within human exsistence. Check it out for yourself. See what resonates within your own Soul and what doesn't- let it go with the wind. No doubt, more will go to your heart than to the wind....Imagine the courage it would take to do this journey of Spirit and then to share it with the world?Read Medicine Woman, then imagine."
4,back to nature and our life itselfe,"This is a book about a normal persons whay to a world some dont think of as normal.Lynn mets a indian woman thats start to teach her about herselfe, all woman and the nature of mother earth...It makes U wish we all had a teacher like that so that we all could se with open eyes about life and peopel....Lynns experienses with this woman is a great story even if U read it just for fun"
1,Superficial,"This book cynically jumps on the bandwagon of Castaneda's successes, but as opposed to C., the book does not succeed either as fiction or as a resource for someone who wants to learn more about shamanism. Rather, Andrews gives us a latter day version of Blavatsky's theosophy laced with an eclectic mix of Lakota, Aztec and pseudo-feminist self-improvement jabberwocky. Rather shameless, actually. I struggled to develop some sympathy for the supposedly autobiographic character, but it is so bland and so full of internal inconsistencies that i gave up. The most shocking thing about this book is the ruthlesness with which this mass consumption product is marketed towards women who seek spiritual guidance. To end on a more positive note, the books in the autobiographic genre that I would recommend include those by Timothy Knab, Martin Prechtel and Manuel Cordova-Rios. To women interested in starting their own shamanic practice I'd recommend Sandra Ingerman's Soul Retrieval."
4,Rock solid VPN connectivity to a remote site,"We've been using several of these for years now providing VPN access to our remote (low volume) sites. The CLI interface is very similar to Cisco's, and they've got great support from AdTran, as well as sample documentation on their website.My only complaint on the 3120's is that they don't have a console port for administration - you have to use SSH/telnet or the web interface. Otherwise, they're perfect for our needs."
3,"48 Golden Songs, Marzieh Volume 1, 4cd Pack","This collection (48 Golden Songs, Marzieh Volume 1, 4cd Pack) was much better than the ""Volume 2"". In fact if I knew the tracks name, I would not buy it. There are many better songs from Marzieh which were not included in either volumes. She is very much better in singing songs (specially GOLHA) than AAWAAZ (kooche baaghee). Why we were not able to see and read the tracks ?48 Golden Songs, Marzieh Volume 1, 4cd PackI hope that was not a trick. Thanks48 Golden Songs, Marzieh Volume 1, 4cd Pack"
5,What a great visual!!,"I loved reading this book, as I enjoy Lori's humor so much. But I also enjoy the life situations she always uses to teach moral truth to children. Being a visual learner, I associated well with the ""placesetting"" idea to help jog my memory for important points. Chapter 7 is a must read for any parent--cutting everyday problems into bite-size pieces. Wish I would have read something this applicable when my children were younger!"
5,A Great Book !,This was one of the first chapter books I ever read. When I saw no pictures and lots of writing I didnt think I would love it so much. After reading Ballet surprise I went on to many other michelle full house books and started mary kate and ashley. I learned to love chapter books All because of Ballet Surprise !
3,Expected more,"The event was good overall but I expected more. The sampling of music was good if your a fan and know the music but the recording itself was lackluster and at times blurred. The venue was also pretty small scale. Looked like it was recorded in a tent.However, you will enjoy the music, voice and event overall."
3,"3 & 1/2 stars, A bit proper for a Chente concert but, musically flawless","Viewers of this DVD filmed at his own ""fully dressed up"" concert venue in Guadalajara will get a slightly different impression of his legendary live shows. They are generally more raucous, booze soaked, chain smoking between every song sing along events. They are unique and uniquely Mexico.But, since this was a very exclusive event for the elite of Guadalajara and they were filming him live for (unbeleievably) the first time they kept it nice. Chente es Chente, y como Mexico no hay dos... There are a few pirate DVD's out there, sold in Wal-Mart of all places, but they are of poor sound and amatuerish editing. This one is the only one to buy that is out.Listen and watch this living legend. You will never again drink Tequila without him. This concert contains a ton of material, over 2-2.5 hours of it. In concert he can sometimes go 3 hours plus. HE HAS A TON OF MATERIAL."
4,suave,"esta bien pero si hubieran puesto mas canciones en este dvd hubiera estado mejor, pero si lo recomiendo, vale la pena"
1,Too Basic,"The book is extremely elementary and a lot of the content is pertinent to copy writing in general. I had expected more detail on how to make high tech content simple and engaging, which is the main premise of the title of the book. However this is only explored in a superficial manner in the book. In my opinion, buy the book only is you have less than a year or two of experience in the field. For more more experienced marketing practitioners, it would be a waste of money buying the book."
3,Taking on too much,"I purchased this book as a textbook for a marketing communications class. The class as a whole had a few negative comments, including that the text was difficult to follow. I had no trouble following it, but King does try to cover too much material in one book. Buy this book for an overview of copywriting and read first the chapters that pertain to your particular project (something King suggests herself). Move on to other books for a more in-depth view."
5,Most Complete Book on Marketing High Tech Products,"Copywriting that Sells High Tech is one of the most complete books on creating promotional copy for the high tech industry available on the market. It covers everything including the marketing cycle, planning process, and writing methods. It should be considered the de-facto textbook for those who create marketing copy for high tech and B2B products.The author, Janice King, writes in a friendly, informative style and tackles not only what to write, but adds things to consider such as legal and ethical situations and addressing a global, multicultural market. I highly recommend this to all product marketers, whether you are a freelance writer, agency writer, or are in corporate marketing."
2,"E for ""Everyone""...who can read","Once again the ESRB ratings show just how worthless they are. The target audience for this game is likely the three to six year old girl. Unfortunately the game involves a tremendous amount of reading, which pretty much rules out most of the target audience. I sat with my daughter for an hour playing this lame game, reading huge volumes of stilted dialogue for her. While the game requires the ability to read, the manual dexterity required of the player is minimal - boring for anyone who's spent any time around a GameBoy.Avoid this game at all costs."
5,Great buy,"Product was in great condition. It works well and it was a fun game for the kids to play, even me."
2,I should not have bought this game...,"I read the reviews beforehand. Bought it anyway. Way too hard for a non-reader. My daughter is 5, and she can read some sight words. So unless you have a prodigy reader..this game is not for your child. Even then, your child would probably not be interested in a simple game like this. This is meant for a reading child...very boring game. The Dora Around the World or the other princess game is a much better pick."
1,If I had known,This game is alright if you know how to read. I bought it for my 5 year old daughter and she is just learning to read. I do not recommend this game for children that can't read. If I knew that it required a lot of reading I would not have bought it.
3,"What, no singing?!",I don't know how this qualifies as a sound track when it includes NONE of the singing that was so prominent in the movie. This is simply Newman's orchestral score. That is fine and the several main themes are repeated and interwoven but there was singing in and over all the action. Why wasn't it included? The only singing appears in the opening and final credits. It's definitely a disappointment.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"When I ordered this CD, it was before the age of widespread Internet access. I thought I was going to get a compliation of all the beautiful songs sung in the movie (e.g. Cvm Rhondda and God Save the Queen), not just a bunch instrumental background music which is all you will find on this CD save for one measlely track, track #2."
5,Buy This Book I promise you'll Like it.,This book is one of the best I've seen in a long while. This book is worth the money you pay for it. This book completely took me in I couldn't stop. Great story and art what more can you ask for. If you want a good Crime story this is it.
3,"Great content, but size is smaller than original editions from early to mid 90s!!!","Beware, these editions are about 30% smaller size L X W"" than the original editions from early 90s that i still have to compare with. Very disappointed in smaller size; almost like watching a 70mm Star Wars epic from 77 on a tv screen--definitely not the same experience. Come on, MAN?!?"
5,That Yellow Bastard,"That Yellow Bastard is author Frank Miller's favorite Sin City title...And since he's written seven of them that means That Yellow Bastard is pretty special. Introducing new characters Hartigan and Nancy, That Yellow Bastard was adapted in the first Sin City film. The book has quite a different feel from the other Sin City novels as Hartigan is a cop who's already over the hill in age. I can't write too much but rest assured, That Yellow Bastard is a good book to add to your collection."
2,This is the only Laos grammar book on the market.,"Since this is the only Laos grammar book on the market, those of us who are interested in learning are forced to use it. The pages are not formatted well, having an amatuerish feel to the layout. The sentence diagrams are very confusing and the print is small. It takes a little extra effort to learn the language simply because the book is not formatted aesthetically. Otherwise, the grammar is fine, although it is a must to get the Lao-English Dictionary to implement what is learned in the grammar book. This book is the only game in town so we have to use it, but it needs another edition to fix the layout."
1,Lao for Beginners,"I did not like this book. Lao is a VERY simple language, but this book uses a very complex approach."
2,there are 2 books with the same name!,"There are two books 'called Lao for beginngers' and 2 books called 'Let's learn Lao'. I have not seen the Tuttle publications book. The one by Buasawan Simmala and Benjawan Poomsan Becker (Baipoon publishing 2003) has lot of audio. It has many problems, but the words in Lao are spelled correctly.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced."
2,just crumbled after 5 years,"We had an aussie grill like this, and the wood peeled after a year and after 5 the whole thing just rusted and crumpled. We kept it covered and everything."
1,Doesn't Smell Right!!,"I am sending this back, it does not smell like the perfume that I currently have had in the past. Very disapointed."
4,Adorable!,"I just bought this book for my 3.5 year old. It's darling! The intricate pop-up, hidden-behind-the-flaps, and otherwise interactive bugs are so cute, creative and clever. The only thing I would comment on is that I do think it's better for the older preschool set - a lot of the pop-up bugs are delicate and won't take much handling.I'll definitely be looking for more from this author."
2,"Great book, bad retailer","We love this book. It is very fun and excites ids to read and learn about the alphabet. I was buying a replacement for a copy I already own that had damage (typical for a pop up book). The problem is that it was listed as being in very good condition, and it had more damage than the copy I already had. Multiple pages were written on, and six of the pop ups were damaged or missing. I was very disappointed in this transaction."
5,This is the only book my son will actually look at!,"I have several of David Carters books and LOVE them. No other books will hold my 10 month old sons attention. When we finish reading all of them, he always wants to read them again. I highly recommend these books to any parent searching for something that their kids will actually look at and learn from."
3,Some good info.,"As the other review notes, History of the Moors of Spain has some very interesting facts in it, but is saddled by the Christian view of the Moors as infidels. This view is really interesting, as the Moors seem much more civilized, at least the earlier Moors, than their Christian foes.I wonder what the author would think of the view now that El Cid worked for Moors as well as Christians.The free Kindle version is 2,483 locations long. Interesting read, but be aware of the blinders worn by the author."
3,History of the Moors of Spain.,"The Moors should come alive, in this book they just moved along. It was a shame, that I ended up putting this book down and moving on."
4,"Definitely worth listening to -- disregard the ""rabid"" fans ;-)","If you like listening to an eclectic mix of mid-to-up-tempo dance music, this double album will keep you satisfied. I have not listened to too many MoS compilations, and this is the first one from the Chillout Sessions that I have in my stereo. It has become the most played album of my collection for the past several weeks. The selections are individually excellent, the grooves addictive, and the whole picture is even nicer as you don't stop in the middle and ask ""What the heck was that?"" about any of the tunes. If you are hesitant as to whether your $35 will be wasted, take it from an objective listener: try it out and you won't regret it..."
4,Some great tracks.,"I cannot agree with the other review that this CD is completely worthless, although I have not heard the other Ministry of Sound Chillout Session Volumes, this one certainly isn't as horrible as the other reviewer portrays it to be... there is a nice amount of good tracks on both CDs... although I can admit that there are also a few that are not very interesting at all. For example, I can't stop listening to tracks 1-4 and 16-20 on CD 1... but the songs in between go from not so good to pretty decent. I would definitely give this CD a chance however..."
2,Terrible Sound,"Make Way for Dionne WarwickI never thought I would find another copy of the original album, so I digitized the remains of three of the same from wax. I was naturally overjoyed when I purchased the CD. (Until I heard it) My copies sounded better than the purchased one.This is getting to be a growing problem. The ""Come To My Garden"" CD by Minnie Ripperton has the same problem only worse. That album has drop-offs and sounds warped.With all the high tech gadgets in the marketplace,the industry had better take note, Older music is sellable, but they've got to clean up their act."
1,How could they do this!!!,"This is a 5-star album with a 1-star sound quality. Usually, the record companies digitally re-master classic recordings like these from the original master tape recordings, and we get a CD with a very clean sound. Not so with this CD. The pops, crackles, and hisses on the tracks makes it very obvious that they simply copied the songs from a scratchy old vinyl LP."
5,Far exceeded my expectations - this book and its companion are must-haves for rides of ALL levels,"I LOVE this book (and its predecessor) - they FAR exceeded my expectations, and even after 18 years of formal training under instructors' guidance, I have learned so much from this wonderful book. Beginner or advanced rider, this is honestly a must-read...and I do not say that too often about books! It was a pleasant surprise to see the size of this book and its companion - they are not flimsy or overly brief in the least, but there is no superfluous content, photos or diagrams to confuse you, either. I wish there were more books around by this author!"
5,Great Refresher,"I've been riding for about 20 years now and this had some wonderful information. I've always loved to ride bareback and I knew it was great for improving balance, but it can be difficult without some kind of pad. I also think it's not that comfortable for the horse, having a person sliding against its hair growth. Everything about this book is fair to the horse and helps us humans see where we are making mistakes and how we can improve."
5,I couldn't put this book down!,"From the opening pages this book grabbed me and didn't let go. What makes this book a great read is the unique, detailed crime scene investigations and the interesting cast of characters. It really felt like I was there looking over the shoulder of the detectives as they worked through this complex mystery.This is the third book in a series, staring state police Detective ""Mac"" McAllister. In this book, Detective Mac's not only up to his ears investigating a suspicious death, that's looking more and more like a murder, but he's also struggling with feelings for his new, and very attractive female partner. If you like the kind of book that you just can't put down, this is the book for you."
1,so so bad!,"This is my first review ever, i felt that it would be important to let everyone know how bad this DVD is. I wish i knew before i bought it! When i played it it was so demotivating that i just stood there starring at the screen and realizing that this is the worse workout video i've seen in my life! he is so annoying and the video looks very unprofessional. the only thing that looks good is the cover! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS! I would give it no stars if I could."
1,SO ANNOYING,This was the WORST dvd purchase I have ever made. The guy is so IRRITATING that I could not even get through the entire workout. He over does it and his voice is just awful to have to listen to.
1,Horrible,"This instructor was terrible. He laughed at the women in the video and continually stated how he was going to hurt them with the work out. THis might be okay for men in wrestling training, but I found it unmotivating and insulting.The sound quality was poor and he barely provided any guidance. I wish I hadn't wasted my money!!"
3,Advanced Step DVD,"great dvd and step moves - but the music OH MY GOD come on, how can you ever be motivated with that?!?!?!!?"
3,????,"I put this review at 3 stars b/c I haven't purchased this DVD, but I was wondering if the people who gave it a good review might be Allen himself or Allen's friends??? It just seems that the reviews are either very bad or very good... I wouldn't purchase this DVD b/c of the bad reviews."

2,"Tasty I suppose, but very expensive","Yup, these are your basic starlight peppermints. They are overpriced though. Buying one brings the cost in at about 36 cents/ounce. Ordering even two (10 pounds), the cost is still about 30 cents/ounce. You can get the price in a lot of grocery stores and you don't have to buy so much at one time."
5,Masterful performances of works not often heard,"Marcia Hadjimarkos is little known, perhaps because she plays pianoforte and clavichord rather than conventional grand piano, but she must be considered in the top rank of classical keyboard artists. Her interpretive powers and her touch are superb. She opens worlds on the quiet little clavichord that are revelatory."
4,As Expected,"The product has been as expected. The packaging is fine, with decent description of ingredients and instructions. I've experienced no odd side effects or really any disappointment in using it. Taking as part of a general supplementation plan to improve health and sleep in particular based on vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and have noticed some improvement."
4,With two men on a boat with a knife - watch out!,"The great appeal of this ""little"" book rests on three main things. Firstly it makes first class drama - like KNIFE IN THE WATER, it has unity of time, action and place. 48 hours on a boat with a stranger and his knife - the 29 year old narrator does not know what he's let himself in for. Secondly it pays great attention to marine jargon and knows the subject of fishing. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the reader is able to follow the ebbing and flowing of the thoughts and feelings of the narrator on this emotional and philosophical journey. This novella is good enough to be used as a study text by High School literature students. Read it in one sitting and enjoy. Oh, I forgot to mention, the presentation of it by Chronicle Books, San Francisco is such that it is good to look at, touch and retain. It would make an excellent gift."
2,Good book but some bad citations,"It is a good book and I beleive as the author does. He does provide some very select information such as Jesus being Roman royality! He does fall into a common error regarding Krisna, I have read all the sacred books of the Hendoo and there is no simularity to the birth of Jesus. But this Krisna connection seems to be a common error. The Egyptian God Horus is truely a much better Proto-Christ and the author does correctly refer to Horus being called Christ from ancient Egyptian writing in stone. He puts forth a theory that Galalee was Pagan and likely Celts but he could have included a reference from ""Galilee of the Gentiles"" - Matthew 4:15. There were several references and theories that he could have proven if he would refernce the Bible. In fairness to the author he is doing something that is very difficult to do in light of the massive destruction of evidence! It is still a very good book and well worth the read."
2,This book is for novices!!!,This book was a big disappointment really had very little what i was looking for. Programs didn't work right. Loaded Gcc-pdf on the computer and that went fine but it ask for a password that was no where in the book to be found so it will not open. The book is written like it is for people that have never run a computer or been on the internet.
2,Enjoyable read but very simplistic.,"The author glosses over the computer use of applications which he recommends. A book written for this level of computer user should be written cook book style: First, perform this step; then perform this step; then . . . .PLease note that this rating applies to the book, only. I purchased it used from Discount Books and would give that vendor five stars for their service."
5,A special treat for the ears and mind,"I bought this CD because of Stefan Sanderling and the fact that I had not heard the Bruch pieces which are recorded here. Putting everything together I found the collection to be the topping on ""my Bruch cake"". What a delight! Many people do not buy things they have never heard before. I, however, have several Sanderling CDs plus having heard him conduct The Florida Orchestra and was taken over by this collection with orchestra and piano playing supportive roles. I ask anyone who has not heard much of Bruch's music to bring this CD into your home and you will feel better for having done that."
5,Un libro que da PAZ,"Este libro es excelente! Cambia totalmente el modo de ver la vida, da PAZ. El Señor ha hecho grandes maravillas con mucha gente a través de este libro. Conozco personas que estaban en una situación sumamente dificil que parecía no tener salida y al leer el libro, han salido a la LUZ y todo se resolvió por la obra del Señor! A todos los hispanoparlantes les recomiendo leer y TENER este libro, les aseguro que no se arrepentirán! Que Dios les Bendiga y les de PAZ!"
1,Green Machine,"From the ratings, I expected much more. It was well written, but provided no significant information. If you want information, skip this one."
1,Early Christianity the Way It Really Wasn't,"Banks has painted a picture of what he believes Christian life and worship were like in those earliest days after the resurrection. There was no institutional structure or authority. There was no ritual. There was little doctrine. It was, basically, the ancient Mediterranean version of going out with your buds for Sunday brunch.It's a very pretty picture. Sadly, it isn't true. Trust me, I've spent my entire adult life trying to get a grip on what authentic early Christianity was like, and it was nothing like this. If you want the real story, I'd suggest you read Wayne Meeks' 'The First Urban Christians: The Social World of the Apostle Paul', especially chapters 5 and 6. It may not be as romantic, but it's a much more satisfying story than the one Banks tells."
5,the kid,"i bought this dvd for one reason only, ""the kid""...i am not a huge fan of chaplin, for me keaton reigns supreme, however the movie ""the kid""is by far one of, if not the best work chaplin did in my opinion...at least it works for me."
3,"If you have, or suspect your have, hypothyroidism.","I tried some of this tea yesterday evening. I have been battling adrenal and hypothyroid problems and getting much better through the use of natural glandulars (Armor thyroid is natural, as is cortef) products and many supplements and healthy life choices in general. Last night and today, after the tea, I felt awful. My morning underarm temp had dropped significantly and I just feel cold in general. I have been weak and tired and shaky all day, though at first I did not know why. Should have researched more first, but like most teas oolong tea has flouride and that is bad for a hypothyroid condition. I can't guarantee the tea is the reason for the downturn, but it is something to think about if you get it and feel the same way. I am giving this product 3 stars because it came quickly, was nicely boxed and tastes fine."
1,What a lie! No lossing weight No good taste!,"This expensive tea has nothing to do w losing weight what so ever...as I start driking it w 5 other co-workers in the same time! We all have different body, diff diet and some of us were very active during consuming this tea. However no one lost a single LB! Not to mention, the taste is not that good .... very simillar to crapy Green tea!"
1,did not reciev item,"I did not receive this item. It was damaged, sent back and I did not receive another item. I am very disapointed!!!!"
3,Good tea,"I've tried wulong tea and green tea for weight loss and it does seem like wulong is better. I've also tried different wulong teas and this one was ok. The flavor was just average and I didn't feel like it had much potency (the water was a bit pale, not vibrant brite like this one3 Boxes of Wu-Long (Oolong) Premium Slimming Tea - All Natural Diet Oolong Tea , 100% Pure and the Original. I did find a reasearch report online that does say wulong is better than green tea for weight loss so I would definitely recommend wulong. I consistantly drink it every day and it helps to make me feel full when I drink it before a meal. I also read that it has great antioxident affects like anti-aging and good skin."
2,Bland and no signs of health benefits,"Company shipping the tea very fast. Fair prices. But the tea itself, just doesn't so it for me. Very bland and I see no evidence of any health benefits, namely the weight loss effects. If you want tea that tastes good...try something else."
2,"too weak,not a good taste.","This tea are very weak.Please save your money.Far as weight loss i have lost 3 pounds,but i don't know if it's because of the tea.I've been working out for the past 2 weeks."
1,Not For Me,"I have been drinking oolong teas for over 40 years, not because of any claimed health benefits, but because I enjoy the flavor - at least most of the time. After seeing how highly this tea was rated I was really disappointed with how it turned out. It has a fairly strong bitter taste, and the flavor isn't pleasant at all. If you open one of the bags you will find the tea has a sawdust consistency, no recognizable leaves at all. If you want a really good oolong at a reasonable price, I recomend the Numi ""Iron Goddess of Mercy"" loose tea."
3,Weight Loss or no Weight Loss ?,I purchased this tea to see if it would excellerate my fat and weight loss by adding this to my regimen. I have not seen any addtional benefits in that regard but it is a tasty tea and well worth the price.
4,It's good,"The verdict is still out. But I like it, I mean I like the way it tastes with a little honey."
3,Good value for money,"This reasonably priced product isn't as rich in flavour as some wuyi teas. Instead, it has a surprisingly light, flowery flavour. I liked it, but I was a slightly disappointed because I was expecting something else. Definitely seems to have an appetite-suppressing effect &, for that alone, it's worth every penny. AND... it's cheaper for 100 tea bags than any off the shelf supermarket teas."
2,"I dont know if its good, but i hate its taste","Honestly, i don't know if its good or helped me. I disliked the taste totally. I cannot drink it anymore."
5,Very good.,Tea is delicious- i like to add lemon to mine for better taste. Recommend! Tea makes me wanna go to bathroom many times during the day which i like cuz everything i eat goes out :D
5,Vintage Wuyi Oolong Tea,I love this flavor of tea and use it both as a hot beverage and as a cold beverage. This is difficult to find in grocery stores and what you find is in boxes of 20 bags. This comes in boxes of 100 at a very reasonable price. I recommend this very highly and will be purchasing this again in the future.
5,Miracle product,"Ok I don't know about anyone else but for me this product is nothing short of miraculous. The taste is OK...I make just as I would any old iced tea; by the pitcher. On occasion I drink it hot. It doesn't taste bad, doesn't taste great. The miracle is what it has done for my body! I controls my appetite and I've lost a lot of weight since drinking it. This surprises me because my life has held a lot of tragedy this year which has thrown off my workouts. I thought surely I would gain weight (adding another tragedy to the list) but I started drinking this and my clothes are fitting despite not working out as much. I hate that the shipping is so expensive but I just can't be without this stuff."
3,Always wanted to try,Always wanted to try Oolong tea so decided to buy the box of 100. I thinkthis is a very mild tea; very light in color and not heavy bodied. I washoping for the flavor that you get in the Chinese Restaurants. It wasokay but wouldn't buy again.
5,Oolong Tea is a must!,"We love the All Natural Vintage Wuyi Oolong tea, since we found out about this product a years ago we have placed 4 orders of 3 to 4 boxes per order, This tea is a must in our home. Really don't know if it helps you loose weight, but it a great tasting hot tea for morning and evening!"
5,Fantastic tea,"I was highly skeptical of the reports that said that Oolong tea helps with weight loss, but now I'm a believer. Eating healthier and eating less was helping me, but once I started drinking a cup or two of this tea each day I did notice that the weight loss was a little faster. I love this tea."
5,The TORAH for Children ~,"I purchased this item for my grandson and I must say I am very impressed with the quality of the book and explanations. I am a Baptist myself, but my daughter has chosen the Jewish faith for her son and herself and I was looking for books for them both. Coming across this book as well as several others on this site, has been a tremendous relief. The artistry as well as the read factor was exceptional. Thank you to Mr. Bereishis for his donation to the community."
3,Pretty but small,Well done in design this pendant is approximately the size of a penny in diameter. Although small the diamond cut pattern is very nicely done. I would think this pendant more of the size for a charm bracelet rather than for a pendant on a chain.Of the two peace pendants the other offer is more impressive due to its size and it isn't flat but convex in design which lends more visual interest.
5,Um bom livro de consulta,"Um bom livro de consulta, um bom livro para estudo sistematizado de microbiologia."
1,Great performance - terrible mastering,"Avoid this mastering of the famous 1952 RAI recital like the plague - terrible sound. The strange thing is that EMI already issued the 1952 RAI recital in its 1997 2-CD ""Live in Concert"" from a far superior source. Buy that one instead."
3,"Amazing recital, but...","I recommend you seek out a previous EMI album entitled ""Maria Callas: Live in Concert"", since it feautures this same recital, but in much superior sound (no doubt from a different source), thus making the experience all that more enjoyable. As to the performances themselves, they really need to be heard to be believed (and in that sense I give them 5 stars, I take 2 from this release because the source EMI chose isn't as good as the one of their previous release). This also goes for ""Live in Milan/Athens"". Though not all of the items featured in that disc are actually in ""Live in Concert"", I'd still recommend the latter for the same reasons stated above."
1,this is the worst game that I have ever seen,"this game is horrible. I don't what what kind of drugs the game's developers used to make this. It is simplyly bad. Its story is horrible, the graphics are horrible, and everything in this game is horrible. there are stupid monsters for you to kill, and lots of spiders to kill. i bought thus gamee thinking it was a King Arthur's cool adventure, but this game is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad. please don't buy this game. save your own life. please."
3,"Not bad, but...","...about half way through this book I started to realize it's more a collection of stories intended to give this disorder a context for readers, rather than concise descriptions of what the disorder is and how to treat it. That said I'm sure many men recognize themselves in the stories and thus hopefully get some help or help themselves somehow. Worth reading..."
4,A Step onto a Secret Path,"when I found this book, I had already been working on the problem which the book discusses. But, as the book reveals, it is not easy for most men to do this work, in comparison with most women, and in particular it is difficult to find relevant reading material. At one point, I began to draft a plan for a book on this subject myself, since I saw a need that was not being fulfilled. While this book is very good, I do believe that a need exists for more material on this important subject, and can only hope that qualified writers/agents/publishers are working on new material aimed at awakening awareness of this subject."
2,Disppointed,"This is a difficult read, its mostly composites and difficult to glean any real clinical information. Admittedly i haven't gotten though the entire book yet. Unmasking Male Depression is much better for clinical information, if you can stomach being preached at."
1,Not that great,The author spends most of the time excorcizing (sp) his personal demons. The rest he spends with severe case studies.Try something else.
3,Very insightful and relevant.,"I found this book to be very informative and relevant to the inner mind set of many men. It helped me to understand my own feelings and the reasons why other men, I know, act the way they do. Some of the abuses were extreme and not related to me or anyone I know but still they were of interest. I must say that this was not an easy read mainly due to some of the words the author used which I had to research"
5,An amazing read....,This book provides an enlightening look at masculinity and the myths and stereotypes we all face as men. It becomes real as Terrence Real describes actual therapeutic experiences and compares them with his own life. I enjoyed this book..
3,If I had a hammer...,"Reading this book, I'm reminded of the saying that if you are a hammer, the whole world is a nail. I think that's how the author approaches men's problems. Everything wrong with men is depression. I also had a problem with his lack of emotional differences between men and women. We are different. The book does shed some light on depression, and does encourage men to do more than to stuff emotions. But being a man is more than simply opening up emotionally. I don't criticize lightly. I was suicidally depressed at one point."
4,Helped my marriage,"I was in therapy without my husband, afraid my marriage was falling apart. My therapist recommended this book, and while it didn't change my life, it certainly helped. I read it first, then I asked my husband to read it. I understand him better, and he understands his father better. Understanding is the first step to better communication. I recommend this to any woman who suddenly finds her husband is suddenly no longer the ""man I married."" By the way, we're at ten years married and going strong!"
5,I Get It Now!,"I think everyone should read this book! I liked it the most for it's straightforward, no self-pity, no talk-show-tears approach. Terrence reveals the hidden vulnerablities of men with dignity and self respect. He taught me(a woman)a lot about how men are forced to live in this society, and how they are denied their humaness in ways we women could never fully understand.But he never stripped his subjects of their masculinity. Instead he gave it back to them by showing us the whole man in every story. I respect that, and I respect the men in his book for their strength in the midst of their own individual hells.I found this book to be hopeful and strangely uplifting. No man(or woman)should be afraid to read it!"
2,Overcoming? Not Quite,"This was a very well written book, and has plenty to sympathize with. The portions about forced male gender roles contributing to ongoing inner turmoil isn't bad, though i'm not entirely convinced that's a major contributing factor to male depression.The big problem here is: THIS IS NOT A SELF HELP BOOK. The title is ""overcoming"" male depression, but the author does not lay out a game plan. What he tells you, you've already been told: Go find a shrink. Great. So much for saving thousands of dollars on years of therapy on a do-it-yourself approach."
3,has some interesting points,"This book was recommended to me. It presents the argument that depression in men is different than depression in women. It is helpful, but the author seems tio believe all men are really knuckle-dragging apes. Several stories from the book are helpful in that men are encouraged to see how they treat others and to imagine feelings of other people. Book could have been much better."
3,"No ""Carrot Stew"" song included on CD","The original cassette tape included the wonderful song ""Carrot Stew"" which was what really made the story so fabulous. Unfortunately, the CD does not have the song on it. What a shame. The song is so cute that we still sing it after 26 years! Someone needs to put it back in!! The fact that the song is not included should have been put in the product description. The book itself is great, but with the song, it's wonderful."
2,Proceed with caution,"I have adored BJ Thomas's remarkable baritone since I was a kid, falling in love with it first with the 1970 smash ""I Just Can't Help Believing""--released after the runaway success of ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"", Burt Bacharach's sprightly, award-winning ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" theme-- and then again with the mellow, melodic follow-up, ""Most of All"".Mr. Thomas is still in fine voice here, but potential buyers should be aware that these are re-recordings of his best and best-loved songs, not the originals.If you don't mind that, this comp is a good enough bang for your buck but if, like me, you prefer his peerless original recordings look elsewhere."
3,Plugs YOU up!,"I don't know what is in this pill, but it won't make you regular! I couldn't takethem anymore, without lots of distress on the toilet bowel! I would suggestsomething else."
5,Genisten review,"Yes, I recommend Genisten for who needs more energy. It's unbelievable the way how it works!!! WONDERFUL!!!"
1,not much of a review,"I cannot review or rate this product as I am unable to tell if it is effective or not. I take this at the suggestion of a physician whose opinion I respect, but he doesn't really know if it is effective or not, either."
4,A Fantastic Introduction to the Topic,"Dolman admits at the outset that this book was written not to break new ground, but instead to summarize simply all the wisdom of the centuries. This book is designed primarily for use as a textbook for a course on public speaking, and several of Dolman's chapters exhibit the wisdom that he's gained from years of teaching the subject.Dolman points out many misconceptions and many failures that creep up on all speakers, whether novices or seasoned experts. I found the chapters on purpose and on organization to be the most helpful, although I enjoyed the chapter on how to insert humor appropriately into speeches.This book is best for those wanting the basics on speaking, because you will not find a new revelation within these pages. But I have no criticisms at all and wholeheartedly recommend this book for those wanting a systematic introduction to public speaking."
1,Not the Item Pictured,"This is a pack of 3 GENERIC replacements that are thin and round with a hook on the end - NOT shaped to fit into the cover of the Journada, and certainly NOT the ITEM PICTURED in the ad (as of today, 3/13/03). Although what I received is a functional PDA stylus, they are thin and easily broken (good thing I got 3 in the pack). This is the most disappointing item I've ever purchased through Amazon.com."
3,Cool when complete,I would not suggest this kit for anyone under the age of 14 or so. I assembled it and struggled with the directions/pictures. It looks very close to the pic when assembled.
4,"Tom Clancy, Move Over!","One doesn't think of government cover ups and covert military operations at the Jersey Shore. But this book makes it seem believable. The story takes place near Atlantic City and in the ocean off the Jersey coast. The characters are real. You actually care about them. And one of the main characters is a dolphin. It's not some monster. It's a being with thoughts and emotions. The people have their faults and flaws but they struggle to decide what's the best course of action.This book had mystery, science, and action. The author obviously did a lot of research. And it all comes together in the last few pages. Wow!I hope Swain writes another book!"
5,Kuryakyn Scythe Mirrors,I purchased these mirrors for my 09 Fat Bob and am 100% satisfied with them. They look incredible giving my bike some extra styling. They do vibrate at certain RPM's but it does not bother me at all. Great product!
1,Chrome finish defects!!!,Received the mirrors on time but the right mirror had chrome defects!! where is the QC?!!I wouldn't reccomend buying it if you are reshipping it overseas because the cost or returning it is the same cost of buying a new one!!
3,C'est bien,La qualité est bonne garde son ajustement et donne un beaux look au Bike.Le seule problème c'est les angle de la base qui son fait pour guidon droit.
5,Essays by Reader-Response theorists,"Jane Tompkins came out with the first edition of this book in 1980 and, nearly thirty years later, her book remains a good collection of essays by reader-response theorists. An Introduction by Jane Tompkins situates the essays within literary theory.Reader response rose out of New Criticism, whose history is conveyed by contributer Walker Gibson. Gibson's chapter is accompanied by chapters written by Gerald Prince and Jonathan Culler (structuralism), Michael Riffaterre (stylistics), a translation of Georges Poulet by Catherine and Richard Macksey (phenomenology), Wolfgang Iser (phenomenology), Stanley Fish (phenomenology), Norman Holland (psychoanlytic), and Walter Benn Michaels (poststructuralist). A concluding chapter by Jane Tompkins reminds the reader of the changing shape of literary response.An annotated bibliography nicely concludes this helpful collection of reader-response critical theory."
1,Absolutely Horrible!!!,"I have never written a review for a book or a DVD before, but I feel compelled to do so now. This is absolutely the worst DVD I have ever purchased! I actually thought it was a joke at first. After reviewing the first 15 minutes, I actually took it out of the DVD player and resisted the urge to throw it in the garbage. The instructor, Alan Harris, is rhythmically-challenged and unbearably obnoxious (if you can believe it, he comes right up to the camera and yells). He was off beat so many times I stopped counting. The choreography is boring and uninspiring. The production quality is laughable and clearly the work of amateurs. I just tried calling the production company, M2K, to complain. Now that I've opened the DVD I can't return it, so I'm going to let everyone know how horrible this DVD is."
1,"Premium price, budget workout","The GOOD points:This dvd is NOT region encoded so will play on any player (I confirmed this with M2-K). It has a 14 min 'how to step' section then a 40 min workout. The workout does make you sweat so it is effective but...The BAD points:The dvd is not programmable ie. it is a block 40 min workout, you can't skip/repeat sections. The camera work/angles are very amateurish, too many people in the room, participants use the same arm movements thru entire workout (although Alan does say to invent your own) and Alan is annoying in the way he constantly stops leading the class and runs around the room.For the price I expected a professional workout and was disappointed - it is a budget production and workout at best."
1,spend a little more,Spend a little more money and get a different Step Dvd.I had to force myself to go to the end of the workout.His attitude and showmanship was horrible.
4,Good,"I actually think it is a great workout, to add to your other gym routines. It makes you sweat alot at the end.. You can add more height to the step and it will make it more challenging. The instructor is pretty yelling but also funny. I think it is a good video. And it helps me alot, of course while adding other routines too."
3,Good player ...?,"the player itself is pretty good for the price, but the USB cable does not get recognized by the computer easily. I had to try many times to get it to work properly, I even tried it with 3 different laptops.Right now, I have a new laptop and I still can't get it to charge... It could be a deffective cable but I am not sure."
4,Doesn't hold a candle to the ipod,"This mp3 player is Samsung's answer to the ipod, however, it falls a bit short of the mark. The price is great but there are a few drawbacks. The battery doesn't seem to last nearly as long as the ipod's, the cable doesn't like to stay plugged in, and the software isn't as intuitive or user friendly as itunes.This product earns 4 stars, though, mainly for the bargain price and the fact that it is actually a good mp3 player. Just not as good as the ipod."
5,Good stuff,Searched for a non ipod mp3 player and found that samsungs had the best sound. Product works great and I am very happy. This is my first mp3 that I bought. i had other samsungs which were older and I still love the way they sound.
5,happy with purchase,"Our public library requires windows operated MP3 Player. So there was only a few different choices. I have been extremely happy with my purchase for the purpose I bought it for. I put a book on it. The ""keys"" are flat and covered with the case, so there is no concern of getting gummed up keys. It is easy to bump a key and have it do something not wanted. So once I start listening to the book, I lock the keys, so I don't bump them. I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Great little player!,I did some reasearch and finally selected this item for my new mp3 player. I didn't need anything too fancy and I wanted something that had drag-and-drop options (I didn't want to load or use new music software). I also wanted something with an FM player. I've had no problems with the player - it's very easy to use. The touch buttons can be a little 'touchy' and I would recommend a case. But so far I've had absolutely no problems and am really enjoying it. The battery lasts a long time!
3,Good but flawed,"Pros+Durable-After 3 years, it still works perfectly even though I've dropped it and got water on it. There are lots of scratches on the back where the paint has chipped off.+Battery Life-You can listen for 20+ hours and charge it back to full within 2 hours.+Features-It has music, radio, and can store pictures (doesn't include camera). You have different sound settings for music such as bass, voice, and 3D sound.+Portable-Thin, low weight, and slips easily into your pocket.Cons-Touch based-Often, you'll press the wrong button since the touch based interface is so sensitive. Hard to use while driving or if its in your coat pocket since you have to look at which button you're pressing.-Buggy-Can't create playlists. Songs are sometimes out of order. Clock for the mp3 doesn't update while you have it turned off. The music manager software that comes with the mp3 is hard to use and buggy."
3,Good Book,the book was very good The content was right what i expected from it on Active X and VB. the sample programs featured were also to the point and useful
1,Don't do it!,Most of the book is about the VB IDE and a lot of the rest is about standard VB code. The sample controls are simplistic. You'd be better off using the online help and code samples that come with VB5.
2,Not one of the better Active-X books,The authors weren't sure WHO they were writing this book for. If you are a VB programmer who wants to learn Active-X you'll be disappointed to find that half of this book reviews VB topics - and if you aren't a VB programmer you'll be really disappointed because the VB coverage is poorly written.Did anyone edit this book? The first Active-X example has two typos and an incorrect illustration.
5,Fantastic book,"This is my favorite book on health, and I strongly recommend it to anyone wishing to improve their health in a effective and natural way. Its superbly written, and you have a hard time putting it down. Its a easy read and you will feel like implementing it right away. And it works!!! I have used it for everything from curing colds fast to loosing weight. My parents have received a copy for lowering cholesterol and blood presure ...in the natural way!"
3,Just One Problem!,"There's only one problem, the wire on each end of the resistor is simply too thin. Its about one third the thickness I've bought before from other places. Just beware if you're looking for a heavier wire."
5,"Daily, thought provoking inspiration.","This is a beautiful high quality calendar. The daily Hugh Prather quotes consistently start my day with a thoughtful moment. The artwork is inspiring and the materials give it a feel of lasting quality and durability. Since it is a perpetual calendar, it can be used year after year. It also has made an excellent gift choice for my family and friends."
4,Too religious,Wanted something that said practical phrases that inspire daily living..A little too much religion...for me needed more life experiences explored...
2,Not that great,As I read these each day (now one month's worth) I am unimpressed. They are statements that I don't feel are inspiring. Someone else may like it but I am ready to put it away as soon as I receive my new calendar.
5,Ladd perfect in the title role,"If you've read the novel by Jack Schaefer on which this movie is based (and if you haven't, you should remedy that situation!), you know that Alan Ladd doesn't really match the description of Shane that's in the book. Not in appearance, or in dress. Nevertheless, Ladd is perfect in the role.As others have pointed out, Shane is an enigma. We know he's a gunfighter running away from his past. Does that mean he used to take the kind of jobs for which Ryker hired Wilson? If so, how did such a decent man ever get into that kind of work? (Note Shane's face when he first meets Joey and smiles down at him. It perfectly captures the gentleness and kindness of the character. A powerful contrast with the sneering smile of Jack Palance's Wilson. Two men of completely opposite character and principles -- yet they somehow ended up in the same profession).A truly great movie, based on a great book."
5,Great,This movie is what made Ladd a star.The story was real as were the people.I would recommand the movie to anyone who likes great movies.This film is a (CLASSIC)
5,There never was a hero like Shane,"""Shane,"" a true cinematic treasure, earned six Oscar nominations, attracted audiences not usually interested in westerns, and earned star Alan Ladd (pictured)) a special place among movie heroes.But from the opening scene to the last fade-out, this picture belongs to child star Brandon Dewilde. He speaks for every small boy who ever gave his heart to a western hero.What small boy wouldn't want a hero like Shane?"
5,Greatness,It's a shame that more people don't take the time to see this movie. Anybody with ambitions to succeed in the entertainment industry could take something away from watching it over and over.
2,Two stars. One for each time it put me to sleep.,"Don't get me wrong, folks ,I am A HUGE fan of classic Westerns! This one, it just doesn't make it for me. Don't even get me started about Alan Ladd's ""tough but gentle"" potrayal of Shane. Ladd is unconvincing to this reviewer not only in the tough guy category, but his dramatic side is very, very ""Ward Cleaver."" AND THAT KID!!! That blasted kid. Joey, played by Brandon De Wilde. Good gawd, if he wasn't the most annoying little snot that came out of Hollywood. (before the debut of Pauly Shore) ""Shane, are you gonna shoot that man? ""Shane, are you gonna let me look through your Playboys?"" I spent half the film (before I fell asleep) hoping Shane would say, ""Come here, Joey, and help me change the wheel on this stagecoach"" and have a little ""accident."" Joey's absence from the second half of this movie MAY have kept me awake. (but I doubt it.)"
1,Nice scenery,Scenery was nice even considering the age of the film made it fuzzy.Movie was boring in the max. Was there a plot here? Acting was average.Sorry I have to rate a film this low when most have rated it much higher. I must be honest.Sorry I spent the money......
1,A Biased and Distorted Attack on Free Enterprise,"Anyone who knows the American West, as I do, knows full well that Ranching made these lands, not farmable except for a truck farm here and there, what they are today. The people behind this movie, and for ought I know the book which I have not read, have made a direct attack on ranchers, who have historically been manly and forceful men, but not immoral or lawless, as this movie Shane would have you believe. Why they choose to portray us this way, I do not know, but I do know that Hollywood was always full of Communists and I think it is possible that this circumstance has something to do with the false picture of a way of life that nobody needs to be ashamed of."
1,Skip the Film,"Disney presents Shane in panoramic Technicolor! Ugh. How could they have turned such a brilliant, to the point novel into this movie? Shane fans, new and old alike, please avoid this film, which is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. What a shame is Shane."
5,Shane,"I received the DVD, Shane, in excellent timing and condition. I will most certaintly be ordering from you again. I like your professionalism."
3,Who prices these movies???,"$28!!! Come on. I liked it and all, but come on. That's beyond ludicrous. Just on price alone I'd recommend not to buy it. Just wait for it on one of the cable movie channels or get it on Netflix."
4,A classic western,"This was a classic western in its day (1953), with a plot that has since been reworked many times with variations. The eponymous star is Alan Ladd, a drifter who happens on a homestead occupied by Van Heflin, his wife Mary (Jean Arthur) and son Joey. Local cattle barons, the Ryker Brothers, are trying to evict Heflin and other homesteaders to have the whole range for themselves to raise beef cattle. Inevitably, the confrontation becomes violent. The Rykers hire themselves a gunslinger, Jack Palance, to get the job done but they hadn't reckoned on Shane joining in with the homesteaders. The photography set against the Rocky Mountains was breathtaking. The film, nearly two hours in length, was produced and directed by George Stevens and was based on a story by Jack Shaefer. The background music was composed by Victor Young."
3,aspect ratio confusion,"SHANE is a great film, but this DVD doesn't quite present it correctly. Paramount released SHANE in 1953. Its intended projection aspect ratio was 1.66:1 (coincidentally the European widescreen cinema aspect ratio; and, very close to our current video favorite, 16:9). Check out this article: http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/evolution.htmI haven't watched this DVD carefully enough (I don't enjoy the crop-job, and prefer my memory of seeing it in the theatre) to determine if it was panned/scanned or centered to eliminate edge material, but it definitely does not present the film in the aspect ratio intended for cinema projection in 1953.This is a greater shame, because SHANE was at the vanguard pushing cinema screens to the wider ratios we enjoy today."
5,"ONE OF, IF NOT THE ULTIMATE WESTERN MOVIE","I guess if all that you're looking for in a Western movie is great acting, a flawless script, fabulous photography, a tremendous music score, and an overall standard-setting film, then this is it. Between Alan Ladd, Jack Palance, and the rest of the cast, down to the dog, there is little, or no room for improvement. This became the yardstick for Westerns for decades. See it.Tony Horowitz[...]"
4,Shane,It is great to know there is a place where you can find hard-to-find movies. Shane is one of my favorite movies. I made the mistake to lend the copy I owned before and had a lot of trouble to find this new copy. Thank you.
5,LADD'S IMMORTAL CLASSIC WESTERN,"A masterpiece of simplicity, this picture practically stands as a legend among films. Rather than avoiding the cliches, platitudes and stereotypes of the Western genre, ""SHANE"" EMBRACES them; everything in the film favours its treatment as a myth (and it became a cult classic for the very reason that it worked beautifully!) SHANE was made in 1953 and today it can still be counted as a national treasure! A classic, flawless western has Ladd cast as a retired gunfighter who comes to the aid of a homestead family who are threatened by a land baron and his hired gun. The mystery man becomes young DeWilde's idol (the boy's haunting cry S-H-AANNNE! was legendary stuff throughout the fifties). The Pulitzer Prize winning novelist A.B. Guthrie, Jr. adapted the screenplay from the novel by Jack Schaefer; at 117 minutes, it's longer than many realize or remember, but definitely worth every minute of the viewer's time! Arthur's last film; she died in 1990 at the age of 89."
3,Good Job,I ordered this for my dad. I'm from Sri Lanka. Amazon informed me that it will take 2-3 weeks for the package to be shipped but I got it within a week.Very impressed.
3,"Sadly, misreprsenting the already average book...","When I read Schaefer's novel, titled Shane of course, I found some lackluster plot issues. Yet when this movie was adapted I found that the filmmakers ended up cutting up even more of the plot, and thus took away the true understanding of the book so well.For example, the name changes are okay, but when one cannot truly sense or believe the near deification that the Starretts make of Shane, then one cannot truly understand the story. So I understand that the movie had to be changed, but this is one such movie that, to be good, would have had to have an almost complete makeover from the book, as opposed to a partial dressing.So if you are a fan of the book, then the movie's blatant absences might disturb you, but repeatedly people have seemed to ignore that, so if you are willing to, then I guess you will truly enjoy this only decent film."
1,Shane,"The copy was very poorly made, too dark, can not see the picture at all. I rather have a VHS with black and white, old fashion, I'm very disappionted.Yinnie"
1,Shane,Can't review because the movie I bought had to be returned for replacement. When we put the movie in the DVD it said that the movie was not playable in the USA. Sad
5,One of the all-time great Westerns,"""Shane"" is deservedly known as one of the great Westerns.""Shane"" is the story of a gunfighter who comes to the aid of a family of settlers who are being persecuted by free-rangers. There a many allusions to Christ in the character of Shane - his sensitivity, his serenity, his humbleness, his restraint, his self-sacrifice, even the fact he is only ever referred to by one name.Shane is perfectly played by Alan Ladd matched by Brandon de Wilde as the young boy Joey who idolizes Shane, and Jack Palance is appropriately sinister as the ""bad guy"".""Shane"" is superbly staged and shot with great use of foreground and background shot compositions particularly in the bar-room sequences - and who can forget the final sequence. This film more that any other mythologizes the Western. A stunning achievement by director George Stevens."
5,A Treasure,"This Really is One of the Best Films Produced By American Cinema, Just the Look of the Production is enough to warrant Attention but the story grips from the first frame. Alan Ladd excels as the Errant Gunman, Juxtaposing with Van Heflins Solid Famer and Walter ""Jack"" Palances Gun Fighter. This Production is Class from start to Finish."
5,Shane looks fantastic on dvd.,I am amazed at the picture quality of this dvd which looks very clean and clear considering its age of nearly 50 years. I am glad owning it on dvd. This is one of my most favorite movies of all-time.
5,good movie,This is one of my brother's favorite movies -- he really enjoys it and I was happy to see it offered for purchase for him.
5,FANTASTIC,"I love this movie and consider it to be one of my all time favorites. Alan Ladd is always terrific in every movie he is in. I loved the story line and he was great as a gun slinger in his indian style clothes. I love Van Heflin too, he was always a wonderful actor and played the part of the homesteader very well, he is a dynamic actor in any part he plays. Its always good to see the bully's get their comeuppence. And Shane made it happen. I just wish the ending could have left him there starting a better life than the one he had always lived."
5,Great Purchase,My 15 year old son put the grill together while I was as work. The grill has a very even heat distribution and very good heating controls. I have cooked steak at high temperatures and chicken at low temperatures. All items have come out great so far.The stainless steel cooking surfaces and internal parts appear like they will last along time. My last Weber grill lasted for about 12 years. I expect that this one will do as well or better.My only disappointment was that this grill did not come configured for quick-connects like the last grill did. It uses the standard screw type connection for the gas bottle.
2,"Amazon's Great, Weber was a disappointment","I ordered it on 12/23 and received it on 12/28 (today) w/ the one cent shipping option. Every place it was soldered and press welded was rusty and a couple of the leg pieces appeared as if they had been heat discolored. For a $700 grill, I expected quality stainless steel w/o flaws, particularly w/o rust. On a positive note, the pieces fit together fairly well and it was easy to assemble. For the body quality, it should have been half this price. I plan to contact Weber tomorrow and voice the same complaints. Unfortunately I had not viewed this exact model prior to purchase; instead relying on the 6770001 reviews and another more expensive model I had seen at a local store."
3,Looks Great!,"After a couple years of normal use the insides (where the grease from steaks, burgers, and such) just rusted and fell out. The temp. gauge only lasted one year. My old grill of 5 or 6 years still worked fine when I purchased this one. I paid $125.00 for it and around $700.00 for the Weber. Maybe I just got a lemon because from reading the reviews most people seem to love Webers. Make sure you push down before you turn any of the burners because they are very easy to strip. I would like to hear from someone that has used this model for two years or longer."
1,these styli don't belong to a Visor Edge,The correct visor edge styli are made of metal. Their weight and balance are amoung the reasons this pda remains so popular. Their shape is nothing like what is pictured here. They come in packs of two.THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT STYLUS FOR YOUR VISOR EDGE!!!!!!
4,"Great DVD, not enough episodes","I love this DVD. It has great special features, the episodes included deleted scenes, etc. The only downfall is the fact that there are only two episodes and I have to wait another month for the next two."
4,"A must have, but...","This series is great! It's exciting, visually stimulating, special effects are spectacular, and more. For a television production it will draw any sci-fi fan. The illustrious esthetics and good storylines will keep you wanting more. I have only rated this a 4 (four) due to the poor options and operations of the DVD. It starts out with advertisements, which you shouldn't need to be forced to watch on a DVD that you purchase. If you put on pause, the sound synchronization is lost until you play around with the fast-forward or back. The price seems steep for only two episodes. I also found other glitches in the menu operations. It would be nice to have a better menu, where you do not have to hunt for the episode that you want to watch. Even with the poor DVD production the show is good enough to add to your collection."
3,episodes should be bundled. adv films sucks.,adv films specializes in distributing anime. the convention in anime is to sell 2 episodes per disc for $25...with no bundling. unfortunately they carried that pricing structure over to farscape.
3,Deaf? Don't bother! UPDATED!!,"I'll make this short and sweet. This DVD is not closed caption encoded and lacks the subtitle option as well.UPDATES: I contacted the distributor of this DVD and the VERY polite customer service person who responded informed me that this DVD does have the subtitle option. Unfortunately this option isn't listed on the menu of the DVD and can only be accessed via the ""Subtitle"" button on the DVD player remote."
5,A must buy for the serious horseman,An excellent presentation of the elements of balance in the horse's movement at various gaits. The illustrations (Did Ms Harris do them?) are grand and support the text very well. It is an excellent resource.
2,The Tokyo RIP OFF,"In Flames is my favororite band. They are totally awsome, and I think everyone of their cds are a masterpiece. But Tokyo Showdowns sound quality is terrible, the vocals sound like he's singing into a card board box. The guitars sound bad too, do not buy this bootleg sounding cd.You will only be disappointed. But if you want to see them tear it up live, go to their next Milwaukee,Wisconsin show. Cause last was brutal!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,The Tokyo RIP OFF,"In Flames is my favororite band. They are totally awsome, and I think everyone of their cds are a masterpiece. But Tokyo Showdowns sound quality is terrible, the vocals sound like he's singing into a card board box. The guitars sound bad too, do not buy this bootleg sounding cd.You will only be disappointed. ..."
2,What Happened?,"I'm not sure what happened with In Flames on this release, but they are definitely not at their best. I've seen them live, personally, and they can rock out like none other. This album doesn't even come close to capturing that experience. Poor production ruins it for the entire CD. In Flames, themselves, seem dull and mundane on this album. Save your money and go see them live."
5,Excellent protrait of life in Havana today.,This is a view of life in Havana as seen through the eyes of a young 'habanero' who expresses the problems and concerns of his generation. Excellent.
4,Looks good and works well,"My main complaint about this toaster oven is the finish. The description said it is ""brushed"" stainless, and technically it is. But there are very few brush strokes and it has more of a chrome look. I purchased this one because I wanted it to match my newly renovated kitchen with stainless appliances. It looks better than the white one I had, but not what I had in mind. It works well, though I do miss the built in timer my other toaster oven had. Also, it doesn't have a broil function. Definitely a space saver having the regular toaster built in though."
5,Book,I bought this book as a gift for a friend. She was very pleased. It was exactly what she wanted.
3,Bit Of A Snoozer,"Although extremely well written, the point of these stories escapes me. And this coming from someone who has a fair familiarity with and appreciation for Japanese literature. Despite the book's short length, it took me several weeks to get through it -- my interest and intellectual curiosity were never truly aroused. I was particularly dismayed by the stories' endings, which struck me as rather arbitrary and gratuitously abrupt. To be sure, it is nowhere written in stone that a story must always provide some sort of resolution. That doesn't mean, however, that it should end more or less in mid-sentence -- and with a 'ho-hum' from the reader."
5,OHHHHHHHHHH YEAH!!!!!!!,"I've waited and waited for the new Mesh album. When you have as much anticipation as I have about an album, its usually a dissapointment. But OH NO, Mesh has put out what has to be the best album yet."
2,An alright moie!,"I dont think kickboxer 3 is as good as kickboxer 1 & 2, but it is alright. I think there needs to be more fights, and less gun shooting. I mean Sasha Mitchell is a kickboxer not a gun fighter. That is what makes this movie look fake."
3,Almost better than the first...,"Sasha Mitchell is back and this time we get a better plot, better humor, and better fight scenes. David Sloan (Mitchell) and trainer Xian (Dennis Chan) are in Rio for an exhibition charity match, and then a championship match. They brefriend two homeless kids and become entangled in a web of crime. Entertaining if you like martial-arts flicks, which I do. I had some fun watching this one and was left smiling, though unchanged by the movie. I first saw this flick during a ""Kickboxer"" marathon. I had no clue what was in store for me in ""Kickboxer 4."""
1,Does not even compare to the first two Kickboxer Movies,"I did not like this movie at all. The fight scenes were minimal, and I have a hard time picturing Uncle Xien with a machine gun in hand. I have not seen the fourth Kickboxer yet, but if it is anything like this one, it will not be very good. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for the same action as they saw in the first two installments of Kickboxer."
3,Colorwave has changed,"I ordered four accent plates to go with eight I had previously purchased elsewhere. The dishes were well packed and arrived safely. Although the satin design on the plates was a match, I was surprised to find that the matte graphite side was also satin finished. While this was not sufficient to make me return the items, it might be a concern for some people. Does this represent a change in the pattern or a lack of quality control? Has anyone else had this experience?"
5,PERFECT RANDOM BUY,"I was perusing some new music out of sheer boredom, and I'm much a fan of bands that have some bite to their lyrics and their melodic choices. I'm not a huge fan of 'pop' rock, and so I've been really jaded with a lot of music that's out these days. HOWEVER, S.C. caught my eye - checked out their website ... and listened to the first song on the cd, ""Free,"" and I was completely hooked. It's the first time I've heard a band IN A LONG TIME that gets better with every listen. It's the kind of band that has the ability to get in your veins. It's the Coldplay/Dave Matthews talent of the mainstream...maybe now the radio won't make me cringe. Amazing debut. 5 STARS."
3,European Conquest of Africa.,"This is a nice scholarly review of the conquest of Africa. This book is more for the college student studying this event than the lay reader. Professor Vandervort breaks down the European conquest of Africa into three phases: 1.) Shifting Balance 1830-80 2.) Flood Tide 1880-98 and 3.) Ominous Portents 1898-1914. In this book, Vandervort makes the case that Africans did resist and European conquest was not a cake walk. In fact, the Italians were turned back at Adowa. Other Europeans were defeated in battles. There was resistance to the European Scramble for Africa.As I already mentioned, this is a scholarly work. However, for those interested in Africa, this is interesting history. One will understand why Africa was colonized by the Europeans. This is an interesting history book."
5,"Clear, comprehensive, effective","This book has been written for parents and those who are responsible for the health of children suffering with asthma. By outlining a proven 7-step program in detail, Dr. Firshein, who is a well-known authority in the field of Preventive Medicine, gives the reader a great program for systematically healing a child with asthma and giving him or her life tools and knowledge to recognize and deal with any future recurrences. It is a highly effective program that the author encourages parents to share with their child's health provider so that the child may have the best care possible. I personally know of children that have been on this program and it has given them and their parents a whole new lease on life, bringing hope and new found health for the whole family."
5,Love the series!,"Love this series! From what I can tell this particular product is a compilation of series 13, 14, 15 and 16. The price might look a touch high but the product is definitely worth watching! Wait for a sale then snap it up fast!"
5,Love the Series,The British know how to write and produce GREAT murder mysteries - buy all of them! Currently watching them again - just as good as the 1st time!
5,Midsomer passion,The best series for mysteries and great visuals of English life. I love the English dry wit and the beautiful landscapes.
5,Panasonic Shelf System AK640K,"An excellent value. Great sound at a reasonable price. Better specs than the model it replaced (AK630K) for the same price. A breeze to hook up. If you don't need or don't want a surround sound system but wnat to boost your movie watching enjoyment, this is the product for you. The separate sub-woofer makes a huge difference. DVD and broadcast movies never sounded better, not to mention my CDs. The five disk CD changer feature is an added bonus. I've found no negatives with this item. I love it."
3,"Looks good, may not feel great.","My wife wound up not loving the fabric on her skin - she insists on wearing a white t-shirt under it (it may not be the typical fabric as used on men's jerseys, or at least a different production of it).She does look good in it though!!!"
5,Her Space holiday is rocking band,"I WENT CRAZY THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THIS ALBUM, IT'S SO INSANE, I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT!!!!.....ORDER IT TODAY!!!!"
5,Love it,"I got this as a free sample when I bought some mascara.Tried it, and loved it. I wear quite a bit of eye makeup, and when I would use other makeup remover products, there was always ""leftovers""... little black specks or streaks, maybe some glitter. When I used the Bifacil though, every last bit of makeup was taken off with just a tiny bit of product and a cottonball. My eyes are super sensitive but the Bifacil didn't make my eyes sting either. Overall, it's an amazing product.Bifacil is a little bit pricey, but totally worth it. The free sample bottle was only 1.7oz or something. It was pretty small, but since you only need a tiny bit to remove your makeup, it lasted a REALLY long time."
4,"Amazing product, not so sure about the price...","I used this whole bottle so quickly because it's amazing and makes me want to wear makeup more often! Before, I had an eye make-up remover that was for removing light makeup, and so it often smudged my makeup or didn't take it off cleanly so I wouldn't wear make-up because it was just such a pain to remove.But I got this Lancome makeup remover, and it worked like a charm. It will take off /anything/, as far as I'm concerned. It doesn't burn or sting your eyes, and it just leaves you feeling refreshed. However, it is quite pricey so I am docking one star off for that (otherwise 5 stars all the way), and there is another brand which makes a similar eye makeup remover for a few bucks cheaper and it does the same thing. :x But if you can afford it, I definitely recommend it since Lancome almost always makes quality products :)"
4,Good but a bit over-priced,"I like this for removing my heavy waterproof eye makeup. It removes quite a bit of waterproof facial makeup, too. Obviously, cleansing afterwards is still needed. Shake it up and you get a nice mixture of oil and another liquid that takes off eye makeup with relative ease. Oil is important, in my opinion, to keep the eye area moist and really get all of the makeup off. I don't notice too much stinging or bluriness in my eyes after using this. My eyes still feel a little ""cloudy"" afterwards, probably because of the oil. I have to say that I like Clinique's Eye Makeup Remover better- it doesn't sting the eyes at all, works a little quicker and is a bit cheaper. But Lancome's smells very nice and is far better than old-fashioned baby oil or alcohol-based removers that dry out the delicate eye area."
5,The very best.,"I have tried- and keep trying- all the eye make-up removers I can find, and always come back to this one, when I can afford it. It is SO worth the price, perfect in every way, I hope it never gets discontinued..."
1,The Lancome BI-FACIL Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover arrived in terrible condition!,"I was very excited to try out this makeup remover, but I was extremely displeased. When the Lancome BI-FACIL Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover arrived at my house, there were two huge dents at the bottom of the bottle, and multiple scratches all over it. The bottle also looks like it has been opened.I am going to returne this product, and I have decided not to buy any more makeup products online, because I have always had to return them."
4,Lancome Bi facial,Lancome BI-FACIL Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover (125ml) 4.2 Fluid...The order arrived on time and with no problem. Thanks Ruth
2,"Still can't put it in, gasket not included","I thought I'd save a trip to the dealer and buy this online, but lo: it doesn't include the gasket I need. That's on a 2001 Dodge Ram 5.9 V8."
3,needs revision,"Boynton's work is a unique idea and is somewhat of an education in itself: interviews with some of the best non-fiction writers around about craft and procedure. However, the problem lays not so much in the interviews with the authors but the way Boynton packages the information in his book. Almost all of the writers are asked the same questions and after several hundred pages, this wears thin. In all the book totals 430 pages. If he narrowed down the list of writers and added some diversity in his questions and presentation of their interviews, it would be a more enjoyable and even beneficial read."
4,Immersion Journalists,"The New New Journalism is a fascinating peek into the techniques, thoughts and attitudes of immersion journalists, who spend months or even years with their subjects. I loved it!"
3,I had to buy this for a class,This book is a collection of interviews conducted on innovative writers. It's vaguely interesting if journalism is your thing. I think it could definitely benefit from having some excerpts from the authors work. This would at least provide a frame of reference for the interview.
5,The truth about J. Edgar Hoover,"R. Andrew Kiel's book is a fascinating look into the many facets of J. Edgar Hoover. This book begins with a well documented look into Hoover's early involvement in the fight against communism. Next Kiel takes an extraordinary look into the secrets, lies and untruths behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy and Hoover's possible involvement. The last section deals with Hoover's involvement in the escalation of troops in Vietnam during the Johnson administration. In the end, Kiel leaves you wondering how we could have been so naive to trust our government so blindly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a fascination with history and a desire for the truth."

5,Opera that keeps you awake,"I purchased this for my husband as a gift, but it is one we both enjoy. It is a very soothing & melodic piece that has kept us entertained for hours. A very rare & unique opera that we are glad we own."
1,Poor record quality spoils this completely,"Dreadful recording quality completely spoilt this for me, don't bother wasting your money, unless you are a real Callas fan."
1,Som ruim,"A qualidade do som desta gravao no está bom. Se voc quer escutar ""Bel canto"" noreal sentido da palavra compre uma das gravaes de Dame Joan Sutherland."
3,not that hot,This game is OK if you just want to drive around but when it comes to delivering goods its prety bad. You know what city to go to but you don't know where in the city your supposed to drop it off. Another thing I don't like is when you lose your trailor it is really hard to get it back becauase it looks like it is in the ground.
3,Pretty Good,"When i first bought this game i thought it would be great, I was wrong. When you pick the West map, Midwest map , and Mountains map it takes a long time to load. Soon after that when you start playing the game it has a lot of glitches. Another problem is when you want to deliver something it only tells you the city its in, not how to get there or were to go. The last problem is it sometimes exits out of the game while you are playing it and it doesn't save so you have to start over again. If you want to buy this game, dont enless you have a brand new computer with lots of space for more games."
5,Never Let her go,"This is an outstanding movie. Both stars have gone on to greater things, but they are clearly masters of the material here."
5,Mark Harmon is brilliant as Tom Capano!!,"ann rule's and never let her go is a brilliant true crime masterpiece. this is the chilling story of tom capano....a rich, brilliant in law, charming and evil in his manpulation.mark harmon gives a tour de force performance this is better than deliberate stranger. i love this performance of a man so evil. let me tell you how evil this guy is....he is very controlling. he lies to everyone women he see. he will lie to get to the one girl that didnt want him. he makes his lover buy the murder weapon so that he wouldnt be caught in a gun shop. he uses his brothers construction business to dump the body and has a freaky side to his madness if you know what i mean. these are just some of the evil that tom capano has done. watching mark harmon is amazing and this is a must have for your dvd collectionthis is not your typical lifetime movie. this is a masterpiece. mark deserves an emmy for this performance."
5,Is he really guilty?,"Mark Harmon does a masterful job of portraying Tom Capano, a politically powerful Wilmington attorney involved in simultaneous love affairs. I was so impressed and intrigued by the movie, I had to read the book. And I'm still not sure Tom Capano did it. Capano is depicted by Ann Rule as an obsessive planner with daily sheets of how he will spend his day broken down into 15 minute increments. How could he spontaneously murder someone? And if he had planned the murder, why would he murder her in his own home? And how could the dress she was wearing at dinner be found in her own apartment, neatly laid out on her bed without a bloodstain on it? And what about the fruit in her kitchen left to spoil? I'm sure Capano got rid of the body, but did he kill her?"
2,A parents book,"Through the looking glass is in no way a journey of any kind. It will not deeply emurse you in the world of anorexia, nor will it provoke any emotional response.This book largely cronicles a mother grappling to understand her daughters eating disorder and OCD behaviours. It contains excerpts of letters exchanges between the mother and daughter during this time, as well as a diary-esque look at her stint in a hospital programme.It is not as engrossing as ""Wasted"" by Mayra Hornbacher, but it provides hope and is a testiment to the strength of the relationships in this family. Suitable for parents or siblings wishing to gain an understanding of eating disorders. It also adresses the pressing issue of governmental funding and the lack of treatment facilities in the UK.Through the looking glass, is a somewhat reflected experiance."
5,great,"it came very soon, in 3 days and it functions well and compared to its competitors its a good bargain!"
1,"Non-stick, my foot!","Please be aware that these pans are definitely not 'non-stick.' You HAVE to use paper cups. If you do not use paper, it is not OK to use oil - they will leave a big cooked-on mess if you do - requiring mucho cleaning! If you ask Kaiser about it they say you must use butter - NOT oil. (Interesting). Actually I did use butter in a couple of cases and got nasty sticking as well.The Jamie Oliver carbon steel non-stick muffin pan DOES work!"
1,Stainless grill,"Don't be fooled.. It says grille, but it is really just a grill insert. You will not receive the complete grill."
2,A major disappointment,"Vonnegut and Adams are two of my favorite authors, and -- perhaps more importantly -- I loved Bo Fowler's other book, Scepticism, Inc. Very sadly, though, I found The Astrological Diary of God to be tough to even finish. It's too focused on masturbation, the characters are otherwise not very compelling, and the story seems to lose itself halfway through the book. That said, I highly encourage readers who like Vonnegut and similar authors to check out Scepticism, Inc. and, personally, intend to read whatever Bo Fowler publishes next."
2,tries too hard to be vonnegut,I was unable to finish this book. Half way through I thought if I want vonnegut I can read breakfast of champions again. So I did.
4,Leaping and circling,Once again the circle of life is completed by the salmon of the pacific northwest. This is a cumulative story about the journey of the salmon from natal stream to ocean and back again. Parents nourish children who leave home to return to nourish their children.Pictures a deeply colored and beautifully detailed. Would probably work best with slightly older children rather than younger. Would make an excellent classroom discussion book.
4,i like it,This book contains some beautiful artwork. Lots for the little ones to look at while you read.
3,Go Team Go is not a very good book,Go team Go is a book basically on basketball. There arent many problems throughout the book though. It is mainly about basketball and I recommend it to the people out there who enjoy books on sports. It is the best sports book ive read because I havent really read any fiction books on sports.
3,too much lint,"Considering the brand name, these were disappointing in that they gave off way too much lint, even after several washes and dries. Considering the price, I should have guessed they were not prime quality. Size was not standard--the last four I bought in the same color were several inches longer. Color is gorgeous, and lint has died down with time."
4,"nice towel, sheds a lot",These towels are fine but I had red fuzz in the bathroom for about 3 weeks after I started using them. That's starting get better. I really needed towels anyway.
3,Nice Size Decent Quality,I got these towels in pink. I wanted to have some towels that were just for mom and these pink towels stood out and they were on sale so I thought I would order 3. I liked the size of the towel. The texture was not as soft as I would have liked. It is certanly softer then a towel bought a walmart but I have some Laura Ashley and Ralph Lauren towels I paid a similiar price for that are much softer.I have had these towels for about 6 months now. They have held up well through many washings but seem a bit rougher over time.
3,too much lint,"Too much lint until after the first several washings, good size, outstanding color, disappointing initial quality for the brand name."
3,bad deal amazon,"got bath towel for 7 bucks with a free hand towel, but amazon wouldn't let me buy more than one of each color, so now i have mismatched towels for my bath which bothers me. other than that, thick and soft, large towel, but it seems like it is almost too soft too be very absorbent. even if i only use very little fabric softener."
3,too much lint,"Too much lint after several washes, good size, fine after a while, should have been better given the brand name."
2,It's not good for the money,It's not worth for the money i paid . Will get the same thing for 4 bucks in Bed Bath & Beyond . Don't buy it here .
2,Th Luxe Towel,"I found this towel to be quite nice. I found that it washes best in cold water, to avoid overlinting. It was soft and absorbant. I really like the oversize Bath Towel, it is generous but not too big. I will purchase it again."
2,Stay Away from these Towels.,"I bought these before other parts of the set were offered. I was under the impression from the way they were advertised that you got a bath towel, hand towel, and wash cloth. I paid 19.99 for the bath towel alone and bought two. I was disappointed when I got them, but I was travelling so I had to move on and didn't go through the hassle of sending them back.I washed the towels before I used them to make sure that they were colorfast and they are not. I don't know how many washings it will take before they stop bleeding. They are large and soft, but they ""shed"" over everything. Literally. Anything that you wash will have red ""balls"" all over them (other towels, underwear) and when I shower, my tub is filled with red ""balls"" and red residue in the tub. There are red ""balls"" on the floor - just everywhere.I don't know if this is particular to all the towels, but just be aware."
1,Wrong Color,I order blade green I was send A white one and the two other towels I order were the right color but not the size I was told they would be. A lot smaller then the white one.I called amazon they gave me 15% off my bill I would of rather had what I order not happy
2,Sheds small fibers,"The towel is quite soft, however after using it, your body will be covered with small fibers all over. - not recommended."
1,"Another rip-off, please save your money","I've read the book.One look at the ""testimonial"" pictures in the back and you'll know this is worse than a rip-off.Because she is intructing you to go thru a laborious, time-consuming process. And even her own customer's before and after pics are a joke."
1,Bad One,Why did Claudia have to be a DJ. And Ashley must not be in the book because remember what happened in #12? he played with Claudia!
3,Not quite replacements...,I was a bit disappointed with these 'replacements' - they really aren't (though the accompanying graphic shows stylii that look like the original). These are just black plastic versions that are shaped the same.Pros: They fit in the stylus holder ok and they're reasonably cheap. You get three and you'll probably lose some so that's nice. Just be sure to put the spares somewhere that you'll remember.Cons: These are one piece shaped alike versions. They have no removable end with a reset wire like the original. They're sort of crusty to use - just don't feel good in your hand and aren't finished very well.Overall: They work. It might be hard to find an original replacement now and even if you do they'll be expensive (relatively) and you'll probably lose another one if you lost the first. I'd say they're ok if you can't afford or can't find an original replacement.
2,Still Looking,"Read the ""fine print"". I thought I was getting the original Handspring stylus(based on the picture) when in fact it is a black plastic wannabe. Where are the multi colored 5 paks? These work but are much lighter and easy to misplace because they are all black."
2,"Fits well, but isn't the same as the original","I bought this thinking that it was the same as the original stylus I'd lost. Forget it. It fits well in the slot, works well to write Graffiti, but it does not have the reset pin hidden under the stylus head/cap. If not having a built-in reset pin is not a big deal for you, then this is a good buy."

2,Not identical replacements,"I just received my replacement styli, and they are not the same as the original. They are very light weight and all plastic. I was hoping they were the heavier kind with the hard tip. Kinda disappointed. :("
1,Please Don't Buy Sunbeam!!!,"I bought the ""top of the line"" Sunbeam product at a retail store three years ago. It has a five year warranty. I first returned it to the retail store WITHIN ONE MONTH OF HAVING IT. I have returned the 1st replacement to the manufacturer 3 times! Each winter, at the beginning of the season, it goes out! It stops getting warm altogether, the controls start malfunctioning, or one side heats and the other doesn't. It takes 4-8 weeks to get the product back. I had Sunbeam to replace my blanket last year and guess what? The new one is malfunctioning! I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SUNBEAM PRODUCT EVER! I am online looking for a reliable brand. Avoid this one like the plague!"
2,Old Info Here,"For the price, this book is not worth it. I spent some time reading through this at the YALE book store. The information and its slant seem better suited for the Dark Ages!"
4,"Concepts presented well, but slightly dated examples.",The principles are sound. The book is easy to read. The case studies in the appendix are very helpful
1,A very dated book.,The concepts and methodologies in this book were 'modern' ten years ago. They are now mostly obsolete!Avoid this book at all costs!
1,This book is extrmemly dated.,"This book seems to take the 'my way or the highway' approach. There is more than one good way to approach structured design, this is just one approach.The content is very dated, it may have applied well in a 1985 glass-house, Cobol environment. But has very littly relevance today."
4,Practical and Comprehensive,"Music In Childhood was the textbook for two classes I took during my undergrad - Methods for Early Childhood Music and Methods for Middle Childhood Music. Both were really important segments of my music ed. degree. Even though I will never be more than a private piano instructor, I found this textbook to be packed with vital help about children and their ability to learn music - bottom line. I don't ever plan on teaching school and I am quite happy with my piano studio, but there are some things that are universal in teaching music and this text seems to highlight each and every one of them. I didn't hang on to any of my conducting books or vocal methods books, but this one I kept. I have used it many times as a reference and I know I'll use it in the future. This is almost essential to any music teacher out there, whether you're in the schools or simply have a private studio like I do."
4,Excellent Text book,"An Easy to read and follow instructions for prospects in Music, Elementary Music Teachers, College students and more. Very easy music notes to follow"
3,OK but awful narrator,"The narrators are AWFUL: they are cheesy, anticlimatic and annoying. They present the documentary as a ""letter to the rhinos"", which would be fine if it were brief and introductory, but it goes on and on. They also don't do a good enough job of getting the facts across, and when I watch a documentary I'm interested in the facts.However, the facts that are presented are really interesting: I won't give anything away, but the reason why the rhinos are leaving the relocation area is fascinating."
4,Cheesy pop music? At least the dances are fun!,"After spending a year in Britain, most Brits are dismayed that I returned to the States with a previously undiscovered love of Steps, all I can say in response is that the British really do know how to package their cheesy dance music. Tragedy is a great tune, and I'm forever indebted to my flatmates for introducing me to it! And how can you not like a group who includes instructions on how to dance to their songs, as well as supplying two otherwise useless males to shake their bums around? God I miss Britain! When's this coming out in America?"
1,The Shame of England,"Just when I'd done travelling around Europe apologising for The Spice Girls, along comes a group that makes that particular fabulous fivesome (as it was at the time) sound like Mozart. Steps are the most mindless, moronic, banal, soulless, talentless bunch of nobodies to have appeared on the British music scene since the bad ol' days of Rick Astley et al. Now I've got to go book another round the world ticket so I can travel the globe once more as an ambassador for taste, offering my nation's apologies for releasing this c**p upon them. How can a country capable of producing Radiohead and Fat Boy Slim and Stereophonics etc, etc, be responsible for this?"
3,one for sorrow,"I love steps and I love the song tragedy, one for sorrow, and all your song. But I can't sing it, can you send for me your song teks?thank's. Mariani"
5,Steps Rule!!!!!!!!!!!,"Who doesn't like steps? Not me and not any of my friends. Even my mum dances around and tries to sing to Tragedy, and what a tragedy that is!!! Steps definitely Rule."
2,Steps are soooooo coooool ;P,"TWO THUMBS UP <g> for this ""cool"" album....the tragedy is not when the feeling is gone but when steps are here...more mindless teenybopper trash but wait you even get dance steps to impress your mates at school... don't waste your time."
4,Readable Rat History,"I was compelled to read this book about rats from the back page blurb and the fact that it had been on the best seller list (that means other people must have liked it enough to recommend it again and again). I was not let down. The writing was comfortable and never made me double back to ""connect the dots"". I enjoyed the behavioral observations (rats and people) and the interspersed history of New York city. It all fit together well with gentle humor that, tho I never laughed outloud, led me to smile and then dive straight back into the book. I wouldn't have thought a book about NY rats would be so facinating and enjoyable. The only thing I couldn't figure out, how the author came up with the idea of writing about this subject in the first place. I'm glad he did. It's a fast and original read."
3,Eeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwww!,"This was a hard book to pin down. It meanders around between being part instructional manual, part journal as well as being interspersed with quirky, obscure history lessons that are only tangentially related to rats. No doubt, the stories are entertaining and Mr. Sullivan is a very good writer. However, the book does seem to have a case of Attention Deficit Disorder. The author makes no bones about the fact that he's was and still is very squeamish about being around rats. He'll get no argument from me on that point. God knows how many times I squirmed and shivered while reading the darn thing. Mr. Sullivan's book will give you some interesting information about rats, societal attitudes, obscure American plagues caused by them and the pest control warriors who battle the ubiquitous, little urban dwellers. But I finished the book still having quite a few questions left unanswered. An interesting read, but incomplete."
1,There is a rat here alright!,"I am amazed at the good press that Rats received. Public Radio interviews, reviews in the major mags. Seemed like a must read. What a bust. There is very little about Rats in this book---not more than a few pages. If you are interested in obscure New York History (which is not even slightly connected to rats) then this is the book for you. The book continues to get great reviews, even in this forum. I must have missed something."
3,"Good, but not really about rats","I enjoyed this book quite a bit, although it was not really what I was looking for. It really is not as much about rats as it is about the history of New York city and the plague. There are a couple of times when the author gets very much off topic and tries weekly to pull a rat story into it and it doesn't work. Particularly at the end. The only thing about rats that I learned was that they are everywhere and they eat garbage. Which I, of course, already knew. It is an enjoyable book though."
1,A disappointment,"As a rat fan and history major I was excited to read this book. I am very glad it was a library book and not one I'd purchased for it was a huge disappointment. There isn't a whole lot about rats in the darn book! I tried really hard to like it, but the composition of the book was poor and it is not very well crafted so I have to give it a single star. If he'd had the guts to get up closer to the rats it would have made for a more compelling story."
4,I love rats,This book is wonderfully written and recommended to anyone thatis considering incorporating a rat or two in to their family.The history of rats is fascinating. Knowing more about the rat family will make you a better pet person.
5,Great read!,this is an awesome book! It is totally intriguing and informative. I enjoyed every word!
4,"Not what I expected, but fun.","This book is about rats in the same way that ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" was about zen and motorcycles. This book is a personal journey of the author as he discovers rats, rat lore, and people in and about ""his city"". I don't think I learned anything from this book, but at the same time I enjoyed it thoroughly and might re-read it again someday. Good light reading - it would be PERFECT for airplane travel or a relaxing weekend (assuming you aren't squicked by descriptions of LOTS of rats)."
3,A narrative of rat-watching,"The book was mostly engaging -- I got through it enthusiastically in a couple of days of sitting on trains -- but a little thin on the ground. Would have preferred more citation and more fact and less personal narrative. As someone else put it, this is less about rats and more about rat-watching, but rat-watching turns out to be not uninteresting and you do learn a little bit about rats along the way and a fair bit about New York City. For the used books, the price is right!"
3,Certainly Worth the Read!,"The book starts off with an excellent foray into the fundamentals of the unseen world of rats in New York City. Its a great lesson on the history of one of the World's foremost cultural hegemons, while also exposing a lot of ""bet cha diddnt know that"" style facts and facets of this aspect of the animal world. The author's fervor tapers off a bit after a few chapters, and the writing style becomes a bit less engrossing, less engaging than the opening. However, all of the information is quite fascinating to anyone interested in zoology, symbiosis between humans and animals, and a history of the grittiest aspects of NYC. Anyone living in this city has much to gain from this read. In short, its a fascinating, easy to read, and worthwhile source for information that I doubt Id read a second time."
2,Disappointing,"I have rarely found a more poorly-written book on such an interesting subject. Darn shame, as I (like other reviewers below) really wanted to like this book due to its subject.The author does not move himself to the background. This book is not about rats so much as the author's adventures as he learns about rats. Rats are interesting, Robert Sullivan is less so.The book is full of distracting misspellings ('They' for 'The' for example) and nonstandard capitalization ('Edens alley' for 'Edens' Alley' throughout). Each page has a half dozen places that brings the reader out of the story and back into the real world.Further, the author is unable to write in a linear fashion. His description of of the alley is a jumble. I read the entire book and still cannot make a mental map of the place.All in all, the subject deserves a better treatment than it receives here. An interesting, readable book on the urban rat remains to be written."
5,Gary Gilmore story...,"A prospective of a murderer told eloquently by his brother...Gary Gilmore was unusual in requesting that he be executed immediately for his crimes. He was guilty so he knew he should pay. He insisted that his attornies drop all appeals. Knowing that gives this book more insight into the man that was Gary Gilmore. His brother's tells the story from both sides, the public who wanted his blood and the brother that loved him."
5,Feel the Pain,"We have always been told by society to never pitty and feel compassion for those who would make vitims of the innocent. But, after reading A Shot in the Heart, I felt nothing but sorrow for a young man, his family, as well as his victims some twenty years after his execution. Mikal Gilmour paints a vividly terrifying picture of truly damaged American family on an unstopable collision course with tragedy. Despite the descriptions of abuse the Gilmour family suffered from an insecure, alcoholic father, I could not stop reading this powerful account of the first and last days of an American paraiah who would ultimately meet his fate in front of a Utah Firing Squad, three decades ago. A definite must read."
4,Shot in the Heart,"I recently read this nonfiction story about the Gilmore family. It was very depressing and sad about how a father and mother basically ruined their entire family. The children were emotionally scarred, and physically and or mentally abused. the story was told by the youngest brother who seemed to be trying himself, to figure out what had gone on in their family. His brothers were considerably older than him and bore the brunt of the physical abuse which turned on into a killer and another into a sociopath and a third into a withdrawn sad person. What a waste of a family. It is too bad no guidance counselor or anyone else could see what was happening to these boys when they were growing up to prevent the tragedy. The book was well written but extremely sad. An interesting character analysis of all the members of the family, it really was too bad these were living people who endured all of that emotional and physical pain."
4,Authenticity.,"Perhaps everyone has one good book in them, but it is rare to have witnessed and researched what Mr. Gilmore has here. Another review used the word artifact and that touches on the authenticity of the book. To simplify, the reader can infer that the intelligent and artistic Gary Gilmore came to expect repression as the expression of fatherly behavior and ultimately appealed to have himself shot in the heart. In contrast, the equally willful crimes of Mr. Bundy, who may have killed hundreds, never resulted in a desire on his part to submit to his punishment. Society may be thankful for the honorableness of Gary's decision. There is much to think about in this book. Much as the current Monica story, reading the tea leaves here will reveal more about the reader than the tea."
5,"A gorgeous, haunting book","I have given and recommended this book to countless friends, and return to read it when my soul needs nourishment. Gilmore's book is one of those rare artifacts that live and breathe on its own. This is less a book than a living piece of music, one whose beauty is not bright and cheery yet whose light shines fiercely and passionately. Shot in the Heart astonishes me not only for the story it has to tell, but the craft with which the author has captured, and transcended his tale. He has transformed his family history into a gift for every reader."
5,Unforgettable,My literary tastes run towards light-hearted fare like the novels of Jane Austen. I bought this book after reading an exerp from it in Rolling Stone which really moved me. My mother read the it and deemed it too depressing. It's not a book that you can read over and over but it leaves an impression on you long after you have finished it. The last book that had that kind of effect on me was 'Grapes of Wrath.' 'Shot in the Heart' is a powerful book written with grace and sadness. It's incomparable.
4,"Deeply Personal, But Questions Remain","A fascinating companion piece to ""The Executioner's Song"", Shot in the Heart tells the story Gary Gilmore refused steadfastly to discuss with Norman Mailer and Larry Schiller. The authority is no less than Gilmore's own semi-famous brother. The abuse that Gilmore's questioners were sure was there is indeed laid out in heartbreaking detail. In the end, though, questions remain - what was real in Bessie's remembrance of ghosts and demons? What was the terrifying secret that Frank Gilmore kept from his family? The fact that these questions remain unanswered, however, only serves to reinforce that life is usually a lot more messy than fiction. A troubling book with darkness at its core - read it, but learn from it."
4,"Small town, big life","This non-fiction book features a loose narrative about restoring Perry's old truck, but the real story is his slice-of-life tale covering 12+ months of his life in a small Wisconsin town. Maybe it's because I'm from a similar small town in the UP of Michigan, but by the end of the book, I wanted to jump in my own truck and drive down there to meet the people he mentions and hear him sing and play his guitar. Definitely worthy of shelf space (I even bought one as a gift for a friend because I didn't want to loan mine out), this book inspired me to write my own, which will appear on amazon.com soon. Watch for it: Bookworms Anonymous."
5,Love on many different levels is the theme unifying all,"While TRUCK: A LOVE STORY is a follow-up to the author's best-seller POPULATION: 485, no prior familiarity with that memoir or Perry is required to fall in love with TRUCK. Here are three main themes: restoring a 1950s International Harvest truck, cultivating a garden, and discovering romance late in life - all of which blend beautifully in a story of colorful small-town characters and enchantment. Love on many different levels is the theme unifying all, creating a delicate, involving story which will appeal to general-interest audiences - even those with no prior connections to trucks or small towns!Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Has possibilities....in parts,"Living in a fly over state (Oklahoma), I can appreciate some of the humor, most definitely the characters and overall the simplicity of life that often we enjoy. The rebuilding of the truck, the gardening (my tomato crop was lousy last year also) and the struggling relationship kept my interest and caused a few outbursts of laughter. But as the book progressed, it seemed Mr. Perry bogged down in his home grown philosophy. In fact, there were times I said, ""Huh?"" His descrption of characters, gardening and life off the fast lane were enjoyable. His philosphical tomes were not. Suggestion: Read the good parts...skip the others."
5,Wonderful!,"Another great one from Mike Perry! I'm a stoic, and I had tears in my eyes at times. Hilarious, moving, and honest - I'd read the phone book if it were written by Mike Perry."
2,Somewhat interesting,"Interesting look at life in rural Wisconsin..The author seems to have got hold of a thesaurus in order to select words for this book that might suggest he is an accomplished writer, but fails in my view as his poor choice of esoteric words make the text difficult to follow at times, leaving me to wonder the true meaning behind his words.He is best when using words he is familiar with. The story is a stretch when one considers the topic of the book is a '51 truck..There are far better choices out there than this book."
4,Truck. Great read especially for car collectors and restorers.,I would give Perry five stars if he had spent more time on the truck and less on his sweetheart. It is called a love story but he is in love with both the truck and his girlfriend. The truck deserves more time.
4,Great book,"Wonderful prose, insights regarding relationships, also lovely picture of life in rural America, as well as how to appreciate urban life. Thoroughly delightful and thought provoking read."
4,wonderful read,"I grew up in wisconsin, and now live in Oregon for over 25 years, but this is soooo upper midwest. I found some parts slow, but other parts just so midwestern humor. A delightful, slow, read. I really hate New York lit, everyone is rich and confused and unhappy, this is midwest lit, amusing, everyone is poor and real."
4,Midwest,If people from the coasts want to understand the thinking in the flyover states read this book. It is both touching and has humor.
2,Good for some I'm sure - but I hated it.,"I gave it two stars instead of one because I have to admit that I could not bring myself to finish this book - I stopped short of halfway. I can also see how some people would like this book, but I simply can't relate to the main character, and frankly if I met him in real life I think I would be annoyed by him.Perhaps it's because it's about a complaining middle-aged single man. While I generally appreciate self-deprecation, I found him wimpy. He's clueless under a hood. He's agnostic and borderline offensive toward Christians. He daydreams about traditional gender roles while apologizing profusely out of political correctness. His most likable feature: he's a former volunteer firefighter/EMT.Don't get this book for a real gearhead or for someone who will not appreciate philosophical ramblings."
2,Truck is Mired in the Muck on a Slow Trip through NoWhere,"This reviewer was born and raised, and still alive and quite well, thank you, in the Midwest - so the following is not a biased Coastal PutDown of ""the FlyOver:"" and maybe that's my problem with this book - maybe Perry can dazzle them that ain't here with a bucolic (and false) (and misogynistic) (and meandering) (and portrayal of locals-as-Green-Acres-TV-caricatures) sense of a peaceful, pastoral life out here in the hinterlands. But I ain't buyin' it (Thank Goodness I borrowed this from the Library) and I ain't a wastin' no more time a readin' it.(Life is too short. Too many books, too little time.)If you and your Book Club like artsy a la Haruf stuff, this book's for you.If not, don't get yourself stuck in Perry's Truck./TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
4,Merck Manual,Now I finally have a book which I can use to refer some situations I haven't come across. Great Book~~
4,Good home reference,"Very informative book. Easy to read & understand. However, after purchasing this book, I found that all of the text (that I have searched for so far) is available online also- FOR FREE! If I had known this, I wouldn't have purchased it for sure. But still a good reference nonetheless.If you're sick in bed or stuck on the toilet often, etc, then just get the book for reading (staring at computer screens all day messes you up anyway).Price was great."
2,Poorly written and politically correct.,"Having a background in medicine, I am very disappointed. This book can be confusing and does not accurately or properly deal with serious health issues of the day. While subtle, it gives a free pass to destructive activities in the name of not offending while ignoring studies that show clearly show fatalities resulting from destructive life styles and beliefs. In my opinion, it gives the field of medicine a black eye and can't help but prompt the educated reader to question the validity of the writers. It is poorly written. Not the type of book I would recommend to my students or residents."
5,Wow! The most complete and easy to understand collection,"This review is for the paperback 2nd Home Edition pusblished May 2004.If you, family members, or friends have some kind of physicial discomfort or illness, chances are this book has an explantion and a solution for it! Written for people that have no particular medical understanding whatsoever. The explanations are extremely detailed, and some section have illustrations and diagrams for performing emergency procedures. Over 1,767 pages of valuable information for an incredible price of $7.99, wow! If Gray's Anatomy is considered as de facto for people in biology/medical fields, then this book is the bible for how to correctly apply those knowledges to save life."
4,Good Home-Reference for Most,"I'm an RN student and ordered this book along with the ""real"" Merck Manual. While I would highly recommend this for people without much clinical background, I would strongly recommend that an RN student save their money. I've opened this book once since I bought it and I'll be giving it away to a family member. Not that the information contained in it isn't great, but I can get much more information out of my Merck Manual so I don't even waste time picking this book up. If you're a student or professional in a clinical setting looking for a book to quickly reference pathophys in, then skip this book altogether and just get the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. However, if this book is intended for someone not in the medical profession, then by all means, this is the book to have."
5,Merck Manual Home Edition is an inexpensive paperback that should be in every household,"I previously had the First Home Edition of the Merck Manual and the Second Edition is even larger. I've never seen any medical-information paperback designed for use by the general public that has the details and information found in the Merck Manual Home Edition. I did see a book in the library from Johns Hopkins that seemed to be comparable information-wise, however, my recollection is that it's not a paperback."
4,Doctor,"This item was purchased for my aunt to replace her smaller very worn out manual. She thought this was an updated version; however, it was the same edition in a larger form & print. While it is a bit large for her to handle, she usually weighs below 100 ans is bed ridden, since she is equipped with her Merck, she is the doctor. She is in a nursing home, and actually challenges them on information contained in her Merck Manual. So not only did she receive a great buy from Amazon, she also received to Medical Degree."
3,Merck Manual,Condition and delivery time excellent. Print so small can't be read without a high powered magnifier.
2,Crocheting in Plain English,"I am Carl Hehmsoth's wife. When I began reading this book, I noticed that 2 pages (11-12 and 13-14) were missing. I am returning it today. I went to Heroic Image website and noticed that Crocheting in Plain English was not available. Will you or Heroic Image try to find me another book or am I to expect a refund?"
4,Good for beginners,"This book is very good for someone with little or beginner knowledge of crochet. Easy to understand, and good pictures."
1,disappointed,"If I had been able to see the inside of this book I never would have bought it. It is not what I expected. I have seen this type of crocheting symbols before and find it difficult to get used to since I have crocheted for years using the standard abbreviations. This book will be donated to my public library, I have no use for it."
4,It taught me to crochet.,"I learned to knit in Ms. Righetti's ""Knitting in Plain English"". With that knowledge, even when some of her directions were hard to understand, I let common sense take over. I am dissappointed in her lessons at the end of the book. I felt they were very ""dated"" and ""grandma-ish"". Crocheting is so trendy and hip right now, I would have enjoyed patterns that were more modern. (Yes, I know this book was written in '88.) So, all in all this is a good reference book for crocheting. But I wouldn't recommend it for the patterns in the lesson chapters."
2,"Good, but not quite there!","When I bought this book, I thought it would have good diagrams, good patterns and good advice. It did not have any of the above. Miss Righetti sounds too matronly, always talking about ""mother nature"", ""foremothers"", ""She"", meaning God. I think this is all fine, but I got tired of all the redundancy. The diagrams where not clear, and old looking! All in all, I would not recommend this book! Trust me!"
3,Solid Mystery,"Ralph McInerny writes good mystery. Notre Dame fans in particular will enjoy this story set on the campus. It shows a delightful understanding of the way major Universities work and the life of the average graduate student. I was not completely comfortable with McInerny's portrayal of women, all of whom seemed willing to do just about anything to get their man. Overall, I enjoyed this mystery and found it very pleasant reading."
4,The Great Gatsby,"I enjoyed the book and wanted to see the movie. Big fan of R. Redford., the Great Gatsby.Does closely follow the book."
5,Delightful,"I bought both movies of The Great Gatsby and Robert Redford, Mia Farrow was the best of the two movies. I also appreciate being able to have subtitles because I did not want to miss one word. The other Great Gatsby said I would have to get it from my TV. I did not know how to do that but the other Gatsby was not as good and did not explain things that were occuring as welli intend to watch it again and again.....I found it delightful and thrilling"
4,"The ""Greatest"" Great Gatsby Movie","As with any movie that's based on a book, the book will always be superior. I've seen all the Gatsby movies, and this is by far the best one. I can't think of anyone better to play Jay Gatsby than ""The Natural"", Robert Redford. Mia Farrow played a good Daisy Buchanan, as Farrow's over-acting, exaggeratedly-dramatic hallmark fit well in her character. Sam Waterston played a great Nick, as the objective third party between Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan (Bruce Dern). I suggest that every read the book by F. Scott Fitzgerald of course before you watch the movie. The 1949 movie with Alan Ladd and Betty Field was okay, and the 2000 made-for-TV movie with Toby Stephens was decent, but this one was superb."
2,Largely Unfaithful to the Book,"Though many of the characters' lines are taken directly from the book, they are often incomplete or in the wrong order. This destroys some of the thematic statements made by F.S. Fitzgerald in the novel, on which the film is based. These themes, such as money, the American Dream, friendship, hypocracy, dishonesty, and carelessness are severely lacking in the film. In some cases, these subjects are present, but are shown in a different way than they were in the book. Many of these themes are almost totally absent, and wouldn't be detectable unless one read the book first, which is highly reccommended.Read the book, rent the movie, experience its shortcomings, then return it."
2,Not at all impressed by this adaptation,"I am a high school student and just finished reading and discussing F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'. The book is wonderful. This movie is not. First, the movie does NOT stick to the book well, at times, extra scenes were added which did not add to the overall plot at all. In fact, it just made the movie seem frightfully dull. The actors, as well, were not well picked. I especially was displeased with Mia Farrow as Daisy. Robert Redford did possess Gatsby's good looks, but lacked the charm and mystique that was so important to his character. Why the two stars instead of one? Howard da Silva's very short appearence as Meyer Wolfsheim. At least they got something right."
5,Very true to the book,Wonderful classic that is very close to the story. The characters are perfect for their roles. Entertaining and well done.
5,Enjoyed,I finally saw this 1974 movie by seeing it on my Kindle Fire. Enjoyed the movie a great deal. Glad I finally saw this classic.
1,what a dissapointment!,"One of the greatest pieces of American literature, but a soulless film.Mia Farrow is great for what she is doing for Darfur! But Iwish I hadn't seen this.Glad I read the book first."
4,Great after nearly 40 years,I watched this movie due to my recent visit to Newport where I visited the Great Gatsby mansion. The movie has not dated and with the excellent acting and directing well worth watching the two and a half hours.
2,Not so great.,"Great novels shouldn't be filmed. Period. They're not great because of their plots, but because of their style, and writing style is, needless to say, not the same as cinematic style, and can't be duplicated on film. You can't duplicate, for instance, Fitzgerald's description of Nick's first look at Daisy, so why try? It's taken me years to get Mia Farrow's awful Daisy out of my head, and I don't want to dwell on it too much here, but it's not entirely her fault. Daisy only lives and breathes on the page. Mira Sorvino tried hard in the recent A&E version, but it's still an inevitable misfire. (A&E's version is so faithful, though, that it seems like a film of the Cliff Notes instead.) I'll say this, though; the Redford version truncated the narration at the very end, and yet, for a movie, it seemed to end right where it should. If only the filmmakers hadn't shattered the mood with ""Ain't We Got Fun"" and prancing flappers behind the closing credits . . ."
4,Not the best adaptation but ..,"I found some of the performances shallow and not as in depth as the novel but, it's still a great film. I do not feel that anyone can take a novel like Gatsby and turn it into a 2 hour film with great success. If you have not read the novel then I think you may find it a bit lacking. You have to know the back stories that are not present in the film version.I wish that Acorn Media or the BBC would make the novel into a miniseries because I know they would do credit to the novel."
2,The Missing Score,"I could watch this film over and over, and was delighted to find it at Amazon.com. But I was bitterly disappointed to discover that the original score had been replaced. I would not have made this purchase had I known. With the original score, I'd rate The Great Gatsby 5 stars."
4,A Robert Redford fans must see movie.,"True to the book, this slow moving, yet provacative movie about the life of a 20's golden boy is a must see for Robert Redford fans. Costumes and party scenes are the best part. The video is a disappointment from the orginal movie since it omits ""What'll I Do"", which is played throughout the movie version. I was VERY disappointed when viewing the video without this song. It is truly the most romantic part of the film with the chemistry between the two leads."
1,Bad,"I'll admit I think the novel is over-rated, but Fitzgerald deserved better than this tired, awkward adaptation."
2,Please! just read the book,"I admit that the film captured some subtleties that I missed from reading the book and thats about all the movie does for the classic novel. The casting of the film was terrible. Redford did a par job of protraying Gatsby but Farrow turend Daisy to a bimbo airhead that likes pretty colors {watch the flying shirt scene} and Nick was BORING. All in all watch the movie first if you want to pass your English class with a D-,as for anyone out of school, Please!just read the book.{from a 16 year old high school student passing his English class with a D-}"
2,cant stream the video,"unable to watch movie, kept getting error messages so unable to stream the movie I have seen the movie before and it is a good so this is in no way a reflection on the movie, just the incompatibility of Amazon's service and our ISP to allow us to watch the movie."
4,This is a classic. everybody should see this again before watching the new version.,"I enjoyed it very much. I saw the movie long time ago, I had forgotten many details. The actors are very good. I suggest that you all watch it again and compare with the new one."
4,As good as.i remember!,I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the book! I had to watch the original movie before the new movie came out!
4,Quite a story line,"It was a little slow in parts and a little over acted, but in the end I was well entertained and enjoyed it very much. Feally appreciated the lack - I said LACK of over sexed and rotten language that is common in most new movies."
4,Very good not great,"All star cast.,. True to the novel... The ending was a little lack luster but def worth watching... Redford, dern and worthington deliver a stellar performance..."
1,Ugh,lighting = horriblemusic = horriblecasting = horrible144 minutes of my life wasted.I am praying the Luhrmann 2013 version will erase this one from my memory.
5,The Best,"I don't know what people are talking about. All I can think is they have not read the book, because everything about the movie reflects the story. A younger Robert Redford is perfect as the rich, but somewhat pathetically wanting Jay Gatsby and Mia Farrow make a perfectly lovely, but foolish and silly Daisy Buchanan. And, Nick Carraway as portrayed by Sam Waterson was just right as the narrator/friend of Gatsby. The sites of the books are portrayed by shifting location making you think they are exactly where they should be. The gorgeous mansion in Newport R.I. made a perfect ballroom and even the smallest of references to things seen throughout the story just right in the movie. Any variation work because they do not destroy the intent of the book."
4,"Daisy, Daisy, Daisy.","The Great Gatsby starring Robert Redford, Mia Farrow, and Sam Waterston is a pretty interesting adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald classic novel of the same. I like this film, I don't think the movie treads far from the book even though others disagree. The ending is sad and may not satisfy the viewer but hey this is how real life is, no happily ever after. Check this under-rated film out sometime, enjoy!"
1,The Great Gatsby,I was unable to play the DVD as it was for Region 2. I have no idea what that means. I would have liked to know what that meant. Can I exchange it?
1,great gatsby,They sent me european versiion which I did nto realize and I can't retrun it as they do not have U.S. version. Too expensive and time consuming to return for a credit.
1,Yawn,"1. I admit that I'm not sophisticated enough and ""learned"", but the truth must be said, this movie is just a complete bore. If you're interested in the ""The Great Gatsby"", please, do yourself a favor and just read the book."
4,The Great Gatsby (Redford Version),"This film is an especially good representation of the novel, far superior in its veritas to the novel than the vast majority of other novel adaptations. It's worth showing to high school students if they're studying the novel."
4,F. Scott Fitzgerald Classic,A Classic F.Scott Fitzgerald Novel turned into a Good Movie but not great.It is worth viewing and for the Movie Collectors. ****
4,Mark M- period 8 english,"After reading and watching the Great Gatsby in my English class I would have to say that I enjoyed the novel much more than the movie. I think that in the movie version they changed too many things that were important to the story. But overall I think that the director Jack Clayton did a fairly good job. I would have to disagree with many people on these reviews that said that they did a poor job casting. I think that Robert Redford did a phenomenal job as Jay Gatsby as well as Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway. I enjoyed the movie because it really helped me to clarify the time, mood, and setting in which the novel takes place. The Great Gatsby is a story of love, the ""American Dream"", and life in 20's. I suggest that you read the novel if you truly want to capture the essence of story as well as ""Roaring Twenties""."
3,"Well, it had it's high points.....","My english lit class this year as we read the book, and I have to say I was pretty disappointed overall. But like I said, it did have some high points:Sam Waterson was perfect for Nick. It was like he was born for the role. His narroration of Fitzgerald's work makes the words even more beautiful. The actor playing Tom is also perfect, capturing Tom's greed and malice.So what went wrong? Here goes: Mia Farrow gets Daisy's flaky personality, but then goes way overboard. You're ready to punch her lights out in the first 20 minutes. You wonder time and again why in the world Gatsby would ever devote his life to her. Then there's Robert Redford. Is it just me, or does he seem dead in this movie? He never expresses any emotion. But I guess Gatsby is a tough character to play.Overall, I think this book is really difficult to make into a movie. I definitely give them credit for trying. I recommend seeing this version for Tom and Nick's portrayal as characters."
1,Beware VHS Version Without Original Score!,"I too would rate this film MUCH higher if the original musical score was reinstated by Paramount. TV editions still have it, but some music royalty issues scuttled the VHS version, effectively destroying the whole tone of the movie. Without the original film having Irving Berlin's ""What'll I Do"" and a few other '20s standards, the mystical, romantic soul of the movie is banished, and what comes across is a shadow of the original production. If there's ever a DVD version, the original soundtrack BETTER be reinstated, since this is NOT the true film otherwise!"
3,ALLYO Review for Mr. Yochum,After watching The Great Gatsby I felt like I had a better understanding of the book. It was helpful because the movie was not distorted from the book's orginal plot. I felt that the book had more details of the scenes that the movie could not be easily portray. And I think that some parts of the movie dragged on because it was so faithful to every detail of F. Scott Fitzgerald's book. I also saw the 2001 version of The Great Gatsby and I liked the 1974 version better because I think it did a better job of capturing the feeling of the 1920s with the new style of living with the different clothes and the contrast between West Egg and East Egg. The casting was just as I imagined it except I thought them to be older than they looked. At first I did not like Jordan Baker and Daisy's voices but it fit their characters who had voices full of money. Overall I enjoyed this movie and I recommend watching this movie after reading the book.
2,The Book Is Better,"When I saw this I wanted to gag. Literally gag. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. With the exception of Scott Wilson's portrayal of the garage owner Mr. Wilson. In this film version it is impossible to feel sympathy towards in any of the characters, it is also impossible to like any of the characters. Sadly, it gets worse. The score (from what I have heard, in this VHS edition was not the one in movie) was way overdone and overblown. With the back acting and score combined I half expected Jay and Daisy to run towards each other across open fields of wild flowers with open arms. Jack Clayton uses the eyes of Dr. Eckleberg too much, and in doing so the movie loses some of the meaning that the book held. The only reason I gave this movie two stars was because the costumes and sets were wonderfully done."
5,What are you looking for?,"This film is certainly dreamy. What are you looking for? Depending on what you wish to find in this film, you may love it or not. As stated in the main review, the costumes, and sets are breathtaking. Loaded with soft focus shots, the film did a great job of relaying the story- in good detail. By then end of the movie, I am always baffled by the careless nature of the wealthy characters. My only complaint with this film in its present form is the music. Please note that the VHS copy available in stores now does not contain the original score by Nelson Riddle. It has been overdubbed with creepy soap opera like music. This is very disappointing, because the score is FABULOUS! It is one of my favorite records-yes, vinyl. It is only available now used on vinyl. So, if you buy this movie, the soundtrack you will get [is bad]."
1,Gatsby video is altered,"I had not seen the film in many years and recently rented this video. I was shocked to find that the muscial score had been changed. It also appeared to me that the car crash scene had been altered.When I returned to the video store, I looked on the box. In fine print at the bottom it said something to the effect ""Not original music""!I don't know what happened to this picture when it was transferred to video but it's not the same. I'd be interested in hearing if anyone else noticed this and if they know what happened to this movie."
5,A Delightful Read......,"This was a fun book! I couldn't help but smile as I read; joy just bubbles from the pages! Looking forward to putting the book to practical use.I read this book after Doreen Virtue's Healing with the Fairies; both books opened my eyes to an entirely new way of thinking. Also, they helped me to give myself permission to believe in the Elementals."
2,Sound is Terrible,"The sound is really quite horrible. These for the most part are tracks that would be nice bonus material on a CD, but not the featured tracks. Callas is in good voice, but the quality of sound hinders the listener's enjoyment. As I said before, these should have been the bonus material, then one wouldn't feel cheated."
4,Just for the fans....,"The sound is horrible.. but i really like the cd, but is really just for Callas fans.. She sings una voce poco fa Great(as always), the casta diva and butterfly aria is also beautiful.4 stars cos of the singing and the BEAUTIFUL picture on the cover! :-)"
1,This book is not worth the paper it is printed on!,"First all the books that I've bought have had all odd number problems in the back of the book. Well the greedy s.o.b do not put all of the odd answers in the back of the book because these crap heads just want to sell you a student guide that take's another shortcut and does every third problems. When these "" rocket scientists "" know that the professors assigning the home work usually assign the odd numbers when they intently do the problems 1,4,7, and if that's not bad enough they charge you 35.00 for a 1/4 in paperback... I feel violated!!!!"
1,Terrible Text,"This is the worst math text I have ever used. Not only does it not completely explain concepts, it also is very disorganized. Instead of further explaining concepts as they are brought up you are asked to see the ""Remarks"" section. The remarks section is a cluster of material that you must weed through to find the further explanation you are looking for.For 98% of the material in the text I referenced Schaum's Outline for Differential Equations to get more clarity and an in-depth understanding of the material."
4,"This book is very well written, and deserves attention.","I must comment, in the light of the statements made by those that reviewed this book before me, that this book is not what they say it is. Either they did not take into account all of the facts before they made their judgements, or we are reffering to a different book, which I do not believe we are. I am a sophomore mathematics major at Merced College, and I am currently being taught from this book. I believe that this book has great potential because of its readabilty, the scope of its problems, and its attention to applications (realizing that many of the students taking this course are engineering majors). On the other hand, the author could have included a few more proofs, and I realize that the lack of answers to odd numbered problems in the back of the book a legitimate complaint. I do not believe, though, that these minor details are so important that someone would hesitate buying this book because of them."
3,this book is better than others,"I'm using this book for my diff eq class. I think it's good because it has plenty of application problems. I don't like doing math just for the sake of doing math. I like to relate problems to what can be solved with them. As in any math class, you can't learn the stuff by reading the examples like you're reading the newspaper. When it comes down to it you have to spend the majority of your time working problems. This book (sixth edition) does have all odd answers in the back. Maybe this edition is different from earlier ones."
1,"With such an abundance of books on this topic, skip this one","This book lacks the cohesion one is accustomed to in similar texts. The ""modeling applications"" are amotivational, and typically don't explain the real world meaning of the models being used.The text frequently ""explains"" new topics by doing one example, rather than outlining the general case.In short, one can learn how to solve differential equations by using this text, but with such an abundance of material out there, my advice would be to use something else."
2,Please Wake Up,"Many other people have been saying similar things for years....more than 15 or 20 to be exact... I wonder- should you trust the Sirians, or just grow up, and trust yourself? I found it somewhat ridiculous that the overall premise , once again, is us poor little humans are waiting to be rescued, none of our own thoughts are original, all of our thoughts are inserts, blah blah, but the kicker- A far flung planet, (obstensibly in a universe of millions of possible planets !) ""Nebiru"" , which only comes close to Earth every 3600 years, is set to want to rape and plunder our dying polluted and crappy Earth for its own resources....so what do they do the other 3599 years? (duh) And with their ""advanced "" so called civilization, they apparently have not come up with any better ideas in the past few hundred millenia...., really, save this for Scientology....I would say once and for all I AM totally DONE WITH channelled material! Nothing about this trilogy is uplifting."
1,The lies are no secret,"This book is a lie. Everyone knows that the true revelations of Starseed comes from the constellation of the Microscope. They are channelled by Apus Auriga, better known as CHARLES DARWIN in a previous life. There is also Master Celeste a.k.a. EINSTEIN and Master Colombo, whom you know as JOHN F. KENNEDY.Forget about the Sirians. I mean, they are on a first name basis with Robert Temple! Says it all.Here is the message: Pay your income taxes, support your president, and don't be angry with your neighbour's tame zebra. Give FEMA a nice call know and then. Read good books by the likes of Richard Dawkins, Michael Pollan and Jared Diamond. Do not read Temple's books. He's Sirian, remember?And please don't take this review seriously, LOL.PS. You didn't *really* believe what I said about Darwin, right?:-D"
3,did not receive book post office sent it back to sender,Because of a third party the postoffice sent the book back to the sender ommiting me from the loop. I will purchase this book again and now because the issue of the postoffice I will be able to receive it and read it.
5,Essential! Best of the series!,"Don't be put off by the high price! Go to Patricia Cori's website for normal priced ($18 or so after shipping) copies of this book if there are none on amazon...which there NEVER are...being that it is the most damaging to the order it's quite a ""coincidence"" ;)1st half of the book is excellent, practical, essential stuff. 2nd half can be challenging to grasp but is wonderful...and the feeling you get reading the 2nd half is awesome."
2,Read with caution,"She seems very serious. There is a lot of gloom and doom. She says dispose of your microwaves, contact your supermarkets and express your concern, write to your media to petition your objection to subliminal advertising, and she goes on. There is a lot of information here, if true it seems pretty bad and might be good to know. But book reads a little pushy and demanding. If you did some of the things she professess after reading the book people would think you were psycho."
3,Just OK,"The content in this book is WAY too similar to what David Icke and Alex Jones have been saying for years. I honestly thought the information in this book was ""channelled"" and would be something more insightful than just a repeat of the same old story, with ""Dear Ones"" and ""Children"" added in to address the reader. That part was irritating.Otherwise, I recommend it to people who have not yet woken up to the reality of the New World Order, plots of the government, etc. The book overall is a good read."
3,"No More Secrets, No More Lies: A Handbook to Starseed Awakening",Very Interesting but this is one persons opinion. You need to read other authors to form your own opinion. Still a good read. Carol Heidemann.
3,Another View from Another Source,"I would recommend that the reader turn to ""The Song of an Emerald Dove"" by Xanna Vinson for a more spot-on look at our role in tomorrow."
5,Battery lasts forever,"I take this with me on fishing trips just in case I get into trouble and I usually just monitor, It's been 2 years and I still haven't recharged the battery."
4,"Jarrett Lennon, as Joey, steals this movie!","Well, Amazon.com says Belinda Bauer is the star -- if anything, she ruins this movie. But Jarrett Lennon, as ""Joey,"" RUNS this movie, along with Grace Zabriskie (always scary!). ""Joey"" is a really normal little boy, with a lot of intelligence and personality, and is probably the only thing to make this movie look good for Dean Koontz, who should have directed it himself."
3,book way better,"movie very bloody. didn't even really start out like the book. book much better. It started out that the mother & the boy were in the parking lot of Bullocks South Coast Plaza when the evil woman came up to them. At the very time I was reading the book, I was sitting in the parking lot of Bullocks south coast plaza. I worked there & was at lunch sitting in my car. Was VERY creepy.Movie ok. But book way better."
1,"Stinky, stinky, stinky...","Read the book: 5 stars. The movie takes out all that is good in the novel (why do Hollywood dime-a-dozen screenwriters think they have any hope in hell of improving a best-selling novel?!) and completely trashes a great, suspenseful story. Many key elements were either changed or omitted. I would not even waste my time if I were you. Not even if you read the book and are just curious...that's how bad this movie is!"
3,Hollywoods misfortunes,"It is unfortunate that Hollywood cannnot do a writer justice, they usually change the script so repetively that the author's true genius is lost. If Midnight or Lightning had been made into movies Hollywood would have botch them.This movie comes dangerously close to it. Thank God it is only fictional or they would have totally castrated it, as they did with Black Hawk Down and We were soldiers once and young. With the exception of Pixar Studios and a few select films Hollywood castrates everthing they touch. My advice read the books, and carefully choose your movies. I mean how many times have you said aloud, whether you have cable or satelite there is nothing on worth watching. My god look at horrible the news is done, no more true hardball reporting, just reporting for couch potatoes to damn lazy to read the news and get an in depth report."
5,As good as it gets,"_Fanfare_ give this disk a rave review, and I agree: it's the equal of any septet in the catalog out there. The Ensemble Walter Boeykens delivers a performance that is both energetic and sensitive, managing to be light without being flighty, touching without being cloying. A great piece that showcases the Early Beethoven, one hear one foot planted in Classicism, while the other begins to reach towards (what would become) Romanticism. A recent recording, the quality is quite good. Whether you're new to the septets, or familiar with them, this is a worth acquisition...and at this price, there is no reason not to buy."
3,Nice To Know You....GOODBYE,I think this single is lacking because it is nothing really new if you have the Morning View Sessions & Morning View then this Cd isnt really worth it.But it is good music and sound.My favorite track is Nice To Know You (live). but another downfall would be this Cd is not enhanced.It is just a regular CD.I think this Is by far not the best single by incubus.But if you love incubus live like I do then hey this single is really for you.I love incubus but It is very questionalbe about buying.
2,love them but they were old,"Stale product and the zon has no quality control, i wish my lazzy husband would just send me the darn things from Japan."
5,Great Cooking,Great Book... My son is in Boy Scouts and he loves this book. He uses this book to fix us dinner and do the Scout thing. Wonderful book.. Good Eating...
4,Excellent resource...,"This is a great workbook. My only complaint is that the scriptural approach is fairly narrow...so it is very helpful to read the scripture passages in their entirety to establish a context for a fuller and more accurate understanding. But, as it is, it's a thorough personal spiritual inventory that helped me to uncover several areas in my life that needed to change. There are also some great vignettes and stories of martyrs and missionaries...and some church history which is not always pretty.This book is not just for people recovering from sexual addictions, this is a book for any Christian who desires to live a life in full submission to the Lord. It is also a book that will be helpful to men or women. I Highly recommend it."
5,great study!,"I recommend this to anyone who is brave enough to take a close and serious look at his/her life. Some days it was tough seeing the Real Me, but real growth isn't always easy."
2,Wait for it on the SyFy Channel!,"While this documentary does reveal some new and frankly startling information (facts?) near the end, it certainly does not justify watching the beginning and the middle. I would just wait to catch it on cable TV for free!"
1,poor book,"Any body who says this is a ""GOOD BOOK"" didn't pay enough attention. You don't even have to get far in the book before you find mistakes. For instance it says arcs are drawn in a counterclockwise direction but then all the examples are drawn in a clockwise direction. So it doesn't matter if YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT or not the book has mistakes and a lot of them."
2,many mistakes,"Although this book can be helpful it has many many mistakes. The author even makes mistakes on basic computer commands. The examples are often bad with misleading diagrams. I have even found examples that have mistakes in them, they say one thing but do another. I would recommend trying another book first."
5,A fantastic addition to your collection,"I absolutely loved this book! From photographs of the steam engines and the firefighters to production statistics, this book is superb. It even includes reproductions of Operating Manuals for steam engines. If you have any interest in steam pumpers, the history of firefighting or just want an out of the ordinary coffee table book, then this is the volume you sould have!"
1,Mr Sheffield has written better in his sleep,I found this book an enormous disappointment. I generally love Sheffield (Bischoff is also appreciated). However I must say this was one of the few books I refused to finish.
2,Not what is pictured,"Beware, this is not SportDogs materials. The wire and flags are aftermarket. Very dissappointed."
5,AD in Central Washington,"I purchased the wire and flag accessory kit when I purchased the Petsafe Sport dog electronic containment system because I wanted to make sure I had enough wire during installation. I did have enough wire with the start up kit (fenced in approximately an acre) but will save the accessory kit in case I ever move or need to replace the existing wire. I am very satisfied with this containment system and wish I went through the trouble to put it in years ago. Both of my lab mix male dogs (1 year old and 10 year old) were trained in just 3 days after installation. I live in the country and the dogs were starting to bark and chase after the bikers, joggers and most recently the neighbors this system totally put a stop to all of their attitude and now they just bark a bark of greetings from behind their invisible fence."
4,SportDog Wire and flag Kit,"Have installed this ourselves at our summer place, easy to do and seems to be working quite well. There was a little concern about our dog adjusting to a different system, but she's getting the picture. Only complaint is bulky collar..but the cost of replacement batteries really outweighs that concern! (Invisible Fence vs 9 volt). The other reviews really sold us on this specific product."
3,Needs a restoration,"This is a great movie, but the DVD and the movie needs a restoration. If they did that I would give it 5 stars."
1,Not what I wanted,This was NOT what I wanted. I wanted the actual DVD so that I could give it as a gift. I have written to Amazon twice to explain that & gotten no reply. I will never attempt to buy a DVD from Amazon again!
5,Some Like It Hot DVD,"The DVD was in good condition and the film is an absolute classic. While often viewed as a Marilyn Monroe film, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are the real stars. This is a great skrewball comedy full of uncomfortable circumstances and suspension of disbelief. Kids will enjoy the physical humor and adults will enjoy the social aspects."
4,Old School Humor,"I think this movie is a real hoot! Marilyn Monroe is a genius at playing dumb! Jack Lemmon is hilarious in drag and often steals the show and Tony Curtis is...um...well, beautiful! The movie is funny, entertaining, witty and charming. When Jack Lemmon is torn between being a man, AND a woman too, he becomes confused and its extremely funny; his delivery is perfect! Lemmon's performance is comic brilliance!"
2,"Wonderful film, poor transver.","Everyone knows how thoroughly enjoyable this film is, but this blueray transfer leaves a lot to be desired. It is one of the worst I have seen hence the 2 star rating. The blacks are crushed, contrast ratio is very poor and audio is only adequate. The extras are nice but I don't buy discs for the extras, I buy them for stunning video and audio. This disc has neither."
5,Great Comedy,"What a great film. Marilyn Monroe was at her peak, and she shines throughout the film. Both Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis were wonderful. Truly a comedy for all time."
3,Some Like It Hot,"This is a good representation of late 1950's humor. Unfortunately, the transfer itself is filthy. It is littered with white negative dirt to the point of distraction. It really takes away from the viewing experience."
2,DISAPPOINTING DVD,"would've been nice if seller had STATED that this DVD ONLY works in EUROPE!!!! I am in the Southern US, and gave this as a gift to my niece. Imagine my dismay when it would not work IN THE USA!!!! Never was this in the item description. NOT HAPPY!!!!"
5,CLASSIC FILM WITH A NICE NEW DVD UPGRADE!,"I bought the new collector's edition of 'Some Like It Hot' a few months ago and I am just getting around to watching it. The film is a classic with Lemmon, Curtis and Monroe in top form with help from a great cast of character actors. This Billy Wilder film has held up really well and now it's got a worthy release. The new 2 disc edition sports a ton of extras and a fantastic print and transfer!"
5,'Some Like It Hot' : Dizzy Delight,"'Some Like It Hot' is hilarious. It is a movie I saw in the theater when it first came out. It was funny then; it is funnier now. My sister and I watched the movie together and laughed out loud all the way through. We had both forgotten how the movie began and how it ended. It has, as indicated, been a long time! The movie begins with THE shoot-out in Chicago where two musicians get an eyeful of the exits of gangland's worst. The musicians (guys, of course) make their escape from Chicago by going under cover with an all-girl band headed for Miami. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis were in their youthful heydays, both falling for Marilyn Monroe's character, ""Sugar"". Watch it and have fun. It's in black and white for those who prefer their ""drama"" that way."
5,Excellent Movie,"Billy Wilder was a true artist, and this is his best movie, I believe. Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marily Monroe have never been better."
4,One of the funniest films ever,"The reason I gave the product 4 stars is because it was listed as like new but it was more like good or very good. The thing that holds the first disc was broken and detatched, and there was a small hole on the cover. The movie however, is great. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis make a perfect comedic combination along with the sexy and voluptuous Marilyn Monroe. It holds up very well for a comedy from 1959. It just shows no matter how much audiences humor has changed, men dressing up as women will always be funny. This is not just one of the greatest comedies ever, it is one of the greatest movies ever and deserves 5 stars."
2,Mediocrity plus Marilyn,"This film doesn't belong on anyone's top 100. The humor is obvious. It is uncreative. The gags aren't funny. The best thing about this film, and in fact the only thing good about it, is Marilyn Monroe. She's adorable and beautiful. Aside from that, there is no reason to spend two hours with this mediocrity."
3,"Marilyn WOWS, but HOT falls short of 'Classic' status","Saw this for the first time last night. It's so widely lauded that expectations were pretty high. Perhaps that's why I found HOT disappointing. On the positive side of the ledger, there are some chuckles and Marilyn scorches the screen like no one before or since. I also liked Tony Curtis's performance. However, HOT is ridiculous farce that, overall, just didn't do alot for me. There are a number of things that are supposed to be funny that just come off as stupid (e.g. Jack Lemmons 'boyfriend'). The film is so heavy handed with double entendres and sexual innuendo (pretty 'racy' for its day, I'm sure) that it gets tiresome. I also didn't care for Lemmon's over-the-top goofiness through the whole escapade. I'm not completely sorry I spent an hour and a half watching HOT, but I won't be doing it a second time."
1,Classic American Comedy...Classic American Bad Taste,"This film is a five star classic. I remember watching it as a ten year old on Saturday Afternoon Theatre or the like on T.V. and it was a pleasure to see it without commercials for aluminum siding and the transfer seems great to my eye. My objection is with the special features included. The interview with Tony Curtis contains off-color remarks that could have easily been left on the cutting room floor. I'm not a parent myself, but it's seems a shame that a parent couldn't feel comfortable giving a ""tweener"" this DVD to watch and exposing them to a monumental film instead of just more of the same old language and crap that they could see everyday on daytime TV. I guess the ten year olds are now producing the DVDs instead of watching them."
5,Watch this movie!,I just watched this movie on the Turner Classics Movie channel and I love it!!! I couldn't stop laughing all throughout the film. This movie is definitely worth watching more than once!! See it when you're in the mood for a good laugh!!
5,PLEASE watch this movie if you haven't seen it,There is nothing to say. WATCH this movie. There is NO way you will not laugh and love it. Do it. NOW.
5,very good,"i enjoyed the movie very much ,the service was also very goodand i would have no second thought about ordering from here again"
5,LOVE IT!!!,Some Like It Hot is probably one of my favorite classic movies ever! I LOVE IT SO MUCH! you have to watch it. It's so funny and great! Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon did AMAZING jobs as acting like women! No men now a days can ever compete to do that! Watch it! You'll for sure LOVE IT!
5,THE BEST CLASSIC COMEDY OF ALL TIMES,"The first time I saw this movie I was twelve years old. Ever since this movie remains number one on my list of recommendations. It is very original, smart, and funny. Jack Lemmon was at his best. Marilyn Monroe was absolutely gourgeous.Also, check out ""The great race"", another Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis movie, and ""Tootsie."""
5,It's TOOTSIE X 2 !!,"If it can get any funnier than this, I swear I don't know how. Everything about this movie is perfect, the set-up, the characters, the impossible twists... Everything about Some Like It Hot is flawless.Two out-of-work musicians accidently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, and the mob knows that they know too much. Desperate to escape, they join an all-girl band about to leave town for Florida. Now assuming the identies of Daphne and Josephine, romance, the mob and utter confusion collide to create one of the sweetest comedies of all time.Just the ending is worth the price of the film!"
4,What a great older movie,I've watched this a several times and it doesn't get old. My teenage daughter rolled her eyes at first but then got sucked in by the antics. Before long she was laughing right along with me.I really enjoy Tony Curtis anyway and seeing him paired with Jack Lemmon makes this a great movie.
5,Witty and Humorous,"I adore this movie. It is well written, well directed and a well paced story. Billy Wilder writes a very funny script, and gives a brilliant direction in this wonderful screwball comedy. With their energetic yet contrasting personas, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis make an ideal leading pair for a movie of this nature. Joe and Jerry are musicians trying to make a living taking in many jobs throughout Chicago. When they witness a mob hit, they dress up as women and join a women's jazz band headed for Miami. In the band, they meet Sugar, a girl trying to find a nice millionaire to marry. Joe then decides to dress as a millionaire to impress her, but this doesn't impress Jerry who has a real millionaire going after him. When the mob arrives in Miami, madcap mayhem ensures. Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe are all wonderful in possibly their best performances."
5,Great Movie,"Such a classic comedy. My 18 year old daughter actually asked for this movie - she loves it. Great performances by Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe and of course Jack Lemmon."
4,OK,"Love the movies, seen it many time, still want to keep it in one more format. The DVD tranfer quality is so-so. I did not buy the one that has special features, those might be good."
5,You will laugh like you never laughed before!,"My parents made me watch this movie when I was about 10 years old. At first I complained about the black and white, but today I thank them for making me watch this delightful movie. Set in the roaring 20's, it pokes a lot of fun at future events that will soon unravel. Tony Curtis does a spot on match for Cary Grant, Jack Lemmon is so comfortable in drag that is so positively subverse for the 1950's, and Marilyn Monroe has one of her sexiest performances. This movie combines sweetness and slapstick into a raunchy love story. I made all my friends watch it, and some of them never even heard of Cary Grant. Is that possible?!?"
2,"Hot, not so hot.","Really outdated. We had a difficult time even getting this item to play.If you want this film, buy an updated edition"
2,Most over-rated movie in history!,"Vulgar, humorless, heavy-handed embarrassment, Billy Wilder at his worst, to say nothing of Marilyn Monroe. At least Wilder learned his lesson & subsequently used Shirley MacLaine, an actress far more versatile talented & attractive, with Jack Lemmon. The jokes are gross, like those of a loud rich drunken uncle at a gathering of poor relatives. Only the last line is good. This movie defines the absolute opposite of subtlety & good taste."
2,The best ever? I don't think so...,"What was the AFI thinking? Perhaps it was the buildup. Perhaps it was that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis were so good together in ""The Great Race"". For whatever reason, ""Some Like It Hot"" left me cold. While Tony Curtis' Cary Grant imitation was a high point of the movie, and while it had its moments, I can think of many, many comedies (mostly black and white) that far surpass this one."
2,Too fake to be funny,"Perhaps fifty or so years ago this film was hilarious. Perhaps the subject matter was so forbidden and tension-ridden that it kept audiences on the edge of their seats. To me it just came across as fake, the Jack Lemmon-Tony Curtis comedy ludicrous (and annoying), and the scenarios so dated as to be dull. It just didn't work, and I ended up only watching about half of it. That was a real disappointment. I'd been expecting more.One strength, however: Marilyn Monroe was excellent. This is the first time I saw her great acting. I watched `The Seekers' some years ago and didn't think much of her. Here, however, she was just lovely: sweet, vulnerable, honest, lost, and charming. Although I have no idea if I'm really right, I sensed she was just playing her real life self. Regardless, she really had skill. Too bad it wasn't put to better use."
2,Great but stroller fabric ripped in 2 months!,"I got this stroller as a shower gift, as my original stroller that I wanted was discontinued. That being said, this stroller was easy to assemble and great to use until I noticed that the fabric is starting to rip! I don't why that happened, this stroller was only used for 2 months and NOT on a daily basis, maybe once or twice a week. Anyways thank goodness that babies r us was willing to return it and let us get another one. I wouldn't recommend it now as the fabric is quite flimsy and that is not good considering it almost cost $200 for the system. Buy at your own risk....."
3,Good value,"For the price this is a good value for a stroller/car seat combo. After using it for a couple of years, the rear wheels have really worn down. Other than the wheels, it is also a little hard to collapse. I do like the ergonomic handles."
5,So Convienent!!,"with my first child i had bought a HUGE(eddie bauer) travel system that took up my entire trunk space. in the end i would only bring it with me if i REALLY needed it for long outings or if there were no men to carry the carseat by hand. but this stroller is NOT bulky, heavy, or a hassle to bring with you. it amazes me how small it folds up(like an umbrella stroller), but it is still able to hold a carseat. i WISH i had this with my first child, life would have been much easier on my right arm(the one i used to carry the carseat. This stroller eliminates the need to buy more than one stroller(i had bought three). its functional and easy to maneuver whether you're at the grocery store, park, or an amusement park! i would recommend this to ANYONE."
4,So Far So Good.,"Although my son isn't born and haven't been able to use it first hand with him, I would rate this stroller highly. I like the maneuverability, and seems like it would be quite easy to make way through a store with narrow aisles. I also am in love with the color. Its black and a deep reddish burgandy. It's not as red as it looks in the picture. The contrast between the burgandy, black, and silver makes the stroller look ""cool"" not ""cute"". The Carseat clicks in really easily without much effort. The opening of the stoller doesnt take much effort either. The problems that I have found are that the breaks on the wheels are really hard to get undone, and it is kind of a pain in the butt to collapse. Once you get the hang of it though, it gets easier.Overall the design, functions, and colors are great and over look the two pain in the butt problems. I would totally recomend this stroller."
2,"Pretty pictures, little else","This is basically a ""coffee table book"" of pictures of bayonets. If you are looking for any depth of information on bayonets, look elsewhere."
4,Bayonet: An Illustrated History,Nice book. Excellent pictures which are very helpful whenn identifying items. Also text is well written. Some interesting bayonets are missing in this book.
4,"Lively, thoughtful, entertaining","Billson fluently weaves together the whole seven-season tale, flavoring it with her personal viewing history and good connections to related fiction in books, movies and tv shows. Thematic discussions blend in smoothly; for example, a short section on ""The Wish"" opens up to include alternative reality in other episodes and outside this series. Billson has a good eye for the dramatic aspects of the episodes and seasons; from this perspective, Season 7 gets high marks; Season 4 doesn't. This Buffy fan found the book lively, thoughtful, and entertaining."
4,All in One Good Voice,"Too bad this one wasn't released in America. Tyler sounds wonderful mixing interesting covers, celtic flavor, and her reliable rock songs. It's nice to hear her singing more about love and less about lust. Highlights are the single ""Heaven"", the upbeat ""You Always Saw the Blue Skies"", and ""He's the King"". A great step towards a mature and exciting future for Tyler. This review written by Trent"
4,Bonnie Tyler Does It Again!,"As usual, Bonnie's vocals are amazing! I just really miss hearing a powerful Jim Steinman song on this album, but HE'S THE KING is close. This is a MUST for any Bonnie Tyler fan!"
4,"Worth reading, lots of information","The author is clearly anti-surgery. He repeats this over and over again...a little too often, really. However, his position is backed up by a lot of hard facts.The author definitely favors radiation as a preferred option when surgery is the other main choice. He makes a strong case that radiation has a similar treatment efficacy and fewer side effects. There isn't much in the book about nutritional therapies.I found it definitely worth reading. Most urologists seem to favor surgery as ""the gold standard"". However, after reading this book and checking out the research upon which it bases its conclusions, surgery definitely seems to be oversold."
4,Any new Anita Kerr CDs?,"This album is not bad. Far from the best of AK, but it's about the only CD from her work. I give it 4 stars because it's AK. I hope 'they' would produce more CDs from the vast selection. Anyone knows why there are practically no Anita Kerr CDs?"
4,"Olmecs, Aztecs and Mayans","Amazing how much the Aztec culture was like those in Egyptand the Middle east, from monolithic religious architecture tobeastly religious practices and tribute empires.The Aztec calender is discussed. A 52 year cycle much like thatin Kondratieff economics is mentioned as well.Similarities between Egyptian pictorials of executionsand Aztec ones is an illustration. There is also some discussion of therelationships of the different civilizations that were related to the Aztec that was prevalent when the Spanish invaded."
3,not to bad ;,I would rather buy next time ; Just a good quality protein by Healthy n fit or Optimum Nutrition . I feel from experience it would be a better choice !
3,Mildly entertaining.,"I wish this CD included more of Canova's ""fun"" songs. She was best known for her fun-loving style, so I expected fewer ballads and more happy-go-lucky selections."
2,Fact not Fancy,"From the first few pages it is clear to the reader that the author is living in a fantasy land. Instead of global democracy the world should ban together to get Charles Derber some basic economics lessons and a magic wand. The only redeeming quality is the basic message if you can get past the writting style, the less that complete grasp of international economics and how his ideas contradict each other."
1,One of the best examples of poor editing,"I'll have to say, whoever is proof reading and editing these novels over at Pocket Books must have English as a third language. I lost track of all the incorrectly spelled words, mis-use of words, and sentences that made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I guess they must be sending the proofing overseas.Was the story compelling? Well, no, not really. It read like a bad episode of the series, except for the swearing that they can't use on CBS."
3,Less Flashy,"Catherine and Nick are working a case involving child pornography found in the print out tray at an advertising agency. Sara and Warrick work on the death of the secretary to the mayor of Las Vegas. I didn't like this one as much as I did the three previous CSI books. There is a lot of technical computer speak which many people might find interesting, but I thought was a little tedious. There was less humor too. I especially missed the frequent dry wit displayed by Gil Grissom in previous outings. All in all, it was less flashy, but still an entertaining read."
2,The show is better than the book,"I don't ordinarily come down on the side of video over print, but in this case, I must. I bought this novel at the airport, read it on the plane, and still find myself tempted to copyedit it and send it back to the publisher with red pen markings aplenty. Folks who watch CSI are smart enough to want books that are intelligently crafted and carefully edited. I couldn't make it through three pages of this one without finding a typo or some other bush-league mistake. The characters should give life to this tale, but they lie flat on pages riddled with errors. Yawn."
3,"If you like the T.V. show, you'll like the book.","If you like the T.V. show, you'll enjoy this book. I do and yet I still had trouble keeping everyone straight for the first half of the book. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the book.The author has really captured the characters from the t.v. show and expanded on them. He has also captured the forensics aspect.In this book Janice Denard begins to prepare for an ordinary day, but when she gets to work she discovers shocking photographs let abandoned in a printer. The CSI computer forensics expert helps the CSI team of Willows and Stokes track through hardware and software to find the culprit.Grissom, Brown and Sidle uncover disturbing evidence in the brutal murder of the Mayor's secretary that has been missing. The media is all over this case, and the Sheriff who is running against the Mayor has to remove himself from the case.There are a lot of twists and turns as the evidence leads them to the perpetrators in each case.I recommend this book."
3,Average,"I am rating this just ""average"" because although it covers many aspects of fusing, it gives very few actual details needed to do a fusing project. It is a good overview of the process. I just wish there were more details.Also, hitting the rewind takes you all the way to the beginning; there is a pause button to use but you cannot rewind if you missed what they are saying."
5,Best Wallet Made,"As long as they make it, this is the only wallet I will buy. Very high quality and it can take a lot of abuse! My first one was as a gift and I have had 2 more. I'm really pleased to see that Rolfs is still making this wallet. Suggest you also purchase the ten slot plastic ""credit card holder"" if you want to carry additional credit cards or pictures."
3,Stroboframe Folding Flip Bracket,Easy to use the flip but too short to use the bracket with a power-pack attached under a DSLR. Still one of the best for the price.
4,"WAR OF NERVES ,IS:......",GREATEST R'&'B TRACK ON THE ALBUM I THINK.IT'S A CALM NUMBER GOOD FOR A ROMANTIC DINNER OR SOMETHING VERY ROMANTIC.I LOVE IT.......MONDAY ON THE LINE..........LOVE SANDRA
5,When She Sings It's Over,"If you were to order this import, no matter the cost, only for the title track - 'Minerva' - I would understand utterly and completely, because even with only three tracks, this song is so utterly gorgeous that it's worth it. As something that evokes strong emotions in everyone, while most universally agree on its beauty, it's a hidden gem in the world. I would recommend this song to any living, breathing person on earth, and say it with my held held high. If you haven't heard 'Minerva', then you need to."
3,Deftones- Minerva,"This is a fairly good CD single, as it contains two non-LP tracks. Since most people who would even consider getting an import CD single by Deftones probably already has Minerva, I will just review the two extra tracks.Sinatra (15/15) This is an awesome track with heavy, suspenceful sounding riffs and somewhat resembles an early Korn song. I am not sure whether it is a cover or not (I found a website that listed it as a Helmet cover), but whatever it is, it is good. Very satisfied with this one.Sleep Walk (6/15) I am very dissapointed with this. I was expecting another killer track like Sinatra, but what I got was a jazzy 2 minute guitar tune with no lyrics. It sounds like something they play in a 40's restaurant. I guess it's good for what it is, but I don't like it.I gave this single three stars. 5 for Sinatra, 1 for Sleep Walk. That averages to 3."
1,"K-Tel, go to ...............","I was enticed by a wonderful playlist into buying this CD. At ONE CENT, it was OVERPRICED!The front cover of the disc (not visible here) warns the unwary that all of these great old tunes are modern-day re-recordings. It seems all that was necessary in the minds of the producers to label these songs as done by the ""original artists"" was that a SINGLE original member of each group needed to be present.Imagine ""The Beatles"" with ONLY Ringo there at the recording session, or the ""Berlin Philharmonic"" consisting of a roomful of hacks and the original triangle player-- that's about the size of what you get here.Thirty years ago, K-Tel was a label you could trust. These days, it seems all you can trust them to do is ruin your fond memories of classic old Top 40 music. Thanks for nothing, guys! (By the way- I sent my copy of ROCK AND ROLL PARTY to the municipal landfill. May it rest in pieces.)"
2,From social worker to Schwarzenegger,"Chains of Gold is one of those movies John Travolta did during his career slump. This one has Travolta as Scott Barnes, a social worker who rescues a kid from a drug-running street gang. Hector Elizondo has a part as Lieutenant Ortega. Silly plot certainly doesn't help this forgettable action movie. Director Rob Holcomb moved on to direct the excellent TV movie 'Finding the Way Home'."
3,Unsure of the audience,"If you're a nerd and want to dig into diving physics, then its a pretty good book. I can't see this book helping tech divers, nor can I see this book being used as a text to teach diving physics to future researchers in the area {poorly organized, and it doesn't have a consistent idea of the target reader's education level. . . in some areas he's teaching algebra, in others he's assuming you have an doctorate in gas-tissue dynamics}.Wienke is definitely (one of) _the_ expert(s) in this field, and to be sure $40 is a steal for this ""textbook,"" but only if your goal with the book is to really nerd it up about diving physics."
2,Won't turn on a padded chair,I was hopeful that this would be a big help on all my chairs but didn't think about them being padded. When you sit down the seat sinks in the padding and then it won't turn. It is still very comfy to sit on but won't help me to turn easily.
5,Swivel Seat,"Purchased this product due to my husband chronic health issues. He has a hard time getting in and our of our vehicles, and this product has made it much easier for him to do so now."
2,Hard to sit on,This pad may be ok for helping someone swivel to get out of a car but it is hard to sit on. More padding would help but probably make it to high.More of a nuisance than a help for me.
3,Duro Med swivel seat cushion,"It was too large to fit properly in bucket seat,would not turn easy due to snug fit, not easy to slide off of material, a small lady had hard time turning it. It was purchased for car , did not see any instructions on how best to use. If put on a hard flat surface ,would be fine, quality of material was good, just not right for job I wanted it for. Passed it forward."
5,Great Product That really Works,I purchased this for my 87 year old mom who has trouble getting in and out of the car. Works great. She is on the heavy side and I was concerned that it would not work and would be uncomfortable. She is very happy with it.
1,Sorry I bought this.,"Needed for my wife in our car. Really does not function well, sorry I ordered it."
3,swivel seat,"I use the swivel seat in my car. It does help some, but not as much as I had hoped that it would. You have to enter your car by sitting sideways, but then you still have to try to get your legs and feet into the car after turning the small amount that you can on the swivel seat."
2,Not what I expected,"Using this cushon as a passenger is great. Using it as the driver is not what I expected. Since most cars have bucket-styled seats, the cushion slips from place. I'm constantly readjusting it and when I find the right spot it only lasts until I get out of the car. The cushioning is minimal making it too hard for long trips."
2,A little disappointing,"The swivel seat arrived on time, and is, for the most part, what the manufacturer has promised. I find it a little too hard to sit on, and to use it in the car, one has to be a rather short person or have a very tall car. I am apparently too tall, because it brings me up right under the roof of the car, which is not comfortable, plus there was no room for my knees under the steering wheel. I very recently had back surgery, so this was my main purpose for buing the seat, to make it easier to get in and out of the car. Now I use it on a dining room chair by the table."
4,Quite a picture of the place and times,"A good picture of what the world was like for Ms Stein in Culoz. Her prose, of course, is a challenge to read."
4,Counter Culture Classic,"This film, along with a few others, managed to capture that moment in history when a counter culture emerged during the 1960's and early 1970's. Needless to say, it made many in the ""Establishment"" nervous. The drug scene was a bit overblown but the long haired prejudice was all too real."
5,Current 93 at some of their best work,"This CD contains my personal favorite ""The Cat is Dead"" which is a abstract song that appears, on the surface, to be about the love kittens but I take it to mean a comment on God's saddism throughout the world.If you are a C93 fan or are thinking about trying this, I'd have to say this is the 2nd best album to go with, the best choice being ""The calling For Vanishing Faces"" album and I really have to insist that ""Beauty Reaps the Blood of Solitude"" by ""Nature & Organization"" (aka Current 93) is another MUST HAVE release."
5,Great Gift for the one you love/,"Got this watch for my husband's birthday, he loves it. we don't dive, but we kayak and saltwater fish alot. This watch has held up great and it looks phenominal on his wrist. He has big hands and if you have a small wrist or small hands this will probably look too big. I have the Womens version and I love it as well. I am quite petite and the watch is even a littl bulky for me, but a man can wear the womans watch I think."
1,Cheesy RE-recordings of hits--STAY AWAY from this set!,"I don't know why record labels bother with albums like this--even K-tel, which is known for ""cheesy"" compilations. It would be nice if it at least said right on the front cover that it's a bunch of re-recordings (some not even by the original artists), but it only says it at the very bottom of the back cover. It's clear when one sees an album like this that the label is just trying to snare the unsuspecting record buyer...but why bother when nobody who's ever heard the original versions would be satisfied with a collection like this? The only thing I can figure is that this is K-Tel trying to capitalize on the recent wave of ""tribute album mania,"" and they figure that if they make it cheap enough people won't mind...but if that's the case, say right up front what the album is, instead of trying to fool consumers!"
2,Superficial,Briefly discusses several sub topics related to the main topic of the book. The book gives an introduction to the technolgy without going into any real depth.
3,A collection of research papers,"Not very readable and not much use to a worried step-parent. As a review of research it now suffers from age - 1987 publication. It might be of use if you are doing a research paper and want some early references. To be fair it's better than some of the other books on remarriage, which are inspirational or first person with little solid fact."
5,Very informative,"My wife found this to be very well written. It was recommended to her, and she was not disappointed with the knowledge she obtained from it."
4,EASY TO READ AND INFORMATIVE,"KIDS HELPING KIDS is an easy to read presentation of children telling their stories of sexual abuse. The reader is witness to the frustration, shame, guilt, anger and hopelessness which permeates their lives. Its intent is to inform the public how pervasive a problem it is, to outline tell-tale signs for spotting such abuse, and to awaken awareness in victims of abuse on how to deal with the secrets they are hiding."
5,Our Brave Men Who Endured,"My father told me about his cousin who was starved to death in a Japanese Prisoner of War Camp, and I know that few men survived this experience. How great it is to hear the story of one man who persisted and was determined to escape the final day as the Japanese killed the prisoners. The story told here, complete with descriptions of the men he knew and how they struggled with the extreme cruelty of the Guards and Officers of the Japanese, show us how this history should never be forgotten. Once you start the book, you will find it hard to put it down."
5,Never forget!!,"I am a family member of a sailor lost in the war. My uncle died before I was born so searching his fate led me to meet some of his shipmates 40 years later. For that reason I have a deep interest in Jap POW's experience. What these men endured is unthinkable. We never know the depths of cruelity that exist in the world. That is what makes it important to read books like this, to honor those who are buried over there and those few left today."
1,War is Hell,"This book had special relevance to me as my uncle was one of the POW's at Palawan who did not survive the Japanese internment. The facts of how and when they were captured shed light on the chronology and daily hardships they encountered as slave laborers. The cruelty and starvation inflicted by the guards at the camp were incredible.As a U.S. Marine Vietnam veteran it was always my resolve to NEVER be captured alive should it have happened. This story exemplifies why. Being alive in a POW camp was NOT living.This book is very interesting, a good read, and one you cannot put down until the very last page. The cross-section of American men who lived and died is remarkable."
5,A Great Story of a Survivor,This is a great story of a survivor who makes it and also the story of others who perish. All of whom are heroes under conditions we hope will never again be faced by POW's. This book tells the story of their sacrifice which should never be forgotten.
5,This should allways be a reminder of our fathers sacrifices,I could not put it down. I really liked the book. I meet Mr. McDole and his wife this last June. What an amazing family and how he over came tragidy.
2,Too rigid,"It's a good shape and has great contours. However, I found the entire surface too stiff and it not very helpful."
2,I Agree: Not Much of a Classic,"I agree completely with the reviewer who called this book Not Much of A Classic.Mr. Decker does simply make up new names for well established strategies andwriting techniques. Mr. Decker gave a talk at a local library in Las Vegas not longago, and the poster announcing his talk called this book a best-seller. Oh, really?On what list would that be?Mr. Decker's book is loaded with typos. It doesn't appear as if he or anyone elseeven did a very good job of proofreading it. This is the kind of book anyonecould quickly put together in minimal time.Don't bother"
5,For Lakers fans!,The DVD tells the story of another Lakers great year.Fantastic accounting.Good and interesting footage.I do recommend it!
3,Lost along the way?,"The director's idea --a setting/language shift of a Jim Thompson novel-- was clever, but somehow gets lost. Was he trying for black humor, or was he simply confused? Instead of the hero devising some clever comeuppance for his many tormentors, he becomes inexplicably psychotic. Then he seems to try to justify it with a nihilistic (but impeccably Gallic?) shrug --that the whole world believes in nothing, so why shouldn't I?But the film definitely has its moments, and the great Isabelle Huppert."
3,An excellent but difficult film - Coup de Torchon,"Philippe Noiret's character, quintessentially French, sardonic, funny and witty is sometimes overwhelmed by the pace and setting of this film. The underlying themes and metaphors ultimately, if uneasily, resolve but the hugely funny slapstick elements superimposed on the murderous mayhem is a difficult balance."
4,It's more unnerving than you think,"Nobody seems to have mentioned it yet, but this film can easily be read as a goof on the Second Coming of Christ. After doing not a damn thing for years to help humanity or bring justice and peace, Christ shows up one day, kills ""the bad guys,"" and creates ""his own paradise."" Didn't see it? Watch again, and be prepared, if you are a believer, to be disturbed."
3,"good scenery, but not very interesting.","This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Coup de Torchon, known also as ""Clean Slate"" is better translated as ""Wipe of the Cloth"" as a cloth would clean a slate chalkboard.This film is set in the year 1938 on the eve of World War II and is about a recist white policeman in Senegal, (then called French West Africa) who always looks the other way when a crime is committed. One day he goes berserk and starts killing people.I found this movie to be boring but loved the scenery of the village.The DVD has a US theatrical trailer for a special feature along with an interview with the director and an alternate ending presented by the director."
5,"Chilling, Funny Neo-Noir Masterpiece","This is the film version of Jim Thompson's dark comedy ""Pop. 1280"" transplanted from Texas to French-colonial Africa. Noiret is the secretly-smart sherriff who slowly goes insane from the brutality and backwardness of the life he is forced to endure. Huppert is dang sexy as the woman who helps triggers the violence. Brilliant film switches back and forth from dark humor to horror: it keeps you guessing and on edge. Yes, you could say it is a mix of Kafka, Beckett, and good old-fashioned American madness, with a Gallic accent. Over the years this sly but scarifying movie has become one of my favorites."
3,Falls Flat,"Not a bad film, but having read the book, I just couldn't enjoy it. If I had not read the book, I think I would have found it boring and pointless.Not a bad idea transferring from the American badlands to Senegal, but as one reviewer said, ""something was lost in translation."" I'm not sure if the filmmaker did it on purpose, or if he just did not understand how much of the book's appeal is based on the cultural stereotypes and traditions of the novel: the tall tale (the sheriff is an out-sized character, ravenous in his appetites for food and sex...and, he is very handsome!); the humorous short piece a la Mark Twain, and so on. The book has a crazy, darkly humorous drive from its use of colloquial speech, stock 'hick' characters, etc. None of that comes through. Instead, we get a 'French artistic' meditation on humanity. Same theme, but the style is way off..."
4,Another great slipping through the cracks,"I know little of Julian Dawson, save for a brief exposure to his work with Plainsong, but this is superbly crafted release, aided immeasurably by erstwhile Byrd, Gene Parsons. Poignant and varied, sung beautifully by Julian, with some great harmonies from Gene and his wife Meridian. Great drumming from Gene too."
5,Voces Romanticas,Canciones de amor al compas de dos guitarras y un requinto muy especial que nos traen recuerdos de lo que el hombre siente por una mujer.
5,the father of portuguese rock,Rui veloso was and still is the greatest portuguese composer of rock balads. These album shows only a small piece of his entire talented work that inspired and captured the heart and soul of the portuguese people.
4,Great Birthday Party ideas!,"We used this little book as the basis for a flower fairy birthday party for a six year old, and it was a huge success, and considerably less expensive than renting Little Gym or another insitutional party place.We made several decorations and the gorgeous flower fairy wands.All of the projects would probably require adult assistance for a child under 10, but they are really lovely and worth any effort."
5,Funniest movie I've seen in a long time!,"I laughed until I could hardly breath. I don't often buy DVD's but when this one comes out, I certainly will. For all the people who say it could never happen, well of course it could never happen. It's fiction--I knew that going into it. The stuff she does is so crazy and the cuteness with which she does it is what makes the movie. A definite must see!"
5,Great movie,Just saw this movie. I simply LOVED Kate Hudson and Matthew in this comedy cos they made me laugh like mad. My husband and me really really found the story to be entertaining and damn funny!!!!A MUST see for all comedy movies lovers
3,maid for chick flick Hollywood product: romantic comedy,"The hunk Matthew McConaughey as B.B. and Kate Hudson as A.A.:they just used the plot characters A and B to get a device wherehe has a bet and she has an article to writeso they endure each other past the first few days of crazy stuff.Kate Hudson wears some amazing dresses that wouldn't have passed the old censors, but there is remarkably little real sex on screen here.I liked the movie: it is good light entertainment, butnot real acting I suppose. People (mostly young females?) go to these to forget their own real world problems. I just can't give the movie ahighrating as it is very predictable."
5,How to Lose a Guy in 10 days.,"I started watching the movie on TV a time ago, and was interuppted before the end of the movie and never knew how it ended. I was never able to find the movie again, so I was very happy to be able to buy the DVD from Amazon. I loved the movie!"
4,Smile and laugh as you saunder through this movie,"This movie is coy, humorous and so much fun to watch, from several different view points. It is a feel-good movie too. The energy between these two, and the plot, will keep you on your toes throughout the movie.. It is a keeper for sure...."
4,Nice easy to watch romp,"Predictable, but fun. Not a bad movie for a low stress Saturday night. Couple has good chemistry and we enjoyed it."
1,"Terrible, terrible, shameful movie","Almost unwatchable, so bad it made me angry. The entire movie is Hudson mocking what are cliche chick mistakes in dating. Both lead characters were just total unbelievable jerks and very contrived, and would never recover from the anti-seducing they do to each other. No subtlety, very irritating jokes. I somehow hung in to the end and the one part that was worth watching was the pretend Debeers dinner."
4,"A wildly funny, frothy movie...","""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days"" was really a lot of fun. I cant remember the last time I really howled while watching a movie..Kate Hudson was absolutely hysterical in this. I thought that she and Matthew M. had fantastic chemistry..is it deep and meaningful??? No...but it is a hell of a good time..Id recommend it in a second."
5,funny is as funny does,this movie was a2 hysterical new twist on romantic comedies. a chick flick guy's will truly enjoy.
5,Perfect comedy to watch with your girlfriend,"This movie is coming out in the Netherlands May 28th, but I watched it already. It's a great movie to watch with your girlfriend. I'm ready to watch it a second time in the movie theatre again soon."
4,Go Kate!,"The storyline itself indeed, has been done before, and yet this is a fantastic movie.I loved every minute of it.Why is this?The acting was superb!I absolutely adore Kate Hudson. She is cute, beautiful,sexy , sensual , funny and clever-I love those eyesAnd I can surely see why a guy would stick by her, whatever she did to try make him leave her.Even when she tries to be irritating she is cute, unlike so many others who try to be cute but are irritating &#61514;Her role as Andie Anderson is a masterpiece.Matthew McConaughey (who plays advertising executive Ben Barry) is also a superb actor, whose easy arrogance, is carried off well, if not somewhat unnerving.Highly watchable, and extremely funny.Particularly memorable are the scene with the 'psychologist' and the verbal catfight on stage between Andy and Ben.Another noteworthy performance is that of Andie's best friend Michelle byKatharyn Hahn - she gives an earthy and hilarious performance."
4,Excellent except for one niggling piece (spoilers),"I walked out of this film very happy to have seen it, but with a small feeling that something didn't seem right with the ending. After quite a bit of thought it was this: we never got to see his transformation from bet to love. Just one little bit of dialogue with a friend would have made this movie complete for me. The actions eventually were there, but when did he leave the bet behind and realize that it was no longer his motivation? I would have liked to have seen that moment. I wouldn't let this gripe keep anyone from the movie. I even plan to buy it."
5,A must see for everyone,My husband & I went to see How to Lose a Guy in 10 days together. There aren't many movies we both really enjoy. This one was the exception. We were both laughing out loud during the entire movie. We've agreed this is a definate DVD to add to our collection.
3,GHOSTS OF DAY AND HUDSON,"This entertaining if unmemorable film harkens back to the sixties romantic farces of Doris Day and Rock Hudson, with Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey adequately filling their shoes. She plays a magazine writer who makes a bet that she can lose a guy in ten days while he plays an ad exec who makes bet he can make someone fall in love with him in the same time period. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where the plot is heading, but the leads are engaging and there are some laughs along the way. Kate is more like her mom (Goldie Hawn) than in previous films and McConaughey has a masculine charm that complements Hudson's blondeness. It's certainly not Oscar caliber, but it's entertaining nonetheless in its own breezy way."
3,Funnny But Lacks Chemistry--,"I love the the humor in this movie-- I own the DVD and watch it often. I still laugh everytime I see Kate and Matthew come back from the Celine Dion concert. The jokes and the scenes in this movie are hiliarious!But, this typical chick flick lacks is chemistry between Matthew and Kate.--You feel little to no connection in the film and after a while you wonder why-- the ended up together even after the weekend with Matt's parents.Of course- it is part of the bet they made to go out and systmatically go out and destroy eachother's lives. The story is predictable and Matthew in my opinon is the actor that lights up the screen- really it's Hudson who fails to deliever.The company should have kept Matthew and have dumped Hudson-- what this movie needed to recieve 5 stars is more chemistry. Rent this one-- be4 buying!!!"
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!,"Last year, I kind of had 2 B-Day parties, one with like, 28 people (my actual party), and one with 3 freinds (which was on my real B-day). On my real B-day, my parents usually let me have a sleepover where we go to dinner and a movie, and that year, they did. We went to Hops, and then went to see this movie. Just pictue four 12 year olds, an 8 year old, and the B-Day girl's parents going to see this movie. We all loved it! It was such a funny, fun movie! As the movie ended, all I could say was definate buyer!!!"
3,Too much twinkle,"Too much twinkleKate Hudson is cute, cute, cute - but methinks she twinkles too much in her attempts to be the cute daughter of cute Goldie Hawn.This is a fluff-nutter of a movie with some good lines and some very funny scenes, but it's not going to have staying power. It's the equivalent of a very light summer beach read. The premise is silly: Hudson, a mag writer in NY, is assigned to date a guy and deliberately do all the things that drive guys nuts and send them scurrying away fast, fast, fast. The hooker: she's picked Matthew McConaughey, an ad exec who has accepted a bet at very high stakes that he can make a women fall in love with him in 10 days.Of course, you already know how it ends; this is light romantic fodder, after all. Sure, watch it with some gal pals - but don't look for it on Oscar night, that's for sure."
1,How To Lose Your Lunch In Five Minutes,"I don't know if there has been a more disapointing film in years. I sat for two hours and NEVER LAUGHED. Every funny gag the movie had to offer I had seen in the trailer! Since the advertisment for this film (and I use that word loosley) had been so frequent on television, those jokes were no longer funny. Boring, predictable and stupid. My wife and her mother and sister found it funny so I would say that maybe JUST MAYBE it is a girl thing and I just don;t understand. Still, I found this to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time."
2,IF it was not by that silly ending...,"If it was not by that silly ending, maybe my rating would have been higher. After all, both actors tried their best to make this comedy work, a comedy that was flawed from its inception: why would Hudson character need to do that in order to write an article? It would have been enough to interview girls and guys.Anyway, there are a lot of good parts (the ""Princess Sophia"" thing is hilarious). Only that bloody ending ruined it all..."
5,Liz in Wisconsin,Great movie. very funny-- it isn't a likely to happen movie. However it is parts of relationships all put together into one. I think it was very funny and Hudson and Matthew M. worked well together. Highly recommend
5,the best romantic comedy in a long time,"This movie is for the young and old, male and female. Everyone will enjoy it. When I went to go see it in the theater everyone was laughing and there were young and old people there. If you like romantic comedies this movie is highly recommended. I liked this movie because it was really funny and it is a great romantic comedy. This movie will have everyone laughing. This movie it soo good that it is worth going to go see more than once. I am definatly going to buy it when it comes out on DVD. Everyone should go see it, male and female. You will get your money worth."
1,McConaughey Hudson Garbage,The best part of this movie is Kate Hudson in a bikini and the other little chick in a bikini. The rest is pure garbage. This is the kind of garbage that McConaughey and Hudson will churn out over and over and over even though neither can act. This movie is sToOpId.
2,How to Alienate Your Audience Within 10 Seconds.,"I turned this movie off after about 20 minutes because the prospect of sitting through this whole mess was rather depressing.There is not a single likeable character in this movie. The script is disjointed, shallow, and unengaging. The premise itself makes no sense--what if the ""Guy"" in question completely ignores Andie after the first encounter/date? What then?I'd point out specific flawed instances in this movie, but I don't want to put in the effort for such a meaningless film.Don't watch this. There's nothing enjoyable about it at all, and I haven't met a single person who liked it, myself included."
4,"funny, funny, funny ... and true!","I found this movie very funny, especially because it talks about some of the stuff it talks about (the teddy bears, the photos, the luvy duvy talk) really does make men nervous. I'm married now, but I used to be single and so I know what I am talking about.I have to admit something, and that is that the movie is not anything serious. You would probably guess that, but I don't want people saying they thought it was serious. But if you feel like a good, funny movie to watch when you are tired after work one day then, yup, this is a good one.On the DVD, the extras are also nice, like the trailers. They also divide the chapters in a logical way, so it is easy to jump to the right scene. I like that."
4,Fresh Comedy,"I don't usually like romantic comedies, as mostly they are too sentimental and cheesy for my personal liking,but I was pleasently surprised with how much I enjoyed How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.The story, production and acting are all good, and the film is an old fashioned entertainment flick that keeps a smile or two on your face throughout its appx 110 minutes. However, what distinguished this film from dozens or so romantic comedies is Kate Hudson.She made me enjoy the movie much more than I thought I would, and it is her best role to date, an actress who has matured well on screen,who is very pretty,cute, fresh, with a contagious smile that lights up the screen.It is so easy to fall in love with this movie just for Kate Hudson alone, not in ten days, but in ten minutes..easily!"
2,A really long two hours,"I had never seen a preview for this movie before I went to see it, I didn't even know what it was about. I figured it had to be good though because I really like Kate Hudson (despite the fact that she never wears a bra) and I adore Matthew MacConeghy (despite the fact that I can't spell his last name). The first 45-60 minutes of the movie were pretty funny, after that it really began to drag and I wished it would end. It was sad to see two very talented and attractive actors with such possibility for chemistry, go to waste on such a bad script. I give the movie 1 3/4 stars."
4,Fun romantic comedy,"This movie is better than I expected it would be. Kate Hudson plays a magazine writer whose boss requires inane articles from her when she would rather write about something more serious. She agrees to write an article on ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" so that her editor will then allow her to write something more substantial. Meanwhile Matthew McConaughey is trying to win a lucrative diamond account for his advertising firm by making a girl fall in love with him in 10 days. When these two meet, the sparks begin to fly as they carry out their opposite agendas. There are quite a few funny scenes and Hudson and McConaughey create some nice chemistry in the scenes they have together. Watching this DVD is a fun way to spend an evening."
5,A delicious slice of comedy,"Ever see a commercial for a movie and before you even see it you know you're going to love it? That is how I felt about ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 days."" Kate Hudson shines, and Matthew McCounaughey has that perfect masculine thing going on. This movie was so good! There really isn't anything else to say except that it was hilarious and well worth the money. Seriously-you HAVE to get this."
4,Cute romantic movie,"I'm spending my summer renting DVDs like a nutjob. I rotate between dark and dramatic, random indies and silly lighthearted affairs. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days falls in the ""silly lighthearted affairs"" category, but that's not to say it is a bad movie.How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a cute romantic comedy. Kind of gave me the same feeling as when I watched ""The Wedding Planner"". Matthew McConaughey played the EXACT same character he played in The Wedding Planner, all over again. So, if you've seen The Wedding Planner, you know what you're going to get from Matthew. Kate Hudson's character is a sweet yet sophisticated (and at some points annoying, like when she was trying to get Matthew's character to dump her) young woman. She did as much with the role as she possibly could, given the simplicity of the plot and script. I'm waiting for Kate Hudson to take on more challenging roles as I believe she has the ability to become an amazing actress."
4,Kept Me Laughing,"Kate Hudson and Mathew McConahey were a match made for comedy. The chemistry between them made the movie. You'll laugh hard and not cry at all. I would've given it a 5, however, the ending is predictable -- just the way we like our love stories to be."
2,Predictible w/ a few good jokes,"I saw How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days(which, by the way, is a stupid title) on DVD and found myself laughing once in a while, which is strange for a romantic comedy. I could see the ""twist!"" at the end of the movie about 40 minutes before it took place and I thought about half and hour could have been shaved off. Don't spend money on this one, it's forgettable."
2,"How to, indeed.","Look Kate Hudson was born to be star. Matthew McHonaughey born to be a stud. This movie is uneven and really odd at times, but the card game scene is enchanting and at times so are both of the leads.There are some laughs and some nice moments like I said, but all in all just formulaic romantic-comedy fare. Good, but grows thin.The extras are nice, one of my favorites is the alternate opening sequence, which because there is a formula to these things gave too much depth to the character of Andie (Hudson). Unfortunate, indeed.But really this is a cute movie and will be great background."
3,Archetypal chick flick,"Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson in a story about love, lies, and more love. This is a chick flick, and it shows. Some fluff about people doing stuff that you know pretty much guarantees they'll be together at the end. Whatever.If you want to lose your guy in 10 *minutes*, make him watch this. Better idea--invite your girlfriends over, make some popcorn, and chat about how cute Matt is and how Kate Hudson looks in her yellow dress. (She is admirable if for no other reason than she hasn't bought herself obscene turbo-breasts. I gave the movie an extra star in admiration of her ethics.)Rated PG-13 for ""some sex-related material"". (What, in a romantic comedy? Who'd'a thunk it?)"
5,A cute movie,I Like this movie very much. I like the stars and I like romantic movies and wish more of them were produced.
1,awful,"i saw this on tv the other night and had to switch channels halfway. worst film ever, i dont care if this did'nt help you, this film p!ssed me off so much that i had to write a hateful review. how is it meant to be entertaining"
1,negative,"an ex of mine made me watch this with her. then i broke up with her immediately after.i want to know how to lose this atrocity from my brain in 10 seconds.kate hudson is cute, but not that cute to watch this."
3,So-so,"The movie was okay. I didn't get to see it in theatres and was glad to not have spend the money to see it. The character played by Kate Hudson was supposed to lose this guy in ten days for an article she was to write about. The character played by Matthew McConauhey was supposed to make her fall in love with him. However, both were short-changing themselves and it showed from the beginning they met. I'm not going to say it was the worst movie to watch but it wasn't all that it was hyped up to be either. The only thing worth watching were the fashions worn in New York City."
4,Predictable...,"This movie is predictable but fun and it has its laughs. Most movies today are predictable - but the ones that are predictable and AREN'T funny or not acted well make you want to puke. This movie is acted well, written well, funny but predictable. I would definetly reccomend this to anyone. Buy it. Play it. Enjoy it!"
1,Great actors.. bad script.. terribly boring/,Expected a lot from this movie due to the actors...was a long winding script that fell flat when it was to be comic.
4,I love me some Matty!!!!!,"HOWEVER,In MY world, there's no way that I'd meet a guy and end up spending every single day of the next two weeks with him. No freakin' way! That did bother me about this movie. And I'll be doggoned if he meets my family within those same ten days.This movie was pure fluff. Very predictable from start to finish. I hated how everything ended so nice and neatly at the end. Also, I hate how when women decide to leave and do what they want with their lives, a 5-minute speech from a guy just changes their mind. That crap makes me sick. The same thing happened on Deliver Us From Eva (I LOATHE THIS MOVIE) and several others that we all have seen.I wish I knew how to change the stars, because my true rating is 2."
1,HOW TO WASTE MONEY IN TWO HOURS,"OK THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF THIS MOVIE DID NOT GET FROM THE BEGINNING. WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE END BEFORE WATCHING IT PLEASE DO NOT ADMIT IT. IM NOT A HUGE KATE HUDSON FAN, SHE IS KIND OF ANNOYING AND OVERHYPED IF ASK ME. MATTHEW M. I LIKE HIM ,BUT THIS WAS NOT THE PART FOR HIM. ITS MORE FOR A SISSY LIKE ROMANTIC COMEDY KING HUGH GRANT. I WOULD NOT WASTE MY TIME ON IT. OTHER TITLES I CAME UP WITH ARE ""HOW TO KILL A GUY IN 2 HOURS"" OR ""HOW TO RENDER A HUMAN UNCONSIOUS IN TWO HOURS."" STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA, THIS WILL TAKE CARE OF IT"
2,DUD - Sinker Here!,Seen it in the theatre - what a dud. They have no chemistry and it's predictable. Save your money.
1,Just barely sat through it ...,"Oh great ... another run of the mill romantic comedy. I think Kate Hudson is an extremely talented actress (I thought she was OUTSTANDING in 'Almost Famous'), but I just couldn't take her in a movie where she's intentionally being annoying for an hour and a half.I kept thinking to myself ""I've dated people like this."" ""I've dated them and dumped them for these VERY REASONS."" ""So why am I watching this? These character flaws are every bit as irritating now as they were then.""It just didn't do anything for me, if you need a date movie, there are a ton of other good movies out now to choose from instead."
1,Retching!,Infantile plot concept with even worse acting. Ninety minutes of my time wasted. Why did I even watch the ending?
2,How to Bore An Audience in 10 Days,Then is the most uneven movie that I have ever seen. The plot starts out with both individuals having an agenda for meeting each other. One who wants a client account and the other wanted to have journalistic freedom to write the kind of stories she always wanted to. There was no chemistry between Matthew and Kate. Despite the fact the movie keeps pushing it. The story was so unlikely that by the end of the movie I didn't care about what happen to either character. Get the Wedding Planner instead.
2,"eh, it was okay, but I've seen better.","This movie, It was kind of funny because the jokes were there, and some women (notice I'm saying some not ALL) would do what Kate Hudson did, and I feel sorry for the charactor ofMatthew M. who had to put up with it. Like I said before It had some okay jokes, but it was way to predictable, and I think hollywood could have done better. A whole lot better."
1,A loss,"Even if you've never seen a movie in your life, everything about How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days will seem familiar"
1,corny comedy,Too ridiculous to watch. A waste of time. It wasn't even very funny. Its one of those shows that make you want to leave the theater before the end of the movie.
3,VERY FUNNY ROMANCE DVD!!,"This movie was very funny but it had it's gaggy some what corny parts. I would recommend that you rent this movie before purchasing. Meaning that this is a one time viewing romance movie, not something that you would want to watch a lot of times like Jerry Maguire or The Wedding Planner."
2,How to lose a guy in 10 days,It didn't work on a DVD. It just worked on my computer.I bought 4 other movies and they were all fine.
4,pleased in dvd: How to loose a guy in ten days,"I really liked this video, however there were scratches that effected the playability of the dvd."
5,LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! FUNNY!!!!!,"I loved this movie. It's one of my favorites. It's incredibly funny and romantic. This is one of those movies you'll watch over and over, again. It's a great movie to watch when you need a little pick me up. There wasn't one thing I didn't like about it. Great acting, great story."
3,Cute formula romantic situation,"She (Kate Hudson) is writing articles in a glamour magazine. She is tiring to get autonomy in her work. To do this she will right an article on ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days""He (Matthew McConaughey) is an advertising agent. To obtain an exclusive with the Diamond industry he has to prove he can make any woman fall in love with him within (you guessed it the same ten days)Due to circumstances and a little mischief from advertising rivals, the two are thrown together. What results is known; how they get there is the fun part of the movie.There is nothing exceptional about this movie. Yet it is well done with the correct formula timing and actors.The Skeleton Key ~ Kate Hudson"
2,"Woman loses, again, gives up all for love","Suppose, just for the sake of argument, you took this movie seriously. The woman loses the bet, quits her job, and gains an arrogant slob. The ending is what bothered me the most. She is off to the potential job of her dreams in Washington, D.C. He tells her she can write anywhere. True, but can she sell her writing anywhere? One can also work in advertising anywhere. Once again, it's the woman who gives up her hopes, plans, dreams, and goals to satisfy the colossal ego of the MAN. What could be more important than sacrificing yourself for a man?"
5,Great date movie,"This is a wildly entertaining film with likeable and charming characters. Of course, this is not an intellectual journey to the theatres-intead, it is a delightful romantic comedy that is enjoyable to those with romance in their hearts and love in their minds.Kate Hudson is charismatic and charming (like my wife). My wife and I love this film.Good movie."
1,HOW TO SCARE AN AUDIENCE AWAY IN 5 MINUTES,HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS (Paramount) should be retitled: How To Scare an Audience Away in Five Minutes. Somehow Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey survived this painfully unfunny fable about a couple with opposing hidden agendas. Life is short enough. Don't waste it on bad movies.
1,Mindless tripe,Unadulterated (but these days typical) Hollywood schlock. That's about the best thing I can say about it.
5,"""My boyfriend thinks I'm fat...""","How to Lose a Guyn in 10 Days is a sweet, harmless romantic comedy. The film stars the adorable Kate Hudson and the hunky Matthew McCounghey. Their chemistry is evident and right-on when their charcters first meet. Andie (Hudson) works at a women's magazine called Composure. Her assignment is get a guy to dump her in ten days all the while she is unaware that her new-beau has made a bet at his workplace that he can make any woman fall in love with him within ten days as well. This film looks stupid but it is defintely not. Rent it, buy it just watch this cute chick-flick as soon as possible."
3,OK,This is a charming little film. The lead actors are well compensated for this picture and they are beguiling all the way through. It's a cute film with cute and witty lines.Fairly predictable storyline though and back up characters are rather weak.
4,Great fun,"This truly is a romantic comedy, one that everyone could enjoy. The characters interact well together, which makes for a seemless story to unfold, one that is plausible and real. Buy or rent it, either way just watch it. Not just a good romantic comedy, but a good movie all around."
3,Another Chick flick,"An ok chick flick, but not my favorite. Has an interesting plot but not one that strikes a real chord. Some of the gutter language is required for the plot resolution, but it made me uncomfortable. Definitely not the greatest actors in spite of being big names in Hollywood."
1,How to Lose an Audience in ten Minutes !!!! :(,THIS MOVIE'S PREMISE IS SOO SHALLOW AND STUPID JUST LIKE THE 2 SELF ABSORBED MAIN CHARACTERS IN THIS PATHETIC FILM...SHAME ON YOU HOLLYWOOD FOR GLORIFYING PLAYERS WHO MANIPULATE PEOPLE'S FEELINGS FOR FUN !!! KATE HUDSON AINT EVEN ALL THAT AND A BAG OF CHIPS...SHE'S GOT A NICE BOOTY THOUGH...THATS IT !!! LOL
1,Commander X = RIPOFF. Find it ALL for free instead,"I've read the reviews of all his books, and going by the reviewers that give his books 5 stars (and the blind-sheep reviewers that agree), here's some free money-saving info:In your search for ""intelligence"", try being intelligent enough to download a p2p file sharing program, and exercise your brain to come up with some keywords for your downloads. If that's too beyond your reach, just stay with the relative comfort of the Web, and use Google - and be sure to use that brain for your search phrase! LOL. Seriously people, everything in Commansder X's skimpy books can be had, along with much, much more for free on the Internet - yes, that not only includes the Web (which is only part of the Internet, contrary to what the 5-star reviewers have yet discovered), but ALL users of the Internet that happen to use p2p programs - which, by the way, are free too: LimeWire, BearShare, etc. etc. etc."
2,Just a little whacky,"Just a little to hard too believe.This book did served it's purpose to entertain me. This is the firt Commander X book I've read, why the Commander X name, just use your real name please. No proof in what this guy is saying, there's always something when it comes to getting real proof. This guy might be nuts and I like books on U.F.O's, or this guy is on the level, not likely but maybe."
1,A laugh riot,"this book is absolute trash, but it is a very funny read. But if you try to take a seriously, you will put it down after a few pages, then go out in your back yard, start a roaring fire and then toss it in. And the name commander X is very corny. What is he commanding? the wallets of paranormal believers?"
4,Good Quality But Not Sharp,"Good look and feel to sword(not cheap at all),it's just not sharp.Highly recommended as a show piece or form sword as long as it's not going to be used for actual cutting.Also for the price-it's a steal."
3,Grit meets Hollywood,"Quick side note - my copy DID have subtitles, so not sure why someseem to not...A sweet, interesting mix of gritty, hand-held street style film-making,with a much more Hollywood story - a melodrama about girl singing grouptrying to make it, and get out of the ghettoUltimately a little thin on the character and emotional level for me,although I'll take it over a Hollywood bio-pic any day. But cliché'sare cliché's, even if they're handled with more energy and panache thanusual. You can see a lot of twists and conflicts coming a mile off.Also, some of the acting is pretty stiff - it feels like weakimprovisation. Per several articles on the film, the women were pickedfor singing ability (which is very high, great voices!) first, andacting second.Most of the songs are terrific, a few are a little lame.Bottom line, while not a great film,if you're interested in the subject, it's worth seeing."
1,No subtitles...no point watching,"This movie is entirely in spanish with no subtitles or dubbing. If you don't speak spanish VERY FLUENTLY, you might as well not waste your time. Free or not, it is a HUGE waste of my time trying to watch this movie. This was a Bonehead ""special"" offer."
3,Use with discretion,"I got this book because I have the utmost respect for Mustaine and anyone who's ever played with Megadeth, and if my band ever covers them, I want to NAIL the solos note-perfect. That being said, I believe the solos are transcribed quite well. The riffs, however, are a little dodgy. So far, I've gone through Peace Sells, which has pretty decipherable riffs and chords to begin with, but I've noticed a few errors that are pretty obvious. I would suggest use this book as a guideline, but not verbatim. Also, the book leaves out the fact that these songs are tuned down about 1/4 step from A440."
5,You'll be thrashing all night long!,"These are very catchy songs that are fun to play. If you are good at playing guitar, then be sure to get this. All the songs are awesome and sound just like the recording. I play these songs often and it helps me develope playing techniques."
3,An interesting twist of horror.,"Though not as good as the original, this film keeps you interested throughout.As is true in most cases the sequels are not quite as good as the original. The special effects in this second sequel to Watchers is average. I recommend this movie for rainy days."
3,"Good, but I bet they're better live.","I just gave victims family a first listen after months of being pummeled by the alternative tentacles e-mails saying how great they are. I get the same feeling as when I first heard Nomeansno. This isn't music for sitting around thinking or reading or whatever. This is aggressive moment-oriented punk. Not to be analyzed or quoted a la DK's or the Clash, but to be experienced, like a Nomeansno/Mr.Bungle skronkfest with some style and wit thrown in for good measure."
5,Practical advice for concerned parents,"Internet Family Fun is the kind of book I like to store close to my computer, because my older kids can use it when I'm busy in the other room. The reviews are easy to understand, but not shallow. Plus there's a good variety of sites. Lots of educational (but fun at the same time!)places to visit, which makes it great for parents like me who homeschool.The artwork is bright and clever. This book will please all ages, and would make a great gift for birthdays, holidays, or whatever."
5,kids songs,although i am 16 i am still obsessed with kids song and i know i may be crazy but i am and this album is great because it has all the basic kids song on it and it is great for a feel good album so im recomending it to all those people who like kids songs or all those people who have kids and are aranging a party. A birthday party maybe? all i can say is its great!!!BUY IT!!!!
4,Good song for 3 and 5 years old.,We like the songs on this cd....they are familar songs for children who can not read yet. My daughters are 3 and 5 and they liked singing along with the cd.
4,Very cute!,The kids love to sing along with these basic songs perferct for 2.5 and 4.5 years old children. Very cute to watch and hear them sing..
1,Disappointed,This would had been great if the vocals was included. I don't know some of these songs. So my 6 yr was disappointed when he didn't know the song and could really keep up with the lyrics.
4,Great Little Karaoke Set,I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter. She just loves it! All her favorite songs at one time!
5,Karaoke : Kids Songs,"This is a Great Selection, of Kids Songs, that, We All learned,in School,and, it'salso, a Great Way, to include, the kids, in Your Karaoke Parties, etc.."
2,No Vocals,"The CD does not play with any vocals, it is difficult for kids to follow along without the singing. It was hard for me to follow along."
5,Cloth Dolls by Brenda Brightmore,"I have yet to make a doll using this book, BUT I can hardly wait for Christmas to settle down so I can. I read through the entire book and what an inspiration! Instructions are so clear, beautiful pictures and now I understand how sculpted faces are made...I think I can do this. I have been looking for a book like this for years. Worth every penney."
1,who needs it?,why pay for a doll book that is for patterns only? Skip it unless that is your intent!
4,"A dark, depressing view of life on the edge in SF","Plate paints a grim account of what life is like in the dark corners of one of America's most beautiful cities - San Francisco. It's hard to find a likable character anywhere between the covers. The cops are cruel. Almost everyone else is crazy or drug crazed or maybe a combination of both. The plot is involved with flash backs to early times revealing the cruelty and danger that marked frontier life.The style of writing is clipped, crisp and sharp - I loved it. The author trusts the reader to ""get it"" and forges ahead with energy and a wonderful style that makes the reader feel like an insider. I might have given 5 stars if the book had been a bit longer!I'm sure the chamber of commerce in SF would not list this as one of their must-read travel books but lovers of good writing will want to grab a copy and spend a couple of hours reading about the darker side of a great city.Strongly recommended."
3,horror film,wanted this movie because of knowing the people involved and the work they did in filming....good job for all in the movie
4,Quick ship - Perfect Condition,"What a hoot! This is such a funny movie - and with no ""drags."" Ben Kinsley is perfect in the roll of hit man. Not a great movie (certainly not a Ghandi - but it wasn't meant to be!), but worth watching for a lot of laughs. Luke Wilson is one of the most under-rated actors in the business. He was perfect - absolutely believable for his role!"
4,WONDERFUL MIX OF COMEDY AND DRAMA!,"'You Kill Me' is one of those films that comes around every so often. You will run through a gambit of emotions watching this great little independent film. Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni are exceptional in their roles, but even small roles by actors (Bill Pullman & Luke Wilson)that usually don't impress me are really good in this quirky, smart and funny movie. It's short, sweet and it has the right amount of comedy and drama for my taste. This is a very good film that should be seen by all movie lovers."
3,"JOHN DAHL, OPUS 8","*** 2007. Directed by John Dahl. Frank is the hitman of the Polish mob of Buffalo. He's an alcoholic and is therefore sent by his family to San Francisco in order to overcome his problem. Some fifteeen years ago, the three first movies directed by John DahlKill Me Again,Red Rock WestandThe Last Seductionwere quite rightly praised to the skies by the critics and the movie buffs. They will now be disappointed by this tongue in cheek comedy that, though far from being unforgettable, made me nonetheless pass an agreeable moment. No more, no less. A DVD zone rental only."
2,This movie will kill you with it's boring script.....,"Somehow we are supposed to like all the disfunctional human beings in this picture. I can not honestly say which is worse. The lackluster script or the weak performances of Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. There is no one to like here, and you will get sick of it very quickly. Avoid this DVD."
3,"The film wounds me, but no kill shot.","A drunken Polish hit man from Buffalo exiled to San Francisco finds love working as a mortician's assistance and going to AA meetings. Sound quirky? It is. This satirical look at AA and contemporary relationships features great acting from Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni and good pacing from director John Dahl. Unfortunately the plot is a little thin and some of the supporting characters (Dennis Farina, Philip Baker Hall) are a little too over-the-top while others are a little too under the top (Luke Wilson), so the bulk of the film falls to the two stars, who individually are excellent, but who have no chemistry at all. Absent chemistry, their ""romance"" seems contrived, and I think the most they manage to conjure up is a kiss on the forehead.This film does have its moments, especially during the AA meetings."
3,Good Tongue in Cheek Horror Flick,"I was pleasently suprised by this classically gothic little horror film. Like all films that Roger Corman has either produced or directed this one is a little overplayed; but there is an element of style throughout. The Corman standards are here: naked, big-busted, serving wenches, the damsel in distress, the young hero, and some genuinely disturbing horror scenes. The sets are atmospheric and the writers of the movie have expanded on Edger Allen Poe's tragic perspective that filtered through most of his poetic works like Annabel Lee and the Raven. Not to be taken too seriously but nicely done. Nicole Eggert is perfectly cast as Lenora as has never been more beautiful. David McCallum does a splended job as her ""haunted"" father. All in all a good effort on a small budget."
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made,"I rented this movie for 99 cents, and I think I was ripped off even at that price.The acting was terrible, the plot predictable and boring. The only thing that I enjoyed was this nightgown that the lead character wore, and even then it was out of place, seeming more like it was there for the ""skin"" and to make the character more sexy than for plot development. Edgar Allan Poe was claimed as the person who wrote the story, and he is probably rolling over in his grave, this movie is so horrible! Everything is out of place and/or ridiculous. The lead character hops into bed as soon as she falls in love, which was NOT done at that time. Nudity was frequently done to ""save"" the movie, but if this movie were to do that every time this movie needed a boost the characters would be nude the entire way through.Needless to say, this movie stank. If it's not worth paying 99 cents to rent it, it's not worth buying, unless you like to rag on bad movies, which it is perfect for."
5,prophet jones,Only purchased this item for $0.01. Practically brand new!! Great buy Loved this gropu in High School. Where are they now though?
4,Interesting...,I did not enjoy this Cd as much as I thought I would. It is good but not exactly my style
5,"A nasty, raw....and stylish album 4 the soulfreaks..","These 4 guys really know how to sing...P. Rowe's voice kinda reminds my of Ruff Ends, and they've got this smooth harmony....(kinda reminds my of Jodeci & Dru Hill)All the tracks on this Album are [great]! My favorite songs are: ""Lifetime"" (of course), ""Woof""(for all y'all gangstas) and ""You can't""Especially the last song's a beautifull ballad...just listen to those lyrics man...P.Rowe's really expressing himself...much respect for that...no doubt!!But also the song ""Cry together"" proves that these guys are strong vocalists..P-J keep on doin' yo thang...cuz even here in Holland people are feeling y'all..Stay up playaz..Leroy.."
3,Lyrics of love,"Prophet Jones came out in Summer 2001. They brought to us the single ""Lifetime"". I fell in love with this song. It makes you wanna make a commitment to the love of your life, settle down, and have some kids. The video could have been better. It was so ghetto to have on a Black suit, White t-shirt, and White tennis. Come on guys no wedding is like this foreal. I also like ""Cry Together"" a remake of the O Jays from a classical to a modern version. The rest of the songs could have been better. Maybe next time yall should hook up with R. Kelly or Silk's manager..."
4,Blueprint Classic? Close But No Cigar,"The Blueprint is a dope album. The Takeover should be listened to by every aspiring MC to learn how to break down an opponent the right way (as well as for the rediculous Doors sample beat), Girls, Girls, Girls is classic material, Renagade is two of the best MCs to ever do it goin back and forth rediculous like. Everything in betwwen is real nice production wise but it has its questionable lyrical moments but they're not so bad they take away from this solid album. My only problem is Hola Hovito which is annoying unless you love salsa and Jigga that N***a which is pure filler."
2,Same old rubbish....nothin' new,"Over hyped, over produced and more of the same from the consistently average Jay-Z. Jay-Z to give credit where credit is due is probably the king of the one-liner. But if you have heard one of his self indulgent, self obsessed, egotistical rantings over a well produced but boringly over-produced beats. The track featuring you know who is probably the main feature of the album but if you don't get a migrane afterwards from the annoyingly unnecessary bleeping then you are immune to migranes and will never have one as long as you live. In Renegade the multi platinum, multi millionaires address the haters. If you're that rich and that successful why care? Don't get me wrong this album is okay but if you want something more challenging and quite simply remotely interesting, you're looking in the wrong place."
3,Half the album is good,"Well, I'm not a Jay-Z Fan, but since I listened him on the 2nd Clue album, I kinda waited for his next solo album, and I even bought ""Roc La Familia"" which is OK.And so he drops ""The Blueprint"", and the result is disapointing. I like it 'till the track 7, the rest is kinda wack, even that song with Eminem.Well I never thought Jay was the best rapper now, like many of people think, I respect their opinion, but one more time I got the feeling that he's too commercial, sometimes his beats r so annoying, and his lyrics aren't great and of course I was expecting more heat between him and some of QB finest.He still claims to be the King of NYC, in fact no one deserves the crown, I'm just waiting ""Stillmatic"" form Nas, maybe he can sit in the throne and stays there, 'cause I definitelly ain't feeling Jay...There are better rappers outta there, no doubt.But anyway, If u like him, probably U gonna enjoy this album..."
1,"Expecting everything, getting nothing","With a typical Jay-Z CD, you can putt it in and let it play without skipping a single song. With the Blue Print I found myself skipping every other song. After an extremely corny single of H to the Izzo, I found myself listening to a bunch of extremely corny songs with retro beats. Jay-Z appears to have gone soft on this one. The only decent songs seemed to be the takeover, Hola'Hovito, Girls,Girls,Girls, and Renagade. Jay-Z normally sounds hot next to a weak rapper like Memphis Bleek, but on the song renagade you really hear just how average he really is. Overall 4 good songs out of 13 is completely unacceptable for Jay-Z. I don't advise anyone to buy this record. Sorry Sean, better luck next time."
2,not a hater,"Now i'm gonna give this cd 2 stars, but dont look at me like some of the other cats who gave it 1. If u look at their review its just BS. Most of them are Nas lovers(i dont know y), or rap haters. I am NOT that!I wouldcopp a cd if i gave it 3 stars, but 2 means i can't listen to it. In the Blueprint's case, the beats suck.He gets 2 stars for being the best rapper, but production does matter."
1,A Terse Comment,"I never bother with music like this but I just heard (and really listened to) 'Girls, Girls, Girls' for the first time and I feel the need to say something. Harold Cruse comes to mind, ""If Blacks do not completely re-organize culturally, politically and economically, they will not survive regardless of what changes America undergoes. That quote says it all. The reviews below fascinate me. Black people's minds have been constructed to think this is who they really are.P.S. This is the most sexist, misogynistic song ever made. This cd is an affront to any sensient Black person."
5,The #1 album,This cd is the best. You don't get any better than this. Jay-z is awsome on this cd. Plus the lower price makes it worth it.
4,Good Pickup,"This is a tremendous album with great vocals and beats behind Jay-Z. The song ""Takeover,"" which highlights Jay-Z's climb in the music industry is a great song. While it's heavy, the album has other songs like ""Heart of the City"" and ""Song Cry"" which contain beautiful chorus verses supporting Jay-Z. A necessary complement to this album is definitely his MTV unplugged album."
2,Not all that,"I have to say when i bought Jay-z's album 'hard knock life' it was hot. I hadn't heard nothing like it in a long time so i looked forward to 'Blue Print'. I hated it straight away. It was the same old thing. Jay-z talking about how hard life was in the Ghetto and how he's living it up now and how much women he's got. Lets face it he's not the best looking thing and women only like him because he's got money.The beats are the same. You can't feel the music like hard knock life. The man can't rap to save his life and he's toooo boastfulH.O.V.A, and Renegade is about as good as it gets and Neva Change. Take my advice, Ja Rule is where it's at. Get his album, Jaz-y's finished"
3,A good album but NOT classic .,"It's important to note why Many people think that this is jay-z's best album since his first because of the samples used throughout the album, the music isn't original and the beats and samples kill me, jay's lyrics seems rushed, ""jigga that N888"" ""all I need"" ""hola hovito"" all filler tracks with poppy hooks and are used for Cd space, On the positive side, the blueprint enjoys good production and it's difnitly one of jay-z's best albums.Production: beats 8/10 .........lyrics 6/10Favorite tracks: U dont know, renegade."
3,jayz,i mustr say reasonable doubt is not really a classic to be honestly speaking i think it wasnt a bad album i honestly wat i could say he had sum pretty okey samples and beats it was an okey album so im rating it an ok as in not that bad compared to blueprint 2 which was extreemely comercial is ay blueprint 1 was betterThe Blueprint [Explicit]
5,This is kanye at his best beats and jay with his best ryhmes,okay so listen to this album and tell me one bad track they are all classic. I love the beats...kanye is so good and just blaze on song cry....even timbo is good....well this is a great album but reasonable doubt has better lyrics.
3,The Blueprint Of Jay-Z,"Jay-Z returns with his 6th album ""The Blueprint"" and this time he has the ""Soul"" in him. All i have to say about this album is that ""H to the Izzo"", ""Renegade"" with Eminem,and ""Jigga that Nigga"" are the only 3 good songs on this 13 track set. Jay is gonna be 31 years old in December, but has already made his mark as a great rapper. SOme like his change to soul, but to me it's not the same, much as Rap these days."
5,A Blueprint that leads to a great album,"This is a great rap album,every song in this album is good especially Renegade(with Eminem),Blueprint,IZZO,Heart of the city,and Takeover(dissing Nas).I'm a huge jigga fan,all his albums are good like Volume 2-Hard Knock Life and Volume 3-Life and Times of Shawn Carter.Buy it you won't regret it."
5,Yea..,If yall enjoyed this album as much as I did then you will most likely find the album No Mercy No fear by 50 Cent and Whoo Kid. It's off the chain.
5,Definitely worth the money,Jay-Z's best album. Period. Reasonable Doubt is a classic no doubt but the beats plus an even hotter from Jigga on Blueprint make this his best album by far in my opinion. Believe that!Jay please come back to rap. These other rappers cant' be serious. I mean really.
4,Definately ONE of Jay Z's best,"At first, I was hesitant to buy this CD, because the only Jay Z Cds that I already had were Hard Knock Life Vol. 2 and Roc La Familia: The Dynasty and both of those CDs weren't that great in my opinion. Well I decided to get this CD and I'm glad I did. My favorite songs are Izzo (H.O.V.A), and Renegade (I like Renegade because of Jay Z, not because of Eminem's part all though Eminem isnt bad in that song. So those are my two favorite songs, but there are also many more good songs on this CD. This is one CD a true rap fan should buy. Get it Now!"
5,The Best damn Cd jay-z ever wrote alone without r.kelly,"omg! where do i even begin, jay-z has made rap/hip-hop what it is today. i mean even tho he teamed up with R. Kelly who did commit a crime just recently but i m not going to get into that but what i m saying jay-z is the best rapper of his time. he has seen a lot of things & lived a lot of things. on a recently tv ashow on VH1 caled MOJO40 he was rated like 17 in the top 40 to have the best mojo ( and what a mojo is having everything in the business world is wat we call grapefruits or what i call it.) & jay-z has his own clothes line out called ROCAWEAR & also has one of the best damn record companys in this era called ROC_A_FELLA he is the best even tho NAS disses him i like jay-z' music & that is why i m giving his album ""BLUEPRINT"" fivestars aight yo ~ 1 much luv"
5,Best Album Of The Year,With some of the best lyrics and beats this album is the best of the year. Ever since Jay Z drop his first classic Reasonable Doubt he wasnt the same. But after the Blue print came out he easily returned to the top of the rap world. Every song on the cd is great. And the song Takeover is the most real diss I ever heard. Its seems the only people that hate the album r Nas fans who cant admit Nas hasnt released a good album since Illmatic. And with a weak come back with his Ether song didnt help. If you dont believe me believed the Source who rated the Blue Print a 5 Mike CLASSIC
1,Complete and utter trash...,What happened to 'Reasonable Doubt' or 'In My Lifetime Volume 1'? Those were dope albums. This release is Jay's worst and proves that not only has he sold out to a more pop style it proves he's fallen off alot as well. And he has the nerve to diss Nas for fallen off? I don't think he should be talking.
