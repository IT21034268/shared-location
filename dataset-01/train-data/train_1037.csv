1,High hopes fall to subpar product.,"This saw is built for the occasional user. Upon opening the saw, concealed damage had occured at some point to the saw arm. A piece of metal had broken off and was laying in the box. Amazon made it easy to return the item for full credit. I purchased the saw because it had some features that I did not have with my previous saw, nameley the laser guide. Even with the lights out, I could barely see the laser line. If you are going to purchase this saw, lower your expectations and you may like this product."
5,Outstanding for upper elementary kids!!,I teach fifth grade and use this book when we study weather and catastrophes. The children can't wait until we read the next chapter. It is one that they have trouble putting down. It shows not only what a devasting effect a flood can have on people's lives but the strength it takes to rebuild and help others. Excellent for teaching character traits such as: responsibility and courage.
5,piston rings,im vary happy with my piston rings for my honda worked vary well on my engin rebuild thank you vary much
4,I love nirvana,"I love nirvana and the fact that i could get this hoodie online is great , amazingly comfortable and stylish and great Nirvana fan wear its an all around great hoody anyone looking to buy something that screams "" I love NIRVANA"" this is definitely one of those items."
4,HVLP for the Home User,"I do work on quitars as a hobby. I've looked for a way to spray lacquer without the blushing and other problems that come with compressed air sprayers (oil, dirt etc). Even a decent dryer system for a comressed air setup was about the same price as this system. With this I get warm clean air and after figuring out how to adjust the gun to my liking, the finish is a professional as any I've seen! I don't think I would consider it a ""production"" system. Especially if you are trying to lay down thick coats to save time. I had to thin my lacquer considerably and lay down very thin coats to get it right. (But then I'm using water based lacquer)..."
2,Interference Problems,I am on my fourth set of wireless headphones (having gone back and forth between radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IF) designs). In general the RF perform better (especially the newer digital models) and I genuinely liked the RCA's UNTIL a neighbor purchased a 900 mhz base station for his cordless phone system. The resulting interference rendered the RCA's useless (it turns out that current cordless phone designs send out transmissions even when the phone is not in active use). Keep this eventuality in mind if you live close to other people -- what works today won't necessarily work tomorrow...
5,WOW,"I just got these headphones for my birthday, and they are great!!! I can go more than 150 feet like they say, even more! Also the headphones are really comfertable and are very compactable.Also, the docking staition is ver convientent and small, click plug in. Its better than the other ones!! Buy IT!"
1,Terrible RCA product,Cheaply made and range is awful. They cut out anywhere from 3 feet on. Try another brand and you will be much more satisfied.
2,Static anywhere,I have static near or far from it! and it will not work from too far. Top 15ftfor the price its ok but next time I;ll get a good stuff
2,oooOWWWW!,"These headphones hurt my ears. They press on the cartiledge in your ears.I gave these headphones away to a coworker. He used them once and gave them away again! The range is about 100 ft, but vs 2.4Ghz headphones, these breakup with static anytime they feel like it! So the range should be 5ft without breakup. I guarantee if you give these to someone you will find them in a closet one month later!"
1,Severe shortcomings,"Don't plan to use these headphones near computer equipment. A horrible cordless-phone hiss is your constant companion. And get ready to do the ancient tribal dance of the perfect-location-relative-to-the-tranmitter. Worse, the manufacturers must know of this shortcoming-- if you don't pump sound into the headphones, they'll shut off to help you preserve your sanity. When the next sound comes through, the headphones will turn back on again-- after the sound-- accompanied by a half-second burst of static. If you're trying to make your computer desk wireless, these are not for you."
2,Disappointing...,"I received these as a Christmas gift. At first, they felt okay, but after a very short time, they started to really hurt my ears. They are not as padded as they appear. They don't adjust down quite small enough to fit well (maybe my head is just too small!). I got quite a bit of static and interference just turning my head-forget actually walking around! Had to constantly readjust the frequency. Overall, I found them to be more trouble than they are worth. I was disappointed and am returning them."
1,Avoid these like the plague!,"These headphone absolutely kill my ears after about thirty minutes of use! I got these to wear at night so I could watch TV and not wake up my girlfriend, I can't wear these more than 30 minutes before my ears start hurting, try watching a whole movie and you will be rubbing your ears for at least an hour afterwards trying to recover. The product besides comfort is just fine, sound quality, range, everything else works just fine (not great), but the comfort level of these headphones is by far the worst I have ever seen."
2,"Ok, but not great","On my never ending quest for the perfect complilation album, this one rates about a 3. It had some really good songs - like ""Dancing In The Moonlight"" - King Harvest and ""I'd Really Love To See You Tonight"" - England Dan/John Ford Coley but overall the other songs were just ok. Unless you really want these songs, I'd look for another 70's album with some more classics and less obscure songs."
3,"Good graphics and interactive play, terrible computer logic","The graphics, layout, user friendliness of setting up a board is great, but 1 on 1 with the computer is not very challenging at all. The computer makes very dumb mistakes even on Agressive mode and I find myself trapping or sacrificing my own players just to make it challenging.The interactive version is fun (you can play with people on zone.msn.com) and more challenging (obviously depending on your opponent). Not many people play at the MSN game zone, though and the chat capability is quite poor."
2,hasbro is a cop-out,"when i originally bought this game for my windows 98 it worked great! but, now that i upgraded to windows xp the game won't play anymore. i go to hasbro.com and they tell you that you have to go to infogrames, but, when i try to get a hold of infogrames i get a dead end! so if you have windows xp for your computer don't waste your money on any hasbro(or is that has-been) games. the games don't work and hasbro is no help."
4,I am addicted!,"Anyone familiar with the old ""Stratego"" board game will be familiar with this one, as it's the exact same game. I enjoy playing the computer, although I almost always win. Still, it's a challenge, and a fun one, to track down the enemy's flag. I wish they had a difficuly setting, as I could really use a tougher opponent, but I still say it's a fun game and well-worth playing if you've got an hour to kill."
3,Alright,"I love the board game and this PC version is just...alright. Nothing spectacular or too great, and the graphics/sound are way outdated. Buy if you like the board game or for your kids. Slightly recommended."
5,Perfect for street work vans!,"I charge my 8 battery chargers inside my work van and this is how I get 120v to my chargers. I have seen and used other products, but of them all, I like this the best and will buy it again. Looks good from the curb. Very sharp clean, small tidy product. I have used other residential exterior outlets and looked at marine outlets for a higher price. This product is perfect for the low budget DIY'er."
4,125 Volt Charger Connector,"Makes charging easy hook up, you must splice tie in or make your on pig tail, well made with one exception, the lock retention washer on the back is to small, I liked it enough to order another one."
5,Outlet for power frustration,"Have you ever needed 110V inside an enclosed utility trailer? The extension cords strung across the ground and on the floor of the trailer are a trip hazard and just a mess. This through the wall plug-in allowed me to connect a power strip so I can connect several devices without the cords all over the floor. I also get the benefit of having the breaker of the power strip to protect my electrical devices. This plug was easy to install and looks great both outside of the trailer and inside. Using a heavy duty extension cord is a lot easier to power a radio or other electrical device, simply plug it in. I was so pleased with this device I plan to purchase several more for another enclosed trailer."
5,Great product,"I used this on my 2012 ram 2500 to have a new mounting locationfor the block heater plug,Works great!!"
5,Well made componet,Used on my F250 to plug in my block heater. Componet is well made and work as described. I would recommen this to others.
4,More uses,I bought this item for use on an 8x12 building I constructed. Electric is available to the building by extension cord only from a nearby power source. I didn't want to run the extension cord through the windows or doors because the building is air conditioned. The charger inlet is installed through the back wall of the building and permanently wired to 2 grounded outlets. Being able to connect up in this manner is extrememly convenient.
3,Hymnworks Christmas with Linda McKechnie,"This CD combines classical music with timeless Christmas favourites which is a nice alternative. The arrangements are ok but perhaps not at seamless as I like, but in sayingf that it's worth buying at the price."
4,Music selection as eclectic as show!,"When you deal with TV soundtracks, you stay pretty much in a music genre similar to the show's structure. And then you fill it in with drivel the musical artists didn't want on their own albums for one reason or another. This is a welcome exception. To my knowledge, any song Drew used on his show is on this CD. He fills the rest in with musical soundbytes from the cast, and the result is an incredibly eclectic playlist that runs from Tower of Power to Iggy Pop to Peaches and Herb. If you are familiar with the show, you have been cursed with viewing the image of Drew and his friends stripping in your mind any time you hear Edgar Winter's ""Free Ride"". But that's small price to pay. Give it a try."
3,carrey makes few good choices for soundtrack,"While I am a huge fan of the show, I must admit I had to stuggle to give the soundtrack 3 stars. The reason being that I was never a fan of the opening song that he did for season 1 (and 2?), ""Moon Over Parma"", which is cheesey and quite frankly makes absolutely nada sense. That plus I just plain do not like most of the songs on the c.d. The only thing that saves it is the medley ""Groove Thing&Time Warp"", ""Cleveland Rocks"" and the song he sadly only used for one season, ""Five O'Clock World"", which is very catchy and addictive. I still think that for just those 3 songs the c.d. is worth buying."
5,This Soundtrack Rocks!,"What a find! I stumbled across this CD in a used bin. A great, diverse mix of songs from a show with a musical pulse. This CD doesn't rely on trend or cliche - just good music, good humor and, as Iggy said, a lust for life. Buy it without remorse whatever the price - this is money well spent."
4,If you identify with Drew's life.Here's the background music,"I bought this CD because I like the show, but I found it striking a chord and bringing back good memories with the good music. The soundtrack clips are tough to hear clearly at 55 mph, but the music is mixed at grade A quality."
3,Something a little different...much like the show!,"The Drew Carey Show is one of the few on TV that has fun with music. Using music in a variety of ways, as theme songs, parts of skits, or full blown musical numbers, the show has been inventive with a variety of styles of music. From Peaches and Herb (Shake Your Groove Thing) to Iggy Pop (Lust for Life) a number of genres are sampled here. You even get the chance to compare The Presidents of the United States' cover of Cleveland Rocks vs. Ian Hunter's original. (My opinion: Drew should have stuck with Ian) Maybe a bit too eclectic for some, (Do we really need ""A Man and A Woman"" on this?)this cd is still a lot of fun and worth a spin for fans of the show."
5,A keepsake packed with fine color photos,"In 1996 over nine million Britains tuned in to watch the new Dr. Who science fiction TV show. Doctor Who: Regeneration charts the show's history and its newly revamped appearance, providing insights into television politics and the challenges involved in returning Dr. Who to new audiences. Prior fans of the series will consider this a keepsake packed with fine color photos."
3,"It is a KIT, not assembled.","I thought this was an assembled model...IT WAS NOT..Not a deal biggie, but just another kit I have to make."
2,Difficult and Dull,"This book is particularly dissapointing if you have read Ishiguro's Remains of the Day, which was such a lovely, perfect understated novel. This novel does employ some similarities of style and Ishiguro's prose is crisp and lyrical. But the book is confusing and unclear. The fewer than 200 pages drag on without drama or motion. At the novel's end the reader can't even feel that he or she has been offered any particular insight into the main character's mind or motivation. Too much is left unsaid or unexplained for the book to be effective. If this book were a person, I'd want to shake it by the shoulders and demand an explanation."
2,ishiguro at his best? what a disappointment,"i'm quite amazed at the many good reviews this book has received. Finishing this book is like having a nice discussion with a friend who, at the end of the hour, tells you he's dosed your tea with LSD. Is he serious? Why would he possibly do such a thing? This writing is nicely crafted and subtle, the narrative shifts easily between London and flashbacks to postwar Nagasaki, and beautifully skates along the rim of cultural chasm. But the `surprise twist ending' is silly, amateurish; like mixing coca cola and Bordeaux, the climactic melange of genre falls on its face. For a beautiful cross cultural novel that carries itself through from beginning to end, skip ""pale view' and go straight to `the samarai's garden'."
2,Eh?,"Well. It's a little slip of a book, really. And nothing happens in it. Rather, it does happen, but it isn't stated. Everything important that does happen isn't mentioned or even hinted at, and you're left to form your own picture. All that happens is a bit of dialogue between people. For the most part, the people seem wooden and unrealistic, though as the book goes on this misgiving remains only concerning Sachiko. Her condescending mannerisms start out irritating and only get more so.It's hard to give this book a particularly good score seeing as all of it is locked away beneath the surface. We should all be given huge critical acclaim for writing our own ""A Pale View of the Hills"" to explain the bits Ishiguro sees fit to provide us. You might like this exercise in minimalism, or you might not, but I personally do not find it awe-inspiring."
5,Memories of a sinister nature,"On a rainy afternoon in England, Etsuko recalls a distant and brief friendship of many summers ago. As the reader begins to travel down the road of memories, they are transported to a world and life long ago. As a housewife in post World War II Japan, Etsuko leads a content and stabile life. Until she meets Suchiko and her enigmatic daughter. As their friendship progresses, readers become wrapped up in a cocoon of mysteries and unanswered question.The memories take on an almost dreamlike quality and the reader is present with bits of the puzzle slowly but steadily. The end is a surprise and does leave room for speculation, which some readers may not like. However, this is truly a memorable book and one of the best debut novels I have ever read."
5,Seminal work!,"This novel is classic-Ishiguro; subtle yet powerful in its depiction of loss and sadness across time.In the end Etsuko becomes Sachiko, and Keiko becomes Mariko. The reader is startled by fate's cruelty and mischief."
3,Beautiful writing but doesn't hold together,"I enjoyed this short book from the first page. The writing is clear and beautiful, evoking sophisticated pictures and places. I was disappointed with the ending, though, in that I felt it did not quite hold together, and I was left with too much ambiguity."
4,Good but,This is a good novel. I like Ishiguro's novels but after reading The Remains of the Day - which was so good - let me rephrase that - so excellent that this novel left me deflated. He really reaised my expectations in his writings with Remains of the Day and now they are back down on Earth. This novel is good but if you haven't read Remains then I would try it first. The Unconsoled - is better too - if you can finish it and see the underlying current in the novel.
2,An aimless orbit in 'Ishiguro Space'...,"So I thought I had a few pages missing from my book, or something; that's how unfinished the story was/is to me. Didn't get it, not even remotely. We are introduced to a bunch of characters, none particularly random, yet all still disconnected from one another. Readable enough, but to what end? And I thought 'Artist' felt hollow; this book is the defination of boring. And anti-climatic to boot. I am rather confused; isn't this the same Ishiguro who gave us 'The Remains of the Day'?"
3,Just about okay..,Book is devoid of any photos.Neelam Batra offers a variety of recipes.The book is okay.
3,Mildly interesting but tedious,"You can see how his writing style improved, his voice became clearer as he aged. Yet it's tedious. Over and over you read about gin, whiskey, the weather, birds, his terrible relationship with his nutty wife, his inability to get perspective on life or writing in these journals. He is not as straightforward or revelatory as we would wish.It's mildly interesting but don't expect to learn a thing about writing or even his writing."
4,Musical mayhem,"The first-ever Dexter's Laboratory CD has some songs from the hit TV series such as ""Lab-retto"" and ""Just an Old-fashioned Lab Song."" Also there's something I like to call an ""Audio Adventure"" entitled ""The Musical Time Machine."" I know you can hear it all, you just have to imagine seeing it like on TV; that's why it's called an ""Audio Adventure."" So you see, the show is good on TV, but is more fun if it's like radio !"
4,Almost perfect,"ARRR. So they decided to have the SHOOBITY DOO BE DOO song for Professor Hawk, but not the song that follows in the same episode 30 seconds later! It's not as funny, but I still miss it. I can't think of anything else that I would want on this CD. And of course Labretto is AMAZING :D"
4,Very good book about child rearing,"Everything that Dr. Peters says in this book appears to be common sense, yet I know very few people that actually act like this. She lays down a very simple framework about what our children should and shouldn't do, and it is an extremely helpful guide.The format is very straightforward. The beginning of each chapter spells out what the law is. She adds a ""real life""story about inappropriate behavior, and she follows up with how you can truly get good behavior again.As a busy mother, I found the book easy to get through, and not too clinical.The only thing I didn't like was some parts of her chapter on bullying. Some of her ways to stop the child from being bullied seemed to be a bit off target. Otherwise, this is a great book on parenting."
3,Little detail yet full of common sense,"This book is somewhat disappointing to me. It is well organized, concise, to the point, and useful as a book to keep parents on the right track.However, I found it to be lacking in real details about certain issues with kids. It also is not a real gripping read; I found myself skimming the chapter more than obsorbing what they really said. It would have been more helpful to me if it had greater detail and methods for dealing with kid issues like discipline and the middle school ages.I recommend books by John Rosemond that give me a little more substance than this book."
3,This is the best they could do???,"oh boy. what a let down. these are the best songs that the labels could have picked? granted blind, lit up, roadhouse blues and bulls on parade will definately rock, but why pick old tunes from some of these artists? i alone, everything zen, santa monica, if it makes you happy and so pure are either just ok songs or songs we have heard being played every five minutes on the radio. how 'bout a new live song or something new like down from sheryl crow? if i was alanis i'd be pretty upset. sure this cd will probably be worth buying, but speaking as someone who missed the famed woodstock, this cd is just not gonna cut it with me..."
3,"Not Good, Not Bad","Well, I bought this CD on an impulse, after just scanning and seeing that it had good bands... and well, it only has a few rocking songs. It would have been much better if there was more than one song per artist... Another koRn, Alanis, or Live song could have EASILY replaced the one-hit wonders like Godsmack, Kid rock, and Jamiroquai... who the hell is Jamiroquai anyways? and what was the deal with that stupid 'interlude'? Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of good songs like ""I Alone"" ""everything Zen"" and ""Santa Monica"", but somehow I feel cheated cuz I know that for a double-CD album of a GREAT concert I should listen to all 33 songs 24/7, not just 12 every now and then."
3,could have been better,"I liked this cd alot but there was some setbacks like on some tracks you can barely hear the singer , a good example of this would be Korn's ""Blind"" I heard about two lines. The song itself is good though. Other than that this cd is awesome."
1,All the best songs were left off........ WHY ?,"First of all let me start of by saying Woodstcok was great. The media blew up what happened on Sunday night, when all it was, was us blowing off steam at the hole production of it. Now onto the CD, it is half way decent but there is no and I mean no emotion in it at all..So many songs were left off that DEFINATELY should have been on there. For example Sheryl Crow's version of ""Sweet Chlid of Mine"".....Mickey Harts -Fire on the Mountain, Collective Souls version of an OZZY song, Kid Rocks cover of a John Fougerty tune, and they could have picked a much better song from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, like half way through their set when they just JAMMED. Plus countless more. Whoever put this together should be fired. As a vetran of both Woodstock 94' & 99' I am very dissapointed in this CD, I hope whoever is listening will take my advice and put out the real WOODSTOCK 99' Album, it will do alot better than what you have here. Enough said ! -Mike-"
3,Woodstock 99,This is a pretty good cd. I would have liked more songs like the orginal in a 4 cd set with 2-3 songs for every band. The better bands like Green Day and Beastie Boys should have replaced one-hit wonders. Some songs are great but the entire concert should have been covered alot better with more songs and all the bands. Then it would truely be a great CD. Also some bands played other songs that were better than others that were put on the CD.
3,"I enjoyed the red CD very much, but the blue CD?","I'm glad that they're releasing the blue CD and the red CD seperate. I got the 2CD set for xmas and here's my review:#1: I know for a fact that Green Day was there. So where were they on the CD? That dumb interlude shoulda been a Green Day track. #2: WHERE WERE THE BEASTIE BOYS? They had LIT there! Now, I have nothing against Lit, but they haven't even been out for a year! Beastie Boys? 14 years almost! And where were they? #3: BLUE ALBUM SUCKS. The only good track on this one was Everclear.Again: they're releasing 'em seperate. Get whichever one you'd like."
3,I was there-and some of these songs barely showed up,"sheryl crow doesn't even deserve to be on the cd. her performance was a low of woodstock, even more of a horror than the fires. i wish they would have focused more on the acts that rocked woodstock.(offspring, sevendust, limp bizkut, kid rock). it would be cool if they came out with cd's covering their whole set. This cd doesn't to it for me, i didn't even see half of those acts."
2,This cd was pretty weak.,"whoever compiled this cd should go straight to hell! whathappend to all the other good songs by the other bands? take a look alimp bizkit, could they please put another song on there? there issomthing that kinda sounds like microphone feedback sqeaking in the back round. i have the ppv on tape and there were much better songs than ""show me what u got?"", what happened to ""break stuff""? That would be cool if they put that one on there. another thing, i threw away the 2nd cd cuz it totally s***ed. they could've put some better songs on here. this is a shame that they put these s***y songs on here...very dissapointed, waist of $24. ill just buy a cd burner and make my own woodstock cd from the pay per view."
2,The essence Of woodstock 99 is not fully portrayed at all,"I feel the cds lack the real story told by the three nights of passionate fans, who endured SO much just to be a part of the moment in which the fans and music became one driving force. The CD's do not depict the emotion felt by the crowd since a good portion of the bands are not even featured on them (so why did they even perform???). The video could have been split up into several tapes to show the three days in which peace led to inevitable violence on the last nights. It could have been SO much more worth the purchase. This should have at least been a 4 cd set like the original woodstock, however, like the concert, I feel as though I were robbed yet again."
3,Well...,"Now, don't get me wrong on this, Woodstock was an awesome concert, and this cd has some great tracks on it. But the songs on this 2 cd set has no more than 1 song per artist, and some artists featured at Woodstock aren't even on it, (Fatboy Slim anyone?), and considering most artists did at LEAST 10 songs, well, think about it! It's hardly a snippet of what Woodstock was. I'll be happy with my tape of the ENTIRE three days from the Pay-Per-View showing, thanx."
3,"Woodstock '99: Make war, not love!","I went to this show, and the chaos and fires you always hear about happened at the very end of three days. Most of it was fine, just really hot. I think everybody can agree that the idea of ""Woodstock"" failed in 1999, but based simply on the bands performing it was amazing. Never seen so many huge groups in my life, including Lollapalooza. The first disc (red) is mostly the heavy bands, the second disc (blue) the mellower stuff. Unlike some others I'll take the red disc any day, but that's just because most of the disc 2 bands don't do much for me. There could have easily been a third disc of missing bands. Where's Collective Soul, Tragically Hip and Ice Cube? Anyway it's a great collection of bands, some still going strong, and some who peaked in 1999. Besides the music, my fondest memories will be the $4 bottles of water, overflowing outhouses, and seeing people have sex in the wide-open, as I walk by and take a photo."
5,Hiyasmin,"I bought WoodStock 99 for my husband who broke his because he played it so much. He tried buying it at the local stores but no one carried it so I bought it on-line which I recommend, since most stores will not go out of their way to get it for you once they sell out. Brand spanking new two cds with thirty-three songs between the two. The cover jacket is loaded with pages of pictures of the various bands and artists playing on the cds. The sound is very clear almost like you're at the concert yourself and with the audience cheering and singing along makes the artists and the songs sound phenomenal!"
1,"""album version""? No.","When a track is tagged ""album version"", it's supposed to mean it is the version from the ORIGINAL ALBUM, not a live version, not a remix, etc.e.g., it's not supposed to refer to the album the song is currently sold on. OBVIOUSLY the tracks on this album are the versions on THIS album."
1,Boring books,"I confess, I knew nothing about this and found it very difficult to read and understand. Looks like something an English teacher might use to teach stuff about the Shakespeare type stuff."
4,"Top music, top DVD, Camerawork could improve","This was my first music DVD, and it really shows the power of the medium. Beethoven's 9th is a top, maybe the top musical piece in the world. When seeing the orchestra actually perform this, in only rises in greatness.To say one thing that can be improved: I found the camera perspective too narrow. Only closeups of Karajan and the then current lead instrument. On TV I saw another 9th of Beethoven, recorded in Leipzig, and here you also had full overviews of the Orchestra and Choir. I found that visually more pleasing than just these closeups."
2,Legitimate problems here compared to other DVDs,I have reviewed 5 Beethoven DVDs. Yes the recording is old....but can't imagine why video is so poor. The real problem is we buy these great masterpieces to experience the orchestra and not the conductor. We don't buy operas to watch the conductor nearly full time. I would agree there is little cinematography going on here....which seems criminal with such an important piece. I am nervous to get any Karajan piano or violin concertos les they not focus on the performer. I have a solution in Beethoven's masterpiece. Get the recent Blu-ray Vienna performance with Thielmann conducting in glorious 1080p DTS high definition. You will always judge every classical DVD by this performance....especially the direction and cinematography and of course picture and sound quality.
3,"Conservative performance, lacklustre video production","The sound is perhaps marginally better than its CD equivalent, however, the DVD really doesn't take total advantage of the medium. The views of the orchestra and conductor is very limiting. Infact there are at most 6 vantage points of PARTS of the orchestra, conductor or choir. One really never sees entire sections or for that matter the entire orchestra. The result is a feeling of ""claustrophobia"" and no sense of occasion.The tight shots are not sympathetic to the breadth and the grandeur of the music. The DVD medium could have allowed switchable overviews of the whole choir and orchestra.Furthermore, the views are backlit to the point that the glare is annoying.As far as the performance is concerned, it is highly polished, but somewhat on the dull side."
3,Interesting,"Finally I bought this Karajan's last Beethoven's symphony cycle on DVDs and it was really exciting to take a close look at the conductor and orchestra while they were playing. The orchestra and chorus are just excellent - exactly what I expected since I have their 1970s performance on CDs. However, I am still quite disappointed by the 4th movement of the 9th Symphony because of the girly voices of the tenor and baritone, although the soprano and alto are brilliant. Each time when I was watching this one, I had to be away from TV and speakers to avoid listening to tenor and baritone singing. Anyway, it's still worth buying since I cannot expect another DVD from Karajan. My rating for this symphony cycle is 5 stars for Symphonies nos. 1 - 6 & 8, 4 stars for the 7th and 3 stars for the 9th. The sound quality of this DVD is not as good as on CD but it's not a problem when turning the speakers louder."
2,This DVD is only for Karajan fan.,"If you're a serious Karajan fan, this DVD maybe for you. It's just another Karajan's conducting show. But if you're a regular classical listener/watcher, you'll be very disappointed as I am. You can see at most 15 to 20 players and singers on screen during the same time. But hey, this is Choral Symphony. There are 200+ people on stage. The sound quality is in distance from Karajan's 1963 cycle. I would suggest the DVD Kurt Masur conducting Gewandhaus Orchestra. This DVD is much better for your ears and eyes. And you'll get an idea why Choral is so splendid before you go to the concert."
2,Terrible camera work,"I did not have any problems with the sound although I have CDs with better sound tracks. But I was very disappointed with the video. The camera work was atrocious even by 1983 standards. No wonder I have never seen this broadcast on TV or cable.Neither the orchestra or the choir are shown in their entirety. There are only side shots, no direct shots. It appears that only two cameras were used and all that changed was the zoom of the cameras which was not very much.I am very sorry I purchased this DVD. I am better off with the CD."
1,Is it really live show?,"I doubt if it is really a live performance recording. It is quite impossible to have those angles taken if it is really a live performance... If it is the case, it won't be difficult to understand why we cannot see the whole orchestra and audience. It is totally unacceptable to buy a dvd without the chance to see the whole orchestra."
2,Good but not Great,You won't get the good sound effect on this DVD. Buy it if you care about seeing Karajan conducting. Don't if you expect multi angles and surround sound quality you may expect from movie DVDs. A CD will give you the same sound quality at a lower cost.
5,Stunning performance of the greatest musical work ever,"Many critics find the CD of this performance to be one of Karajan's worst, but I fail to fathom why. Perhaps having the visual as well as aural changes the perception. This is a stunning work. The choral arrangements are the strongest I have ever heard, not watered down like on Norrington's 9th. Being able to see the singers makes the perception that much better. I hope that in the future all classical music is recorded in this format. It could certainly help pick up the lagging sales in the market. It could also revolutionize pop recordings, as artists could release an audio album complete with accompanying videos. This is where the Sony/Philips SACD could really make an impact: artists could release a single disc which would allow CD play of the music in cars, on portable stereos, etc., and also allow audio and video in a home theater system. Let's hope the industry catches on!!!"
2,Is that it?,"Heavenly bureaucrats believe angel Giordono (Krzysztof Globisz) is hanging around unsavory types in Purgatory too much so they send him off to Earth to assist the struggling humans. Giordono arrives in Poland and takes immediate and great delight in earthly pleasures which humans take for granted. In Krakow he meets up with a comically crazy homeless guy (Jerzy Trela) who hooks him up with a single mother, Hanka (Ewa Kaim). A friendship ensues but Hanka suddenly passes away leaving Giordono to take care of her son.Polish comedy, Angel in Krakow (Aniol w Krakowie) (2002), is the directing debut of Artur Wiecek. This film has a few enjoyable moments but the main storyline is far too underdeveloped. As the closing credits roll viewers will ask, Is that it? The 2005 sequel, Angel in Love, is definitely a more entertaining and accomplished effort."
5,very nice goods,"before I used this item , my spray finish is very poor , butthis one is a very nice , and easy use ... I think I will useit in the future."
4,Best Hymn Collection,"This collection of Christian hymns is like none other I've ever purchased. The sacredness, beauty and majesty is superb. I am in my 50's and there were many songs from my youth which the modern churches don't sing anymore even though the message in music is moving and provides wonderful communion with God."
5,They are better than the Beatles!!!,"Of course I have listened to the oldies all the time, and my favorite band is the Monkees! They are everywhere! They were on the Simpsons, you know, the deal with the lunchbox. They sing all the cool songs like DayDream Believer, Valleri, Last Train to Clarkville. Forget about the Smashing Pumpkins, these people are better than they are. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,"This is missing ""Tapioca Tundra"" & ""D.W. Washburn""! What's up with that? What was Rhino thinking? Just save up a few more bucks and go for the 4-cd box set. That has everything and then some!"
5,'Fantastic' music!,"The Monkees Anthology CD set is a great collection. Although there is a boxset out there for around $60.00. This CD set is sound for sound the best investestment for little over $30.00 for 50 of they're best recordings! What impresses me the most about this collection is all four members of The Monkees gets a chance to do their own solo songs. While other singing groups just relies only on one member so sing the hits. The Monkees are backed by some of the greatest songwriters ever check out the talents of Tommy Boyce, Bobby Hart,Carole King, David Gates (of Bread), Neil Diamond. And the list goes on. So if your up to the challange try to keep up with Micky Dolenz in the song ""Going Down"". I can understand why nobody's made a remake of this one. I'm ""Going Down"" for the count after just the first two verses. A fun CD and the TV series is a genuine treat to watch also."
5,Monkees - 'Anthology' (Rhino) 2-CD,"Even though I've heard every one of this 2-CD release's fifty tracks like a zillion times before, if I'm in the correct frame of mind, I can still get plenty from this timeless made-for-televison bubble gum band's repertoire. Part of the fact might have to do with the fact is I haven't heard all THESE cuts in years. All your Monkees favorites are here, and then some. Tunes like the ""Monkees Theme Song"", ""Last Train To Clarksville"", ""Saturday's Child"" (one of my personal Monkees faves), ""Sweet Young Thing"", ""Mary Mary"", the single edits for ""Steppin' Stone"" and ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"" plus too many more to list here. An absolute must-have. Would make a great gift. Quick footnote: remember the song ""For Pete's Sake""? Some fans I've come across still don't recall that cut right off hand. It was the TV's show closing theme for the second season."
4,Secret Monkees Listening Technique Revealed!!!,"It's simple, really... just keep your finger on the ""Skip"" button, and as soon as you hear Davy Jones - PRESS IT!! (unless it's ""Daydream Believer"" or a Harry Nilsson song)"
5,very pretty,"These earrings are very pretty and perfect size. I really love them, and wear constantly."
3,"Nicely Made, but Small","These earrings are very well made, but they're only 11mm wide, not 1/2"" as stated in the description. That doesn't sound like much, but it would have made a difference. I wouldn't mind paying a couple more bucks for a bigger earring. I do like them, though."
4,Gotta Love Pat,"Pat's a Wisconsin boy who's been performing in clubs and bars across the upper midwest for years. Irreverant, funny, rude but always entertaining. If you're easily offended, don't buy, but if you can take a joke, and you are not (a) a religious fanatic or (b) a Republican fanatic (to the extent those two are different) you will enjoy this. Pokes fun at just about anyone that can be poked fun at."
3,"Not worth the price, at least in America","This is quite an interesiting and thourough book. Although I really don't understand the stupidity of it's price since I bought it for 60 Euro in Portugal... Really, You can get all the information in this book for much less than this absurd price...."
2,Kidnapping is not light reading~,"Having never read anything by Beverly Barton, I'm unlikely to pick up another one after reading ""Keeping Baby Secret."" The first half of the book deals with the kidnapping of the heroine's 2-month old child! This is NOT a subject matter for light reading, nor would any normal mother be able to ""get over"" this kind of trauma to fall in love with the baby's father in a few days! I liked Frank very much and appreciated that this couple was not young and dewey-eyed. Still ... kidnapping? And the shameless 'set-up' of two characters for (no doubt) another novel bothered me--it just came out of the blue! And PLEASE, when selecting a name for the heroine in your next book, pick something other than Lurleen (with a nickname of Leenie). I found this name, in itself, very distracting. Not a keeper for me..."
4,"Great game, few problems.","I think Recoil is a good game with lots of fun and thrilling action. It has superb graphics, even with its low system requirements. It could be sayed no better than ""Action gaming as it should be."" With a ton of weapons, enimies and enviroments, this Tank simulation is as good as it gets, besides one thing. The levels can get a bit long at times."
3,Good game but could be better,"Recoil has great graphics, excelent weapons, and moderate gameplay. Recoils graphics are realy good even in software rendard version, the levels are very detailed so are the tanks and robots. The enemies are ok and they actualy come at you with the same weapons as you use. The movie cutscenes are horibly lame so skip them. The weapons ,on the other hand, are immence and explosions are very good. Gameplay however is not that good the missions are to similar (you blow up all the enemies, smash into the weapons factory, generator, ect. and blow it up) pretty dull. You can save mid-mision but you cant go back and replay any of the missions. If you want A good first/third person shooter dont ignore recoil but its not the best either."
4,Good old fashion computer fun,"It was a game from back when I used to have Windows Millennium Edition. I used to play Shogo, Doom 95, Wolfenstein 3D and Need for Speed 3. I liked the dark atmosphere this game had, it really submerged me in this dystopian future to the likes of Twisted Metal.I hope the $164.98 price is a joke from Amazon, I'm surprised they also list it on the ""new"" section as low as $68.88. As good as the game is, it shouldn't be more expensive than your average casino or hunting PC games at Walmart."
2,Hard to use (which shouldn't be the case for this type of product!),"The product itself is fine, but for whatever reason, it was really difficult to pull one individual wipe out of the packet. It didn't seem like the outside edge of each wipe was centered so as to be able to easily access it through the opening in the middle of the packaging. That opening is fairly small, too, so it was hard to dig around in there to pull out one wipe. I wound up tearing the top wipe trying to separate it from the one underneath it. I wanted to get this to have a travel pack, but one that was more environmentally sound than individually wrapped wipes, but I wouldn't buy this particular product again."
3,Cottenelle Travel Pack,"I had intended to buy the individual packets because I have found that if you don't use this whole pack shortly after opening it, they tend to dry out. I'm not crazy about this particular product."
5,The height of heroic fantasy!,"`Divided Allegiance' is the second book in a trilogy that I considered one of the best sets of fiction books ever written. The story picks up where ""Sheepfarmer's Daughter"" left off; the majority of the book is taken up with Paksenarrion's life away from the mercenary group she trained with. Paks is a very likeable character, and it is easy to become emotionally attached to her. Starting in the previous book, we get to watch her mature from a simple recruit to a seasoned warrior. This book is just as well written as the first part of the trilogy, and the plot fulfills on its promise. Elizabeth Moon has created a work of fiction that is simply outstanding. Once you pick up this book, you will not be able to put it down."
2,What a crummy way to end a book!,"The first 3/4 of this book was perfectly acceptable... not great literature or anything, but quite entertaining and held my interest well. Then close to the end something happened, and the farther along I got, the angrier I got at how the book was going. I had a very hard time actually finishing this book because of the direction it seemed to be heading. It would be hard to describe what happened without giving away the plot, so I'll just say it made me so angry I was ready to throw it across the room. The level of incompetence and irresponsibility by certain characters depicted in the last few chapters was just staggering and really detracted from my enjoyment of this book in a major way. I can't see how it was necessary to write it this way. I read fiction for entertainment, not to be frustrated and upset... there are enough things to stress me out in every day life that I don't need something like this to make things worse."
4,A True Independent Movie,"This is one of those movies that most people have never heard of. If you give it a chance I think you will enjoy it. It was rejected by the Sundance Film Festival, but later that year won 2nd place at FilmFest New Haven in Yale beating out many of the Sundance films from that year(1999). DOGS IN QUICKSAND then went on to be an audience favorite at several other festivals throughout the country."
4,A Blackmetal Squad Union,their lyrics is about some ancient war (i think) and their music is pure Black metal.Hail ABSU!!!!!!
3,ABSU - Black/Thrash!,"Well, this CD Isn't bad at all, there's some pretty good tracks on here, but If you want some killer black/thrash, check out BLOOD STORM! Their aLOT better in my opinion. Get their CD entitled: Death By The STorm Wizard. The Guitarist/Vocalist Mezzadurus use to play live gigs with Absu! Overall, Absu's Sun OF Tiphareth doesn't totally dissapoint. Great US BM!"
2,Can't decide,"Just finished the book, and a bit on the fence with this one. A couple of times hateful things were written by family members, and I was wondering why you left the RV with a fridge full of food when there was a comment about how bad the fridge smelled when you purchased the RV. It had it's entertaining moments. (What the heck did you expect to find in Fort Stockton, Texas)"
2,A must read for all families traveling together,For all of us that have traveled near or far with our families in tow.. this is a great story as told by all members of one family. Every member of our family enjoyed reading this adventure. Great insight and lots of laughs.
5,I know what you did last Summer...,"The journey of a life-time as seen through the eyes of an entire family. Insightful, adventurous and laugh-out-loud... You find yourself cheering Julia to the finish and then searching Ebay for used RVs. Summer vacation at its best... the Good, the Bad, and the Funny!!"
2,Terrible and incomplete instructions,"I was so excited to start the green hat on the cover. Unfortunately, the instructions were vague at best and completely leaves out steps at the end, so you end up with a flabbergasting flat mush of felt when you are finished. Easily the *worst* pattern instructions I have ever worked with. What is worse is that they never show you a photo in the back of the hat, so you literally have no idea which end is up. I ended up having to search online for other people that managed to piece the thing together and look at those photos. I highly recommend looking up the photo instructions for the green hat from the ""Fashionable Forties Blog"" - without those instructions I would have burned the thing in frustration!"
3,Decently good read,"The overall story was well set and it certainly draws the reader into what would happen if a deadly virus really did infect our world. There have been may other stories like this and this one isn't too shabby, but it's not the best. Still, Book 2 is coming up soon and I'll be itching to get it! Keep it up Sharon :-)!"
1,Did I get a rebuilt Toro Irrigation Lawn Genie L50106P 6-station Sprinlker Timer?,"We made a choice of buying a NEW ""Toro Irrigation Lawn Genie L50106P-Station Mechanical Watering Sprinkler Timer"" versus a used one, shipped to us by Vanguard Wholesale. After careful installation, this device did not perform properly. As a result our lawn began to dry out.I made several attemps to call Vanguard Wholesale for possible resolution, but never got a call back for messages I left. My husband called a plumber who dicovered the system was defected. We shipped the item back to Vanguard Wholesale. It cost us an additional 3 hours labor to the plumber, a new timer system and shipping costs to recieve & return the item back to Vangaurd. Shame on Vanguard to charging shipping fees for a return which was beyond our control."
5,fun and no chemicals,"The point here is that by filling and dumping, there are no chemical or cleanliness or filter concerns, a good thought in this day and age. The way to dump is to buy a cheap sump pump off eBay, and not worry about the little plug."
3,Intex Inflatable Pool,"Two disappointments. It didn't have a drain plug to release the water. Guess I just assumed it would. Also, when we first inflated it, it already had 2 small holes in one of the air chambers. We repaired it with the enclosed repair kit. Hope it holds up because it is a lot of fun for the kids."
2,Doesn't Last!!!,"This is the second Intex 120X72 pool we've bought in the past year. Cheap price and the size is great allowing the entire family in the pool with room to spare. So much for the good parts. Last year's pool made it through the summer, but didn't last beyond off-season storage and one week inflated this season. Problem was a seam on the air chamber split open. Not repairable. So we bought another one figuring for fifty bucks, we'd get one summer out of it. Well, the second pool lasted 5 weeks before the top air chamber burst scaring the #$#@ out my son and me! Bottom line, these pools just don't stand up to continuous Florida sun and chlorine needed to keep the water clear. Also, the newer second pool didn't seem to be as sturdy and lost it's shape (sagged sideways even when filled with air) rather quickly. We're going to seek other options since the quality and durability of these large inflatables don't seem to be worth the headache."
2,No easy way to empty!!!,"I like the pool... it is big enough, appears to be sturdy enough, however, the one that was sent to me did NOT have a plug on the bottom. Therefore, to empty it required my wife and I to lift it, full of water, and dump the water out over the side. It is the end of the summer, so I have no desire to return it and then wait another two weeks to get another one. I like the pool, but it was definitely NOT what I ordered."
1,Florida Sun kills it,I got-this for my daughter and it just couldn't stand up to the sun here in florida I would imagine a summer time fun toy for kids would hold up to summer time sun.....guessed wrong in this case
1,Keep looking,The shoe is so wide my feet slide around in them in a very uncomfortable way. I wore them once and never again. Look elsewhere.
4,I love these shoes,"I think I am on my fifth pair. I put a lot of miles on them.I remove the insoles and replace them with custom orthotics.Plenty of room. Kick em on, kick em off !"
3,WORKS WELL WITH SJOBERG BENCH,"One free holdfast was included when I purchased the Sjoberg bench. Like the product review states, this is made especially for the bench. I can't see any reason for someone to get this if they don't have a Sjoberg bench.It does work suprisingly well. It fits pretty loosely in the hole, but by friction creates a strong clamp."
3,3.5 stars - a solid Christian rock album,"1985's Between Heaven `n Hell is another fine album from long-running Christian rock band Rez (otherwise known as Rez Band or Resurrection Band). The album, which features a nice use of dual lead vocals courtesy of husband and wife team Glenn and Wendi Kaiser, has plenty of that mid-80's AOR/pop/rock sound. It's catchy and melodic, and rocks pretty hard (not as hard as a Stryper album would, but somewhere on par with Petra). It's obviously a Christian rock album, but the band doesn't rub your face in their faith. You can still enjoy Between Heaven `n Hell as a good rock record.Between Heaven `n Hell is a worthy addition to any Christian rock fan's collection, though it might be a bit tame for those who enjoy heavier music. It should also appeal to fans of 80's AOR/pop/rock as well."
3,Picture is misleading,The picture of this item shows a stand and a guide fixed to the sander. I believe it would be proper to just show the stand or to explain that the guide is a different item and costs extra. The stand does what it is supposed to do.
3,A Bit on the Flimsy Side,"Does the job, but barely. Had trouble getting the stand to mount over the dust outlet, having to force it over far enough so that I could still use the dust collection bag. Using the sander on the mount without the bag is pretty unthinkable, as the exit for the dust would then blow right in your face! The plastic is thin, the mounting clamps (seen at the bottom in the product photo) are pretty flimsy considering the weight of the sander, its power, and the task one might very well expect to perform with this sander.However, it is the only available product for doing this task! Too bad - I would like to have more confidence that I will not accidentally break the stand while using it."
1,A Piece of Garbage...,"...which is what I just did...threw it in the garbage! I have never been so disappointed in Amazon...this pathetic junk is so bad in picture quality, sound, color, acting, dialog...Im angry that Amazon has the nerve to take money from people for this trash."
5,this book teaches some of the most important lessons in life,I haven't thought about this book in YEARS until I saw a story on CNN about a cat that had been abused and then rescued/loved. I remembered the story that I read many times in childhood as well as the movie based on the book. I would like to find a copy of the movie but have not been able to locate one(help Amazon!).I wholeheartedly agree with the previous comments that this book should be introduced to kids today. I know that I cried each time I read the story--but it teaches great lessons about from love to the pain of loss.I look forward to my new copy arriving!
5,i love this book,Love Great thanksthis was a great buy and recommend to any one. Great thanksthis was a great buy and recommend to any one.
2,Disappointed,"This DVD was poor quality, and you could not really enjoy the movie, good movie, just poor quality, plus I thought it would have more of Tim and Don in it."
1,These apples have worms,"Knotts, you are a disgrace to acting. This movie has the bite of a toothless lion. When the stuttering moron pulls down his pants and shouts ""WE-llll, my apppple isssss rotting!"", well, lets just say the apples on my tree all turned sour. END"
4,Blast from the Past,Saw this movie years ago. Loved it then and enjoyed seeing it again. A golden oldie. Don Knotts and Tim Conway make an amazing comedy team.
5,never fails to make us smile,This is my husband's favorite movie. It takes him back to a simpler time when he did not have to worry about the world. We both love it.
5,Hilarious!,I am so glad there are still some good clean movies out there.This one is real funny and you will enjoy it.
4,One of Disney's best,"One of the best live-action Disney movies. A sweet story about misplaced children, an unwilling but good-intentioned gambler as a foster parent and two bumbling crooks as the comic foil. Bill Bixby, of ""My Favorite Martian"" and ""The Hulk"" fame, plays Russell Donovan, the roaming gambler who is unwittingly stuck with some ""valuables."" Tim Conway and Don Knotts, a little past their prime, play the hapless crooks known as the ""Hash Knife Outfit."" Susan Clark plays the tomboy stage coach driver who fills in as the kids mother. Beautiful scenery, lots of action, comedy, and a fabulous saloon brawl that is the highlight of the film."
5,Great Fun For The Kid In You,I used to watch this movie as a child everytime it was on the wonderful world of disney back in the 70s and early 80s and it always cracked me up. I must say I think Don Knotts is an absolute genius and Tim Conway is also.The way their characters interact with each other is absolutely classic and is a tribute to the legacy of great Disney Slapstick.So what if the movie isn't what the so-called sophisticates call great art.It is still great fun for the kid in you. That is if you will aqllow it to be. I sure do!
3,They call them the Apple Dumpling Gang,"Once again Disney released a classic in it's fading days of ""G"" rated gems. The loose knit comedy team of Don Knotts and Tim Conway is always a hit in any situation. This is one is a bit plot heavy for them and Disney but it still makes you laugh. Bill Bixby is their straight man who carries most of the plot. At first they try to rob him but by the end they help him, his kids and his girlfriend defeat the bad guys and save the town. This is a very good movie and the sequel is even funnier."
3,A Gift,"I purchesed this as a gift for someone but since I've also seen the movie I'll throw in my two cents. The movie itself is still enjoyable, if you're from the era, and the special edition looks better than I've ever seen it. Having said that; however, I am not as content with the condition the case and disk was in. I was under the impression that I was buying this new, but failing to fully read about the product was my fault. Once I realized my mistake I looked into it and it said the product was in ""very good"" condition. The case was partially melted and the disk had smudges all over it! Is it too much to ask for five seconds with a cloth to wipe those off? I am rating this 3 stars (I rounded up) because the disk still plays ok, which is the important part, but otherwise buy new or save your money."
5,Cowboy,We got this movie because Papaw loves westerns and our six year old loves Papaw so they got to watch a movie that was good for both of them.
4,another childhood memory,"My siblings and I thought this movie was just hilarious when we were very young. I bought in the hopes that I could share it with my class at school. While it is still a hilarious movie, I would never show it at school. I am extrememly picky about what I show to other people's kids. The main thing I have a problem with is the drinking. It shows a ""saloon"" pretty often and you can see the glasses of beer and at least one character gets drunk. It's too bad, because it is a classic. I will keep it for personal use. It is a clever, funny film that all ages can enjoy."
5,movie,The Kids all loved it. They were laughing the whole time. Love amazon!!!!! Can't wait to watch the second one.
5,APPLE DUMPLING GANG,THIS WAS A VERY GOOD FILM. WE REALLY LIKE DON KNOTTS AND TIM CONWAY.WISH THERE WERE MORE GOOD CLEAN MOVIES TO WATCH.
3,The Late Don Knotts shines,"Knotts and Conway were right up there with the many slapstick duos you've seen all along. I rate this film high by the number of loud belly laughs from our kids.This movie is really just a collection of supporting actors handed an entertaining storyline. It is based on a book wherein the action happened in the California Gold Rush days. In this film you see a bad guy in a Confederate kepi hat and it is apparently postwar. The cooley laundrymen might seem a bit stereotypical for some.Rich detailed scenery and backdrops. Great outdoor filming. Some anachronistic costuming? Maybe. Dusty's ""wedding gown""(?) at the conclusion of the movie seems oddly out of place for the time the film occurred in.This one belongs in your collection with Million Dollar Duck, Snowball Express and so many other Disney/Dean Jones films"
5,Oh the nostalgia!,"This movie is a classic! It's wholesome and fun and everything a Disney film should be (not the garbage they're making today).I watched it with my kids and while they were laughing away, I was enjoying the moments of nostalgia from my childhood.This is the kind of movie the entire family can watch and no one will be bored."
5,The Apple Dumpling Gang,"This is one of the funniest movies ever made. This is a movie that you will watch over and over again. If you want to enjoy an evening at home with lots of laughts, this is the one."
5,Great family movie,I agree with the review written by cordell jeffries. This is a movie for the entire family with no worries about what will be said or what you will view on screen. I am enjoying introducing my 8-year-old daughter to all the movies I watched when I was younger and the movies her 25-year-old brother watched over and over as a child. I only wish those making movies today would take note and realize that not everyone wants to hear vulgar words and view explicit scenes in movies or even on television for that matter. I would highly recommend this movie for families and anyone looking for some innocent laughs. Tim Conway and the late Don Knotts provide plenty.
5,A rare find at Amazon.com,"I first met Steve Green at the National Church Music Conference many years ago in Knoxville, Tennessee, at Johnson Bible College. His music has been a blessing to me through the years. A few months back a friend told me that he had located a song entitled ""Rest"" that he had been looking for. He had found it on a Steve Green CD. I listened to his recording and decided I had to have the CD for myself. The CD is worth the money just for ""Rest."" The other ten songs are a delightful added bonus.Joy to the World"
4,Solaray,"I have been using l-lysine for years to help control fever blisters on my lips and it has been very effective. I usually get the oval shaped caplets, but decided to try the capsules. The capsules are larger than the caplets I usually get, but easier to swallow than the tablets. Seems to work as well as other brands"
5,HELP WITH COLD SORES AND HERPES BREAK OUT .,"THESE ARE GEL CAPS (EASIER TO SWALLOW)..AS SOON AS YOU FEEL THE TINGLE OF A COLD SORE OR HERPES BREAK OUT TAKE 6 OR 7 OF THESE COUPLE TIMES A DAY. I'VE BEEN USING THEM (AS WELL AS HSB, SISTER AND OTHERS) AND IT SOOOO SHORTENS THE TIME YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM. THEY ARE CHEAPER IN CAPLET FORM BUT THE CAPSULES ARE EASIER TO SWALLOW WHEN YOU NEED TO TAKE SO MANY."
4,The best book on Corydoras,"Although quite old, this book is the best one I have found on cory catfish. It's an invaluable reference for a catfish lover."
4,C & I Foxx Review,"Charlie and Inez Foxx Mockingbird makes a great addition to any music collection. The product arrived from the seller in excellent condition on a timely fashion. Some selections were not included on this particular Cd that would have been nice to enjoy listening to. Suggestions to where other Charlie and Inez Foxx cd's can be obtained would be helpful. The seller was no nonsense, gave no excuses, and did what they said would do. This seller comes with a good recommendation."
5,Gabrielle has RISEN,"I fell in love with this album the very first time that I heard it.Gabrielle's vocals on this album are searingly beautiful and the songs themselves are brilliant.From the first single ""Rise"" to the hauntingly beautiful ""Tell Me What You Dream"" and the uplifting ""Sunshine""; each track takes you on a journey - the types of songs that you play when you're alone and the candles are burning...love songs with passion and meaning.This is one of the best albums I've bought. I've had it for months and it's still in my CD player."
4,New singer for me,Was not familiar with her work. a great talent! I will surely purchase more of her mp3's in the future
4,This is the best game you might ever BUY!!!,"This could be the best game you could buy! The style changes maybe gone, but you get the cool soul styles! You should get thestrategy guide here while your at it. In this game, you get to fight like protoman! And if your wondering if you have to playup to three times to get the goods, you do. You really should get the game here. If your playing it right now, to beat the final boss, hit him when his core turns red or your in for a tough fight. I strongly suggest buying the game and strategy guide here more than anywhere else! have fun!"
4,"Best of the best , 5 Stars all the way!","Its comin out in a couple days and i am gettin it the day it comes out!Its so awsome, from what i heard and reasearched the graphic are way better, the chips are way cooler,the enemies really stand out, overall if you are a huge fan like me, get this game, if you just want to get it over with and beat it get red sun, but like me, get Blue moon if you want to collect all the chips and stuff... so really my title says it all..."
4,Fake my foot!,"(...) The box is only for what they use to display games that haven't come out yet.If you look closely and enlarge the picture, it says so.Duuuuhhh! Anyways this game is fine! And remember ALWAYS read fine print unlike the guy who says this game is fake!"
1,The worst in the series.,"This game is the worst game in the Mega Man Battle Network. The reasons why?1. It has very bad cel-shaded graphics.2. Translated from Japanese very poorly.3. Absolutly very little story-wise. All the game is, is fighting in 3 tournaments, and fighting a big boss. All the game really is, is a bunch of little missions that you have to do, like finding a foot-bomb.4. Capcom makes you play through the game 3 times to get all of the souls.If you really want a good Battle Network game, then get 1,2, or 3."
4,#4 is 4 times better than the rest!,"The megaman battle network games have been the best games I have ever owned! Each one has new friends, new enemies, and new surprises! This one has a program called the soul unison program. It allows you to transform into a beaten enemy, at a cost. If anyone is looking for a RPG or any game for that matter should definitely buy this game."
4,This Game Deserves a better rating,"I can't believe you gave this such a low raTING GUYS,i MEAN COMMON,this game enables you too fight viruses and hackers,customize your navi to how you like it use a new soul unision system,new battle chips and everythin,the other games in this series had Higher ratings and they don't even compare to this game,It is by far the best game in this series and made by Capcom,the offical makers of this game,I think Everyone shold re-think their ratings."
4,THE HOLY GRAIL FOR MEGA FANS!,"Ok, so that's not entirely true. But this game does rock hard. Over the past few months I've gathered more info on this game than... something *_*. The graphics take a small step up. Instead of every road being a continuous square, traveling in the cyberworld is more enjoyable. Functions in the real world have greatly improved. Check out the trains ^_^. The soul unison and the dark soul make gameplay more risky, and dark chips kick. At current exchange rate, and complete game play, but this if you are a fan. If you are new, play some of the older games first to get the full experiance."
5,ANOTHER GREAT GAME FOR MEGAMAN!!!!!!!!,"NOW ANOTHER SERIES FOR MEGAMAN GAMES AND IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER. THIS GAME HAS GREAT GRAPHICS, GAMEPLAY, AND ITS TWICE THE FUN THAN THE OTHER SERIES OF MEGAMAN. INSTEAD OF STYLE CHANGE NOW THERE IS SOUL UNISON!!! THIS ALLOWS U TO CHANGE TO MANY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS. ALSO THE DARK CHIPS ARE GREAT AND REALLY REALLY POWERFUL, BUT THE BAD PART IS THAT U LOSE 1 LIFE AND U CANNOT GAIN IT BACK. ITS LIKE A GAME GUIDE IS ALREADY IN THE GAME BECAUSE MEGAMAN HEPS U IN SITUATION."
4,M.E.G.A.M.A.N a.k.a Blue bomber is back!!!!,"Wat up! The Megaman Battle Network Series is hot ain't it. So if you played those there is a very good reason to cop the other new one. Cuz i know i'm goin' to cop it cause i am a big fan of megaman. So yall kid at home cop the the new one Megaman blue moon or red sun cause i know gonna get so SIT DOWN CUZ I""M GET IT FIRST! YEAH!"
4,oh great.....,from everything ive read about this new game and the smalller bit ive played this is not a good game if your sick of battle network3.if your never played it or liked bn3 and lost it get this one. overall game comparison its just another small upgrade in the battle network line.
5,Natural and useful,"We enjoy Aveeno products ourselves so we were happy to see that they have a baby line. This bath set is the best; it includes all the stuff you need and none of what you don't need. The products are all-natural, safe, and doctor-recommended. My two-week old baby has already enjoyed all of the products. And it's nice knowing that they're safe on baby's sensitive skin and have no fragrance. A great ""alternative"" bath set to give as a baby gift."
4,Two thumbs up,This headset is a great product for the price. The range of the wireless receiver is great and I have used this at work to talk with people all around the world via skype. It also can operate as a headphone to listen to audio from any application. Overall this is a solid headset.
4,Could be better,"A lot of folks do not do their research. I knew this would not work on my XBOX 360. I only use this for my PC and laptop when I am on the road a lot myself. It is perfect if you have multiple things to take care of, especially when in a meeting and trying to Cook at the same time haha. but still this is a nicely recommended piece for those road warriors out there."
2,Cheap headset but you get what you pay for.,"For being in the $30 range for a wireless headset you can't complain. But when I got this on and started talking to people through Skype complaints started arrising about the audio quality. The earpiece sounds nice, you can easily hear everyone. But the mic that is in this headset is awful. My family kept telling me that they could not understand what I was saying or that it sounded like ""i was trying to talk with a trash can on my head."" If your wanting a ""cheap"" wireless headset, get it. If you want something with the quality so that people can understand what your saying, keep looking."
2,Microsoft Lifechat ZX-6000 (No wires but poor quality),"I purchased this product with the goal of recording the audio from my lectures as part of a Camtasia file. Before purchasing this product I used a traditional desktop mic to record audio. I wanted the Microsoft Lifechat so that I could have the flexibility to walk around the classroom without causing variation in the sound and audio quality.The Lifechat does what it says it does. I was able to record audio at a consistent quality throughout the large lecture hall. However, the quality was pretty poor and I needed to spend a bit of time enhancing the audio in Camtasia to make it playback OK.The biggest problem, however, is that the wireless mic caused my audio and video files recorded in Camtasia to be out of sync. I recently read that this is a typical problem with wireless recording devices.I had to discontinue use of the product."
1,bought the wrong item,I thought I was buying my son a wireless headset for xbox. I bought the wrong item and was told they would not except returns unless something was defective with merchandise. So I am stuck with this.
3,DOES NOT WORK WITH XBOX 360,"I expected this to be working with my xbox 360...b/c it looks the same with the 360 wireless headset.The problem(for 360ers) is that it doesn't have sync button to use with controller.wondered why this, even with the receiver, could be cheaper than the wireless headset for 360...the bundled receiver works for wireless 360 controllers on computer though.just wanted to warn you guys not to make the same mistake that I made.I'm struggling installing the driver on my computer.Amazon should make this product not show up at xbox 360 section."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I needed a new headset to use with Ventrillo, online voice chat for gaming, and I needed two requirements: 1. must go through the USB port because my mic port is broken, and 2. must be wireless because I constantly trip over the wire on my Logitech headset when making quick trips from the computer to the kitchen... which is why my Logitech headset broke in the first place.This Microsoft headset fits both requirements, so I bought it. Unfortunately, the sound quality is HORRIBLE. It sounds like you are talking over the phone, like someone calling in to a radio show. It is NOT crystal-clear sound at all. My guild mates on Ventrillo laughed at me so much that I put this headset aside and slapped my Logitech headset together with masking tape."
5,Lifechat,Microsoft LifeChat ZX-6000 Wireless Headset- This product works well and I am very pleased with it.
4,I dig it,"Please note: I don't use it for gaming.That being said, it does exactly what I need it to do. Provide clear communication via video conferencing when experiencing mild to moderate ambient noise interference. Charge while sleeping, use for 6-8+ hours.Only downside...for me...is that it's difficult to sleep with it on your ear.Overall: I dig it."
4,Works unless you forget to plug the receiver in,"So, i bought this even after reading the neg reviews, and i still have to give the 4 stars... have been using a month now for skype usePros-decent sound-works well for short/moderate distances-clear volume-works well with skype and msnNegs-drops off a few times-if you forget to plug in the receiver, doesn't work (ok an unfair neg, but with all the things one uses USB ports for its easy to forget once and a whileit did help that i paid $25 for it, so i think i got value for money"
3,AN AVERAGE PRODUCT,"As some other reviewers have mentioned, it worked fine for the first couple of times but not so well afterwards. It's range is not even close to 30 feet that's claimed by the manufacturer.I am using it every now and then and always with some statics in the background. it's not worth the price."
1,TRUST ALL THOSE NEGATIVE REVIEWS - THEYRE CORRECT,EXTREMELY FRUSTRATINGLY DISAPPOINTED- ESPECIALLY W/ THE MICROSOFT NAME ATTACHED. WOULD EXPECT IT TO PLUG AND PLAY- NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WORKING THAT WAY. MAYBE PLUG & EASY CD INSTALL- NOPE NO HELP FROM CD INSTALL. INSTRUCTION BOOK- AGAIN NO HELP EXCEPT FOR THE TREES SAVED FROM LACK OF MATERIAL.i GIVE UP TRYING TO GET IT TO WORK ON 2 SEPERATE COMPUTERS AND O/S VISTA & XP. I HOPE OFFICE DEPOT TAKES BACK THIS $70 AND ALOT OF WASTED TIME HEADSET. DO NOT BUY- DO NOT BUY- DO NOT BUY
1,Piece of Crap,"This thing sucks. Dies quickly, cheap quality, and has entirely failed all together. Microsoft is warrantying it for me but save your time and buy a wired headset."
1,How low can you go?,This unit produces bad sound all the time; cuts off all sound 'around the corner'. Ear pad material is low end.Finally threw it away. Wasn't worth the trouble of treating it respectfully.
2,Well bought this for the xbox 360,"I thought this would be easy to connect and use with an xbox 360... and i was wrong... my brother eventually found out how to connect it to the xbox, but by then i had already purchased turtlebeaches."
1,Bad Audio,"Very poor audio, i got this for my games online, and it has an awful audio, it didn't work right, to expensive for what it is"
2,Not compatible with Xbox,"Bought this headset a few years ago when I bought my first Xbox. Seen in the description somewhere that it said it can be used on both PC and Xbox, but not so. Only makes your controllers and headpiece from Xbox compatible with PC.I read a forum that said Xbox does not have the software installed that is required to use with the headset. I still have this headset, but haven't used it. Was trying to find a work around for this problem because my other headset now has a short battery life. Maybe just swapping the batteries will work."
1,Product does not do what it was sold to do,I purchased the Life Chat zx-6000 to use on my laptop with Skype. hrrm first challenge and not yet resolved is getting Skype to recognise it as a microphone/headset so I cannot use this piece of widgetry. Well I could if I wanted to use it with Messenger but I dont. Microsoft help won't help because I want to use it with Skype so I sit here and wave goodbye to A$90. Not happy. Has anyone succeeded in making this work? if so how did you do it? :(
4,Great for the price,"Unlike some of the other people im not disappointed at all, i paid $4 for mine because i know how to shop. The sound is good and it says the range is only 30 feet. I am just estimating, but i would say up to 30 for clear, up to 50 for a conversation, and any farther gets chppy. works perfect for music, especailly at night. throw on WMP or something and use my mouse to change songs and everything from 8 feet away. Wireless mouse with programable buttons, perfect set up. The sound on it is really good too. If i can choose between listening to this and my ipod, i choose this."
1,Don't Buy This,"What can I say, poor mic volume, noise in sound, does not fit my ear well. Pure waste of money and time."
2,Did not work with Xbox,"Did not work with XBox even though it popped up when I typed in ""Wireless Headphones Xbox"" into Amazon product bar."
1,This product has no redeeming qualities,"I was looking to replace a USB sound card I use for gaming chat, and saw this on the shelf. I took it home and had a terrible time trying to get the software to install (I downloaded it rather than using the CD it came with to make sure I had the latest version). I finally had to give up because Microsoft's installer barely functioned with Vista, and it never did complete.Once I got it up and running, I logged on to our Ventrilo server, where I was immediately told how awful my voice sounded (subpar AM radio quality was the description). I heard myself through their connections and realized it was awful. After a few searches I discovered it wasn't just mine - almost everything I read that wasn't a sales pitch said how crappy it was.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!"
2,ITS OKAY.... BUT NOT FOR ME......,I BOUGHT THIS SO I CAN TALK TO MY FELLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPLORERS ON MSN. WHEN I TRIED IT OUT IT DIDN'T WORK. I ASLO HAD A HARD TIME GETTING IT TO CONNECT AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE MIC ISN'T SO COMFY LIKE AS DISCRIBED. IT GET UNCOMFORTABLE AFTER A FEW HRS. IF I HAD TO BUY THIS AGAIN I WOULDN'T. THIS JUST ISNT A GREAT PRODUCT.
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH XBOX 360!,This does not work with an Xbox 360. 1 star for amazon having it under headsets for the xbox 360 and 1 star for microsofts deceiving tactics.
2,Great product marred by bad software,"I returned mine after spending about 14 hours installing, removing, reinstalling, cleaning the registry, searching HP's web support site, etc. with no success. HP's support has been no help, and my visit to the HP scanner support forum was no help either--much of the talk was about class action suites and BBS complaints.The hardware and feature set is great, but HP apparently is having a problem managing their software development. I know I can't afford to spend this much time trying to get a technically mature, commodity product to perform its advertised function."
1,konica minolta a200 not what it is cracked up to be,"I bought the Konica Minolta A200 , took it on vacation with me, took numerous pictures with it and printed several of them. The quality of the prints were awful, I have a HP 3.3 mp digital camera that take much better pictures. I have tried different program for printing the pictures, I have went through the manual, I have used the tripod, nothing seems to work. If there is not anything wrong with this camera it is not worth $552, and I have no vacation pictures to enjoy & share."
4,Konica-Minolta A200,"Although I've had the camera a short time, I've found the quality similiar to my Minolta 35mm SLRs. At first I thought the learning curve was going to be a daunting task but if you take it one step at a time its not so bad; its just remembering all the features that K-M has given you in one small package. I do wish that the camera had a longer telephoto like the Z-5, however, the lens range is what I use the most often anyway. With the card adapter that I purchase, I can use both Compact Flash and SD cards. People mention size and compared to my 35mm SLR they are similiar and the A200 is a good secure fit for the hand. I also appreciate the range of the adjustable LCD viewer, it certainly makes it easier to handle some of those shots you want without having to get in awkward positions. I probably could have given it 5-stars but I need more time with it."
3,CDs loose in textbook,"The Nachalo Book 2 arrived quickly and in good condition. However, I am disappointed because the two Listening Comprehension CDs that come with the textbook were both put inside the pages of the book uncovered. I'm not sure yet whether the CDs are damaged, but I will be disappointed if scratches resulting from this careless packaging ruin the CDs. A soft slipcover for the CDs would have been sufficient."
5,Excellent sound for the price,"I bought these speakers as a replacement for a set of a similar pair, whose sound was only regular. The change with these speakers was noticeable. I am very happy with my purchase."
2,bad day,All I found with this game was the only thing I was racing was wheels their where no bodys to the cars at all. So I would go and get need for speed before ever getting this game
2,"If it werent for the music, this game would recive a 1 star","- Test Drive 5 is the latest TD game i've ever tried since the first game (old timers should remember that game ;) )... Anyways, except for good and detailed tracks/roads, and its music, this game sucks! I mean, look at the graphics, its like we are back at the old NES days: The cars looks like cans, cars sounds? There isent any. They sound like tractors ready to be burried, the handling? NONE AT ALL! The game is almost impossible to complete (unless you know some sort of cheat). Shame on you, who ever made this game... Before making a game, learn to design better graphics and 3D designs!Anyone who write good stuffs about this game...."
1,Not worth your time--yet,"Test Drive 5 for the PC is in a class with some very spectacular driving games. However, Test Drive 5 falls short of its competitors. It seems fine, but if you ever play Need for Speed III or Microsoft's Midtown Madness, you will gladly toss Test Drive 5 into the trash. The cars look nothing like their real counterparts, most tracks are locked, the cars do not handle well, and you cannot go ""off-course"", which is one of the best things about TD5's competitors. I would recommend putting your money toward a more worthy game, such as NFS 3 or Midtown Madness."
4,Slightly dirty old man writes for same,"I found this book hidden away in our home when I was a kid. Mom caught me reading it and yelled at Dad for putting it in an obvious place. Now that I read it again in the 21st Century, it looks pretty tame. This guy was pretty funny and had a long career.I gave the book to my Dad for Father's Day, as Mom had thrown his original copy away years ago (probably to protect the Grandkids)."
3,"Awesome Recipes, but...","I have to say it to warn the vegetarians - this book is not vegetarian. It is meatless, I'll give it that, but it calls for omnivorous cheeses, and this is by the own author's admission, where she describes one of the cheeses as being from the rennet/lining of a baby lamb's stomach.For an omnivore, this book is great. For lacto-ovo vegetarians and vegans, who know which vegetarian products to use and automatically know when a recipe calls for an omnivorous item what they can whip up, it is a gem as well.Just a warning to people who are vegetarian and don't have access to rennet-free cheeses or vegan cheeses.Edited to add: This book also has meat stocks in it, recipes calling for veal carcasses and such. I want to grab a marker and black-out the deathly words."
3,Surprised by Construction,"Did not expect so much MDF in a Swedish workbench and was a little disappointed by the how the drawers were assembled. The red edging in the photos (mine were grey) are actually plastic clips that hold the drawers together. Concerned about how well these construction methods will hold up. Figured out from another review not to assemble bench until this unit arrived (they shipped separately), would have to agree as this replaces some parts."
1,Particle Board?,"This was a present so I can't complain too much. I don't want to hurt the givers feelings.Man! All I can say is Sjobergs, lose the Particle Board! I'd pay whatever it takes to get at least plywood. I'm going to customize and build my own plywood drawer bottoms, leg supports and table back. No more Sjobergs for me!"
5,"Candid, illusion-shattering, provocative","Klemp candidly shares the sometimes-overwhelming difficulties that face anyone who seriously wants to find the God beyond religion, beyond words, beyond ideas. I urge anyone who is secure in his/her religion to have the courage to read it- for me, it shattered illusions I had- that there was some definite, programmatic way to find God that would not result in any great pain after one made real contact! The hugeness and intensity of the God beyond bromides and Sunday sermons is hinted at, as we follow Klemp's journey to God-Realization and the unexpected difficulties in living in this world with that changed consciousness."
5,Clear and well written,"The subject matter seems a little unbelievable, but when you read the down home style, this is a writer who I cannot imagine is 'just' telling a story. I liked wondering whether he imagined or lived a journey to God Realization, but get the sense that he really did live it.Harold Klemp really sounds genuine. How many religious figures are willing to say that they went into an insane asylum on their oath to a greater truth? None that I know.I admire the honesty, and also the good writing. VERY easy to read, very readable. I liked it a lot."
5,One man's path to God Realization.,"This book contains perhaps the most honest and revealing description of one man's quest for God Realization ever written. Harold Klemp's path was not easy, and he pulls no punches in describing the process.A must read for anyone seriously interested in learning about the religious experience of God."
5,A good LONG ratchet,"I bought this set as I particulary wanted a long 3/8 drive.I was sceptical about the flex head as I had a cheap one before and it moves when you lean on it, this one doesn't !A high teeth count so a very small working arc.Good set which I recomend."
2,Buy an HP,"After having problems with Canon printers and hearing good things about Epson I bought this All in One. It works okay - the print quality is good. But the software/drivers are terrible (use a lot of memory - slow down the system) The printer always defaults to Glossy paper and then takes 2 minutes to print a single page. You have to manually change to regular paper each time. (I have tried changing the default settings and it reverts back to glossy). I could not get this printer to work at all on one of my computers. It is also annoying (as other reviewers mentioned, not to be able to print in black and white when one of the color cartridges is gone.)"
2,If you like to buy extra ink,"Beware...all cartridges must have ink to print! Out of Magenta? Want to print a black-and-white letter? Too Bad. Buy Epson's magenta first.Epson has shown poor form by giving this printer a severe weakness. Otherwise, like most Epson printers, this is a quality printer with a good scanner and good software. That's why I gave this 2 stars instead of 1.Still, when ink is almost the same price as a cheap printer, this weakness is a big deal."
1,Beware! Poor quality & holds all functions hostage to buying ink.,"Poor image quality that diminishes quickly over time and clogs. I had this printer for 4 years and regretted it. The worst problem--and it's a big one--is that although it is a multifunction device, it DISABLES all functions (including the option of printing/copying using black ink only) if ANY of the ink cartridges is empty! For example, if you run out of Cyan ink, even if you select Black Ink Only in the Advanced print options, it will not print until you go out an buy/install another Cyan cartridge. It also will not scan, fax, copy (in B&W) or anything. It locks you in a ""Replace ___ ink"" cycle of doom. There is no way to bypass this. Any decent printer company would allow customers to at least SCAN a document without all 4 ink cartridges. I threw it away when this happened. Didn't even donate it, because I don't want anyone else to spend a dime on Epson ink."
1,works great...until it doesn't,"Like others, I was happy with the printer. But then after changing the black ink one time...no more black ink. This is the second Epson we have owned that had this problem. Both times about 1-1/2 years after purchase (you guessed it--out of warranty). The first time they offered us this printer at a big discount. But it's not worth the hassle.DO NOT BUY unless you view this as a 1-2 yr. disposable product."
1,Epson CX6600 Unreliable for photo printing,"First CX6600 stopped printing complete photos, or none at all, within a year's use. It was replaced by Epson and now, four months later, replacement behaves the same way.Replacement is difficult, as original must be returned (postage free)to a FedEx pickup point. Carton too heavy for me to lift and carry.From the reviews I've just read, I am not the only unhappy consumer. Epson has furnished corrective procedures which I used with the first printer, but will not do so again - too much ink used, too expensive, and totally ineffective. Will call Epson as directed and make it clear I do not want another CX6600."
2,Clogged heads - all the time,"The print quality is great, but I am so fed up with this model. After only owning it a few months, the heads clogged and I was able to exchange it (for a refurbished one) directly through Epson. Then, the second one's heads became clogged and I had to exchange that one. Next, a month later, that 3rd printer's heads became clogged and I had to exchange that one. Finally, my current CX6600 just clogged up!! I called Epson and told them I would scream if they sent me another cx6600. They agreed to send me a CX7800 (reburished) as a replacement. I am now awaiting my replacement and hope it is much better. Don't know if anyone else had the same problem, but my yellow ink head was the clogged one most of the time. The Epson rep said that sometimes bad batches of ink can ""get through"" their quality control. Who knows. But I would avoid this model if at all possible."
1,Scanner Biggest Disappointment,"Wow! What a mistake. I took a sales rep's advice and bought this item from O.M. Print quality is certainly satisfactory, but I had to clean the nozzles after FIVE PAGES! The worst of this device's issues is the scanner. Regardless of how high you set the resolution, the scanned object looks horrible. B&W images come out impossible to see. The accompanying photo management software is about the worst I have ever seen. If you're looking for a printer, this might be OK, but for other features, I would not even remotely recommend it. Good luck!"
1,Epson CX6X00 (6400 or 6600) Support for Printer Drivers,"The Setup CD that came with my CX6400 Epson Stylus printer has become lost (HELP!). I've gone to the web site to download current drivers (at the recommendation of the Epson CS response to my dilemma), but can't seem to find the ""original CD"" driver information at all! I get pieces. Since this is an ""all in one"" printer, I would like the original software, not pieces (one driver for printer, another for the scanner--that doesn't work). If you are searching for a printer, stick with the tried and true HP printers. I've never had so much trouble with an HP printer. (And if you have the original setup CD for the CX6400 printer, I'd like to BUY it!) THANKS!"
1,Will not scan if ink is low.,"Inks dry up every few months. Scanner won't work if any one if the inks is low even though this feature has nothing to do with printing. I called customer service, they confirmed this, apologized and said nothing could be done. I would not recommend purchasing any Epson scanners/printer unless you want to be stuck buying new ink every few months."
1,Beware All Things Epson,"Unfortunately, we have an Epson printer, the older brother of this model (the CX6400). Epson had a class-action suit brought against them a couple of years ago, and with good reason--their ink cartridges register empty when they are nothing of the sort. You can hear the ink slosh around inside after the printer tells you it's out. The result of the suit was a coupon for $45 of Epson swag...obviously, printer manufacturers get you on ink, but Epson's the king. The printer doesn't even fade, it simply refuses to go another step. Perhaps the Epson Jackass would be a better name? What's more, the nozzles clog regularly, the print quality suffers consistently, and you have to perform diagnostics and cleaning routinely. Avoid this model and anything like it, lest you have a giant money-sucking paperweight anywhere near your workspace."
1,RUN AWAY from this printer - Deserves NO STARS,"This printer is the worst printer I have ever had in my entire life. The ink heads get clogged all the time and every time I have to run a head cleaning, it uses up all the good ink in the printer. I have had to buy cartridge after cartridge and wasted TONs of money on this. Do not even accept a FREE Epson printer. They are bad news!!"
1,Not worth the money,"This printer has been a problem from the start. It only prints good photos if you go through it's ""program"" which is a pain in the rear. It flies through ink, which puts you out a good $50 to replace. The head gets clogged if you go any length of time without printing. Over all I have been VERY disapointed and would not buy another Epson."
2,Epson CX6600 costly to use and veryt fickle,"I got my CX6600 new at Comp USA at a deep discount. Photo quality print was excellent but it really sucked a lot of ink. Ink was costing me twice as much as with my Lexmark Z52 and the photo quality was not significantly better. Less than three months later the factory had to ship me a replacement. Why? Because just after I printed out about 20 beautiful 8 x 10's of my wife, the printer sat idle for two weeks, and the print heads dried and would not work with brand new Epson ink cartridges no matter how many times I ran ""head cleaning."" Epson said the second printer they sent me was new but it had the loudest paper feeder I've ever heard. It also sucks ink though so far it produces beautiful prints. I have to run ""head cleaning"" anytime I go more than just a few days without doing some printing which uses all of the color cartridges. I'd not buy this printer again."
2,good for a year and then useless,"as some other reviewers have mentioned, this Epson worked great for about a year or year and half, and then printing and scanning problems started. Ink goes quickly, clogged jets, very poor life expectency! I just ordered a Canon and hope their quality is MUCH better. I will never buy an Epson again. Or Dell, or HP....goodness, I do hope the Canon brand is a better product. My Canon digital camera is super so I am keeping fingers crossed for the same of their printers!"
5,Amazing print quality,"This printer works perfectly for my needs: light printing and occasional scanning for faxes. I have printed some photos with it on some glossy paper, and they look fantastic. Don't expect blazing speeds when printing photos. Printing a full page photo on 8.5x11 can take several minutes (but it will look amazing).Epsons have also gotten much quieter recently - my last Epson inkjet was very loud and took a long time to warm up. This one is fast and quiet.The card reader has been handy, it just acts like any other card reader (insert the card and then you can browse the files by drive letter).Overall, I am very happy with the printer."
2,Good while it lasted...just didn't last too long...,"I purchased my CX6600 about 2 years ago. It really worked well but used way too much ink. Recently, it just stopped printing. Well, the yellow only prints. I've done everything imaginable to get it to print again. Too bad since I just bought extra ink too. I'm going to try out the Canon all in one. While the price of this Epson wasn't bad, I expected it to last a bit longer. Heck, I have 10 year old printers that still work."
2,Great...at first,"This printer held up pretty well for about a year. Picture printing was so-so at best, but I am in the military so basically I use it for printing forms and records. After only a year and a couple black ink replacements I have to continually do head cleaning in order to get a decent print. If I go two or three days without printing...its time to clean it again. I cant tell you how many pieces of paper I wasted by clicking print without cleaning the print heads first. The basics of this printer are sub par and I DO NOT recommend this product."
1,Lasted 1 Year Thats All,"Bought the unit, and was very impressed with it. Then after a change of the black ink, the unit started printing badly. The New black did not work. So I bought another new Black. Then the Cyan quit working, then nothing would print. Replace all inks, and even bought the Epson company cleaning kit for $10.00. Nothing. Unit never printer again. No help from Epson on this at all. Reviews from the wed, say very much the same things, 1yr then replace it. I got a new Canon mp530. will try this one. BUT I WOULD NEVER!!!!!!!!! BUY AN EPSON AGAIN!!!!!"
1,Bad news,I've had this printer for about 14 months. Worked fine until the yellow print head plugged. Tried the self cleaning mode - no luck plus this mode uses a tremendous amount of ink - Tried for several weeks to clean with a cleaning solution but was just too stopped up to clear the clog. Then the whole thing just quit printing. I would start it up and it would shut it's self off. It's in the trash now.
1,Printer Stops Printing,Epson should be ashamed of themselves for pushing this kind of trash on the public. The printer just stops putting ink to paper. It is a complete waste of money.
1,Run away from any CX6600,I bought this printer because of the good reviews it had on several magazines. After a year or so it would not print in black. I tried several times cleaning the head. It wouldn't budge. Now it stop printing all together. I bought a Canon that gives me superb photos unlike any that I printed on the CX6600.Next time you see a CX6600 run away from it.
2,Waaay overated,I see positive comments on this printer and ask why? What do people want in a good printer. Fast Speed: This printer prints out pictures that are sloow. I can go have lunch come back and the print is ready. Compact: This printer is a lug. There are many all in one printers that don't take up the space this one does. Ink Usage: ok in fact one of the positives about this printer is there is a lot of inexpensive generic ink out there. Scanner: Works very well a positive for this machine. Copier: I thought very slow. Functions well though.I've used a lot of printers and if you like the quality of oem ink canon and hp are excellent. If you like generic ink you can't beat canon's printers for price speed and affordable ink. Dump this model.
1,Failed After 3 years,"Like many others on this page, my Epson has failed to work. It has to due with the print head failing. I'm very disappointed. Besides that, it was a good printer however don't let the cheap price fool you now. My next printer will not be an Epson."
1,Dead after a year.,I wish I would have read these reviews before I spent $70 on ink cartridges. Color was working fine on my CX6600 but black had gaps all over so I ran the head cleaning to fix it to no avail. After several cleanings the colors were all out so I decided to replace all 4 colors and now NOTHING WORKS!!! How can replacing the ink cartridges with brand new ones make this thing not work? I get faint smudges of black but that's it. I called a repair center and they said it would be $30 just to diagnose the problem and from what I've read here actually fixing the problem would cost as much as a whole new printer and why the heck would I want to fix this piece of junk.
1,"Great when it works, but...","I had CX6600 for a year and a half now, and I must say that we had a great year, and then as soon as the warranty expired it started breaking down. First it wouldn't copy, I was a little annoyed but figured if I needed to copy something I could scan it and then print it out. And then slowly quality of printouts started to deteriorate, and now all I get are blank pages. I have tried all the suggested steps to fix this, and still nothing. So after a year and a half all I have is a very bulky scanner.All in all very good unit when it works, but that problem is that it doesn't."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!I HAVE HAD 4 EPSON CX 6400 LOSERS REPLACEDTHE LAST WAS REPLACED WITH A CX6600ALL FAILED WITHIN 60-90 DAYSAND I STILL CAN'T PRINT!!!!!!
1,avoid at all costs,"If you love long nights of frustration for no reason, this is the printer for you. Avoid at all costs."
1,Pretty much all said but i am so mad......,"We bought the epson while being on an oversea tour in germany.we payed alot of money for it only to learn that while on the move to the us, the nozzels clogged really bad, my husband spent nights trying to fix it, after about a week, only the yellow nozzel was clogged, but now because of all the test brinting the colors were empty ,and thats when it completely broke.after replaceing the cartridges.now we had it for 5 month and the dumb thing is in the trash, great, what a waste of money."
1,First day - Regret it already.,"I wanted to replace my Canon All in One with the Epson cx6600. I hate it already. I printed pictures from my digital camera and it took forever. The quality is horrible for a photoprinter. I copied the upc code on the box for the rebate and even the copy quality was poor. If I could send it back, I would. I should have bought a new Canon. Don't make the same mistake I did. Don't buy the Epson CX6600."
1,Handle with care,"Having lost an aging PC I had to either replace my SCSI scanners card with a new one, or replace the scanner. The Epson all in one seemed a good bpackage, having owned it now for 6 months I have bought a new SCSI card for the old scanner and brought it back to life.The basic problems are all software related -No support for network printing in its native driver and a real struggle to overcome this.Scanning software is crude and simplistic making it impossible to scan to any quality. Why does it default to scan to card rather than scan to PC? How often would anyone want to?In life you get what you pay for, I should have bought a decent scanner!"
1,Do not buy this printer,"This is my second and last Epson printer. Both worked fine and then suddenly, after about three months, it starts putting out blank pages. I have run every diagnostic, cleaning routine to no avail."
3,Mine seems to be clogged too,"I've had this printer for about five years and never had any problems with it, but recently the black ink is coming out all blurry. Putting in a new cartridge does not fix the problem, so I guess I must have the dreaded clogged printhead issue that seems to be the source of much angst in these reviews. I'm going to try one of those clog buster products, but I'm not feeling real optimistic right now. I'll probably have to get a new printer from the sound of it. I really like this printer because I can get replacement remanufactured cartridges for ridiculously cheap which keeps the per page cost very low. The print quality used to be quite good (before the clog), even producing decent photos. Speed wasn't too bad either. I also like the copy and scan capabilities. This clog thing is bumming me out. I'm giving it three stars in honor of several years of excellent service, but failing on me now. Maybe I'm being too harsh."
2,"Clogged printer heads can't be cleaned, Dont purchase",Loved my Epson All-In-One printer until it just went over its year waranty. Then the printer would not print even though the ink cartridges were 70% full of ink. The Epson troubleshooting guide said to replace cartridge with new ones when cleaning the printer heads mutiple times didn't work. I wasted money buying 4 Epson replacement cartridges and still not getting the printer to print. Gave 2 ** since the scanner still works. Fortunately I have a backup HP printer.
1,CX6600 Failed printing after a year and a half,My CX6600 developed problems after about a year of service and after a year and a half has quit printing almost entirely.The black is streaky and the color cartridges won't print at all.I will never buy an Epson again and I am advising my colleagues to do the same.I see the Canon $500.00 model is rated the highest with end users. Here I come.Epson quality has deteriorated so much over the last few years that their printers are a disgrace to the industry.
1,The velcro attachment lowers sanding efficiency,"I use the Fein sander constantly as I build my Cozy MkIV aircraft: both the cuting blads and the sanding attachments. The velcro-attached pads suffer from problems. First, the velcro allows motion between the pad and the sandpaper so that you only get part of each vibratory strok transmitted to the paper. Second, the hooks (the fuzzy part) tend to pull off the sandpaper with moderate use causing an even less direct connection between the pad and the sandpaper.I recommend you stay away from the velcro sandpaper and instead use the adhesive-backed sandpaper. I get long life and very efficient sanding action with that sandpaper."
5,Highly recommended!,"I recommend this book to ALL my PhD. students. I recommend it to you! Your university's specific format may differ, but a dissertation proposal guided by this book will be thorough and conceptually useful as a road map for the dissertation itself."
4,Doctor Moss,"I've been reading this book to help me prepare for the doctoral dissertation. So far, it has been very helpful and guided me to a better understanding of writing this document. I can highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a head start on writing a proposal for a research paper."
3,Great source...,The suggestions made in this book are very practical and applicable to the development of your dissertation. I recommend this product.
2,Few interesting tracks,"Took forever to find this CD, and I was hoping for a decent album because I found one song I heard from it, Meriasie Street, profoundly interesting. Sadly the rest of the CD was mostly uninspired filler.Well at least I learned something. I wouldn't take a risk like this again."
5,best of...,"i bought this album when it came out, and even though its not the original track list (how can you omit 'the day i met god?'), its them at there very best.Same as a lot of bands they went down hill after starting out superb.there is nothing like this album.Quality and original still."
1,its small,"its a very small bag, cant even fit my check book into it but i could have over looked that but today the clippy thing that hold the strap to the bag broke. it just feel apart on me.theres no returning it for me since i have already thrown out my packing slip so kids remember you get what you pay for.."
3,Not exactly what you may need,"I was a little disappointed in the book. I thought that it would give me ideas of Scottish traditions that I could incorporate into my upcoming wedding. However, the book was more about wedding planning in general and less about Scottish traditions. It did give me some ideas and reminders on things to do for my ceremony and reception, but not a whole lot on how to make my wedding more traditionally Scottish."
1,Useless,This book is a waste of paper. Little to no useful information or insight into wedding traditions in Scotland. Dull.
4,It sands but does tend to clog,I'm sanding old varnish so maybe that is the problem. Took off only one star for the colgging issue. It works just fine on bare wood.
5,a good buy,These sandpaper triangles are performing as well or better than those that came originally with this Fein powertool. The price is reasonable; a good investment indeed.
3,"good product, MUCH too expensive","I use my Fein Mulimaster frequently. It always performs brilliantly. The accessories, including this sandpaper, always works well. However, Fein's accessories are ridiculously expensive."
2,Average sandpaper at a premium price,"This paper sands well when new but clogs quickly with plastic paints and the grain coverage seems less dense than many papers. Overall it is about average but due to the unique size and no real alternative brands, its a premium price for average paper."
5,Great Buy for Dremel,"Purchased the Fein 80 Grit 50-Pack to with my Dremel Multi-Max Oscillating Tool. They fit great and are significantly cheaper than the ones from Dremel. If you're trying to save some money and get a great product you need to look no further. Very happy with this purchase, especially since I didn't have to buy a variety pack which is what most Dremel products come in."
3,Unit cost too high,"Like all Fein products, they do the job but the cost/benefit ratio is too high. I have moved to some other brand sanding sheets at 75% of cost"
4,Burnishing tool,"Nice and heavy. Needed a good tool to remove air bubbles when applying clear plastic laminate. Wanted one edge rounded so as not to score plastic. Other side of roller has edge to press laminate close to edge of photos, etc."
4,The Curse of Living Too Long,"I read this novel over 30 years ago, so much of the details are lost to memory. It's the story of an aging bush guide in sub-Saharan Africa coming to terms with the changing world around him, a world that has no place for him. I found it wonderfully evocative of semi-Westernized southern Africa, and a poignant depiction of a ""man out of time."" I highly recommend this book.By the way, it's ""Jack Bennett"", not ""Jack, Bennett""."
5,Simply Brilliant - Best muffin yet,Excellent entertaining spy story with subtle twists and a great ending. I've read this twice now since it was published and even knowing the ending it was still a thoroughly good read.
3,Madden Football 1999,"Madden football 99's realistic color and pressure makes you feel like you're in the game. The reason I would give it only 3 stars is that sometimes the sound studders, passes don't get off as quickly as you might want, and you have to have a good computer to use it. Despite the small problems you may experience, the game is like the real thing. They even ""bring out the chains"" if it is hard to decide whether or not it is a first down. You can make trades, have drafts, and sign for free agents. Over all, the game is a good way to pass time, play with your friends, or just have fun."
3,Good,I am ten years old. I liked Alice in Wonderland but it should be described more. If that was the only flaw I would have given it 4 stars but sometimes its hard to concentrat on the conversation
2,Huh ?,"This book reminds me of watching Henry Kissinger being interviewed by William F. Buckley, Jr. on FIRING LINE. Poor Henry spoke so deliberately and so s-l-o-w-l-y that I genuinely couldn't follow what he was saying. His cannonballs could barely make it out of the barrel of his cannon.Up until reading this book I thought I would never again have to experience that excruciating pain. This volume is an excellent edition of esoterica and historical trivialties. Whatever ""magic"" one might hope to find in ""Alice's ..."" is almost immediately lost in trying to read the copious notes in the margins. (My bad?) I had hoped for something less pedantic and sterile. (My bad? ... doesn't some slang just make you wince?)Anyway, be advised - if you're having trouble getting to sleep, this book is for you. (wink, wink)"
2,Some classic.,This book was confusing and the story was horrible. I think that this is a bad book. The characters eccentric and not that interesting. I didn't like it one bit.
3,Sjobergs SJ1200 Compact Jointer Workbench,"Underbuilt & overpriced. The two wood vices are ""toy"" like."
2,"Disappointing function, beautiful form","I really wanted to like this watering can, but it's only got good looks going for it. As a simple watering tool, it falls surprisingly short. The last two-thirds of water comes out in spurts, as opposed to a steady stream, which makes me think something about the design is prohibiting the uptake of water. Then, it's nearly impossible to completely pour out the can until empty, unless you rock it back and forth sloshing the water out or turn it over and shake it out. Since I was looking for a more than just a decorative object, I'm afraid this has to go back to the store."
1,beware!,"i bought this watering can to replace an old metal one that i had purchased from walmart over two years ago. i was searching for something to replace my 'perfect' can that had sprung many leaks due to being left out in the sun...i am, however, disappointed to find out from the sticker on the bottom of the can that it contains lead. having small children, i am now going to be returning this product to the store i purchased it at and searching for a different can.also, as a previous reviewer stated, this can does not pour water easily during the final half quart or so that it holds. i would tolerate that, because it's very elegant looking, but i cannot tolerate having a product with lead within easy reach of my kids."
4,Excellent if you like country,"I got this CD when it first came out in 2000, and I I still love it 2 years later! I had never heard of Adam Gregory before, but I decided to give the Canadian boy's music a chance. Now I am a big fan, and bought his follow-up CD, Workin On It. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes country music that is mellow and not too twangy. It's good stuff to drive to, relaxing."
1,Why can't we give this no stars?,"This is the worst country singer I've ever heard. He's absolutely horrible, like most country music, but country really sucks here! I can't stand his boring, boring music. Save your money and don't buy this album, ever, even if it's free. This is crap. Nuff said."
5,hitch cover,"I am totally satisfied with my Hula-Honu Hitch Cover. People are always asking where it's from. Of course, Honolulu"
3,Doesn't come with reciever bolt,"This is a nice hitch cover but it's missing the most important part, the 5/8"" bolt to hold it in the receiver."
5,"Great collection, useful for students of SF","This book presents a body of one woman's opinions. This might not sound like much but, given that these are Ursula Le Guin's opinions, it is well worth reading. She writes entertainingly and even though she wants to make you think it does not hurt one bit. Given the dearth of decent criticism of Science Fiction available at student level prices this is an excellent introduction to the genre for them. It is probably the first time most of them will have discovered serious thought behind SF. She also addresses other issues, often concerning her own experiences and the problems of being a woman writer, which would make this a useful text for anyone interested in gender studies. To sum up, buy it; it is very good; you will read these essays more than once, guaranteed."
5,refreshing historical perspective,It is refreshing to finally hear from a very well-educated author about the unbiased truth of history and the Saxon people.His footnotes and sources(unlike most liberally biased propaganda)CHECK OUT!
2,Not as good as the 1967 edition,"I was so excited to find this book on my university library shelf... the orignal 2 volume set, that is. I couldn't find those anywhere, so finally I ordered the new version. This one is printed in New Delhi and has a very shabby binding. The examples seem to be all hand-drawn and crude compared to the older books. It still gives an excellent view of all alphabets of all time."
4,great resource,"Amazing Cd by amazing guitarist with some little known tracks. I play Sua Cosa and this is the first time I have found a recording of it. The Leo Brower compositions are also spectacular. You have to be ready for some edgy pop and punk sounds, not your grandmother's classical guitar."
5,An inspirational testament to Basic Goodness,"This is a rich and moving account about how conditions conspired to bring heightened awareness of truth to one man and through him to many others. If you're afraid of prisons and prisoners, this is a must read. Your fear might dissipate in seeing that what separates ""us"" from ""them"" is the finest of lines. Fleet's antidote to the suffering of incarceration applies as much to people living within those concrete structures called prisons as it does to those of us on the ""outside."" Fleet surrendered to the antidote. He says he didn't have a choice. Since then he's worked tirelessly to make it accessible to others, regardless of where they reside."
3,SO OLD!!!!,"O.K. The Only good songs on this cd areTerror Squad: Lean BackJoJo: Leave(Get Out)Nina Sky: Move Ya BodyLindsay Lohan: RumorsNelly: My PlaceHalf of these song or to old like:Baby Bash: Suga Suga This song appers on the second volume of this sires Unversal Smash Hits vol.2 I dont know why the put the same song again on this cd.I Think ""NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC"" Is Better!!UNIVERSAL SMASH HITS VOL.3 SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Best dress socks you can buy.,"I've been buying Gold Toe dress socks for a while and I also now buy Gold Toe athletic socks for the same reason. They last longer than the others and retain their shape better too. These Nassau style Gold Toe are my preferred black dress sock as they are a nice blend of fabric. Feel good, stay up on the calf (the elastic last long), and last a long time. I recommend this product."
2,Declining quality,"I have been purchasing primarily Gold Toe socks for some time now as I found their quality to be better than their competitors. However, I have come to question that with my recent experience with these socks. I purchased two supposedly identical packs of socks, and yet the socks in one pack are a full 2.5"" shorter than the socks in the other pack. The labels on the pack are the same, and both sets are clearly the Nassau design (same cotton and weaving). Maybe they were short on cotton one day. It unfortunately make sorting socks when doing laundry even more of a pain. I contacted the company and they wanted me to ship both sets of socks to them at my expense so they could inspect them to decide whether I deserved a replacement.Even worse, these socks showed significant wear and pilling after only one use, which is not something I would have expected from Gold Toe socks."
3,Dog Muzzle,For some reason the muzzle still lets my dog bark i thought it wouldnt but he is still able to other than that he cant get it off though which is good i just dont know what else to do.
2,It's ok,"As aisle runners go, it's ok. Looks sturdy enough. I am terribly disappointed that I got the heart pattern instead of the flower pattern that I ordered. And I did not get an email to explain that such a substitution would be made as I would have cancelled.(I make this comment here because there is no option to leave Seller Feedback for this product). I agree with Kusuma A that the heart's pattern is subtle, but I will most likely have to order another runner."
2,Made out of paper,"Pretty design, but it's not really fabric. It's more like a membrane paper type of deal. Not what I call ""fabric"". Thin, prone to large wrinkles, but hopefully my ushers will be able to flatten it out as they roll..."
4,It differs from the first volume but is good in its own right,The songs on this Cd are loud and wistful. but the first volume has very lovely tracks which flow along well. These are also mostly live. I preferred the first volume and I would not recommend buying this one based on the first. It is good in its own right though. I enjoy it less than the first however.
5,It's a good one...,"Only one thing to say about this album (other than it's typical Annie Gallup greatness!) is, you have to buy this CD if only for the recording of ""Flood""! It is an amazing song that will leave you breathless..."
1,"the positive reviews must be plants, no one has standards that low","Low budget is by no means a disqualifier. Many of my favorite films are extremely low budget ones. However, there is a basic art of movie making that transcends budgets. This movie completely lacks that art, unfortunately. When we watch a movie, we should feel completely absorbed and forget that we're watching a movie, we shouldn't be, as this movie does, constantly reminded of the existence of a very jittery person shooting the film on an ultra low budget (think walmart)-level camcorder. Sorry, but this is just so poorly done that its not even remotely enjoyable to watch."
2,really low budget,"Ever see the movie The Blair Witch whatever? This film was worse!!! I hate that I bought it! I'm sure I've seen worse, but can't remember what."
3,The sound of Oldtime religion,"There's real talent here, enough to overcome the not so great sound quality. Violinaires on this CD have yet to find their own sound, but they're off to a good start. A gem, ""Don't Cry"" should have been a hit, the group is right there with powerful vocal lead from Clifford Porter even with the tough competition it faced in '51. Although all isn't perfect, there is still a lot to like here. The good ones are very, very good."
4,The Acts Model of Church Growth,"In the Upside Down Church Greg Laurie calls on the church to leave slick marketing strategies behind and return to the ministry model demonstrated in the book of Acts. He challenges Christians to refocus their attention to evangelizing their world, committing themselves to God's Word, loving others, praying with power and worshiping in spirit and in truth.Laurie's writing style is humble, down to earth, well illustrated, relevant, and enjoyable. The testimony of his personal ministry calling and the launching of Harvest Church are interesting and God honoring. This isn't a book of techniques or methods but rather a back-to-the-basics model of Biblical mandates and challenges presented by one of the most effective evangelists and pastors of our generation."
2,RIP OFF,"Do not buy this copy. The drawings are well done and it will teach the basics to the advance. Great for any aspiring artist. However, the publishing company made this book VERY VERY VERY SHORT. Not enough pages to get into depth and learn more."
3,Still worth buying.,"Its true, walter foster did ruin this. The pdf files of Loomis's original books show what masterpieces they were when he wrote them, and before this one was cut apart and jammed into thirty-two pages.However, that being said, it still stands as an excellent guide to a beginner on how to start out understanding the form of the human head. I was glad I purchased it years ago, as it explains everything in a very clear and accessable way, with plenty of illustrations."
3,The premiere bookseller of the 20th century,"It's sad that this book about perhaps the greatest bookseller of the 20th century is so flawed. After a too brief introduction to Rosenbach's early bookselling career, the first 150 pages quickly become a list of how much a book was bought for and at what price sold. A lot of the reasons why individual books are important is left out. When so many books are described as the ""finest available"" it quickly becomes repetitive.Luckily after the first 150 pages this book gets better. You get more of a sense of Rosenbach as an individual, including some really funny anecdotes about the books he sold and Rosenbach's customers. It doesn't make up for the first pages but don't give up hope if you keep reading it is worth it.This book included a section of photos in the middle. Interestingly none of the books bought or sold are shown."
4,beautifully done,"a great looking film about characters whose lives keep affecting eachother in ways that they themselves seem to be oblivious to. a film about twists of fate, winter sleepers is at parts slow and probably too clever at times for its own good, but none of this really matters. the film is hauntingly beautiful to look at, with amazing scenery, music , and atmosphere. great performances as well. just a well done, pretty film that deserves way more attention than it has received."
1,"Mis-Framed, Poor Quality.","Winstar did a pretty terrible job on this presentation. Not only is it mis-framed (1.85:1 when it's supposed to be 2.35:1), but the picture quality is extremely hazy at times, and becomes hard to watch."
2,Winter Snoozer,"This 1997 movie from the director ofRun Lola Runwas recommended to me as ""similar toMemento"" but the person who recommended it was totally wrong. One character inWinter Sleepershas a supposed problem with short-term memory loss (and it isn't even very serious) but aside from that there is NOTHING connecting the movies. ""Winter Sleepers"" is more of aCrash/Traffic/Grand Canyonmovie with the lives of six or seven strangers in a small German alpine town intersecting in ironic/surprising ways. The frozen landscape, long quiet shots and uber-moody music (Arvo Part, Wim Mertens & Sussan Deyheim/Richard Horowitz) make for an ""arthouse"" feel even as the plot unfolds as slowly and relentlessly as a glacier.Floriane Daniel and the cinematography are gorgeous but the viewer notices every second of its 117 minutes."
3,Wnter Sleepers,"winter sleepers is a good movie but kind of weird. I liked it ok and i can recomend it to german movie fans, especially ""Heino Ferch"" fans."
5,Classic Tykwer.,"Beautiful scenery in this movie. Director Tom is brilliant when it comes to cinematography. Great story about a group of people, some of which know each other, whose lives are all somehow connected. If you like Run Lola Run, then you'll like this one."
3,Don't expect Run Lola Run,"Something tells me I have no clue what I'm talking about when it comes to this movie. Still, the only reason I rented it was because it's by the director of Run Lola Run which was an incredible movie. And it simply didn't deliver. If you want more of the same, wait for Princess and Warrior - or maybe for Bourne Identity with Franka Potente coming out in May 2002.The sheer obsessiveness with coincidences displayed in this movie is tiring. It may be pretty... but it's not entertaining."
2,"good movie, bad picture quality","Picture quality is quite fuzzy, like a transfer from VHS tape. The trailer is even worse!"
3,My Least Favorite Tykwer Film...and I'm a HUGE fan.,"I don't know what it was, perhaps the copy I saw was horrible, it was a VHS and it looked horrible, even though it was an original it looked like a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy. But this has to be my least favorite of his films. The shots were boring, the story was slow, and I suppose I was comparing it to much to ""Run Lola Run"" with all it's flare and beautiful color.But by the time it ended, the story captured me. The ending (which I'll try not to give away too much) was great. I heard this was one of hte films that inspired Memento. Tykwer sure knows how ti find those intricite stories and bring them home.SO if you love his work, you must watch, but make sure you have a DVD copy. If you didn't love ""Princess and hte Warrior"" you won't like this, if you are expecting another ""Run Lola Run"" I suggest you run the other way."
2,Functional bench (but low quality),"I've been using this bench for 1.5 years and am moderately happy with the functionality of the bench. However, as other reviewers noted, the legs are low quality and inadequate. Also, the metal shaft on the vises has started to rust.The included bench dogs and hold down that came with my bench are nice.My biggest complaint about this bench is that it really isn't very stable for handwork. When hand sawing, the whole bench rocks front to back badly. I guess I could build a new set of legs for the bench, but if I had time for that then I'd go all the way and build my own bench from scratch."
3,"Well made bench, but don't trust the picture.","This is a well built bench; sturdy, stable and with two strong vises. Please be careful, the actual top surface is only an inch thick with a wide apron around the edges; this doesn't come across well in the picture."
2,Average home woodworker review,As noted the top is relatively thin but solid. The primary shortcoming of my bench was a significant crown over the width of the bench which if not corrected or compensated for wrecks havoc with layouts and precision work. The surface is low and leg spacing close requiring fabrication of additional front to back support to eliminate tilting and to elevate the surface. The vise guide tubes are more vunerable to corrosion than most metal tools in my shop.
1,Sjobergs SJ1600 Full-Size Jointer Workbench,I was completely disappointed with this workbench. First the packaging was completely inadequate. There were gouges in the top of the workbench. The metal for the vises was rusty and the apron that the vises used was cracked rendering the vises unoperable. Their were knots on the top of the workbench. While this might not be bad in itself the manufacturers chose to use the knotted wood for the bench dog holes. There is a knot directly adjacent to the bench dog hole. I don't know how this would hold up over time. I have returned the item without replacement.
4,Stable table,"This workbench has been very sturdy and heavy-duty. I do alot of hobby work making wooden decoys and other figures. The table has given me plenty of room for my work and tools. Also, the material is easy to clamp anywhere on the table. All around its a good versatile workbench!"
3,If I only had the time to build one from scratch!,"The bench top is nice. I really like the fit and quality of it, although it is a little thin in the middle. The rest of the bench leaves lots of room for improvement. The vice is functional, but the vice handles look like toy spindles. The base is made of pine (not birch like the bench top) and is seriously lacking in quality and fit. I'm surprised that a workbench costing this much would use such cheap materials. I would be willing to pay more money for a better base. At any rate, if you have the time and patience to build your own bench that would be ideal. For me I needed a functional bench and didn't have the time to make one myself. If I had to do it again, I would probably buy this workbench again. Most likely, when I get the time, I'll make a base myself out of better materials. Hope this helps..."
3,Sjobergs Full-Size Jointer Workbench,"Somewhat disappointed with the value and quality. Originally, the top was shipped without the leg set, but Amazon.com responded in a timely manner with the missing material.The leg set was designed to work with several Sjoberg benches so they were not optimized in terms of fit, form, & function for the full size bench. I believe that this bench is somewhat ""under built"" in terms of mass and sturdiness considering the ... price. Both wood vices are not very robust.In summary, very satisfied with Amazon.com's response in replacing missing parts, but not excited with the quality of the bench"
4,Great mini-album followup.,"You should definetly get Forever first, but if you enjoy synthpop you have to check this out. ""Lazy"" is as pretty as ""Plastic Stars"", and has one of the better choruses to come out of synthpop in quite a while. ""Shark Attack"" is the coolest song anyone's ever written about Wheel of Fortune, and actually has vocals from the Duke of Candied Apples instead of Liz for a change of pace. And it's worth the price of the disc alone for the Lameboy remix of Science Genius Girl that was actually programmed on a hacked gameboy. Delicious..."
2,uhhhhhhhhhhhhh,should ishuld i notwell ive heard good and REALLY BAD but my friend liam is bagering me to get it sooo..........I PROBLEY WONT
3,Okay Read,"Great story line, but there isn't much to say about the story. The beginning was great and then it got really weird and choppy towards the end. Also, I didn't really appreciate all the grammatical mistakes and misspellings throughout the book; the writer sort of loses credibility when he can't even properly proofread his book."
2,"All trees, no forest","A comprehensive description of CD/IL this, that and the other, without any grasp of explaining the big picture of the subject. We're doing a chapter a week as part of my internal medicine residency rounds and it's utter torture. I still don't have a good idea of where we're going with this. My residentmates and instructors agree - we're seriously considering jumping ship and buying another book."
4,Immunology Defind - The Latest Tizard Blizzard,"Concruent with previous layouts, this latest edition is repleat with photos, charts and graphics that aid in one's understanding of the fundamental principles detailed herein. A welcome refresher for the practiced veterinarian, it remains the standard text for graduate and veterinary school students alike."
5,Any Bond fan should have this soundtrack !,"A very good James Bond score with a smashing main title song and a very exciting action theme (i.e. on track 1: ""Snow Job"" and on track 8: ""He's dangerous""). This soundtrack was released as a Japanese import and is therefore a bit more difficult to obtain. But it works !"
5,The Best Bond Soundtrack EVER!,"This is perhaps John Barry's finest James Bond score ever! The track ""Snow Job"" is the best action theme that I have ever heard next to the James Bond Theme which also appears here. Brings back fond memories of when I first became a James Bond fan."
3,Contains the best cues of the film,"I would recommend this CD to those who know and love the music from the film. It is not necessarily for the casual listener. Although it is a bit repetitive with its themes, I am happy that it contains the essential tracks from the film. It is well worth the import price, as it is not currently available domestically."
2,don't expect to get more than 2 y of use out of this,"a clear plastic cover for a license plate is essential some places (like Philadelphia). This fits the bill EXCEPT that it turns yellow, brittle and ugly after a year or two out in the sun. I bought one of these a couple of years ago and just replaced it because it made my plate essentially unreadable (and ugly!).There must be something better."
2,Product description is incorrect; no metal rim or screw covers,"The product description is incorrect. It states:""Slim rim frame set into perimeter frame (includes four screw covers)Made of unbreakable polycarbonatePolycarbonate is UV protectedEach metal frame is carefully hand polished""I ordered two of them and both were shrink wrapped and neither fit the description. Both are entirely clear polycarbonate frames. Neither had the slim rim frame set in perimeter frame nor any hand polished metal rim as described. Nor were any screw covers included. Items are fine and functional, just not what is described. I'm happy with the shield as is and if it was as described would have rated it higher. I called Amazon and they said they would correct the description within a few days. I'll update this if they do and/or after a season with the shields on."
5,for new car,"I bought this in anticipation of getting a new car. I was unable to find anything similar in the local big box stores, so went to Amazon. It came very quickly (didn't even have the car yet) and it is now installed on my new car & looks great. I have a vanity plate and use this to protect the front plate."
4,Amazing multi media equipment,"This is not only a digital camera with multiple lighting/flash/zoom options but also a video recorder, mp3 player, and sound recorder. I take this with me everywhere and everyone always asks me what it is and they are amazed by what all it has to offer. I was wary of purchasing this item at first because I have never heard of the manufacturer but it was the best buy I could find and I am glad I chose this item against other standard digital cameras. It is also a plus that the camera runs on a rechargeable battery. I recomend purchasing a sd memory card along with it, though as the internal memory is not very big. The reason I give it a four and not a five is because of the small internal memory and also that the pixels get to be pretty horrible when zooming in real close."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Do not buy this game unless you want to waste your money. The graphics are extremely bad and it is no fun at all. Though it does have quite a few trucks. When I got mine, I installed it and played it and it was so bad, I didn't even want to have it installed on my computer and take up my hard drive space so now its just sitting in my closet collecting cobwebs. So unless you just want to look at all the trucks all day, don't buy it. Trust me."
3,It's ok,"It's an ok game. Sometimes you get mad and want to throw your computer across the room. The graphics arent to great and its kind of easy. But it does have alot of tracks and cars. If you like off-road racing you could buy this, but I advise you to buy Off-road testing 3."
5,A VERY MOVING MOVIE,Stephen Rea is spot on as the only person convictedof the Lindberg baby kidnapping.I saw this movie many years ago and have periodicallychecked to see if it was available on DVD. No suchluck so far.The story is intriguing throughout and the actors areall exemplary. A rare 5 Star rating by me.
2,Holly needs to get a life,"Dr. Holly ""Incubator"" Fisher is all about one thing: the entirety of her life is wrapped up in her crotch not working. Never mind the fact that she's battled hard to beat a nasty form of cancer. She's highly educated and respected, and she's very intelligent, but all she is capable of doing is whining about she's nothing because she can't propagate her DNA via some imaginary baby.Holly ruined what could have been a fun thriller. She was so lacking in personality and so annoying about her desire to breed, I kept hoping the next attempt on her life would put her out of everyone's misery.Richard, his sister Jessie, Dr. Susan, Otto the Sheriff, they were all great characters. Too bad Holly couldn't pull herself out of her pity parade."
1,Heavy made good,But the sleeves are unusually short. I did finally get my return authorization after 2 weeks & a bad review.
5,John Waite's Best AOR Effort!!,"In my opinion this was John Waite's best AOR effort next to Bad English. He brings on Desmond Child (Bon Jovi), Joe Lynn Turner (Rainbow, Deep Purple) & Diane Warren for his background vocalists. John McCurry (Alice Cooper, Robin Beck, Billy Squier & Kane Roberts) handles the guitar work and John Waite sings his heart out. The songlisting is:1. These Times Are Hard For Lovers2. Act Of Love3. Encircled4. Woman's Touch5. Wild One6. Don't Lose Any Sleep7. Sometimes8. She's The One9. Big Time For LoveIf you don't have this cd get it, you will love it."
4,Waite's Test,"Really this is a test to probe that John is more than ""Missing you"" . For me, this is great. New ballads and a few support of ""Solid gold"" TV Show in that time. For eighties fans, it is very good. ""Act of love"" is great and if you like Bad English you will like this one. Not to much rock but great ballads."
1,Avoid this collection!,"After years of ordering finely remastered vintage rock and R&B reissues from labels like Ace UK, Boulevard Vintage, Bear Family, and Collectables, I was hugely disappointed to find that this Collectables compilation was filled with scratchy, distorted tracks barely worthy of the label's usual reputation. Many cuts sound like a needle was dropped on a worn 45 rpm disk just seconds before the tune begins. There appears to have been no effort to digitally remaster these with high grade audio restoration software. Imagine my surprise when I found many of these same tracks with much better sound quality on a collection called ""Golden Anniversary - Collector's Edition - Lin, Kliff, Big L - 1954-2004"" on the Big L label. I've promptly ordered it. Bear Family Records has a more extensive 4 CD set titled ""The Lin / Kliff Story,"" but you, like me, may not want to shell out the nearly $100.00 it routinely costs."
5,Excellent Book,"I highly recommend this book to those who wants rudimentary Economics knowledge. It is ladened with graphs and basic algebraic equations which made the concepts easier to understand. The author has dispelled my long belief that the subject is ""dull""."
5,Economics for Dummies.....,This book is a good starting point for understanding economics. It's written clearly and with a sense of humour making the subject a little less tedious.
3,An Economics for Everyone,"The book is very good for people who wants to learn about economics. However, it has no chapter review test to test the understanding of the reader."
4,"Easy, clear, not too detailed",Very well-written and clear introduction to economics for people who don't know anything in that subject. I would swap microeconomics and macroeconomics chapters; would also prefer significantly more real-world examples. Would be nice to have a couple chapters for people who know enough math and wish a bit deeper understanding.
4,Course work aid,Worked well in class. Helped in class -- it clearly stated what is understood in the world of economics - and in every day live..
4,Economics for Dummies,"I am/was a real dummy about Economics. Although this book did not cover everything I needed to understand for my Economics course, it was extremely helpful. I got a B which was more than I was expecting. It was hard to find a book written to help in a course rather than tell you how to invest etc. so I was really gerateful to find it. If you are having probl;ems with college Economics, I recommend Economics for Dummies."
5,awesome product!!!,Shipped super fast! im really happy with my purchase would definately recommend and it was extreamely helpful I love this book!!!!
3,Easy Econ Reference book,"I really liked the examples and explanation, but they were for ""beginners"" than ""intermediary"" learners or course takers. It should only be used as a reference book to clarify concepts and nothing more. I wish they had made the content suited more to supplement course , but it is again a self-help book for 'beginners' than intermediary or advanced learners/ course takers. Not recommend it for people taking College Econ courses since most schools are focus on calc than theory."
5,Graceless and Immense - Comfy and Cool,"My garden clogs make my feet look huge, and even with socks I had to order a smaller size. Generally I can count on being an easy 7, but had to buy a 6, and still have quite a bit of room. I use these in the yard, at the pool, riding my bike, shopping and have even been known to accidentally wear them to work. They are more comfy than sneakers, and have wonderful arch supports built in - important for me and a heel spur I have been dealing with for a number of years now. Teenagers seem to think they are cool too, and the navy upper really might pass as leather if you don't look too close. Great with jeans.Happy feet when I'm in my clogs!"
5,Great Keepsake!,I was looking a DVD Keepsake of our 44th President Barack Obama. This was the perfect choice.
5,Give opinions about the ITEM please,"Only two reviews so far on this item, and I note the second has nothing to do with the item itself but is rather someone's big chance to soapbox his negativity about our new President. Speaking as a consumer and someone interested in this item and perhaps buying it, can reviews please focus on the item itself and its quality/presentation, rather than personal opinions re. the subject? Thank you."
2,Harem,"First of all, I'm a die hard SB fan, I owned 17 of her album/EP/musicals. Now get down to business.I'm not very sure what Sarah is trying to lead us this time. This is more of an average pop album than anything else she's good at. I'm not saying that she shouldn't try new things. In fact, songs like ""A Question of Honor"" proves that a new blend can be very promising. But things are not going well in this album.Take ""Harem"" as example, it can be a song of great potential, but the way Sarah sung it gives it all away.BTW, I don't think we need her singing too much pop (not too much operatic vocal either), a balanced mix of all suits her better since she is so so versatile, and certainly can achieve a lot more.Well, if someone is trying to look for an SB commercial hit parade, I'll recommend ""As a came of Age"" over ""Harem"".Sorry for the harsh comments, please understand she can be so much better than this. Alas!"
3,Better Than The Other Two I Watched,"Being a transplant to Kansas, I had heard some talk of the Wichita serial killer. Wichita is over 100 miles from the little Kansas town that I have lived in since 1970 so it was far removed enough from me that I paid little attention to it. However, the day Dennis Rader was apprehended I was a patient in a Wichita hospital and coverage of him and his arrest was all over the TV. I became pretty interested in the case and began to look into it. This movie follows the actual story reasonably well. I was unimpressed with the acting but if you're just wanting to see a story about what really happened, this is the closest-to-the-facts version I have seen. There are two other BTK DVDS available on Amazon, but they are unwatchable. This one isn't all that great, but it does give you an overall idea of what happened."
5,A Must Read!,"The author has a very vivid imagination. You feel like she has ""been there and done that."" The short stories keep your attention and you do not know how they will end. According to my husband the short story about Clifton Forge should be made into a movie."
2,Disappointment,"DVD set was shrink-wrapped, however, cardboard case had been cut through (with some kind of saw?) touching individual plastic cases...I would have liked to have known about this defect prior to purchase."
2,musical itching powder,"Lots of good reviews here but - keep it Mum - this is one of the most irritating records you are likely to hear. Whimsical to a fault, this is a solid attempt to make a certain type of affectation - coy feyness with an `undercurrent' - cool. Alas, it's a tinny, tinkling aural irritant that makes you want to get something solid in your ears because this is just tickling too much. Does it remind me of childhood? Only spinsterish English teachers who wouldn't know Jimi Hendrix from a hole in the ground... Dad! Tell Mum to shut up!"
1,Icelandic hype!,"This album stinks! Very monotonous and predictable. If you want to check out a real indie electronic record, check out Dntel's ""Life Is Full Of Possibilities"". Dntel is a pioneer of this genre, he deserves a lot more attention then MUM, please!"
5,beautifuly happy melancholy,"another beautiful arrangement from iceland, if you enjoy Sigur Ros, then you will likely like this one too, it contains english lyrics as well."
3,good but monotonous,The tracks don't vary much. Needs a bit more to keep me listening to it instead of others in my collection.
4,Should read.,"The story was slow to start and also it doesn't take a genius to know what's brewing. However, this book seems to be a more balanced book in that it gives the reader a glimpse into the minds of the both sides and how they each struggle to manage their expectations, disappointments, forgiveness and love for each other. Author certainly knows how best to tug at the heart strings of readers. Should read."
5,One of my Favorites,"Once in a while there comes a book that will linger in your mind and also in your heart. This is what I found with the characters in The Endearment. The book was funny and it was sad. It pulled at your heartstrings, and to me that is the mark of an excellent writer. I have read almost all of Ms Spencer's work, but this is by far one of my favorites,and is topped only by ""Twice Loved""."
4,It was good,"I have read this book in the past but it merited a re-read. Good book not a lot of your usual ""romance book"" writing. Which made for a better read for me."
3,I get it,I longed for Lavyrle Spencer's intriguing story line in this book. It never arrived for me. After reading for the umpteenth time about harnessing horses and trees I said out loud 'I get it!' I loved her book Years and Then Came Heaven. This one is just too repetitive.
2,Boring....,"I usually really enjoy Lavyrle Spencer books. I found this to be drawn out, hoakey and boring. The characters seemed one dimensional and the love story had no spark. A big nothing for me."
3,The Endearment,This was not one of her best books but was an education in surviving in the wilderness back in the day.
5,"Very, very good","This is one of LaVyrle's best books. She truly is the master of tender love stories. The characters were real, funny and warm. I just loved it."
5,Myrna Des Voigne,It has been many years since I read this book. I was reading the reviews and it sounded so familiar. Then scenes started coming into my mind. Like when Anna went to pick berries and had to climb a tree and then got bitten all over with mosquitos and how tender Karl was when he found her. Then another scene with the bear and Karl coming back and finding the bear skinned by Anna and her brother. I loved this book. I could see where both Anna and Karl were coming from and what and how they had to change to become true lovers and a family. My heart ached for them so many times while reading this. This is definitely a keeper for me. The reviews have made me want to reread the book. Thank you all. I have remembered things over the years from the book but couldn't remember the title or author.
2,Could It Have Been Any More Boring?,"This story moved slower than a slug. Although I ultimately liked the characters and believed their love story, I was Sooooo bored with the telling of it I wanted to put it down but I kept reminding myself that I paid for the thing, so I grudgingly stuck with it. Yawn."
2,Romance-Novel Drivel But Compelling Descriptions of Homesteading In Minnesota,"I found this at a garage sale and took a chance. Quite simply, it is a romance novel - ugh! However, the descriptions of homesteading life in the early 1800's in Minnesota were captivating. It's the only reason I finished the book. Ms Spencer is a gifted writer who obviously does her research, which makes me wonder why in the world she doesn't write more serious novels. The romance story line was trite, boring, and pure romance-novel drivel and had to be suffered through to read the very compelling descriptions of life in the ""wild."" Unfortunately, I will not read another of her books."
2,Misleading,"I just received this product. The cutout in the shade is too large for the bulb and falls over the bulb. The rings do not have any way of going thru the hole above each socket, as they are solid rings. I am wondering if the picture is in error, and the rings should act like washers to hold the fixture, but they are so tight, I can't get them around the base of the fixture. If I can't resolve this, the lights will have to be returned."
5,Forever enchanting Shirley Temple,Shirley Temple - Little Darling Pack (Little Miss Marker/Now and Forever/The Runt Page)Absolutely love these two classic films with Shirley Temple.Michele Cohen
4,Little Darling Pack,"""Little Miss Marker"" typical Shirley and typical Damon Runyan. ""Now and Forever"" is rather atypical as it is not the typical happy ending. I'm not sure it is for young children. The Runt Page is not worth the DVD it was printed. You wonder how they made movies like that. Today they wouldn't be allowed."
2,"Not a good value for a ""Franchise Collection""","First off, this ""set"" only contains two full movies. That alone makes this far less of a value than Universal's many other ""Franchise Collections"", such as those for Abbott & Costello, ""Ma and Pa Kettle"", and ""Francis the Talking Mule"".Secondly, the transfers are very substandard. No effort whatsoever has been made to clean up these films, and the result is a transfer equivalent to a Madacy release.Definitely not one of Universal's better values."
4,Another Rainbow collection?,"Typical of the music business, here's yet another collection of Rainbow tracks. So why would anyone buy this? Because they did the old ""add a rarity unavailable elsewhere else"" trick. The live version of All Night Long included here is from the 1980 Castle Donington/Monsters of Rock show. Previously available on vinyl in the early 80's, it's never appeared on CD before. Except for the version of Since You've Been Gone on Finyl Vinyl, nothing else from this legendary gig is avalable on CD. So why do I rate it 4 stars? Because it's not your typical ""gather up the hits"" collection. It actually gives you the best tracks from nearly every album, most of which is ignored on the other Rainbow single disc compilations. Still, it's mostly for collectors only. People unfamiliar with the band would be better served with one of the other greatest hits discs."
4,Great companion to A Reader's Guide,"This book is a great companion piece to Selden's other book A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory. The theories discussed in A Reader's Guide are here applied to classics of world literature (ex. poems by Wordsworth and Keats). Works of literature are interpreted from the point of view of each of the major theories discussed in A Reader's Guide (New Criticism, Russian Formalism, Structuralism, Poststructuralism, Psychoanalysis, Marxism, Feminism, Post-colonialism, etc.). This will help literature students in writing papers from various critical perspectives."
2,nice plane but handles are too small,This is a nice plane but the rear handle is too small for my hand. That makes it uncomfortable to use. I will try to find a larger handle or it will make a nice gift for a smaller person.
3,Perhaps ahead of it's time,"The concepts in this book, which are plucked from proven success strategies in the business world, can be quite helpful if a family is structured in a way that is condusive to a process which requires disciplined structure. My research indicates that the majority of families have precious little time to complete the tasks that our current culture demands, and adding a system for family flow (though in theory is fantastic!) does not rate high on the priority list.I would suggest that this book will become more and more pertinent as we evolve and recognize just how beneficial this type of feedback and communication is for families and mankind at large.Kudos to the authors for their visionary work."
4,"Pioneer 3"" x 5"", 300 Pocket Album Review","I like the albums, however the Post binding screws are VERY hard to get out. I almost returned the item because I thought the screws were defective and wouldn't budge. But then I put some muscle into it and torqued the screwdriver and the screw FINALLY came out. I like the pockets and the 3 x 5 size of the album so I was determined to overcome the difficult screw issue.Pioneer Memo Pocket Album"
4,tribe fans should get this,"If you are a big Tribe fan, then this CD is definitely a must have. I was somewhat disappointed in this CD, but overall it was pretty phat and was worth the money. You should check out the Bonita Applebum and Check the Rhime remixes, each of which are really good. And you've probably heard the Young Nation Mix of Scenario, which is also pretty tight. Everything else sounds like something Tribe wouldn't have done, but still they are pretty good cuts."
4,Best albums for lots of pics,"I have 5 of these albums, one for each kid and one for us. I love how many pics they hold. I did get some the last time that had a few pages where the glue quality made it hard to fit some pics in. I keep lots of pics and this way I don't need many albums. Now, if only the price of refills would come down. It almost makes more sense to buy another album and just keep the pages."
2,All the pages are wrinkled,"I purchased this album because I take a lot of pictures. When I received it; I opened it, and all the pages were wrinkled. Why am I going to put nice looking pictures in wrinkled pages. I sure wish that pioneer would have done their homework on this one. I won't buy another one."
1,The guy in Shipping is either illiterate or colorblind!,"I always use the MP-46 Pioneer albums. They are the best photo albums EVER!! I placed an order through Amazon to this company (Adorama). I ordered a WHITE album for wedding pictures. The receipt stated that I ordered a white album. I received a RED photo album.In my disappointment, I emailed Adorama to let them know (this is the only way to contact Customer Service). But instead of returning the red photo album, I decided that since I use these albums anyway, I would just save it and use it for other pictures.I made a second order for a WHITE photo album for the wedding pictures. I received a GREEN photo album!!!!!!!So, if you really don't care what color you get, go ahead and order from this company, but if you have a particular color in mind, you would be better off going to another online company."
5,geat,great lovet zzz z zzzzzz zzzzcczcccccz zzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz czzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzz z zzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzz z
5,"A solid, impressive photo album","This Pioneer photo album provides an impressive display for your 4x6"" photos. I now own 6 of these albums, and I've never seen anything else that compares. The post-style page mounting allows the albums to be expanded (inserts available here at Amazon). Two of my favorite albums are now almost 2 inches thick. These become good-looking, impressive ambums for showing off to family and friends. The wide pages really make your picture displays look good, and the gold embossed back bindings make the albums look great in your personal library. If you're proud of your photos, this is the album to own."
1,Defective; Pockets Too Small,"I bought two of these albums. When they first arrived, wewere thrilled. But soon found out that 2 or 3 of the 6photo pockets on each page were too small! Our 4x6 photosmeasured either 5 7/8 inches or 5 15/16 inches in width,so there was no problem with the prints. Pioneer evidentlyhas no quality control, and they have no customer service,or any apparent interest in their customer's concerns.A nice concept, but the execution is problematic. Buy atyour own risk."
2,Gets the job done,"This is a good basic photo album. Each picture fits in a pocket and you can write short notes about each picture. I like that the pages and pockets are acid free, archive quality. I got these albums mainly because it turns out that you cannot expand an album forever with refill pages. The cheap cardboard cover breaks after a time. One refill may be possile."
2,"Plane is OK, but not the blade","The edge of the blade is not at 90 degree, the deviation is enormous and can be seen by eye, something like 1 mm difference if measured along the sides. I think this confirms the absence of any quality outsorting noticed by other reviewers."
3,A little disappointed with the finish quality!,I elected to purchase the contractor grade version thinking it would be of a better build quality overall. It does the job well enough but I was disappointed with the overall finish of the plane!
4,fairy tale fun,"I watched these shows years ago, and was happy to find them on DVD. I would split these shows into two catagories those for adults, and those for children. There are some adult themes in The Frog Prince that I didn't care for. I also didn't like hearing the word d@mn in it. I would also say that Sleeping Beauty has some offensive themes as well. My childrens favorites vary. My oldest likes The Boy Who Left Home To Find Out About The Shivers, and The Princess And The Pea. My youngest likes The Dancing Princesses, and my favorites are Cinderella and Snow White. The stories are cute, and most add humor. Some are more for adults while there are still several younger children will enjoy. Parents should watch them first, and then decide which can be watched by their children."
5,classically entertaining!,"I enjoyed watching this classics with my three daughters when they were young. I now enjoy seeing them again with my three grandsons, they never go out of style."
4,great for grandparents to have on hand.,"These are the classical faerie tales that we all read as children portrayed in lucious sets with great costumes and excellent actors. I enjoy watching the series because I like seeing some of the currently famous movie stars from an era when they were not as well known. I also appreciate that these are not animated tales or ""cartoons"" but use real actors. My grandchildren are mesmerized by each tale as they have never been exposed to these stories in this format. Therefore, when we need a quiet moment, picking a new story to watch is a real treat."
5,From Generation to Generation...,"I enjoyed this series so much, that when I saw it on DVD, I just had to have it to share with my daughter. I have always been impressed with the care and labor of love put into bringing these timeless tales to life. With each viewing my respect for those instrumental in bringing the Faerie Tale Theatre Series to us has grown to new heights.I look forward to enjoying the experience with my daughter and continuing the tradition from generation to generation."
3,Love the show but disappointed in image quality,"This is one of my favorite shows and I'm very thankful to have it on DVD. The packaging for this edition is good and definitely an improvement on the previous edition with a gold cover, in which 6 discs were stacked on a plastic spindle and the last disc was defective (the second side would not play). However, I was disappointed with the image quality of the episodes in this edition. They appear fuzzier and less crisp than on the previous edition. The difference is perhaps unnoticeable to many, but I found it distracting. I have actually just gone ahead and moved the discs from the previous edition into this packaging because I prefer the image quality of the previous set. However, since that set is now out of print, it looks like this will be the only available option for most buyers. Make no mistake, this edition is watchable, and it's better than nothing, but I prefer the previous edition and was disappointed with this supposed ""upgrade."""
4,Faerie Tale Theatre,"Gave this as a gift, and the receipient was thrilled. We watched some of the tales and laughed at the new version of old stories. Great, well-known actors and actresses throughout the set. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the recipient's children were not as happy with it as we adults were--I don't think they got the irony of it."
3,Faerie Tale Theatre Review,"Although the staging and costuming in the CDs are good, I believe the productions could be too talky for young children."
4,great movie,This was a great collection of faerie tales. The book was great as well because it explained each faerie tale.
5,Very Excited!,"I am highly excited today! I was so excited when I finally found Faerie Tale Theatre that I took a punt and brought it in region 1... even though I need region 4!I received it today, very speedy delivery also I must add, and to my absolute suprise it works in my dvd player! Looks like ill be having a weekend in!"
5,Fairie Tale Theatre,My daughter started watching Fairie Tale theatre when she was a little girl and although I have all the stories on VHS I wanted to give the DVD to my grandson for his birthday.I've always loved the imagination and joy that has gone into this series. I can't wait to watch the next generation watch this DVD.
4,Pleased with purchase,"Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. It's a nice boxed-set with the full collection of episodes, storybook, and card game. One of the dvd's skips quite a bit and we were unable to finish watching Little Red Riding Hood because it skipped the entire ending. I decided not to return it because I did get a lot for the price, but mainly because I just didn't want to mess with it."
4,This is it,"This is the one you want.It is the complete collection with the (now) stars when they were young.The only negative is that they were put on DVD from the original VCR tapes, so a long way from HD resolution.Classics"
5,Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collection,"This lovely collection comes with all the movies, bonus videos, storybook and a pack of cards with a 3 in 1 feature (meaning that one can play a regular card game, a trivia game based on the movies or a matching game. This is a good buy for those who are enamored by faerie tales and it makes a great gift also."
5,Much better than youtube,My girlfriend/fiance watched this as a child. We were over at her friend's place and it was somehow brought up in conversation and then on TV via youtube which had poor picture and sound quality. The DVD is 100% better and well worth the price. She was very happy too since I gave it to her as a Valentine's present. I guess it brings back childhood memories for her.
5,Sums up my childhood,"When I was a kid (the 90s), we checked out VHS tapes of Faerie Tale Theatre from our local library on a near constant rotation. My sister and I decided on a whim to look on YouTube for episodes and found a few of our favorites. But it's hard to start watching Faerie Tale Theatre without wanting more! I soon searched Amazon and found the complete box set. We love it! While some episodes are better than others, they are each laughable and enjoyable. Who can resist the (completely unrealistic) simplicity of the stories, low-budget scenery and special guest actors? Faerie Tale Theatre can be enjoyed by young and old (especially if you enjoyed it when you were young). We watch it to relive our childhood days and have even got new friends hooked on it! It's funny how much one can remember about movies watched long ago. Faerie Tale Theatre is THE low budget classic in my book."
5,Shelly Duval's Faerie Tale Theatre is the best,I was only 5 the first time I watched these; now I laugh as I see the adult themes when I enjoy them with my son. They're a treat on a rainy day or hectic evening now and again.The product arrived very quickly as promised!
3,Greetings from the Brothers Grimm,The collection contains 26 different interpretations of classic fairy tales on 7 DVDs. Each story is under an hour long with well known actors and actresses from the early eighties.
5,Remembering my childhood,"As all the other reviewers describe, it is a great set of dvds. Remembering Shelley's Faerie Tales was really nostalgic and funny. I do recommend this item. The only problem is that there are no subtitles and the audio, obviously, is not surround 5.1, just 2.0. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this set. Thanks to the other reviewers for their comments, they helped me a lot, and so I wish to help you."
1,What a disappointment,"I can't believe that this series got released AGAIN on DVD without the closed caption tracks from the VHS and original broadcast. Does it really cost that much more to include the CC? It's not like they have to create it from scratch. It had already been done. My wife dearly loves these episodes, but her deafness prevents her from getting the full enjoyment out of them without closed caption. We bought the previous set from Starmaker only to be let down by the lack of CC. We had really hoped that Koch Vision would step up and release this new set with the captions intact. I believe it's a law now that all tv's manufactured for sale in the USA have to have the CC decoder built in. Why can't the media have the same specifications?"
5,The most spectacular set in the world,In all the years of my life i have never experianced such enchantment this set is a remarkable piece of history
5,Awrsome,It was just like I remembered it. I would catch myself smiling through all the episodes! Definaly a great purchase.
4,little kids like Faerie Tale Theatre very much,"We thought Fairie Tale Theatre might be something good to watch with out grandchildren. Of course, my wife and I liked it. We were surprised the two five-year-old grandchildren were totally fascinated by it.The video on the dvds, however, is of suprisingly low quality. It looks like a poorly preserved videocassette."
4,Faerie Tale Theatre,"A step back in time with a lot of upper end humor I didn't catch the frist time around. Well done, Shelley Duvall."
3,Fairie tale theater just ok,The movies are just as I remember them. Picture is fair but the sound quality is awful!
3,Don't Get This Set - Get The Box Set!,"Instead of buying this Collection of 26 DVD's, buy the box set collection for half the price.... Its has all the episodes (I think on 4 discs). You'll save space and money.If you have never heard of this series before, if you love fairy tales, they are the best! There's plenty of big name stars (like Robin Williams and Susan Sarandon). These tales are full of laughs and romance, I would beg for these everytime we went to the video store when I was a kid. I can't wait to share these with my nephews and niece! They are not big budget, but looks similar to watching a play, which adds to the charm."
4,"Great product, bad case","I was so happy to recieve this dvd set. I chose it over the earlier released set with some double sided dvd's because I though they would more easily get scratched. It was probably the correct choice for me, however, this set comes with all the dvd's on one ""spindle"" all one on top of the other. I don't feel comfortable with this set up, so I put them all in their own seperate cases."
4,Memories...sometimes better left as memories!,"I purchased this set while fondly remembering scenes of these shows from my childhood. While a majority of the story lines are boring, some of the CDs are entertaining to watch as an adult. Don't get me wrong, I love the set, but just be prepared to sift through and find the episodes that you can enjoy. I do plan on having my children watch them with me when I have kids :)"
3,Not Sure about it yet. . . . . .,"My sister and I loved watching these episodes when we were kids. I was so excited when I found them all in this complete collection. We put in the first one and were shocked at the language and improper lines. We don't remember that being in there because if it had been, there would have been NO WAY our mom would have let us watch it. We stopped that one and watched the 2nd and 3rd episode on the Disc 1 and there was no language; they were ok. So far so good. If there is anything else improper we will try to return it."
4,great collection but not as good as the cannon movie tales and the disney versions,I just ordered this collection and can't wait to own it. I remember watching these as a kid and really enjoyed them. But later in life i discoverwed the cannon movie tales which are better and even better than that are the disney versions. I highly recomend this collection to lovers of fairytales. Butyou should check out the cannon movie tales and the disney versions first
3,Faerie Tale Theatre,"I was thrilled to discover this collection on DVD! My daughters have fond memories of watching them as they grew up (they're now 22 & 20). Sadly though there was no closed captioning for the hearing impaired and the accompanying book, although filled with lots of information, is not arranged in the same order as the DVDs. Otherwise a delightful addition to any DVD library whose patrons enjoy fairy tales!"
1,Not for children,We were enormously disappointed in this. We bought it largely for our grandchildren (ages 4-12)--afterShelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collectionall this is a collection of fairy tales! In the two we watched the salacious content made them totally inappropriate for children. Example: Christopher Reeve biting off the sequins from Bernadette Peters bodice as she attempts to seduce him in Sleeping Beauty. In expanding the fairy tales into longer stories they became tedious. Despite the casts eminence much of the acting was poor. The programs were done live and seemed to be under-rehearsed and badly produced (e.g. cheap sets). The only good thing about our purchase was that when we returned it--with our complaints--Amazon gave us our money back.
1,very disappointed,"I was very much looking forward to receiving this and eagerly put it in the DVD player. I enjoy fairy tales, but what a disappointment! The delivery of the lines by well known actors is so annoying. Perhaps very young children like it, but I am surprised if older children and adults like that stilted, fake delivery. The packaging is nice, the picture quality is good, and the costumes are nice, but I cannot stand watching it."
1,"Stale jokes, sexual innuendo",Here's a pretty good example of where American culture went off the tracks. These feebly modernized retellings are an insult to the original stories. I'd much rather my daughter read and reread the originals than gain the dubious advantage of watching Robin Williams share sexual innuendo with Teri Garr. Why would you want to have your child spend time watching hour after hour of this stuff instead of developing excellent reading skills? This is not a frivolous question considering that American kids have the worst reading skills in the developed world.
2,A Mom,"Disappointed. Are they trying to make the show funny or what? Just that, the stories are just not how they should be."
4,I Can't Wait!,"My mom just ordered the collection for me yesterday as an early Easter gift. I can't wait to get it! I am 17 years old and I remember renting the tapes from the video store 12 or 13 years ago. I wanted to watch them again but I couldn't find them anywhere. I can't wait to watch my favorite one of the series, Snow White and be scared and laugh all over again. It's just too bad they didn't include any special features on the discs. They should be coming in about 4 days!"
5,Better Than I Could Hope For!,"When I was little, I used to watch Faerie Tale Theatre all the time, and I recently realized that I would probably still enjoy watching it. So, I decided to buy this DVD set, and it was worth it! Eventhough I am now older, I still enjoy these episodes because there is some adult humor thrown in with the childish fun. I definitely recommend this set to anyone!"
3,very dark and grainy,"Each story was more like an odd skit featuring various well known actors/actresses when they were younger or starting out. A curious collection for someone interested in these types of movies. Quality is very poor... Most were very dark and grainy, so difficult to watch. One of the CDs glitches or skipped a little."
3,Sunsei Solar Vent,Works ok. Fair construction. Not as nice as a Nicro vent. Inside trim ring is too large and bulky. It also makes lining up the screws a bit more of a hassle.
4,Good and not so annoying!,"This CD is good. My son really enjoys the songs (especially Under the Sea) and it's not so annoying for me! In fact, there are some songs that I like too! Definitely a much better option than Kidz Bop (SO ANNOYING)."
3,Disney Mania,"The CD came in a timely manner, bur wasn't what I was expecting. Yhe music is more for teens than tots."
4,Best disney mania cd ever.,"I loved some of the song's on this album like colors of thewind by christy charlson ramono she is a brutiful singer andalso a really good roll model.i wont say im in love bythe cheetah girls i loved that song it was very cool.under thesea by raven, i hated the jamaican remix that didnt sound right."
4,Cute,"My neice forced me to listen to this in the car. I swear!! Anyway, it's quite cute. It's got older and newer songs on it, and each are done in a cool and unique way. Clay Aiken, The Cheetah Girls etc etc, I can see how younger kids will like this. I guess adults would love it too if teenyboppers weren't performing, but the music is funky and fun to drive to. The only jib I can poke at this, is that it's great for the kids, so they want to hear it over and over again, and you can tire of this easily. Good songs to sing to though."
2,This is ridiculous,"Firstly, why do they keep redoing the same songs? They should at least ruin other ones. Also, Lalaine has no talent. Neither does Hilary Duff. I really think Disney should try to get some artists with real talent and not a ""big name."" And why do all Disney Channel actresses sing? If you look through things, every blasted one sings something. It is ridiculous. Does anyone remember the good old days when singers had talent, were sponsered by Disney as only singer, and actresses were just actresses and nothing else?"
3,ergonomics arent everything,the mouse has a great feel. i was planning on upgrading from the wired version of this mouse the Ci20 because i loved the feel. im just having absolutely no luck with getting a ramge over 3 feet. and thats with the wireless pointed right in the mouses direction. i wouldnt reccomend it to anyone who wants rage.
2,Not that great,"It's a lot bigger than most of the newer wireless ones, if I'd known that I wouldn't have purchased it. Also, it doesn't have an ""off"" switch, so although it does go into sleep mode, there's no way to turn it off to extend battery life. It takes about 5 seconds to find the connection after it and the computer have been in sleep mode. It's okay, but there are better and faster ones available."
4,"Kensington wireless mouse, Model 72258","This mouse is the best Kensington mouse I have had to date. It has a good feel to it and works very well. It does have one problem. If my Mac is in it's sleep mode, for some reason, it wakes it from the sleep mode, unless I unplug the receiver from the USB socket. I have no idea why and don't enjoy plugging and unplugging. Aside from that it's a great mouse, but for this reason I can only give it 4 stars."
4,Great Mouse for the Price,Very Inexpensive. Very Functional and Practical.This is the best mouse for the price that I've ever seen.
1,what did kensington do,i dont believe this i bought this cause i didnt have a problem with the other kensington mouses i have bought in the past but this was my nightmare it just doesnt work period i think it might be the solid plastic usb plug cause the logitech usb plug is clear if ur deprate for a wireless mouse do not go any where near this one ever
2,Jittery - moves too fast,"I bought this mouse because it was a bit larger than the average. I don't know about you, but if the mouse is too small, I get a hand cramp. The feel of the mouse is really good.On the functional side, it works OK if you turn the sensitivity down on the control panel, but becomes quite annoying when I undock my laptop and want to use the touch pad - I have to reset the sensitivity again and again and again!Not Kensington's best work if you asked me. If you use this with a desktop, it will be just fine. I would not recommend use with a laptop. I am considering returning this one."
4,Works well.,"The buttons are able to be set to do whatever task you want, from turning up or down the volume to inserting your signature on emails or letters. I'm a little bummed that I can't use ALT+whatever for button-keystroke reprogramming. But you can do Shift or Tab+key. It's not as smooth as a wired mouse, so for that I would recommend a laser mouse, but for the price this is a good mouse."
2,I really wouldn't reccomend,"The mouse has a cool feature that let's you know when your batteries are getting low. The little light on the mouse and the light on the receiver turns red. The main problem is that you will see it often. The mouse really goes through batteries. At least the one that I have. One other issue is that when it goes to sleep, you need to click to wake it up. And if your pointer is on something clickable, it gets clicked. Not a huge issue, but can be annoying."
3,A must have for the Riverfenix/Fenix*TX completist,"The live versions of Threesome and A Song For Everyone from the Astoria (London, 2002) are great, high energy, but sound a bit muddy (Purple Reign has much better sound quality). The video quality is very good. This is a UK release."
5,GREAT GREAT STORY,"Great Book!! Great Story!! Great Characters!! Great Author!! This book kept me in a total trance the whole time I was reading. I could not put it down from the beginning of the first chapter to the final page. And of course, the final page left me wanting for more. Sure hope that there is more to come very soon!!!"
5,Enticing Tale That Brings the Characters Into Your Heart,"If you seek a read that brings the characters to life and makes you want to be involved...look no further. Stephanie Weeks has a way with words without trying...its as if you're experiencing,not reading. Be prepared to stamp your name in this book...everyone will want to borrow it, no one will want to return it."
5,Great product!,"I bought this product for my 1 yr old son, who developed a rash from a tag-less Gerber shirt. In just two days, his skin is already healing and is smooth again. I tried Cortisone for one day and it made his rash worse. I paid $9.49 for the same product at the vitamin shoppe, so $6.68 is a great price."
1,Not effective,"I have eczema and was excited about this product since it claims to be a natural alternative to steroid creams and has gotten some good reviews.Unfortunately, the cream did absolutely nothing to reduce the redness, dryness or itchiness of my eczema."
1,didnt work,I was hoping that this would work for my eczema/sebboric dermatitis but it didnt.It didnt provide any relief and actually my skin seemed to flake more. I wouldntrecommend it to any one and to waste your money on such a small amount as well.The directions said to apply it at least 3 times a day. I was using it 2 a day.Maybe thats why.
1,Causes allergic reactions,"Eczema is also called, nonspecific skin dermatitis, and is believed to be associated with people who have allergies. Allergic reaction to certain chemicals, can cause eczema. The active ingredient in this product is a vine, a plant extract, and who knows what the other ingredients are, they are not listed. If your like me and have eczema and or allergies? I would not recommend this product, it gave me an allergic skin reaction, contact dermatitis, everywhere it was applied. It also caused itching for me, this product is not for sensitive skin. This is also not a replacement to cortisone cream as it is not an immuno-suppresent like hyrdorcortisone is. Don't waste your money and make your problem worse by buying this product."
2,Not a true E,"If you need a truly wide shoe, E or EE, this one won't come close. I bought my usual size, 9.5 E, but found the shoe too long and too narrow. Where can I find a true E or a narrow EE? Ah, Me, the rigors of wide feet! Hard to rate because of the width discrepancy, but appears to be well made. Let's hope that it's an easy return."
2,Narrow is too narrow,"I was really excited to find a narrow shoe that wasn't totally ugly. Unfortunately, these narrow shows are REALLY narrow. Also, more pointed than I thought they would be, had to send them back. To be fair, the cushioning seems really nice."
4,Lovely shoe and so soft.,Found it in my size which is unusual. Very soft so far. Should be a good shoe for winter weather.
5,Great book!,"My husband and I started going through this book before we got engaged and finished it while engaged. What an excellent piece of pre-marital counseling material! It dealt with a lot of questions I never would've thought to discuss (ie. Do you hold any bitterness toward anyone?) that are really significant in the long run because they reveal someone's character in an indirect way. I've since given the book to friends who were struggling with whether to pursue engagement or not, and like us, they found that the book stimulated good and deep conversation."
5,Very informational!,"We are thinking of getting married in the future. Both of us are divorced.... and both of us want to be sure of what we are doing and want to in to the marriage ""with our eyes wide open""...this book is invaluable! We are learning things about each other...... and about ourselves!"
3,so far so good,"i'm not engaged nor thinking of getting engaged anytime soon until we are ready but the book is not a bad read at all, there are alot of questons that make you really think, and discuss things with your spouse. i have yet to finish it because i want to finish it together"
5,Enlightening Read,"Wow, wow, wow! Such an eye opener... I wish I read it eight years ago, as it so articulates the truth!"
5,Preparing for Forever...,"Know all those questions that lurk around in the back of your mind? The ones you would like to know your partners thoughts on but you don't want to be the one to ask the question... Get the book - read it together! :) What better way to spend quality time?! What better way to approach those tricky questions? All these topics will come up in a relationship at some point, so why not share them together now and be prepared for the day when they do happen?! Protect your marriage, be prepared for the unexpected...be ready to walk hand-in-hand forever thru any situation."
3,Beware of a religious viewpoint,"This book is just okay. Be aware that it does come from a religious viewpoint, if I would have known that I would not have purchased the book. Some people may appreciate this, but it is just not for me. Niether my fiance or I are religious, so we felt slightly ridiculous reading the questions to each other."
2,COMPLETED WORKBOOK,"I would not have sold this book as ""acceptable"" if the first 35 pages had answers to the questions already completed! I think that you should definitely reevaluate how you're rating this books or at least put a disclaimer. When I paid $4 for this book (which is already small and thin and paperback) I would have expected maybe underlines/highlights and just wear and tear. But if it has the names and personal situations of people already in it...I would have probably not tried to sell it at ALL!"
3,cheuatian,I was looking for something more exciting and unique. This is a great book but not what I wanted. It is too christian for me.
5,Great Conversation Starter,"My fiancee and I went through all 101 questions before getting engaged, and it really helped. We are both in our mid 20's, finishing up graduate school, and have been dating 1 year. We spent around 5-10 minutes answering the simpler questions, and 30 minutes+ for the more sensitive/complex questions.Prior to reading this book, we had discussed many topics such as conflict resolution, attitudes toward financial issues, and typical pre-wedding talk. However, this book asked in-depth questions we had either glossed over or simply had not addressed yet. I'd recommend this book to anyone serious about engagement/marriage and want to go into that next phase of life with better knowledge of his/her partner. Yes, you can have a successful marriage without reading this book, but this book will only help by bringing up topics that should be discussed (kids, money, communications, in-laws, etc) before making a life-long commitment."
4,Good discussion starters,"This book was shared by a couple considering engagement. Both said the questions were helpful and thought provoking, although simple enough to do 10 questions at a sitting.They both felt this was an excellent ""Book One"" in premarital discussions, and would like to see a more in-depth follow-up that has more scripture and deeper discussion and how-to guides on major issues such as finances, children, and spiritual growth and leadership."
5,Great book for couples,"My husband and I used this book before we got engaged. It makes you talk about difficult issues as well as not so difficult ones. If you answer these questions honestly, it can help you get to know the person you're dating to figure out if you want to get married. One thing about it is that answering each question can take time, so with 101 questions, going through the entire book can be time consuming. My husband and I like to go back to the book to read our answers."
3,"Not too helpful for me right now, but did have some good questions.","This book was interesting but I felt that I was not the target audience. The writer focused on an older demographic. A lot of questions were for people who have lots of experience or who are already divorced and marrying again. I'm in my twenties so I was focusing on knowing who is right the first time around. Regardless, there were a few questions that I hadn't considered asking my boyfriend, and so it did start some open conversations. But overall, I don't think I would have bought this again if I had browsed through the content at the store."
3,"Good, but...",A lot of the questions were good but I found the overwhelming Christian bias distracting. It should at least start some meaningful conversations with my boyfriend though.
3,pretty religious,"there's some good questions in here, but there's also a lot of really christian questions. that's not a bad thing, but my fiance and i already are on strong-footing, religion-wise. i was hoping for more 'non-religious' good questions."
1,not worth the money,"cheap. rips easy. not bindley well. hard to get photos in. they did ship fast, which was nice. not sure if company is making them like they use to?"
1,WIsh there were more choices out there :(,"I have a small office with 4 staff and we had the tenant improvments done just 18 months ago and needless to say, the toilet seat snapped right in half on one of the arms tonight without any pressure. I don't think I have ever seen a toilet seat break like that. They obviously use a cheap plastic when molding them. I would not recomment this seat although it is the only one I have been able to find to replace it with unfortunately."
4,I like the price and quality,good price and good quality. I have this for more than 1 wk. It looks nice and neat.
5,Quantitative Evaluation,Audio Merits:8/10; Video Merits:8/10; Cinematographic Merits:8/10; Musical Merits:10/10;Overall Artistic Performance:10/10;DVD Extras:10/10;Recording Total Quality:9/10. Professor's Recommendation: Unique reference including Dvorak scores on DVD medium.
5,"Wonderful, Fantastic Book",I totally enjoyed reading this book and appreciate so much the time they took to share their lives with the world. I've been telling everyone to read this book and I thank the person so very much who recommended it to me while I was vacationing in Florida.
2,Friends: A Love Story,"I bought this book after seeing the couple on the Oprah show. I thought this must be a great book to read. Needless to say, it is somewhat interesting if you can get beyond Angela's use of four letter words. People need to consider those reading their books before they write them. I am sure she would not want her mother reading it with her filthy mouth. On the other hand, reading Courtney's chapters, I found none of those words. I have a different opinion of Angela. A lady does not use words like that to get her point across. Some things you need to leave to a person's imagination. Then again, I should not have been disappointed when I heard Angela say that Courtney waited until they were married to actually consumate the marriage, but she tried to entice him. I wanted my daughter to read the book to encourage her and to see when a ""real"" man loves you. Hopefully her chapters will get better, if not, perhaps I will black out the four letter words."
3,Angela and Courtney,"A journey to love that readers familiar with this Hollywood couple will likely enjoy. The couple takes turns narrating their lives from childhood to adulthood - from college at Yale to the New York theatre to the Los Angeles Hollywood scene. We read about their romantic relationships. We read about addictions and issues with their parents. We read about their own struggle to become parents. The book wraps with Angela and Courtney's views/tips on becoming a better you/strengthening and maintaining your relationships. Readers are sure to come away from this with a greater respect for this couple's views on life and love.*NOTE: There are WAY too many typos in this book. Would I buy it? Hmmm, nah - not something I'd want to read again."
4,Engaging,"I'm not completely done this book. Bought it because I heard Angela Bassett and Courtney Vance speak on Oprah. The writing isn't very good, but I am enjoying very much hearing about their individual lives leading up to the point where they become interested in each other. I have started many books in 2007, but this is one I haven't been able to put down and will definitely finish!"
5,Just Wonderful,This Book was just Wonderful.The first book in a long time that I couldn't put down!!
4,Good Book,"This is a pretty good book. I normally don't read relationship/biography types of books, but it was recommended to me by a friend. I must say, I have unexpectedly learned a good deal; from the mechanics of acting and what actors go through, to understanding the qualities of a good partner."
2,Best for Beginners,"I thought the 2nd edition would be more high level, as well as include RFP templates etc. However, the book is still very basic and really only appropriate for those with little to no knowledge of web site development and promotion. That should be made clearer in the desciption."
1,For entry-level marketers,This book may have some potential for a marketer fresh out of college but it will seem simplistic for the veteran marketer.
1,"Lots of blah, blah","I was very disappointed in this book. It helped me very little when working on our iMarket Plan. There is a lot of text, but very little concrete, substantive information."
2,cheaply made,"I purchased the leaf cart to replace a metal one I had gotten years ago they no longer make. The first thing I did not like on it was the wheels were too small and being plastic made them not very smooth to roll down the driveway. The first day I used it, it tipped over several times as I was trying to place leaves in it. Then within hrs. one of the 4 plastic insert pieces that holds the lid in broke. I was rather dissappointed to say the least."
5,Just whatI was looking for,Th product is just what I was looking for! The only suggestion is to make the top frame larger so that it is easier to empty a grass catcher into it.It was delivered on time and in good condition. Easy to put together.
1,Cart without Clips,"I replaced my previous cart (no longer available) with this Poly Lawn and Leaf Cart and I have been so disappointed, I lost all the clips due to the fact that the clips cannot withstand the weight of the items in the bag. Never even installed the flap that covers the bag because I didn't want to have to lift the flap every time I was placing leaves in the bag. What a terrible design, not functional. Too bad they don't make my previous cart."
2,Not very sturdy,"Product is not as substantial as it appears in the photograph. It is really very flimsy and much smaller than it appears. It has a metal frame that the plastic parts snap onto. The plastic clips that hold the bag to the rim will unsnap and fall into the bag. The opening to put debris is small.I guess it would be fine for little ladies to put clippings after trimming their flowers, but for raking leaves and pinestraw, one would be wise to pass on this one. It also would be impossible to empty a lawn mower bag into."
2,Not what I expected,"Was very disapointed with this Ames cart. I had one about 10 years ago and it was great. Like so many other companys over the years they make it cheaper. I hate the black clips that hold the bag on, Ive lost several already. Use to be a nice thick black band that held the bag in place. Although this works better than nothing I will never buy another one. I will just get a cheap one. What a shame this use to be a good company with quality products."
5,magic from the mountain,"This is simply a beautifully integrated and sustained collection of pieces, which meld effortlessly into one another. Lloyd is at his most honeyed and reflective from the restrained opening to 'Requiem', and the other members of the quartet, Stenson on piano, Jormin on bass, and Peterson on drums, pick up their cue to deliver a gloriously rich set of gently emotive pieces, with each solo lifting and re-working the theme with respect and warmth, and sublime musicianship. The rhapsodically meditative quality of this very fine album only gives way briefly 'When Miss Jessye Sings', when Lloyd and the band open out in a questing, exploratory way, but 'Pilgrimage to the Mountain: Surrender' eases us gently back down, in an overall performance suffused with grace. Essential listening."
4,Great For Your Summer Reading List,"Content: A memoir sharing the author's unbelievably sad childhood, yet some of her memories are touching and sweet....even comical.Writing Style: This is an easy, quick read. Interesting to read from her point of view as a child. Some phrases were overused, which I found to be ineffective and a little annoying.For conservatives: The F-word is used quite a bit, but you can understand why she'd be angry enough to use it."
5,A Must Read/Wont be Able to Put Down/Got to Get,"This is a beautiful book which tells a heart-wrenching story. I could not put the book down, and had to stop myself from skipping paragraphs to find out what happened next.I was initially hesitant to read this book, as it seems to be marketed in teen publications. However, as an adult who is an avid reader, I can verify that this is not just a book for teenagers. I was deeply moved."
2,Blackbird:A Childhood Lost and Found,"The story was well written, however I would never recommend Blackbird: A Childhood Lost andFound to anyone because of the many times vulgar language was used throughout the story.I would think more non explicit language could and sould have been used."
5,One of the best books ever...,The way the story is told is amazing. Such beautiful writting. I don't ever remember getting so emotional from reading a book.
2,Too many details unaddressed,I was eager to read this book once I found out about it and read the entire thing in one sitting. While the story is very sad the ending was disappointing. I was left with many questions unanswered and extremely underwhelmed.
5,Blackbird: A Childhood Lost and Found,"After reading the book, I had to read the acknowledgement page again to see if this story was really true. It is an amazing story. I felt angry through most of the book--angry that parents could be so ignorant and angry that people could be so cruel. The book made me aware of all the situations we are unaware of when dealing with children. Lauck did a wonderful job of relating the story as a child would. It must have been terribly painful for her to travel through those days again."
1,Oh please - no more Snow White.,"While Jennifer Lauck's personal strength is to be commended, Blackbird lacks both a true adult perspective and a believable child's memory of her experiences. We are taken through a long journey of loss and a description of a child's stoicism in the face of cruelty and arbitrary actions on the part of her ""evil step mother"". That she repeats the Snow White theme as well as her particular sensations when she senses something is wrong - over and over agin - becomes tiresome. The only reason I finished it was to discuss it in my bookgroup - even this would not have been motivation enough had I not been new to the group."
1,Bad book club selection. No insiration,"Kept hoping this book would evolve into some sort of ""parable,"" where reader could learn something to apply to own life."
1,a poorly written memoir,"The writing style was meant to sound like a child had written it I suppose but it was so stilted and static that it was painful to read. Mary Karr and Jeannette Walls have written moving, beautifully written accounts of their difficult childhoods, but this one falls flat. Because of the poor writing I was unable to finish the book or care about any of the characters, not one of whom was well developed or came alive on the page."
3,Blackbird: A Childhood Lost and Found,"This was truly a sad story about a young girl and the terrible life that she was subjected to. Though I found the story interesting, I was disappointed with the abrubt ending to the story. I am not sure if the author is planning on a sequel, but the end could have been much better."
5,READS LIKE A NOVEL - BUT IT'S TRUE!,"I saw Ms. Lauck on Oprah and was inspired by her true story - I went out the next day & purchased her book & read it in less than one week (for me that's fast!!!!). The story is told by Jennifer, but through her eyes as a child. It reads like a novel - you often forget you are reading the true story of the author's childhood. It is both heartbreaking & inspiritional - I anxiously await Jennifer's sequel to see how she overcame this childhood and how she survived her teenage years (the most difficult of all for an adolescent) and went on to become a successful, loving wife, mother & author. Thank you so much - I can't tell you last time I enjoyed a book as much!!!!!"
4,Wow,"This is a poignant memoir that I received as a gift. it was well-written, with a believable writing style to convey a little girl's thoughts. Overall well-paced, though I only have one complaint. The book ends rather abruptly. Yes, there is a sequel, but I honestly think that Ms. Lauck should have put both books together, that would have made for a more coherent story."
3,Hmm.,"All I could think while reading this book was, this can't be real. Then again, it was the 70's, maybe things were different then. The sexual abuse, the mental abuse, the lack of parental involvement. Dad disappearing while her mother is sick. Is it really that easy for a child to get dumped in a house and stop attending school? Again, this was the 70's maybe it makes a difference.I read the other review with her concerns, and again, I kept thinking, perhaps it was the time when this occurred.It just seems overwhelmingly unbelievable. Ficton or truth, it did make for an interesting read."
5,A Must Read,"I bought this book to read on my vacation next month. I picked it up to read a paragraph and could not put it down until I had read it from cover to cover. I did not want it to end. What a fantastic story, fantastic life ... fantastic woman. I can't wait for the sequel to see what happened next."
5,Read this book!,"I purchased this book based on the other favorable Amazon reviews and LOVED it! It is beautifully written, heart wrenching and very cleverly told from the perspective of the author as a young girl. I am recommending this book to all of my friends, and am halfway through Lauck's ""Still Waters"" now."
3,Not what you want for learning on-the-go,"This Latin American Spanish book/CD is intended for armchair learning with book in hand and CD playing. The CD does not state the English, then the Spanish, so is not as useful for learning in the car or on the plane as you might want. The lessons themselves are fine if used in the armchair mode. For what it's worth, I couldn't find anything on the package that lets you know this. Unfortunate; usually D&K offerings are first-rate."
1,Very Poorly Made,"Stanley used to make a good plane. In fact, I bought this plane as an addition to a Stanley block plane I have owned for 30 years, which has given excellent service all that time. This plane, however, is a piece of junk. The casting was so poorly done that the sole of the plane was not flat, and spurs left over from the casting that had not been machined off prevented the plan from nesting in the plane body so that the blade had adequate throat clearance. I sent it back to Stanley for a refund and bought a competitor's plane.If you are, like me, a carpenter and cabinetmaker, and need a good block plane, don't consider this one."
5,works fine,"After an unsuccessful attempt to find a decent vintage low angle block plane, I finally decided to try this one. I'm glad I did. The fit/finish is flawless and the performance is great."
5,Great Little Block Plane,"I bought one of these for light duty planing tasks - relieving corners, cutting dowels flush and etc. You do have to hone the pre-ground edge before you use it the first time. It is ground to 25 degrees and recommended final angle is 30 after honing. I used a Veritas honing guide and a Japanese water stone to do the job. It only took about 5 minutes with the right tools!The mouth is easily adjustable with the front knob to regulate the size of your curls. The blade is easy to adjust with the brass knob at the back. It is easy to grip and use. I look forward to getting may years of use out of this well made tool!"
1,Neither of us like it,"Received my 12-960 this morning. Easy to open the packaging--it was secured with one staple. Hmmm. The plane was oiled and the cutter showed signs of hand sharpening. Double hmmm. I guess the previous owner wasn't too impressed with the plane. I spent about 40 minutes truing the sole, then discovered that regardless of bevel orientation the cutter won't extend beneath the sole of this meticulously engineered device. So much for Stanley planes. I give it a one. But it gets almost a three as a kayak anchor."
1,12-960 plane is a waste of metal,"I received this plane as a gift and couldn't be more disappointed in the fit, function, and finish. Major problem with it is that the blade does not extend past the base so it doesn't cut anything even at full extension. It appears that they didn't finish machining the base where the blade rests. Second problem is that the base is very rough. Looks like they finished it with 20 grit and this is supposed to glide across a wood surface? I don't think so, not even close. This one is going back for a refund and I'll try another brand. I am afraid the Stanley name is now meaningless when it comes to quality image."
3,Not bad...,"Not a bad little plane for the money. Keep this one in my toolbox for those occasions I'm doing a little work away from my shop. Wouldn't use it for fine work on my boxes or clocks, but it's ok for knocking the edge off 2x4's or cleaning up some trim. Stanley planes use to be the benchmark everyone else tried to achieve, but now they mostly make ok planes. They are nowhere near the quality of my Lee Valley/ Veritas planes, or for that matter my selection of wooden planes. But they are a good toolbox plane. Takes a little tuning and of course sharpening to get them to perform, but once you have them set up, they do an adequate job. This is a good plane for the money, recommend it as an inexpensive plane."
1,Junk,"One of the reviewer said, ""You get what you pay for"". In this case I am sure you don't even get that. Stamped parts, and very soft metal make this plane useless junk. After more than an hour of tuning and sharpening, the blade edge just folded over on soft fir end grain. Take some time to find an old plane at a yard sale. I gave it one star because the Amazon rating system requires at least that."
4,Best Climbing Helmet Available,"Different heads will fit different helmets, but for me I tried the 3 or 4 ""ultra-light"" climbing helmets currently available and this one had the best combination of fit, adjustability for wearing a wool hat in cold weather, and of course the super-light weight.The only complaint I have, which I have seen others complain about, is that the strap that goes behind your ears is positioned too far forwards, so that it can dig into the back of your ears. My current solution is to let the strap go over my ears, in which case I don't even notice it is there. I have seen someone else use an elastic band to hold the strap further back which would also work.Bottom line is that the helmet is so light and comfortable you forget you're wearing it, which means you wear it all the time and don't have to worry as much about your precious skull-cargo."
2,Weights fall out,"I liked the design of the pieces and the size, but after some time (after play and lots of blitz) the weights at the bottom completely fell out. I tried super gluing them back together but that didn't work. Looking to throw these out and get new ones from a better dealer."
1,Fragile,"This set is simply too fragile. Several of the black pieces shattered within 24 hours of getting the set. We have lots of tournament style chess sets, and this is the worst I've seen."
3,Weighted chess set,The chess pieces are fairly nice. They are weighted and nice and big. The set itself was disappointing. It looks cheap.
3,Chess game,"The person I gave it to said he is teaching his granddaughter. So far she has learned about the colors, name of the chess pieces. She is 3 and half years old"
2,MC 5 - 'Motor City Is Burning' (Castle),"Sixteen track compilation of poor-sounding bootlegged material that's been obviously pulled from various MC 5 previous releases,like the Sturgis Armoury in Michigan for one.QUESTION:where exactly did the taper of 'some' of these tunes sit during the actual performance,in the stall in the men's room?I mean,come on!I believe I even heard some problems with the tape speed.I've heard worse,but not MUCH worse.I suppose that after a few listens,you COULD grow to accept this CD as a hard-to-find audio treasure,IF you're an MC 5 completist.Good song selection though,like the opener ""Kick Out The Jams"",""Revolutionary Blues"",""Human Being Lawnmower"",my all time MC 5 favorite ""Looking At You"" and ""Black To Comm"".You've been warned."
3,"All right! MC5! . . . . Hey, that's not cool.","I have a watch. It's a Casio and it has a calculator and a voice recorder in it. It's a cool watch; it records stuff and you can play it back, like funny things friends said when they were drunk or bad lines from a movie--but the sound quality is crap. But what do you expect? It's on a freaking watch.This live MC5 album sounds like it was recorded on my watch. It's bad. Of course, it's cool because it's MC5, but the quality is h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e. I didn't think they were allowed to release something that sounded this bad."
2,Greatest Heroes & Legends of the Bible,"I was disappointed that the description said nothing about the language being set in Korean. My DVD player in the car can not change languages. Also, there were only 14 DVDs and 1 Frosty the Snowman. I bought this item twice because I believed that this was an isolated case however, this was so both times. The returns were easy and Amazon knew nothing about this problem. They handled the matter very professionally and it did not tarnish my relationship with Amazon."
2,The DVD came in Korean and missing a DVD,"I enjoy the movies themselves. My daughter enjoys the biblical animated movies. We are missing 1 DVD of the 15 DVD's and the one that was in place of it was ""Father Christmas"". Also, ALL the DVD's were in Korean not english with Korean subtitles. The second language was english. So, everytime we play the DVD we have to switch the language to English. When purchasing this product I was under the impression that I was purchasing all ENGLISH DVD's, not Korean."
1,Horrible,I don't recommend this product to anyone with children or even for themselves. The storyline is way off base of the bible and the animators/creators have added a lot of unbiblical bias into the stories. We immediately sent this back.
1,Dont buy it,"DVD's start in Korean. The writing on the cases is Korean and you cannot read it. I am returning it and do not recommend buying it,"
3,Haven't Ordered but won't,"I have to laugh about the video's being in Korean. My husband and children are both Korean, so I might have actually ordered these if the vender had just said what they were. But reading the reviews saddens me. The whole point of ordering the stories is so I can teach my children Christain Ethics, which it sounds like the vender isn't following too well. It's too bad, I was really excited to find these. Back to Disney movies."
1,Nothing says Christianity like teaching young children about whores and genocide.,"Have you all even watched the Samson & Delilah. Nothing like having to explain to your 5 year old what a ""lady of the night is."" Or you know horrifying them with ""mommy why is that man setting those poor doggies on fire."" Great Movies if you want your children to have nightmares and/or teach them to be a future serial killer."
2,bon roller,"This roller arrived to me looking like it had been used as a hammer before being sold to me. Find a different brand, bon sucks."
4,Heavy Duty Seam Roller,"I purchased this tool to use in my leather craft to roll out glue joints after I broke a cheap plastic roller. The first roller that I received was had an eccentric roller and did not roll true. The bearings were tight and had tight spots which made the roller slide, not roll. Edges of roller were not de-burred and were sharp enough to cut. Unfortunately this tool was a perfect example of everything that is wrong with Made In China. I returned this tool to the seller, Tool and Gear, and was pleasantly surprised when a replacement roller was forthcomming without any hassle. The replacement tool was much better than the first. Roller round and true, edges deburred, this was the tool I should have received the first time around! Now I can rate the second roller as a good heavy duty roller and an good buy for the money."
2,Jack,Definitely old movies. It is even hard to recognize Jack in a couple of them. It does show how his movies have progressed thru the years.
1,Wow.,"That's all I can say about this home video production. It would have been great if the person who made this used a Hi-8, or anything besides the late 70's VHS camera this appears to have been taped with. Couldn't he have used more than 2 pieces of wood? I guess not, since this was the smallest fireplace I have ever seen. The hand reaching in with the fire poker was a nice touch. All in all, this is quite humorous. I've purchased a lot of things on the net lately....sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. DO NOT BUY!"
5,An aspiring book on mysticism,"Excellent This is clearly the best spiritual book I have ever read. The book discusses the trinity, creation, man and other areas in very clear terms. I found this book very inspirational and the desire and need to re-read this book due to the difficult subject matter. In closing, although Jacob Boehme was a Christian Mystic, this is a book for people of all religions."
5,Wonderful copy of a wonderful album!,"I had this album on an audio tape in the early 90's, and played it until it wore out. I was so excited to get a copy on cd, and have enjoyed listening to it again. It arrived promptly and in excellent condition, so thank you!"
4,The Moon as seen from Down-Under,"All of the photographs and maps of the moon are shown as seen from the southern hemisphere. This is useful for Australians but perhaps challenging for those in the northern hemisphere (who may need to turn the book upside-down for a familiar view of the moon). And the phases of the moon are also shown as seen from the southern hemisphere. These, believe it or not, proceed differently from the northern hemisphere for the same reason that all those wrist-watches showing lunar phases do not work in the southern hemisphere.The book itself is well written with excellent photographs and diagrams printed on glossy paper. And - rare for a paperback - the binding is sewn together in quires."
5,Much better than expected,"There have been many different shows released in the ""Live"" series. Many of them have middling quality live performances but this album is not one of them. I bought it because it was really cheap and expected a good track or if I was lucky maybe two. Imagine my surprise when the whole disc was full of high quality (both the performance and the sound quality) material. If you are a Greg Lake or an ELP fan you will love this one. Even at a normal price this album is a must-have and at this price it's a steal. I own most everything ELP has released and this one is still a welcome addition to my music collection. I didn't have these versions of the songs on any of the other releases."
2,Runs out of juice faster than Canon branded batteries,"After recharging this battery several times it no longer held a charge as long as a Canon branded battery. I'm not sure that I saved anything since I will now have to buy a Canon battery. If you purchase this battery, pay attention to the return policy. I bought mine in April and it failed in July, past the acceptable return period. I could have returned it at some prorated loss, but it wasn't worth the shipping or time involved. The process seems to be buy one of these. If it works, great. If it doesn't toss it and buy another."
3,Cheap Price,"The battery is a backup to my genuine Canon battery. It seems to work OK, but the exterior black covering is starting to peel away. I will probablytry to purchase a real Canon battery when this one dies. It looks like the old saying ""You get what you pay for"" may be applied here."
3,É uma boa bateria. mas...,"Esperava mais pois a capacidade de 1400 mAh é maior que a original. Entretanto, A carga da bateria tem durado menos que a original da Canon."
1,Less weight! Not last as long as original Canon battery,"Less weight! only 21g instead 25 grams compared to the Original Canon battery.Tested this battery many times,only 75% of capacity, die quickly!!!the battery is made in china said has 1400mah but much less than 1120mah!Not happy with this battery from SterlingTEK on Canon S100 camera, only 40 minutes of video at most!"
5,Excellent battery,"I've bought this battery for my Canon S 100 because I noticed that my battery runs out really quickly. Quality is great, price is a little bit high. But it's really cheaper than authentic one."
5,Use STK's In all My Cameras,"This is actually my third SterlingTek battery I have purchased, having made the decision to use them for all my cameras. They last longer than an OEM without any doubt."
5,A Must for My Camera,"Back up battery for my Canon camera. As a tourist, the Canon NB-5L battery lasts 1/2 day, so, order one spare... maybe more. These are good batteries and the price is affordable."
3,not as good as a factory battery,"It works... I use this battery and the factory battery in rotation, I say 10% more life on the factory battery. This canon camera just eats power, I would like to see some more power saving functions besides turning off the GPS. Overall decent battery for the money at half the price as a canon factory battery."
4,Good one,"The package wasn't best possible, but it arrived quickly and the product was as described...one two three four five..."
5,Excellent Battery Life,"This battery has great battery life, lasts as long as the orginal battery does in my small point and shot camera. I can fill a 2GB card with pictures, before I have to recharge the battery."
5,Works Great,Appears to work fine. I am happy with the purchase. The price was fair and shipped quickly. Hope it lasts a really long time.
5,Always have an extra battery,"As above ,always good to have an extra! Not much else to say about a battery. thanks for the speedy delivery."
1,Very Bad The charge doesnt even last for 5 minutes,"I bought this after reading good reviews about this product. But after i bought it I was surprised that it didn't even last for 5 minutes whereas my old original battery from canon was still lasting for quite some time. I have learnt one thing never go for duplicates, always buy original even if it costs more."
1,Died permanently after first charge as did the charger,"I bought this battery and charger together, I charged it up in the included charger. It died after a couple of pics and never would take another charge from either the included charger or my other working unit. Since these two pieces of junk came together I would assume really poor manufacturing. I've sent them back."
5,Works just like my Canon OEM batteries,"I can't tell any difference between using this battery and my original Canon OEM batteries. This one seems to last the same and takes the same amount of time to recharge. Even if it did last a little less, as some reviewers claim, the price savings way outweighs that. This battery is a bargain. I bought two of these for less than the price of a single Canon battery. (I've only used these for about two months so I don't know if they will last as long as the Canons.)"
4,This cd is tite!,"You can really feel this cd, Olu is coming from the real with songs like Together, and Sista Why. This cat is speaking in ways that is not done these days (which is why he is probely not played in heavy rotation on a majority of stations, it hard to compete with all the trash being played right now). The groove is truly soul and his sound is smooth. If you dig soul music and you like good lyrical content, then grab this.LOVERESPECTSOLIDARITY"
2,Whack,"This is ok if you like that corny sounding r&b. His style would probably be better appreciated in the smooth jazz category because musically, it is lame. No creativity with melodies or chords, nothing special from the rhythm section. The guy does have a nice singing voice, similar to eric benet. However, benet has good musicians that add to his voice. This album is not good."
5,Music that catches you soul.,This is an excellent CD. It is very soulful and the music just keep me listening to it almost all the time.
4,Depth transcends his age,"This young man has quite a gift. I am not normally a fan of popular music, however I did take note of this CD. I noticed on other reviews, other people made remarks about the vocalizations. These comments are unfortunate. It is apparent this young man's voice expresses a depth that transcends his age. In years to come it will be interesting to see how he vocally evolves. He has the tonal qualities of a young Joe Cocker, some of the harmonies that are reminiscent of Hall & Oates and some of the phrasing of Seal and Sting. You can't lose with such a combination. Good Luck."
3,"Good music, but the vocals left something to be desired","If you like the whole neo-soul, Maxwell-esque vibe that's being touted as the new face of R&B, then you'll probably like this album. It's got fairly raw production, but grooves that you can put on and let flow... HOWEVER, the only drawback of this album is the the artist himself. I have no doubt of his talent as a musician, songwriter and producer (I think he played every instrument on most songs, and wrote all of them)... But, as a vocalist, it seems that he wrote every song in the same key, so he could hover amidst the same 3 notes. By the third song, I actually started scanning the rest of the album in the hopes that he would find a new register. I was disappointed. But, again, if you can stand to listen to him talk his way through each tune, some of the music is worth it..."
5,The brother appeals to the soul in all of us!!!!,I received the sampler from a friend and was so excited that I ran out and bought it. It is really refreshing to hear songs from the heart in a language with clarity.....Keep up the good work!
5,Sweet grooves -- puts Erika Badu to shame!!!,I heard bits of Olu's album in December on a college radio station in the area and have been obsessed with it since. I bother the brothers at my local store almost weekly looking for answers as to when this album is going to be available. Many thanks to Amazon to making it so readily available. Pick it up -- its definately HOT!
3,Lack of consistency,"For lovers certainly. For conscious people too. Sound is great and well produced. Stuart Matthewman put a discreet touch of his own to the general product but did not avoid everything. If tracks like ""My World"", ""Sweet Melody"", ""Together"" are, for me, the highlights of the cd. The variety of the voice is the problem. No enough variations did not help me totally focus on the subject. With an executive production of this kind I expected much more. This is the album a lot of artists would just already be happy with but I did not get the travel in which Olu is trying to bring me. We'll check out the second album."
4,chi-town finest,"Usually, I don't like artists from chicago cause of their hard speed flow but it changes when I heard cap one blazin' first album. yeah, he has a speed flow but he didn't keep it the whole album, he's able to change his delivery and that's why this album could be listened without skeepin' a song. There are too much potential singles, the#10 and the#3 with dru hill's nokio have been alreaduy releaed as singles but #2 and # 13 are among the best songs of the album.this debut album is strong and thanks to the source for havin' support this artist ans permit cap to be knowm in france cause ain't advertising right here, so peace to motown for adding a rap touch to his R and B roster. get tha sound, word up !!!"
4,What a difference a don makes,"Cap-one is second to none in terms of his feel for the beat and delivering his message in a hardcore spit-fire type of method. Being a Chicago native myself, I can appreciate the real-life depiction of his growing up in the Windy City. On tracks such as Ladies and Willies (featuring Cannibus) and Pop dem Collas he hold Chicago down really well. Cap-one reminds me of Twista with his style, and probably will one day surpass Twista due to his hunger. He is a young rapper with a lot of potential and this is definitely a solid debut album."
5,illest album ever,"this album is so ill. it's one of the best i ever heard. my old favorite rapper was twista, but now it's CAP. 1. es todo bueno. twista is featured on one of cap.1's songs. this playas got the sickest ryhmes i've ever heard. every song is good. never have ta skip a track! pick this one up. peace, MEXI CAN"
4,Beautiful Journey Through an Unglamourous Life,"This complex story belongs in the same category as 'About Schmidt' in that we are invited for an intimate look at the inner thoughts of a normal, average woman: Grace Alcott. The reader almost matures with the central character from college days into grandparenthood - gaining increased confidence, yet never quite successfully dodging life's questions and doubts. Real life is truly reflected in Grace Alcott's story. Being Mrs. Alcott is a beautiful depiction not of 'and they lived happily ever after,' but rather, 'they continued to struggle and live as happily as they knew how.' An empathetic reader gains a wise perspective on a parent's view of the world: reflections of life's successes and failures from marriage to child rearing to retirement.I would recommend this to anyone with a mother, sister or wife, and I would pass this along as recommended reading to mothers, sisters and wives as well."
4,A good study of human nature.,"I've read all four of Ms. Geary's books and this one is quite different from the other three. It isn't a mystery. It's more of a character study taking Grace from her courtship in the 60s up to the present. Ms. Geary has done an excellent job of not stereotyping each individual, showing that everyone of us has good and bad traits. Her insight and perception over the decades of time covered is magnificent. I couldn't help wondering how she could know this much about love, marriage, human tendencies, etc. Her observations were very perceptive, and interesting. Almost educational."
4,At the movies,"Isherwood's short novel is autobiographical fiction about being hired to write a screenplay for a movie called ""Prater Violet"" during early World War 2. There's lots of world politics, of course, as well as the politics of the worldwide movie industry (Hollywood included). Isherwood's writing is superb, and fills this brief space with a lush garden of a story. Here's a quote: ""This business about the box office is just a sentimental democratic fiction. If you stuck together and refused to make anything but, say, abstract films, the public would have to go and see them, and like them..."""
3,One hit,"Great artists. Fair collabaration. One phenomenal song. ""The Highwayman."" Drops off pretty steep after the one hit."
5,To Ricci K. Saliba,To the reviewer below......Kristofferson is still alive. It's Jennings who has passed on.
4,Best CD of these top recording artists.,"If you enjoy these 4 artists this is the CD for you. All songs on this Cd are great to listen to or sing along with. Each song on this CD is a story everyone can relate to in some form even if it's just someting you have had on your mind lately. My personal favorite is Desparado. We've all have been close to someone in our lives that we have lost but still goes on in our hearts. Great CD, worth th price. If you ever get to see the Highwaymen in person you will not be sorry,these are 4 great men!"
3,Good Start,"I bought this because I was missing ""The Highwayman"" song from my collection.If I had to rate the three ""Highwaymen"" albums this would be #3. The second would be first and the third second.I am a big fan of all the artists that is why I rated this three stars.Pat L."
5,awesome,"This game truly rocks. I enjoy the earth-shaking checks and player animations. Regular seasons on '99 are challenging to new comers;one tip to make a season easier is make your own team, like I did. Besides the infrequent frame jumping and inability for Internet play, a true value for the hockey enthusiast."
2,Ahead of it's time but so old you shouldn't bother with it.,This was the HUGEST thing in 1998. But now with the release of NHL 06 99 is 7 years old and obselete. It's a fun game but there are bett ones out there.(by far)
2,Picasso,"A bit disappointing in printing, choice of works by Picasso, etc. Bought the book for my husband that truly admires Picasso, but he has practically all books dealing with this artist and this one was not great."
3,"Informative, nice pictures, but less usefull as an identification guide","On the plus side, this book has good pictures and the text is full of information useful to fishermen and others. It is also less expensive than comparative guides. As an identification guide, it is considerably less useful, however, since the fishes are organized ALPHABETICALLY and not systematically. Thus, if you know you have a perch, for example, or a carp, you still have to look through the whole book unless you happen to know the name of the fish (in which case you have already identified it of course), and related and unrelated fishes are jumbled together throughout the book. It would also have been nice with maps showing the distribution of each fish."
3,I was disappointed that the photos were not in color. The text is very informative,"I was expection to see colored drawings. The detail other that that is quite good. I shpuld have reviewed this book before buying it, my mistake."
5,Trout Rules,"I have been a Trout fan for a few yesrs now. I was looking forward for some time for a new studio release. The wait was well worth it. Full Circle is great. The guest artist are some of the best; Banamassa, Guitar Shorty, John Mayall, Montoya, Sardinas. Can the blues get any better? I think not. With guitar mixes of guest and Trout on different channels, listening with headphones is the best. I love this album."
4,Smokin Hot Guitar Licks,"Walter does it again! Great guitar licks and a wonderful group of guest musicians! The only problem I had was that some of the songs went on a little too long.A problem Walter has!Not that it is always a bad thing!I do like fast and loud guitar,but sometimes you have to know when enough is enough."
1,"geez, ease up a bit!","Another Walter Trout Cd that sounds like everything else he does. Loud, screaming guitars, loud screaming singing. NOTHING even remotely original here. Why does he have to amp everything up? It all sounds the same after a while. This Cd has nothing to do with real blues. It even sucks as a rock CD. If you have one Trout disc you have them all. The guests add nothing as he overpowers them all."
4,First time Trout buyer - new long time Trout listener,"I caught my first glimpse of Walter Trout on YouTube and decided I needed him in my collection. This is my first CD of his and its a good one. If you like blues, you love Full Circle."
4,Wonderful overview of complex issues,"Barbour does a wonderful job in this book of explaining in layman's terms complex issues in both the fields of religion and science. He explores the overlap and conflict between different theories in each field and shows how the whole ""religion versus science"" issue is too simplified a summary of two such diverse fields. Barbour comes across as highly knowledgeable in both fields and not at all judgemental. A very good, informative read."
4,So adorable,I got these in the mail after ordering them two days prior. They came in a cute little velvet bag. I find them very adorable and received many compliments on the first day of wearing them. The only thing I would like to mention is that the blue tint isn't as blue in real life. I plan to order more jewelry from Silver insanity. Also they are each approximately the size of a dime. First jewelry bought online that I was not disappointed in. I plan to wear them whenever I can.
3,Good Synthesis,"This is primarily a book for historians. Although the book has its moments, it mostly focuses on the historiography of slavery in North Carolina during the period from 1748 to 1775. The authors discuss the origins of North Carolina slaves, treatment of slaves, slave naming practices, slave culture, and the ideology of slavery as North Carolina approached the American Revolution. A fault of the book is that the analysis stops mostly at 1775, cutting off the picture of how the American Revolution transformed the slave institutions of the state. The book is well written; anyone who needs information on the nature and character of slavery during the period will find this to be an authoritative source. Most armchair historians will probably be disappointed that this study is not a narrative; yet, there are many wonderful insights on the nature of slavery in North Carolina for the interested reader."
3,Not Really Sure This Qualifies as Coffee,"I was looking for something to replace the Taster Choice Instant Vanilla Coffee that has become increasingly hard to find. This product is NOT an equivelant.If you want coffee, in its traditional sense, this is not for you. If you want a coffee flavored beverage that is more like a frothy hot cocoa blend, Firside Gourmet is perfect. The flavor is okay, but the consistency too ""full"" to satisfy my morning coffee needs.In addition, this small container does not provide many servings for its price. Each serving requires 3 to 4 teaspoons full of powder."
5,Good for beginners,"I am a newbie to classical music. I love this CD. I realize that it doesn't do justice to many works due to the fact that only one track is played from each work, but to people like me, this is a good starting point. From here, I now know of areas of Isaac Stern's body of work that I want to delve into. I also have a better idea of which composers I want to take a closer look at. In my opinion, for a person just starting out in classical music, this is a good ""sampler"" of classical violin music. It's probably not something for a serious collector due to the fact that it is a collection of previously released works. I would consider it in league with a ""greatest hits"" album from a rock band. It's not for serious listeners, but it's a good starting point for beginners. This is a good starting point."
5,Wicca Par EXCELLENCE!!!,"What a great book on New Age Wicca! Knight doesn't preach at you. Better than Harry Potter because Knight shows you how to do real magick. I practice Wicca, meditation and divination and I love this book!"
4,Ultimately Satisfied,"When I first started working with this book I had the same experience as these other readers and was quite annoyed. However, I emailed Hungry Minds and they said the problem was being corrected in a reprint and they immediately (same afternoon) sent me the missing files. Although there's really no excuse for their error, the new files filled in the blanks and it was smooth sailing from then on. I ultimately was quite satisfied: The author's writing is clear, friendly and informative, and within a few days (I did weeknights instead of the weekend), I had created a fairly complex site with Dreamweaver. (My friends are impressed.)The nicest surprise, however, was that after had written Hungry Minds about the problem, the author herself emailed me with her apologies! She said she was going to post the files on her site at wpeck.com and that they'd be on the HM site. Considering all that, I'd recommend this book."
3,Good teaching style ruined by mistakes.,"The instructional approach is very good and easy to understand when the mistakes didn't get in the way. Most of the book is very helpful and does a good job in explaining dreamweaver, but it will take more than 15 hours. In the last three or four sessions the mistakes begin to really burn up your time. I emailed MS Peck, but received no reply."
3,Good Starter,"I am/was completely new to dreamweaver, I had opened the program once, this book gave me good foundation knowledge and was helpful not just with dreamweaver but also with basic web design techniques and concepts. BUT, yes there is a but, it tended to repeat itself (one entire exercise being repeated), it was also full of errors, some could be corrected if you had knowledge of html and web design, some are corrected on the authors web site, but the rest were just annoying (such as leaving out one instruction which was a vital step). The problems with the CD however are all fixed by downloading the zip file from the authors site. Overall I think this book is a good starter but I would not recommend it to anyone at a higher level than begginer."
3,15 Hour Crash and Burn,Be very careful if you buy this book. Some of the lesson file are missing and there are no resources to retrieve them at this time.
2,Not her greatest work,"As much as I love Chely Wright, and DANG SHE IS BEAUTIFUL, I can't give this album the two thumbs up I wish I could. I am a big fan and loved the album Single White Female, and Let Me In, but I don't think this album was up to that level. I am a fan of Crossover Country Music--the not so twangy kind, so those are my musical tastes. Chely Wright has a signature style of telling a story with a song--kind of like Garth Brooks. However, the story doesn't always hold together well, or rhyme well, or make a good song. Back of the Bottom Drawer was probably the best song-but it's not enough to justify buying the whole album IMO. That said, I love Chely Wright, but this is not her finest work. You might be better off buying Let Me In if you don't have that one."
5,Great CD,"I'm a very liberal Democrat and anti-military, (as well as a member of a family with a large number of Marines and Army soldiers) but I was still moved by the song, ""The Bumper of my S.U.V."" Great CD."
3,The River,"The best song on here is The River. I don't know if there's a true story behind it or not, but the song tells a story that will break your heart and touch you. The Bumper Sticker on her SUV song was very good, too. For fans of Trisha Yearwood, Faith Hill's Fireflies, Corinna Fugate/ All the Mountains, and Miranda Lambert."
4,Back to music,"Chely Wright is back with her first album of new material since 2001's NEVER LOVE YOU ENOUGH, and her first for her new label Dualtone. It's a good effort from Chely. The sound is more organic and stripped back than her last two MCA albums which had a more contemporary country polished feel for them. Chely has a great voice and it's a shame she went from being a hot country star to someone who is finding their way again. I will preface by saying I don't care for Bumper of my SUV. Not for it's content but I just find the song kind of boring, and I know she's making a statement/point in the song but I'm just not interested. She wrote a lot of the songs on this album. I can't quite get into her version of ""C'est La Vie (You Never Can Tell)"". There are some great songs on here, namely ""What If I Can't Say No Again"", ""Southside of Lonesome"", ""Wheels"", and ""The River"". Overall a good effort from Chely that I'm sure will get better with each listen."
5,The Story Needed to be Told!,"This is a fun story, despite the serious issues it raises. It is a common story among millions, but a story that has never been told so well. With up to 20% of the population affected by dyslexia (and 100% of those families!) this story should be read by every educator, by every parent of a child with a learning difference, and by every mother, no matter how ""perfect"" your child is. The story transcends dyslexia and reaches to the basic structure of families and relationships. On top of that, almost as a bonus, it seamlessly weaves in ten outstanding parenting tips in the form of chapter headers, which are original and worth the price of the book alone."
4,I Love This Album,"This is the first album in which the Spinanes (basically Rebecca Gates) employs the help of a full band. Her previous two releases were just her and her drummer. Ths album has a more colorful sound. It's dreamy and folky everywhere but it also has a very modern sound. The first track just busts out with a Casio keyboard and and then a killer riff and lyrics about the beauty of California. ""Den Trawler"" is all about a ""sentimental fool"" who is too busy thinking about his losses that he misses the the clock striking twelve on New Year's Eve. ""72-73"" describes a woman putting herself together after dating the world's biggest prick. It's a perfect album for anyone with ears and a heart. And the whole thing ends with Rebecca scolding her man with the cool line ""That's not how a man acts. Is that what you are?"" It's an awesome and lovely testament to falling in and out of love and hovering in the spaces between."
3,Starts out strong...,"Arches and Aisles could have been great, but unfortunately, it's not. The first four tracks are gorgeous, but over the course of the rest of the album, the music slides into mediocrity. Nothing bad, just nothing spectacular."
2,Be careful.,"I purchased this product recently for my 2001 Ford Focus Street Edition sedan. Apparently there was a 6 month period between late 2000 and early 2001 where the Ford decided to implement a 2-bulb tail light in its sedans instead of a 3-bulb system like this tail light is designed for.Overall the quality of this product seems good and it would have gotten 4 stars; however, having an empty light socket is a real downer."
3,Jazz Trombone Enthusiast,"Jimmy Cleveland was a great ensemble player (playing someone elses music), but he was not a great soloist. Comparing Jimmy Cleveland's rendition of songs that J.J. Johnson had recorded during the same time period, it is obvious why J.J. was rated the best jazz trombonist for so many years."
5,Million-Dollar Makeover a real winner!!,"Cheryl St.John is one of my favorite authors and she does not disappoint in Million-Dollar Makeover. The story is so entrancing that you'll forget all about the time as you read and it's a book you can totally lose yourself into. It is what I would call a genuine page-turner since each page would have me saying, ""I'll read one more page, then I'll put it down and go to bed"". The joke was on me as I never could put it down. I think you'll laugh and cry with Lisa as she tries to pull fast ones over on Riley. Tension builds from the first page up until the end of the story. I couldn't put it down and stayed up entirely too late in order to finish up Riley & Lisa's story. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."
3,Nice little book!,"This is a nice little book that gives a basic history of Zippo lighters and some great pictures and info. I would have prefered more on older Zippos, their value and what to look for but it is still a good reference book."
3,OK ?,"Not much of a book....Odd size format, difficult to place on book-shelves.Other than that the photos are sweet."
4,Well designed book,"COBOL, indeed it is still very widely used today and it is here to stay for a good while, especially with COBOL 2008 coming up.If you have no knowledge in COBOL whatsoever, this book will be your starting point.The thing I like about this book is how they give the many variations of how you can use a certain piece of code, like the many variations of using the EVALUATE statement.The authors is not boring. He's straight to the point and tells you on many occasions what types of mistakes to avoid because we all know how long COBOL programs can be to debug.There is always a different example in each chapter and as the author is adding to the example, the full program is given with sample outputs and the code is available from the CD for you to also test.On top of that, it has colors and gridlines when needed so COBOL code is quite readable."
5,A must-have for COBOL programmers!,"Detailed discussion of every topic, good examples and the self-test is really helpful."
1,Confusing Refill Pricing,"In case other consumers didn't notice, the MP-46 refills come in packets that hold only 60 photos (1/5 of an album), but cost about a third the price of a complete album. If you want to add inserts to hold an additional 300 photos, it is far more cost effective to buy a complete album, take out the inserts and throw away the album covers. Of course you would need to buy the two little posts from a hardware store (I priced them at about 89 cents) that expand the capacity. While Pioneer's product description may be technically defensible, it is confusing at minimum. I am satisfied with the album quality but I feel like I was gouged to the tune of about $70 due to a confusing product description."
3,Pioneer Album Refill Review,"Some of the expander screws were a bit deformed which made them unusable, but I found that I didn't need to use an expander for each refill, so it worked out okay."
4,great product,"This is a great product; however, I gave it 4 stars due to the fact that there was sometimes a film left on the page after opening the plastic cover (where you would place the picture). I could not get the film off. The photo album that these refills go in is the best I've found."
3,Pioneer Refill pages,"I opened several packs of refills and on each page, there were two picture slots that had glue stuck to the bottom of the slot where the picture was not able to sit completely into the bottom of the pocket."
4,80s at its finest,"The short-lived ATF band was an inspiration to others in more ways than one. Its leader, ""Memory"" Banks, brought a tremendous technical knowhow into a group which was funky and electronic. Like Jan Hammer and Josef Zawinul, Banks shines in moments when the electronics transcend the medium, and express a classic sound.Recommended highly."
3,HOW TO PRESERVE DESTRUCTION?,"This is not a bad book by any means, but it is true that it is mostly not a story of a massacre. The Nazi destruction of the town of Oradour is covered at the start, but is clearly not the author's main interest. I wouldn't describe it as 'filler for historic preservationists' as one Amazon reviewer put it, but the event does take back stage.The bulk of the book looks at what happened to the village after the killings, where it quickly became a symbol both for France and the world. Officials sought to freeze the town as it was in June of '44, with considerable success. But how do you preserve destruction? Decaying buildings and cars are not willing to remain stable for decades for our reflection. The struggle to make it so has lessons for preservationists everywhere.Martyred Village is a worthy read as long as the reader is willing to ponder these issues. Anyone looking for a lesson on wartime politics or Nazi brutality in France should look elsewhere."
1,Mostly filler,"This book has a sexy title, but little else to catch one's attention. There are a few pages on the Massascre itself and its significance in the War. The rest is all babbling filler for historic preservationists."
3,A reasonably good book,"This book has a nice variety of figures in a good range of difficulties. The illustrations are generally quite clear. The written directions, while acceptable, are not as clear as in some other string figure books I've used. My major problem with the book is that the authors did not see fit to include written directions for some of the later figures, and they needed it. The pictures are clear when backing up the words, but cannot stand alone nearly as well. Aside from this, I liked the book."
1,Poor head design,"Since the blade is built to be replaceable it is held into place via a slot in the head of the tool. This is all fine and good in theory, but in practice I had lots of gunk (glue, flooring, tile chips) get jammed in between the blade and the head. This causes the blade to turn into a parabola and thus gouge your floors if you don't notice it. I tried to remove the gunk by removing the blade and cleaning it out, but the present of additional material made the fit to tight and I was unable to open the head (2 screws). I stripped one screw, hacksawed a new phillips slot into it, and stripped that. When I returned it to the hardware store where I purchased it they told me that this was not the first time they had seen this same problem."
2,"Hippie rock - good if you like it, painful if you don't","Sorry, all, but this doesn't deserve the accolades it gets. If you're really into the hippy-dippy 60's, the psychedlic movement (whoa, man... far out...), this is probably good stuff. But it's 60's psych-lite, at least from what I could hear. Nothing out of the ordinary. There was much better psych out by this time."
5,Plantagonet,"This is the best book I have ever read in my lifetime concerning biblical prophesy. If half of the things revealed in this book are found to be true, then the only hope for this retched planet and the people occupying it is to have all the leaders of the world, e.g UNITED NATIONS come together and acknowledge that there is a CREATOR who will not allow the devil any more glory. This book is significant of the changing times we are living in."
1,Buy this and get ripped off!,"This seller sent us only one half of the advertised product (the cleaner and but not the printhead), and was unresponsive on our attempts to correct the problem. Don't let this seller fleece you. I strongly recommend you look elsewhere. Caveat emptor!"
1,Cartridge is a refill,I thought it was a good price for a new OEM hp cartridge. It was a bad price for a refilled OEM hpcartridge. Box was full of toner from unsecured packing. What a mess.
4,common is the most underrated mc,"the first time i heard common was on funk masterflex's cd.his freestyle on that made me want to hear more of him.for the last couple of months common has been keeping low, making guest appearences on some cd's.i then came across lyricists lounge.and common was on this, again his freestyle was A+.i kept listening to it over and over.then i decided to buy one of his cd's.i dont know why it took me so long to buy it.but i bought one day it'll all make sense.this cd is great, nice beats, and common flowing over them is great.i listen to this cd a lot.on this cd there is canibus, who put's down some tight lyrics.and de la soul, lauryn hill, and others.i suggest you buy this cd, it is great.joseph marin reporting goodbye"
5,Pure ChiTown Greatness,"This is a great album from Common, and this album is particularly special because it moved away from the acid jazz that was the previous album ""Resurrection"" and into a sound familiar to all hip hop heads. This album represents for Chicago, hip hop, lyricism, and solid production from NO ID and others."
4,Simply Great,"Common represented on the Mic like Always. It's a shame that positive brothas like him don't get more airplay. his lyrics had deep rooted messages along with great beats without a lot of sampling. he had good collaborations with Canibus, Lauren Hill, and Eyrica Badhu. Keep on keepin on Bra, Kamaal"
4,"Good, lacking some beats, but made up for lyrically","I'll keep this one pretty short, this album lacks some in the area of beats, as some of them seem to not match up with Common's vocals or vice versa, and/or they are just un-imaginative. But Common's lyrics definetly manage to bring this CD to a better rating, so I guess I'll end with saying buy at your own risk."
2,disappointed,"The video of the fireplace was not relaxing as I had hoped. I kept watching for bigger flames or charred logs. The scene change little or not at all.I guess I prefer symphony music or caroling over the instrumentals offered on this tape.I am a Christmas nut, but this did nothing for me."
2,I'd pay more for a better one next time,"I have read various woodworking articles that recommended rabbet planes as being good workhorses--I was thinking of planing tenons, etc. (I have an excellent low-angle block plane already). The casting on this unit is rough and poorly machined. The iron (i.e. blade) is *wider* than the body, so you cannot easily use the edge of the plane to shape a tenon while guiding against the shoulder. The bearing surface between the upper and lower parts of the body is a painted rough-cast surface (not machined), so adjusting the size of the throat changes the vertical position of the nosepiece. The bedding surface for the iron is machined out of square. I did a lot of tuning and brought the tool up to a reasonable condition, but I still wouldn't recommend it."
2,Look elsewhere.,"If you are looking for a rabbet plane, I might advise another brand. I put it on my wishlist despite reading other reviews because the wishlist is an easy way for me to communicate what tools I'm interested in to family members that might be shopping for Christmas, etc. When I took it out of the package the sole was visibly concave, the throat opening was slanted and not a uniform width, and the nose piece of the unit was not in the same plane as the rest of the sole. A plane that is not in one plane cannot be usable without investing a lot of sweat flattening it, so I'd rather return it and try another rabbet plane- even if it is more expensive."
1,"Nice idea, lousy execution","I quite liked the idea of this plane, being able to work closely into corners, so I bought one (admittedly the British version, but it looks exactly like this), but after spending quite some time with this I found myself unable to adjust it so that it would do any real work. I chucked it into a corner long ago (at least it is very small so it is not a failure you cannot overlook). I guess that it needs one of the heavier and more stable (also more expensive) models for this idea to really work."
5,Very nice,Feels like a quality piece. Sharp out of the box. Did the job it was bought for. Stanley still makes quality tools.
2,Needs flattening work,"The sole, including the leading tip surface were not flat in the same plane when the iron was inserted. I'm still grinding away to make a flat surface. Again, the iron, blade, was not flat. I'm grinding away to make a flat surface near the bevel edge."
5,Stanley Bull Nose Plane,Stanley Hand Tools from England are out standing. The Stanley Planes for England are made of top quality Steel and are worth the price
2,A noble experiement that failed,"I like and admire Joe Jackson's recent turn toward classical themes and structures; in my opinion, his last two records, Heaven & Hell and Night Music, are triumphs. But Symphony No. 1 is a misstep; it meanders instrumentally and has very little to say. At its most lively it sounds like a tepid imitation of Emerson Lake & Palmer's instrumental works; at its least lively it just fades into the background. Joe Jackson has done some fine work fusing classical and rock music into genuinely original music. If you find that sort of thing interesting, I strongly recommend you check out his CDs Night Music and Heaven & Hell instead. Both represent an artist at the peak of his creative powers; Symphony No. 2 is a noble experiement that failed."
2,Walk on by!,"Without any decent melodic passages, this so-called ""Symphony"" fails to generate any emotional momentum that would make it worthwhile. All it does is serve as a reminder why ELP and the other art-rock groups died. This is really boring stuff. I was looking forward to this CD, based on it's concept, but it's a total disappointment, lacking any of Jackson's trademark ingenuity. A decade ago, Jackson released his first foray into classical music, ""Willpower"". It's a beautiful CD full of inspiring moments. Do yourself a favor, and find that CD if you can."
4,Instrumental music makes the mind go wander,"Joe Jack son has created a wonderful instrumental that takes your mind drifting over the various soundscapes. His keyboards are distinct even in the mist of other goings on. Steve Vai adds his unmistakable presence while maintaining Jackson's musical vision. Jackson combines classical ideas with modern pop and jazz with call backs to Frank Zappa's instrumental jazz circa ""Hot Rats,"" Emerson, Lake & Palmer, even Kurt Weill. The first movement is an awakening, the second movement a release of the spirit, while the last movement is reflection over all that has come before. You might say Joe Jackson summed up his life in this instrumental odyssey."
4,Joe Jackson - Symphony No.1,"This is an interesting symphony. It's not your typical sounding symphony with traditional instrumentation. It's a symphony that blends various woodwinds with drums and other electric instruments and sounds. However, it does feature more traditional instruments like a violin and viola. The symphony manages to progress nicely and it held my interest throughout it's 45 minutes. This album is a little treasure that will stay in my cd player for awhile. It features the great virtuoso Steve Vai on electric guitar."
3,No info,Please provide more info... What materialsnare this mat made from? What's the length and width? Thanks.
1,Pro Trainer?,"Yeegods! the lines on this board are so narrow, they are hard to find close up! This board is definitely for a player who wants to go pro or is a pro! Otherwise, it is much too difficult for the average weekend player. Returned it for the Bandit Plus."
5,A FINE SYMPHONY,"This book is structured like a fine symphony: its unity is the theme of the power of silent prayer; its variety (development of the theme) lies in its metaphors for different life experiences; and its progression is masterful: each chapter grows and reveals its insight, and the final, golden chapter grows to a climax that recapitulates, gathers together everything that went before. CIRCLING TO THE CENTER is a quiet tour de force."
1,A Horrible Reader,"Pretentious and pedantic, this anthology is the surest way to turn students off to the study of social stratification. Grusky's selections are replete with circumlocutory essays that obfuscate the very points they are trying to make. If you have ever wondered if you get what you pay for when buying textbooks, this opprobrious $35, 700 page volume makes clear that you do."
2,I finally did not like the Rattlesnakes stories,I was expected this book had nice miners stories as other Dobie books but I finally did not enjoyed to much the descriptive real and fantastic rattlesnakes stories becasue I like hiking and prospecting very often.
2,Cute - but...,"Arrived 5 minutes ago and it was so cute - I couldn't wait to give it to my Cairn Terrier Rocky. It is now torn to shreads, arms chewed off, stuffing pulled out and little sewn pouch that contains squeaker is in the process of trying to be taken away from the dog. If a Cairn Terrier can destroy it this fast, don't bother getting this for a larger dog. I think a real Chipmunk would have had a better chance at survival :-)"
2,Utterly disappointing,"Ugh. I had high hopes as I plunged into the first Nora Jane story, ""The Blue House"", being initially charmed by adolescent NJ and her Good (capital G) grandmother-- but the magic quickly dissipated. The review by Marron of Boston was spot on. The characters are too flat to capture our empathy. The conflicts are contrived and feel stuck on to the story rather than part of any engaging weave. Loose ends irritate. Freddie, the rich and always perfect husband, is less than a caricature to the point where I could care less when he contracted cancer. I sense that the author has skills that were unfortunately not employed here."
4,Clueless to Image Processing? This is the book for you!,"For those of you looking to enter the wild and wacky world of image processing, this book is all you need! It starts at a very basic and understandable level and leads you gently into an the area of computer imaging and image processing by matrix manipulation. Although this book is written, as its title suggests, for C programming, it gives a good basis for image processing in any language. The code examples are extremely useful if you are using C but you will soon find yourself confident enough to write your own. This is a definite must for all you budding image processors. Enjoy!"
2,a poor picture,I bought this film hoping for an 'oldie but goodie'. I was disapointed. It's certainly old.But is very far from being good. With a poor picture poorly packaged and of all round low quality. I gave my dvd to a local charity shop.
5,A Great Casual Shoe,"This is undoughtably the best and most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. They comform to your feet readily and wear like iron. You'll feel like you'r ""walking on a cloud"". Plus they look great and you'll be proud to wear them."
2,Tracker Review,This shoe fits about 1/2 size too large. Had to return for a smaller size and even it is not comfortable. Would return for a refund but company does not include return labels like every other company from which I have purchased. Will not buy from this company again.
1,Didn't Fit,"I have big, narrow feet. I ordered the right size, but these just didn't fit. I returned them and didn't get my money back. I'm ticked at Clark.Don't buy stuff from Clark."
2,Not Worth It,"Even with a G3, gaming is slow. The graphics are nice, but having to put 250 mgs of space on your hard disk for it really takes out a chunk. importing sim city 2000 files isn't worth it either. Most buildings don't show up in the new version and leave you with blank spots. I was really disappointed with it."
2,Remake of sim city 2000,Although this game has better graphics than the original and sim city 2000 it is just the same old thing. A remake of a fun game with newer and better graphics.
3,"Fine, but Sim City 2000 was much better","Sim City 3000, overall, wasn't a horrible game. Compare to some other ""Sim"" games, and it looks great (SimTower). However, compare it to Sim City 2000, and it stinks. The interface is slower, and less instinctive. The cartooniness also isn't great. The new ideas, such as lobbyists, deals, and garbage are good, but not enough. Changes in the electric system and others parts of 2000, while more realistic, make the game slightly less enjoyable. If given the choice however, choose the better gameplay of 2000 over this glitzy game."
3,"Entertaining, but something's missing","I remember how absolutely addicted I was to the original SimCity on the Mac. SimCity 2000 pushed the envelope further and made a great game even greater. Now here's SimCity 3000, which visually is incredible, but really it doesn't pack the 'wow' factor of its predecessors. The clunky Windows interface doesn't help, and the system requirements are riduculously high. My 200 MHz G3 Powerbook with just over 100 meg of RAM barely needed a chunk of Virtual Memory to run it, and it ran somewhat slow. Only now with a G4 does it run smoothly. Like I said, the graphics are excellent, but probably the only true advancement from SimCity 2000. They've added building types and expanded the whole city council/advisor aspects, but I expected a lot more from this one. Still, if you're a SimCity nut, it's not bad."
1,Possibly the very worst Mac game ever,"I wish the person who had given me this as a gift for my birthday would've read these reviews first. This game is possibly the worst I have ever played on a Mac. And it's made even worse by the fact that Sim games in the past were among the best. The game play is indeed painfully slow and frustrating, even on my G3. The interface is awkward and ugly. ANd it takes up way too much space on my hard drive! Too bad I broke the seal on the box because now I can't return it anywhere and I'm left with a very expensive paperweight. Maxis and EA really screwed this one up and I'll be very wary of any games by them in the future."
2,Sim City 3000,"This is a very disappointing version of a great game. The manufacturers have disgregarded the system-specific needs of macs and opted instead for a crude port of the PC version.It runs incredibly slowly and crashes often, even onb a fast G3 mac. The save routines don't work. The box claims you can download additional buildings, templates, etc., but you can't! They are all for the PC.Disappointing."
1,Rip off,"Not only are the system requirements insane and the game play glacial, but the interface is a Windows hack thrown on a Mac shell. Maxis is now owned by Electronic Arts. And they obviously don't care about quality software. EA has ruined a good product and feel they can foist anything on the consumer. It's time the software industry faces a million Ralph Naders. Don't buy SimCity 3000! Don't buy any Electronic Arts games! Who are the real software pirates?"
2,"Great Performance, but very poor quality recording","Jimmy Preston just plain rocks out. However, the recording is off a vinyl LP not the master so the sound is flat with lots of hiss and pops."
5,Friendly,The muzzle fits my Rottweiler. yet he knows how to take it off. I washed it and it hasn't changed it's size. that is a nice product.
3,The Myth of More Information = Good Book,"I really wanted to enjoy this book, but, I don't know, there was just something about it. I don't think I learned anything from this book. It seemed more like one of those ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" books than anything else."
4,Good Vice,"Apparently Amazon has been selling this vice for several years and other reviewers have had problems with shipping and damage. I had none of those problems and have installed the vice and it is working well. The only negatives are that the wooden handle sent with the vice is very wimpy. I will make a new one myself. Also the front and back jaw are slightly out of alignment, which wouldn't show, but I have installed mine into and extremely nice workbench and it does show."
5,Jorgenson woodworking vise,I was a little concerned considering the vise was poorly packed in its box and after reading past reviews about this product. But the vise was ok and is now mounted to my bench doing quite well...
3,Good Vice but poorly packaged,"The vice is well built and fits my bench nicely, however, the wooden handle cap was cracked into three pieces when the product arrived. If it wasn't for this, I would have rated the item 5 stars."
1,Don't make the mistake of buying this vise.,"When I first took it out of the box, I had to double-check that I was shipped the right vise. The casting of both halves was so mismatched, I thought it was a cheap knock-off. There was so much polyurethane on the wooden dowel handle that I couldn't fit the caps on without splitting them - I had to sand the finish off first.The quick-release feature was fun the first couple of times I used it, but it quickly became a pain. A half turn back releases the outer jaw so it can be pulled out or pushed in. But it doesn't slide very easily and the half turn doesn't fully release the work. And, of course, continuing to turn out doesn't do anything because the gear mechanism has released. I eventually ""fixed"" it by drilling and tapping a threaded hole into the quick-release gear from the front while the gear is engaged. A screw in this hole will jam up against the inner jaw and prevent the quick-release gear from doing its job."
3,"Has promise, but doesn't quite make it","This is an interesting novel which starts out with the dicovery of a fragile hand written letter and a picture of a German woman and her two children from the WW1 era. From here there is a journey of emotions - first to return the photograph to its original owner, and secondly for the primary character to unravel some of the mystery of his father's past.A very interesting start to a novel, but somehow in attempting to make comment on a divided Germany and how people lived in the East and West, it misses a beat. There are no strong observations one way or another, and even the family mystery is easily guessed.Overall I found this novel quite disappointing. It could have been quite something, dealing as it does with a period of history that is barely touched by western novels, but it falls short. It is neither a great mystery or a great historical novel, but it could have been both."
5,Very comfortable shoes.,"I wore these shoes on a 8 day trip in Scotland , wore them everyday and they were the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned."
5,"A ""Must Read""","The opening chapter of this book was read to our congregation as a sermon. It was very captivating-immediately after, we took Communion and it was so appropriate! This book is very well written as you feel you are a part of the story. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of some spiritual uplifting."
2,steve vai's songwriting limitations,"Unfortunately after yngwie j.malmsteen's departure from alcatrazz band ,(for a mediocre solo career),steve vai came in yngwie place.And i said unfortunately because this record wasa commercial disaster.Besides the great songs""stripper"" and ""painted lover"" all the other songs are mediocrities.""Disturbing the peace"" was an experimental album that also displayed steve vai's songwriting limitations.Although larynx acrobat graham bonnet do almost his best with his supreme voice in order to save the album,""disturbing the peace"" was a commercial flop."
2,Hate to give this such a bad review,"I'm a big Graham Bonnet fan and as a guitarist, I love Steve Vai. However, this is just a mediocre album. Not one song stands out, including the opener ""God Blessed Video"", which got some airplay on MTV. It's a decent song, but nothing memorable. Track #5, ""Desert Diamond"" is an attempt at an epic piece, but is just missing something. It could have been special. You could listen to this entire album and not have one melody stuck in your head. On the positive side, Graham Bonnet sounds great, and Steve Vai has a few good solos. However, the previous Alcatrazz album with Yngwie blows this away.Best song: 5. Desert Diamond"
2,Almost there ...,"5 stars for including the live CD 2. The mastering of the 1st CD isn't bad (I have the earlier Japanese CD to compare to). But like at least one other reviewer mentioned: THE LAST SONG ON CD 1 IS CHOPPED IN HALF !! Unforgivable, but I only bought this for the live CD anyway. And why did they change the cover? Nothing wrong with the original IMO, which is better than this one.There are also ""bits"" of something at the end of tracks 5 and 7 that shouldn't be there.As for disc 2, kind of bright actually. They could have brought up the low end a little more. Also, there are these annoying gaps present between each track that shouldn't exist. (Like what most MP3 players do: insert a gap in between each track.)I guess no one bothered to listen to the finished product."
5,A must have for all the Steve Vai fans.,The remastered Cd is awesome. I've been searching for this one on CD for a long time. I never could find it on CD. It's a must have if you love Steve Vai.
4,Finally!!,"I'm glad this album has been re-released after 20+ years. Alcatrazz was an underrated band from the mid-80's that featured the fine talents of ex-Rainbow lead singer Graham Bonnet and guitarist Steve Vai. While the synthesizer work makes the album sound slightly dated, Bonnet's distinctive vocal style, Vai's guitar work, and the catchy melodies make this an album to remember.Hearing this album again really brought back memories from high school. I hope a new generation of listeners discovers this (mostly) overlooked gem."
4,One of my favorites,"With the exception of a couple of songs on this CD which I didn't love, this album is simply incredible. Such powerful lyrics... I feel SCC's only rival in sheer talent and worshipful approach is Twila Paris. ""More to This Life"" is easily one of my top three favorites of his."
4,One of the best,"This is one of those albums that I go put on when I've had a particularly ""Lord, isn't it time for that rapture yet"" kind of day. It stays in the CD player - a true mark of a favorite."
5,My favorite album of all time.,"This has got to be my favorite album of all time, and not just my favoritie Chapman album, but it's that too.It is a very smooth sounding album that just drones on beautifully. So spiritual and that part is very important, don't forget.I have fond memories of this cd and that was 10 years ago that I first bought it. Hooray!I like all his '80s albums but my second favorite is Real Life Conversations. I listen to these two older albums the most by far of all his records.It kind of has a countryish sound to it too, which is cool."
1,Houdini Cat Took Muzzle Off!,"My cat is a difficult feline that loves to eat and we bought this to quiet him down before meal time. The cat got it off of his head within minutes so I do not recommend this to cat owners that have cats like mine. This is good for the lazy cat that sits and does nothing, but why would you need a muzzle then? Trust me on this one... and they say that they actually tried this crap!"
5,Nice Book,Very helpful book. Details commands well. Could use more examples of the depth of commands but a true asset for anyone interested in scripting with KIX.
5,Shop at amazon.com,"What can I say about sandpaper, except that it's easily accessible through amazon.com. No longer are we held hostage by the brick and mortar home improvement stores. And I love it."
3,"beware, no Lady Lovelylocks----","This DVD is great for 2/3 of the promised program-- Jem episodes and Rainbow Brite episodes are fun and play fine--- However, no matter how i tried to get to it, including watching the entire program, Lady Lovelylocks does not play AT ALL-- it is only a black screen that you cannot even menu through-- then goes direct to rainbow Brite-- so BEWARE!"
1,Dull. I want my money back.,"Tried using these on my long haired dog, and it didn't cut at all. what a waste of money. I thought it would fit on my wahls clippers, but I had to buy the different, more expensive clippers to try this blade out. That ended up being a waste of money, since they don't cut."
3,Kindle version quality,"I ordered the kindle version of ""Rose In Bloom"" after reading ""Eight Cousins"" also by Louisa May Alcott. I like the story but the punctuation in this version is horrendous!!! There are question marks used inappropriately at the end of sentences and many other punctuation errors that detract from the reader's enjoyment. It does not appear that this kindle version was proofread before being released. If details like punctuation errors don't bother you, go ahead and purchase it, otherwise look for another version."
3,"First Cousins, a flawed romance","Eight CousinsThis novel is a sequel to a very nice book for young people.This book is a well written 19th century romance by a classic author.Even with some tragedy , it is still artificially sweet by literary realism standards of today. The romance is marred by the modern genetics of recessive trait doubling in which, practically, first cousins shouldn't marry and have a family. The romance is nice in which the geek wins out by becoming a doctor and a poet."
3,Not as good as it's mate-Eight Cousins.,"I don't mean to sound negative, but to me this book is a disappointment when compared to other Loisa M. Alcott books ( I should know, because I've read and own many of them.) It actually isn't as bad as I make it sound, when you stop and think it has a good moral: Wealth attracts suitors and friends who care only for your $. An altogether satisfactory book."
3,"Review of ""Rose in Bloom""",I received the book in a timely manner. The book was in thecondition advertised.
2,I detest it.,"Decidedly, I do NOT like Rose in Bloom. I love all of Louisa May Alcott's other books, but I don't like romances, and I could tell in the first few chapters what was going to happen in the end of the book. I love Eight Cousins, but I have no fancy whatsoever to Rose in Bloom. I think that anyone who likes romance and the older Rose Campbell will like this book, and I think anyone who does not will share my opinon."
3,More Disappointed in Amazon than the Product,"First, the product. This was no cakewalk to assemble. I will have to glue some of the perches in place to keep them from wobbling or falling out.Second, Amazon. One might be led to believe (from Frequently Bought Together) that the Heath MP-15 Telescoping Pole and Heath BP-15 Mounting Bracket would be just the thing. NOT! The S&K; Barn has a proprietary base. The Heath pole and mounting bracket (although of seemingly adequate quality) will not work with the S&K; Barn without extensive modification of either the base of the S&K; Barn or the Heath Mounting Bracket."
1,misleading advertising,I bought this with the impression that the gourds and bracket came with the order. I was informed by Northern Tool that that would be an additional 72 dollars. Very misleading advertising. Customer Service wasrude about the situation blamed it on Amazon. Will not buy from NorthernTool again!!! Northern tool item # 16935
1,don't buy your wasteing your money,"I bought this bird house because I didn't have time to build out of wood. The house looked good on box and the instructions were clear. the inside walls of house are crap. It as impossible to get the second floor installed without trashing the first floor. the inside walls are made of cheap flimsy plastic. I ended up throwing most of it in the trash. This house would only be a good deal if it was sold at the dollar store for $.50 If you buy, you will be sorry"
4,Enjoyable - Anne MccAffrey is the queen,If you enjoy puzzles and role playing this is a good option. The graphics are good. It requires logic and thinking not just blood-letting. I will purchase anything with Anne McCaffrey's name on the cover and I was not disappointed. The story develops well and the action continues to grow.
1,Pure crap,brought product because it was external stop working for no reason after the 90day warranty expired it worked great for 90 days i think it was programmed to do so to much a coincidence. burned cds slowly and works best with tdk recordables other brands it spits back out the drive is not repairable support from hp is much to be desired.
2,Folk Blues Fest 66 CD,"an alright CD at best in my humble opinion . Sound quality is good for a live recording and there is a large variety of music and a fair selection of artists on this particular disc but personally , there were only 2 artist i've ever heard of and only 3 on the whole cd that i liked but thats just me"
3,Good Tool,This is a good tool and works well for me and my projects. I would buy it again and recommend for others.
4,Quick read,"Mike Hall does a great job of bringing the characters to life and telling this true store. However, as someone who has a dozen Jamaican stamps on my passport, I was looking forward to reading about the land, customs, smells and other items which help raise a good story to a memorable book! Unfortunately, my impression is Mike Henry has not spent a lot of time on the ground around Rose Hall (maybe he has... just dosn't feel like it). It is still a good story and interesting read."
5,Rose Hall,"I enjoyed the book, but I ordered the wrong author. Years ago I read the White Witch of Rose Hall by another author? Cannot find the book. Do you have any other? Thank You"
3,"Good CD Package, Lack of Sound","This CD set of Glenn Miller has a lot of songs. As I listened to my first CD, I noticed the sound. There seemed to be something missing. I pulled out some of my other Glenn Miller CD's and compared them. I have Platinum Glenn Miller, Popular Recordings, The Lost Recordings and The Secret Broadcast.There were several CD's with better sound. The CDs that sounded better were from the RCA label, Platinum Glenn Miller, The Lost Recordings and The Secret Broadcast. One CD that I do not have but I am certain will sound great is the Essential Glenn Miller. I have many Essential CD sets which have outstanding sound.The CD set has alot of songs of Glenn Miller, but there are other CD sets have sound better quality.I hope this information will help.I wish that the Complete Glenn Miller set would be restored and released, RCA are you listening? Currently, the complete Glenn Miller is out of print."
1,Missing Parts,The hinges were missing the screws. The cost to send it back was more than the item. I got screwed but not the screws.
3,Don't seem to last,"Reason for this review is our outstanding Coleman cooler had the hinges crack and break at the ""hinge"" flex part. The cooler is awesome, its the extreme model and holds ice like crazy, but why do I have to replace the hinges? Why would I buy these again knowing they have a short life span? I'm considering it as they will fit, but don't like idea of having to replace them all the time."
1,Why bother?,"Why replace poorly made hinges with new poorly made hinges that will break just like the original ones did? I thought about replacing them with Coleman stainless steel hinges, but with shipping they came to almost $20. So I went to Lowe's and bought a set of Gatehouse 3-inch brass hinges for $2.98. It takes 6 screws, so I used the original four plus two 3/4 inch self-drilling pan Phillips screws. It works great! To hold the lid upright, I loosely installed an additional screw on the side of the lid and another on the side of the cooler, connected them with a piece of speaker wire, then cinched up the screws. A great, permanent fix for three bucks."
3,Not a good design,"Coleman has you here, unless you make something yourself to support the lid it will break again. The hinge part is thin plastic which will crack and break after being in the weather. The price is high for what it is, but as I said earlier Coleman has you between a rock and a hard place."
4,Easy to use and a cheap fix to a design flaw,These replacement hinges are a snap to install and fit perfectly. The reason they receive four stars instead of five is because I should never have had to replace them in the first place. Why Coleman installs a folding plastic hinge on an otherwise rugged cooler is beyond me.
5,"Easy to install, perfect fit","Very fast shipping, hinges fit my cooler (19 yrs old) perfectly, removed old & replaced with new in less than 2 minutes. Did not want to buy a new cooler - this one is the best cooler we have ever owned - glad I could get replacement parts."
4,Coleman Hinges,The product arrived on time and as expected. The Coleman hinges were easy to install. Everything from the order process to the installation worked great!
4,"It works great, but it's not a standard size.",These hinges will probably fit bigger Coleman coolers. My cooler is mid size and the holes in the hinges did not match exactly with the ones in the cooler. Not a big deal since I only had to center it and open new ones and is probably better because they are tighter like this. It works perfectly now. Just wanted to let people know that this are not standard size and do not fit (perfectly) all Coleman coolers.
4,Coleman replacement hinges,The hinges arrived on time and exactly as described. They worked fine on my old broken Coleman cooler. The only problem I have is that these are of a cheap plastic design and are guaranteed to fail in a year or two.
3,Coleman,"I would order again, the item was exactly what I needed & the price could've been beat locally, probablly would not do it again"
3,Ok Movie,"I'm not a fan of this type of movies but I like when a movie has action, drama, and suspence. This movie has all of it, specially fights. They are ok, the effects are not the best, but pretty decent. For people that are into these type of movies, I know that there may be better option, but this one is not a bad option.*Sponsored Post"
3,"Not essential, but quite pleasant","Eddie Cole had a pretty famous brother, but he was a fine musician himself. These recordings from the late 40s capture the small combo sound quite nicely. This is not brilliantly played or brilliantly arranged, but it is charming, well-done and consistently listenable. Eddie's voice is smooth, silky and suave, and is a pleasure to listen to. Some funky piano, well-played if not fiery sax, appropriately jive-y bass and tidy drumming does a good job capturing the smoke and ambience of a small club."
2,good knife,"good knife but hundred bucks for ""made in taiwan""? no thanks. ordered it for my friend and decide to order one for me if I like it but will search for something made in USA."
2,"Good knife, second rate sheath",The knife was fine when received. But SOG makes some of the worst sheaths in the industry. Case in point the kydex sheath that came with the knife. It was so tight I couldn't get the knife into it. Don't they ever test these things at the factory? I had to take an automotive screwdriver and cram it down into the sheath and work it back and forth to get it to loosen up so the sheath would accept the knife. I still don't have it right yet. By the time I also worked the knife back and forth to get it to fit it lost its edge and I'm going to have to get it sharpened. SOG needs to work on their sheaths and put a little more effort and workmanship into them. It's a continual problem I've encountered with their fixed blade knives.
2,Twain on Automatic Pilot,"Twain could always come up with a good yarn, and this is as good as any, so far as plot is concerned. But this send-up of the Sherlock Holmes genre never really gets off the ground. A send-up should be funny. But there is too much in the plot that is evil and dark, so Holmes' appearance -- and his incorrect solution -- become merely annoying. The reader on the tape version does what he can to keep things moving along, but he cannot stifle the inevitable feeling in the listener that this is Twain churning out words for money. Still, it IS Twain after all, and so it does have its moments. Just not enough of them."
3,ipod docking station,"I purchased this product, GPX IBR2807DPPNK iLive Boombox w/iPod Docking Station, for a xmas present. When I order the item I ordered it in purple but when I got it the item was pink...So just a little FYI for you. Either color works for me but be sure it works for you too, who knows what color you are going to get! Happy Holidays!!!"
4,good product for the price,"i was very pleased with the promptness of delivery. It was received in 2 days. The only thing that I am not thrilled about is that it only has the two speakers and I do not get the full sound from my downloaded songs. It is perfect for the beach and I LOVE the color. I was also confused to see that the same radio in Green (which is the color I initially wanted) was over $10 more. I did not understand that. I'm sure it had to do with popularity.For the price and my purpose of use, it is PERFECT."
1,Sometimes you DON'T get what you pay for,"When I found that this iPod box would in fact work without batteries, I hoped that the other bad reviews were also incorrect.I was wrong.THIS BOX DOES NOT WORK WITH CURRENT 30-PIN iPODS!!!!!!!!!!!The reason why it's so cheap is because it's OUTDATED!!!!!CAVEAT EMPTOR! Thank G*d it WAS so cheap because, of course, to find out it didn't work meant I had to open it and assemble it and now I can't return it.A real POS."
1,Terrible Product,"This product is as bad as they come. We purchased two of these units for our iPods and in less than 30 seconds, both units fried (literally) both of our iPods. To make matters worse, the customer service at iLive was horrendous. You couldn't find people more rude, obnoxious, and couldn't care less about user-experience with their products. Thankfully, the people at amazon.com were gracious enough to allow us to return this abysmal product."
1,dissatisfied,The item was misrepresented. It was a gift for my daughter to use with her IPod. She could not use the product. We had to return it.
1,I love it!,"I love my I-pod radio, one of the best purchases I have ever made! I use it every day, while I'm cooking, cleaning the house etc. it's awesome!"
4,"Good product, poor description","This is a great product save for one important feature: The CD player works well, the Ipod cradle is child-friendly, and the pink color is just fantastic for my girls; unfortunately, it does not charge my Ipod Nano (4th generation) 8GB.I called the manufacturer and they said they only supported charging the Ipod Nano up to the 2nd generation.I wish the product description includes this most important fact.So, I had to return the product for full refund."
1,Fragile ipod dock,"A family member purchased this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. It's worked well under moderate use for four months until today. When the ipod was pulled out of the dock, the connector came with it. I opened it up and found the docking connector was held in place by only four solder points, no screws! What genius engineer decides that lead based solder is strong enough to hold a heavy use connector in place? A product is only as good as it's weakest component. Look elsewhere if you want something that won't end up in the landfill."
5,Yes to the boombox,This is a great tag-along for the iPOD. I listen to mine every night. The only thing is that it doesn't charge the iPOD while it is in the boombox but aside from that it is definitely worth the investment.
4,ipod boom box,"used the little ipod boombox a few times, worked very good, was glad to see it charged my ipod while it played. sound was ok for such a small player."
4,iLive Review,"I really like this boom box. I love that it's the same color as my iPod Nano, and it's very compact and easy to take with you. It's perfect for the beach! It works on batteries or you can plug it into an electrical outlet. The best part is that it charges your iPod when it's not in use! It also has a radio and a clock. It's a great little boom box!"
1,avoid at all cost,"I tried this product 3 times, and it was terrible! The docking part is extremely sensitive and easily breakable apparently as one wouldn't play the ipod after two weeks while the radio function still worked and another didn't work at all after three weeks. Thank goodness I could return it and had it back before the warranty or I'd be even more angry."
2,Waste of money,"This is a waste of money, you get what you pay for. I bought it so my Grandkids could dance. Kept it out of reach so they couldn't fool with it and it stopped working in 3 months."
1,Does NOT work with ipod 4th gen touch (32 gb),"I got it and I was really excited. But then I connected my iPod and it wouldn't play. I thought it was broken but then my dad got out the list of ipods it worked with and mine wasn't on there. This product does not give you this info until yo have bought it and opened it. THIS PRODUCT IS WORTHLESS TO IPOD TOUCH 4TH GEN 32 GB USERS!!(Dad's note: The description is out of date at Amazon, and even at the product's own website [...] Seems only to work up through 2nd gen? Very out of date.)"
2,ITouch 2nd generation not supported !,"Unfortunately, this VERY cute Ipod speaker & charger boom box does not charge or play the 2nd generation IPod Touch, even when we put in the correct #4 bracket (as told by an ILive customer service rep). We thought the description was misleading which stated that this unit charges all Ipods. The sound was nice for a small boombox, but strangely, the batteries continued to pop out and the battery door would not remain closed. We ended up taping the battery door, but ultimately we returned the unit anyway for the lack of compatibility."
3,Not among the best,"I was eagerly anticipating hearing this, but I am disappointed by it. The primary flaw is that the tempos are just too fast, losing the sonorous, spacious quality that it requires. It is amazing how much difference it makes when the second movement is performed in 20:14 rather than 21:33 as it is on the Downes/BBC recording (the best one available); it sounds as if there is much more difference than that. It is well played, but not terribly transparent and feels extremely rushed. I feel that the very best tempos are found on the old (1952) Scherchen recording on Westminster, although the performance isn't perfect (in 1952, essentially a live performance!). I would love to see it released on CD, although it's highly unlikely. The Downes/BBC version is rather slow in places, but it certainly is played extremely well and the recording sounds terrific. I think it is considerably better than this one."
2,boring,I'm a big fan of Russian symphonies but I didn't care much for this one. It represents the dead end of the romantic symphonic tradition. It's a lot like a Mahler symphony only more bloated and boring. Thank God Shostakovich and Prokofiev came along. An extra star for Botstein's continuing effort to make available obscure works even though some works are obscure for a reason.
4,First real woodworkers vise,"I have used metal-working vises, clamps, and other rigs and jigs on my workbench but this is my wife's Christmas present to me. It works well. Only took a little while for me to get the hang of the interrupted screw that lets you instantly adjust the jaw opening. I have yet to get bench dogs set in my bench but I plan to for planing and routing big work pieces."
5,"Fantastic image, good story","This is one of these restorations that looks like it was shot yesterday, the print used is visually rich and stunning, and I cannot say enough about it. Of course F. W. Murnau was the director, and it has his characteristic stylistic touch."
3,One of Murnau's last films,"This is one of director F.W. Murnau's last films. The plot involves a young man from the country traveling to Chicago to sell the family's wheat crop. Falls in love with a waitress (the City Girl) there, and brings her back to the family farm. The patriarch of the farm is aghast, hates her, and tries to drive her away. Some of the hired farm hands also try to move in on the City Girl. Climax of the film is a storm set to ruin the wheat crop before it can be harvested. Will it destroy the farm, as well as the happiness of Country Boy and City Girl?I didn't find this film exceptional, and it definitely isn't one of Murnau's best in my opinion, but it is worth watching. The musical score doesn't always fit and there are no extra features in this version. If you are a Murnau fan, its worth a look, however. Three stars just because its a Murnau film, two stars otherwise."
1,Product description doesn't match the item,"Understandably a pair of Wolverine boots for 1.50 seems too good to be true, and 99 times out of 100 it is. This is probably the 10th time an item has been falsely advertised. I have purchased a $100 DVR watch for $5 that was a promotion. All I knew was it shows the boots picture and describes it as such. This company doesn't answer emails and I wouldn't touch their stuff again. Waste of time and money"
3,I don't get it??,"This album is consider a must-have and a 'classic'. I respect other people's musical choices. We all have different tastes. But if you want to hear Whiteheart at there best then purchase 'Tales of Wonder' and 'Highlands'. By far, Whitehearts best music, in my humble opinion."
5,FINALLY a small easy to swallow Vitamin C!!,"I don't do chewables, in general they have carbs and the C is also not all that great for your teeth, that's a lot of acid. The alternatives I've found were always big chalky horse pills that stick on the way down. These are small flat-ish oval pills with what appears to be light coating, or at least they are smooth. I can toss a couple in a hand full of vitamins and supplements and never notice them. If you've been searching, your search is over. I take several other Schiff supplements - melatonin plus and Glucosamine and they are wonderful. I really really recommend these if you're looking for a small easy to take C - it's only 500 milligram, but I can take two of these easier than one 1k milligram of the other products."
2,"Well-intentioned, but poorly written","I work in the criminal justice system and therefore have worked closely with a lot of victims of terrible crime, including sexual abuse. It may give some of them some degree of ""closure"" to read this vigilante novel: but they are more likely to be put off by the graphic and vulgar sexual content - and the atrocious spelling and grammatical errors, which occur on about half of its pages. Here's a sample, just from one page (245):""stood out like a SOUR thumb"", ""the SPEAR set of keys"", and ""breathed a sigh of RELIEVE"". My favorite spelling error is prosciutto (Italian ham), which is spelled ""prochuto"". I'm not kidding! Get a copywriter/editor for the next edition - these errors are very distracting."
1,PURE GARBAGE,"First of all, I am going to say shame on any reviewer who gave this anything over 1 star. You were either paid off or you will give anything 5 stars. While I applaud the author for venturing into such a controversial genre (pedophilia, rape, incest and such) and bringing to light some of the horrific things that are happening to children, I condemn the notion that we are supposed to overlook the glaring and obvious grammatical errors. It not only detracts from the story it overwhelms it. I for one am sick of books that are either poorly edited or not edited at all, especially from someone who once claimed to be an Executive Editor (??). It is just this type of juvenile writing that justifies the stigma that is attached to self published authors and small publishing houses. Denise Campbell has a story to tell, she just needs to get someone to write it for her."
1,Great return process,"the bad: it didnt work out of the box, the instructions were HORRIBLE I spent an entire day trouble shooting and never did get it to work. Cranes customer service wasn't ever available (closed on a weekend? this is a weekend project.)the good: Amazon shipped it fast and the return process was easy. The UPS man picked it up with a label and I got a fast refund."
1,Trash!,"Omg this is the worst album I've heard.The only good song is her first single.I'm sorry but this is like a kiddie young girl album and they need to kick her out of the ROC.Don't get this,I thought they would do better than this piece of crap, I mean the Rocfellas make good music but this ain't it."
1,What a Joke,"i agree, an r&b artist? aligning with rap is backwards....rap simply sucks, pure soul music is the roots of most popular music.....this cd is here today....gone tomorrow.....dam im gonna go play martha and the vandellas"
1,THIS NEEDS TO END!!!!!!!!!,"First of all, im tired of all these new R&B; artist coming out and assuming they are the ""princess"" just because a rapper is backing them up. They only person who's proven that is Mary J Blige, and thats why she is the queen. Teairra hasn't proven nothing to be calling herself the princess.Going back to her album, its not a good cd because there is nothing in here that you can relate to. She doesnt even sound like an R&B; artist. She uses the ""N"" word way too many times and that was getting on my last nerve. If you want to hear some real music then you should get Keyshia Cole's, Fantasia's, and Rihanna's album."
3,IT WAS OK NOT ALL THAT,This cd was ok it put me to sleep 4 a min but i had to play it again and i was like its ok but i would not tell no one to go out and buy it till they hear it frist . SO DONT BUY TILL YOU HEAR IT
3,Not Bad,"For a 17 year old, her debut wasnt bad at all. She has talent but its evident that she still has some growing to do vocally. Either way, some of the tracks are really hot. Aside from the debut single, hit bangers include the edgy ""Stay in ya Lane""- produced by mr. ""Darkchild"" - (not surprised...he really delivers on this joint), the cute/sassy ""Lala"", and ""No Daddy""...Niiice beat..suitable for the club but not lyrically suited. The album only delivers a couple nice jams to slow it down a notch ""Phone Booth"" and ""Act Right"". They both have a good feel to it. On the down side, the album could have done without a couple tracks...i really wasnt feeling MVP, Confidential, and New Sh*t. Overall, she did ""well"". For her next album (if she gets there) she should consider slowing it down a bit. More R&B than Hip-Hop."
2,Jay-Z could've done better!,"When I first heard the first single from Teairra Mari's album I was excited that ""THE ROC"" had finally got a female artist on their label,that is until I bought and listened to the whole album, although she has a nice voice it seemed as if she was just a more streetwise version of Ashanti! I swear that the whole time I listened to the album I was thinking about The Roc vs Murder Inc.! On most of the songs her voice is drowned out by hard beats""I guess that's what they were aiming for""! So far I only like 3 songs on the whole album and they include,track#1,track#2 and track#11,In my opinon those are the only songs On her whole album that I think might have a chance of being a top ten hit! Unless you are under the age of 18 ,Your best bet is to borrow this cd from a friend and then burn a copy of it on your computer!"
2,So young ... so ignorant,"Ah, black youth. Teairra {like so many other black females} Can't distiquish between {black men} and {n*ggaz}. Sure we look alike, but theres a difference. I'm a black man and frankly, ladies don't have to tell me anything. But {n*ggaz are like ""Toys R Us "" kids. They don't wanna grow up. They can be 30 years old and act like they're still 18. Yes ladies, you DO have to tell a n*gga how to touch you. They don't know what to do with you. You have to train em. Don't even be mad at em. Or you can get a man. But make sure you know the difference. You might not be able to handle it."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"This girl's debut album was the lamest I heard in a while! I bought it to see what the hype was all about and IT WASN'T ANY! She had no special appearances on the album! This album is for bubble gum pop/r&b for teengirls who are going through an atypical rebellious stage with their home life or having boy troubles. But if you want good music get it from somewhere else cause won't find it from this ""artist""."
2,Completely Disposable,"What was Jigga thinking? Quick Commercial Success. And he succeeded. Teairra Mari's album debuted in the top 5 on the billboard charts- pretty impressive for a teenager w/ the vocal prowess of finessed divas like: J.LO, Ashanti, and Ciara. In other words theres no substance here just a lot of fun-filler bubblegum hip-pop. Her first single ""Make Her Feel Good"" is really as good as it gets. ""No Daddy"" wont crunk up the club but it will appeal to any girl who takes pride in sassing her 6th grade teacher. Each track is equally forgettable, but if u must download something, try: ""La"" or ""Act Right"""
2,Lets hope she goes to a diff. record label....,"She has potentional. But Jay-Z and Rocafella screwed this up. REALLY BAD. Shes 19, cursing every song out, and talking how she grew up with no daddy with a club beat. nice. Rocafella should stop trying to screw up RnB CDs. I cant imagine Rells future CD...uhhhh...anyway...a few good songs but this is crap."
1,This is so sad . . .,"This ISN'T Joseph. I am his oldest daughter.If this is what music is coming to . . . then i need to make a record label . . . and get some REAL SINGERS ON IT! People, Teairra Mari has an average voice. But she sounds just like Rihanna, Ciara, Brooke Valentine, and Ashanti, who also have AVERAGE VOICES. I wish that the Music Industry would produce some REAL talent and not give someone a record deal beacuse they THINK that the person is pretty. And for the person who said Teairra Mari is 12, she's 17 (duh). And in reference to another review, I actually think that JoJo is better than Teairra Mari when it comes to vocals, but back to the point.This CD is a piece of garbage. The only songs worth listening to are ""Make Her Feel Good"" (basically for the beat and she uses the ""N"" word too much) and ""No Daddy"" (and that's only for the beat, the lyrics are stupid.)DO NOT BUY THIS CD. DOWNLOAD THE FIRST TWO SONGS ON YOUR IPOD/ MIX CD."
2,Lil Girl You Need To Grow Up,"Isnt she almost grown and she's singing about little petty middle school drama. OMG and that song about No Daddy is a mess. What in the hell do we need to hear you about being outta control because you didnt have a father figure? that is not a good excuse. It's obvious she thinks this silly song is going to attract listeners because of these tacky childish lyrics. I am so sick and tired of these type of R&B songs. Mojority of the R&B artists cannot even sing that good but these producers give them these Hip-Hop beats and that takes away from the most important thing which is the singing. There is nothing special here, it's been done a 100 times plus more everyday. A waste of money, I can be buying me some shoes."
1,Please...........,"Teairra Marí is a young up-coming artist who I thought was supposed to be like Rihanna and Ciara.....well I was wrong. This 17 year old (now 18) has 2 curse on every track! I know that kids grow up quicker these days but hey not all ""Decent"" R&B artists do that! Also the album has the vibe of ""Hating Daddy"" within which can be quite offensive 2 girls (like me) who have loving fathers.....I know a lot of kids have bastar*s of daddy's but you dont have 2 tell us about it all the time....some things may be better left unsaid....."
1,R.O.Whack,"I don't know whether the criteria for being and R&B princess has been lowered to if you look good then you can get away with it, cos this girl cant sing. It sounds like a teenager struggling with puberty. If she truly believes what 'No Daddy' claims then a lot of young women gonna end up old and alone. It aint worth copping this album wait till someone else purchases then borrow it."
2,Where is her momma?,"This child is too young to be talking about all the mature subjects she's talking about.... And who told her that it was cute to use ""the n word"" repeatedly in a song like that? With some proper direction, she could come close to being a young Monica.. ok I take that back because her voice isn't nearly as good. But seriously, she has a bit of talent, but I don't understand why she insists on cursing needlessly on songs such as ""Lala"" and why she is talking about telling a ""N*gga how to touch me"". She is only 17, and that is inappropriate. A few of the songs have nice beats, but she is a child trying to be a grown woman and it's not working. The lyrics on most of the songs are either trying too hard or just not good. Did Jay-Z really have something to do with this project? Because if this is what he calls ""A"" material then he must be losing his mind, right along with Dame Dash. Listen to this before you buy it."
3,Roc-A-Fella Records Presents Teairra Mari,I think that there are a few songs on the cd that are good. But one of my favoriates is Phone Booth because I'm 18 years old and I've been in a similar situation so I feel that she's talking about the experience that I had with my mom and my boyfriend. Today a lot of singers try to study singers like Beyonce or Alicia Keys so they can try to maintain the same amount of success that they have. Whether or not she will get that success is up to her. Everyone is trying to come up with their own but unique identity. Teairra may favor Beyonce or Ashanti by the type of song but when Ashanti came out they were saying that she was trying to be like Beyonce. I think that this cd is okay. I've purchased better but I've also purchased a lot worse and I think that for this cd she's set a standard to do better on the next one. So I'll wait and hopefully she'll blow everyone out of the water with her next cd. But if not she gave it a good shot.
1,GET A LIFE TEAIRRA,TEAIRRA NEEDS TO STOP TRYIN TO SING YOU NEED TO GET A JOB LIKE A REGULAR PERSON AND STOP SELLING YOUR BODY TO THE WORLD THAT IS THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU WENT BIG SO JUST STOP BEING A TRAMP AND DRESS LIKE A LADY IS SUPPOST TO!
1,"Get real,Teairra","First of all she is not in her 20's.Second of all she should've not worked with Jay-Z and Roc-A- fella.And lastly she is 17 years old and she should had not had a parental advisory label on it.I think singers like Rihanna,Beyonce,Keyshia Cole,Fantasia,Mary J.Blige and other singers are the best.Teairra you are the worst singer ever!I wish I can give her zero stars!!!!"
1,Rip OFF,"why dont i hear from anyones review that her hit single ""make her feel good"" samples the beat from Eric B.& Rakim's My Melody. you know the song ""check check check check out my melody"" only one review i read actually knew that it sampled Eric B. and Rakim's single. you know what i bet you everyone on the rocafella roster but Teairra Marí knew what that beat came from. if i was to ask her where it came from shed probably tell me ""sum band from the 80s"" DONT SAMPLE A SONG THAT YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE FROM. Teairra Marí GO TO HELL YOU ANNOYING bizatch! Most of you didnt even know that either. SAME ON YOU, YOU SAY YOU LIKE HIP HOP MEANWHILE YOU DIDN KNOW THAT? WHERES THE RESPECT?"
1,Listening to nothing,"You all wonder why we are referred to as B's and H's and why the real art of R&B is gone? This CD is why. People cannot get across real lyrics without using profanity and excessive sexuality. On top of that this child, yes I said it CHILD has no business singing such garbage. Where are our morals people. I would be ashamed to let my mother hear this. Is this what music is about? I don't think so and Teairra Mari you should be ashamed for selling your beautiful self short for the quick dollar because a few a years from now not one person will remember you or your wack songs."
2,Okaaay,"Teairra definitely has a voice so she gets 1 star for that, her beats are decent so she gets another star for that but that's all she's gonna get. She sings songs that are not for a little 17 year old. she sounds like a hoochie 17 year old who thinks she's gangsta. I don't know if due to the fact she's with the ROC which is why she has this attitude. She blames having no daddy why she acts so dumb. what a dumb song to write for a littel girl. Girl can sing but she needs to remain 17 and just that. She dresses slutty and she sings slutty songs. This may not be her choice but her mom should have had some input in what her daughter was singing as the album clearly is not up there in the sales department."
3,"Mediocre, at best","""Thirdly, it worked once & turned out terrific for Ashanti, but it doesn't show a sign of originality when an R&B; singer samples a hip-hop classic (Eric B. & Rakim's ""My Melody"" was used for Mari's ""Make Her Feel Good"") for his or her debut single; it also shows that contemporary R&B; is going downhill if the artists must lean against hip-hop in order to gain commercial appeal. That's sad, seeing that R&B; is what's gonna last. Rap is so corrupted with violence now-a-days that I find it hard to believe that much of will be memorable.""It's obvious from reading this that you're only 14.-Rap has lasted for 30 years, I don't see what's going stop it.-Corrupted with violence these days? Last time I checked, N.W.A is no longer making records. Today it's all about club music and being a media whore (see Diddy).-Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, et al are still remembered. If you're only referring to present day rap (ie 50 Cent) then I see your point."
1,very beautiful lady but not a good debut.....,"Teairra Mari is one of the most beautiful female singers to come out in the past 9 months.; she has a gorgeous voice and a mouth to go with it.... but this LP is not that good at all... Jay-Z could have done way better.the only songs on the LP that is good are the lead single ""make her feel good"" and ""no daddy""... the rest of the LP are lackluster cuts that sound almost the same....buyers beware: this album may not be what you all think...1.1 stars out of 5"
5,WE GETS BUSY !!!,ms Teairra Mari has just fullfiled her title as the princess of the cd she finnaly came into her own with her cd and has brought the fire that she had in her... this is a great debut and to only be 17 shes bring other female artist a run for their money .. Teairra Mari and Rhianna are taking R&B by storm... i look forward to many albums from this princess
3,Well i liked 2 songs,"(...)i chose this because i am not a customer...but this cd...i have not yet listened to all songs because from a quick run through on the cd it is not all that but i am in love with ""act right"" and ""phonebooth"" very nice songs very nice!"
1,Unexpected,"Well, when I heard Make her feel good, I thought she was gonna have a great album... i put it in and i heard the first track which was the debut song, but as the cd went on to the rest, i found that i really didn't know what i was buying. I was really disappointed with this album, and she's a lost star, because where is she out now? a couple months ago, i heard the radio dj say she was out being a bad girl, she ain't doing nothing with her voice.. i guess i expected more from her... cause jojo made ""get out"" when she was what? 14? and that was a smash, and Her entire album is Great. but teairra, she can't live up to keyshia cole.."
3,Teirra Mari,"I am nearly 14 years old but I know a lot about music. RnB is not what it used to be. When I was about younger RnB was good. Brandy, Monica, Joe,112, Jagged Edge they were all real singers not these ''gangsta wannabe can a guy make a girl feel good fools''. Don't say because of my age I don't no nothing because I do. I have all the 112 & Jagged Edge albums in my collection and I do not go out buying these crap Teirra Ciara Marques Houston rubbish. These kids need a reality check. Sure their albums are selling but are they really one of a kind. No they are not. In 5 years time no one will remember Teirra Mari and what she sang about. However people like Joe & Jon B etc will be liked for years to come . Jay Z is just intrested in money and Teirra wants to make a few bucks then she will get lost. The album has some okay tracks on it but really it isn't worth buying. Buy Donnell Jones new album ''Journey Of A Gemini'' In December."
3,Princess of the Roc,"Teairra's album was simply ""OK"". The only songs I like listening to on her CD, are the ones released (Make Her Feel Good & No Daddy). I give her props for actually BEING ABLE TO SING. If you've ever had your heart broken, or the basic ""boy problems"" you should be able to relate to a lot of her songs. A lot of people criticize her for being only 17 and singing about certain topics and curisng the way she does but hey, she's just being herself. It's a good debut for a 17 yr. old but next album..she betta step her game up!"
2,I like the daddy song,"I don't necessarily care for this album. I think she has a really foul mouth and she's disgracing teen music. Her ""dAdDy"" track is hot, but seriously, you need to be a little more emotional about that kind of song and less slutty. You're not even old enough to buy a lottery ticket!Please go wash yo mouth with soap. Because all your fans will run away if yo foul mouth continues to run. I understand the personal level of some of these tracks, but seriously, I would hate it if one of my friends made an album saying nasty foul words, have some respect."
3,Missing pieces & info,I purchased this product new last week on e'bay and am still waiting to get it up. Some of the dividers were missing. I called S & K and they will ship them. Then I realzed I would need an S & K triangle pole or adapter to install the house in my yard or the warranty would be voided. I went on line to S & K to order the adapter since I already had a pole. The material this is made from seems very flimsy but the directions say it becomes very sturdy when put together. I am still waiting to find that part out.
3,jury still out,"i was surprised by the material used to construct the purple martin house... and since this is not yet the season to place the birdhouse outside, i'm not sure how durable it will prove to be. there was mold on both the (easy to follow) directions and some of the birdhouse parts. it remains to be seen whether this affects nesting appeal."
1,"Hunk ""O""Junk","This is the worst Martin House I have ever had the misfortune to buy, If I hadn't lost my reciept it would have went straight back to the store."
5,purple martin house,We thought this house was easy to put together it took about an hour. It is plastic but very sturdy when put together. Very happy with it so far. I would recommend thia house.
5,Bought one first year now have a 2nd one!,"Quality plastic and easy to put together,easy to clean,get the starling resistant holes,buy kits its cheaper.IE:perches, tripole, hole block offs,(dividers if you want them i did not),(ground sleeve if you want to move it around,i did not).Had Martins move in the day after i put it up for rent.10 ft is the height i put mine,to allow for wind conditions.Very happy with the house and as years pass,we will see and if you want better spend 2 to 3 times as much.one reviewer got six or so years out of his or hers.I remove mine and store it inside during the off season this may prolong its life.It's a basic 12 hole house that does the job for the martins and their family.Do your research,this will help you understand what you need.Take your time and set it up as the directions suggest and most likely success will come your way."
2,Not up to par with the other volumes,"Schema Records have released a lot of good bossa-dance albums in just a few short years. This isn't one of them. The lesser acclaimed artists serve up songs that are more than a wee bit twee (Soulstance), with a few seemingly aimed to test your nerves (Les Gammas' scattered vocal ""La Vie Des Anges""). Even stalwarts Tosca and Nicola Conte offer unremarkable pieces.Thankfully, the acid lounge caper ""B & S"" by Bobby Hughes Experience dishes out some zest. Truby Trio, sharp rat-a-tat drums to the fore, whip up some energetic dance fare as well. Taken as a whole, however, Break N Bossa 3 lacks that spunk, or tres-cool chic, to match any of the other volumes."
2,Dissapointing lack of details,"I purchased this book hoping for something a little more modern than some of the older books I had read. I was dissappointed by the lack of specific detail, especially as it relates to grooming. I essentially feel it was a waste of money for any other than a complete novice. A revision could easily fix this."
4,Intriguing,"This book gives the reader a birds-eye view of the competitiveness that young professionals will inevitably face as as they weave their way through way our institutions of higher learning in search of ""self"". The romance and intrigue are just what the author promises-- spicy. And for the college-coeds who think life in college is all love, peace, and togetherness-- read the book and think again."
2,The images aren't accurate,"The socks aren't white, as shown in the picture, but have large colored bands all over them (pink and yellow). Obviously I'll live - they're just socks - but I'm disappointed and won't be using this seller ever again because I can't trust that I'll receive the item I pay for."
3,Ok game...,"I like this game. Here's why...1.)The multiplayer games rock. 2.)The guns are great. 3.)The enemy AI is funny (nothing is better to see a terrorist run away yelling, ""Grenade!"" in a foriegn language. 4.)Killing... is fun. 5.)No hit points in this..all it takes is a shot to the head or a well placed shot to the body.Things I hated about this game...1.)Bullets will won't go through doors or walls like in SWAT 3. 2.)The CT buddies of yours are on..., because they sit there like lemmings as a... blasts them all to pieces. 3.)The enemy must be made up of super snipers, because they can pull off a head shot with a pistol a 100 yards away in an instant. 4.)The guns in this game should jam after being fired 1 million times...that would've been interesting to see in the missions. 5.)The gore is weak...I shoot someone in the face with a .45 and they bleed like they just got a paper cut. 6.)Grenades in this are not realistic.It was cool at first, but multiplayer is all it's got going for it now."
2,Great game; wish it worked,"I have played this game a little bit at my friends house and loved it, so I figured what the hell. I went to the store and bought the platinum pack with all the booklets and the extra mission pack cd and everything. I get home and install it- it installs beautifully. My computer is a new p4 2.2 256 Ram with an okay video card, and that was far exceeding the box recommendations. I got into the game menu and begin the missions and right as I press the button to start the action, my computer completely shuts down. I don't know why it does it- I have well over the recommendations. Buy this game if you really hope that it will work- mine regretfully didn't."
5,One of the Best Games in the world,"This Game is grate new guns, new levels, new Guys-and Girls. Need more real itsk blood thoe. get the Game now! or your missing out an a lot."
2,Pages coming loose,The pages of the photo album have already started to come loose and it looks like the binding is not good at all.
1,Not Recommending,"The album arrived damaged. It was packaged in a thin envelope without any protective padding. The corners were bent. The pages were not what I expected either - they can fit 4x6 or 5x7, but the background and page format does not look good with 5x7 pics. I would not recommend purchasing this album."
2,"Very bright, but some light leakage","Colors are good, and it's really a light cannon, but I'm unimpressed by the light leakage. Around each corner you can see some white and colored light escaping and marring an otherwise beautiful picture. Also, the throw is pretty long even with the zoom pulled back all the way, so be sure you have enough room. The Epson Home 400 (about the same price) projects a much larger/higher quality image from the same distance, albeit less bright. Reasonable for a small cheap projector, but would not buy again."
5,Lucky Mrs. Ticklefeather,"This book arrived promptly, in mint condition. The book appeared to be in even better condition than was described by the seller. We couldn't have been more pleased with our purchase."
4,A powerful voice aptly suited for athems,"I now have this both as a tape and a CD. Steve Green has an excellent voice in the classical style, and it is aptly suited for the songs he sings. He doesn't have the vibrato of an opera singer, but he has the clear tones of a trained voice, excellent diction (you can actually understand what he's singing), etc. My favorite track is ""The Victor"": his is the best rendition I've ever heard--powerful, with an undercurrent of joy. One can tell he truly believes what he is singing without any reservations."
2,Disappointing: Tutorial exercises missing critical data,"While the layout is colourful and the content is introductory, the CD which is supposed to support active learning is missing most of the relevant materials. The CD contains demonstration versions of the software, but the Authorware tutorial, for example, cannot be used because none of the files was shipped on the CD. The copy I have (same ISBN) gives the authors as John Villamil-Casanova and Louis Molina."
2,All-Star Tennis,For a first crack the game is not bad but even compared to Super Tennis on the SNES this game is way down on the list. Nintendo easily couls have made a better product hopefully they will catch up on the next game. The playing is slow and methodical and the controls are way off. You can not hit the shots you want and at times you dive like an idiot. Definitely check it out first but personally the game just does not hit the spot. Want a good game go back to Super Tennis or ATP Tennis from the Sega Genesis
2,"Rent, but dont buy.","This is a good game to rent for about three days or so, but i bought it before even trying it out. It is a cool game for a while, but it just gets really boring after a while because it is soo unrealistic,and there are so few options. Rent it, but dont buy it"
4,Enlightening biography,"The Moslem scholar Al-Biruni was born in what is now Uzbekistan in 973 A.D. A devoted believer in Islam, al-Biruni made great advances in many areas, especially math, astronomy and the study of history. Unfortunately, much of al-Biruni's life was often at the mercy of his patrons--good and bad. The books in this series would be best used by middle-school to high-school age readers and researchers. Includes: Timeline, Glossary, For More Information, For Further Reading and Bibliography."
5,karen's surprises,"This book had more than one surprise. When I first read it as a kid I was confused about which surprise the title was actually referring to. Some of these surprises included creative ideas for a thanksgiving project(the play was chosen), karen and her brother having 2 thanksgiving dinners on the same day, karen adding 3 more self-written verses for the song in the school play that she had a hand in co writing, and her grandparents all the way from nebraska showing up on thanksgiving."
2,you get what you pay for,"The quality of the glass is good, but the image of the rose inside is a cheap color print out."
1,not so good thermometers,"The first time I used these thermometers, they worked sort of OK. The temp said the filet mignon was medium. I let the steaks rest a little and yet when I served them to my guests, the steaks were rare. The next time I used the thermometers it was on a delmonico steak. The temperature never registered correctly. The steak was well done by the time the arrow started to move on the thermometer at all. I never used the others for pork or chicken; I threw both sets of thermometers out. Yes, I had to buy 2 sets in order to be able to have enough for 4 steaks. Quite an expensive mistake (no pun inteneded). I would NOT recommend this product. Save your money and buy one universal meat thermometer that will register instantly."
1,do NOT buy these!,"purchased in a high end kitchen store, first mistake. Tried for first time on steaks, both thermometers went right to 160 lingered there a few seconds, spun counterclockwise and would not register a temp after that. the 160 was not accurate, the steaks were bloody raw inside.Now i have to try to return where purchssed on a weekend trip--miles away. could kick myself....."
4,What Is A Princess? (Disney Princess) (Step into Reading),Nice book and illustrations. I bought it to read to my 3 year old granddaughter who loves everything princess we enjoyed looking at this and reading it together.
5,These books are great,My daughter enjoys these books because they keep the story simple and she can try and figure out what the words mean. She feels like she is reading...
4,Nice early reading book,Very basic book but it highlights the most popular princesses and is great for a 4-5 year old who is ready to start reading.
2,"A leaflet, not a book...","Interesting, just a few hours to complete the reading of this small book about the first day of nuclear energy. A little bite of those years of enthusiasm and research. But, hey, it's even too short! it could have been complemented with more pictures, notes about the subsequent public reactions and maybe the involvement of the Fermi's group into Manhattan Project... or maybe with a review of existing power plants in the world. Too short."
3,Pile it on.,"Excellent and very clear. This was a feat of mind, matter and faith in themselves. Anyone interested in physics will enjoy it."
5,Love this CD,"I absolutely love this CD intitled Saints In Praise, Vol I by the L.A. Mass Choir and Congregation. So glad I found it after playing the cassette so many times it was slurred. We sang many of these songs in our Praise & Worship service in a church I atteded for 13 yrs. They really put you back to those times when Praising God ushered you into the very presence of God. I bought 2 copies and also Vol. II and III.D.B. Williams"
3,Software Falls Short,"Scanner itself functions OK. A bit of a pain trying to get the scans straight which leads to my biggest complaint. The software that comes with the scanner is really lacking alot of functionality. My flatbed software has the ability to straighten pages that are a little skewed. I have also had alot of issues with the scanned documents being seen as either corrupt or too large by 3rd party software. If I try to convert some of my scanned docs to word docs, I get this error despite the fact that the doc is a standard legal size scan. Worst yet, when I try to fax stuff that I scan with this thing while on the road, my internet faxing service also sees these docs as too large.Tired of fighting with this so I'll be selling this and going for another brand."
4,scanning my recipes,"After 30+ years of collecting recipes and never knowing exactly what is where, I decided to scan them into a computer folder, by category, and always have them at my fingertips! This little scanner is exactly what I wanted and is doing a marvelous job. Only problem I'm having with it is changing the size of the item scanned - so I scan everything in a carrier, one size - and it works out fine. Very happy."
2,Scanner not as stellar as reviews,"I purchased Pentax scanners for my employees to submit their commercial building surveys while in the field. This type of scanner is not adequate for 30-40 pages at a time. It should be used for scanning items that are much shorter in length. My employees have been having problems with the scans being light colored and can't seem to get the software to work correctly to make a pdf file that opens at the correct scale on my end. At any rate, it's fine for short scans and technically savvy end-users, but is not a miracle product."
3,works well---,"I like the ease of use, collating of pages and printing choices. Moreover, power is provided via the usb cable. It is a nice machine."
1,"Terrible software, complete waste of time","Pay over $100 to order this, wait a few days, then spent a couple of hours trying to figure out why it won't work??The engineers who created this thing should be fired. I installed the driver on MAC as well as Windows XP Professional. None worked. No signal at all. Mac driver/app won't even appear. After installation, plug it in, nothing, no blinking, and the windows ask you to ""install the scanner"". Every time I think of how much time I wasted, I wanted to throw it out of window. Now I need to return it to Amazon.Oh, called Brother support, they close at 4pm Mountain time. That's great hour. Tried to email them, they don't have the Mobile Product listed there.My recommendation? Don't buy it."
1,MacFan,"I read what seemed like hundreds of reviews so I knew I would have to download Mac software separately, etc. I didn't expect it to not work at all. After hours of trying I can't even get my Mac to recognize the scanner. The Pentax site is cryptic and completely useless to me. Mac users--unless you have a Black Belt in tech world avoid this item."
5,Truckdriver on the road,"I bought this scanner about Aug 2009 to use in truck to email my delivery invoices for payment.I have a labtop it connects to, for scanning and email. I am not really a tech guy. However I have found thiseasy to install and oh so easy to use. And at $3.00 a page to fax in my invoices from truck stops.I have saved its cost,just on fax charges. I email my invoices from most delivery locations,so I get paid for the load faster.The unit is very small and easy to store, comes with a cover that slides over it.This Pentax DS mobile 600 has worked very very well for me. If you need easy of use and a compact unit this is it."
4,Great portable scanner,It does exactly what it's made for. Good photo scans and .pdf output. It's not a flatbed so I didn't expect professional quality photo scans but it's great for scanning printed photographs developed at a drug store (photo developing shop) which usually aren't that sharp coming from our 35mm point n shoot camera.
1,Poor quality,I would have given this product a zero. The Mac driver does not work. It scans blank copies. I tried it with a PC and the scan quality was very poor. I get better quality with my flat bed Canon scanner. Do not buy it.
1,very disappointed - this is a basic scanner with no functionalities,"I bought the product to scan my business cards into outlook and my receipts into quickbooks. To make sure i was buying the right machine, i searched a lot the net and reviewed this product before buying it. Contrary to neatreceipts, i was told that the Pentax will work on both a pc and a mac.Unfortunately,when i received the machine, I discovered that this machine did not meet at all my expectations.first, the machine provides basic scanning functions. it does not integrate the business cards into outlook and the receipts into quickbooks. all what it does, it saves the cards and receipts as images in a pdf format and you can't edit themsecond, whenn i called the help desk, they had no clue how to support me which made me very nervous so i returned it and bought the neatreceipts. the new machine does perform what it promises"
1,Crash Master,I bought the scanner and returned it the following day. The thing made my system crash all the time!
4,"Mediocre Mac Support, But It'll Get You There","I am using this product on a Mac, so I had to go to their site, download the Mac-compatible TWAIN driver, install that, then find a program that I could use it in. Preview doesn't work for me, so I end up loading Photoshop just to do a scan. I usually either get a black bar at the top of my scan, or else it cuts off the top few millimeters of what I'm scanning, but you can clean that up since you're already in Photoshop.I wish there was some Mac OCR software available, and perhaps that it even had some simple direct to PDF or something just for basic needs. Obviously this isn't a ""workhorse"" scanner, so there are some assumptions that could be made.Regardless, it's a decent quality scanner, and really is tiny. I can throw this in my suitcase on business trips and know that I always have a scanner handy in case I need to scan/fax something. I really like that it's USB-powered as well, that just saves space and is really smart."
3,Easy install but really no software for Mac,"Ordering the scanner, I already knew it will be delivered without software. The Twain-Driver had to be download ed from the website of Pentax.Installation was easy. After finding out about ""Digital Images"" (have German version of OS X, it's the program icon with the photo camera) I was even able to properly scan into a small software that is called ""Combine PDF"" (http://www.monkeybreadsoftware.de/Freeware/CombinePDFs.shtml) to make one PDF out of more pages.For OCR I was able to use a version of Omnipage that came with another scanner.The scanner is easy to use very handy and delivers good scans. I suppose the price is so low because of the lacking software (therefore 3 stars only). Which I don't mind anymore for Mac, that has good tools built in."
3,Not bad - but Mac users take note,"What annoyed me most about this purchase was the fact that NO mac software comes with it at all. The driver doesn't even come on the CD that ships with the scanner. You will need to need to budget for OTHER software / shareware to make this work (DocumentWallet @ $40, Graphic Converter @ $35, Photoshop or MS-Word). Suddenly the price of the scanner becomes more expensive.I purchased this software as a replacement for a visioneer sheet fed scanner that I've had for years...The size is nice, the portability is nice, but it is *much* slower than my 6 year old Visioneer.Nice carrying case, USB fits in case nicely, whole scanner fits in laptop bag well.Pentax should step up and provide proper support."
2,Not good for newer Macs,"With a newer MacBook that came preloaded with Leopard, the current drivers from the Pentax web site almost works. But not quite. I tried scanning with the Image Capture app, and Preview, and only the edge of the paper showed. Then I tried the trial version of Word, and it (finally) asked to calibrate. I did, then scanned, and Word crashed. Subsequent scans in the Image Capture app show 1-bit color, regardless of settings. What a mess! Unlike everything else on this MacBook, it did not ""just work"". My Canon scanner, in comparison, works fine.For comparison, I installed the included drivers and tested on my old Windows 2000 desktop machine, and it all worked as advertised, though the quality was somewhat disappointing (compared to a flatbed).This doesn't qualify as ""Mac compatible"" in my book. Not returnable by the reseller, either, so buyer beware!"
4,"Great with Windows and Parallels, but Mac...","I bought the DSmobile scanner for two reasons: I wanted something that could scan just about anything for genealogy purposes, and I wanted to be able to do it on my Mac. Using the drive that Pentax had for the Mac on their website didn't work all that well. The images were very off center and of poor quality. That said, when I used Parallels and their Windows software, it worked beautifully! I was able to easily scan images and documents without any hassle and they turned out beautifully every time! I would definitely recommend this to others, so long as they don't plan on using the Mac driver to do so."
2,Poor support for Mac,"In addition to what other reviewers said (no software is provided for MacOS), I also found problems scanning from a MacBook. Changing the scan parameters (1-8 bit, color/bw/text, brightness) had no effect on the scanned document. The default parameters were off (I was unable to scan a signed document; only the printed text would show up in the captured image). I'm returning it."
1,No VISTA 64 support,No drivers for VISTA 64.The previous post to the contrary is confusing.The company site has links to VISTA 32 drivers only.If this is inaccurate please provide link to 64 bit drivers.
4,How compatable to quickbooks?,"I really have not been able to try out the product because even though it says compatable with quickbooks, you have to have an updated verson of quickbooks. I have basic 2005. You have to have quickbooks pro. I would have to spend another $100.00 to update it. I don't think I read that you have to have quickbooks pro. I wish it would have. I would have thought about it a little more before purchasing the product. I am sure the product would have been a great asset."
4,Awesome little scanner for when your in a pinch...,"I bought this scanner for traveling and work related scanning in teh field. As luck would have it I used it the day after I installed it on my computer. It functions well and the scan qulity is very good the only problem I have was getting a business card to feed straight but the software took care of that problem. It scanned the documents I needed and although it a little slow it works great. I am now free...I have a mobile office in my truck...great product, great price."
4,Compact scanner; not a fast one,"Get this scanner as something to use while traveling with a netbook or notebook computer. It's simply too slow to put up with on a desktop machine. I use it with an Asus 1000he netbook & found that it works on a USB port power suply even on full computer battery power. However, it's a pain slipping each and every page in the slot & waiting for the relatively slow scan. This scanner is for someone who really, really hates any additional weight to haul around with the notebook."
4,slim design,"Pros: small, comes with case, only one cord to connect (gets power through USB), clean scans, comes with .pdf creation softwareCons: a little tricky to get smaller things (like receipts or cards) to feed straight (but can be done with practice), still costs considerably more than basic flat bed scannersFYI: There is a b&w; card for calibrating the scanner, which it says should be done whenever using the scanner with a different computer. Something to note if you plan to switch computers a lot."
4,Good portable scanner,"This scanner is perfect for scanning documents and converting them to PDF. Scanning photos is a little more difficult. The maximum resolution is 600 DPI and the scanner is susceptible to dust collecting on the scanning mechanism causing colored streaks to appear in the photo. Besides this hindrance, photo scanning is sped up considerably over a conventional flat bed scanner. It does take some time to figure out how to efficiently crop the photos- the included software does not automatically crop photos for you- you must enter the size manually. If you have photos of various sizes, it's easier to scan photos grouped by size to get around this limitation. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase."
2,Didn't work well for me...,"I had read several of the reviews of this device, and noted some that commented on the users' difficulties in trying to get the pages to run through the scanner straight. I decided to take a chance and purchase this through gizmosforlife.I found that scanning straight was a near impossibility. It appears that there is only one roller running in the unit, so very few of my scans were completely straight. After about 30 attempts with different types of paper, and even placing the old newsletters I was scanning into a plastic sleeve, I eventually gave up and returned the unit.If the manufacturer added a second roller, I'd probably go right out and purchase the new version right away.It had a very small footprint, which I loved. My computer recognized the unit right away, and the software installed relatively quickly and with no problems."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SNOW LEOPARD!,This scanner is not compatible with Snow Leopard. I spend over an hour on the phone with manufacturer's tech support and they were unable to make it work. I tried all sorts of different drivers and it didn't work. Don't bother with scanner! Spend the extra $100 and buy Fujitsu ScanSnap S300M!
4,Pentax DSmobile 600 Scanner,Nice little unit - interface is easy to understand but it appears to limit the scanners performance and slows the whole operation down. The images are fuzzier than I expected but for the price this is a solid performer.
3,good product; cheesy packaging and support,"On first use it does a good job of scanning business documents and photographs. However, when you ask it to OCR an English document it complains because you don't have Japanese/Far East language support. If you email the email address ontheir web site the email bounces, no such domain. The device was supposed to come with a sheet protector for full size pages and does not."
4,Great portable scanner,"The Pentax DSmobile 600 is a compact little unit that works well with almost any computer. It scans very effectively and is easy to use. I was worried that it would have problems with power from USB source only, but it works just fine, even off of a hub. The process to scan pages is quicker than a flatbed, as one doesn't need to get up, remove old sheets, put in new sheets, etc. One only needs to insert the sheets, scan, and the sheet pops out of the other side, leaving the scanner ready for the next sheet to be inserted. Very nice little unit."
1,Do not buy this if you have a Mac,"This scanner was just delivered today and it was like a received a time machine to take me back to 1996. Wow do I appreciate web based software and the last 15 years of design after battling this machine for an hour and a half. I work in tech support for a technology company and I'm just walking away and returning this product. It's amazing that this exists in the same country as an iPhone.I'm still in shock, but this experience makes me realize how good we actually have it today."
1,Longevity,"Mine was great up until the point where it stopped working, 1.5 years into owning it. At first I thought it was an OS/driver issue, but I confirmed that it is simply broken. I seriously doubt I will buy from Brother/Pentax again."
1,No good! Bad Support! Would not return!,Need I say more???? BAD PRODUCT! WOULD NOT WORK! POOR SUPORT! WOULD NOT LET ME RETURN IT!
3,DSmobile 600 Scanner,Relatively easy to use scanner. Designed well and very mobile for the capabilities it was designed for.Have had product for quite some time and yet to have issues with it. Good price value ratio for those in need of mobile scanning requirements.
1,Worst Scanner Don't Waste your Money......,I bought this scanner from amazon Jan. 2010. I have had it for a year and have had nothing but problems with it. Theproduct support is horrible. It will scan a page or 2 and then mysteriously become disconnected from the computer. Ihave a HP laptop running Vista. I also tried it on a Dell Desktop running XP and had the same problems. Tech supportwas quick to tell me it was my computer. I'm very disappointed with this product...... I'm now looking for a replacement.
3,Too slow,"Very cute, taking about 30sec to scan one page. Very hard to scan a document with multiple pages."
3,You get what you pay....,"Honestly i'm kind of disappointing. After been used the neat scanner, this scanner and and the sw that came with it has just the basic function."
2,No Mac software install posible,This Scanner work on windows machine onlyCan not be installed on Mac OSX The manufacturer do not have any upgrade for MacPentax DSmobile 600 Scanner
4,A nice buy...,"This was a great buy for me. I work for the county of El Paso and every device has access codes. It is very inconvient for a contractor like myself to use office equipment. This is why I purchased a portable scanner. This scanner is light, compact, fast, and super ease to use. The software is clear and to the point. You can preview the scan as it is happening and gives you the option to rescan that particular page without altering the whole document. I can scan pictures but I haven't tried it. The only reason I did not give it 5 rating was when you feed the document sometimes it pulls the paper in a weird way and makes the scan look awkward, I gues this is why it has a rescan document feature. Another big thing was that it used the power from the laptop not a dedicated power supply. Overall I recommend it and rate it 4.75 stars. Make sure you shop around for the best price. Happy hunting."
2,Does not work with Linux.,The product description indicates that this scanner works with Linux. It doesn't at all and I can't find evidence that anyone is working on making it work. Don't buy it if you run Linux (any Linux). It even had some problems working in Windows XP.
4,Does the job as advertised.,"I bought this product to scan receipts for expense reports while traveling. Installation and calibration were straight-forward and took less than 10 minutes. The only three things on my wish list would be for the software to remember the chosen resolution for subsequent scans, a slightly larger case to more easily store the cord with the scanner, and for the ability to change the background color as, unless you place the items on paper, the background comes out black. Good choice otherwise."
5,"Wadud:Soulful,Melodic,Authentic Musicologist & WOW lyrist!","I loved this CD! It was awe-inspiring with word rhythms that stir the soul. I recommend this CD to all music lovers and supporters of ""get real"" music."
5,This cd is banging! The future of hip-hop and soul is here,"If you heard of Gil Scott you got to check out this kid. M'Shell, D'Angelo, Maxwell, Les Nubians, Wadud are all banging. This is a breath of fresh air in new music."
2,An interesting idea but not much more,This is a story of humans colonizing huge orbiting trees - an interesting and imaginative setting. But that is about all this has. The characters are poorly developed and uninspiring and a cohesive plot never seems to develop.
5,Where is the third book?,"As always, Niven's books are the best. But the third bookin the Smoke Ring series seems to be missing in action.In a reply to a letter I wrote him about 10 years ago, he said itwould be about five years before ""The Ghost Ships"" would bepublished. I have even seen an excerpt of it with that title.Where or when is it? Was the title changed?Thank Yo"
1,Larry Who??,After reading this book I realized that Larry Niven must have been killed and replaced by a pod person. It's hard to believe that this piece of inane drivel was written by the author of Ringworld. A straight description of the physics of a toroidal gas ring would have been more interesting than this book.
3,Some Brief Nudity,"The term ""orgy"" doesn't imply what we define it as today. There is a couple topless shots and some topless 'bed' scenes. Not too bad for an old dubbed movie. The film is a little grainy and the background music is cheesey. Nice looking actresses."
5,Light and easy on the elbow,"I was using forearm banding for tennis elbow for a long time. When my old racquet broke, I did an extensive research for a new racquet that provided comfort and control rather than power. I came across Head Ti.S5 and after trying a demo, the feel was so good that I took my banding off. I bought a pair and for the past month I have not had elbow or wrist pain with this racquet. (And I play tennis 4-5 times a week.) The weight is light and the frame absorbs a lot of shock and vibration upon contact. Besides comfort, the larger head size and wider string pattern allow you to generate topspin without much effort. If you are a beginner-intermediate player with slow-to-medium swing, you'll find this a comfortable and easy to handle racquet. Highly recommended."
4,"Good Racquet, but possible TOO lightweight","The ony reason I give this racquet 4*s is because it might be too light for some players. I've played for a couple of years and have started to out-grow this HEAD. It does let you get many of balls back into play, but you compromise ALOT of power. Be prepared to hit several balls longer then you want(ed)."
3,Good racquet but fragile,This is a good racquet and I enjoyed playing with it but it breaks quite easily. Mine split in half near the base a little over a year (used mostly over the summer for about 5-6 months). I'm a pretty heavy hitter but I take good care of my racquets.
1,The string is broken after one month play (I play 4 hours every week),"The string is broken after one month play (I play 4 hours every week)I need to string the racquet myself now, which cost me another 20 bucks"
5,Excellente!,"I saw the trailer and it looked pretty good so I gave it a try......and I'm so glad I did!! This movie is funny, feisty, and fast moving. Not to stereotype, but the Spanish usually find a way to have their movies end tragically (even the comedies). But not this one. I loved this movie from beginning to end. I laughed throughout and it left me feeling upbeat and happy, just as a ""romantic comedy"" should. It's definitely worth a rental or a purchase."
5,Surreal Science Fiction and Outlandish Humor Combine,"I don't recall reading an odder book than ""The Dalkey Archive"", with the possible exception of Wilson and Shea's ""Illuminatus! Trilogy"". The plot revolves around an subdued madman who is attempting to destroy the Earth, and an even more subdued protagonist, who is attempting to thwart this plan. There are, of course, inconsequential, yet infinitely hilarious subplots, for example the police inspector who slits his deputy's bicycle's tires because he's convinced that, as people ride on bicycles down bumpy country lanes, molecules are exchanged between the vehicle and the rider, thereby bestowing a sort of fiendish intelligence and humanity to the instrument and a placid nonsentience to the user, with various side effects. Also, the book forces us to ask if James Joyce really died in exile, as well as if Christian saints can be resurrected through science. As I said, quite eclectic, quite odd. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable read."
3,A flawed pastiche -- not Myles at his best,"Taken on its own, ""The Dalkey Archive"" is a funny, brilliant, innovative piece of work. But readers familiar with ""The Third Policeman"" will recognize that ""Archive"" is a bowdlerised, compromised pastiche of ""Policeman"" that Myles released after the failure of the far greater book to find a publisher. Only Mylesean scholars need pursue it -- for all other interested readers, read ""The Third Policeman"" and ignore ""The Dalkey Archive""."
1,Poor quality glue on belts for sanders! :-(,Had one on my belt sander and the glue let go after using it for 2 minutes. Figured well its been on there a while so I am going to put a new one on. That one did not last 3 minutes and the glue let go as well. They are using a very inferior glue on their products and I will not buy that again. :(
4,Interesting,"There are very few books about the Natter.This book is well written and explains all aspects of the project from its conception to its ill fated end in wartime Germany, and its life after the war as a technological grandfather of guided missiles and the space shuttle."
3,"OK, but could have been better",I'm a little disappointed in Hi-Lift Jack. Top is 2 piece and welded in the middle. Should have been one piece. They supplied a bolt rather than some sort of quick release pin to attach it. A bolt with a hand tightened nut will vibrate loose during transport. The hook on the bottom could have been a little deeper to grab onto other items other than round bumpers more securely. All in all a good add-on for your Hi-lift jack but it could have been designed a little better.
4,You better have a good bumper,Product is made well but will do a number on most factory bumpers. The stock chrome rear bumper on my '04 Dodge 2500 is quite tweeked after just one tire change. Its a good thing my bumper wasn't pristine before using this. The rolled edge on the bottom of the bumper will be straightened out some after using this unless you find a support bracket or you have a beefier aftermarket bumper.
3,I hoped for more,I was hoping for a book which helped the reader SEE the actual paintings of the masters. The particular brushstroke that made the painting interesting. The unusual shade or hue of color that made the flower come out of the painting. That sort of book. It is not. Still it has good illustrations and good information about the artists it covers.
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this book to help in our artist appreciation with my primary children in our home school. I don't have a problem with nudity in art work, and am willing to discuss and explain the reasons for nudity to my children. However, the book is overwhelmingly filled with nudity. At least twenty pages have rather large pictures of nudes and many are in seductive poses. I do not feel comfortable allowing my children to freely browse through this book and felt that the authors could have chosen different pieces of work that could have equally displayed the works of the artists."
3,Knitted Sweaters for Every Season: 4 Techniques 16 Sweaters,"This book has many innovative and challenging ideas and provides inspiration for the aspiring artist. However the yarns used are very spendy for the average budget. One has to wonder, ""Is it the pattern or the yarn which makes me want to knit this?"" Glad I bought the book through Amazon's used book sellers."
4,A very good book about State universal jurisdiction,The book explains over the legal norms that the States have which make them able to exercise jurisdicition over persons from other States.Mainly about criminal law and the problem of foreign persons being judge by a foreign State. A worth reading.
4,Kensington Laser Mouse,"The Old Mac mouse was killing my hand. This should be better.It is very responsive and fast.The clicking is easy, and the scrolling and buttons work perfectly.It fits comfortably in my hand.It could and should be heavier. (Maybe it just slips too good, doesn't seem lighter than my old mouse...?)And it won't work off my keyboard USB so it displaces another device on the main USB ( Need another D-Link hub)Beyond these two niggles it's a fine mouse. I ordered the wired on purpose because I cannot deal with even ONE more battery powered device that is basically on all the time."
1,tracking problems - mouse is hypersensitive,"the mouse sits about an inch higher than the apple mouse that comes with the Mac desktop, but I can get used to that. I have not been able to get the mouse to track properly. It twitches and drifts around, making it very difficult to point at any remotely small button. I have blown the dust out of the sensor and re adjusted the mouse controls on the Mac to no avail. Often the mouse starts working properly on start up, then rapidly gets twitchy.I havent found an online help solution yet. buyer beware."
5,great mouse for mac users,"I have used kensington mice for many years with my macs. My previous mouse, an optical one by Kensington died. I read reviews and purchased a Logitech MX400 based on the reviews. It was great, as a two button mouse, but I had not purchased it as a two button mouse. I could never get the software to work and customer service kept telling me to do the same thing.... over and over and over again and my system (a new macbook pro) was getting unstable. I returned the Logitech and bought this mouse and had it up, running and customized to my taste within 5 minutes.If you're a mac user and you want to be able to use the software that comes with the mouse, Kenisngton is the brand for you.Over all the mouse is great. I did notice that scrolling was a little slow, as another reviewer commented on, but I tweaked the software and now it is just fine."
3,"I like the design, but it's cheaply made.","I've bought two in a row already, so I do like the design and feel.However, the first one fell to pieces after 9 months (the glue holding the rubber sides peeled off).The scroll-wheel on the new one has begun to squeak (yes - it's a mouse - ha ha - not laughing).The design is great - materials are less so."
4,"Very good, not great.","Although I like the Kensington Laser Mouse very much, I find it does not scroll as fast or responsively on my Mac as other mice of this type are on other computers I have used. I don't know if that's typical of scroll-wheel mice on the Mac."
3,works,"this works, but that's about it. they're flimsy, and have absolutely no weight, maybe that is what people are looking for, but I like some weight."
3,"Good mouse, but it's still just a mouse.","Maybe I use the keyboard shortcuts too much, but this mouse was 'just a mouse' for me. The rubberized grips added no value to me. The size was much larger that I would have liked. It's performance is great. Good precision and tracking. The scroll wheel is very functional and the vertical vs horizontal scrolling ability is an excellent option. But at the end of the day, it's just a corded mouse and as such isn't anything special to me."
2,After a Quick Look,"I received the standard version, but did not know the CD has two versions; the ""Pro"" version is included as a try/ buy demo, while the standard version is primitive. Text recognition is good, but preservation of the origninal layout is poor. I was dismayed when the scan result completely dropped a column of numbers on my first trial scan, and would not pick it up unless I manually blocked the column, but then everything else was dropped. I tried a scan combining text and graphics, and the result was very garbled. The resulting file transfered well into WordPerfect, but not into MS Word, as claimed. The ""Pro"" version did somewhat better, but not to my satisfaction. I need something else. This product is supposed to recognize characters of 53 languages (especially Russian), so for some people that may be the deciding feature."
5,multiple copies,"I've had this CD for years, but now I can have a copy at home and one at work so I don't cheat the artist out of royalties."
4,A Soldier's Oath Review,"I think it was intense. There was no sexual stuff in it, which is good. The heroine is pretty persistent and gutsy."
3,Ballet Floor Barre,"This 45-minute tape is more of a warm-up and stretch tape than a conditioning workout. There are some very advanced stretches shown in this tape, so I would only recommend it for someone with a lot of flexibility.The setting is a little sterile - white walls and carpet - but there is nothing offensive about it. The instructor, Nicole Vass, has a very pleasant manner and an elegant presence.There are four sections to this floor workout - everything is done seated or lying down so no barre is needed. Section 1 warms up the body, section 2 stretches your turnout/hip joints/muscles, and sections 3/4 emphasizes over-all flexibility.This tape is a nice supplement to a ballet class or, as the instructor puts it in her beautiful Australian accent, ""for the dancer on holiday."""
5,I love this tape!,"I've been crazy about dancing since March of 99 and this has been one of my all-time favorite tapes to do at home, to get my body warmed up and feeling in shape. Nicole Vass warms up your body progressively and gradually--and safely. The tape has a section each devoted to warmup, turn-out, stretching, and cool down. I love her voice, her look, and her personality. No matter how many times I have used this tape, I don't tire of it--unlike most of the arobics tapes. :) So, congrats, Nicole, and thanks!!"
4,Highly recommended if you are looking for a stretching routine or a day off,"This video isn't very intense if you're trying to get heartpumping workout, but it is very good for people who are looking to do stretching and/or concentrate on their form.The background music is annoying and doesn't correlate with the motions.I completely agree with ""A viewer's"" review (e.g. setting sterile but not offensive, and tape is a good supplement to a more rigorous routine)"
3,Good book with lots of graphical theories,"After glancing through the few chapters of the book, I must say this is a book for anyone who is new to graphics programming as it offers lots of code samples and theories as it says on the back.If you're looking for a book about printing than this is not it, it only offers one chapter of info on it and I don't think it's all that useful (I don't program printing so I don't know)An added bonus of course is the 3D graphics chapter with topics such as ray-tracing and such. :POh and this is NOT a DirectX book, it's mainly uses the Windows API and a lot of VB code, no C here."
4,Quake II,I received the game in good condition along with a bonus game. Playing Quake II on an updated system allows you to crank up the game play quality to the max. To me it is even more fun playing it now than before.
5,Amazing Value,I have been a Duke Nukem loyalist for years. Quake II gives Duke a run for his money. My 4 yr. old plays this game up to the third level. Sometimes I forget some of those parts and he tutors me on how to get around. This game consumes my interest. Now it is available for under $1? I'm not ready to upgrade anytime soom to Wii or others....
5,Best online multiplayer game ever,"Yes this game is old..1998 I believe. However this PC classic still holds its on with the games of today..better some say. Quake 2 was the next step in the Doom/1st Person evolution and brought online multiplayer to the masses. The grahics are still superb even today. The weapons offer a perfect selection, achieve almost perfect parity with one another, and as fellow Quakers can atest are incredibly fun to use. As I heard another reviewer mention, Quake 2 can definitely steal your day or weekend before you know it. For the younger folks out there - I urge you not to turn your nose up at this one - get this game and you will be pleasantly surprised. I can promise that."
5,A must have for fans of first person shooters,"Despite what all the critics have to say, I really like Quake 2. There's just something about it that keeps me playing it over and over. The graphics are a noticeable step above the original Quake's, and the gameplay is nice and sturdy. The missions in Quake 2 have a flowing feel to them that makes you believe you are working towards something. The sound is superb with all the explosion sound effects one would expect for this type of game, and the opening music in the first level is a great mood setter for the game. The ending is a little brief, but ID has never been known for producing storylines of epic proportions anyway. Online death match play, while not up to par with some other games of the same genre, is still quite fun and adds lots of replay value. If you're a fan of first person shooters, get Quake 2 now and pick up the mission packs while they are still available."
4,A very good first-person shooter,"I love first-person shooters, but recently I've had a few disappointments. The ""Wheel of Time,"" for example, needs some well muscled computer hardware to run decently, and my computer is just too wimpy. Also, Wheel of Time features a story with cut scenes that seems to detract from the game rather than enhance it.Quake II was no disappointment, however. It runs well on my Pentium 266. Also, it's a good, old-fashioned shooter that allows the player to blast and blow up one's enemies in a way that's almost artistic. The enemies are powerful but conquerable, and the levels are interesting with pretty fair graphics.To sum, Quake II is a very good game that deserves it popularity."
2,"Great, but impossible to fix technical problem","The game is exellent! BUT After I upgraded to the worst operating system... Windows XP...The game did not work very properly anymore. Activision's technical support is pure s-. I contacted the fourms at Planetquake and I still did not got a reply from them... If you have Windows XP... YOUR OUT OF LUCK. The error you will get if you have XP is... ERROR:GAMEERROR:Function pointers have moved.That occurs when I try to load the game... So do yourself a favor and buy a old machine with Win 95, NT, or 2000 to run this game properly."
3,Not as good as the first,"I was a little disappointed in this game. I love the ambience of the first Quake, and Quake2 just doesn't have that frightening, creepy aspect. Also the first Quake is much harder. I beat this game's butt in less than 2 weeks on the HARD difficulty setting. A word of advice: after installing the game, immediately download the patch from ID software. Otherwise, games in progress will be unplayable after you install the patch. Like I said, all this and I STILL beat the game in less than 2 weeks. Friend, I'd skip this one and go for Half-Life."
3,Quake II,"Yuck! It pathatic the sequal to Quake one of the best games of all time. This one looks like a cartoon and no fun to play. The charecters look like puppets and the AI is pretty dumb. The gameplay is very dull, It is an embrassement to Quake."
1,Not the one,I had to send this watch back because it was very small and the face was barely visible.
1,bad very bad,"Cuando compre este producto me parecio bueno, al principio no tuve problemas, pero al cabo de un año los videos que grabe en estos dvd's simplemente ya no se veian los lectores de dvd no los podian leer, simplemente ""se borraron"""
1,coasters,one out of 5 stars for the one out of 5 good burns I've had with these disks (and that was only at 2x). I have Pioneer A05 4x burner. I upgraded the firmware after the first three disk could not be burned at any speed and then got one to write at 2x. Using Toast 6.0 and have had good luck with memorex 4x media (occationally need to burn at 2x but almost never a coaster). I've never seen disks which come with scratches built right in like these Ridata ones. Yikes.
2,Beware 3rd party orders,"I didn't realize when I ordered this extremely hard to find DVD that it would be coming from Europe and not be playable in my DVR - fortunately, it plays in my laptop. It's an old movie that I loved and have been looking for. However, the quality is poor - pretty much what I would have had if I had copied the VHS tape I had onto a DVD."
3,A warning..,"I've been waiting 4 years for this game and the moment it was up for sale I ordered it! But to my dismay when it got to my house I found out there are hefty system requirments...which arn't obviously listed anywhere on Amazon.com nor the creator Ubisofts page. So for those like me who don't know this game requires among other things a 3D accelorator card, 300Mhz (Pent2 or higher), and a whole lot of space..."
1,Disapointment.,"I must say, I am very unhappy with this game. I waited for years for this game, and it was not worth the money I spent on it. Although the storyline is much improved from what is was originally, I find it very difficult to move around the game and find what needs to be found for all the little puzzles to solve. I spent a full hour playing, and all I managed to accomplish was to oil the dragon and get loaded with tons of things to do. I am most unhappy."
1,Be aware of the minimum requirment for this game,"I pre-ordered this game for my daughter's birthday. It finally arrived and she is excited. But every thing ended in frustration. THe game requires a 3D video card that we don't have on our PC. This is not so obvious from the product description of Amazon's page. Without the right video card, the game will simply crash the PC. By the way, according to the UBI soft's web site, the game may not run on Window's 2000 or Window's NT."
3,More Dragonriders Please.,"The graphics and audio are excellent. I found two drawbacks:(1)controls are keyboard driven...no mouse;(2)plus having zilch capability to scan the immediate environment(panoramic camera)proved frustrating at times.However, if you are a Dragonrider's fan, this game is well worth the extra time and effort it takes to play it."
3,Not up to Pernese standards...,"I have to admit I think this game could have been better. Though it's a keeper for me simply for being anything about Pern, I have to say I was a bit dissapointed with this game, and surprised it was approved. As far as adventure games go it was okay, but as far as being associated to the Dragonriders of Pern series it was not up to snuff. It is all about a quest and never once was I able to fly my dragon to fight thread, which is what Pern is based on. I would like to have had the ability to do things from dragonback, and use my firelizard for sending messages and other things. There is so much potential for a great Dragonriders of Pern game, but sadly it was not grasped here."
4,A (somewhat disappointing) must-have for Pern fans,"Like many others, I was absolutely wild to get my hands on this game when I first heard about it, as I`ve been a Pern fan for many many years. I think the developers did a good job considering their limitations, but of course, there was absolutely no way this game could have lived up to my hopes, dreams, and expectations to be totally honest! The controls were a bit difficult, and there were some noticeable bugs, but for a die-hard Pern fan there is no way you could pass up the opportunity to be in the game. It didn`t take too long to beat, but my first time through I wasn`t able to get to all the secrets, so the opportunity to replay and re-enjoy is there. For the Pern enthusiast, this is a must-have. For the gaming enthusiast, I would rate this a `pass`."
2,Major problems,"I was really looking forward to this game and sadly I am extremely disappointed, and thats putting it mildly. Problem 1: Installing is a nightmare, tried on two machines, wouldn't run on a Pentium II, 300 mhz, finally got it to run on Pentium 4, 1.3 mgz but you can't load from desktop(it has a lock problem). Prob 2: Video and sound are are from the early 90's,very choppy (walk into walls and can't move sort of thing.) Prob 3: I am now at the point where game won't run (1 hour into it)so basically I wait for UBI to come up with patch or toss it. (I am in cave and video just freezes.) Game is linear, story line is OK, lots of those meaningless quests that have you running up and down. UBI should be ashamed, Anne McCaffrey should be totally ticked off and you shouldn't buy. Wish I hadn't. Do you ever get to ride a dragon?"
2,Ick!,"The only reason I bought this game and still own it is because it's Pern. Too bad it's so BAD! Terrible, terrible loading time, wierd voice acting, you don't get to fight Thread, and it's SLOW (story-wise). I almost fell asleep playing it. I know this is really harsh, but if you really want to play the game, BORROW someone else's copy. It's only worth buying if you're a Pern Fanatic."
1,Dont waste your money,"This game plays terrible! This game has fixed cameras so it is very easy to walk off camera. Then you have to guess which way to turn or walk to get back into camera site. At first I could not get this game to play on my computer but after ONLY 2 weeks of e-mails to their tec department and a new sound card I got it to play. Funny thing, My sound card worked fine on ALL of my other games."
5,Scott has done it again!,"A MUST-BUY & KEEP. Compared to alot of his other books, I really enjoyed this one and laugh all the way through. If you are a dilbert fan, this is one you must own. If you're not, but just looking for a good laugh, I highly recommend this collection"
5,Sometimes I feel as Scott Adams sits in my cubicle...,"The point-haired Boss is just like my REAL CEO.The consultants hired by my company are really as cynical and expensive as Dogbert...sometimes I had the feeling, Scott Adams worked in my office...Amazing!Highly recommended, at least for self-defense purposes!"
5,This is another great dilbert book along with many others.,This book is extremely funny and has the most to do with Dilbert's Pointy Haired Boss and Some other of his Co-Workers in Marketing and Management that continually prove to be Humorous and dumb.
4,Humor to hang in an office,"This is Scott Adams at his second best. Though I am a Dilbert fan (and have been since '88) I must say I don't like his reletivly recent trend towards pleasing the wage slaves. This book is a perfect example. It is very very funny but not wuite as funny as his older, more outlandish material. I liked that every few Sundays Bob would give people weggies. I liked it when Dogbert would take over various third world countries. Now it seems that all he is shooting for is something for people to tack up in there cubes. He has already done that. Get back to your wackier roots, but in the mean time this really is funny (you might just want to tack a few up!)."
2,"Nice product, but it was delivered wrong","I like the product, the stays are good, I like the finish of the product. The problem (and the reason why I'm rating it low), is that I didn't get 3 sizes, I got two pairs of the largest stays and one pair of the medium size, but no small size, and that is actually the size I use the most!Unfortunately I didn't realize of that problem until I was no longer in the States so I cannot return them now..."
1,Terrible product ....,This item was shipped and when it arrived it was shattered. The glass had spilled and I tried putting it back together but it didn't work. The metal pins are stained and I am unhappy with this purchase.
3,Glass Bottle Broken,"The collar stays are what they are, collar stays. They work fine.The reason I chose these over other ones an amazon was so I could have a nice way of storing them (I keep losing the plastic ones that come with shirts).Imagine my disappointment when I open the box, and the first thing to come out is a shard of broken glass.The metal stays were shipped inside the bottle, which was inside a small cardboard box, which was inside a larger box with thicker cardboard. There wasn't any padding or anything, so I'm not surprised the bottle was broken."
3,Doesn't Appear to be Solid Metal,"Bought these to use with magnets to keep my collars straight. The magnets are incredibly strong, but don't stick very well to these stays. So, they don't work very well.If you're just looking for solid stays, these will do the trick."
4,Does its job.,Bought these to replace the standard plastic stays that come pre-inserted. They do the job much better. For the price you can't beat it.
5,This makes a great gift!,"I got these collar stays as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend, and they are great. Some of the reviews say that are too wide or too large to fit easily into some shirts...but I did not experience that at all. They fit perfectly and easily into all of my boyfriend's shirt collars. They are very, very sturdy, classy looking, and functional. It was really nice the way Cuff Daddy packaged them also - they came in a beautiful black velvet drawstring pouch that was inside of a jewelry box. It was great for gift presentation, and it will make a great way to store them as well."
2,Expected berree quality,"The packaging id berree than the ítems. They are ok but I expected a little more quality. I wouldn't recommend this, maybe try the plastic options"
1,Metal Collar Stays Failure,"The metal stays I received from Cuff Daddy appeared to be used, the description said new. The glass tube was chipped and 2 of the 6 stays were missed. Do not order from Cuff Daddy!"
4,practical additions to any man's wardrobe,"These metallic collar stays are replacements for cheap plastic alternatives. They are virtually indestructible, do not bend under regular circumstances, and are just as heavy as needed to keep your collar in its best position.Their size is the one used by most shirts manufacturers, and most likely almost all you plastic stays will be of these dimensions.The metal used is not magnetic.For most men three pairs of collar stays (6 pcs.) are more than enough."
5,Quality Product,"It can be difficult to find collar stays, especially the non-plastic variety. These were shipped quickly and packaged very well. They came in their own pouch and were individually wrapped. The stays work very well. The metal variety works much better than the ones made of plastic. It will keep the collar down without a problem. Highly recommended."
5,"Candy Bars great, Store not so great!",These chocolate bars are awesome! I have tried to order this item 3 or 4 different times from Nutricity. Each time my order gets canceled by Amazon about 2 weeks after placed. The Nutricity never answers the email and keeps their ad up. I gave up trying to communicate with them. In my opinion you need to buy from someone else. At least you have a better shot at finding out about your order!
1,Does not do what's it's supposed to.,Don't be fooled by the cool design. This product does not keep liquids cold or hot. At most you can expect it to work for about an hour. It's got a glass lining so you need to be super careful when you wash it. The directions instruct you not to put ice cubes in it!! Are they nuts? How can you expect to keep cold drinks cold without them? Save your money. Get different brand.
1,one of the tiers is on backorder. Can't reach company,"I ordered a 3 tier serving tray. The top tier is on back order. Said it would come in 5- 9 days. That was 20 days ago. I have been unable to reach the company (My Tableware). Phone number doesn't connect, website doesn't connect."
4,Hail Christ: Divine Warrior King!,"I loved the Heliand, first and foremost, for its presentation of Christ as the Divine Warrior King. Many Christians shy away from this picture of Jesus, but it is without a doubt biblical. Is He not called the Lion of the Tribe of Judah? Will He not destroy those who oppose Him at the Battle of Armageddon? Nevertheless, the author's handling of the Gospel narrative sometimes made me feel uncomfortable. It has been awhile since I last read it, but I vaguely remember hints of syncretism. Besides this, the Heliand is an excellent epic work. To all who are attracted to the Divine Warrior motif in Scripture or who simply admire Saxon culture I highly recommend the Heliand."
3,Good movie,Good movieI truly enjoyed this movie. Everybody should get this movie. I am showing this movie to all of my freinds.
1,Major disappointment,I also chose this book because I have liked all the other Clancy books I have read. This one was a definite disappointment. None of the excitement or intrigue of his other works ..... makes me wonder if he even wrote it. Too bad. Tom Clancy is one of my favorite authors
2,Cold Case,I choose this book because I like Tom Clancy novels. Although I like Tom Clancy novels I think this one could have had more action in it instead of trying to solve an easy mystery. Perhaps if this book were more of an adult book than it would have been much more interesting.The book is mainly about a team of Net Force Explorers who find themselves in a homicide case. The only thing they have as a lead is a paper with addresses and numbers that were scratched out.IF you would like to read this book go ahead but I don't recommend it.
1,Very poor work,"I am very confused with this Clancy attempt at what it would seem as teen literature. A very dull story, almost obvious. Too boring for adults, yet confusing and truculent for kids."
1,A deep disappointment,"I was really looking forward to reading this book prior to visiting Scotland but ended up putting it down and buying a replacement. In short it is a rambling, incomplete mess. The prose wanders and rarely provides the summation to make sense of the detail provided. The focus is almost exclusively on politics and the other parts of Scottish history such as cultural and economic history are underdeveloped or just missing."
5,THE BEST POST-HITCHCOCK THRILLER OF ALL TIME!!,"A mesmerizing, cinematic work of art. The murder scene is truly classic and jolting -- Gorgeous camera work and score... The DVD transfer looks great and offers extras. Hitchcock would have been proud."
4,A Masterful & Truly Luscious Homage !,"Brian De Palma's ""Dressed To Kill"" is a stunningly beautiful homage to his most obviouse influence in meastro Alfred Hitchcock. True film junkies will find themselves picking there jaws up off the floor after witnessing the mezmorising Hitchcockian cinematogrophy that runs rampid throughout this masterful thriller. I will never fault a Director for displaying his biggest influences especially when they're of the likes of one of the four fathers of great cinema/film making. I can't say enough about this film so I'm just going to end this review now by saying that I truly am inlove with it."
3,One of De Palma's best,"Although dated in it's appearance, ""Dressed to Kill"" is an impressive film and worth owning for lovers of the thriller/suspense genre. It doesn't take long though to figure out who the killer is, but some twists along the way help keep the suspense going.Angie Dickinson and Michael Caine star in this, Brian De Palma's third movie. Angie's part is rather short, but memorable! Yes that famous shower scene is in this film ... although not really her.DVD SUMMARY:The DVD is quite impressive to say the least. All three versions of the film are included, plus some featurettes. Throw in the great widescreen version and an analysis of the rated versus the unrated, and you come up with a very generous disc. Deserves the title of Special Edition for sure."
2,How to lure others into watching porn,"It says on the box ""thriller"", so one Friday night me and my friends decide to watch it. The beginning is stupid-there is nothing but a porn opening with a bad-looking lady. Than this lady walks around for 25 minutes THEN gets killed. Then the movie is hard to follow after. I gave it two stars because of the surprise ending. The rest of the movie is compelety forgettable."
1,Item is not a working DVD,"This item needs to be refunded or returned. the DVD shows ""NOT ABLE TO PLAY IN THIS REGION."" Awaiting contact from seller. I am very upset about this."
5,One of my faves from the 80s,"I remember watching this back in the 80s when it first came out. I am (naturally) changing to dvds and wanted to add to my collection. Of course, being from the 80s, it is a bit dated, but I like the ""feel"" of the film. I like to call this the pre-cursor to ""Basic Instinct""."
4,Alot like Psycho,"But I still like it. To condemn Dressed to Kill as a Hitchcock rip-off is to miss the sheer enjoyment of this good horror/thriller movie. It plays out like a suspense film, but there is enough scare factor in to make it a horror film. This isn't for everyone though, especially NOT for Scream fans, because this film is just to intense for them. It's smothered in thickly atmospheric obsessions with sex, dread, paranoia, and voyeurism, not to mention a heavy dose of Psycho-like psychobabble about a wannabe transsexual who's compelled to slash up any attractive female who reminds him--the horror! That he's still very much a man and not a woman. Yes there is a guy wearing womens clothing in this. It's dark, and cool, so I'd get out there and buy this now! WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK!"
5,Thank you Mr.De Palma!,"Dressed to kill is one of the better thrillers ever made!Everything is perfect in this movie!Michael Caine, Nancy Allen are excellent and Angie Dickinson,Dennis Franz great!The direction is fantastic.De Palma keeps the suspense until the last moment.In this helps also Pino Donnagio's music.Angie Dickinson is a married woman suffering from erotic fantasies.Michael Caine a psychiatrist tries to help her.Dickinson cheats her husband and after she does it she's getting killed by a blonde woman!Nancy Allen,a hooker witnesses the murder and tries solving it with Caine and a policeman(Franz).I suggest you will buy this movie because it's classic and you can see it many times!"
4,Sexy Shocker,"This is a classic thriller. Like the other comments, they dont make em' like this anymore. Micheal Caine was excellent, and Nancy Allen was HOT!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,he Scariest Movie Ever,"The film could be of almost anyone who is bored with their life It is absorbing, trecherous,, realiastic, full of unexpected turns and twists. It is hard to review without giving away the surprises and shocks. It is not for little children. After the end of the film you should not be bored with any kinbd of humdrum, ordinary life and you will treasure each moment."
2,All you have to do is watch this film,"to understand exactly why it's so purely mediocre (hint: the acting. Allen and Dickinson aren't capable of better and Caine needed the bucks, apparently), or you can just read some of the ""reviews"" below that give the whole film away, and save the time."
2,Big letdown of a movie,"The first 30 minutes to Dressed to Kill are dreadful, Brian De Palma's worst ever as a director. I stuck with the movie simply because I enjoyed some of De Palma's other movies such as The Untouchables, Carlito's Way, and The Phantom of Paradise. Dressed to Kill picks up a little bit after Angie Dickinson goes away, but it never shakes off its sleaziness. This movie is overrated like its director."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Dressed to Kill is often cheesy fun (DePalma is rarely unentertaining) but it's a really pretty terrible movie that rips off/homages Psycho at a dozen different points, thinks transsexualism and multiple personalities are the same thing, wastes a nice performance by Nancy Allen and ends stupidly: rent it if you have a bunch of friends and want something campy to mock, but not for its legitimate merits."
1,"This is a Joke, Right?","I have waited at least a year to buy this DVD at an acceptable price; and now that I've finally got it and watched it, I'm in shock at how stupid this movie is. It is unbelievably amatuerish in plot, script, and acting. Perhaps, when this piece of junk first came out, it could be considered a decent film by the standards of the time. But, by today's standards, it is a complete mess. I've been had. The quality of the DVD video is a little ""off"" as well. It's not terrible, but it would help if it were remastered."
1,i guess i'm the only person on here that finds this one the PITS!!!,"this never rises above the slease and sexualy warped mind of mr. de palma. angie dickison's shower scenes are just a sick joke like the whole movie. watch a hitchcock movie if you want a good thriller,and stay away from this junk!!!"
4,Dressed to Kill,This is an old classic movie. I enjoyed the musical score. Very suspenseful! Lots of talent behind the cameras in those days.
4,De Palma Technical Genius,"Brian De Palma is a true genius at the technicalities of filmmaking, and his 1980 Hitchcockian thriller, ""Dressed to Kill,"" is very interesting. Some people think De Palma is merely an Alfred Hitchcock ripoff; he isn't. De Palma borrows elements from Hitchcock's entertaining horror film ""Psycho"" and elaborates on them with a modern theme that is all his own. ""Dressed to Kill"" is a good metaphorical work and a worthy tribute to one of the greatest directors of all time."
3,Don't make me be a bad girl again!,"There is certainly something very dark and twisted about this movie. I appreciate the fact that it doesn't need to resort to gore in order to leave you feeling disturbed. Seeing Michael Caine in a dress and wig will do the trick, no question...I found Nancy Allen's acting to be shotty - coming off terribly trite in this performance. Caine and Angie Dickinson turn in solid performances. Acting aside, though, the story is twisted and entertaining and there are some images in this film that will chill you."
2,Poor quality for an ACDelco part,"When I received the item it looks to be of poor quality. I expected better being an ACDelco labeled part. It is made in Taiwan. That said, it should work ok for my dual tank GMC diesel, but it looks cheap/flimsy."
3,Bette Davis-the Queen,"Bette Davis is at her best in this one, as the Queen of England, wooing Sir Walter Raleigh. As always, she lives up to the part, making it her own. I'm not so sure this is based, entirely, on fact. The ending seems alittle off. But it is interesting to watch Bette Davis in full form."
3,Bette 's the only good actress in this movie!,"I saw this movie after i saw ""the private lifes of elizabeth and essex""- which suprisingly isn't proposed at amazon- and which is an excellent movie. This one isn't that good, you got Joan collins instead of Olivia de Havilland and this makes the hell of a difference. If you got the choice, see ""elizabeth and essex"" first."
1,BLAH!,"This movie was a terrible dissapointment to me. After reading the reviews of this movie on numerous websites including this one, it truely sounded like a movie worth matching. I can't believe how horrible this movie is! Bette Davis has done the worst portrayal of Elizabeth the first that i have ever seen! The script is quite witty, but Bette Davis either over acts or under acts. She can't even uphold the accent for more than one line!I can't even tell you how may times a burst out laughing while watching this movie due to acting that is soo bad that some of the school plays that I have seen in the past has acting that blows this movie away.I would give this no stars if I could.Defintly do not see this movie if you are expecting a wonderful depiction of Queen Elizabeth the first, because you defintly aren't going to get it. If you want to see some good portrayals of Queen Elizabeth I, see the Elizabeth R series staring Glenda Jackson, or the more recent Elizabeth staring Cate Blanchett."
4,Killer set from the Robo era...,"This is rough and loud and in your FACE, just the way Motorhead is intended. The liner notes are nothing but ads for this ghetto record label. Definitely worth the $4 I paid for it however, and the sound is better than the bonus LIVE disc that comes with the ""Another Perfect Day"" re-issue. The drunken banter of Lemmy between songs is priceless, and Robo sounds like a razor...but the cover of the album is confusing. I see Campbell and Wurzel up there, but the interview with Lemmy (which is great, of course) at the end of the disc clearly explains the circumstances of the show...and it didn't include those two. Whatever, this is a cheap treat that any fan of Lemmy will dig."
2,This sounds like a bootleg!!!!,"I've had this album for a few years, and when I first bought it I thought it might have been a compliation of B-side live tracks.I was wrong.This is a extremely early recording of Motorhead judging from the setlist and the lineup. It is obviously a bootleg that was purchased by the record company and somehow legally released. The sound quality on this cd sucks; it was recorded on a very cheap tape deck out in the crowd most likely."
1,Best of? What a laugh.,"Best of Motorhead? Let me consider. Stone Dead Forever, Ace Of Spades, Overkill, Bomber, Orgasmatron, maybe 1916, Dead Men Tell No Tales... Considering all the great songs of Motorhead it's a damn hard job to make a selection for one CD. But this selection is a laugh. At best three of the tracks on this record belong to the best Motorhead material. The rest must be part of the ""rest"" in the title of the CD. The best thing is that there is even a Vol.2 release with this title. What a laugh! The record company should combine these two CDs under the name Collectors Only and leave the rare ""best of""-stuff."
1,Kindle Version is Not in English,"This listing shows an English translation of the book. But when I clicked on the Kindle version and downloaded it, I found I had the Italian version."
3,"Don't take 3 stars as a bad rating, really!","First I will discuss the good points about the game: Great graphics, great sound, cool looking boats and tracks,and the controls are easy to learn and use.Bad things: A lot of slowdown(espeshily in two player mode), only 13 tracks and boats,a lot of times your boat will intersect(or go through solid objects,) no different from the arcade except two player.(no added simulation or anything else to do besides just race,and it's too easy(if you didn't hear me correctly, TOO EASY)the only level I actually found hard was Venice Canals. When I beat that, I beat the game!(I've only been playing the game for 5 days.)Now that you've read my review, you can probably tell that there were more bad than good things about the game. But when I first got this game and played it, if I wrote a review then I would have given it 4 stars.I think this game is good for a rent, but I'd pass on buying it, unless you really like the game."
2,Love the arcade...,I love the arcade version! But this game does not cut it. The sound is terrible. Don't get me wrong I like the game but I would much rather play something like.... Pong! The graphics are ok but the gameplay seems too slow to be flying over the water. The game is nothing special!
2,Get's old real quick,"I bought this game basically because the commercials looked good.. I wish I would have rented it first. A friend and I went through all the courses just once (except the venice canal -twice), got first place on each one, unlocked all the courses, and boats.. we played the game for 2-3 hours. Tried just playing it to compete.. but it just wasn't fun anymore. I'm going to try to sell this game. The graphics are average, the game play is average, the game overall is average.. and too easy (regardless of what boat you use). DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE OVER 12! Go get Rippin Riders instead (snow board game, MUCH better)."
2,"Hydro Thunder, Massive Blunder","Hydro Thunder is, as typical Midway games are, a wild ride. Unfortunately, that's all you get. This game is about racing powerful boats along water canals. And you thought there was more? If you count secret passages, speedups, cheesy AI, ridiculous scenery, and a bumpy learning curve enough to call this a worthwile game, by all means run to your local store. If not, you're like me who yawned after the first half-hour. The game also has a two player mode, but it wears thin like the single player scenario. A four player option could have saved this game from sinking to the bottom of my list.CONCLUSION: Another Midway cheap thrill. Rent this first, you'll be happy you did."
1,Horrible Horrible Game,The graphics on this game are the worst. It looks like they threw it together at the last minute. Really bad. I can not stress it enough. Really bad.
3,Hydro Thunder is mindless arcade fun,"this is a great title indeed, from awsome graphics to Mindless gameplay. But be warned... it gets old quick. At first, Hydro Thunder is very fun, but after you play it for about a week, it gets old, its time to move on. hydro thunder is best suited as a rental than a buy. if your looking for mindless arcade racing with great graphics and cheap gameplay then look no further. otherwise, rent it, play it, be done with it and save your money for a better game like soul calibur or sonic adventure."
2,If N64 tresspassed onto Dreamcast.,"I remember getting Hydro Thunder when it first came out on Sega Dreamcast. Even when I had bought it new (a long time ago), I wasn't too impressed. It was okay....But not a stand out in my opinion. It was like if Daytona USA (which I think is better) was transitioned into a water racer. And for a Dreamcast game, it sure looks visually like the N64's typical graphics. The gameplay was simple controller-wise. And game-wise it was simple & repetitive. This is a game you'd get more value out of, by playing against friends. Obviously a fair amount of people would dissagree w/ my opinions. While others may have similar thought's on this title. I'd say get it if:You find it for only a couple dollars.Your in need of adding games to your Dreamcast library.Or, you have played it or a game like it...and liked it!"
3,"Little speed, little excitment","This is a good looking game, but is boring compared to other DC games. The only thing fun about is the shortcuts you can take, which are challenging to find. The boats move really slow, but I do like the terrain and graphics on it.If you are intending to use this game for a lot of two player action, do not buy this game. The boats move extremely slow in that mode"
3,You can only race three tracks,"The first three tracks are fun and there are secret passages in all the tracks to earn more boosters so you can go faster. Some of the boats are hard to steer, but the only problem you will have is you are suppose to clear the first three tracks by third place in order to open the other tracks. It is impossible to place third on two of the tracks even through the secret passages, which are also short cuts. I played this game the first time at an arcade place and I loved it. It was played so many times that all the tracks were available to race in and those other tracks were alot more fun, than the first three. After having owned this game for 5 years, these tracks are getting a little old to race over and over again."
4,Fun Arcade Stile Racing,"I was on a ski trip and we stopped in a hotel. I was bored stiff so I headed down to the Arcade. The only cool looking game was Hydro Thunder due to it's incredible action and graphics. The line was 18 kids long! All the kids playing were loving the race to the finish. I waisted 5 dollars on the incredible arcade! The tracks or fun and the vechiles were cool. Then I decided to purchase Hydro Thunder on Dreamcast. Compared to the arcade, it is not as much fun, because you don't get a steering wheel or throttle. I would recommend this game to gamers that do like racing and don't mind not having the more ""in-your-face"" action of an arcade with the steering wheel."
1,"Like seeing Kyoto on valium, but more fractured than that.","""This is despair"" is one of the recurring fragments in New Time, and ""being depressed is enhanced-- by the rim?"" is another. Some find this book full of sublime poetry, but this reader found it full of elegant, smug, and fragmentary babble; the effect is like one of seeing Kyoto on valium, but the impact is more fractured and disturbing than that. I urge this poet to work out more, to see more, to connect to other people and the world beyond her own intense solipsism in love with its own twists and terms. The cold war of the US Scalapino hothouse is over, and despair and preciosity are not enough to engage this fallen fallen world. Go back to Go on this book, or listen to Basho or Dionne Warwick for some beauty that knows more than its own same-old language gaming. ""New Time"" is not new, just repetition of the same strategies times 94 pages."
2,"Find it cheap, or forget it","I'm not sure what T. Rogers who gave two reviews is talking about. Is he even reviewing THIS book? Anyway, I'll have to agree with one reviewer. No matter how you look at it, this book had $$$$$$ on it. David Donald wrote probably the greatest biography of LINCOLN in the last 40 years. Why something so shallow and pricey as this? As ABBA would say ""money, money, money"" - David Donald has not only sold the reader short, he has sold his own ability short. Anyone that can produce some of the prior works he has on Lincoln, and then this. Hey, this book isn't that bad as a gift (which it was for me), or something in the $1.00 bargain bin, not a bad deal at all. However, don't spend your hard earned money paying $30 (insane), $10 or even $5 on this book. Its ok, but not over $1 ok. Listen, for five dollars, I'd rather be looking over my five Dollar Lincoln instead of the five dollar Lincoln book. If your ever at a $1 book sale, I recommend! If you get it as a gift read it."
5,Lincoln at Home,"I really enjoyed the book very much. It was very informational to read a personal account of his life instead of just historical facts relating to the Civil War, etc.."
3,Clever sci-fi,"This breakthrough from cult director David Cronenberg sees a tramp suddenly discover that he is a 'scanner', a person that can read and control minds. This eventually transcends into a struggle between the good scanners and the bad. Underneath this there's a neat little romantic interest which is underplayed effectively and an early version of the evils of genetic manipulation.There are some highly impressive special effects, good acting and some fantastic set pieces - especially a modern artist's studio. Although often advertised as a gore fest, it's not really too bad until the end. However, when you do reach the end, it is incredibly gory, so be warned. The ending itself is generally impressive though.Still, at the end of the day, this is impressive for its genre but it's not really my thing. If you like movies of this sort then you'll probably love this, which is remarkably fresh to say it was released during the 1970's."
5,"5 stars for a GREAT movie, 3 for No thrills DVD","Scanners is a David Cronenberg classic. It has a great story about how some of the disenfranchised of society are actually telepaths cursed with actually hearing your thoughts. These Scanners also have the horrifying ability to manipulate your bodily functions from a simple nose breed to blowing out your veins to exploding your head ( One of the 2 most famous head explosions in horror - other is Maniac ). Anyway it seems that one Scanner is vying for world domination and a security corporation wants to stop him. They seemingly recruit a homeless scanner and turn him into an agent of good versus the evil scanners. The rest of the movie I won't spoil but it is a great one. The final confrontation between good vs. evil is outstanding. Although it isn't full of gore, it does have a couple of very gory scenes so it isn't for the squeamish."
3,THIS MOVIE SCREAMS FOR A DVD RELEASE!!,"Can I get a witness!! This movie was the first David Cronenburg film I ever saw. When I saw this the first time, I was 11 and it completely enthralled me! Before this movie, I had never seen a movie with so much Twilight Zonish quality with a story that could upsell low budget movies like Halloween and Friday the 13th. I see much of Cronenburgs work has been successfully transferred to DVD, except this gem? What's up with that! I just viewed the VHS version and unfortunately, there is no widescreen version of this film. I would love to get a better sound quality version of this too. Hopefully, studios will get the hint and release a deluxe special edition of this movie on DVD with lots of extras! As far as the VHS version, it's so so. For the sake of viewing a really great piece of sci-fi, this movie is one not to pass up!"
3,"GREAT movie, BAD DVD","This is one of Cronenburg's best efforts--imaginative and very entertaining. Unfortunately, the DVD edition is not-so-hot (the stars reflect the DVD quality, not the film itself). The last forth of the movie has a terrible soundtrack matching, such that the last 20 minutes is like watching a dubbed Kung-Fu movie. I suppose I am surprised, since matching the soundtrack and visual seems like a BASIC necessity, but this sloppy redering is a mis-match. Let us hope one day someone will give this movie the right treatment (Criterion?)."
2,Bad transfer,"This movie appears to be a possible transfer from a vhs tape. The film is not clear and the color is terrible. Not much care was put in placing this movie on dvd. When there is a closeup of the cast speaking, their lips do not move with the words. I was very disappointed in the quality of this dvd. This movie is good and should have looked better on dvd. Two stars was given because it is a good movie. I have this movie on vhs, and could have saved my money by not buying the bad dvd. Save your money."
2,A Few Good Scenes,I saw this movie when I was much younger and loved it back then. Now that I am older and watching the movie I did not find it as good as I remembered. A few good scenes of exploding heads and melting faces but over all not very exciting.
2,A Mental Yawner,"David Croneberg's 1980 film about telepathic humans being recruited by government and an evil corporate defense contractor. The good telepath Cameron ( Stephen Lack) comes upon the conspiracy and seeks to do the right thing. An evil telepath named Revok ( Michael Ironside) seeks to carry out his evil plan and stop Cameron.Horrible film quality that has every trapping of a ""B"" movie. Terribly outdated and overrated. The script is dull, the story is predictable, the acting utterly mediocre, and the special effects are cheap. It's time for this movie to find its Hollywood grave."
4,They need to do a remake of this movie.,"Scanners is a great movie, you have Michael Ironside, as the suitably creepy villain and the lovely Jennifer O'Neill, oh yeah and there's that other guy. Anyhoo the actors place these mutated Canadians who can make people's noses bleed, or, if they're really torqued off, their heads explode. The movie is pretty cool but needs to be remade as the exploding heads, which were on the cutting edge of exploding-head FX technology back in the early '80s are passe and rather fake looking now. Perhaps Cronenberg could do what George Lucas did with the original Star Wars movie where he digitally cleaned up the old footage, added in some scenes and put morphing in. Still, the movie's premise is pretty good and it is vintage Cronenberg. Buy it."
2,You might need to butter your popcorn,"...with LSD in order to enjoy this movie. As many have said, the idea is interesting. Psychotic telepaths revolt against a defense contractor studying them for use as a war weapon. The story told is nonsensical, fantastic, and confusing, though. The acting is beyond the pale. The explodyhead scene is about as cool as this movie gets, I'm afraid. It's somewhat fun to watch Patrick Mcgoohan and Michael Ironside mug their way through the terrible script, I guess. The audio effects of the people talking in the scanners' heads might tempt the chemically impaired to think this movie is awwwwesome as well.Maybe if I viewed this as something of an abstraction I could have suspended my disbelief with some of the logical chasms in the film, but as a linear, plot-driven movie this was El Bombola. Cronenberg is a daring director, always willing to explore the strange and perverse, but I'd call Scanners fairly overrated for those who would rate it highly at all."
4,Serious Stuff,Scanners revolves around a bunch of humans who have acquired extraordinary telekinetic powers that can cause havoc beyond any nightmare. An evil scanner played particularly well by Michael Ironside wages a war against some normal scanners. Patrick McGoohan as leader of the Consec Scanner Insititute unveils an untouched scanner played by Stephen Lack to combat Ironside. The film made in the late 70's boasts of some very good special effects & an excellent often under rated score by Howard Shore. This film is serious stuff & director David Cronenberg scores largely due to the tight script & straight-to-the point tell-tale. People who have seen this have either loved or hated this film. You take your pick.
2,AGGHHHHH MY HEAD!,"The only thing I liked about SCANNERS is the scene where a mans head blows up. It is without a doubt one of the most realistic head blowing up scenes ever. I laughed.This is still, a very slow, dull movie and the only cronenberg film I like is THE FLY"
4,"Classic from David ""king of venereal gore"" Cronenberg","Unfortunately I cannot comment on the DVD, as I have yet to get it. Although I am happy that it is finally getting the DVD Treatment!Just saw this 1981 classic from the Cronenberg. Very scary and has some of those eecky scenes that the director is well-renowned for. I just thought after watching this film that this movie was so ahead of its time. I was born in 1981 and saw this today afternoon in 2001 and still enjoyed it immensely. Clever, gory, great score from Howard Shore (a little melodramtic at times but excusable considering the age of the film) and ""Scanners"" has Micheal Ironside in it as the most powerful Scanner of them all.There some real memorable scenes in the film especially the one in the conference room when a scanning demo goes all wrong and the last act. I have seen ""Scanner Cop,"" the spin-off of the original, and thought that film to be very good too. Highly recommended. Just not right for the squeamish...!"
3,The film that launched Cronenberg...hacked to little pieces,"As near as I can determine, we in the US have yet to GET ""Scanners"" as David Cronenberg imagined it. The version I've seen is obvious hacked half to death, a few actors have OBVIOUSLY been dubbed or badly looped, and there's just enough missing that I can't buy this is what Cronenberg wanted.Certainly his taste and developing skill are on display here. There are some very well-selected shots and clever imagery, as well as a focus on what makes the mind ""The Mind."" Of course, there's also the infamous gore; blood hounds will get their fill here, that's for sure. I don't mean to make this sound like a bad movie. It's not.I just don't think it's what Cronenberg put together. I think it's what the American distributors decided to turn it into. This is fine as it stands, but when will we get the real ""Scanners?"""
2,Not quite working for me...,"This is another one of those movies that I wasn't really looking forward to watching but my boyfriend was very insistent that I see it. I know it's meant to be on of those ""scary""/thinker/suspense movies but I ended up laughing through a good chunk of it. The acting was terrible but the music was semi-decent. I'll give it that much. Of course, I'm not an expert on this genre but Scanners just didn't click with me. The whole thing was just too predictible. The ending just added to the predictibility. If you want a classic stereotypical thinker movie, then feel free to watch it. Worst comes to worst, you laugh instead of quaking in your boots."
2,not impressed at all,"I saw this with a friend based on the fact that he said there was an exploding head scene. There definitely was and it was truly disgusting, which was nice but the movie was pretty awful all around. Like many have said the transfer from VHS to DVD was not kind to this film and at a certain point in the movie the voices are not following the mouths of the actors. The acting was pretty awful too if you ask me. I can't believe this is called an essential film by Amazon when this truly is just a rather weak attempt at science fiction. I guess it is worth seeing for the head explosion and the ending scene, but if you want to see a quality movie I would look elsewhere."
5,There is no stasis to her stunning environments....,"Quatermaine's living spaces are tangible creative thought processes one can experience physically. Sensuous light, peeling paint elevated to the status of rich silk through placement of contrasting textures, objects and forms... Her contrasts are sublime. Rich jewel colors, curvaceous script and grafitti, common objects shrouded in diaphanous veils. She lives an ever-changing landscape of exquisite beauty, revealing the connections between the mundane and the etheric. Stunning photographs!"
2,Worst abridgement ever,"I listened to the 3-disk audio CD of this work and was irritated from beginning to end. Burke dashes from one discovery to another at breakneck speed with hardly an interesting detail to pepper the narrative. In the chapter on electricity, we leap from Faraday to Coulombe to Watt to Ampere with hardly a breath in between. Unlike in Connections, in which one discovery lead almost inevitably to the next, Universe, Burke leaps from one advance o the next on the lightest gossamer thread of a connection. Even Burke's wonderful narrative voice can't rescue this mess. The order of cuts on the last disk is scrambled, as another reviewer noted. But worse, Burke's last chapter, on understanding the way our thinking bumps against prevailing paradigms, was near gibberish.Not having read the full version, I can't recommend it. But by all means stay away from this butchery!"
4,Thorough explanation,"I read this book not as a scientific work. But more likely as fantastic, story book for a child who`s hungry of knowledge. This IS a great work. It contains thorough study, information about how our world changed. But unfortunately, I don`t like the bottom line. I am a muslim, and I still feel that my religion teach not only empty theology, such as man becomes god (or the reverse?), but science as well. I kind a like the way he wrote that the Islamic world has a role too inthis world. But he didn`t state, why. Well, he is a western guy, that makes the real feeling of a muslim could not be understood. Anyway, I like this book."
4,Good service,This book was mailed directly to a friend as a gift. He reports that it arrived safely and was in good condition.
2,"Very disappointing, rambles all over without finding a point","This book was very disappointing. Its fragmented writing style reads like a 6th graders' attempt to summarize of all of European history in 5 pages or less. Instead of coherently showing how each of the eight discoveries changed human thought, it just meanders around them at random, never seeming to find the common thread."
1,Kindle FAIL! The Kindle version is a disappointing mess!,"To be clear, this review and rating is strictly about the CRAPPY transciption of the book to Kindle. James Burke's book is wonderful.The Kindle edition is full of formatting and transcription errors, and the book's illustrations and plates are rendered meaningless on my small Kindle 3 screen. I love the content of the book, but wish I had bought a hard copy instead of wasting money on the Kindle download."
4,"Good, but rables just a bit",I was introduced to James Burke through a class while in college. We read the book and saw every video in the series that went along with it. It was very interesting to see how unrelated events are connected and how things we do now were set in motion years past. It really makes you think
4,Beautiful review of how the development of science and technology changed everything!,"Watch the TV series as well. Burke's ability to connect the people, the times and driving motivations behind the ascendancy of Western science and how it then changed all areas of human life is beautifully presented. The one major flaw in the Kindle edition (not applicable to other higher rez devices like the iPod) is that all of the wonderful illustrations and photos are almost unviewable on the Kindle- zooming makes them even worse."
5,Yes indeed,As Adam Levine said on the Voice - that's some baby makin music ! If this doesn't get you some cuddle time you need to re-work your game!
2,will not fit 96-2002 dakota extended cab,this is a good product but willnot fit a 1996-2002 dodge dakota extended cab. It will only fit a club cab .
2,"Look great, if you like to be hobbled.",Bought for my husband. He's not a complainer at all. He absolutely cannot wear these shoes. In all our years this is the only pair of shoes I've seen him give up on. He tried valiantly to break them in but they just hurt.
5,Great Shoes!,Bought these Kenneth Coles two weeks ago. I am a restaurant manager and on my feet 10-16 hrs a day. I only buy Kenneth Cole shoes for work b/c they are always comfortable and built for long wear. And that's exactly what these KC's are. My feet don't hurt at the end of the day when I take my shoes off. These actually have a slight slip resistant sole on them which are perfect for me at work. I wear a suit and tie and these shoes are dressy enough.
2,"Nice shoes, but they fall apart quickly","I was pretty happy with the design and comfort of these shoes. However, the leather started falling apart on me after <1 month. As a result of this and other expereiences, I've taken to only buying Kenneth Cole shoes when they are on sale for cheap (because they really have not been lasting very long for me). I figure if I can get them for ~$70/pair, and they only last for 4 months, it's a bit like getting $200 shoes that last for a year.When Kenneth Cole improves the durability of their shoes, they will end up doing a lot better for themselves."
2,Too shiny for work,"never worn them returned them, but these are very shiny, they look like the rental shoes you would wear with a tux... the pictures are very misleading......"
2,expected more for the price,"the size is more than usual, and deformed the top of the shoe, with only 2 days of use, expecting more of the brand"
5,Classic JMT,"John Michael Talbot isn't everybody's cup of tea, but those who appreciate his meditative and worshipful style will love this CD. This is classic JMT - beautiful lyrics, melodies, and guitar passages. If you're looking for a bouncy, upbeat holiday offering, this isn't it. If you want a break from the holiday hassle and rush and seek to keep Christ at the center of Christmas, you will appreciate this beautiful CD."
5,Great Mix!,The kids all love this pancake mix. Its not too expensive for GF and the taste is great! Gotta love Kinnikinnick.
5,Best Tasting Gluten-Free Pancake Mix.,Kinnikinnick is the best tasting gluten-free pancake mix I've found on the market (and I've tried maybe 12 - 15 different pancake mix products).
4,Great Waffles,Reccommend using mineral (sparkling) water or seltzer water (not milk) for lighter more crispy waffles.
3,I image it is good - it is filled with sugar!,"This, like most other tasty gluten- dairy- free products, has sugar in the ingredients, which is fine if you can have sugar? what about a sugar free version, and let us sweeten it with our favorite non-sugar sweetner?I'd buy it and try it, but for that one little thing."
5,Great card for a good price,This card was a good deal. I've been using it in my cell phone and also using it to store documents so it fit the bill perfectly for what I was looking for.
2,Grade D,"Hard to find anything worth listening to on this cd. Although Adams sounds as though he is having fun. Skip this cd, waste of time and money."
2,Interesting more than entertaining or informative,"I came to this book having just completed Bill Bryson's ""A Walk In The Woods"" so I was disappointed that this book was so disjointed and kind of aimless.Condon seems to be a talented writer but appears to write this book as a series of marketing sound bytes rather than as a smooth narrative. This left some good observations un-explored in order to appear hip."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I read this book immediately after I read Sean's other book, The Long Drive. Overall, my opinion of this book is worse than the one before. Here he travels from one coast to the other in North America and attempts to describe his travel with humour. If you are new to his writing, you may find it humourous but after having read his earlier book, I found this rather monotonous. The part about trying to find the owner of a bible he picked up was crappy. My personal opinion is that this is a let down."
1,There is more to America than this,"A poor book this. The author and friend bum their way across America doing little but getting drunk and watching TV. It has little to offer and it is often difficult to tell fact from fiction. About a quarter of the way through the author is asked 'Will you be making any grand pronouncements or incisive observations about the country?', to which he replys 'I seriously doubt it, I'm too weak, lazy and stupid'. I thought 'well, Mr Condon, if you can't be bothered, neither can I' and put the book down. Verdict: A waste of time."
3,"Cute, but way outdated","It's amazing how quickly video games go out of date. New technology comes along and games like this -- released in 2000 I think -- seem incredibly primitive. Game play is with the keyboard, with the awkwardness to be expected of such movements. ""Puzzles"" are way too easy, even for inexperienced gamesters. It has some cute humor but the only reason to play this game would be for nostalgic value -- to remind yourself of the ""bad ol' days"" of cartoon-like adventure games.I hate being too hard on it -- it did have a refreshing humor and some nice cartoon graphics, but once you've played today's more sophisticated games, it's hard to go back to this."
2,"Mildly amusing, but useless.",Very little useful information contained in this book. You can learn more about the craft from reading her fiction!Get Stephen King's On Writing instead. Much more practical advice.
5,Beyond Genre To Literature,"This book is an excellent essay on the craft of writing, far beyond any label or genre you might want it to focus on. Honest and intelligent, Patricia Highsmith writes without flamboyance of any kind about all the steps going along the creative process. And in doing this, she really helps the writer-reader take consciousness of his craft, giving him realistic advice and motivation.""Plotting and Writing..."" is not a ""how to"" book. It doesn't give you any formula nor pretends to have found the golden way of creating a story. But it is a true infusion of shared experience from a very talented writer and a bright person.And most important: Mrs. Highsmith's book teaches there's not such a thing as ""Suspense Literature"" or whatever. As Duke Ellington said about music, there are only two kinds of literature: the good one and the bad one. Patricia Highsmith deals with the good one."
2,Mostly for Highsmith fans,"I found this book enjoyable to read, but not very useful as a practical guide. Written almost like an interview, Highsmith details the writing of her various books and short stories. If you're a fan of hers (as I am), these stories are entertaining since they show the genesis of her ideas and insights into her writing.However, it is difficult to see how many of her suggestions could be applied outside of the situation where she used them. It was almost as if she provided great anecdotes, but couldn't render general principles that would be useful in varied writing circumstances. If you're a Highsmith fan, you'll really enjoy this small book. If you're looking for general writing advice, another book might serve you better."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Like Patricia Highsmith's fiction, this book seems ill-natured. It is in no way a ""helpful manual"" for those embarked upon the scary process of learning to write publishable fiction. Instead, it is part reminiscence, but mostly self-justification. If you need to know how other people go about writing fiction, you will find a little, but only a little, of that here.Save your money. Almost any other ""book on writing"" will serve you better."
3,"A very personalized guide, with a few helpful hints","In this short book, Patricia Highsmith offers her opinions on writing suspense stories. She addresses story ideas, using personal experiences, story development and plotting, first and second drafts, revisions, and other dimensions of the writing craft. Highsmith is honest up front, stating that ""This is not a how-to-do-it handbook."" After giving writers the somewhat despairing advice that ""It is impossible to explain how a successful -- that is readable -- book is written,"" she goes on to describe her own methods, describing failures as well as successes. There are some useful hints in here, but much of the material is too personalized to be of general use. Suspense writers need a better handbook than this one."
3,More of a How-I-Did than a How-To,"As noted on the cover of the book, Highsmith is the author of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Strangers on a Train,"" both of which have been made into movies. That is not the main idea of this book though. She does mention that it requires a different kind of thinking, but she did not write the screenplays. She just mentions that some of her books were made into movies in England, American, France, and Germany.If you are picking up this book to learn how to write suspense fiction, this should not be the book. There are no things to remember and no rules. Merely, she is telling you about how she has written books. If you are very familiar with her works (not just the more famous ones), then you may be able to make this work for you. Otherwise, the book is more about her. Writers should know that you should go through a few drafts at least."
3,interesting but..,"I thought this was an interesting book, and I read all of it, but I didn't get any useful pointers about writing from it. I would recommend it to readers who just enjoy reading about writers, but it certainly isn't any kind of guide to plotting and writing."
4,I finally found an album of great surf instrumentals.,"I had been looking for a compilation of surf instrumentals and this one really does the job. It may not be a complete ""best of"" but it doesn't claim to be. I love every cut, and they all capture the spirit. Now I've gone out and bought some Dick Dale stuff too."
2,"When they say devil, they mean it...","I'm writing this review to help others know what to expect: I'm not exactly sure what I myself expected, but this book sets me off balance, unnerves me a little. These are qualities I usually like in books, but not when I read them aloud to my kids. The devils are really devils, as in satanic, as in goat-boy, fire, brimstone, in my twisted nightmares, etc, etc. Not devil as in ""oh you cute little devil"" when an actual child does something mischievous. If that's what you're after, go for it. Illustrations are fantastic. For me, too unsettling for a bedtime read aloud."
2,Older children suggested,"While the theme of this story might be a good learning lesson, I feel it is most appropriate for children 8 and above. The idea behind it and pictures might be too strong for younger children. I have 6 8 and 11 yr old children and took it to read in the classes. The 6 year old class was quiet the entire time unlike the other two classes. Also I felt after the story was read I had to explain to the classes the learned lesson behind it. I read a lot to the elementary school classes and I just did not care for this one unfortunately."
1,Not a good book for kids,I bought this book for my 5 year old granddaughter. It is too disturbing. Devils in the closet! No I'm not going to give it to her. I would not recommend this book for children. Not sure what I'll do with. It's on my bookshelf. I'll probably throw it away someday. Sorry I bought it.
1,Horrible content and illustrations!!!,"This book is completely inappropriate for children of any age. The images are too graphic and the content is completely inappropriate. Mrs. Phisto sets up ""The Devil's Playground"" in the living room as an amusement park, and the ""lake of fire"" is portrayed like a water park. If you want to thoroughly confuse your children about hell and the devil, buy this book!"
5,Great humor for us confirmed geeks,"If you are a geek like me, Explosive Cargo will at times make you laugh till milk squirts out your nose. Other times, the author is sentimental, wistful...Just plain a good read, IMHO."
5,an awesome product,"This voice recorder exceeded my expectations.I'ts very handy,small enough to fit anywere, and very easy to use.I use it for just a week and already feel like I couldn't live without it.It seem to be high quality and for this price it beats by far those high priced recorders.It's the best gadget I ever had."
1,lemon marmalade,It tasted TERRIBLE!!!! I had one taste and threw it away. Then I went and bought some lemon marmalade at Liquor Barn which was 1/4th the cost and tastes wonderful. I would take this stuff off your market list.
4,Good Read,This was an enjoyable book. You came away feeling you were there with them as they plowed the seas. What gripped me was the many submarines and so many sailors lost during the war.
5,Excellent,"I'll echo much of what has already been written. This book is an excellent account of one man's experience with WW2 submarine operations. The author made it to the level of executive officer on a sub by the end of the war (and went on to even more interesting events as told in his other book ""Surface at the Pole"").The author writes clearly, interestingly, and honestly. The author covers most of his patrols (of nine if I remember correctly) in detail and even some of his personal events while on shore. He covers everything from the horror of being depth charged to the boredom and tedium of patrol.Overall the author provides an interesting and enlightening account of US Submarine operations and what it was like to serve on a US submarine in WW2."
4,Good First Hand Account,"A good first hand account by an officer who spent his entire war in subs. Well written and appropriate for those with, or without background knowledge of the role of subs inWWII."
4,The author's honesty makes it easy to relate.,Calvert pulls no punches about about his own fear and foibles. These were men after all in those dangerous boats.
2,Reads Like a TV Documentary,"I was hoping to get a real feel for what is was like being in an attack sub in WW II. After reading the Navy Seal book titled ""Good to Go"" I was able to feel the emotion of the experience, but was unable to get that same sense from this book. I think the author really missed the boat (ha ha) in allowing such an exciting story to be told in such a factual manner. I had no trouble putting the book down. I did pick it back up later because I did enjoy the educational factor of the text. All in all this was a very weak book and I do not recommend you waste your time reading this one."
4,Shoot an Arrow,"I read this book YEARS ago and I immediately recognizedthat it was about my home town. My aunt lived in thehouse that was featured in it. I spent lots of timethere as a girl.I loaned it out to someone (?) and itWAS returned, but, a few years later I wanted to readit again and the jacket was on another book!I was sohappy to find another copy recently and found out therewas another book. Although I haven't had time to readShoot and Arrow.... I will. I loved it the first timeand I'm sure I will again......MAYBE I can figureout who the young man was. OH! I think the young man whohelped the young woman from being molested in the liverystable was my grandfather."
4,What next?,"Maybe we can get a service station attendant to write amusing anecdotes about the blunders of people trying to pump their own gas. Or a compendium of sulphur jokes as told by chemical engineers. Yeah, that would be interesting, too!"
5,This stuff rocks!!!,(. . .) This guy is dead on. We need more Windows 3.1 diual boot Linux users who do all of their good stuff in DOS!!! This man is a technical genius and I shall refer to his manuscript whenever my Internet breaks.
4,"Excellent representation of the USAF, past and present.","Walter Boyne provides a great account of the first fifty years of the USAF. From the early Army Air Force days when the US had barely enough aircraft to hold a missing man formation, to the end of the Cold War where the US won out on sheer firepower.Mr. Boyne, having flown personally is the right man for the job, due to his sometimes first hand knowledge of events he is highly credible. He addresses key events in the USAF's history, like the end of WWII, KOREA, and VIETNAM. These events make up the very essence of the USAF. He is very thorough in describing the ever changing culture and strife the USAF has gone through in the last 50 years.I highly recommend this book and frequently go back to relive the last 50 years of the greatest service this country has ever known."
3,"Fine story, serious flaws","A good sea story in the Hornblower tradition, but with unexceptional writing and publishing craft. The Berkeley paperback is full of typos, plot is linear, most characters are stereotypes, and the narrative follows an all-too-predictable formula. The book is appealing even so -- the story line never stagnates and is replete with colorful descriptions of scenery and action.These irritations didn't stop me from ordering more of the same. After all, the same things could be said of the C. S. Forester books."
3,COMMENTS BY GRAHAM JONES,FAST MOVING NOVEL. GREAT DARING SHOWN BYBOLITHO AND HIS OFFICERS. TREACHERY MUST HAVEBEEN AN ART FORM IN THOSE DAYS.
3,Adventure packed,Alexander Kent is an excellent author. The adventure sequences in his novels are the type that you just can't put down once you are emersed in the story. Unlike other adventure novels where the hero has super human powers Bolitho is genuinely human and protrays human emotions in all of the stories that I have read including Command a Kings Ship.
5,Pretty good stuff,"Check out the table of contents. There are lots of great short exerpts from philosophers and lit people. The introductions written by the editors for each article are helpful, and the authors include really good references for each of the writers covered."
5,MC Way of Wisdom,LOVE this CD of Michael Cards...it is my favorite! Esp. thought provoking for those who are experiencing difficult times in their life.
5,EXCELLENT SCI-FI MOVIE! I RECOMMEND THIS ONE!,"With the combination of the Tangerine Dream soundtrack and the movie itself, I would say this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever. The storyline is great and the depiction of the military/government reaction was right on! I enjoyed it tremendously. I would recommend it to any sci-fi fan!"
4,Fun game...,"but there are better games. This is practacly a two player only because it's much more fun that way. On one player, it's easy to beat the computer with just pushing the same button over and over and over and over and over and over and over. The price amazon is selling it at is worth it though. Purchase this only if you have a friend to play it with you."
4,Great Game,"This game has a lot of pluses to it. First off the arcade game is cool but the real fun is in the championship mode. You get to train your boxer until he is the champ of various circuits. The graphics are great too, every facial expression is clearly seen due to the power of the dreamcast."
3,FUN! at first,"This is a fun game with great multiplayer. When you play the championship mode you must defeat a bunch of people to win, then do it again and again with each person. yah it gets old but i recommend renting it."
2,aww,"ready to rumble made me laugh a lot. the music at the title screen made me press start quickly so it would stop. michael buffer is the scariest looking video game character ive ever seen. afro thunder is cool. oh yeah, the gameplay. the gameplay is weak. this game is funny for a few minutes, but after that it kinda sux."
2,review,"If you are a person that simply likes playing games with other people in multiplayer this game is perfect for you, it has funny charactors, great graphics, and a special feature where you can transport a trained boxer to another game on the VMU. If you are a person that likes games that keep you busy for a while this game is not for u it has horrible special moves and after a while it can become extremely boaring, unless your'e a hard core boxing fan which I am not.So look at what i wrote and figure out where youre personality fits in before u buy this game."
3,A great TWO-player game!,"R2R Boxing is a very fun two player game... maybe the best ""party game"" out so far for the Dreamcast. The boxers have great character, look beautiful, animate smoothly, and (most importantly) control perfectly. A five-star game, right? Wrong, because...As a one-player game, the computer's pathetic AI ruins the fun. A loss to the computer is rare, and the march through the bronze, silver, and gold (equal to easy, medium, and hard) divisions quickly becomes mind-numbingly boring. For single-players, this is a two-star game.If you know you'll often have human opposition, get this game immediately. If not, avoid... there are too many other superior one-player games out there."
3,Good game for awhile,"R2R is overall a good game the first couple of days was fun and the champion ship mode is good. But after round 15 in the silver class your charactor can not be nocked down. you can sit there and take 20 hits and loss barley any live. Maybe its a problem with the game, or the company did not intend this but after you reach that point it just gets boring. now if I play that game it is either with a friend or just lifting the weights :). The grafics are good (better then the 64) and the game play is above average. I suggest these games for multiplayer only."
3,Good but it could have been 10 time better,"The graphics will surely win over your sega-bashing friends but the gameplay needs work. You are not rewarded for getting 6 letters b/c as soon as you power up, your opponent can run away backwards. As for the the single player championship mode, it's not that good because special moves were taken out so you are limited to some really boring fights. Major dissapointment :("
5,THIS IS PURE FUN!!!,"I bought this game and really didn't get a chance to play it until I had a few friends over. It kept us playing for hours. It's graphics are great! I don't have any complaints about this game at all. In fact, you can take boxers that you train yourself to fight on other game consoles by saving them. I would say that this is a must buy!"
3,sometimes its good to just be silly....,"Haunted Honeymoon is a silly movie. If you like silly movies, its great! Wilder is silly, Radner's role is charming (=understated) and silly, and Dom Deluise steals the show in drag playing a huge eccentric old lady! What a scream! The plot is simple, the gags are predictable and it's all just silly. It's a fun movie."
3,Kid stuff?,I remember watching this movie when I was very little (I am 21 now) and I think I remember it being funny. But maybe that was because I was a kid and I haven't seen it since then.
5,Silly,"Now this would probably be categorized as cheesy but that is just fine. I love this movie. It's funny and silly and how can you go wrong with Gene Wilder, Gilda Radner and Dom DeLouise!?!? This is truly one of my all time favorite movies. If I am feeling down, I pop this in and get to really laugh. Some people may find silly, but that is the charm to it for me."
4,For collectors,"Nice classic humor , if you like the 80`s movies, probably you should deserve going to jail if you still dont get your own issue of ""haunted honeymoon""....what the heck are you waiting for ?!!!"
3,Mediocre,"Good:-the movie is abundant in humor... i was not dissapointed in the comic relief-each character had very distinct characteristics and the characters were presented in an easy-to-follow fashion... any audience member could easily depict the relationships presented from start to finish-the deception was portrayed believably... the ending is unexpectedBad:-hard to follow plot at times... confusing-although some cocepts were beleivable, the main concept that the whole movie is based on (werewolf) was unbelievable, in my opinion-the ending leaves you hanging which is annoying because the audience ends up dissapointed rather than eager to see a sequal; the ""killer/bad-guy"" is never revealed"
5,Great for closet storage.,This is great for closet organizing. Men's shoes fit in the shelf pockets with room to spare and the side pockets are an extra bonus. I plan to buy one for each of my closets. I also ordered a sweater bag but I must say I prefer this one because of the added side pockets. It is very sturdy and I had no problems setting it up.
3,Good history. Poor instruction,"I bought this for my partner when he was interested in making shoji. The information about the tradition is well written, but did not provide him with the ""how to"" he was looking for."
4,Making Shoji,This is a very comprehensive guide to make japanese screens in the traditional style.I found it useful and you can figure out the western tools needed if you dont have the Japanese tools.
5,Very intricate instructions for the mastery craft of Shoji,"This is a little more detailed than I had hoped for a son-in-law who wanted to make a Japanese lamp for their apartment. It is very involved, including the spiritual side to Shoji. A great book for the right person."
2,"Great to hear ATF again, but two BIG problems","I grew up on ATF, so I was delighted to hear them again (and I'd never heard the instrumental ""Joy"", which is cool). However, I was extremely disappointed by two things. First, three of the songs were remixed: ""Dancing in the Shadows"", ""Starflight"", and ""One Rule for You"". ""Starflight"" isn't too bad, but the other two are TERRIBLE. The originals are MUCH better. Second, how in the world can you release a Best of ATF without including ""Carry Me Home""? I love the disk because it's ATF, but a plea to Sony, echoing other reviewers: PLEASE RERELEASE THE ORIGINAL ON CD!!!!!!! I would buy it in a heartbeat. And DON'T remix anything this time."
3,a very underrated band - great songwriters,"If you're a fan of 80's synth pop, then this cd is for you. I've known about ATF since i was a kid. I recognized their talent right away and could only hope that L.A. radio would play more than just their remake of Der Kommissar. There were so many other great songs like ""Sometimes"" and ""Love will Always Make You Cry."" ATF had many catchy ""hooks,"" which remained undiscovered by those who were not lucky enough to be introduced to their music. Although the music on this cd is somewhat outdated, the feel, power, talent and melodies all remain fervent and new. I loved these guys...too bad radio didn't. It was their (radio's) loss. If any of ATF is still around, I'd love to play drums for you."
4,A Guide To Get Started,"Jorgensen is clear in his purpose for writing this book. It is to give people an introduction to the methodology of partcipant observation. He explains how the process works and gives examples to support his explanation. In the first chapter he identifies situations when the method would be appropriate: 1)little known about the phenomenon 2) different viewers between insiders and outsiders 3) outsiders having an obscured view 4) phenomenon hidden from public view. In arguing for the validity of what is discovered by researchers using the method, he writes it ""aims to provide practical and theoretical truths about human experience"" (p. 16). In my own graduate work I found this book to be helpful and recommend it to others interested in the field"
2,Inaccurate color,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This is way too green to be called teal. And it doesn't even match the image color, which would have been ideal."
4,Want to Know Why Jobs are Leaving the USA?,"This magazine prints alot of good articles, and keeps you thinking on what is really going on in the USA today. The most astonishing publications lately have been about NAFTA and the NAU.I highly recommend a one year subscription. 26 issues for only $39.00.Not bad for the price.I would also recommend subscribing to Republic Magazine as well."
2,wow.,"This item was an alright buy...I was a bit disappointed with the seller because some of the info in it was missing..so my comment on what I did receive, the book is cool but too expensive for what is inside of it. Maybe its great a discounted rate but not the regular klutz price, its not worth it."
5,Fun for kids,"This is a really fun book, I bought them for birthday gifts and the kids love them, (especially girls). My daughter has gone through two copies."
4,Excellent Texas Fiddling !!!,I recommend this cd of Texas Fiddling to everyone who really appreciates very Fine Old-Time Fiddling. As a country music fiddler myself I truly enjoyed this Legendary Texas Fiddler CD.
3,decent book,"Didn't have some of the fish we'd been catching here off the coast, but helpful just the same as we are newbies at saltwater fishing!"
1,"Not a ""field guide"" at all","This is not a field guide at all. There are no fish identification tables, etc. If you don't know the name of the fish you have (and this is why someone would want a field guide, right?) you are lost. This book is just an alphabetical listing of some saltwater fish, that's all. If you are trying to identify a fish you would have to browse page by page, hoping not to miss a picture similar (but not necessarily the same) to your fish. As someone who needed a real field guide, I can not recommend this book to anyone."
4,ken schultz's field guide to saltwater fush,"It is a really good guide. However, after I purchased it, I saw several more at a greatly reduced price, I am wondering what the difference is."
