5,Absolutely the best show on television,The writing and wit of this show is absolutely amazing and makes you keep coming back for more time and time again!
5,Best Series Ever!!!,I absolutey love this show! I purchased it for my kindle. I would look forward to getting home so I could spend the evening at Downton Abbey.
4,"Great addition to your collection, worth the money","I ordered my set the day it was released, (2 days after the broadcast of episode 5 of 9) so now I've been able to finish the season just before the broadcast of # 7 - I guess PBS thought people would buy/watch no matter what.I bought ""Original UK"", it's American DVD format so no worries there, very clear picture and excellent color too, the DVD is so clear that if you can't afford Blu ray you surely won't miss much. I think the set of ""extras"" for season 3 may be the best in the series, and worth watching even if you don't like Downton. You can even watch them first, as I did, and not really get an episode spoiled with advance details- good stuff.The stories are still at their high level of quality, the detail of the sets is amazing, great casting- better all around than just about any ""American"" television.I'm waiting for season 4 now, already planning to buy it too."
5,Downton 3,"So darn easy and available to download on my Fire, especially when I miss an episode. Smooth sailing when watching. No glitches. Bright colors and sharp features."
5,An amazing series,This is one of the best series on TV I have ever enjoyed watching. The cast is amazing and you can't wait for each episode to see how things develop both upstairs and downstairs.I hope this series continues for years!
5,What a cliffhanger,You'll love this series. It has great emotional draw. I can't believe how it ended. I will be anxiously awaiting season 4.
5,"Well Written, Produced, Directed, and Acted","This show is very entertaining and enjoyable. We all get involved in their lives, trials, and tribulations. The history is interesting too. This is one of our favorites."
5,We're hooked!,"After watching season 1 and 2 consecutively, we are hooked on season 3. We're looking forward to the rest of the season!"
5,Watched every episode,This is an excellent TV program. The writer lets us into the thoughts and lives of the Lords and Ladies as well as the downstairs staff.
5,Great series,"Obviously, the way this season ended was a bit of a downer but overall I found this season to be just as engaging as the first two."
5,Love this show,"This show is brilliant, all the seasons...love the characters and i love the historical value... love it all. Highly recommend to everyone...."
5,Downton Abbey - See This!!!!!,"Once again England is showing ""The colonies"" how to do it right.Excellent story, well scripted, with excellent dialog that makes you believe you are watching daily life at this point in time.Well Done!"
4,Downton Abbey 3rd season,"The drama continues in this 3rd season, love the actors and their characters. A little disappointed with the ending this time, but overall, a great production."
4,Show time,"Still interesting with compelling writing.New characters help.Backgrounds are lush and beautiful to look at, as are the costumes."
5,Downton Abbey Season 3,I was so excited to get this season before the entire season had been aired on PBS. The DVDs are in excellent condition.
5,Love this series,"It is so great to be able to watch a missed episode. It is available immediately. No need to worry if you miss a Sunday, you can watch as soon as the next morning. I am hooked on this series!"
5,"Good acting, good story line","What more could one ask, in this age of hollywood throwing the pretty people on screen without any acting ability, and a cliched story line. Could go into more detail on some parts, but probably good this way also, since it makes a quick resolution of ""problems."""
5,I'm hooked,I started watching this show after the 1st 2 seasons. I absolutely am hooked on it. Can't wait for Sunday nights.
5,I'm such a fan!,"It is fantastic to have season 3 several episodes before it finishing airing on PBS. This has been a sad season so far, but receiving the DVDs in perfect condition made my night a bit happier."
5,Great Show,"Love the story lines, costuming and scenic shots. This show is entertaining and fun to watch! Highly recommend to anyone!"
3,Video issues,"I love the series, but the video quality was fuzzy some times and it stopped and started many times while I was watching."
1,Best show on TV!,I was so excited to be able to watch the one episode I missed! Season 3 didn't let me down! Downton Abbey is one of the best shows on TV!
3,Downton Abbey Season 3,I have the other Seasons 1 & 2 so to see a recap was not too exciting for me. Thought that there would be more on a recap but it was more of a teaser to me than actually seeing a little something about Season 3.
3,downton abbey preview,"it piqued my curiosity, Maggie smith has always made me laugh with her delivery of her lines. Can't wait to see the new season"
1,this is a great series,"I just wanted to see the marriage, and see how they were all doing. I know I will be sorry when the series ends."
4,"Great show, not best season","Same great acting and production, but the storylines were not as enjoyable as the first two seasons. Not sure how I feel looking towards the fourth season."
4,Historical and Soapy - What's not to love.,"Love the series. The only thing about the season (spoiler alert) that gave me pause was it's pace and finale. Some of the scenarios were rushed and I felt the viewers were cheated out of some key moments. Perhaps it was the versions of the individual episodes that I saw that created the gaps, but then there was the finale which I thought was deplorable! I could think of better ways to have written Matthew off that would have involved more of cousin Isobel (a somewhat underused source of great fun and interesting entertainment). The writers took the easy way out. That was wholly disappointing, I hope season 4 is better because I really like the stories and I am very attached to the characters."
5,Loving Downton Abbey,"After viewing Seasons 1 and 2 for free on my Kindle, I have been purchasing each episode of Season 3. I thought I'd be able to catch up with the t.v. version; but I found out the UK version (which is what I've been watching) is behind the U.S. version; so now I'll have to purchase at least two more before I can start watching it on t.v."
1,sad sad sad,every time it gets too boring they make someone die! I found the episodes of this season either boring or sad
5,outstanding,First-rate entertainment and so easily purchased at a reasonable price and downloaded to & watched on my Kindle Fire. Amazon Prime is a great service.
3,Wheels come off in Season 3,"I watched and mostly enjoyed the first two seasons, and the intrigue of seeing early 20th century British culture in HD was enough to pull me through some of the painfully formulaic moments and annoying acting tics (like Cora's accent). But the period novelty starts to wear off by the middle of Season 3, as does any sense that there's an overarching plan to the writing--or at least enough to outweigh the show's business interests. Instead, the plot twists are clearly designed to keep actors they need and get rid of actors (not characters) they can't keep, and it's all too transparent to suspend disbelief anymore or to emotionally invest in the storyline (and if you can't do that, what's the point of watching?). On the bright side, having a show fall off like this gives it a form of closure, and I come out happy for the brief escape but with zero gumption to re-up my interest for Season 4."
5,GREAT!!!!,I love it so much on TV that I buy it to save on my KIndle. i HAVE BOUGHT OTHER TV SHOWS ALSO.
5,Renewed!,The second season was a disappointment. The third season renewed my interest. It was difficult not talking with friends who enjoy the show until they saw the last episode on the regular TV schedule. Now we're talking and can't wait until the next season begins.
5,"Great, great watching...","I'm hooked on this series and the players and characters. Like watching a historical soap opera, only better. Hunger for more and more."
5,Downton Abbey season 3,I just love this show. The costumes and hair styles are amazing. I would watch it everyday if I could.
5,Downton Abbey season3,loved watching all the episodes very entertaining .can't wait for the next season.I watched all 3 seasons.love love love
5,The best,This is the best soap opera of all time! Great to see how things were in the 1920's in England
1,trite and contrived end to the season,Surely Mr Fellowes has other things he can do besides killing people on Downton Abbey? The ending for season 3 makes me not want to watch this series.
3,From Drama to Melodrama,"I loved Seasons 1 and 2- I watched them over a weekend when I was sick. I found the impact of historical events we're all familiar with fairly fascinating. However, it started to get a bit far-fetched and the constant will they won't they got old. Anyway, I couldn't wait to watch Season 3, so I purchased the Season Pass. First few episodes of Season 3 were great, but then quickly turned into a soap opera and I can't say I enjoyed it nearly as much as previous seasons. I will call this Season ""Downton Abbey, 90210."" I can't say I want to watch Season 4."
2,Review is for Quality - not the show,Subtitles are WAY TOO SMALL!!! The subtitles are much smaller than that on the season 1 & 2 special edition set I bought -- even smaller than the ones on the regular TV. It seems ridiculous to spend money on something that I cannot use!
1,enjoyed until the last episode of 3,I have enjoyedDT but will watch no more after the car wreck. Just too much dying for me. It lost it's charm completely
5,Downtown Abbey,"I got hooked on first series, given to me,on my new Kindle.Its better than soaps in USA. I liked being able to see more shows,"
3,2013 set in the 1920's,"Downton Abbey is no different than any series from the Sopranos, to Mad Men, etc, that while set in a certain time period, or (as with the Sopranos) contains very non-politically correct group of characters; might as well be set in such politically correct, ""accepting"", ""tolerance"" times.In keeping with such PC times, we have homosexual relationships included that seem to be a norm in always including them nowadays, and characters doing some Obama type speech of inclusion, acceptance etc.In the 20's, Homosexuality would have been treated the same way Pedophila is treated in an unaccepting, non-tolerant way today.While plenty of comedy films in the 1920s showed buffon type White Husbands or Lord and masters so to speak, dramas did not, yet the character played by Hugh Bonneville is portrayed in such a weak manner, much like White Male husbands in dramas today are portrayed.To me, the costumes, the cars and other scenery of the period is correct, the people/characters are not"
5,Enjoy the history of it ALL.,"I can not get enough of this show. It sounded horrible when I first heard about it, but I decided to give it a chance and I truly enjoy watching the characters evolve."
5,love it,I can't wait for the next season. I wish i knew when the next season starts. I was recomend to everyone
5,Love This Show!,"I was a latecomer to this series. A friend recommended it to me. Needless to say, I watched seasons 1 & 2 in one week! Season 3 I purchased from Amazon. The show is awesome. The characters, settings and writing are fantastic. I totally recommend it to someone looking for a smart, classy show!"
5,Excellent!,"Season 3 was very well done, even better than the 2 previous seasons! I highly recommend, but start with Seasons 1 and 2."
5,GREAT series!,I hope this series can continue for many years. There are so many characters to follow and it keeps you interested all the way through. Typically fascinating British series. Glad to see Season 3 beginning in January on public television.
1,Very short,"I wanted to see a little more about the 3rd season, but this preview is very general and short. I was not impressed."
1,WHY ARE THESE DVD'S EDITED FROM THE ORIGINAL VERSION?,"To everyone out there purchasing these DVD""s. Do you know that you're being cheated and ripped off? These DVD's, all of them, all 3 seasons, have been EDITED for content. All these DVD's are missing KEY SCENES from each episode. I want to know why? I've PURCHASED these DVD's and I'm entitled to receive them and veiw them in their entirety! For example, season 3, episode 5. For those of you who already have the season 3 DVD's watch episode 5 - then re-watch episode 5 on TV if you have Exfinity On Demand. Do you see how many wonderful, decent and pertinent scenes are missing? I love Downton Abbey! I purchased the series on DVD so that I could own and watch and re-watch something wonderful. I didn't get what I paid for - a series that is UNCUT and UNEDITED. I hope I'm not the only person who is as angry and disappointed as I am. Maybe if more people voiced their outrage we might get either an answer, an apology, a replacemment, something, anything."
5,great show,I Just love this show. The home is spectacular and the cast is amazing.I Can't wait until the next installment.
4,Loved series,Loved the series but hated the ending of Season 3... way too sad. I can only hope Season 4 will be up lifting but not sure how that will be possible based on the sad ending of Season 3.
5,Loving it!!,Everything in this series is wonderful. I can't wait for the fourth season. We need to thank the family that owns that beautiful place for sharing it with us.
5,Great show!!!!,Great cast and story lines. The stories of the family and staff are well balanced. I am sorry to see some of regular actors leave the show. Let's see what happens in season 4.
5,PBS - TV's best kept secret...until now!,"I look forward to seeing each new episode. The pacing of the show, the witty dialogue, and the fantastic cast are all wonderful."
5,Excellent!,This season continues to be as good as the original. I can hardly wait for the next episode of British drama.
4,"Excellent material, streaming quality uneven","Couldn't wait to watch the last 3 episodes in regular broadcast, so I bought the season on amazon prime. Thoroughly enjoyed the show/plot line, but picture quality was frequently bad and at times stalls while the audio continues so that then there's a rapid catch up of the video."
5,High class (and low class) soap opera,"The pregnant pauses, the sidelong looks, the dowager countess are just a few of the reasons to enjoy this series."
5,Addicting,Downton Abbey is the most compelling series I have watched in a longtime. I loved it. Unfortunatelly I am now caught up and will have to wait for weekly installments.
5,Love!,"I'm not a TV watcher, but I am hooked on Downton Abbey. It's absolutely the best TV I've seen in years!!"
5,Downton Abbey Season 3 HD,I love this series!!!! I highly recommend it!!!! I watched all of season 1 & 2 in one weekend!!!! All of my friends were righ to tell me not to miss this !!! :)
5,Addiction,"My husband and I love this series, it such a great escape and a history lesson also. you won't be disappointed."
5,Downton Abbey,This show has incredible historical value. The characters and stories are unique and entertaining! My only regret is that the show is entirely too short!!
5,Love it!,"Great series - - - - - - love the characters & the story - - - - - I don't have anything else to say, do not like this minimum word requirement."
5,The Best Show on PBS,My entire family loves Downton Abbey. I can't wait for the next episode. Thomas is bad to the bone. Thanks
5,cant get enough of this saga,I can't get enough of Downton Abbey. I love this! Anxiously await the next episodes. Well worth watching over and over again.
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"I absoulutely love this show. I am hooked. When I watch, I feel like I am a part of it and find myself absorbed it. I would love to be on this show. It really sucks me in, I just want to sit and watch episode after epidose. It is FANTASTIC!!!"
5,Absolutely Addicted!,I started watching this series a few weeks ago through Amazon Prime and couldn't wait for Series 3 to begin.Needless to say I've watched it all and can't wait for Season 4 that starts filming in a couple of weeks. The cast and the story line are awesome and very believable. Watching Downton Abbey is like reading a book you can't put down.Definitely recommend!
5,Our family has found something we all love!,We enjoy the characters...history....and the fun of Downton Abbey. Though I haven't received my copy of Season 3 - we are enjoying watching it piece by piece on PBS until our copy has been released!
4,Love the show but not the charge!,"I would give Downton Abbey 5 stars but I am very upset that Amazon is now charging Prime Members to download Season 3 Episodes. Seems a bit greedy since there was no charge for the previous seasons. Now that the show is a hit, Amazon seems to be trying to reap the rewards. While $2 isn't much, it is just the principal of it. I wasn't going to pay it but was unable to download properly through PBS website and am hooked on the show! Now that I'm caught up I will just watch the weekly program."
5,They have to come back after that final episode,"I understand that this is over, but really? How can they after that series finale? This show has been the best entertainment in television that I have seen in so long. It breaks my heart to think they are all gone now. I have so looked forward to each episode; more than any other show on television.I am in mourning....."
5,Downton Abbey Marathon!!!!,This was awesome to come home from school yesterday and see this dvd in the mail!! Delivered on time so my fiance and I watched all the other episodes that havent been on TV. Let me say to those whom havent seen all of season 3 you will be pulled right into season 4 because something very tragically unthinkable happens that will leave you shocked!!!(If you thought Mrs. Sible's passing was a shocker) As a grown man watching this i cried!! BUY IT!!!!
5,Perfection in Television Viewing,"The World War I era is fascinating in itself, but when you add the drama of the impact of the changes taking place in one of England's great estates, it makes for great entertainment I couldn't stop watching until I had seen every episode of the first two seasons. Then, I couldn't wait for the third season to start to catch up, not only, with the lords and ladies of the manor, but the staff ""downstairs."""
5,GREAT SHOW,"I Love this show, I wish we could watch season 4 sooner.I cant wait to continue this series.Devoted Fan"
5,Sad Ending Season Three,I was not happy in the way that Season 3 ended but I am sure season 4 will take care of that problem Need more similiar DVD's to watch. You feel like you are part of the family in that era.
5,Downton Rocks,"That's why they call it Masterpiece Theater .. Bravo .. Costumes, sub plots, acting skills, .. Got it all .. Waiting for more"
5,Downton Abbey Series,It is unbelievably well done and mesmerizing. I can watch every episode over and over! Appeals to every gender and every age.
2,"Don't waste your money.The episodes are edited, badly.","I ended up buying this set about 2/3 of the way through the PBS run of Season 3. The fact that they are marked ""Original UK Edition"" led me to believe that these were more definitive editions than those being broadcast in the US right now, with additional footage. Nothing could be further from the truth! These have whole swaths of dialogue and even entire scenes missing as compared to the PBS episodes, often making the story less clear or reducing the impact of scenes that were set up earlier, in scenes that are now missing. These actually watch like a dumbed-down version of the Downton we know and love. I was extremely disappointed and I cannot recommend these discs to anyone unless they have no other option for watching the series. It also makes me very wary of purchasing anything from PBS's DVD label in the future, if I cannot trust them to present their shows in an unedited format."
5,Downton Purchase,"the series itself is fantastic, but the process of buying and watching on Amazon is merely ok. Netflix has a much more elegant interface, much more user friendly. That said, I figured it out without too much wasted time, and I did appreciate the ability to download. Maybe it's because Amazon sells SO many things, there is so much clutter on the screen, and it's hard to figure out where to look?"
5,Best show on TV,Downton Abbey is my favorite show! The actors and the storyline are brilliant! If your looking for good wholesome entertainment look no further! Downton has it all!
5,One of my favorite tv shows!,"Heartwarming, dramatic, and a glimpse into a lifestyle from another world and time. I love it and eagerly await more episodes."
5,I want to visit Downton Abbey,I never thought I would like a story about 1920's England but I find myself captivated and entralled with the characters and storylines.
4,Specific episodes of season 3,we are new to the streaming video concept. We were very pleased tht we could watch the episodes on our computer as well as on our smart Tv. It gave us the chance to keep up with the series by purchasing episodes that we had missed during the current run.
3,Bad story line.,"I loved the first two seasons, but I think its time to call it quits. Its getting more soap-opera like. Acting is great. Costumes are wonderful. Sets are too artificial. But store line is getting old."
5,great!,I love this show. I enjoy all the characters and all the stories. I am waiting for the next seasons to come. I wish the program would stream as it is happening.
5,I became very angry...,"After becoming so attached to these characters to the point they transcended the screen, I was angry Matthew is in the car accident at the end of this episode. The writer better make it just be an accident and not a death. If he dies...this is so unfair....to the viewers and the characters.As for the show, it is absolutely amazing..."
2,Total Disappointment! Spoiler alert!!!,"I was waiting and waiting for Season 3 and so far it's been total dissapointment...the plot is so old Edith at the church, the cancer scare, the shirts dissapear etc etc nothing new. This would not have cut it for the SAG award which they won for Season 2. Now I know why Dan Stevens ran for the hills - this will probably be the last season of Downton Abbey!"
3,From good drama to dreary soap!,"When this series started it quickly earned a well deserved reputation for a new style of period drama. It's success however has been it's undoing as the urge to keep it going long past its sell-by-date is leading it headlong down the slippery slope of ever more boring soap! This is most evident in the final ""Trip to the Highlands"" and for me it is rapidly losing its appeal despite looking better on Blu. Even the cast are fed up with it and are having to be eliminated in improbable story line twists as they say enough is enough! It is time to bring it to an end."
5,Downton Abbey season 3 is great,Beautiful in HD . Very good acting. Story is intriguing making you want the next episode to see what the characters are going to do next.
5,Downton Abbey,I got hooked on Season 1 and have continued to be entertained. Wish I lived there in that period and upstairs!
2,I received this yesterday and am having issues,"Perhaps someone can tell me if it is the disk or if it is my computer. I just received the entire Season 3 set yesterday.My computer won't recognize this disk. If Windows Media tries to open it, I get a message "" Disk is empty"". If the Blue Ray DVD software on the computer (CyberLinkPower - came with the Dell a year ago) tries to open it I get an error code and says it may not play newer movies without an update. SO I update and it doesn't see the DVD. If I use VLC media player, it says disk is empty.I don't want to watch on BluRay player simply because my husband isn't into this and that means it's in 'his domain'.I gave up and sent it back since I couldn't play this on my device(s).I'm sure of course, the CONTENT is amazing. If I could only SEE it!"
5,Why must we wait for more? LOVE IT.,"Love being able to watch Downton at our convenience, no commercials, and the whole season in one place. Now we need to get more episodes!!!"
3,childbirth is risky business no matter what the year,"This is probably the biggest tear jerker episode. Childbirth is an intense time, even in today's modern world one never knows the outcome. I look forward to the future episodes. I love PBS."
5,Downton Abbey Season 3 DVD,"I have bought ALL of the Downton Abbey DVDs on Amazon.com -- less expensive and a MUST to have for the Downton fans! My only comment, not to give away too much, is that they'd better quit killing off characters on this show or we won't have much to watch in the future!!!"
5,Downton Abbey,I first saw season one on Netflix & was so hooked that I purchased season two & three on Amazon. This is an amazing series & I can't wait for season four.
5,Awesome!,Loved every minute of it! Watched it on layovers in airports when I travelled across the country. There is no better show!
5,On the edge of my seat!,outstanding. keep it up. writing is smart. story line and characters just absorb you in to their lives. watch it.
5,Downton Abbey Season 3 (HD),Downton Abbey Season 3 carried on the traditional high quality seen in seasons 1 and 2. I am waiting anxiously for more episodes to be released.
5,"Wonderful, emotional",Loved the series. Can't anticipate what will happen. Many unexpected twists and turns and your heart and emotions are wrenched with them!
5,Quality theater in my home,"Downton Abbey is well cast, the story lines are almost always well done, and the historical fiction aspect is highly appealing!"
5,Downton Abbey,"Amazing series. I love the actors, their story lines, the costumes - everything. The show moves me more each time I watch."
4,Third Season Begins,"The beginning of married lives, the rather amazingly fast potentials for the (new) acquisitions and loss of fortunes. Love this series- characters, costumes - excellent! Two slight disappointments: I feel that Violet meeting her match in Martha Levinson (Mary's American mother), casts her a bit out of character- it's not like her to not have the last word! I'm guessing her philosophy has transitioned to"" better to hold the tongue (depriving others of some wonderfully sarcastic wit) than erring on the side of American vulgarity. Mary's sweet countenance is beginning to wear a little thin- hope to see a little more develop from her."
5,"Fabulous, smart, TV",It is so refreshing to have such an interesting and intelligent TV program to look forward to. This series renews my faith in the media.
5,hoooked!,i'm hooked and watched season 1 & 2 in one weekend. one of the best dramatic series i've watched. it's a must see!
5,Downton Abbey Addict,Very well written!....moves at a steady pace! The Acting is superb and is easily the best drama on television today!..........Take A trip to Downton..... you won't be sorry.....Five stars all around!
4,Downton Abbey Season 3,I thoroughly enjoy watching the relationships between the servants and the main family. I do get a bit disappointed when a story of a character begins to grow interesting but then is dropped to leave me wondering what is happening wth that character. I was taken completely by surprised by this season's ending ( I won't mention it here since I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has yet to view this third season). I can't imagine the show without this character but then again it will keep me intrigue until the new season begins.
4,Getting soapier,"I have been following the ups and downs of the Crawleys and their servants since day 1. The production values and the acting are tremendous.Inevitably, though, the script has to descend into soap from time to time to retain interest. Before this series the return of Matthew in the middle of the concert in the second series had been the soapiest but the last moments of the new series are pure soap. I'll watch and buy the fourth series but with a perhaps more critical eye on the exigencies of the script.Still a great effort by the team."
3,Writing this season is down the tubes!,"My boyfriend at I both ADORED seasons 1 and 2. Something about this season so far has felt rushed and messy. The delicate, balanced, nuanced dialogue has given way to obvious, over-the-top soapy-ness. Let's hope it redeems itself before the end!K"
1,Streaming issues...,"I know that this show can be streamed from free from the pbs.org website, but I got tired of the loading breaks, so I purchased it from amazon. STILL has issues! I can't even get it to stream - quite literally getting a streaming error on Amazon. I've tried other shows (hulu is working great) - needless to say I'm quite disappointed with amazon and frustrated that I paid for a free show and had so many issues."
5,Love this Show,We just discover this series and so happy we could order the earlier shows. We have had Abbey viewing parties. Just got this and can not wait to watch the 3rd series with our Abbey fan friends .
5,I'm a big fan!,"I found Downton Abbey in a Roku search for classic British drama and/or PBS series. Because I don't receive an standard network or cable TV, I had no idea it was a current series. Very reminiscent of the classic ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" series, I fell in love immediately and was disappointed when the available episodes were at an end. Am watching each new episode as it comes available on Roku and am still delighted with the series. I think I was born in the wrong country and the wrong era. LOL"
4,Spoilers!! Unbelievable!!!,"When you're reviewing a book, you don't give away the ending. The same courtesy should obviously be given to other kinds of ""stories."" I can't believe how many reviewers on here have thought it appropriate to share major plot developments of Season 3, including what happens in the very last scene of the season. Luckily I just watched the season finale and came here to see if the DVD set includes the Christmas episode. But many won't have seen any of the episodes. Please show some common sense and courtesy. Think of this when doing future reviews. If you've included spoilers here, you might consider removing your review."
5,BEST SHOW ON TV!!,"I'm not a big TV fan, especially with the drivel they have on these days, but this is THEE BEST SHOW out there. I can not say enough good things about it. My wife and I have watched the first season 5 or 6 times. I am constantly in awe at how well the story flows, how great the actors are, the advancement of the plot in each show. The only complaint I have is that the season is only 9 episodes! ONLY 9!! There should be 90!! But past that this show is so VERY much worth watching.. OK, I lied, I have other complaints about the show, Season 3 is HARD to deal with. The changes to the family and the loss of members has weighed heavily on my wife and I. We LOVE each and every character and to have some ripped away like that is horrid. We've got an emotional investment in these people. Perhaps I'm too invested in what is essentially a hyped up soap opera, but it's such a well made soap opera!!!! GET THIS SERIES!! You'll not regret it!!"
5,Must see,"Absolutely love this show. Takes you into a different place in time. Beautiful scenery and clothing. It shows the differences between the family upstairs and the family downstairs and the troubles that each face. Once you start watching, you can't stop!!"
5,Couldn't stop watching!,Finally watched this series and hooked. I can't wait to see Season 3. Last few minutes of Season 2 final episode made me bawl.
4,But was very dissapointed with the ending!!!,"Because of the ending I'm not sure how I will like season 4. Oh, I will watch it but really how good could it be without Mathew??? Too many characters dying....Thinking they must have something big in store as I'm sure I'm not the only fan dissapointed."
2,does not match content quality of the TV video episode per episode,"we were so excited to get the video we watched all in one sitting and came away both sad and with somewhat disappointment in some of the definite gaps. it was even more clear when we tuned into PBS on sunday the following weekends and rewatched the first and continuing episodes week after week, it was almost like it was two different versions of Downton Abbey season 3. i feel like we havent got the right version that we paid for . this one was a ""carnival "" product would that have been the difference ? we would like to send it back , is that possible ?"
5,Downton Abbey,"This is a well done, well acted piece and a look into aristocratic life before and after the war. It is funny, witty and surprising."
5,Wonderful,"A bit of history, a bit of romance-- the shows expose human nature with all its flaws--This is great escapism."
5,Downton Abbey season 3,"The US edition of DA Season 3 (original UK edition) is 3 disks, 526 minutes which includes in addition to the 9 episodes the 2012 Christmas in the Highlands as well as interview with Shirley MacLaine and some other behind the scenes specials. Amazon offers the best price (PBS offers $39.99), an even better deal if free shipping. I can't wait until this arrives the end of January! After football season this will keep us occupied for some time! Just thought I would share this info."
1,Beware of Amazon cutting scenes from Downton Abbey!,"I love Downton Abbey and I have downloaded the first two seasons and the first three episodes of the 3rd season to my Kindle. Season 3, episode 3 has several crucial scenes deleted! It is over 4 minutes shorter than the PBS broadcast and the storyline is disjointed because of the missing scenes. Now I wonder if all the Amazon downloads are missing some scenes! I am very disappointed in Amazon for advertizing that it is the ""original UK "" episode, when clearly it is not."
5,Downton Abbey Season 3,I have seen Season 1 and 2 and I am sure I will enjoy 3 just as much as we did the first the other seasons.
4,We want more,"Sorry to see that the role of Mathew will not be renewed.Robert , in character will really miss him"
2,Disappointed,Too many blank spaces in this version. Was very disappointment in the english version. Cannot understand how the American version is so different
4,"Not as riveting as first two episodes, except for season end.","Although expecting a cliffhanger at end of season, was not expecting Matthew's demise. Not happy with that ending at all,"
2,Episode 6 was the worst,"I'm done with Downton Abbey. Episode 6 ended my like for the show.1. They shouldnt take scripture out of context (he who is without sin shouldnt cast the first stone)He says that but at the same time he (Lord Grantham) is contradicting himself by saying homosexuality is a sin. But in the next breath says he was born that way.Which one is it? That's nothing more than confussion. If you want to condone sin, dont use the Bible to do it.2. If God made people homosexual he wouldnt call it an abomination (Lev 20:13)If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood [shall be] upon them."""
2,Direct stream doesn't work well,"While episode itself is magnificent, it had stopped at least 6-7 times during my viewing and I had to re-start it all over again. Instead of 1 hour, it took me 2 and a half hours to finish."
4,Love it,Love this show! Highly addictive and entertaining. Dame Maggie Smith is superb !! Love Shirley McClaine's guest role. The old girl still has it! Scene stealer her and Dame Maggie!!
4,hope it's worth it. (spoiler),"What ever it is that actor Dan Stevens decided to pursue instead of Downton, I sincerely hope that it is as wonderful in equal measure to the heartbreak millions of viewers experienced in losing the character Matthew Crawley. I was saddened by the loss of Lady Sybil when Jessica Brown Findlay packed her bags, but it was a minor blow. Losing Matthew felt as though I received a horse kick to the chest.His character was the voice of reason among all the petty jealousies and outdated pretensions. The only redeeming quality of Lady Mary was her husband. Hopefully the skilled writers of this series will be able to recover without making a maudlin mess or a breezy glossing over of a major plot upset. I am interested to watch season four for just these reasons,but something of the magic of Downton Abbey died along with Matthew Crawley."
4,lots of twists and turns,Great Writing And Great Acting. I Am Hooked And I have Watched All 3 Seasons So Far. Every Season There Are New Characters And Plot Gets Really Interesting.
5,Beautiful Show!,"One of the best shows on TV. Beautifully acted, directed and produced! I am a fan of british drama and period pieces and I absolutely love it."
3,i kept waiting...,This series never really came alive for me. One of a small handful of sympathetic character got killed in the end in a similar way that Meg Ryan got killed in the City of Angels. What was the point?
4,I love it,My wife made me watch it and now I'm hooked. My daughter is now hooked and she has my Ipad and won't give it back until she catches up on the seasons.
5,Wonderful Show - Deep and Rich,Complex and lush plot. Understated yet colorful presentation makes this a wonderful series showing the caste system of England as it decayed at the beginning of the 20th Century.
4,The fun continues,"Love season three! The plots thicken even more (though some characters start to get a little tiresome, ahem), and the fantastic costume and set design is better than ever. The cast is clearly at the top of their game. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Love this show!,"Great story! Great cast. Great writing. If you enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, you will also love season 3. Can't wait for the rest!"
4,Better and Better!,"I think it is one of the best period shows on television,the costumes and house could carry the show on their own.But the casting and acting is dead on! Maggie Smithscharacter has the best one-liners! I love it!"
5,Love Downton,"Delicious to look at, I enjoyed Season 3 quite a bit. I felt a little off when I watched the first episode, like I had missed some material since the end of S2, but still enjoyable. The last episode was a bit off, it fell into the category of day time soap opera sometimes. We'll see how the cliff hanger turns out next season I guess!"
3,The streaming quality.,The streaming quality even on Amazons own player was very poor.It will be a while before I purchase another instant video.
5,Downton Abbey love love this series,Am hopelessly addicted to this show.Great cast and great show. watched season 1 and 2 in less than 1 week
4,Still great,"Not quite up to season 1, but still great television. If only the aristocracy had really been like this. If only life was so cooperative."
5,Look forward to watching every week!,"Great British drama that has me hanging on for the next episode. Great acting, realistic set and design and wonderful writing and plot. A must see."
4,Sorry ending :0/,Loved season 3 Just didn't like when he died on the day the baby was born need more happiness! Sister needs to stop picking wrong men!!!
5,"Once you begin this series you cannot leave without seeing the whole lot. Wonderful acting, great story lines, sublime setting","Once you begin this series you cannot leave it alone. Wonderful acting, great story lines, sublime setting. Very highly recommended."
5,Bravo!,I love everything about this show. Best drama on television. The characters are so complex. The acting is superb. It's been a long time since I've seen anything this good.
2,Mere Hype,"This kinda documentary look at the vampire/ goth scene has quite a bit of girl- girl kissing and some scenes of nudity. I wouldn't recommend it. The box descrpition made it out to be a cult film, but I've seen a lot better."
3,Interesting perspective,Intresting perspective. It makes you wonder just who may be floating amongst the wana be's
3,"Vampire Diaries, Not What To Expect?","If you're looking for some gore, and frightening images, then this isn't the movie. You don't see her fangs and nor do you suspect shes pregnant.Exotic lesbien scenes,The real vampire named Vicky, who's pregnant,hunting for blood. Betrayle,love who hangs with Holly and her wanna be vampire friends. No one is safe, and the wana be's start dying. Point I didn't get at all. Vicky gets captured and her baby stays with Holly.I give this movie 2 1/2 stars; But since there's no 2 1/2 stars; 3 will have to do.But like i said watch it for yourself and then decide."
2,Disappointing,"I didn't care for the author's writing style, which was overly verbose and prose-heavy. The author set out to answer a question, mainly to assuage his own guilt in leaving Israel (he is a 9th generation Israeli!): what draws people to move to Israel and settle there permanently, especially people living in affluent America? While each of the 3 stories profiled were fairly interesting, he did not answer this question convincingly."
3,Solid but Too Academic,"These performances are not to my taste. I prefer the more romantic interpretations of Sawallisch with the Dresden Staatskapelle even if they are ""less authentic"": the hermeneutic of Shubert Symphonies, rather than the exegesis. I would argue music should be hermeneutical rather than exegetical, but that is another matter. I have placed my copy of the Complete Symphonies of Schubert with Harnoncourt and the Royal Concertgebouw up for sale."
3,Works for now,"I just changed over to using a badger hair brush from using shaving cream from a can. This tree works and does the job. I think I will upgrade over time, but it does what I need it to do."
4,"great value, just wish it was a bit taller","This is a great product, keeps your brush bristles-down so it dries properly. My only reason for 4 and note five stars is my wish it was a tad taller to accommodate larger brushes. Other than that it's a great bang for the buck."
4,Brush stand,"At first I thought it was a lot of money for a piece of metal. But it is perfect, and my husband likes it."
2,Why does this cost so much?,"This does the job. The job is to be a piece of metal with little arms to hold a shaving brush. That's a really easy job, is there any reason it should cost so much money?Yes, the reason is that there is not a cheaper little bit of metal that holds a shaving brush to be found on Amazon. So we're stuck.Decent product, terrible price."
2,"Its ok, but too expensive.","I'm having a bit of 'buyers remorse' from this purchase. I only got it because I've switched to shaving with a blade and the brush requires a stand to let it dry correctly. BUT, there's no reason this thing should cost $15+ dollars...$2.50 would be more like it!"
3,"Simple, does what it was designed for...","So far, so good. May not hold large brushes in a stable manner. Also, I will watch for rust formation as this may stain a non-stone or non-sealed counter (not marble, granite, etc). No rust so far. Letting your brush dry out should greatly extend its life, so having a brush stand is pertinent. Again, you get what you pay for so the stand was a bargain. If buying a heavier or larger brush, may want to consider a stand such as the wooden one sold on Amazon.com."
5,Fits the bill,"I am not sure any one is better than the other, but based on price and style I went with this stand for my shaving brush. It does what it is supposed to and does not take up too much space doing it. If you are going to invest in a decent shaving brush go ahead and spend a little money on a stand too."
3,As we predicted,"Although I do like this CD and the dreamy beauty of Schwarzkopf's voice, there is nothing that goes beyond one's expectations. Her voice is in top shape and Szell does a fine job in supporting her, but the overall effect is a little static. The ecstatic high-lying phrases through out do not truly soar, and therefore the ecstasy is contained. There is little spontaneity, and to truly savor this CD, one must love Schwarzkopf's arch manner and fussy inflections. I just happen to love her gorgeous tone."
5,The voice of an angel,"For many people, Jessye Norman's rendition of Strauss's Four Last Songs is the best, and while it is true she invests enormous depth and power into her performance, there is no reason whatsoever to overlook this utter gem - not just for the Last Four Songs but also for the 12 Orchestral songs.Schwarzkopf possessed a soprano voice of supreme beauty and poise. Never over the top and always in complete control she does perfect justice to Richard Strauss's masterpieces. What also elevates this to a classic recording is Georg Szell's superb orchestra which is exquisitely and sensitevely pitched to Schwarzkopf's lovely, warm tone.Despite the odd (inexplicably) dissenting voice among these reviews, this is a truly special recording and one that any Richard Strauss fan would be out of their minds to ignore."
5,a heavenly voice for this heavenly music,"When I bought this record, I think it was 1999, the man in the recordshop selected 3 versions for me. After hearing the 1st (this one) I said: "" Just leave the others"".It is still one of my best classical CD's."
4,people submitting bad reviews for different products,"""Therefore, the Toshiba 36HF73 36"" Flat-Screen HD TV is not defective and we will not be able to offer further assistance or allow the TV to be returned for a refund. ""a) This is NOT the 36 inch, it is the 32.b) ALL 4x3 tubes will have some bowtie effect on widescreen films, and before buying I looked at all in the class and the Toshiba 32 had the LEAST!c) you are reviewing the 36 and placing the review in the 32. 3"" in a tube set is at the very limits of consumer engineering for tubes. when looking at a widescreen film on a 36' tube, even the best in its class like the toshiba, you are the most likely to get a bowtie. read any information on the variety of choices, ie: largest tube (36"") plus widescreen film = bowtie."
3,"Some helpful tips, but otherwise rather weak","This book appears to be a recycling of the book ""Premiere to Go."" While it does have some useful tips and advice from someone who is experienced in the field of video, overall it isn't very useful. It is poorly written and jumps from very basic topics to some highly advanced topics that really only apply to professionals. At the time I wrote this review, there were dozens of these books available for under a buck in the New and Used section. That is how I bought mine, and I wouldn't suggest paying any more."
1,Absolutely horrible!!!,"Ok, this was the WORST book I've ever tried to read. Yes, that's right, ""tried"" to read. I didn't finish it because I couldn't get beyond Chapter 5 and I finally just gave up!! Good thing it was cheap. Do NOT waste your time."
1,Wish I could give it a zero,"Country music. Come on. We are from the Steel City, not the south. Where did we go wrong????"
1,Marginal,"Not much useful, cohesive information here. More like a hodge-podge of scattered ""hints"". I found it to be of little practical use. Suggest Balena's book on VB 6 instead. Pass on this one!"
1,DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When i got this right away i noticed the sound quality was not as good as my last cd player. Second off all, it says anti-skip but it doesn't help at all, i could have bought another cd player for this so it is not worth the value. Third, is that it is not durable. I dropped it from a foot off the ground on carpet and the sound went bogus. When you change the sound it would scratch and be very obnoxious. And last, recently the clip that keeps it close just broke off very easily. So after this i tried to get my warranty but it was only 10 days. You had to buy an additional warranty before that one expired. I am disapointed with this product."
2,Das Whinegold,"Well, I have the real version of it. This is only parts of the real version. It is good to listen to something like this before hand to decide wether you like it or not. Maybe I'm in the wrong place to curtique but I say that this version is my sixth favorite (out of six). EVERYONE is not in the right cast."
2,WARNING!,"Well, this was a pretty nice tripod. It fit all of my needs. But, I have several cameras & lenses, therefore I would be needing a couple extra quick release shoes. While an extra shoe costs about $7-$12 for most tripods. The only place I could find and extra shoe was Sony and they wanted $55.This one is going back to the store. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
5,The best independent cd ever,There's many new artists coming out every year and well one reason why Tyler is going to be BIG this year is because he's one talented guy. From these tracks you can find out how much talent Tyler has. Lyrically the album is really good and the overall performance of the songs is amazingly good. Who knew at such an early age that Tyler would make great music? So you guys should definately buy this CD now.
5,Tyler Hilton's music,I bought tyler's cd after I met him. He's incredibly down to earth. When I met him I had no idea he was famous- and I hope he stays that down to earth. There's alot to be said for humility! His voice is very relaxing and beautiful- its a very different sound! I love it- and I hope i get to tell him that one day~
5,Tyler is the best!,"I started listening to Tyler a while ago and haven't stopped since! He's just so good. I love finding new songs each one is amazing. He's got a great voice, great guitar skills, and wonderful lyrics. He's so talented! Buy his CD...it's amazing!!!"
4,The fourth DVD in the Tenchi In Tokyo series.,"Yugi slowly builds her forces against Tenchi and the gang. At first she tries to lure Ryo-Ohki away to the Moon, but fails. Then she tries to use a clone of Tenchi's father to bring Tenchi and Sakuya together (which would break everybody else's heart).Finally, Yugi steps into the ring directly, attacking Ryoko and blasting a lot of innocent trees. But Hotsuma, a minion of Yugi's (who we met in the first DVD) pretends to save Ryoko before she and the others are totally defeated.Where was Tenchi during all this? On a date with Sakuya!Is Yugi's plans working? Will the friendships, the bonds of love, break up and allow Yugi to remove all of Tenchi's friends from the scene? Will she trick Sasami to betray her friends or is she REALLY starting to like Sasami?"
4,Great cheap set,"Not a bad product at all. Made of tempered steel. Needed a set of open wrenches that could fit a socket (tight space with no place for a handle) and this fit the situation perfectly. Made of tempered steel (so its not ultra good quality) but compared to SEARS (where they charge 40 bucks for one crowfoot), this was a bargain. Well worth the price."
1,Glad I borrowed this from the library,"I almost bought this book from Amazon based on the excellent reviews, and a good price as usual, but I'm really glad I borrowed this from the library instead. If this book offered anything particularly insightful or tips one could really put into practice, you didn't find it in the first third of the book, after which I skimmed the rest to see it was more of the same. I decided I was done wasting my time reading anecdotes from other moms, most of which were depressing. If you want to feel empowered a much better choice is The Must-Have Mom Manual by Sara Ellington and Stephanie Triplett where they include anecdotes from their own personal, and practical, experience to relay informaton and advice to guide you through your own personal journey of motherhood."
1,Mother Trip in my recycle bin,"I read Mother Trip with anticipation and eagerness. I'd heard only good about the book and I expected only good after reading the Survival Guide with my first pregnancy. I am, however, disappointed in the Mother Trip. Maybe it's because I expected too much; maybe it's because I don't care for or buy into MARKETING TARGETED merchandise (Gen X, Slacker, etc.); maybe it's because I re-read the Survival Guide and found blatant hypocrisy (use the Catholic Church and other religious organizations when you're in need but hey, when you've gotten what you need from them diss 'em openly and freely), and that coupled with the arogant, superficial, pretentious tones and whiny attitude of the Mother Trip is enough to make me hurl. I threw Ariel Gore's books into my recycle bin where they will be the most beneficial: made into something new and useful."
5,Great Light for Running,I know it is supposed to be a bike light but the velcro strap makes it great for running. The light is much brighter than other running lights I have bought. I would highly recommend.
4,a necessity for your bike,it comes with the batteries :). it is very bright. you can mount it on the bike or use the arm strap.
4,Shines well; not so easy to lose,"I've had this one for almost a year on two different bikes (both mountain bikes). It shines bright enough, I think, so you should feel safe with it. Now, many people said the mount was not secure which caused me to double think before buying. I can say the following: yes, it does feel not secure and I can't understand why anyone would come up with such a design. However, have I ever lost it? Only once, on a plain road - not sure how that happened. I've biked on pretty rough roads and one of my bikes did not even have a suspension, but never have I lost this light.Bottom line: for the price, you can allow for the tiny bit of risk of losing this otherwise perfect light."
2,Switch difficult,"Light is OK, but it is difficult to turn it on because it doesn't have a switch. Instead you have to push hard on the bottom of the light in just the right place."
4,Bright enough light,The switch on the light is difficult to turn on because you have to push it through the plastic. The light is bright and works well
2,Fell off,"Well, I guess I should've followed everyone's suggestions but didn't. After about a week of owning it, I slid on a sheet of ice and the light fell off. If you get this light, which is super bright and probably totally awesome, be sure to tape the body to the mount. Srsly."
3,much smaller than appears on picture. button is hard to press.,i would reccomend other planet bike lights because when i bought this one i thought it was pretty large because of the picture but is actually pretty small and the button is hard to press unlike the other lights planet bike has
4,Best bang-for-your-buck of 3 I tried,"Note: I have posted this same review to the product pages of all the products listed below.I reviewed the following products, and have listed them in my order of preference:1. Cateye TL-LD610-BR 5-LED Rear Bicycle Light [...])2. Planet Bike Blinky ""7"" 7-Led Rear Bicycle Light ([...])3. Cateye TL-LD150 LED Bicycle Tail and Safety Light (Red) ([...])1. Was definitely the brightest. It was also the best-built, with the most number of blinking options. It's easy to attach and change the batteries -- all around a good design. The bicycle store clerk also said it was the brightest he had. But they're expensive.2. Is the best bang-for-your-buck. It's less designed, and not as bright, but still bright enough.3. I wouldn't recommend this one. It was significantly less bright than the other two."
5,Our Favorite Comb,"The hair on our Goldendoodle is hard on combs. On other combs we've tried we bend the teeth, the teeth fall out or break, but not with this one. Teeth are very strong and firmly anchored. We're able to make it though mats without bending teeth. Handle is comfortable too."
1,There ought to be a law,The REAL UFO is a British hard rock band that has been recording since 1972 and is still in business. How someone else is able to (mis)appropriate their name simply by putting an exclamation point after it is a matter that a good attorney should look into.
1,1 only because it wasn't a UFO album - for some wierd reason,"When I looked up UFO (the British band)this came up. Why did I have to waste my time trying to figure out what this album was, or more importantly wasn't? Answer: because some idiot picked a band name that was already taken................"
3,Just a CD player,If yo need a CD player this one is fine - not great not bad just a CD player. Bought this for my son for Christmas because he had some CDs from a few books and we had nothing to play them on. It's fine - that's all just fine.
1,could have been better,"Well I never got the book, their is a mix up in post office they said it was delivered but I never got it. Post office couldn't do anything and the seller couldn't do anything!!! So I guess that sucks for me!!! Seller did get back to me and try to resolve the issue but they couldn't do anything. I didn't pursue this issue because thankfully the book only cost 20 dollars but I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else."
2,Textbook,"textbook was very worn, not in good condition for what it was described and what i paid for. this is the first time this has happened when ordering through amazon."
3,Textbook for school,"I needed this book for school, otherwise I would not have purchased it. However, the book is well written and has some nice pictures."
3,"okay, just another textbook","This was just another textbook. I used it for my Biology for Teachers class which was one of the easiest science classes I was allowed to take for credit.It's a pretty a good textbook, just a little old and at times not in-depth enough.If it's a requirement, get this.If it's not, then get the latest version or something that goes more into detail. This is very basic of a textbook.Hope this helps,Daniel"
4,Brisk Interpretations Of Schumann's 1st and 2nd Symphonies,"These are fine interpretations of Schumann's 1st and 2nd symphonies which are replete with warm, brilliant playing by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. In both symphonies, Harnoncourt's tempi are brisk. Yet his conducting does not yield extraordinary performances. Much to my surprise, his interpretations aren't nearly as revolutionary as those for his critically acclaimed Beethoven symphony cycle with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe or his intriguing Brahms symphony cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic. Yet I do recommend this CD if you're interested in hearing Schumann's scores performed by a superb chamber orchestra. Otherwise, my primary recommendations are Kubelik's and Masur's recordings, with those by Bernstein and Thielemann also commendable. The sound quality is excellent, up to Teldec's superb standards."
3,Nice Voice,"Rain has a very nice voice and is one of the best Eastern dancers. Some of the songs in this album don't stand out a lot, but if you enjoy his singles, you will probably like all of them! the trick is to listen to it a few times, that's all. He's one of the most popular Korean singers as well as actors. He is a very successful actor, and you can't deny his profession, definitely has potential to conquer the world. But, the songs are still sort of disappointing. I'm not that much into his type of music, though the first four songs are magnificent!"
2,"This is an exceprt, not the complete book","I thought maybe I missed something in the listing, and now see that the page numbers should have caught my attention. I was looking for a complete copy of this book, and the cover image and product description don't clearly state that this is an excerpt of this novel, not the complete text."
1,Listed as Soccer doll!!!,It is listed as soccer doll yet when i opened the box on christmas eve to set out as Santa gift it was the swimmer doll. My daughter plays soccer which is why I ordered this instead of going to Walmart and buying a MUCH cheaper doll. I didn't open the box early to check it. Learned my lesson. Make sure they list it correctly if you are selling the swimmer doll list it as swimmer doll. I didn't have a chance to fix it Christmas eve night.
3,"It is what it is, a doll.","This doll is actually a christmas present but we have another that is very similar, is not made as well as the very first cabbage patch dolls, but my daughter has a lot of fun with it."
4,A workbook for life,"I couldn't get enough of this beautiful book. It's like a workbook for life, seen through the eyes of a very human, humble and inspiring man. I loved it!"
2,JVC TH-A35 Executive Home Theater System (Silver),"When I viewed this product in my local electronics store I initially thought that this would be an extremely good buy for the price..... until I got it home and was halfway through my first movie. Basically the fan kicked in which is extremely noisy (not forgetting that this system isn't the loudest in relation to volume by any means) The sporadic fan activation is a real annoyance when your viewing DVDs. Unfortunately of late it has now started skipping\freezing for a split second when playing (and I don't mean playing old DVDs, new ones fresh out of the box!!) I have returned this item 4 times already, had the laser unit replaced, the fan and various other bits and bobs that the sales guys wasn't sure about .I was cautious enough to take out a 5 year guarantee on this model do I think I may be due a few return trips yet !!! Unfortunately I'm stuck with this until JVC deem it ""Unfixable"" My advice.....Think twice before you buy this unit."
4,The First of a Great Series,"The late Tony Hillerman began one of the strongest series in crime fiction with the introduction of Joe Leaphorn in THE BLESSING WAY.It is a so-so who-done-it, which is soon solved, but along the way Mr. Hillerman introduced the reader to the Navajo culture, the great American Southwest, and the complex character of Lt. Joe Leaphorn. Leaphorm has carved a place for himself in the law enforcement community, has managed to adjust his tribal heritage to to modern society and to remain true to himself as a man.A great beginning and a great read.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
1,The Blessing Way,"The first in the Leaphorn series. Maybe because it is abridged, the Lt. Is only a minor character. The story is hard to follow. The transitions are awkward. This is another example of a story which probably should remain unabridged."
3,Good not great,"I like all the Leaphorn novels I've read (five so far) and enjoy the Navajo cultural aspects. I'm reading Code Talkers, about the last living original Navajo code talker from WWII, which is excellent, by the way, and it seems that Hillerman gets his Navajo facts that I can compare right.This first Leaphorn novel isn't as much about him, more about a white university professor friend of his, but it's still good. As usual, I knew whodunit long before the end but Hillerman is more about the ride than the mystery. If you like Leaphorn, you'll like this even without him being the total star of the show."
4,The Blessing Way,"This is the first entry in the Joe Leaphorn Novels by Tony Hillerman. I prefer to start series at the beginning, however, I started this series with the Sinister Pig. That book was very enjoyable, so I started at the beginning with this novel, The Blessing Way.First things first. This novel is not great based on the mystery plot at its center. What gives this novel its ""great"" status is the way in which it introduces the uninitiated to the Navajo Way. This book made for a very enjoyable read. Although it certainly lacked the complexity of a John Dunning novel, or the eloquence of an Elizabeth George novel, it did stand out on its very own merits. Hillerman does an excellent job of describing the dry and arid landscape. He paints an excellent picture. I was also impressed with the tension in one of the chapters in which the suspense was riveted up a couple of notches.This book was a great first in this series. I look forward to the rest."
3,"""A Nice, Quick Read""","I must say Mr. Hillerman knows his Navajo culture. Some very fascinating stuff. The plot was OK, though at times I felt it strayed a bit. It did come back in the second half of the book, which contained the most drama in the story as archeologist Bergen McKee is thrust into a life or death confrontation with the main villian."
3,"Ok book, not hillerman's best","Is a little confusing to the reader, I did not actuallty like the book until the middle of it when it got really suspenseful and interesting."
2,Did I read the wrong book?,"Hillerman must have written more than one book by the same title because The Blessing Way I read was so crammed full of Navajo culture that I forget there was an actual storyline going on. I love stories that give you a feel for the setting and of the people. A story that can draw a rich picture in the reader's mind. However, I felt that was all that was happening in this book. Overkill from my perspective. Hillerman seemed fixated on getting every aspect of Navajo culture included yet still keep it to 200 pages. I found the book very difficult to get through as a result. Hardly a page turner as other's would describe it. I guess I missed the boat on this one."
4,Worthwhile if you like Hillerman,"This is Hillerman's first novel (at least with NM tribal police). While the character of Joe Leaphorn is not drawn out much, it still is a good read. There is a considerable amount of action taking place thanks to a spunky archeologist trying to save himself and a woman in the Anasazi ruins.If you compare it with the recent Hillerman novel, The Shape Shifter, there is a dramatic difference. There Joe Leaphorn is on center stage, his wisdom and gentleness coming across, with all of the action happening at the very end."
5,Read this Hillerman rather than the recent ones,"Read this Hillerman rather than the recent ones. Warm, funny, suspenseful, and full of Navajo and local color. A true experience."
5,Another wonderful Hillerman book,"I should not review this because no matter what Tony Hillerman writes, I will love.I cannot express how much I love these Navajo Tribal Police books. I could read one a week for the rest of my life. Learning about the Big Rez, and these two fictional policemen and their families, makes me hunger to visit the Four Corners region.Mr. Hillerman explains about various ceremonies and cultural beliefs, and tribal attitudes and lifestyles, all of which ring true. I would like to read more about the cities in the Reservation, but they are destinations rather than places.Needless to say, I highly reccommend this series."
2,drill,"This is a good product for the weekend woodworker, I use the drill every day and it dosen't perform as well as I thought it would"
4,"As long as you know what this is for, it's a great buy","Pro's:-Looks Cool-I got it on the customer vote for $20-Very comfortable-Flathead/Philips combo bit attached to body so you will never lose it-Accomplishes standard drilling or screwdriver needs with ease-Chuckless bit install and removal makes it very easyCon's:-Comes only with the one screwdriver bit, yet has an oversized cheap carrying case. I threw the case away day 1 and just put the charger and drill in my bucket boss! This should have just come in a small package with no case.-You can just tell it's lacking a little in power for bigger tasks, but thats really not that bad of a tradeoff to my previous method of using a giant extension cord and very heavy drill for mostly basic needs the cordless will easily handle. Very glad I made the purchase."
4,Not bad for the money but not perfect.,"This is a nice little drill to have around the house. I use it for simple household tasks, nothing demanding, and for that is excels. It has enough power to put up a bunch of shelves (and other honeydo's) on a single charge. It feels really comfortable in your hand and doesn't feel off balanced. My one compalint is the way it recharges. You connect the battery and the AC adapter attaches to the drill handle. I would much prefer to pay a little more and get a sperate charger. As it is if you have multiple batteries you have to connect them to the drill to charge them. Defeats the purpose of a cordless drill. I'm not sure if you can get a stand alone charger, if there is I haven't found it yet."
5,Great drill for those small jobs around the house.,I got this drill in the Christmas customer votes sale. So far I have only used it around the house for light jobs. It has performed flawlessly.*It seems to hold a charge well.*The gel-grip handle does a great job of cutting out all of the vibrations.*It has an easy to adjust torque setting (to keep you from stripping out more delicate items) that works very well.This drill should serve everyone's needs for use around the house. If I would have paid full price I would still be very satisfied with my purchase.
2,misleading functions,"This product is advertised as functioning as a altimeter/barometer which is not the case. It's functions actually include wind speed, wind chill, thermometer, waterproof/submersible, clock, date, alarms, chronograph, race timer, water-flow meter. Do not be fooled like I was in thinking it was an altimeter."
5,Saved my life!,"I spent 18 months seeing 25 doctors, took pain killers, muscle relaxants, sleep meds, anti-depressant, Xanax and kept getting worse. Was unable to sleep, to sit or walk without extremem pain. Quit my job, lost my fiance, ended up hospitalized for severe depression.Then I got this book, followed it religiously. Now I'm off all medication, quit seeing all doctors, am pain free, sleeping again and have my life back!!!"
1,A disservice to FM suffers.,"This book may work for some as witnessed by other reviewers, however, I feel it perpetuates the myth that FM is only in one's head. We have enough physicians who are ""non believers"" (I've met a few) as it is. If FM patients can cure themselves with mental exercises, then I say ""have at it."" Whatever works; I fully understand that desperate people will try desperate measures. But if it works for FM, then it should work equally for cancer, heart disease, spinal injuries, Parkinson's, diabetes, et al. When, oh when, will they find out the real PHYSICAL cause for this malady? I await the day. Only then will we find a real cure."
2,too personal!,"this book provided lots of entertaining dialogue about the author's family, but failed to provide any concrete information that helped us with our child. we were really trying to purchase upside down brilliance and clearly still need to do so."
2,Better books on this topic available...,"There are other books on the market that are much more valuable than this one. Her book is also biased toward the extremely gifted VS learners (especially hers)...we got it... your kids are extremely gifted VS learners.Much more substantial books on this topic are: ""Right Brained Children in a Left Brained World"" by Jeffrey Freed and Laurie Parsons and ""Upside-Down Brilliance"" by Dr. Linda Silverman. The authors of these books are the experts in the field. This author basically copied basic ideas from these books and then wrote a lot of stories about her kids, provided stories about other VS learners and provided her personal insight into it all. The only new information from this book that you might not find in as much detail in the others are some of her own practical suggestions of how to help your child cope w/some of their areas of weakness and how to deal w/these areas as a family.If you must buy this book, BUY IT USED & SAVE YOUR $"
3,A good daily Advent reflection source,"""Behold the Star"" is a good Catholic Bible study supplement. It covers all three liturgical cycles [A/B/C], and gives reflections for each day of the Advent season (almost a month long). Each day lists the readings (first, second and Gospel) for that day along with a reflection portion for personal review.For those that wish to have a reflection based Bible study (or would like to move in that direction) for the Advent season, I think this book would help you achieve that. However each day is only partly represented (under a page for each) and you may want to add additional material if you're afraid that people may rely on the book too much.Overall though, it appears to be one of the more thorough Advent-based Catholic Bible study sources on the market, and a big plus is that this one book will last you for as long as the liturgical cycles stay fixed."
5,Great Fit,"The pants were everything specified. The right number of pockets, etc. And, they were a great fit. No wrinkles. Took them right out of the box and could start wearing them. I've worn them several times/haven't had to iron them. Would recommend them to anyone."
2,The Alagna Georghiu Tosca DVD,"This is the most awful production of Tosca I have ever encountered. The music is barely audible, the scenes are interspersed with nonsensical black and white intermissions. The important arias are slighted. UGGGHHHAAAGH!"
2,A Vulgar Performance of Angela Gheorghiu as Tosca,"A truly vulgar and repugnant performance of the Romanian diva Angela Gheorghiu. In the first act she gets no applause from the British audience, notwithstanding her beautiful voice, as she was all over her partner with repeated French long kisses as an ordinary slut. In the second act, her breasts almost fell out of her flimsy dress as she bended over. Thanks goodness that with her hand she was able to cover her moving breasts. Yuck!"
1,Beware - the formula has changed.........,If you're used to Sebastian Shaper Plus making your hair behave the way you want it to you will be disappointed in this product. For whatever reason the company decided to change the formula and it is no longer the hairspray we all knew and loved. You will do better buying something much cheaper than buying this current formulation. Why do companies always have to change things that work? If cost is the issue then for pete's sake just charge more - don't take away a tried and true product!!
3,hair spray,"The product arrived quickly and I was so happy to find this product. It seems it is off the market, however the product has changed. I have been using this hair spray for 20+ years and this spray is different. Why do they do that? Really disappointed in the product not the company who sent it."
1,Now We Know......,"After finding out that Sabastian did indeed change the formula of their Shaper Plus hairspray, I contacted the company and was given this explanation. They said that SOME states have put a limit of 'Volatile Organic Compounds' that can be used in their product....something like from 80% to 55%....so they had to decrease it in order to abide by the new guidelines. However, due to popular demand, they are putting it back on the market at the beginning of the year in the states that will allow the higher percentage. My state...Florida...happens to be one that will allow the old formula to be sold....thank goodness. I would encourage anyone who is interested, to call and find out what their state will permit. 800-935-5273Good luck!"
5,A Great holding hairspray,Have used Shaper for years and I will continue to use it for those days that I need a good hold that lasts
1,No good anymore,"I have used shaper plus hairspray since 2000 and have loved it, but they changed the formula. It doesn't work at all. Now I'm trying to find a haispray that works like the old shaper plus."
1,Found a Replacement!,"I have been buying Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray for YEARS! I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. It smoothed the frizzies, I could hot-tool-style with it, and still brush it out. Yeah, I tried it with the formula change and... hate it. It's just an ughy hairspray now. (I really hate the smell, too.) I ordered whatever I could find of the old formula, as long as I could, through Amazon. After many trials of everything from cheap to super-expensive, I think I finally found a replacement! Frederic Fekkai Sheer Hold Hairspray. Personally, I don't think it brushes out quite as nicely as the old Shaper Plus, but at least I get that smooth/no frizzy hold. The price on Amazon is comparable to Sebastian Shaper Plus. I picked up a 5.8 oz bottle locally, but I'm going to order the 11.6 oz on Amazon. If anyone else tries it and likes it, please let me know!"
1,New Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray,"I've been a user of Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray for many years and have loved the product. Recently the look of the can changed. I was assured by the salon I purchase the product from, that the change was in the look only and that the formula was the same. NOT SO! If you look at the ingredients, there are many changes to the formula. This new hairspray is garbage! I have to use half a can to get even a little bit of hold and when I go out in the wind or the humidity it loses the little bit of hold it gives altogether! So disappointing! If this was an inexpensive product it wouldn't be so upsetting but I pay close to $20.00 a can. I'm so upset to have lost the only hairspray that actually worked with my very difficult hair. The hunt is on for a replacement! Unfortunately I don't think it will be a Sebastian product."
5,hairspray user,I got my 3 cans of hairspray very quickly. I am pleased with this supplier. I will do business with them again in the future.
5,pleased with delivery and product,Very pleased with delivery and product. I've used it for years. I have fine hair and find this product to be very effective in holding hair in place without leaving the hair sticky or real stiff. Hold container at least four inches from hair when spraying.Mommasko
1,Sebastian Plus Formula Has Changed,"First of all I ordered Sebastian Plus and received Sebastian (not the Plus). They shipped the wrong product. I decided to keep it because I have used the plain Sebastian as well as Sebastian Plus. If you have used any any Sebastian formula you will be disappointed in this product. For some reason the company decided to change the formula and it is no longer the hairspray I loved. Companies should never change a formula that works. If cost is the issue then charge more - don't change the formula and take away a great product that works. I own a small business and would never change items that my customer's love and order all the time. Quality of the product you are selling, repeat business, and word of mouth is what matters when you are selling anything."
3,Sebastian Shaper Plus,The new look container is supposed to have the same ingredients but it does not work as good as the spray in the old container. Even my hair dresser noticed the difference.Jannis
1,Is there an alternative?,I used to love this product but the formula has changed and it now makes my hair stiff. I also hate the smell now. I just can't use it anymore. Has anyone found a good alternative? I bounce around from one brand to the next but have not found another one I like as much as the original Shaper.
1,Sebastian Shaper Plus Formula Change,"I purchased 3 cans from a local authorized retailer and quickly discovered that there was something wrong with them. I called the number on the can, told them they were bad and they said to exchange them at the retailer. I did that and the 3 new cans I got were exactly the same. No hold, No humidity control. I called again and this time the person I spoke to told me that the CO2 content had changed therefore the formula is different. She said they were getting lots of complaints and recommended trying Wella Dynamic Fix Hairspray.I have been using Shaper Plus for 20+ years and was very upset when this wonderful product had changed and no longer works at all."
5,LOVE IT,I have used this hairspray for years and love it. It holds without being tacky and sticky. Very easy to brush or comb thru.
2,A Total Failure,"This weak, wanna-be noir, crime novel is undone by weak characterizations and a plot that goes nowhere. The story of Eddie, an American hustler in antiques and whatever else he can turn a profit on, starts with him bumming around Amsterdam, doing hashish, checking out art, and meeting a beautiful and mysterious woman. Though her, he gets involved with a nasty Swiss-German thug and another beautiful woman. Then there's his stunning actress wife back in England... It starts to reek of author wish-fulfillment after a certain point. Veronese throws lots of art history references into the story, but that can't hide the fact that it's never at all clear why these women are drawn to Eddie. There's a lot of crap spouted by almost everyone (bikers and rock stars included) but the story all boils down to drugs and money. There's no reason to care about Eddie or any other characters, and Veronese's writing is unmemorable. If it's a homage to pulp fiction or film noir, it's an utter failure."
3,"Einstein/relativity, waitress/tip, poetry/solipsism","David used to read some of this stuff at local coffee houses, like The Hungarian Pastry Shop. After the reading, he would offer to help some of the coeds perfect their own attempts at poetry, at some undisclosed location. That is to say:When he taught English at Columbia College in the late 1970's (no tenure offer, he left), David was said by many of the students in his courses to resemble ""a movie of himself."" Excellent description, and his movie in any given decade is always good for about three stars."
1,does not work propperly,"this part is a very low quality piece. after installing this part in my car, the engine ran worse than it originally did. when it comes to parts for your VW/Audi, buy factory parts. do not settle for cheaper brands as they do not work well."
4,Wonderful travel gadget.,"I love this tool and used it regularly on a recent motorcycle tour of Colorado. The barometer showed local atmospheric conditions and helped us with daily route planning and it was fun to use to the altimeter and see just how high we were - over 12, 000 feet in Rocky Mountain National Park. The compass came in handy on our hikes.This is not a difficult tool to use and the displays are easy to read. It appears to be made of the usual Brunton quality. I didn't give it five stars because of the included instructions. Finding this hard to read document riddled with typos and confusing layout included with this sophisticated instrument struck me as bizarre.Instructions aside, this is one useful gadget."
1,"Poor documentation, not very easy to use.","They might have spent more on documenting the setup instructions of this instrument. A multi-column micro-font single sheet of paper is just plain cheap!The altimeter isn't much help because it requires constant calibration, as does an altimeter in an aircraft. The difference is that aircraft altimeters are designed to be calibrated, this one is not."
3,"It's OK, but...","Yes, there are some OK blues licks in this book and a couple of techniques for speed playing but if you are looking for really tasteful licks that make the listener really pay attention......this isn't it. It would be a great book for first year guitarists."
5,Great Product,Me and the guys we all sit around and watch this vid and drink beer. Tommy brings orderves. Our wives think were at work but in reality we all got fired for drinkin beer at work. So this vid doubles as a cover to hide from our wives. Tommys wife has a job thats why he can afford orderves. I reccommend this vid to anybody who has recently gotten fired from their job.
1,Never worked properly from the get-go!,"I ordered this product from Amazon a couple of weeks ago and returned it last week. During the first day of use, it SEEMED ok, the sound was decent, and i was fairly happy with it. But on that first day, i only accessed the first CD tray (it has a 3-CD changer...) Then during it's second day of use, when it tried to access the 2nd CD tray, it began to skip tracks, also would return to the first track on that CD... A total malfunction. I did try different CDs but all produced the same problems. And all of those CDs were commercially produced. It is Soooo annoying to spend so much time surfing and researching a product only to find it is defective from- well, ok, Day TWO!!!I was downright shocked that this piece of garbage did not work... Bottom line- i wouldn't go near this product, and me- i'm not touching any other JVC products either w/ a 10 foot pole!"
3,BETTER THAN SAND...,"I'm the guy that gives 5 star reviews on almost everything. I'm easy to please, but I'm having big regrets about this purchase. I've been using Astroglide for years, and after trying this stuff, I think I'll stick to Astroglide. This is my first jump into silicon lubes and I have to say, I wasn't impressed. Way more friction than I'm used to, way more need to re-lube more often than I'm used to, it feels super greasy and it doesn't wash off with just water and for what you're getting, it's expensive.The bottom line, is that it works, but knowing what I know now, this should be a $4.99 for 8oz kind of deal. I'll be keeping this stuff for a rainy day I guess, but I already bought a new bottle of the other stuff."
5,#1 lube for us,This lube is by far the best silicone lube out there..its not slimy or sticky and the aloe vera and vitamin e soak into your skin leaving it soft! other lubes make my skin slimy and never seem to get it off my skin. be careful with the bottle if you get it on the bottle it does get slippery!
5,Best Lube Ever,My boyfriend ordered this for us. He said it would take two days to come... it took two minutes. :)
3,Great lube...crappy packaging 5 Stars for the lube--1 star for bottle.,"I have been a fan of silicone lubricant for a while and always bought SwissNavy. Decided to give this a try and I like the acutal lube a lot, but the bottle is another story. As soon as I opened the package the pump top wasn't attached. I put it back on and it immediately fell off and wouldn't stay on. I poured the lube into an old SwissNavy bottle so crisis averted. 5 stars for the actaul lube--1 star for the bottle. Overall 3 stars I would say."
4,"Great product, bottle not as shown",This is great lube - my current favorite and worth the money. But the bottle I received was the same amount of product with a pump top instead of the top shown.
5,The best,Great product. This stuff is so smooth and not sticky. A little goes a long way. We swear by this lube.
4,Gun oil is the greatest personal lube ever!,"I've used gun oil for myself and partner for years. It's a fantastic personal lubricant. The only reason I took away a star was due to the new packaging. The new style bottle and pump are not as convenient as the old style pump bottle. The old style pump could be placed on a table top and used without having to pick up the bottle. This new pump must be picked up to be used or else the oil will just drip back on to the bottle. It's just a matter of convenience. Otherwise, the gun oil itself is just as fantastic to use as ever. It does not dry out like water based lubes and is condom safe."
4,YES.,"It serves it's purpose quite well.Love it, although I need to hop into the shower when I'm done. For quick stuff, I stay with water-based, since they're an easy cleanup."
5,Review on the Essense of Life,"We tried it. Told friends about the dimethicone as a sensual contact enhancer. Ordered 3 eight ounce bottles - us and two ""gifts"" for friends - so it's a different kind of gift. Everyone is very happy... can't get that grin off their faces... will write more later if able to move... on second thought, if able to move, would rather use more Gun Oil for its obvious purpose."
2,Too Dry,I ordered a 2oz. bottle of gun oil and i found that it is outperformed by ordinary ky jelly. This stuff IS less messy but the primary requirement is lube and this is inferior to water based products in my opinion!
5,Great product--great price,"A very good quality silicone lube, certainly almost as good as any other even if the others cost several times as much."
4,Yay: slippy! Ugh: messy!,"Excellent lube esp. for back-door action, stays oily and doesn't dry out, but it's very hard to clean up. Takes multiple rounds with dish soap on the toys and bar soap on us and still feels oily... and forget it if you get any on fabric; it's there for good."
4,Get your Gun Out,"Nice stuff! Really is! Slippery, Oily. I have had better luck and preference with water based, but this stuff is good."
5,If you only buy one book . . .,"If you only buy one book, buy 'Decks 1-2-3' from the Home Depot series. This book tells you darn near everything you will need to know to build a deck. Their attempts to sell you every tool imaginable are pretty transparent -- there are several pages devoted to listing the ""essential"" tools, all of which are conveniently available for purchase at your nearest Home Depot. However, the technical descriptions of the construction tasks are clearly illustrated and explained, and that's really what matters.I recently built a wooden deck in my backyard. For other suggestions and review, check out my 'So you'd like to...' guide."
1,Product requires multiple daily applications. Delivery design is horrible,To get this product to work you need to saturate each weed daily for a week or two. That is the only way I get it to work. The delivery system has extreme design flaws if you want to carry the gallon jug and spray and walk. The white connector pulls shut and stops the spray if you carry it and spray trying to use the length of tubing provided. The tubing hose is too short. This makes the product very frustrating to use. I also don't trust Scotts Corp at all with pet safety and their products after they fully acknowledged putting substances that killed birds in their birdseed. Beware.
2,"Good Sprayer, but doesn't kill weeds...","I was a bit disappointed with this products. As the title says, the sprayer works very well. Pull out the handle, and then all you have to do is point the nozzle and pull the trigger. It was actually mildly enjoyable to ""shoot"" the weeds. So I gave it an extra star for this...That said, it did nothing to kill my weeds. I've used Weed B Gon for two years in a row following the directions explicitly, but all my dandelions are still here. They wilted for a couple days after applications, but were soon back to full strength. I made two applications as suggested... still no luck. My neighbor pays a lawn service to come care for his lawn twice a year and his lawn looks amazing. While I have not checked pricing, I would bet two visits per year from a professional lawn service would be similar in cost to multiple applications of this stuff."
3,Foxtail,"It seems to kill most of the weeds however it doesn't seem to want to kill foxtail, even though its on the label."
1,weeds weeds evey where!!!,Has this happen to you? I used Ortho Weed-B-Gon MAX this year on my lawn and now there is more crabgrass and other weed then ever before!!! I am really not happy about this.
1,Get Round Up Instead,This stuff took forever to kill the weeds. Should've just purchased Round Up which always works quickly and effectively. This stuff sucks.
1,Weed Killer,"Unfortunately, this weed killer is no better than others I've tried. After applying it, after several days, not one weed has been killed. In fact, some of them look healthier than they were previously."
1,Weed Fertilizer,I have used this product 2 times on dollar weed and spurge. It did not work either time. The old weed b gone worked great this product doesn't work at all in Texas. I used it at the required dilution and temp.
3,Nice photos,"I bought some books on tree houses cause I want to build one. This was no help. Nice pictures (and ideas, maybe), tough.If you want to look pictures and dream, buy the book. Otherwise don't."
3,"Heavy-handed, same old, same old","Val Davis has an ability to write. Where she falls short is her creativity. In Davis' book she just simply kills EVERYONE off. The government just kills this one and this one and that one and that one. And I sit there thinking, oh, please, not ANOTHER one!! Every time I read one of her books, I read and read and become engaged. Then she starts killing people off left and right, and I chuck the book because it is so unrealistic and heavy-handed. I could not even get part way through Spanish Lady."
4,2.35 x 26 60a not 70a,"I ordered the 2.35x26 70a tire for use on the front of my bike. What arrived was the 60a version. I wanted this tire for higher air volume to reduce pinch flats, and wider for better cornering and more cushion. this tire has provided all of these. I have put about 50 single track miles on it so far and there is no visible wear even after going across multiple sharp edged rocks. I would recommend this tire for loose over hard pack, and rocky areas. while it does not have a high roll resistance, it is not a great tire if you use your bike on streets. The soft compound tends to degrade quickly on pavement."
5,Awesome Tire,"I could tell a difference with this tire over my old ones within the first min. I bought and installed this tire on the front and rear at the same time, there is a noticable differnce in the corners. I hit a couple of the corners I am use to and I was able to lay the bike into the curve alot more than usual."
4,Great comb...but a little hard.,"This comb really gets out knots. I have a goldendoodle that has wavy hair and it really works great on her. The only complaint that I have is that since it is metal, it is a little sharp and hard."
2,Overcomplicates Things,"This book makes the OGET a lot more complicated than it really is. I did not use the OSAT portion of the book since I do no plan on teaching Elementary school. Much of the book is just a list of grammar rules you should have learned well before it comes time to take this test. Also, it neglects to mention that you do not need to memorize all of the math formulas the book reviews. All of the formulas are given to you during the test. As long as you know how to use them, you'll do fine. Most of the test focuses on basic reading comprehension, so you should definitely try to brush up on those skills. Feel free to check out this book (or the updated version) from your local library, but I would not bother paying money for it."
3,OGET is ok,This book is helpful in that it has a full length practice test. The grammar and reading comprehension part is the most useful. It tells you to memorize or know lists of authors that is unnecessary and the math problems were not quiet up to speed. I recommend this book but in conjunction with the test study guide that the OK dept of education offers with this test. Had I not looked at that I would have missed some math questions. This book does not cover all the right kinds of math problems. It was useful but I recommend using the study guide online as well. You can print it off yourself or order it for a minimal fee.
5,Capitals T-Shirt,Great T-shirt for any Capitals fan. I paired this with a pair of Capitals Lounge pants to make a present for a teenager.
1,headlight issue,"the head lights i order was supost to come with xenon bulbs hi-low beam ! i called to complain , and this is what i got , unreal !"
1,Incorrect product spec,"From the description, it said the low beam bulb and fits my Acura MDX 2005. However, it turns out this type of bulb only fits for high beam light on Acura MDX 2005. I am really disappointed by this misleading information."
4,Different setting than usual...,"I liked this book, it was good, clean, easy to read. I liked that the setting was different from the usual balls and social gatherings that you often find in historical romance novels. The main characters had enough time to get to know each other before they fell in love, which I really like and they were both intellegent."
5,Information,This book is very well written. I have actually been able to write several sermons from the daily messages.
4,Digging a Little Deeper,"Since my son is studying Greek at seminary I thought it would be nice to learn a little about the language of the New Testament, too. This daily devotional book takes a selected scripture and gives a deeper understanding of the verses based on the Greek meanings of various words and phrases. Then, the selected scriptures are used in an application to our daily lives."
5,Wonderful devotional book,"I bought this book for a friend at the recommendation of another friend. I liked it so much, I put it on my Kindle. I put it on text to speech and listen to it while I work on my quilting projects or some other project. It gives the background in the original Greek and what is happening in the time period of the text. It gives amazing insights into the scriptures. I highly recommend it to anyone."
5,Fantastic Study,I love this book. It is so informative and easy to use. I have purchased four others as gifts and the recipients are enjoying it also.
2,365 Days of Power by Rick Penner,"I love this book in the hardcover and have given various copies away. But my Kindle edition isn't user friendly, omits so much and is disappointing. I hope it gets fixed.365 Days of Power"
4,Sparking Gems From the Greek,"Amazing daily insights from the actual scriptures in a devotional format. If you have any knowledge of the Bible, these words provide additional insights! The purchase and delivery were very easy & fast. Like 2 Days fast!"
5,A True Meeting With God,This is the best in depth devotion I have ever had. I have learned and grasped more than ever. When you daily complete this devotion you absolutely feel like you have spent time or meet with God.
5,A Gem necessary in life.,"Rick Renner does a fabulous job of guiding you on a spritual journey. Each day you are exercising your heart, mind and spirit as you build a closer relationship to God. Great for ages 17 and older. Great as a family discussion daily devotional!"
4,Sparkling Gems by Rick Renner,"Well written, very informative. I always appreciate a writer sharing information that may have taken a lifetime to collect, sharing so we can benefit in the short time it takes to read the book."
3,so-so,"Book was ""luke-warm"" in terms of academic substance and also spiritual inspiration. Was some surprised that Joyce Meyer touted it so highly."
1,Skip this book,"Renner's books have claimed that ""Rick Renner is a highly respected Bible teacher who effectively combines his expertise in biblical Greek with the power and anointing of the Holy Spirit."" Having found many glaring errors and misstatements about ""the Greek"" in his ""Sparkling Gems"" (available for free via daily devotional e-mail from his Web site), my advice is: Skip this book.To the reviewer who criticizes me and my review: He speaks/writes without knowledge. I've even discussed Renner's Greek knowledge with Renner himself. Subscribe to Renner's ''Sparkling Gems'' at his Website, and take a couple weeks' worth to a seminary NT Greek teacher and ask him or her what he/she thinks of Renner's Greek knowledge. Then you'll know whether or not to buy this book."
1,Sparkling Gems,I don't understand what you want here. I am enjoying this book because words I read in the Bible come from Greek language and it explains the meaning of them better.
2,An unfortunate purchase,"I don't know where to begin, but let me say that this resource by Renner seems to be too much talk about the interpersonal woes of his staff and ministry team life. I purchased Sparkling Gems with high hopes of it resembling Rick's ""refuel with rick"" morning video devotion. But to say the least it has been uneventful reading. I expected that he might give a more useful and pragmatic analysis of the Greek literature, but at several points, it seems to me that Renner only uses it as support for making ""his"" point. It is certainly not a serious resource to utilize for any significant Greek word study. I was disappointed to say the least. I would love to send it back, in fact I just might."
1,"Sorry, not a sparkling gem -- over-rated","(This is my first and probably last review, but I feel strongly about this.) I virtually never buy books new -- but I bought this book based on the 90+ people saying it was fantastic... I expected to be blown away, but have been very disappointed. In addition, the text could be written much 'tighter', there is much superfluous copy, ie, seems to be padded to thicken the book.And to add to other negative reviews saying the Greek is not good, I now notice that the endorsers are not exactly known for their intellectual/theological rigor. I can't help but think that these very influential speakers have influenced some of their closer followers to pump this book.I really wish I had known about the free daily email version -- I'd love my $25 back too! Rick seems to be a great Christian, working in Russia 'n all, but this book doesn't come close to delivering for me. Sorry about that chief."
1,Sparkling Gems,This is not the product I expected. I thought this was an audio version of the book I already have. The book is great. I wanted the audio version so I could heard the greek vwords and listen while driving.The worse part is that I can not return it because it arrived opened. I AM HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.
5,Inspired writing,I received my copy of Sparkling Gems with a purchase I made from Joyce Meyer Ministries and I am so glad that I did. Reading the daily devotionals has been a huge blessing to me. By putting the Greek definitions into terms that I can understand it has helped bring much more meaning to my Bible reading. I love it so much I bought three more copies as Christmas gifts this year.
5,Sparkling Gems from the Greek,If you are ever to get beyond 'baby' knowledge of the Bible and step into the real MEAT of the Word then you need to buy Sparkling Gems from the Greek by Rick Renner. You will not be sorry.
4,Exclusive and sexy,"Call me biased but I must say this book is very colorful and exclusive like UPMC which celebrates Hispanic heritage month, has lots of South American foreign graduates and a Jewish student center. It is so sexy and glamorous."
2,do not suggest this product,From day one had problems with it eating tapes and after 6 months vcr part has gone out completely. By the time you pay shipping and the fixed cost for exchange you can buy a new one. I myself will think twice before buying another philips product.
2,"good dvd, bad vcr","The dvd is just fine, tends to purchase a combo, end up only the dvd works and need a vcr to play my old tapes. Too lazy to return."
1,overpriced and underperformed,"We paid more than $200 for this piece of junk a couple years back. The remote is really difficult to use, and there are no buttons on the VCR to operate it (beyond PLAY and STOP) without the remote. Worst of all, the VCR died within 2 months and 3 uses. Now it just sits there on the entertainment center, taking up room and reminding us of our wasted dollars."
3,So-So,"I've had mine for 3 or 4 years with not one single mechanical problem even though both the DVD and VCR get A LOT of regular (daily) use. My trouble is that I've lost my manual, recently set up a cable box and can't figure out how to coordinate the machine with the cable box!! And I usually NEVER have trouble programming these things. It's making me feel a little moronic and I'm considering buying a new machine solely for a sense of vindication."
1,worked for one year,"We were happy with this dvd/vcr player. We'd bought it because it was inexpensive and we wanted fewer components in our media cabinet. It was fine for a year. Now, suddenly the DVD doesn't work at all. I guess these combo units are never a good idea.Now I have to rush out and buy yet another dvd player before my kids drive me mad on these rainy days."
3,"Merry Christmas,not","My grandmother bought this for Christmas. The picture is good on the vcr but the dvd part is not compatable on the t.v. since it has a built in vcr,even thought I dont use that one because it eats tapes. Otherwise you can make video copies of dvds, or at least thats what Philips told me when I called. The dvd player has black lines going through it. Thanks for reading."
2,"Nice combo, but only got 7 months use","This is a nice combination of VCR and DVD and a great space saver. Unfortunately, 7 months after purchase, the DVD stopped opening and closing. Philips has a 91-day to 1-year warranty and will prorate the product for replacement. You send them the machine and a check and they send you a new one. Not good pricing on exchange, either."
3,"Worked for a year, then DVD player dies","I gave this unit 3 stars based on the ease of use and how much I've liked the interface over the last year. Unfortunately, after the 1 year mark the DVD player is dying and constantly freezes up making it necessary to eject the DVD and then re-start the movie. The VCR is still working great.I'm in the market for a new DVD, and have been happy with Philips so far. I think this time we won't get another combo unit, though."
2,No problems until now - 1 year later!,"We bought this when we moved to our new home last March. Starting in February of this year, the VCR part started eating tapes after it rewound them. And just this week the DVD started skipping on several different ones.Up until now, we haven't had a problem. I even liked the remote! But I'm very disappointed that my warranty is now up, and the product only lasted a year! I will not be buying Phillips again...especially after reading the other reviews!"
5,Good price and good product,"I have had this item for 2 months now and have watched numerous DVD's on my 55"" hdtv. Works like a charm and has great picture quality. I have not attempted to do any type of recording, or even use the VHS yet.There is a switch on the back where you can choose progressive scan or normal. I only used the progressive scan feature.The main reason why I purchased this is because my HDTV is also a phillips (55PP9753). What I really need to get now is the home theather system.Very happy with it."
5,need to read the manual for remote,"remote controll operation is relatively sophisticated, and i could not have used it without reading the manual, but after that it is a delight. for a reasonalbe price, it provided excellent features, such as ability to play VCD, JPEG, ability to record from DVD to VHS within the player, and does all these things really well, as long as you are familiar with instruction manual, which is easy to use as well."
2,review after one year,"First DVD unit and with space limited, went for the combo. Remote is not user friendly, hard to use. VCR and DVD worked fine. Programming the VCR once set, can not be turned off, even after recording is complete. Finally had to eject tape to restore basic operation. Now the bad news, after abut one year, VCR ate my tape. Rescued the tape, but VCR will no longer accept tapes. Either ejects them or will not load them. After reading countless reviews, not sure what to get as replacement."
5,The anthology that has it all,"From the mid 1970's through the mid 1980's, Styx cranked out one master piece after another. This anthology has captured all of this music together. The antholgy cover every period from the earliest days to the most recent releases. The beauty is that all of the truly great works that band recorded actually made it on to the disks. The heavy emphasis is one the golden period of the classic line up of the band with Tommy Shaw and Dennis Deyoung. It is nice to see some of the early work that is not so well known except for ""lady"". It is also nice to see some of the most recent work included to allow a long time fan to see what the band has done recently. In my opinion, the newer material is not the same quality of the old, but it doesn't mean it is bad either. If you are a STYX fan, this is the perfect collection from the band. Highly recommended."
5,32 for you,"well,styx has put together another cd, planned a tour,and once again, proving that these are ""the best of times"" indeed!! emerging from the wilderness into the high life again. styx as before, styx as always. can't keep a good band down."
2,Missing!,"I'm a big Sytx fan and have most of their studio albums so this collection isn't of interest to me. But the omissions of Don't Let it End, Why Me and Love at First Sight prompted me to give this a poor rating. I guess Anthology doesn't technically mean best of or greatest hits, but I hate when collections are put together and charting singles are left out. I would recommend getting Greatest Hits and Greatest Hits Part 2 if you're just looking for a Styx collection."
1,"No ""Don't Let It End"" = FAIL","There is no excuse to omit ""Don't Let It End,"" a top-10 hit from 1983, one of their best and most popular songs."
1,why the did what they did,why why why is what is on my mind this cd could have and would have been way better with my favorite artest dennis deyoung. it hurts my heart to see that styx did the thing they did to dennis they have not been good for years now no dennis well no styx except a fake and a raw band so i guess all you styx fans just dont understand anything dennis deyoung was styx and will always be styx in my heart and anyone else in the band now just aint styx so i hope one of these days styx wanna bez will join the real styx of dennis deyonug and this cd does suck
1,Philosophical Breakthrough,"This CD finally proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that there is no God. No benevolent ruler would sit idly by while music this bad was being unleashed on innocent people. A plague of locusts would be much easier to take than this CD.Styx featured the kind of song writing that only developmentally delayed junior high kids would pen. Then, they performed their songs over a barrage of generic guitars and cheesy synthesizers. The result is the most synthetic, formulated music ever to come out of the corporate music industry."
1,How many times can you release the same music?,"I've been a Styx fan since the mid 70's... I'ts gett'n old guys! How many times can you release the same material, in a different order, with maybe a new tune, and sell it as an album. I'm done with the rehashed re-releases of old music... Do yourself a favor.... If you really want to experience Styx, buy thier top 3 Albums (in my opinion as a long time fan) 1. Grand Illusion, 2. Paradise Theatre, 3. Pieces of Eight... If you like these then venture to the rest of thier work... buy the remasters of the original albums... these compilations are just a money sync off the fan base... hopefully most of us are older and wiser... On a side note... If you get the chance catch the original Lead singer of the band, Dennis DeYoung, on his solo tour... he does Styx music and his solo stuff with an Orchestra... Its a real treat..."
5,A couple of great disks,"My only complaint is that I don't have a CD changer in my car and have to manually swap the disks from this set whenever I want to change. Other than that, the songs sound incredible with the new remastering, and you can see that even after 30 years and several line-up changes (beginning with original guitar player John Curelewski), the Styx sound never changed, and continues to get better, as the new track ""One With Everything"", from their newest album, proves.I would have liked to have seen two more songs from their early, early days - Young Man and Witch Wolf. No matter, though - it's still a great collection."
2,"Not ANOTHER ""Best Of""","Enough with the incomplete ""Best of"" CD's!! We want to see all of the pre-1990 CD's remastered."
2,Wayyyyy too much!,"Styx was named after the river that leads to Hades, the mythological Greek underworld. This may give you a clue as to how I feel about their music.Styx fancied themselves prog rockers. In the 70s, they released a handful of massively popular synthesizer-heavy singles that might have been tolerable on the radio, but no one needs two CDs worth of the many other pompous, sophomoric songs they produced in the 80s (Mr. Roboto, anyone?) which they continue to flog on endless tours with varying personnel.The lead vocals are dreadfully whiny and of uncertain pitch. This melodramatic caterwauling quickly grates on the nerves if one is masochistic enough to continue listening. Some may want to buy the CD ""The Grand Illusion"" (not a bad album) to help them relive their misspent youth, but they really should save their money for much more worthwhile music.Domo arigato, but no thanks!"
4,Best Greatest Hits Yet for Styx,"I definitely disagree with some of the other reviewers here. This compilation is cheaper than buying GH's 1 & 2 and includes all the good songs there. Yes, there is some fluff here, but every compilation that trys to cover a whole groups career always has fluff in the end as the band goes downhill.Stxy peaked at Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight, so most fans will already have those CD's. This completes their stuff.Two song items to note. This has the original ""Lady"" which wasn't on the GH's (who wants a 1995 version of a classic?) and it also has the original non-album extended version of Man In the Wilderness from Grand Illusion. It's about one minute longer with extra guitar work!"
3,"Good, but not the best","Styx Anthology is a fair representation of the evolution and style of the band Styx. However, despite the addition of some more obscure and in my opinion treasured tracks, the album does leave out some of the best. The biggest disappointment for me was the absence of the '99 album Brave New World, which I believe to be some of their best work. Plus, I feel that some of the more ""unusual but classic"" Styx work has been neglected, such as Grand Illusion's Castle Walls, or Kilroy was Here's Heavy Metal Poisoning or Double Life. The music is pure, and all of the tracks are excellent songs, but I feel that for an anthology they needed songs from every album and every style to give a TRUE representation. This album is good, but not the best."
1,Broke after two years of use,We owned this for two years and it worked okay until one day the CD changer refused to open with five brand new (!) discs inside. The JVC authorized repair shop wanted $158 to fix the laser which was damaged when the unit jammed. They took $36 just to get the CDs out.Other problems:- The clock mysteriously kept losing time (how does that even happen with digital electronics?)- The reciever is too deep to fit on a small shelf like a bookcase.- It does NOT play mp3s of any sort.In short buy something else.
5,Great Product,"Easy to use. Easy to set up. Sound Quality great on both tape and CD, but especially important is that you can almost completely eliminate thumping bass and adjust the treble to suit individual tastes."
2,Bruising on back,"My husband has been using this item for a week now. At five minutes per day it is leaving terrible bruising on either side of his spine. He is not sure if he feels any improvement. There looks like there is another product called lumbar extender. It may eliminate the bruising problem because the side supports are wider. Wish he would let me include a picture!!! Use with caution, and ONLY if a normal weight."
1,waste of money,This is hard piece of plastic and very akward to use. In my opinion is a waste of money.Spine-Worx Back Realignment Device
5,Low back and T-Spine stretch,"I'm an old paratrooper and have spine issues from top to bottom. A few minutes on this device seem to help me remain pain free and out of the chiropractors' office. I did have a little BPV after using it and NOT laying on my side as described in the instructions. Even with a pillow under your head while on this, you head hangs back pretty far. This can allow the fluid in your ears to reposition which apparently caused the vertigo. Just lay on your side in the fetal position for a few minutes as described and you are gtg."
3,was not for me,"this product is well built & very affordable but i found it to be a bit too uncomfortable for me, i also purchaed this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G6ZRF0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6 (North American Healthcare JB4866 Arched Back Stretcher) and like it alot better. this one really dug up into my back & didnt feel right."
4,May work for some - Follow directions carefully,"May work for some, but didn't do much for me.Does seem to help me if performing normal stretches after using for 5-10 minutes.I could see how some might find more benefit depending on issues...But very important to read directions to avoid injury or increased problems.Discuss with doctor or chiropractor prior to use."
2,Did not work for me,"The product is well made however I think the spine tracks should be spaced farther apart. I used it for 5 minutes once and the next day I had brusies on my back. I'm trying the davinci tool next I'm looking for something that will ""crack"" my back."
5,Good device,"I go to chiro 2x/mo , have had back issues over 30 years, and this device is definitely a helper.Simple, helps make the back feel like it's ""stretching and loosening""Not a whole lot to say - it's comfortable, easy to use, easy to keep away from the kids, and it does what I need.Price is reasonable for the results."
1,I was sore for a week.,This thing is so hard that it bruises you from top to bottom. I gave it a few days after the first trial but I later felt like someone beat me on my back with a baseball bat. I can't believe all the good reviews.
1,not worth it,"I read the reviews which I found mixed and thought I would be on the side that benefitted from the device. I am medium frame and height and basically suffer from an spine that does stay aligned. But like others, I am going back to the doctor because the device made my condition worse. It is a great concept but the place for your spine to line up is very narrow and if you don't get it right...well. Anything is a worth a try when you have back pain."
2,not for me,"This product might work for re-aligning your spine but that was not my issue, I have had lower back pain for a long time. I tried it for only about a week but I did not notice any improvement. I might try the trueback because i know its specifically for lower back pain but amazon did not have at the time."
1,Yikes! Contoured to fit whose spine?,Sorely wish I had had the opportunity to read Dimasin's review before I placed my order! I cannot recommend this torture rack to anyone of average or greater height! No instructions or written guidelines were included in the package.
3,Spine Worx Works!,We bought this with some doubt that it would be effective but it does what it says it will. Although learning to endure the initial pain was an adjustment. You are supposed to lay on it for 5 minutes and sometimes that is more than you can bear but your back does feel better when you have used this contraption.
5,SkyMall Wonder,"Saw this in sky mall for years, finally decided to get one. I have been using it about 3 times a week and it has drastically helped with lower back pain."
2,"Close, But No Cigar","They are so close to making this something that could work for people. The idea is ingenious: Mold a piece of plastic into the shape of a persons back to make it realign itself.I'm sure whoever helped model their back for the prototype really enjoys it, but one size isn't going to fit all. If they made it adjustable it would be a million times more pleasing. Also, I'm not always sure if my backbones are centered correctly, which could actually lead to worse back problems.Bottom-line: Save your money and buy the $90 (which was only $75 a couple years ago) back stretcher. It has a wider middle and is adjustable."
2,Not for everyone,I really didn't like the way this device felt. It was too hard and I felt like I'd fall off of it. I tried it for three weeks and didn't like it. I returned it. Good return policy - thank you.
3,"What was the point of that? It hurts a bit, but so still does my back","I'm less than thrilled with the back product. I can't say that it has done any actual harm, but in my particular situation, with my condition of degenerated discs at L5-S1 & S1-S2, I have certainly experienced no relief after several weeks of use. My customer service experience, however, was fantastic. For what that is worth."
3,still not quite sure,"Been using it now almost 2 months, and even tho it gives immediate relief, I'm still waking up some mornings w/ lower back pain, which is why I bought this in the 1st place. So, the jury is still out whether I love it or not..........will update later."
1,Ouch,"Getting your spine on it correctly is very difficult, and after trying it for a week I was in more pain than ever. Be careful."
2,Doesn't work,"I REALLY wanted this to work, but sadly, it has probably hurt more than helped. I followed the tips of others and used a towel to cushion the device. I tried it the first time on my bed, as the floor is just too hard. It seemed OK. The second day I tried the floor and was in terrible pain immediately. Since then I have used the bed and gave the device a week to see any help. I think I am worse than before. Use very cautiously! You can probably hurt yourself badly on this."
2,Didn't fit my back right...not a one-size-fits all device,"This sounds like a good idea, but unfortunately I'm too tall for it. The curvature in the lower back area was good, but it didn't allow ample room for my neck. Will be returning it soon."
1,Worst product ever!,"What a piece of garbage! I had some good experience with most of ""Health"" related products, but this is not one of them. Definitely not worth your money! Even gradual use doesn't warrant absence of pain after each application. It's just another gimmick to get you back to chiropractor's office. After using this device you will require a prolong treatment for sure. Also, it's quite short for anybody 6' and above. Yes, it does cause more pain than before use!Please, note this comment left by the younger individual with no organic problems in the spine (and not ""overweight"" as well). Should you have any neurologic complications to your lower back, don't even try to lie down on this ""thing"". You will probably need some medical treatment after.I hope this will help you to decide!"
2,Poorly made and very cheap plastic,"I purchased this for my wife to see if it would help her back pain from child birth. I was very shocked to see that it was made of cheap molded plastic except for the foam cushioning on the top. It felt like it would break with just a small amount of pressure. Perhaps if this is used for very small, very lightweight people it might be effective. If you are tall or above an average weight, don't bother buying it."
2,Not For Me,"I tried this thing out for a week and decided it just wasn't for me. I know when you're in pain you're willing to try anything, but I'd suggest trying something else. It may work for some but it definitely won't work for all."
1,I don't know about this???,"I tried it and did not like it at all, didn't relieve any pressure and its not very relaxing trying to get your body on it. Its a very strange device. I sent mine back!!"
5,Love it!,"I love this product. I have a rib that gets out of place from time to time and I spend $50.00 to go to the doc and get it popped back in. This product takes care of that for me, when I need it at no additional charge! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!"
3,So far it did not hurt me - but it did not help either,"3 weeks into owning spine-worx I can say that I am not feeling much change. It feels mostly comfortable lying on the device - I do feel it is relaxing my muscles, but beyond that - nothing else.So, yes - it does seem to help relaxation part, but so does $5 pillow :)"
4,Mostly outstanding,It takes some practice laying down on it and a little more practice getting off. The stretch it provides is better and better as you learn to relax and learn to reposition your hands on your chest or abdomen to provide that tiny bit more weight up and down your back.Fantastic!
3,Works Okay,"You're not going to get the feel or sound of an actual Chiropractic adjustment, but it does help if you give it time."
3,OK,this is an ok product. I don't think it works that well. My girlfriend thinks it works ok. I guess it is just hit and miss with some people and different back problems
2,Didn't do anything.,"I tried everything I could think of to make this work for me, to no avail. I'm sending it back. It wasn't painful or uncomfortable the way some other reviewers describe (although I've never had any kind of surgery or anything, so maybe that's a factor), it just didn't do *anything.* So frustrating. There's something really appealing about the idea of straightening out your back and putting it back into alignment. But after using this device (one time for as long as 45 minutes) I've concluded that it doesn't work for everyone.I gave it two stars instead of one only because it seems to be solid and reasonably well-made. It's no beauty, but it won't fall apart."
4,super fast shipping,i like this as of the first time. it actually felt like i was having my back adjusted. i will see what happens over time.
2,back health,A little painful to use and doesn't seem to fit all heights. Can't say that I would buy it again. It is rather pricey for a piece of rigid plastic
1,I dont get it,"Claims to be a ""one size fits all"" But for a spine? Really? That's pretty much impossible. I tried it just like the instructions said and did'nt get it. Don't waste your money."
1,one size does NOT fit all,"this thing is a waste of money. One size does not fit all (how could it?). For me at 5'5"", this thing was too long to fit my spine properly. Save your money and get an inversion table. Or try a vertical knee raise machine at the gym, that adjusted my back better than anything (look it up on google to see what the machine looks like)"
1,Product warning,The instructions say this product is not to be used if you have medium to severe scoliosis. This warning should be published in the product information on the website. I have moderate scoliosis so I had to return it.
1,A waste of money,"Dont waste your money, this thing did nothing for me, i bought a blue runble roller with the ble knobs and got real relief"
1,Not Good.,I don't think it does anything. It might even be harmful. I went to the Chiropractor and he said I had a hole in my spine the vertabra was so push in. Don't waste your money and ask your Dr. what he thinks. I could be bad.
1,Pain in the back,"More of a pain in the back than what was expected, sits in the corner and collects dust."
2,Don't Bother,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he says it is very uncomfortable and doesn't work for his problem.
2,Doesn't work...,"Doesn't fit the shape of my back or my husbands... I am only 5'5"" and he is 6'4"". It is also very hard to know if your spine is in between the guides."
1,Dumb,"I figured, what the heck, this is cheap enough. Why Not?. .. Don't even waste the money. To be honest, the space given to squeeze your spine into is way to narrow. I'm 6'2"", this thing doesn't fit my back at all. It's not that it hurt really bad, or caused bruising. I gave it a fighting chance and it honestly was a disappointment. It's sitting in a closet now, I've had much better luck with helping my back through an inversion table, and mostly through weightloss and yoga. This contraption seems to be created for a very specific demographic. I don't think I was one of them. Not sure how a ""one-size fits-all"" mentally could possibly work on something like this, where clearly nobody has the same exact body type or composition. Don't buy. Try inversion with exercise and a little yoga/stretching thrown in."
1,Disappointing Results,"I ordered this product with great hopes of great results. However, after using the product only twice, I had horrible resulting pain which took several weeks and a couple of chiropractic appointments to recover. Just be careful you don't do more damage than good if you order this, Perhaps it's great for those with less severe back conditions, but I can't recommended it."
1,waste of money,"I was hoping for some sort of relief from this contraption. Possible even be able to stretch out the the chest muscles. Waste of money for me. It is painful or at very least extremely uncomfortable. The yellow part that the spine rests in, is very stiff. I've tried using this several times, read and re-read the directions, and it still suc*s !!!"
1,"Go see a chiropractor, instead...","This device feels cheap and really has not done much to relieve my back pain. For back pain relief the only thing that has worked for me is regular visits to my chiropractor. I'm glad that this device may have worked for some people, but it didn't do anything for me. Honestly, I would rather have a well-trained professional properly diagnose and treat my back pain than leaving it up to chance with this device. Stay away from this one..."
5,weird at first but take it slow and it feels amazing !!,"I broke my back 4 months ago in a lot of pain every day wanted to try this and so far it feels great, go slow laying on it and once you relax u can feel where your back should be its very relaxing , I love it !"
3,Not to sure!,I am not super excited about this product! It's made of really firm material makes it uncomfortable to use for more than a minute or so.
2,Uncomfortable,"This device is not comfortablet at all. Especially when you are first laying on it and your weight is not evenly distributed. I thought I might be able to replace my chiropractor, but was dissapointed with this device. It is now collecting dust."
2,Spine-Worx,"This thing is really uncomfortable. I have tried it on the floor, on the bed and on the couch. On the floor it just hurts, on the other two it is not stable enough to do any real good."
2,It did not work!,"It was a good idea, but it did not help or create pressure in the right places for me! So it went back!"
5,Review,Excellent. It is just a renewal for an older version I have used for decades...with good results. Good self-healing/maintenance device.
4,I like it - husband hates it!,"I think this works pretty good. It did cause a little soreness in spots the first few times, but placing a towel over it before laying on it helped with that and now I can lay on it without difficulty. I only gave this 4 stars because I guess I thought it would help a little more than it does-but it still feels good.I suppose this device is not for everyone though. My husband could not lay on it at all and said it hurt (he's much bigger)."
2,Might work for some shorter folk,"If you are over 6 feet tall, this will not work for you. Not everyone's spine is one size fits all. If you are elderly, this product may give you some benefit as it can ""coach"" your spine into proper alignment and show you how it feels to have proper posture, but there is no good substitute for exercise and ergonomic furniture."
4,It Does Work.,"First use relieved a low back problem that four months of weekly chiropractic did not help with. This was cheaper than just two visits.I use it before bed for about 15 minutes and have much better mornings. I'm not totally pain free, but MUCH better. I do have to continue to use it. I can tell when I haven't."
3,Every little bit helps,"I'm not noticing a significant improvement in my quality of life, but between adjustments at the chiropractor's office it helps keep my in line."
4,My Chiropractor Liked It,"This item may take some getting used to, however, I had my chiropractor try it and she liked it immediately and basically endorsed it's use. She added that my lack of enough curve at the bottom of my spine could make it less comfortable at first for me than some others, comparing it to wearing orthotic shoes for the first time to help correct flat feet. So she felt it had benefit, I haven't felt any real difference after using it yet but that could be because I didn't have any twisted vertabra at that time. If I feel I need an adjustment in-between chiro. visits I'll try it again."
2,disappointed,"I bought this as a gift, this product is not adjustable and seems to be sized/ shaped for someone under 5'8 with quite a curve in their lower back. The person I bought this for is 6'1 and clearly it is too short and therefore very uncomfortable. Guess its now a tag sale item :("
3,"Not that great, but somewhat helpful","I bought this to hopefully reduce the frequency that I'd need to see a chiropractor. I'm not certain that it has accomplished that, but I have found it to give relief if I feel that my back has locked up. Like others, I have found a frustrating amount of difficulty in trying to get my vertebrae lined up inside of the foam, but you kinda develop a feel for how to do it after a while. I only hear cracking when I depress my chest, and often the same thing happens if I'm just lying on the ground. I do think that it helps in correcting the shape of the spine in two ways. One is to restore the curve of the spine. The other is that I think it helps reverse my slouching, the foam ridges acting like fulcrums pulling my shoulders back and pushing my spine in. Not sure if it was worth the price or hype, but it proved to be somewhat useful."
2,Warning,Do not use this product if you have established disk disease...Which i do have and using this product exacerbated my pain which lead to epidural injections.
2,The Spine Align,"Well, for me it's been a pretty lame product. I bought it hoping it would help with my morning lower back pain, but it doesn't seem to help at all. Maybe it does work for others who need a slight disk realignment (adjustment), but it really did nothing for me. I'll keep trying...if not, it's going on eBay ;)"
5,Love It!,At such a very cheap price this is a must have for those with back problems. In just a few minutes the muscle tension is gone from a long stressful day and if you happen to have a few misaligned vertebrae 9 times out of 10 this will straighten you right up. For less than $30 it's a no brainer.
3,may work for some,"My fiance and I bought this about a month ago and he really likes it. He says it helps with his back pain caused by lifting at work and he says it improves his poster. For me I was not so excited. It hurts when you first lay on it and another problem is trying to center your back. Centering your back on the middle sounds easy, but my fiance has the hardest time. I believe it is due to is scoliosis and that he is 6'3'', but he still says it works and he uses at least once a day."
1,Painful,"This is one of the most painful things I have tried. Not only did it make my back hurt more but left bruises and that is while taking it too my chiropractors office to make sure I was using it right. It may help some people out there but beware for some it is a torture device that only causes incredible pain. My doctor was appalled at what it did to me. He initially thought it might be a good idea, no longer. I am only 38 as well and in relatively good condition except middle back pain at times. Think very, very carefully before buying this."
3,review,Well I was a little disapointed that the product was made out of a plastic type resin and looked cheap but it really does work very well. I gave it a 3 because it does do what its intended purpose is.
2,not worth it,"i used it 3 times and had to go to the doctor for my back pain. i wish i didn't buy this thing. not really a fix for anything, just something to say you have i guess."
4,The jury is still out,"I am using this daily, and I have felt some improvement but not as much as some people say."
1,Buy only if you are healthy,"It's with a heavy heart that I'm giving this product one star because I think it can help a healthy person stretch and be more flexible, but even the healthy person would take risks using it.If you have any spinal issues, including shoulder, hip, and knee problems, avoid this. It puts a lot of tension on your back and if you should stretch or move in an unpredicted way, you'll definitely pull something out of alignment. If, after stretching, you get a knee problem, see your chiropractor or other health professional immediately!The instructions say that no one should stress you from the top (like, for example, a child, or maybe a really dumb significant other who wants to kid around) because the result could be severe injury. I believe that this is also true if you accidentally stretch in the wrong direction.That said, the device is well-made. I'm not convinced one size fits all. If you want to pursue it, do so under the advisement of someone you trust for your healthcare."
4,Simple and effective,"My husband often has a hard time getting to the chiropractor, and this works really well for him."
2,One Size does Not fot All.,"One Size does Not fot All.It's only 2 ft long, and way too curved at the tail bone, ok of your a Pygmy but I'm 6'2"" and it's about a foot to short. I would like a full refund or a 3' model.Buyer Beware!!!"
1,Not for those who have had back surgery,"Spine-Worx Back Realignment DeviceI had hoped after reading the rave reviews this device would help keep my spine aligned. Because of ruptured discs, I had three vertebrae fused two years go. When I laid down on the Spine-Worx Back Realignment, the pain was so great in the lumbar area where I had surgery I could not stay on it for even a minute. I tried changing positions, but none was any better. Perhaps if the bars were a little further apart and covered with a softer material it would have worked."
3,"not for people over 5'10""","This might be a great product for the average person. At 6'7"", it REALLY dosen't work well at all."
4,Really helps my back,I purchased this item because I had stopped going to chiropractor and my mid and upper back have started bothering me again. I use it daily and find that if really does help to alleviate the pain in my spine. I've only had it a few weeks but am already feeling relief. If you have back pain I would recommend that you give this a try.
3,SPINEWORX - I'M NOT CONVINCED YET,"We've owned the device for about two months now. While it does provide some relief, I'm not certain I'd rate it as high as some. I think I need more time to make a fair evaluation. Maybe I don't spend enough time on or maybe there is some other reason. My wife feels about the same way. More to come ..."
1,Creates Back Pain,This device is rock hard! I lay on it for a few seconds and had pain hours later. I thought it was spongey material when I bought it. I cannot see how this can possibly be anything but a trauma to a painful back.
4,Great for someone with a daily regimen,"The product helps us, when we remember to use it every day. We are still young so our routines are not set in stone or anything so it can be hard to remember to use it. I figure if we do stick with using it every day it will help us a lot more."
2,Not worth the price,"This product is decent at best.To me, it seemed the yellow part was too narrow.I had trouble balancing on it. I am 6'1"" and weight 180#, so it should not have been a problem.Most people probably won't be able to handle the discomfort/pain."
1,Horrible piece of equipment,"After recieving the device and reading through the literature, I found out that anyone with even slight scoliosis should not use the device. I attempted to follow the instructions and try it out anyway. It was very painful and probably did more harm than good with my type of back condition.If you are looking for a hard plastic channel that tries to conform/ realign your back by using your body weight to force everything into a predisposed alignment then this may be the tool for you. It was too painful for me."
1,"dont by this if you are under 5'4"" tall","i purchased this item and there was no indication that there were height restrictionsyou have to be over 5'4"" tall or you are too short to use thismine sits in the closet gathering dustit is also uncomfortable to lay on at any height"
1,Not for everyone,"I have chronic upper back problems from a car accident 2 years ago. I've been treating myself with an accupuncturist, yoga, massage, and muscle relaxants. During the use of the product for about 2 weeks, for about 15 minutes per day, I found that I could not walk properly without extreme pain in my lower back region. I have never had a lower back problem. I am 31 years old and very active, exercising for at least 60 minutes 5 times per week. After using this product, I found that sitting down was really uncomfortable. It has taken me approximately 1 week of stretching, yoga, and 1 treatment of accupuncture to be able to walk without pain. Again, use this product with caution."
5,Incredible!!!,"This is fantastic. My spine feels better than it has in 20 years!!! In the beginning you may feel discomfort, but once you relax into it, it's incredible. You need to slowly adjust your body, find your comfort zones. I almost gave up after the first 3 times because I did feel a little sore but I'm SO GLAD I didn't. All it took was some time and minor adjustments. I now use it at least 15 minutes a day. I've even noticed my jackets and clothes fit better. I haven't measured myself but based on my clothes I would swear I grew at least an inch. I've had extensive body work; massages, chiropractor, yoga, physical therapy. However, this is amazing how something so simple has been so effective (for me). I'm aware for others with more serious problems it may not help but for the average person it truly helps. I also sleep better and am more relaxed, yet energized thoughout the day, no more afternoon naps needed. I just love my Spine Worx!!!"
3,Its ok,"I always wanted to buy this device since I saw it advertised in my doctors office. So eventually I used both this and a similar device called back magic. They both work great. However, for lower back pain, Back magic works faster and more intensely and the item is way cheaper. So I just use that now and the spine worx gathers dust. But if you have whole spine issues the spine worx may be better deal."
5,Back ache reliever,"This spine-worx really does work. I was extremely frustrated and tired of being in pain. Along with the Back2Life Motion Massager, Lumbar back stretcher and the neck stretcher I have had increasingly help in finally relieving decades of living in pain."
3,"it's not great, but cheap.",I bought this at the same time that I bought my inversion table. This little thing was useless for me and is very difficult to get up off of unless you have someone help you. I live alone so I really had a hard time with it. If you roll off to the side it can hurt your back and trying to sit up can be nearly impossible too. I gave it to someone else who said it works for them so it wasn't a total waste of money.
4,I LOVED IT SINCE THE FIRST TIME!,"Well, I have lower back problems (herniated discs), so I have pain many days of my life; and who doesn't have a badly aligned back? This spine realignment device felt really good when I lied on it, but, differently to the majority of reviews that I've read, it didn't hurt at all and I didn't need to be careful while lying down there. And, in order to really feel the yellow sides touching around my spine, I even had to pull my legs towards my chest and keep moving my back there a little bit (side to side, on the spine), so that I could feel it doing its job and relieve the pain. I just don't give it 5 stars because, for me, I needed something even stronger than that."
3,Align my spine,I purchased this for my daughter who often complains of her back aching. She saw this online and wanted to try it. We have gone to the chiropractor but thought if we had something at home to use it may be helpful. She loves using this and feels better afterwards. I have tried it and it seemed a bit painful to me with the stretching so it may depend on the person. It has kept us from going to the chiropractor but I did feel the overall cost was a bit high.
4,A good spine stretch,Using this product does seem to stretch and release my spine. The design it seems to create a bit of traction when you're lying on it which elongates the spine. I like it
2,Buyer beware,"The device wasn't very relaxing and isn't very ""your-spine-specific"". I find it to be hard and uncomfortable. Very abrassive. After just one use, it felt like I had a bruise between my shoulder. I had to go to my doctor for him to realign me. It may work for some but not for everyone. Also, because it isn't really formatted for individuals, it seems dangerous."
2,Was worth the $ but didn't work,I ordered this with high expectations.. I layed on it for several 15 minute periods and tried to relax as best as possible. I don't think my spine aligned well with the product because the tread marks were off and on my actual spine and did not straddle my spine. I don't think it is easy to align the spine on this thing.... but I haven't given up. Worse case is that I give it to some other struggler.
3,works fine,"Seems to do what it says it does. (I haven't been using it daily.) Light weight, which is good, and uses gravity to help loosen the muscles around the spine, too, which can be really good. My only problem with it is rolling off of it, but I think I just need to practice that. Also, doesn't come with very useful instructions."
2,Hard to tell if my sipne is even in the grove???,"It is hard to tell if my spine is even in the grove? and for the first few days it made my back hurt 1,0000 times worse...hopefully it is going to get better by using it? only time will tell.and I am sleeping 1 night a week on the floor with my feet elevated."
2,Taking Up Space,"I ordered this product, because I am a long time sufferer of back, neck and shoulder pain. I have had surgery on my back, tried chiropractics, medications, etc. I saw this on Amazon and thought it sounded like an amazing idea. I was really excited when it arrived a couple days later, until my husband took it out of the box, and we both just looked at it. I kept telling him to have hope, it might just work. Well, he and I have both tried it, several times now, and it has caused more pain and stiffness than was there to begin with. It doesn't work on neck/shoulder pain, so it's basically designed just for your lower back... but once I get on that thing, it's nearly impossible to get off... it hurts!!! So... a pretty expensive piece of plastic setting in my bedroom is what it has become. I was very disappointed, to say the least."
2,"Be Careful, Why does your Back Hurt","I used this device, for my back problems. It did nothing, but caused more pain. Why, I had 1 herniated disc and 1, torn disc, Make sure the problem you have is not going be exacerbated by this device"
1,Not that Good,The directions are not clear at all. I think I can actually help my back more by simply laying flat on the ground.
2,Be careful,Bought this item and tried it. It hurt my back and was quite unsatisfactory and had to return it. I feel it has limited use and might even be dangerous if improperly used
1,One Size Does Not Fit All,This seems to be a joke on me! Please don't hurt yourself with this thing. It might work as a doorstop...
5,Superlative,"This is awesome anime. I havn't had this title for that long but have just about watched it twice all ready. The presentation of the story is very consistently stylish and intriguing or as the case says, ""it is a new hard-boiled style of science fiction entertainment"". The plot keeps you guessing with a web of different characters and organisations, all set in the mysterious world of lukuss but i'm not giving anything away. This anime is one of the best."
3,too much advertising fluff,"when i first bought the book, i thought i had got a real winner. there were ideas on brand building but limited to the companies which the author had direct contact. and they talk too much about advertising and their personal work ethics..ridiculous!"
2,Not very useful information,"The book assume and reader have a certain level of knowledge branding. It does not tell you how and why rather state only the what. The examples and case studies in this book is really pathetic. I feel that half of the book is certainly advertisement for the author's company. In conclusion, this book is definitely not worth reading if you do not have much time to spare.If you are serious about branding look somewhere else."
2,Very Disappointing,"I am involved and interested in marketing for high-tech companies and start-ups as a career and purchased this book to help me do very fast ""branding"" for a start-up. I was greatly disappointed to find most of the information relating to what is possible with technology such as fast information dissemination, and online collaboration, etc. That is good information for people who don't know this stuff is possible, but is not very useful for people looking for a marketing book that will tell you how to ""brand"" a product any faster than you would normally be able to do it.I would label the book a ""how to work more efficiently"" type book for the advertising industry. Not at all useful given its title."
4,Warp Speed Branding,"Considering how dynamic the marketing profession is, it is amazing to me what an incrustation of outdated myths it supports. Agnieszka Winkler's book is helpful in demolishing some of these, and in doing so helping readers learn how to think through their complex branding issues, whether they're involved in technology or more conventional products and services. ---Gerry Khermouch, Editor, Brandweek magazine"
4,Insightful!,"Advertising expert Agnieszka M. Winkler offers an insider’s perspective on how technology has changed marketing and advertising. Writing with clarity and confidence, she outlines the steps advertisers and marketers must take to keep pace. She cites high-profile companies like Dell Computers and Amazon as examples of brands that were built in months, not years. These examples illustrate her sometimes complex concepts, and make them more accessible. Unfortunately, she also devotes a large amount of space to what amounts to a commercial for an adverting software application that she’s trying to sell. But for readers who can stomach the pitch, we recommend this book to those who work in marketing, advertising, or related industries, and to those who are making the transition to technology-driven brand building. (Editor’s note: TeamToolz, one of the major resources covered in this book, is a pay-for-use service sold by the author.)"
4,Rethink is the core advice,"I never think that any book can offer perfect truth, especially in business disciplines. This book offers interesting examples and a new framework about branding issues. I truly believe that these are the experience accumulated by the author during all her past years. Even though I still believe that brand building and management needs quite a period of time, it is necessary for us to rethink how we should cope with the time compression environment. A good book is good because it can stimulate thinking, but not because it controls one's mind. In this aspect, the book does a good job."
5,Some really good tips and first-hand experiences,"Fun and easy to read, and I particularly enjoyed the first-hand stories from the new world of marketing, branding and advertising. The ""Myths of Branding"" section was particularly appealing to me. Not an academic approach, but pretty practical, including some tips and tricks that seem like they'd have real usefulness."
5,new ideas in every chapter-unlike most business books,interesting and provactive and I have already shared it with a couple of my collegues. I particularly liked the warp-speed quiz.
2,This product not recommended.,This was easy to hook up but one row of keys didn't work so the letters and numbers were not recognized. We had to package the keyboard back up and pay to ship it back.
5,VisiKey large print keyboard,This keyboard makes a huge difference. Like night and day. If you have just even a little difficulty seeing a regular keyboard I strongly suggest trying this.
5,Viskey Wired Keyboard,Excellent product. I can even see the keys in low light conditions without wearing my glasses. If and when this keyboard ever wears out I'm going to buy another just like it.
5,Very durable plate,"The MSR Alpine Plate is very rugged, easy to use and easy to clean. The lip around the edge of the plate makes it easy to hold while wearing gloves."
3,Stainless steel plate,"Based on looks, this is a nice looking plate. It seems okay thus far....it hasn't been very long since I've had it."
3,Detailed information is incorrect,"The MSR Alpine Plate is decent.But, it is not made in the US - as was stated in the product detailed information.It is made in Thailand."
3,A little small.,"Nice quality but would like the plate to be a bit bigger and deeper. Works fine for backpacking, but not as well for camping."
4,Good cat food plate,"I bought this to use as a cat food plate. My vet recommended stainless steel after the cat had an allergic reaction to the plastic and ceramic plates I'd been using.It's a good size, and it's nice having a bit of edge/lip on the plate to help contain the food. I didn't give it five stars, because even after washing it several times in the dishwasher some of the adhesive is still there."
1,One of the very bad movies/dvds of the year!!!,"Meandering, plotless and ugly mess with no redeeming values whatsoever. the picture quality of the DVD was like it was transferred from an old VHS tape filmed without any appropriate lighting. I could not ever understand how this film ever got funding in the first place."
1,Ugh!,A boring film by a self-indulgent writer/director/producer -- whoever's responsible for this mess. What a pity we can't rate negative stars.
1,Pecular movie,"This movie wanders and can't decide if it's the story of the principal character, Brian, or a travelogue about Carnival in Panama. I noted that Matthew Leitch is one of the producers on this film, so he certainly can't say ""I didn't know what I was getting in for."" Leitch is a fine actor though one wonders if his career is in the toilet which is why he chose to do multiple nude scenes along with the most brazen full-frontal [...] scene even undertaken outside of a porno flick. His character is obviously a troubled and confused young man, though this film does nothing to resolve his issues, or really tell you what they are. This is truly a film that leaves the viewer with ""Huh?"""
2,at least 60% padding,"Yes, it's true that this book is more than just a list of websites, as other reviewers have pointed out, but the ""more"" is mostly padding. I'm glad I checked this one out of the library instead of buying it. It did have a couple of useful things to say about creating an online portfolio, and the list of websites is helpful, but other than that I found fluff, fluff and more fluff. Like 80 pages on the history of freelancing. It would have been much more useful if, say, the author had interviewed people who actually hire freelancers via the internet to find out how they go about it, and what they are looking for when they do."
1,Save your money,"This book is essentially a list of 30 Job Search web sites. The author obviously had a good idea for a book, spent a week looking up job search web sites on a search engine, and rated the first 30 that he found. Why he would incude the bad web sites is beyond me. 20% of the links were either dead or linked to other sites that were also rated. Only 1 or 2 had freelance opportunities and nothing to write home about.The book is too $ to return, but believe me - save your money. thought I would do a kindness by preventing others from wasting their money."
4,Realy good trail mix,This stuff is great. I take it to work for a healthy snack. Only problem is that it's so good I tend to eat too much. I've boughten this twice and will buy more soon.
3,Haven't watched it yet,I thought I was ordering a poster. Thought it would be too much hassle to return it. My 14 yr old loves n'sync so I kept it as an additional gift for her
1,The joke was on us!,"After falling in love with Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes,"" I went hunting for more stories of Irish life and thought this book would be a funny gift for my dear husband on St. Patrick's Day.'Twould have been a kinder joke if the book description would have included the fact that indeed there is not one word included in the text--simply blank pages.Know what you're buying--'tisn't the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow"
1,Buy this only if you don't like having money,"This so called book is the biggest pile rubbish I've ever seen. Here in Ireland, the average age for losing your virginity is 14. On average, each adult in Ireland under the age of 25 has had sex with at least 17.4 different people (Source: CSO). The book contains nothing but blank pages. But it only if you are a fool"
5,This book is incredible. Highly recommended.,"I have found Nicola Upson's book on the sculptures of Helaine Blumenfeld one of the most remarkable art/coffee table creations I have ever come across. Why? Because it is such an incredible combination of first rate photographs, highly intelligent and well-written text, and superbly crafted marble and bronze sculptures by an artist who obviously can think as well as sculpt. (The jacket says she was a professor of philosophy & that may explain why she is so verbally fluent.) What amazes me is that this book has not received a prize for the best art book of the year? (Maybe it has and I have not found it?)""Maayan Becker-Reshef."
1,Good book to leave on the shelf.,I read a few other books about this and then I read this one. This book helped me change my mind about what I was going to do. It was something thoughtless and it probably would have done a lot of damage to my self and my spouse who I don't want to lose. I'm on to some healthy stuff.
5,Writing Ed 101,"This book is well done and full of great study illustrations to cement each lesson into place. Very helpful for a writer, or a writer to be. This book was copyrighted back in 2002 and we've read all of Brandilyn Collin's works prior to reading this guide, so we know she not only knows the subject well, but practices it in her writing. She is a very talented write because all her books hold you on the edge of your seat and it's difficult to set them down for a minute."
4,Great gym bag,"This bag is great for people who need a lot of organizing space for their gym stuff. Lots of pockets, yoga mat holder is great, bottle holder fits all standard sized gym and water bottles. The only con is that if it is not filled, the bag tends to fall on itself."
5,One Great CD!,"This is one of the best Punk/ Pop/ Rock / just great music cd I have ever listioned to. This CD is full of great lyrics, great melodies, and just all around great music. I strongly recomend buying this very well produced CD. It is one of the catchyest CD's I have ever heard. The great songs just come one after another, once you listion to this master piece, the hooks will never leave your head (and thats a good thing!) Any ways, buy this CD, it will be one of your fav. CD's in your collection"
3,A Necessary End review,"This author has much potential in the crime genre however he needs to develop his own style, not take quite as much from other authors such as Ian Rankin At the moment also the final denouement is fairly predictable( I have read 11 so far & predicted every one). Having said that these books improve each time and I recommend them as a very good read. I love the Yorkshire landscape and culture and find this an added attraction in Robinsons' work"
2,Disappointing,"I loved Peter Robinson's ""Gallow's View."" ""A Dedicated Man"" slipped a bit. Now there's this one, which I didn't even finish. Too much procedure, not enough Banks. Not enough Jenny. The poor wife is nonexistant. That's where the story lies, not with Maggie's Farm. I will try some more Banks, but I don't know if I can keep going if they fail to engage."
4,Another fine police procedural,"When a demonstration goes out of control, many demonstrators and policemen are left wounded and one constable is found stabbed to death. With over 100 demonstrators, Inspector Banks has his work cut out for him. We meet Jenny Fuller, the psychologist, again, though this time not in a professional capacity. She is dating one of the many suspects of the crime. Is this a crime of passion? Or is it a more sinister premeditated murder using the demonstration as a facade? Banks deals with a number of a fleshed out characters which the reader will quickly empathize with. It is page turner and true to the police procedural form."
5,She did it again!,Acker again kept me in suspense until the end! Just when I think I have it all figured out she twists the story! It amazes me that she connects both books with different locations and different characters but one simularity...Raven! Great Job!Let's have the third!
5,"A Reader From Shoreview, Minnesota","Beware the Serpent is great! Loved it and recommend it, can't wait for the next one. The characters are real, smart, sassy, and some are dangerous. Put it on your summer reading list!"
5,Great sound And Product,This is a great Compact sterio. It has the best sound EVER!!! It is very simple to use even though it has so many features. I recomend this one to any one who wants a sterio worth every cent
2,Buy it ONLY if you own a restaurant or a bar,"Saint Grmain compilations , especially the Des Pres Cafe no.5 are excellent , while trying to leave the nü jazz or electro jazz scene they move to Lounge music , its so pathetic short time runned and poor quality editing it.Play it in a restaurant bar or bookshop"
1,Microsoft lackey,"This book is written by the guy who appeared as an expert witness for MS in the anti-trust proceedings. When asked by a government prosecutor if he knew of any operating systems (other than MS brand OS's) that would cease functioning if you removed the browser component (as MS claims for Windows) he replied, ""Yes. KDE"".Of course, as the government prosecutor pointed out, KDE isn't an OS, but a desktop environment that runs on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Pressed for other examples, he replied, ""Uhh, GNOME?"" GNOME is, of course, KDE's major competition as a Unix desktop. In this context, Madnick might as well have just blurted out ""KDE"" again.Consider this an object lesson in what can happen to your credibility if you sell yourself to tell someone else's lies for them.(btw, I haven't read this book & never will. I just thought any prospective buyers should know the preceding bit of info)"
5,Excellent!,"I love this product! I have been using it for years. It's perfect on the body, especially if you work out and wear your hair down (dancing, performing, etc.) You can spray this on your back to avoid possible break outs caused by hair products or creams mixing with 'workout sweat'. Very effective."
1,looked like it was opened and sitting on the shelf for years,"The seal on this bottle was broken, and the bottle looked cheap and filthy like it was sitting on the shelf for years.The spray was no more effective than locally bought at the grocery store with the same ingredients.The bottle could spray upside down, but that's the only positive thing about this overpriced medicine I can think of."
1,Does Not Spray,"I received the product on time and the packaging was fine, but the bottle does not spray. It does not work and I am unable to open to poor into another bottle."
1,bad product and not working,"Some people have reviewed this as working for their skin, but I think its too basic and week.The acid level is only 0.5%. This level might actually be better for people with sensitive skin, but if you often use 2% or higher sylical acid, then this product is over priced.-Have been using it for 2 months with no improvement!"
2,Not very effective..,"I have moderate to severe back/body acne. I've used this product as directed, starting off with one application and working it up to 2-3 times daily but haven't seen any improvement. It does have a 'cool' feeling on the skin that's really nice but it has done nothing for my acne problem. Not a very happy customer!"
3,Clarifying body spray,"I thought it might help with what I intended to use it on but it really didn't make a difference. I have super sensitive skin so it burned when I applied it. You never know it may work for you, everyone is different. You have to try something in order to know if it'll work for you."
4,Works but takes time,"I suddenly broke out on my back and needed something to cover it up. this spray is convenient to use and does not leave any marks on your clothes. the reason I gave it 4 stars is that, it takes time to show results."
1,Didn't work for me,"This product didn't help clear up my acne on my back, in fact it made it worse....."
5,THE BEST.,"I've used hundreds of products to cure by back acne for several years.This is hands down the best product ever made.If you're trying to cure your back acne, don't even look around for more.This is the best product for your back!"
4,helped me a lot!,"i've always had oily skin and the only time my back would clear up is when i went tanning...i don't want to keep hurting my skin so i needed to find an alternative. This is the only thing that actually did clear it up, i've been using it a few weeks and its not totally gone (it was mild to begin with) but it's getting there!"
2,Maybe it's too mild for my skin.,"I thought I'd try this instead of the Glytone 2% Back Acne Spray. It doesn't work on me, but I'll keep it for an astringent.I had to buy the Glytone. . .that clears up my back acne right away."
3,Get Real PrepTest Questions,"As one of the other reviewers pointed out, the questions used for prep in this book are very different from the actual LSAT questions that you'll be tested on. Not only are the style of writing and the format of the questions different in LSAT 180 than on an actual LSAT exam, but also, an equally persuasive case could be made for more than one of the answer choices in some of LSAT 180's Kaplan-created questions. The same isn't true on an actual LSAT exam (or is very rarely true) because once the subtleties of actual PrepTest questions are mastered, there is almost always a clearly superior answer. On LSAT 180, I found myself unconvinced in several instances by Kaplan's explanations as to why their preferred answer choice was superior to one of the other answer choices available. This never happens on a real LSAT PrepTest once you have grasped the stimulus and the question stem, with all their subtleties."
3,It is good for....,"This book is likely to be unhelpful to a lot of people...The logical reasoning sections are fragmented in an unhelpful manner and moreover, the structure of the questions is nowhere near as succinct as the real questions on the LSAT.Admittedly, this book has some good logic game problems and decent solutions for them. If you want a decent lsat book with a variety of problems, then buy this used/barely used here for $10-12 but realize beforehand that you will not be getting one of the better books on the market."
1,Get a dictionary!,"I usually finish all books that I read, but at page 70, I said, ""ENOUGH!""1. This book is very clinical and boring.2. I am an average reader and my husband above average with college education. The words used in this book are ridiculous! Get a dictionary if you read it!3. After reading through page 70 and reading about the first chapter on the first ""Type"" of mom, I quit reading, because the descriptions of the mom were so vague. I found nothing useful at all.4. So spread out and so wordy. I think the 70 pages I read could have been summed up in about 25 pages."
3,Print too light,"I'm sure this book had good information, I just couldn't read any of it due to the faint, light, print. Sent back since I couldn't read it."
2,Disappointed--Some good thoughts buried in the usual,"The author makes some good points, and I like the way she creates ""characters"" representing the most frequent means of adaptation by both mothers and daughters, but the vast majority of this book seemed like every other self help book I've read. If you haven't read many I would recommend it, but if you have I'd say pass."
3,Decent but Dated,"This was a decent book but not for my generation.The personal stories and descriptions of different kinds of mothers that Victoria Secunda paints is a largely black or white portrait of the mother and daughter relationship that does not leave enough gray area for the average reader to fill in her own blanks.Also, the book itself was written for the Baby Boom generation, my mothers generation, and many of the stories, explanations, were geared directly at that age group so I found that I had problems identifying with who the author was talking to. While many books of this type are universal this is not one of those."
5,Very insightful!,"I thought the book was very insightful, the description of the different types of mother's was right on, as well as the daughters. And the action steps at the end were also quite helpful. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is having a difficult time with their mother and is looking to make sense and try to resolve the issue (vs. carry around blame on others)."
3,When You And Your Mother Can't Be Friends,This is not a very good book in terms of a tool to work through a difficult relationship between a mother and a daughter. I gave it three stars in that is is written well and is an easy read. I did not however find the advise I was looking for to enhance my relationship with my daughter. I would not recommend this book.
3,"If you're not a boomer, this may not be for you","I am a part of Gen X (or the MTV generation depending on who you ask) and a lot of the information in this book is geared towards having been raised by a woman who considered a woman's place to be in the home. If you, like me, were raised by a woman who taught you to be all you can be, to stay independent, and who otherwise did not meet the stereotypes portrayed in this book, then it may not be for you."
5,When You and Your Mother Can't Be Friends: Resolving the Most Complicated Relationship of Your Life,"I found this book invaluable. I read this book as if it were fiction. Each night I couldn't wait to read it. I was so relieved to hear about real life stories of other women with awful relationships with their mothers.I found this book to be very helpful for sorting out disfunctional childhoods. For me, all the chaos was finally nice and neatly outlined and I could put everything in a box and store it away or even burn the box if I wanted. But the greatest part of all was the classification of the different ways mothers and daughters behave. All the craziness and random bad fellings finally had ownership and names. A great book for sorting every thing out.I would recommend this book to anybody with issues with their Mothers form light to heavy, this book covers it all. Fabulous!"
1,B movie disaster,"I watched this movie recently and fully knew what I was expecting. A B movie that was tongue in cheek and that would have a lot of laughs. I was wrong. The whole story was a waste of time, the monsters a joke and the characters-better off dead. The premise is that a director goes into the woods to refilm his movie after he was told to put more sex and violence in it. However, one by one the cast are being killed off.I was disappointed with this and would urge you not to buy it-unless you want to waste an hour and a half of your life."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"The only good thing about this book is the answers to the questions came with explainations. If I had to rely on this book to pass the A+ exams I would never pass. The questions are poorly written and hard to understand. The terminology used is different from that which is used on the exams and in other books. If you must buy a book, buy the Myers book and/or the dummies book. Too bad there is no option for 0 starsE. Wong-A+ certified now"
4,"A great test prep book, hammers home the needed info","I bought two books this and M.Myers A+ cert book. this seemed the most valuable. With all the info out there you can't learn evrything, so start by learning just what will be on the test. Best feature was its description of correct and incorect ans. at end of each chapter. The cheap price does not reflect the books quality. Hint: if you have not memorized allIRQ's, Modem commands, and mem address's of LPT1,2 and COMM1,2 your not ready to take the test"
5,NOT ABOUT THE VIDEO INPUTS; Suround and Audio features,"This receiver has the capability of outputting stereo (and 6-channel multi-stereo). ""virtual"" surround if you are into that.It has video inputs and outputs.This is a 6.1 surround receiver (the 6th channel has two outputs so it's like 7.1...unless you have 7.1; you can wire it for one speaker, which is right behind your head; 2 is better). It has a multi-channel input for Advanced Resolution(up to 192/24) and/or DSD for DVD-Audio and/or SACD (or even AC-3).PCM 1.0 and 2.0 up to 48/24Dolby Pro Logic and Pro Logic II up to 48/24Dolby Digital EX 1.0,2.0,4.0,5.1, & 6.1 up to 48/24dts 96/24dts 2.0,4.0,5.0, & 5.1dts-es & dts-es matrix 6.1Audiophiles are gonna like this."
5,Bear Hugs for this Charming Book of Poetry,The talented husband and wife team of Michael and Kathleen Hague have once again created a delightful treasure for the nursery library. This precious little book is just right for a bedtime reading with 9 short poems and 23 colorful and engaging illustrations featuring little ones and their favorite teddy bears and toys. Some pretty stars and moons are sprinkled throughout to add a touch of magic. It is short and sweet and many of the illustrations are full page so it will certainly hold the interest of little ones. It would make a lovely new baby gift.
5,Bear Hugs,"The book, ""Bear Hugs"" by Kathleen Hague, was exactly what I expected and wanted.The condition of the book was excellent. It arrived in a good time frame.This book is no longer in print, and I was so excited to know that I could obtain it for a new baby in the family to enjoy as much as my children enjoyed it when it was first published.Thank you~"
2,Romantic look at SW interiors w/ little architectural design,"Cute colorful book. However, it is not what I envisioned from the reviews. It is all about decoration design studies and furnishings. If you want to see how to set a table, arrange items on a crowded shelf, hang antiques on a wall, then this book is for you. Unfortunately, this is NOT what I was looking for. Apparently, there is little in the way of comprehensive SW/pueblo style architectural and style books available. My search continues!"
2,a big disappointment,"This book should probably be called ""gated communities"" rather than ""hidden homes"" - the homes photographed are the super-expensive vacation retreats of people who only live in the area periodically. These interiors are the work of professional designers, static ""museum spaces"" for the art collections of movie producers and ex-fashion models. The book is sadly lacking in the integrity and spirit of the people who actually live in the area, where a distinctive architectural and decorative style has evolved over thousands of years of human habitation.It would be a pleasure to see a book about northern New Mexico houses that are designed, built, or lovingly restored by people who actually live in the area."
4,Nice photography!,"I am a native New Mexican and even though the others did comment on how nice a book about ""real"" New Mexicans would be, I do love this book for the excellent photography. It is on my coffee table now and I just love looking at it!"
1,Behind Adobe Walls The hidden Homes and Gardens of Santa Fe and Taos,"this the forth time tonight that i have tried to fill out this review. I did not receive the book. I paid for it through pay pal. I filed a claim for this item through amazon. But never heard from you. I just want the book but I will not pay for it again. When I filed the clain it showed that the seller did not have a tracking # next to the missing tracking # you had a question mark. there is no way to even know if seller even mailed it.Please fix this problem.I have bought a lot of things and have never had any problems.Please fix this. I really want this book, Thank you Karen Young"
3,Buenas ideas pero dificil de leer,El libro ofrece muchas ideas brillantes sobre la naturaleza humana. Pero quizas no me interese demasiado la teoria de la inteligencia creadora. Encuentro que el libro es muy dificil de leer. Es dificil leerlo; y todavia no he terminado.
2,not nearly what I expected.,What a dissapointment. There are 18 still photos showed over and over to some Carlos Nakai music. The only good part is that it's Nakai music but I feel ripped off with this few photos. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
2,Ultimate Missions not so ultimate,"When I order the Ultimate Missions: Rebel Storm book I couldn't wait to try it out. Alot of the senarios in the book looked really neat but in practice they weren't all that great. The missions are very one sided so that the senario will play out just like it happens in the movie. Very good for realists but not very fun for playing a game. The only good thing about the book is the last chapter. It has alternate game play rules, stats for additional equipment that comes with the book, and a random senario generator. The only way I would pick this book up is if you don't pay very much for it."
2,DOES NOT WORK ON XBOX 360,"I know this game is awsome, and i have it on the ps2 and maxed it out. But i wanted to get it on the xbox, cuz i really like to play original xbox games right now. However, the regular version of MK Deception works on the 360.. But the kollectors edition... does not. Unfortunately they are 2 different games so unless ur playing this on the original xbox or if u just absolutely love MK and wanna Kollect stuff... Then its pretty much junk.. And i found out the hard way because i bought it recently. And unfortunately it didnt come with the tin card and bonus disc. Thats another thing to watch out for."
5,Great Game,"I love the Mortal Kombat franchise, and thought this was another great addition. I have spent hours upon hours playing, and never get tired of it."
5,A Spiritual Blessing!,"This video will definitely bring you closer to God! Yolanda is an anointed woman. This is a great worship & praise video. Some of the titles on this video include: My Everything, Through the Storm & Just a Prayer Away. It is a must have!"
5,A great rolling cooler,"I am a personal chef and am always looking for tools to make my job more efficient. This rolling cooler really fits the bill. It carries quite a full load (more than you'd think!), along with plenty of ice to keep things cold. Highly recommended, and at a great price!"
4,Very Good Performance,"I bought this DVD player for my run-of-the-mill 19"" TV expecting average picture and ok sound, given that my TV is neither progressive scan nor digital. But I was amazed at how wrong I was, the picture and sound, even though they're analog, have the quality of digital. The price, too, is really good, especially with the free Die Another Day DVD I got with it. This DVD player is definitely a good buy for anyone who wants good quality for a good price. My only complaint is the layout of the front panel. I was pressing the power button for a while before I realized that it was the power button. The label is very discrete and it is in a bad place, right next to the disk tray. I should expect that an eject button would be there and the power button would be on the opposite side of the DVD player, were the eject button is. Overall, it is a great deal!"
2,Not so great,"My first gripe is it takes so long to start up. It takes about 5 seconds until you can open tray. Plus, you can't open the tray until the unit is turned on. Most DVD players allow you to open the tray w/ unit off, thereby turning on the unit at that point. Not this player. You have to turn the unit on, wait 5 seconds, then open the tray. This is not a typical Philips DVD player. Now, of course, this player is outdated with its features/technology. Unless you don't care about the newest and greatest sound and picture features and it is practically being given away, get a different player."
5,Rocks!,"Awesome game! It's Mortal Kombat! This game has many backgrounds from MK1 and MK2 remade in 3d, and includes Konquest (3d Adventure Mode), Puzzle (Terish-ish), and Chess (Chess but with MK Fighting in the mix).The characters are a mixed bag. Older characters like Ermac, Kabal, Liu Kang Scorpion and Tanya return and look great, while Sub-Zero and Raiden loo like crap. The new characters, save for Ashrah who's a tough character to fight and Kira, are lamer than hell and have dumb names like Darrius and Dairou, and KOBRA?!?!?!? A Ken rip-off from Street Fighter 2.Bottom line is, this is a big, fun game and it will keep you occupied for awhile. Grab it!"
5,"If You're An MK fan, you'll love this game","if anyone loves mortal kombat deadly alliance, they'll love this game better. the makers of this game brought back the old characters such as jade, mileena, baraka, kabal, and many more. the graphics are great, the fatalities are great, and the puzzle kombat and chess kombat are superb. all mk fans should buy this game."
4,"3/4"" spiked brown leather harness review","The Finishing of the harness does not match the promotional image, although ¡my cocker look great wearing it!Size matched perfectly. Spikes are of very good quality. If I could ask for more will be to add spikes on the top, as they are to protect my dog from attacks."
4,A round look at spiritual warfare,Dr. Murphy displays a rich depth of spiritual warfare information. IF one takes the time to look to the Scripture references and notates questions and ideas while reading; Ephesians will come into dramatic light as the book of Spiritual warfare in the Bible. Dr. Murphy shows a variety of useful information that can show the seriousness of the world in which we live - a battleground. Murphy looks at a wide range of practical examples within the Old and New Testament as proof to clear ideas.CSL
5,Just the Appendices are worth the price of the book,"This book offers instructions on how to deliver and sustain yourself and your loved ones from the bondage of the evil one.To finish this long book is a spiritual struggle in itself, but well worth the outcome; don't overlook the appendices:Appendix A - The Daily Affirmation of Faith (unleash the incomprehensible power of God in your life)Appendix B - Warfare Prayer (Stand against Satan and command him out of your life in the name of Jesus Christ)Appendix C - Group Deliverance Prayer (As a group exorcise the worker of iniquity)Appendix D - Requirements for Deliverance and Staying Free (Freedom from the clutches of the father of lies)Appendix E - How I Learned to Pray for the Lost (Effective intercession for the lost)"
4,Clear and unalarming,"This book is clear and to the point it also uses the bible as the basis for its treatment of the matter, which is critical. I would recommend this to anyone with a desire to learn about this type of ministry. Most of all I like the basic and level headed method used in its preparation. Good Book! Buy it."
5,Two Words. Black Zahn,Two Names that justify a purchase. This is Comedy that deserves more views. I Watched this on Comedy Central & I Bought the DVD the next day. The Cast is Hilarious. This Should be in your Comedy Collection.
4,2 Best Friends + 1 Girlfriend= War!!,"Darren Silverman, Wayne Lefessier, and J.D. McNugent have been best friends since the fifth grade. Enter Judith, a cold-hearted beauty who digs her claws into sweet-natured Darren. She snatches him from his friends and even breaks up their cover band. J.D. and Wayne try every imaginable scheme to save Darren-and their friendship-but fail miserably. When they find out Darren has been brainwashed into marrying Judith, the dim-witted duo decide to kidnap her and reunite Darren with his long-lost love, before she becomes a nun!This movie is all out Hilarious!! Some of the things that are said make you feel as if your on an edge of your seat laugh fest! The outtakes in the special features section is great! I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a great comedy!!***Check it out!***"
3,Crazy,"Steve Zaun and Jack Black make a killer team. Lots of laughs and this verison has parts not in the original. Amanada Peet does a hell of a job in this, and has perfected the stuck up pretty girl role. Well worth buying."
4,Surprisingly Hilarious!,"I originally saw the PG-13 version and thought it was OK. However, one night I rented the R-Version and couldn't stop laughing. I couldn't believe how much stuff they took out to give you the PG-13 version. While the R-version is not for a younger crowd, it definately raises this version from 2 stars to 4!"
1,Go back! Do not waste your money!,"This definitely has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in some time. What was supposed to be funny about this movie??? If you're a Jack Black or Steve Zahn fan, check it out only when it hits the old releases shelves at the video store since they both do fairly decent jobs with roles that are horribly written. Don't waste more than a buck or two on watching this lame excuse for a movie. Go back and watch High Fidelity, Happy, Texas, or American Pie if you're a fan of Black, Zahn, or Biggs instead of this awful movie."
1,Hideously Awful,"This was just an awful movie. The fault COMPLETELY lies with the writers, the script made use of well-tread sitcom devices (receiving ""coaching"" during a date using a body mike and earpiece) and ""humor"" that, at best, could be compared to the jokes and banter that is written for award shows. Jack Black (High Fidelity) is usually a funny actor but he is handicapped by some of the worst dialogue material in his career. The movie's lone shining moment was the performance of Amanda Peet...her facial expressions and icy dialogue were perfect for her role. It is not often that I will turn a movie off halfway through, but the aforementioned ""date coaching"" was too much. Don't waste your time, and pray that the actors involved will not suffer too much for this travesty."
4,"""saving silverman"" esta una pelicula mucho bueno","en los estado unidos, mas a las peliculas es muy horrible. Muy muy mal. pero "" saving silverman"" esta muy muy chistoso y muy bueno. yo quiero la pelicula por que el actors y una acrtiz es muy muy fabuloso y yo mucho quiero neil diamond. compran""saving silverman"" por favor, tu no muy triste con tu desisione."
1,How Can they Make somthing like this,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER.....what a waste of 2 hours of my life.....What is thier sick obssesion with Neil Diamond.....Can I say the Jokes are stupid not even the funny stupid that makes you laugh the stupid that makes you cry
2,Disappointing,"The general idea of this dumb teen comedy is that a group of three friends have been broken up by one of the friends' girlfriend. I watched this movie because I'm a fan of Jack Black, but this movie doesn't work on so many levels. First of all, you never really get the feeling that the friendship between these three friends is really very strong. So when they start kidnapping and planning murder, you don't really understand why they're going to all the trouble. Another thing is the obsession with Neil Diamond. It's never really funny and it just falls flat. Third, the chemistry between the supposed romantic interests is terrible. The characters are all supposed to be in such deep love, but you never see it in this movie. If you're interested in comedy, you can find lots of better movies than this. For Jack Black fans, head for High Fidelity, or School of Rock instead."
5,Most people love it or hate it,"For me, this is a ""feel good"" moive. I have to watch it whenever it's on a movie channel (I don't like the edited version). Funny gags, Jack Black, great cameos, funny gags. No body gets hurt. Happy ending. Just a fun, comedy. Some of my women friends don't like it. Just FYI, I guess it may be a guy flick :)"
4,Laugh out loud stupid humor works,"You know those movies that are just so stupid you can't help but laugh... here is a classic example. Jack Black adds a lot to this movie, although not as much as to a movie like High Fidelity. Black, Biggs and Zahn definately put together a 'stupid comedy' all should see, and see multiple times. Although I have to be honest my favorite part of this movie were the Neil Diamond cameos."
5,I think this is a funny DVD.,You gotta get this. This is some seious funny stuff.I laughed all the way through. jack black is funny.the others are funny too. The R: rated version is the best.Get the R rated DVD. It has good features and is funny.
4,scared me,I watched this movie and it scared me - it was like watching a documentary about two men I know. If only I could save them like Jason Biggs was saved!
3,A avrege movie,"It was funny, but it was not extremly good it was just a avrege movie.I say if you like most or all comidys then you will really like this movie but other wise youprobably wont think it is that good."
1,Sorry Silverman,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after I saw the pre-views. I moved to England before it came out in theatres, so I had to wait until last Nov when I was home visiting my family. (FYI, due the recent popularity of Jack Black, ""Saving Silverman"" released in England Jan '02 under the name ""Evil Woman."")What a let down! This is one of those situations where they showed all the funny bits in the preview. This movie couldn't be more not funny if it tried. It's saddens me cause I really like all the actors in it. Don't waste your time or money because this movie is awful. It was like they were trying very hard to be clever, but it ended up being a bad copy knock-off of other film greats such as ""Something About Mary"" and/or ""American Pie."" If left me feeling bored and disappointed. And I have a GREAT sense of humor!"
5,One of the funniest movies ever!!!,"If you want to watch a movie and laugh so hard that at the end your face hurts, then Saving Silverman is the movie for you. Steve Zahn and Jack Black play Silverman's hilarious best friends. These guys are so funny you'll laugh just watching them run. Amanda Peet provides the cynical humor as playing Darren Silverman's (Jason Biggs) girlfriend. The movie is worth watching just to stare at Peet and Amanda Detmer. The movie has a pretty original story and wity comedy. Get the R-rated version. I went to SU...Subway Univesity."
2,saving silverman,"This was a gift to a family member. I hope the dvd is intact, because when I received the product most of the case was cracked. If it was packed better that would not have happened. As far as the dvd being ok, the person hasen't opened the package yet. I hope there is not a problem. Sorry for the review."
3,SILLY & FUNNY IF YOU LIKE THE CAST!,"I have always been a fan of Jack Black and I have liked Steve Zahn in all the films I've seen him in. This goofy comedy has many funny moments, so if you like the cast it's worth checking out. The R rated version isn't all that much different, but in these types of comedy the raunchier the better!"
2,VHS kills this movie,"As good as the movie is (and I did think it was funny), the VHS version of this movie simply .... There's no better way to explain it. It just stinks on ice. It's a really good example of why DVD is going to kill VHS in the long run. To begin with, the first 20 minutes of the VHS tape is filled with trailers and advertisements for other films, and special offers from Columbia Studios. Then, when the movie finally does begin, it's chopped to pieces. They've taken so many scenes out of this movie that I kept re-winding to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. The DVD has all scenes intact, just as the movie appeared in the studio. My suggestion is to let VHS die, and buy the DVD. It's cheaper, cleaner, and you get deleted scenes and director's commentary."
5,great !!!,when i saw this movie iloved it's great i don't know why all the critics said it was bad the dvd is great i highly recomend it
1,I can't stand these new Hollywood movies anymore,"being entertained by this movie is like laughing at people who have unfortunate miserable problems. That untalented pie lover (Jason Biggs) from ""American Pie"" stars in it, as a non-dimensional character, along with Amanda Pest, who plays his psychotic controlling girlfriend. The same movie ""comedy"" formula that has been used since 1991 makes it very predictable. Bathroom humor, heh heh.. seen that B4."
1,Not Too Good,"I thought it would be alot better. I watched it with my 13 year old son, who enjoys almost any movie, and my wife: we all said the same-too light of a comedy. Not worth watching, even if Jack Black is in the movie."
1,So dumb.,"Saving Silverman is just horrible! The only actor that is good in this garbage is Amanda Peet, she is crazy and likeable even when she's playing a bi$%h. Jason Biggs continues to play a dunce and Jack Black over does it as usual. Steve Zahn is pretty good but you expect him to play a doofus. This movie is lame and pointless, don't see it!"
1,Boring................,"Let me conclude concisely. This movie is really boring. May be it is a good movie for killing time but not the movie to enjoy. The plot is really silly and jokes aren't funny at all, the girl in the movie is hot, though... Anyway, if U wanna spend good time watching movie, avoid this one."
1,Unamusing...Stupid and Dull!!!,"Coming from the UK where movies such as Road Trip, American Pie enjoyed such great success, I eagerly awaited the US release of Saving Silverman. Well...was I disappointed!! I can honestly say the film failed to make me laugh once, and turned into an hour and a half long bore. Dont be fooled by the R rating which is a ridicilous attempt to make you the viewer purchase this DVD. It remains a stupid teen flick, while even the great Neil Diamond cannot rescue this dire movie. If you`re looking for laughs, leave this on the shelf...."
4,Jack Black is GOD!!!This movie is GOOD!!,"This movie is really funny, is not the best comedy out there but is a good one. All the actors are great in this movie, Jason Biggs plays the good guy very well, Zahn and Black are great as the 2 guys that doesn't want to loose their friend Biggs to Amanda Peet, who does a good job as the evil character. The Story is FUN and it has some twist and turns along the way.If you like the actors, buy the movie, if you don't at least give it a try and go rent it."
1,Probably One of the Worst Movies Ever Made,"This film suffers from the worst thing a comedy can suffer from: namely not being funny. The humorless script was disjointed and had the production values of a first year mail order film school student project. The plot held out some possibilities, but was lost in a morass of bad writing and uneven (at best) performances. Save your money, it would be better to stare at a blank screen."
1,are you kidding?,"I can't believe anyone could write a good review for this movie. It's absolutely terrible and i even like stupid comedies. I watch stupid comedies every week, but this one is just stupid. I felt like shouting to the cast what they should be saying instead of the absolutely dull script. I love the entire cast of this movie too. That's why it bothers me so much i guess. If you like fluffy comedies, get josie and the pussycats, not this."
1,Learn from mistakes!,"I recently purchased a JVC HRS3902U VCR that was supposedly in good condition. It was a little more than I wanted to pay but since you can't buy a new VCR anymore, I opted for this assuming the price meant it would be good! Wrong! After being used just a few times it started having a loud background noise of the tape running during viewing. It also needs a head cleaning after viewing about 4 videos. Seems a little bit of overkill to me. Not at all what I feel is a good bargain. Sounds inferior, but have always like the JVC's I have gotten before. Guess you learn from your mistakes. However, this is the first item I've ordered from Amazon that disappointed me."
1,Worst language calendar I've ever seen,"I am german, and bought this calendar for a foreign friend of mine in order to support him learning german. Compared to all the other language calendars I know, this is the worst I've ever seen. Every sheet just contains a plain german sentence simply translated into german. No further explanations, no background information. Moreover, I've found even an error in one of the translations. The contens does not seem to be very helpful in learning some useful german phrases for the beginner (except your aim is solely to know some sentences that might help you picking up german 'Fraeuleins')."
4,Juliet Cariaga + Samantha Stewart = Hubba Hubba,"I have to agree with the previous poster and say Alexa Lauren's solo scene is forgettable. Luckily, the always gorgeous Juliet Cariaga's and the underrated Samantha Stewart's scenes dominate this disc; one or both are in every scene except the solo scenes from Alexa and Jacqueline Phillips whose scene is also very nice. Explicitness is what you would expect from a Penthouse video although not quite as medically explicit as some of the newer videos like Pets in Paradise 1 & 2. Also, none of the very annoying ""MTV quick cut every 1.124 second"" camera work you'd see in a Playboy video; the director at least knows how to build some heat with slow moving and lingering shots. Overall, I'd rate this in the second tier behind the aforementioned Pets in Paradise 1 & 2, Gentlemen's Club, Dear Diary, and Pet of the Year 2000."
4,Hot babes on the beach!,"The name says it all .. and this video lives up to it! Nothing like a hot bikini brunette on the beach! Also, check out ASIN: B000F6YVRW for some more hot bikini action on the beach. The Beach Guru does not disappoint!"
3,Pretty good but not great,"Features Penthouse Pets Samantha Stewart, Jacqueline Marie Phillips, Alexa Lauren and Pet of the Year, Juliet Cariaga. Although maybe not quite as revealing as some playoff videos, this disc will not leave you yelling at the screen, ""Move your Hand!"", like most Playboy videos do. The plot is pretty basic, 4 girls sit around a campfire trading tales of the days aventures. The first scene is of Juliet and Samantha trying on swimsuits..., very erotic. The next scene features Alexa Lauren, whose fake blond hair and false breasts add nothing to the show. (Unfortunately an alarming trend by Penthouse to hire artifically augmented pornstars instead of natural college coeds) Jacqueline, Juliet and Samantha all have nice solo scenes. With Samantha's being the most revealing. The picture is crisp and clear, and the photography/scenery is first rate. If they'd have packed a macro lens and got rid of Alexa it would of gotten 4 stars easily."
3,"JULIET CARIAGA IS GORGEOUS ,I GIVE IT 3/5","This DVD is pretty good. It has nice scenery(ocean,beaches)and also has the models talking which is nice to hear for a change. The Penthouse models in this DVD are Juliet Cariaga which is an all natural brunette(perfect body,best looking natural breasts i've seen and these blue eyes that i can't get enough of,and awesome face,Samantha Stewart an natural blonde(great legs,nice smile)and great to look at,and Alexa Lauren which is nothing worth mentioning, she has that playboy look,fake chest and lacking attractiveness."
2,Basic rule for Penthouse series,It's better stick to Pet of the year series just as many others say.
1,Not bad for the price..,"Update: The cassette player doesn't work and it's too late to take it back to the store. Drat...so I can't recommend this boombox. I waited too long to test the cassette player out. The CD player and radio work fine. Cord is way too short too. Oh well, it'll just have to be a radio/Cd player for me."
5,"surgical clinics of north america,developments in Anaesthesia aug 1975 vol 55 no 4","new copy of old edition-original article of Aloon Winnie- regional neuronal blockade-supraclavicuar and interscalene nerve blocks-as an original, worth having rather than a faded photocoy ."
4,Beacon Street Girls,"As I recall this story is about two club memberswho are both running for class president. Someonetries to ruin the whole election. BSG Katani and Averyare in a race to win and almost become enemies. There areothers running too. Rivalry can cause problems, but in theend the girls learn a lesson. Enjoyable."
3,not bad,This book definetly shows how tight the Beacon Street Girls really are. Katani and Avery fighthing throughtout the book gave it some action. I feel Isabel definetly was stuck in the middle. I like the 3rd and 4h BSG better but i still liked this one.
2,There have been better!!!,"I really like the BSG series because these books are about girls my age with all the problems and concerns of a seventh grader. I really admire their friendships and how the girls try to be there for one another (usually). The girls don't require that everyone dress and act the same. They respect each other for who they are. The BSG also show that even though they are young, you can make a difference like when they raise money to save the local movie theatre in the fourth book! Promises, Promises isn't as good as the other books because it spends waayyyy too much time on the girls fighting about the election. I am not sure that I would have finished this book if it weren't for the fact that I had already gotten permission to read it for school. A little bit of fighting goes a long way!! However, I would encourage girls to read the first four books, I was sad when those ended and couldn't wait to read the next book!"
3,missing what I needed,"I bought this book mostly based on all the five star reviews that were given it. However, upon receiving my copy, I was actually disappointed thatit was lacking the information I was most hoping for. For some strange reason, this book doesn't discuss propagation of grapevines. Hmmm. I find this just a bit odd. Grapevines are a relatively common woody plant. I would expect at least some mention of them. But for some reason, I did find info on propagating more obscure woody plants. And the other info that it did have on grafting, I already had in other books. So needless, to say, this book was just a bit unnecessary for me. And the book also came across a bit more academic than I'd have hoped for."
4,Excellent reference,"The book is and excellent resource for the hobbist as well as the seasoned professional. I found a very good overview of many woody species, indicating the timing and method for propagation. The part of the text that fell a little short for me was the tissue culture section. This section could have been more detailed. I highly recommend the text."
4,Durr s Manual on Woody Propagation,I was pleased with the Woody Propagation Manual. Was received when expected. Full of information. The only draw back that it seemed to have ragged edges from cutting from the printing company .
5,A Touching Story,"This is a touching story that will bring tears to many eyes, particularly to those who are farmers. It's a story of death, loss, and remembering."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This system worked fine until the 90 day warranty ran out. Then you can pretty much guarantee that movies will freeze up and lock up entirely. The only way to fix the problem is to turn off the power, turn the power back on, eject the disk and put it in a different DVD player.I called Philips to have this unit replaced, and it would cost me an additional $39.99. That's about half of what I paid for it in the first place. (I had called about it previously and they were going to replace it free of charge, but I never received the information they said they were going to send me, and when I called the second time, they had no record that I had called the first time.) I wished I had bought another Panasonic player instead of Philips. I've had zero problems with Panasonic. No more Philips products for me:)"
5,plays everything,"multiregion(somebody else explain it before me),CD , CD-r, CDRW, VCD, SVCD, DVD, DVDr, DVD+RW, JPEG, MP3, MP3 and JPEG at the same time.You can't play DVD-R/RW(I really do not care) and do not support WMA files (you won't need it since you can use MP3 ) . Sound perfect, image perfect. Buy it, it worths more than the 90 bucks."
3,"great for the price, but a few features are lacking","After a month of research, I settled on Philips DVD-727. It's a good player, but it does have its drawbacks...(...).VIDEO: You will be surprised be the video quality of this unit, esp. when set to progressive scan.AUDIO: Not bad, but could be improved... CD playback sounds a little hollow. MP3 playback is pretty bad, plus it only shows you the first 10 or so characters of the file name. :(INTERFACE: there's only a play, pause and stop button on the unit. If you want to listen to CDs on this thing, you have to use the remote to change tracks. :( the remote is cluttered, and there's not many touch cues to help you locate buttons.FEATURES: very customizable and hackable. very quick machine too. the ""3D sound"" features are pretty poor though. :/VERDICT: best DVD/CD/MP3 player (...)"
1,"Region free capable, but poor quality","The region hack posted in other reviews DOES work, and the PAL to NTSC conversion works great, but on the 29th day I owned it, I started noticing artifacts on the picture (i.e. distortions) when I used the player.If you buy this product, take note that several of the reviews posted mention serious quality flaws and poor customer service from Philips. Thank goodness I can still return this thing."
1,Purchase with caution!,"Ok, here is the deal. I purchased this player and the 1st one came with NO power to the unit. the replacement has incredibly poor picture quality especially within the black. Read thru all of these reviews and notice how many review specifically mention poor quality. Think twice before purchasing this unit!"
2,poor quility,"I bought this one form amazon.com, for some reason most of DVDs I played showed very poor picture quility though a couple are fine. I have to return it to Amazon."
1,One Star For the Reviewers,"Why is the Review on May 30, 2004 exactly the same as the review on May 8, 2004? ""Canned apology for the invenience."" How original. We've heard that one before. Look, Philips products are the best out there. Your ""inconvenience"" is nothing compared to the inconvenience of going through 3 or 4 junky ""Apex"" DVD players, spending $300-$400 and having nothing to show for it. The only problems I've noticed with this player are that it records in widescreen only with S-Video on my DVD recorder and that some DVD-R's recorded with ""DVD Backup"" play with skips. However, these same DVD-R's play fine on my model DVD726. Therefore, I have concluded that the DVD726 is the better player, but the DVD727 has a better remote control. Both can be set to play all regions in the same way."
3,"It is a good, pretty, reliable DVD player, just a little slow.",I've had the product for a long time and it still is working great. The only thing that consistently aggravates me is the time it takes to power the unit up (from sleep) and get the tray to open.
2,worked great... for 2 hours,"Got this player because it's supposed to be able to play many different format.. and it does. Played DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW without problem. Even played my MP3 DVD... 2 hours after I plugged this thing in, screen went blank and that was the end of it.Tray would not eject and I had to ship the player back with my MP3 DVD in it. Now I have to re-rip all of my CDs again! And since this player is discontinued, Amazon could not send me a replacement unit.All in all, it could've been a beautiful thing.."
1,Broken after four months,"I purchased this unit in February, 2004 and now now 4 months later, I get ""NO DISC READ"" when a disc is inserted. The warranty is limited to a 90-day free exchange - since mine has expired, there will be a $29.99 exchange fee should I decide to ship it back (at my cost). Is it fair to have to pay to exchange a supposedly good dvd player that breaks down after just 5 months? Philips' customer service comments were basically just a canned apology for the inconvenience."
4,Recover the lost video,"I bought this DVD player in January and died (video disappered) 6 months later. It's a known issue that vidoe will disapper if some random keys are entered through the remote control. Luckly, I can recover the video by resetting to factory default. Here's how to make that work.Here's the sequence to reset to the default-press Stop tiwce (to make sure it's not playing any disc)press System MenuPress ""Right Arrow"" key 3 tiemsPress ""Ok""Press ""Down Arrow"" key 4 timesPress ""Right Arrow"" key oncePress ""Ok""Good Luck -"
1,Picture went out after 29 days,"This was initially the best DVD player I've ever owned, supurbpicture and sound and it played absolutely ANYTHING you threw at it. Every region disc, DVD-+R/RW, MP3's/CD-R's you name it.It was playing fine until the 29th day when I attempted to fast forward to the next chapter, as I did the screen went blank. I spent three hours of my Thanksgiving evening trying to get the picture back - no such luck. The audio was no affected however. I don't know what happened, but it appeared as if the video portion just dissappeared and what good is a DVD player without a picture?I wrote to Amazon and they sent out a replacement within eleven hours, great customer service!Let's hope this one stands the test of time!"
1,defective item,"This item quickly stopped working. The quality is very suspect. Perhaps more frustrating was the inability to return the item via the Amazon return procedure. After almost a month, was able to contact Amazon by phone. The ""real person"" customer care rep was helpful. Finally ordered a Panasonic player at a brick and mortar store. That was very successful and the machine works well."
2,Same as other reviewers-it lasted just a few months,"It's a shame. It worked unbelievably great for about four months then, see ya! It now, as other reviewers have experienced, now reads ""no disc"" when one is inserted. Great machine, great price, but you get what you pay for I guess. Too bad."
5,Flexibility and Quality for a low price,"Philips really hit the ceiling with this model. This player has the looks, slim and silver, with component video outs, all the range of audio connections (including all the digital ones) with a nice remote and a low price.If this doesn't seem a lot, this dvd is 100% hackable to view ANY dvd on earth. It plays whatever you pop in it!!!The downside? no DVI connections (if you are looking for a dvd this price you probably can't afford dvi anyway...). But this dvd has a very good image quality and the sound is outstanding...yes it does play MP3's and shows pictures. And actually has a very nice digital converter for your music you probably won't lose a thing. If this is your price range, Just buy it! It has features and components that you will not find anywhere else!"
5,"excellent book, but some sellers ask too much","Color Theory (Watson-Guptill Artist's Library)I just received ""Color Theory"" by Jose Parramon and I am a little bit puzzled by the price of this 1989 edition, slim 112-page book, with a price $16.95 on the back cover. The book itself is very interesting and useful. No doubt, just reading first few chapters, this is an excellent guide to any beginner in oil painting or a person interested in color theory and I highly recommended it. What puzzles me though are the prices for which this book sells from private sellers on Amazon. The prices range from $30-$130. This book is definitely good enough for $20-$30. I understand this is an out-of-print 1989 edition, but not sure whether I would buy this book for over $40. Also some sellers claim that the book is new. I would like to know how they preserved this book for twenty years to claim it to be new."
5,Very informative,This will teach you things about color you haven't learned anywhere else. I found it very interesting. Excellent reference guide.
3,The book is dated so why is it sold as new (The book may have been mummified at these prices).,The book is worth buying when your a serious artist. the asking pricess however on amazon from these seller are over the top.The book is worth at least $20.00.Beats me!!!
4,It Does The Job,"Hello,I purchased a new laptop (desktop replacement) that is notorious for running hot. I along with others feel the need to add additional fans to the existing laptop fans. The two fans on the Antec USB power notebook cooler provide peace of mind and does provide the additional cooling needed. I am confident that this is the best product on the market to do the job. My only criticism of the cooler is the fan noise is a little bit more noticeable than I expected. But I suppose if I didn't hear them they probably would not be doing their job. I would recommend this product.Take care,Bill"
4,Bewildered!!,"This unit does not fit the DELL inspiron 9300 17in lap top. I have not returned it because it does the job and I will form a custom frame around it to elevate my cpu. This Dell series has pads that are spaced in such a way that they will not align with the proper places on the cooler. Works great! Work on it all day and no shut downs operating on 110, which occured when I have this unit smoking!!"
2,Flimsy Cable,"The Antec cooler itself is very well made and did an adequate job of cooling my Centrino. BUT, the USB cable is very shabby and very short; and when I disconnected the USB cable from notebook, the cable fell apart. I paid $40 for this product and expected way more considering Antec makes very good PC cases."
5,This is a cool cooler.,"I purchased this notebook cooler for my new, hot MacBook 13"". The rubber feet on the MacBook are not thick enough to offer adequate airflow between the cooler and underside of the MacBook, so I purchased some 1/8"" peal-off/stick-on silicone feet from Home Depot and attached them to the top surface of the Antec. Voila, enough airspace for great fan generated cooling air to circulate. I've notice a big difference in how warm the left side keyboard area gets with the use of the Antec. Cool product. Light and easily fits in my briefcase along with my MacBook"
4,Better than Targus,This cooler is better constructed and operates more reliably than the Targus that I had previously. The only drawback is that it is a littler larger.
1,Not suitable for the new Macbook Pro's,"I bought the cooler after reading some reviews on the site, but when it arrived I discovered that it is not built for the 15.4 inch Macbook Pro, the cooler is not wide enough, and so the laptop sits on the fan itself, without any space between the fan and the cooler. More surprisingly, you can only plug the fan on one side of the laptop, since if you try to plug it on the left side near the power connector, it will not allow you to plug in your power cord! After seeing these two I simply put it back in the box and sent it back!"
5,Simple and excellent,"What you need from a VCR is this modern age is simple: stereo, excellent picture quality, s-video output and an easy to use interface. It also appears to have MACROVISION handling for backing up forgotten video favorites that are no longer sold in stores or available in DVD format. Anything more extensive in a VCR (like PAL or SECAM features) involves a bunch of other issues to be considered and might clutter its simplicity. For what it is, it is a terrific (and reasonably priced) piece of equipment."
1,A waste of time,"Had high hopes for this JVC VCR, since I already own a JVC TV. This item is an early version of what VCR's became. With 2-button recording and practically impossible to program I quickly returned it for a refund."
3,An okay purchase,Needed additional duster heads and not the pole so thought this would suit. Turns out it was packed tightly so that the tops of the three that I purchased were sent in one tightly packed package so the tops were smushed. The whole point of new heads is to have the tops round fluffy. A minor disappointment.
5,Works,Simple is better work easy and reaches where no other product would. Cleaned webs off 20 foot high window frames
5,Exciting look at some of the best Psychics!,"This is an outstanding and interesting collection of psychic information and how it exists. The look at several of the best Psychic's alive today is a real eye opener. Wish this had been out a few years ago, it is truly amazing. This book would make a unique gift for anyone with an interest in psychic information or on a spiritual path."
4,Firewind,Burning Earth is an awesome power metal CD! I bought the CD for the track The Fire and The Fury. Very sweet!
5,Amazing,"This poster is just as cool as it looks online. Just like one of the other reviewers stated it's an actual poster not a print so the quality is amazing. Even though Inara is furthest back, and therefore should be the blurriest, you can still make out her face very well. The detail is great. PosterRevolution shipped the package immediately and it came 2 days prior to the estimated delivery (that could just USPS being fast...although I doubt it because USPS is usually terrible). If you are contemplating buying this poster and you are a fan of Firefly or Serenity stops contemplating and buy the poster. I'm so glad that I did."
3,a let down ...,"The ending, if one would call it that, was a disappointment. I had a similar reaction to In Conquest Born, but it's amplified to the Nth degree in The Wilding. The story wasn't very fluid, until half-way through, when I finally caught wind of the coolness I had found in In Conquest Born. And then it went downhill again. It could have been so much more.I give it 3 stars because of the attempt to resurrect the eternally warring empires we were introduced to In Conquest Born. I wouldn't, however, truly recommend The Wilding to anyone."
4,"Wonderful worldbuilding, puts a whole new spin on things","A lot of people who loved In Conquest Born seem to have hated this book. I was at the other extreme -- I thought ICB was the weakest of her books. And the problems I had with it were basically worldbuilding problems. I couldn't believe that the societies she'd described were viable in the long term. This book fixes that problem. She explains both how the societies reached the points they were at in ICB, and how they have changed since then. I agree with other reviewers that the characters weren't all they could be, but I think that's because the main characters in this story were really the civilizations. If she'd been starting with an entirely new world, she probably would have been able to pull a 5-star rating, but hampered by the limitations of the worlds she'd already created, she still did a very good job."
2,Disappointing,"If you've read ""In Conquest Born"", then this is a bit of a let down.Cindy Friedman can, and usually does, write much better than this. It's not awful, just not up to her usual standards."
2,Good Music,"The ""Fiery Trial"" brings an exquisite soundtrack that will delight civil war music lovers. From an historical point of view, a good but very short summary of the war.It lacks of detail and prints or photographs from the era. When it treats the battles it only shows the actual battlefield from the State Park. It is a 30 minutes overview that will not add you interesting information."
1,Another bogus book by Hare...,"I read ""interior america."" It bored me to tears. I found the cover so pathetic/mean-spirited--a super-imposed image of a real-life photo that ran in a CA newspaper showing a man jumping froma structure to his suicide! Why would this alleged-champion of the work-abused, irrational writer, self-proclaimed photographer be so desparate to sell this alleged somewhat autobiographical-picture book with a cover of suicide? If I were that dying man's family--I'd have filed a lawsuit for sure. Definitely NOT worth the current asking price of nearly a 100 bucks!! LOSER of a book and photographer! Think of those poor trees that had to donate their lives to be yet other victims of Hare's ""books."" This book...well I just refuse to waste more time discussing it."
2,Short lifespan,"I used this device daily for a couple winters to dry ski boots. It worked fine for drying the boots as long as one took the boots apart occasionally to make certain the spaces between the boot liner and boot shell got dried out too. But after a year's use (two winters), the fan quits running and the heater overheats it so it cannot be set to run and left unattended. The manufacturer is unwilling to supply replacement switches or fan motors. For the price, this thing should last longer."
4,This thing will dry your river booties and other gear quickly.,"SO I hate putting on cold, wet booties when kayaking. I took this thing car camping and it was the envy of the other boaters. The timer is great, too. I also set it up in my garage to dry gear when I hang it up - I can direct the hoses toward the gear I want dried. Not too loud, either. THe only downside is it is rather large for car camping even."
4,drys our boots,We like this unit with the pre-set dry times and it does a great job.Negative: just the size - to large to take in a suitcase....
3,An odd pairing.,"The 1960 release of ""Come On Children, Let's Sing"" would be a 5-star rating by itself, since it is a Gospel recording true to Ms. Jackson's tradition. Songs like ""One Step"", ""The Christian's Testimony"" and Tom Dorsey's ""If We Ever Needed The Lord Before"" are landmarks of the Christian Faith. The style of Mahalia's singing here is consistant with her earlier recordings for Apollo Records and she is backed by her regular pianist Mildred Falls along with Willie Webb (Roberta Martin Singers) on organ and a righteous rhythm section of James Rainey (guitar), Aaron Bell (bass) and Osie Johnson (drums). But here's where the fun ends. ""Songs of Love And Faith"" is a typical left curve Columbia Records was famous for throwing. Although Mahalia tackles the god-awful material like a pro (eg. Dinah Washington, Billie Holliday), it is clear she is not comfortable with it. Why Collectibles didn't pair up ""Great Gettin' Up Mornin'"" or ""Make A Joyful Noise"" with the first album, is beyond belief."
4,nice integrated receiver,"It is too early to make detailed comments but seems to be working fine. It seems hot to touch after a while (but aren't all receivers like this)? Their mp3 supports 32 chars but no ID3 tag display. picture quality looks good on my analog TV. I like the fact that they give both optical and coaxial digital inputs for your game console, satellite etc (most integrated units have none or just the optical input). The sound quality is good through my Athena speakers, but I could attribute it to the quality of speakers. The speaker holes are too small for the 16 gauge cable I bought. I somehaow managed to cram it in. It provides 5 channel stereo for your music collection, (I guess an upgrade from their previous integrated model). Plays home made DVDs effortlessly. nice package for only $270."
4,Great so far.,"I have had it for more than 6mths, so far no problems. It plays everything i throw at it...dvds, cds, cdr, vcd, svcd, dvdr+-..only thing it has problems with is dvd-rw(rewritables). Other than that it plays all, including all my dvd backups. I've never found heat to be a problem on this unit even after extended play. The tons of connection choices is a plus and has almost all the stuff in it...except some of the more obscure Dolby capabilities and thx. Another reason i got this unit was because it had a competent dvd player built in. I did not want to get another player and take up more space on my shelf. The receiver functions, though not extremely high end, does have most of what you need to build a decent and competent home theater. Some things I consider important that this has is DTS, DOLBY, and progressive scan. Pictures look great on my plasma with component outputs.I got it for $159 so it was a good buy for me."
5,JVC and Orb Speakers,"Just to add to Hershon2004's review, with the Orb speakers, this is the best-sounding system I've ever owned. I have the Classic One Stereo Speakers (two satellite speakers and a subwoofer). Probably the best system under $1000."
1,not happy,"I bought it because the man at Petco said that it had a lifetime warrenty. It stopped working after 7 mos & Petco won't give me a new one. I need to go thru the manufacture. My fish can't wait a week or 2+ for a new heater, so I need to buy one today. I will not be buying this one nor will I buy from Petco."
4,Just get the Flower Hood,Just purchase the Sony LSF-VHA Flower Hood. This will give you the ability to put filters and to use the hood. For only $10 more it seems like a no brainer to get the hood with adapater built in.
5,Dries up the problem ones,This mask works really well for bringing the junk up to the surface. It also works really well for drying up the blemishes.
4,"Great, But Not Sequential","Be careful. Fleming is a great read - truly the foundation of the movies. But in Fleming's books ""From Russia with Love"" is the end of a triligy (each a great story) starting with ""On His Majesty's Secret Service"" then ""You Only Live Twice."" Enjoy them all!"
5,Baby and Parent Nursery,"I borrowed this DVD from the library, watched it several times and am trying to buy it. It was made in 2003 it would be nice if they would update it. Amazon doesn't have this DVD in stock. The buying section of Brightening Minds web site is down, but they referred to 'Baby and Parent Nursery' which are two DVD's by the same people. The reviews of them look promising, but I like to preview kids shows before buying them."
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!,"I bought a Karanga ipod case about a month ago. It looks good in the picture on their website, but when the product arrived it was scratched and dusty and very cheeply made. They don't have any kind of phone number to call either on their website or in the yellow pages (as a matter of fact, the address they give on their website is actually for an auto repair shop in New York). I tried emailing them asking how to return the case and I still haven't heard anything from them (it's been about 2 weeks).Please don't buy anyting from Karanga. They sent me a crappy product that I am now stuck with...they seem to disappear as soon as they get your money."
3,Could be better...,"These shoes were EXACTLY what I was looking for when I saw the picture. However, when I received them, I had to return them for a half size bigger because they run small. When I received the larger pair, I wore them to work, and they hurt my feet after a prolonged period of time because of their weird shape. They are also much taller than they look in the picture, which is great for a night out, but not so great for work. I probably wouldn't buy them again, nor would I recommend them to anyone else. I saw a similar pair at Macy's, and they were a little lower and much more comfortable, but they were much more expensive as well. I wish I would have just spent the extra money, but these will do for now."
3,WRONG WRONG WRONG,"The part played by Jane Russell should have been played by Marilyn Monroe, not Jane. Placing Jane in this role totally ruined the movie in that her fans love, and expect to see, her usual strong lead and those wonderful smart-ass quips. Seems like someone was trying to make her into Marilyn, and that just isn't Jane! However, if you can get passed that huge error ... the film can be fun, I guess. However ... being a Jane Russell fan ... I still disliked this movie ... it slightly marred my respect for Jane's professionalism! As for Jeanne Crain, her role fit her like a well tailored suit."
2,The Big Act 2 duet is missing,"Good sound, interesting cast; Reinmar's excellent, Arndt-Ober very fine, Ranczak also good. Roswaenge is one of the most important tenors of the period, with many admirers and not a few detractors. Recordings of his are not uncommon. But this set is missing the big tenor-soprano duet that, for most admirers of the work, is the very core of the piece. It would be nice to have had this pointed out before purchasing it. I would look elsewhere for recordings of these singers."
5,Flusser & media philosophy,"Vilem Flusser proposes a fascinating philosophical contribution considering the impact on the photograph, photographer, and their impact on contemporary society. His perspective is truly groundbreaking. Well worth the purchase and highly recommended for those interested in the social flow of perspective relative to content in concert with its distribution."
2,Not my bag,"This is another of those books that either goes over my head or somewhere else off target. While not especially verbose, for this sort of material, I just can't get excited about detailed discussion of stuff that does not really seem relevant to either making or appreciating photography, or any other art form, for that matter. Not of practical use to photographers."
5,dieteticly compliant,"Not only is this cookbook ""diabetically"" correct, it's also entertaining, with stories, tips and tidbits from Patti interspersed throughout the book. I love it!!!!"
2,Cookbook,"I was very dissappointed that the book itself was of very poor quality. Maybe the recepies are good but the way they were presented in the book, they did not invite the reader to try them out. The photos were all about Patti Labelle and her friends, not about the recepies or cooking. A cookbook should contain colorful inviting photos of the various dishes."
3,slightly dissappointed : (,"The book had some great recipe ideas but I was slightly dissappointed because I was hoping to find healthy, delicious, diabetic concious ways of cooking the old fashioned soul food favorites like mac & chz, collard greens, candied yams, etc...other than the oven fried chicken, those recipes were no where to be found in this book! I saw the healthy soul food books but I wanted a name I could trust! I heard Patti could cook! So I was really looking forward to that, guess I'll have to keep searching! Overall, it's a great cook book! Just wasn't exactly what I was looking for."
5,Absolutely Delicious,I bought this book for a diabetic friend. I could not believe how delicious the meals were. Amazing. You do not have to sacrifice taste at all for health in this book.
2,Disappointing,"I wasn't expecting a video from the 80's. I guess I should have read the synopsis more thoroughly. Not a horrible workout to follow along with, but beefcake factor that ""makes it interesting"" was almost depressing."
2,Da Vinci 3 aerobic workout,"Somewhat disappointing, black & white, a great deal of repetition of the aerobic dance movements, six guys using a lot of energy but having no physical contact whatsoever and no introductory scene in the changing room which might have stimulated one's interest."
2,Misleading,The description for this product was misleading. Typically a read along CD comes with the book and this does not clearly state that it is only a CD. Would not have purchased just a CD for the price.
3,It's ok.,I bought this book for my 3 yr old daughter. My first language is Spanish and I have been teaching her since she was born. My husband doesn't speak Spanish so her first language is English. I am disappointed in this book. My daughter does like it but I needed a book with more text. It doesn't have many words in it. You pretty much have to make up the story yourself. Anyone could have written it. The drawings are nice. This book is for a much younger child.
3,Good but Very Simple,"The book is cute but the vocabulary in Spanish is limited. If you are in a Spanish-speaking household these will be the words you will learn from birth (like tio, mama, abuelo). I prefer other books in this series that have a wider vocabulary. It may be good for a non-bilingual household."
1,Ahh Geese let's see about this album!,"Get it,Buy it and own it before they do.Alsoyou won't mind if I said this,Right?Um..I don't think you guys should buy this album becauseit's not really good.I think it would be very weird if youdid anyway.I don't wanna buy this album because it's really comparing the songs from disneymania1,2&3.That's why I give itone star."
1,"What is the truth, April 3, 2005","I had a hard time defining which facts andconversations where true and what was assumption. After reading this book onewill question the honesty and integrity of the author. There are far too manycontradictions for a reader to comprehend just who is dysfunctional and whoisn't. I hope the concern is unwarranted, but the contradictions are on goingthroughout the book. But I do wish the author and her family the best."
1,This is the worst book ever,"This book is the worst book I have ever read in my life, Candy had not filled all the pages there are a bunch of blank pages in this book and the spaceing is way to far apart. I also don't agree that this book will make a good movie, I know that if it was made into a movie then I would never go to see it."
5,Great look at the old and new alike.,"This book is a must for any true fan/student of hip hop history. Kool Moe Dee is by far one of the original great MCs and he breaks it down. The point system is excellent. Although I might disagree with some of his scores, KMD does a great job of explaining how and why each artist scored what they did. Whether you agree or disagree with his list, it is a great insight into hip hop history from one of the MCs that helped create it."
4,a really good Book,"I never get tired of List Books when it comes to Music.because you can debate any&everything&still be right.when it comes to MC's debates can go on&on&this Book will stir many a debate but is very well written&covers the basics for where Cats rank&why.very detailed,interesting&Brings so elements that can have you looking&listening to an Artist diferently because of Presentation alone."
3,Pretty Decent Book,"I have been listening 2 hip for over 20 years now, When I think of KMD, I think battle rapper. A rapper who i thought beat LL in there battle between each other. When it comes 2 music he has some hits under his belt. Now 4 him 2 rank himself top 5 was going a little overboard. This dude does not any classic albums. But then again its his book and his opinion. But I look at this list and see Will Smith,Fat Joe,Lil Kim,Mack 10,Foxy Brown. Where is Masta Ace,Chubb Rock,Biz Markie,Special ED,Big L. As I said its his book. But overall decent book."
3,Good book,"The book overall was rather well done. I liked the rating system and all the different asepects that were measured for each artist. However, there were many inaccuracies in the details. At times it seemed as if Kool Moe Dee had not even heard the artists freestyle or battle and yet he made guesses and gave them good ratings. It was also a shock that Big L was not even mentioned and that itself lowered my opinion of the book."
3,not quite,even though i respect moe dee because of his skills and he was one of the greats when i was coming up i disagreed with alot of his choices and his order. thats not a problem because i'm sure he wrote it to spark debate and to get a dialogue going about the art of the mc. some of the writing becomes monotonous and i find him saying alot of the same things about mcs. even for this list being old(2003) i didnt think he captured some of the great mc's of the time. craig mack top 50? not at any point of his life Moe. SHOOK MY HEAD AT THAT ONE!!! its a good read and like i said a better dialogue starter.
3,"Good Book, But.....","Good Book but I disagree with some of the rankings and some of the people who made the list and some who did not.KMD did a good job on breaking down the way the emcees were effective, but I disagree with somethings in this book.For instance how can Foxxy Brown & Lil Kim be on the list, when Andre 3000 & Eminem are not. How is Will Smith rated above Busta.I do like how he did pay respect to the old school, many rappers who are not well known but who truly belong on this list.The main thing I disagree with is Rakim's ranking. Rakim should have been number 1. Rakim is your favorite rapper's, favorite rapper. True there are other rappers who may have things that Rakim does not have, but his all around skill is so great that he more than makes up for it.But all around this book should be on the shelf of every true hip hop head, who knows and understands the history behind the music."
4,Khong Guam Marie cookies,This cookies have a very good taste and they and go very well with coffee or tea.And I'm pleased with the Khong Guam firm. They are very reliable.
4,Great Case,Case is great and very flexible. Protects my Macbook 13 with no problem. Lots of other slot to fit other things as well
3,good bag overall,"great bag for protecting and carrying my macbook, but after seeing some other bags in person @ the apple store, i kinda wish i got a backpack instead with more room and faux fur feel .incase,oakley and wenger make good bags ! i'ts got good pockets and sufficient room, but gets a little tight when i put my macbook in with its mcally shell on.i give it 3 stars."
3,scary stuff,Older book but still a good read. The fact a nurse could hurt children for her own weird highs is pretty frightening. The book was well researched and for the most part flowed with only a few slow parts about hospital administration etc.
3,hospital politics,"I found the story fascinating. The nurse involved was not a mercy killer, or a sadist. She just liked the excitement of ""codes"" that revived dying children, so started giving kids injections to make the codes happen. This is a variation of ""Munchausen by proxy"" syndrome, that sometimes is the cause of children's hospitalizations, where usually the mom causes her child to be sick so that she can nurse her child and get attention. What I found even more fascinating was how hospital politics worked to deny they had a problem: as far as punishing the whistleblowing nurse and doctor in charge of the nursery. A sad but true story of how malpractice (and even murder) can be and sometimes is covered up in our modern hospitals."
5,Great Read,I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. It continues to be one of the best true crime books I've read.
1,"A DULL READ, SKIP IT","Just what the world needs, another true-crime evil nurse book. Ploddingly written, and just uninterestingly rendered. Author should be writing VCR manuals. Skip this boring thing."
3,"Don't Buy It ""Right Now,"" Maybe Later","""Right Now: Live at the Jazz Workshop"" is a typically good live performance from Charles Mingus, there's just nothing overly exciting about it. The two extended compositions ""Fables of Faubus"" and ""Meditations"" are performed on numerous other recordings, and these are not the definitive, must-have versions. Also, this recording is from 1964, and there are two other live recordings from the same year that I would easily recommend ahead of this one -- ""Town Hall Concert (OJC)"" and ""Revenge."" Both of these CDs feature all-star bands including Eric Dolphy, whereas ""Right Now"" is an average band, with Clifford Jordan and the ever-present Dannie Richmond the only notables. This isn't a bad Mingus album (he didn't make many of those), but there are much better choices available."
2,Hummingbird Window feeder,"I have many hummingbirds in my perennial gardens. This window feeder allows me to observe them up close and for longer periods of time. It sticks well to the window, HOWEVER, the removable ""flower"" will not stay in the well. It exposes the liquid and the birds won't drink from it without the flower effect. I have to constantly go outside and place the flower back onto the feeder from where it fell on the ground. The flower is also metal and gets extremely hot in the summer sun. The birds do use this feeder, though."
2,Distracting feature,"I purchased this dictionary because of its length (800 pp). But I find it too simplistic and it gives a phonetic pronunciation of every single entry, which seems unnecessary, and is very distracting. Words or phrases such as ""Faith, Rule of (ROOL uhv Fayth)"" and ""God, Attributes (A-trih-byoots uhv GAHD)"". They need to limit this feature to unusual, uncommon or Latin words and phrases.I recommend the Catholic dictionary by John Hardon."
3,Melodic Rhythms for Guitar,"This is a useful and challenging book, extremely helpful as a structure for mastering the discipline of playing tight rhythm in a multi-guitar group. To some extent the principles are simple common sense that could be worked out without any book, but Leavitt's exercises provide a ready-planned progressive development path that helps a student to get the balance between perfecting what they can already do and pushing on to try new things.The print quality of this book is adequate but not great - the paper is coarse and the ink is smudged in some places, especially stave lines and 'full-body' notes (crotchets and quavers). In other places (particularly titles and explanatory text) the ink is under-applied, leaving the text faint and therefore harder to read."
3,Might work for some,"It does have a lot of rhythmic practice, but I couldn't bring myself to ""use"" it. Not engaging enough - I found myself often just sightreading/practicing to real music, and I've gotten to a point where I'm not sure it's worth going back to this.As others have said, this isn't professionally typeset, just (neatly) written manuscript that is perfectly legible."
2,you can do much better for a little more money,"OK. I already owned a Sony dvd recorder. But I needed another unit for the bedroom so decided to try the Philips. Took it back after two days and got another Sony.Problems:- doesn't read and write many formats- the menus use strange hieroglyphic symbols - I for one prefermenus in plain English- you use the remote for certain things, then have to go up to the unit to read the display for other things- interesting bugs - for example, half the time, if I wanted to record a two hour show it worked fine. The other half of the time, it would turn off after recording after only 10 seconds. Tech Support said this MIGHT be fixed in their current software upgrade... they'll send it and I should have it in about 10 days.- the manual was really poor. It was at least in English, but was very vague.Nope. I dont think so. For just a little more money, you can have a MUCH better unit."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"We purchased this product new for $500.00. It never worked correctly. The video to DVD transfer was never true from the originals. It would make it too bright. It's also extremely sensitive, so if your video is snowy, it may not record it or skip parts. It crashed while watching DVDs. Every time I tried to contact them, they would have me speak to someone in India and I would only get software upgrades. This product has also been discontinued. Philips products are terrible and their customer service is even worse. I also had color issues with one of their TVs. I wasted much of my money and time. I hope you won't do the same."
1,its junk,"I have had 2 of these, first lasted 2 weeks, its replacement lasted 3 months. When they work, they do a good job, except many disc errors. I would hope for so much money, it would last a bit longer Service department useless. It's junk, buy another brand."
2,How do I use this thing?,"Better yet... WHY do I use this thing? I haven't yet experienced the other problems people are having, but I find this device difficult to use. The remote is confusing. There is nothing intuitive about the way the remote buttons are labeled or positioned. Some of the menus are confusing. They consist of a bunch of ridiculous symbols that mean nothing to me. They couldn't have made it more complicated to use! The manual is no help. What were these designers thinking? I am a relatively intelligent adult, but I have to stop and think every time I pick up that remote. Which button do I use to do what I want to do? I don't have the energy. I have never had this problem with any other recording device in the past."
2,Firewire has problems,"I first bought the cheaper magnavox/philips mdv650r, but returned it to buy this one because of the firewire input. But trying to transfer old video from a Sony dig8 camcorder was disappointing. There were glitches every few minutes, like it was getting out of sync. The non-firewire video copies looked good, so I returned this to buy the cheaper mdv650r, which only lacked firewire."
1,Save your money.. Do not buy,"I have owned the Philips 75 for 16 months. It worked well for 1 month. It would give disk error on +R. Customer svc mailed new firmware which I installed. It worked ok but still give a no disk error about 10% of time. I used it for the next 15 months. Then it started freezing when recording after 4-6 seconds and cut off.It will not play the DVDR disks it has made. I am in process of getting upgrade software/firmware. If this does not work, its junk at 16months.Ron"
5,What's with all the Complaining?,"I purchased the Philips DVDR75 2 weeks ago and really have no complaints. I have already transfered 56 hours of VHS home video onto DVD+RW discs with zero problems. The recorder even pauses when there is no signal from the input source. Yes, some of the on-screen menu icons are a little cryptic but once you run through them a couple of times it's a piece of cake. (...) this is an excellent DVD recorder."
2,Just like everyone else.,"Well from reading the other reviews I can only add the same ole same ole. Purchased in Nov 2003 worked pretty well until 2 months ago.Seems like we are reaching the max use range on this product. Disk errors started cropping up, would not read the disk it just wrote too etc. etc. I just got word from the repair store today and the laser lens is shot and $350 to repair, needless to say what my decision was. Less than 3 years of use and now I have a VERY expensive DVD player. (while that lasts but who knows for how long). Customer ""no service"" at Philips could seem to care less. They spend 10 minutes getting your personal information and 3 minutes on diagnosis. All in all I can't recommend the machine or the company. I may make the same mistake on a different manufacturer or model but I won't make it again on a Philips product."
1,STOP! DON'T THROW YOUR MONEY OUT THE WINDOW!,"I have owned this model for one year. I have had problems from very early on, except past the allowable return time from Best Buy and have contacted Philips customer service countless times, each time they gave me a different possible solution. I could write a whole seperate negative review on their customer service and how hard it is to get through, understand the rep. etc. The machine is worthless, all these features but they don't work. Most of the time it won't even PLAY a Disney DVD movie, let alone record a tv show. I have followed every suggestion, including using only up to 2x speed dvd media, only +R, professional cleaning, setting the unit level, installing software updates...nothing works. This was supposed to be the high end unit to buy at $600 and it is truly a piece of junk."
1,Philips Does not have a clue,Philips is by far the worst company out. Very bad customer service and they do not have the technolgy to make dvd recorders. It's your money but I gurantee that any Philps Dvd recorder will not last more then 2 years if your very lucky. I had two models 985 and 75 both falied after the warranty went out. I just bought a pioneer best company when it comes to Dvd recorders. pioneer came out with the technology and are by far the leader in dvd recorders. STAY AWAY FROM PHILIPS PLEASE.
5,Perfect for TiVo Flawless Performance,"I've had this unit for several months already. I bought it so I could record from my TiVo. So far, I have recorded over 25 DVD's and had no problems at all, NONE.The unit is fantastic, I haven't upgraded the firmware and even thought there is a bug with the software when ffwing (if you go more than 4x it will do it in increments of 3 minutes), it still is fantastic. I can live with the bug since I sometimes find it usefull.The only drawback I found in this unit is when you try to enter a title for your recording. It is a bit annoying to scroll over all the letters. They could have created a grid with all the letters and numbers instead, but hey, as long as it works well I have learned to live with it.I do not use the unit to record directly from the TV so I cannot give my oppinion there. Still I recommend it for anyone wanting to transfer their favorite shows from the DVR (TiVo) to a DVC"
3,It does what it is supposed to but it has flaws,"I checked to see if it does what it advertises and I found it does a good job. However, I found that an old movie I had on a DVD+RW did not play anymore in another DVD player after I played it on the DVDR 75.There is not as much lapse time when changing from one channel to another as in the previous Philips model 985. However, the remote control is not a universal one as the one that comes with the latter. This means I have to have another remote control for the TV volume.The worse flaw is that when it is on it gets very, very hot. It has a fan built in (a fairly noise one), but it is not enough. I don't think this is going to do much for the life of this model.Philips customer service, although very cordial and prompt, is useless because it is such a new model that they can't help you on anything especific to this unit."
3,Good,My wife and kids liked them more than I. I would have preferred a bit crisper/drier for being roasted. Flavor is good and they were fresh.
5,Satisfied,"Everything was as I had expected. Nice and new and I got it very fast also, which is always an advantage."
2,Deception,"On 5/16/2011 rookieangelbear (half.com by ebay) shipped me a book titled, ""Intervention Strategies for Sexual Abuse."" The book was written and published by Robert Rencken. As I had known the author, I wanted a new copy.The issue is that the company promoted the book as new and when I received it, it was not. The first page had the previous owners name scratched out in black magic marker. Pages 30,31,40,41,and 63 had black ink underlying. My definition of new is no makss or underlining on any page. The company included a note with $1 saying I hope that this is OK. I request that Amazon end this deception."
5,"If you didn't love Pandas before this book, you will now!","The photos in this book are absolutely amazing! Starting with Hua Mei's 1st teeny tiny black & white photo camera that had been installed inside the panda den, and the book ending 1 year later. I can't say enough about the photos!This is the 1st year in the life of Hua Mei and is pronounced Hwa May. In China, one name can mean different thing and Hua Mei's means Splended Beauty AND China-USA. The birth of Hua Mei in 1999 in the San Diego Zoo connects both China, the country where pandas roam and here in the Us where she lives.This is one of those books that grows with it's young reader! The author Joanne Ryder lots of information on each page. There is a big bold font that tells the story and then a smaller not so small font that gives additional information! I just can not say enought wonderful words about this book! A definate book to have in your home library!"
1,Wow! These are bad.,"My goodness. These headphones are bad! Got them FREE with some other speakers. They weren't worth the bother of shipping. They belong in the garbage. No bass at all. I'm not an expert at these type of headphones, but these deserve a zero. Horrible."
3,not quite.,"Berezovsky seems to skim through these etudes as if looking through some dossier.The teutonic fire whith which liszt endowed these etudes and which are manifested in jeno jandos version are nowhere to be heard in these recordings.Berezovksy plays with a stunted sort of interpretation,completely fettered by his lack of transcendentalism.Now,it is hard to deny the wondrous imagery of any recordings of these etudes for they are among the most sublime pieces of art.Therefore i recommend other versions(naxos) as they may exult and inspire listeners even higher than berezovsky manages to."
5,Pimp recording,"Berezovsky slaps these etudes down. He makes these pieces musical instead of what we hear of more popular pianists. If he can make these his b***ch, imagine what he can do with the Chopin etudes(which he also recorded)."
5,Best book on holy relationships!,"Understanding the ego dynamics that are behind special relationships is crucial to achieving a healed, holy relationship. Robert Perry, whose knowledge of the Course is superior, presents A Course in Miracles' principles in an easy-to-read style and with great examples. He then gives simple but effective exercises to unlearn the old habits and see our partners in a new light (see images I uploaded). I highly recommend this book and have given copies to all my friends! All of his books are great, such as ""Reality and Illusion,"" ""Return to the Heart of God"" and ""Path of Light."""
2,no minimum,First of all the phony fluid they replaced mercury with separates so badly that it took a day of following their directions on how to get it right and that didn't work so wife heated it. Now the metal slider that is supposed to track the minimum just sinks into the reservoir and doesn't work at all. The old models worked fine but not the new style.
3,great customer service...,"I was happy with this product after purchasing it, the customer service department is great..... they replaced it..."
5,A Must Read for Consertative Americans,Again the Judge clarifies the Constitution and the abusive way the Federal government and all it's agiencies twist and/or disregard it.
5,Constitutional Chaos: Good book and entertaining read.,Good book and worth a read. It's pretty obvious that the Judge has some Libertarian in him.
4,good book,"This was a very well written book.It is a history lesson of American Government.Certainly very eye-opening.The Judge should be a supreme court justice, his view of the law is what kind of judges we need more of on the supreme court.Keep preaching the truth Judge maybe we will wake up before its to late!!!"
1,The expert's disease,"Judge Napolitano regrettably suffers from ""the expert's disease"" -- his narrow, specialized point-of-view has blinded him to the legitimate concerns of the community at large. Like many people who have made a career in the law, he has become obsesses with the minutiae of ""rights"" and ""process."" He has lost touch with the deep concern of ordinary people that actual ~justice~ be the result of the legal process, not just a trial record that is without flaws from the perspective of a constitutional scholar. And many of the constitutional ""rights"" that he so zealously defends are recently minted by activist jurits, not put into the constitution by the framers. If you, like the judge, think that the country's big problem in criminal justice is carelessness with defendants' rights rather than the absurd legal obstacles that obstruct prosecutions, then you may enjoy this book. I didn't."
4,The Guy at Fox who knows what he's talking about!,"This is a great book, obviously a lot of work went into this. His examples of the government breaking its laws are excellent, however there are worse outrages out there. I wish he would have connected some dots with the growing police state and globalization. However, I feel I know more about the Judicial system, and have learned just how scary things are getting, but trust me...its even worse than what's in this book. Overall, worth the read. I am anxious for his next book. Anyone interested in government tyranny should check out Alex Jones ([...]) and his work."
5,MUST READ,"Judge Napolitano's book about how the government abuses its power is an absolute must read. You will never see the government in the same way again. Some of the things the government has done over the years are absolutely sickening, the Freedom movement is lucky to have Judge Napolitano in its corner."
2,Couldn't get through it,"I really wanted to read about how we can get our judges to protect our Constitution. Unfortunately, after three chapters, I had to stop reading this one. They were all the same! Basically illustrations of how bad the judges were - how they were using the bench to their own ends rather than meting out justice. And they all got away with it! Really depressing!"
3,It's ok...,"This book is confusing to say the least. They don't point out the obvious required formulas, you have to do a lot of hunting to find the information you need. I bought this book because the ebook version of this book was wretched. Having the physical book has helped my grade, but overall there are better calculus books colleges can use."
1,Not worth the time,"It was unfortunate that my university used this book for Pre-Cal all the way to differential equations. My main complaint is that the book speaks to seasoned professionals who are already engineers or had previous experience with higher mathematics. The book has these assumptions and it's frustrating to a student who is beginning a career in engineering, and takes the higher math for the first time. If you are a beginner, you will likely fail at the hands of this book without ample accommodation from tutors. The book tries to explain the concepts but not in a way that's easy to digest. The instructions and explanations are complicated. This book should NOT be used by beginners but it might make great reference for those who are in the engineering field."
1,don't buy books from first class books,They sent me the wrong book and after I emailed them about it their only solution was to return the book for a 50% refund. Terrible service. Find somewhere else to buy books.
1,Basic Technical Mathematics with Calculus SI Version (9th Edition),"THE WORST BOOK ONE CAN USE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW COME THEY PUBLISHED SOMETHING LIKE THIS. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE EXPLANATION USED IN A CLASS, AND TRUST ME EASILY TO GET LOST. IT MADE SO FRUSTRATED HOW BADLY IS IT DONE, AND STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY DO WE USE THIS ONE WHEN THERE ARE BETTER ONE. AGAIN, THE WORST BOOK ONE CAN USE, AND IF YOU CAN DON'T USE IT. TERRIBLE...IF YOU EVEN USE THE WEBSITE ASSIGNED TO IT, YOU ARE GOING TO REGRET SO...SIMPLY TERRIBLE AGAIN...."
3,Used for an online course,I was required to purchase this book for an online course. Really needed an instructor to ask questions about some of the more difficult problems in the back.
3,mediocre,"The problem with the book is that its not very organized and is not quite as detailed and you'd hope. when giving out exercises, it doesnt mention whether to solve it through radians or degrees which really irritates you when the solution does not match the answer then you realize it's right but has to be converted. it also only has solutions for odd numbers of the exercises given. it would have been nice to print out a few more pages for all of the final answers of the exercises (wouldn't be that hard since the author doesn't have to show the solution, just the final answers). as for explanations and topics covered, its fine though."
1,Odd Man Out Here,"I hate to be the lone dissenting opinion here, but I found this book (9th edition, and I also owned the 8th edition too) to be very difficult to understand. If you are a beginner in algebra then I suggest you look for something else. However, I can't speak for the calculus part of the book, because I haven't got that far yet. For algebra beginners, may I suggest... Mathematics for the Trades 7th Edition (or later) [Paperback] by Carman, Robert. I managed a 4.0 GPA with this book."
3,Exmples can be a little vague.,"I have used this book for the past two semesters and I would rate it as ""ok"". It can be confusing at times and it doesn't always elaborate on a point."
3,text book,it worked. good deal for the price. I don't know what else to write about this. It's okay is all I have to say.
3,Useful but not a foley fork,"This googles as a replacement for the foley fork which is not longer produced. While it is similar in size and shape, the manufacturers missed a critical detail: foley fork tines have a twist to them. This is essential for cutting butter into biscuit dough or pie dough.This is a useful implement but not as good as a foley fork. However, it is currently a lot cheaper than buying a foley fork on ebay."
1,"waste of money if you want a ""foley fork""",I bought this as a replacement for my bent up 1970s Foley Fork and it does not measure up at all - the tines are flat not angled so it lacks the special ability of the original to cut as well as mash. dont waste your money.
3,Fantastic Food Fork,"Received forks in a timely manner. I do not think this is ""excellent"" service because I EXPECT to receive ordered items in a timely manner... therefore, it's ""good"" service. The forks are not exactly what I wanted - that would have been Foley Food Forks with the tines canted at an angle to help with cutting in dough or mashing potatos. I did make the adjustments to the forks that I needed by twisting the tines to do the blending job correctly. So from that standpoint, the forks are OK as they can be adjusted to the correct angle."
1,Racist to the Core -- Bill O'Reilly and Rush Love It!!,"Hard to describe the fear, hatred, and racism embedded in this book. Closet racists such as the conservatives at National Review rave about this book, because it posits that ""the white man"" brought civilization to the black and brown and yellow ""hordes"" -- if that is your cup of tea, enjoy wallowing in the desperate primitive fear and envy that permeates this book."
3,Interesting issues but premise exaggerated,"This thought-provoking book presents a hysterical nightmare image of third world immigration. Suppose France did have to accept a million Indian immigrants? In spite of that massive number, would it really be TEOTWAKI for several hundred million Western Europeans, or even 45 million Frenchmen? I doubt it. I find the prose somewhat turgid and can't exactly tell where Raspail's sympathies lie, even though anti-immigration groups have taken up this book as a rallying point.On a positive note, the book is commendable for encouraging us to consider the consequences of grossly uneven distribution of wealth, and for reminding us of the twin demons of excessive population growth and excessive consumption."
5,"Raspail's nightmare is a GOAL for the ""Diversity"" mongers","This is a book that will get 4/5 stars or 1: total polarization. Raspail wrote it was a WARNING; for the P-C ""Diversity"" mongers, it's a GOAL! He exposes the inner ROT of the West, the vectors of that Spiritual AIDS called ""Multi-Culturalism."" One must remember that Raspail, like Gobineau before him, lived in these 3rd-world hell-holes. ""Welcome our brothers from the Ganges!"" cry the French P-C ""Mongrolians,"" as a tiny group of Defenders of the West prepare to make a stand like the Spartans at Thermopylae. If you DON'T think it a warning, take a tour of CA, AZ, or TX, where ""La Reconquista"" is running full steam, as the lemmings pour through the joke of a border."
4,A book too accurate to be acceptable.,"If you like to think of yourself as politically correct, this is not going to be your kind of book. It deals with the destruction of Western civilization and values when the Western countries fail to take action to stem a tide of immigration, and submit to their domination through a sense of unwarranted racial guilt. There are too many parallels to actual events to deny its plausability."
5,Camp of the Saints,A dense read written metaphorically. Jean Raspail was prescient when he wrote this book and I encourage all to take heed as to what is going on regarding today's immigration. The anecdotes after the story are excellent. (And you'll learn to hate the invention called the airplane.)
4,The scariest story ever!,All it takes is to have one person to provide the chairismatic ability to move the masses.The have nots vs; haves is 200 to one or more.
4,good book about a topic that is important even today,"Definitely makes you think in regards to immigration from Mexico to the US and the whole debate on building the wall, etc. to contain it.I also enjoy how stereotypes were used as it is stereotypes which are used daily when people make decisions or think about stuff. Also, at a time of emergency, stereotypes are ever present as they serve as propaganda to support a specific opinion.I recommend renting it rather than purchasing it."
1,short stories sewn together ...,"I just got done reading kamila's latest book and was extremely disappointed. Not only is the narrative lacking in the poise and flow her previous works displayed, it also has no common underlying theme.I kept waiting for something significant to happen all the way to the end of the book.One would only hope that a couple of pages got left out of the print edition.I really expected something more substantiative ..."
2,"Sounded good, but I couldn't finish it","This book sounded so intriguing from the back cover & the first 3 pages, & the author's writing style is great, but for the life of me I could not finish this book. The characters were likable enough, but as another reviewer said, I kept waiting for something to happen. It never did. It's too bad, because there are some nice observations & phrasings in the book, but the plot is seriously lacking."
3,Broken Verses by Kamilla Shamsie,"The book has substance, a good story,and very good language.Butthis book has a very big defect. The Author does not developthe surroundings of the main character. The story is told in veryconfined areas. It is either the office, or the small apartmentor the actress's house. The author even has her main characterdiscuss her problems at sahoor time. It seems that not for amoment could the reader take a breather. Not for a moment couldthe reader get away from the psychological problems of the maincharacter. I felt quite exhausted from reading this book andwas glad when I finished and could finally go for a walk and breath fresh air."
2,Unremarkable dross,"This book was a pleasant read but is most remarkable for the fact that it leaves absolutely no impact on your memory, the sign of a book that is little more than chewing gum. Pure wallpaper!"
4,"Good imagery, embarrassingly terrible and distracting musical score!","Good narration (though occasionally lapsing into a ""sarcastic"" tone), very good footage, accompanied by arguably the worst score ever to be written for a film! (Another reviewer called the music a ""distraction""...but it's much worse, forcing a viewer to constantly counter the dissonance between the sound and the imagery!)"
1,not good,"I purchased this to add to my clip art for a community newsletter. Most of the art is unusable, bad, and some in bad taste. Their categories defy logic and the ""search"" key never lights up so you spend hours searching thru 25,000 pictures to find one that you need. The only saving grace was my ability to copy the pictures into another software package I have that does allow for searches. All in all I probably found 25-30 pictures I could use."
4,good - but not perfect,"a very good novel, disguised a introduction into spaceship design .. or vice versa.however much i liked it, i have two points of critique:1. quite obviously a lot of thought went into the design of the launcher .. however we do not see a lot of these off-stage thoughts. an expanded appendix covering this would have been much appreciated2. why - oh why - was the decision made to use imperial measurements only? no metrical measurements (which are only used by about 97% of mankind) in sight - not even in parenthesis (as would be common in most technical literature ..point 2 was for me the reason to give only 4 stars instead of 5"
3,A good start to Listening,"This book offers some comprehensive insights for people with relationalship problems due to the lack of listening. It appears that the book is geared towards listening to people you know within your family or friends. Lastly, the last copyright of this book is in 1995 which made it hard to keep an interest in the examples presented."
3,school book,i bought this book for a class but never actually read a lot of it. It came in good time and was well packaged.
4,Hard Work but worth the effort,Listening is a learned ability just like reading.Some books are easy to read but lack any real contents.People are the same. Some people are easy to listen to butlack any real content. Learning to listen to difficultpeople is worth the effort.I am reading this book for the third time. I didn't getmuch from it the first time.
5,They are back BIG time !,"After some bad years they are back at the best. This is no 1 song record all tracks are really great and i cant highlight eny song chose they are all just so good !It is just something you cant describe with words , you have to hear it yourself !!!"
3,"I'm sorry, this isn't going to help anybody","I'm just writing this to laugh at the girl who thought this was a swing CD. Ready? Here I go!BAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA!hehe!*snort, choke*I just hope she realizes how much she brightened by evening. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.besides that, the CD's pretty cool. Not great, but good. And it's PUNK ROCK! NOT SWING!"
3,Lawyers at Large,"Her current series ""The Good Wife"" is an extrapolition (not a spin off) of this. I believe that Juilianna so enjoyed this lawyer role it gave birth to the new series. You should watch the Canterbury's Law first if you can. It is kind of going backwards in time once you have seen The Good Wife."
5,Easy to read and well organized!!,"I have many different books on this topic. All of these book lack organization and conciseness. The edition previous to this one was my favorite until I lend it to a colleague. Then I purchased this book. To my surprise, the book is well organized so much that I was able to read through most of the book in a couple of sittings. The appendices are well though out and appropriately placed. I recommend this book for any PT beginning a career in acute care and for PTs currently in acute care that need a reference book."
3,A Little Disappointed,"Dottie sings beautifully as always and the songs are good, but the sound on this CD is not high quality. I was disappointed in the sound which is a bit noisy."
3,Good Product Poor Instruction Manual,The product is reasonably good once you figure out how to install it based on the instructions provided in the Manual. The instructions for installing the Cadence sensor are extremely confusing. The picture is hand drawn and it is very difficult to see how the sensor is mounted. Polar did not take the trouble to have someone install the sensors based on the instrucitons and proof out the installation procedure. If you are trying to check out the installation on a stationary bicycle stand it takes a lot of turns of the crank to register cadence. This could have been mentioned in the installation manual. Polar's website has a fairly good tutorial on the use of the computer. It would have been nice to have a tutorial on the installation with clear pictures.I will have to think twice about buying another Polar product because of their lack of concern for the customer.
2,Didn't make the cut,Product fell short. Weak transmitter is speed sensor would not send signal 13 inches to handlebar. Good for 6-8 inches only (I held the cycle computer in my hand next to the speed sensor and spun the wheel). Would have been a really excellent product otherwise. Fortunately excellent seller resolved to my complete satisfaction (refund).
4,Big performance in a very small package,"Pros: This cycle computer does it all, speed, heart rate, and cadence. Easy to install. The 'Own Zone' heart rate limits are amazing. Stick to them and you'll feel great after your work out. Wireless sensors are terrific.Cons: Instructions are sketchy. Can't quite figure out the timers. The cadence sensor didn't work and had to return it. The replacement took nearly 3 weeks but it worked. Had a little trouble with the battery but got it going OK."
1,"You won't learn much from this overpriced, out of date book.","First, it does not teach you VHDL as you would expect. As others have commented, it never gets down to brass tacks an explains how the VHDL language works.Also, the software it describes is WAY WAY out of date. To the point of useless.While the author is knowledgeable in the subject, he needs to hire a ghost writer and actually try the book on real students. He would be in for a shock if it was a fair test.I feel sorry for you were forced to buy the book for a class.There are MUCH better books available, at a much better price.BTW I have found used copies for as little as 3 dollars. Search on the ISBN to find them."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is easily the worst technical book that I have ever read. To be fair I gave up after 55 pages and almost the same number of errors. Diagrams are missing pieces or labels, or are just incorrect. The examples are either too vague to make sense or are incomplete or wrong. After three chapters the author had rambled through such an abstract description of the VHDL that he explained nothing. Save your money and buy almost any other VHDL book."
5,Christmas Music Repertoire,"I found this CD to be a great addition to a collection of quality Christmas music to be enjoyed during the holiday season. The lovely clear voice of Kiri Te Kanawa with the great back up of the fine choral music from the choirs recorded at Coventry Cathedral was what I expected. I was a bit surprised at the heaviness of Michael George's voice which I thought was really a bass, not a baritone. Overall--great!"
2,Disappointing,"The problem that I have with this CD is that it appears to have been over-produced and over-arranged. Poor Rosie sounds as though she was singing from somewhere outside the room. She is absolutely smothered. Too bad, because this lady is a great performer and always delivers, but she just had too much competition this time."
1,Ignorance of Scottish History,"I was inclined to buy this book until my confidence in the quality of the author's research was undermined when I read a sample page of her introduction to the work. Writing of early fifteenth century Scotland and the probably mythical stories of the Scots cannibal Sawney Beane, she says, 'When King John I of England (and IV of Scotland) heard the tales,he sent soldiers to investigate.' King John I of England was an early 13th century king who lived many years before the date of the Sawney Beane stories. Furthermore he was an English Angevin king, prior to the union of the Scottish and English crowns; he therefore had no jurisdiction in Scotland. He was certainly not, as the author says, 'John IV' of Scotland; no such person ever existed. Scotland has had only one King John, that was John Balliol, who was an elected king from 1292-1296 - again this is well before the supposed lifetime of Sawney Beane."
4,Pretty good,"Haven't finished this book but I contains a lot of Info covering many era's, so it is small tidbits of a plethora of covered cases."
1,",","I ordered this used and the seller didn't have it in stock so they sent me 2 packets of flower seeds instead.I eventually got the book.If the story is good, I have no idea because the writing is so bad I couldn't make it very far. It's written as if the authors internal mantra was ""I AM A WRITER!"""
2,not good,At first I thought the sex was taking away from the story line... then I thought wait there is no story line.. so I started reading it for the sex (I am adaptable) but then I figure the sex is not that great either... NOT my kind of vampire story... maybe I am just to much of a romantic... and there is not romance in this story... but I give it two stars for effort.
2,Where's the sex and action???,"This book would fall into the same category as many movies I have seen. It COULD had been a great book if they just would have developed it more and gave more detail into the parts people want to read. For on thing, the author spends 2 pages, max, describing what is suppose to be an erotic ""kiss of death"" from the vampire yet spends half a chapter describing some theater in the book. Let's be real people! I bought this book to be scared, intrigued, and turned on. Not to get tips on home decor'."
3,Great til the end...,"I picked up this book in anticipation of a long plane trip. I was completely enthralled in the book, loved the characters, the plot, everything. Until I read the last two chapters. I had been rooting for ""Jack"" (the vampiristic protagonist) and Claude (the one who seemed like a perfect lifetime partner for Jack) throughout the whole book. Unfortunately, Jack's untimely demise hit me about like the book hit the far wall of the room only seconds later. I would still buy and read the next book, if indeed this turns out to be series, if nothing else, only to see what happens next.Bound in Blood is a wonderfully written book. Even the ending is well-written. It just didn't follow the story-line that I wanted it to follow. This is not the Author's fault by any means, but I feel that the ending may hinder one's enjoyment of the completion of the story. Just be forewarned..."
1,Bound in Blood : The Erotic Journey of a Vampire,"I wouldn't recommend it unfortunately, I view this book as a plain killing Vampire story not Erotic. And I would not buy another of this type. I love to read about Vampires I read romances or erotic, but this was the worst of any type I've read."
2,A character no one cares about....,"This is one vampire who really doesn't care about any of his victims. And there are plenty of them, over and over again someone is introduced, killed and forgotten. The main character, Jack, seems like he doesn't really care about anything but himself. The ending is like a relief just to know he's supposedly gone. I wouldn't recommend it unfortunately."
2,Problems wtih Genius,"I found this book rather interesting, and the only reason I didn't vomit all over the cover is the fact of the vampires. I believe Lord could have just put a smidge of remorse in the monster Jean-Luc. If he had, I believe this book would have been absolutely riveting. The eroticism of the book was completely eroded by Jean-Luc's viciousness, by killing all his lovers. This book, all in all, was a pathetic attempt at homoeroticism, but a superb attempt at a vampire novel."
3,not worth it,"This book was so highly rated that I decided to get it even though I had not read it. I was disappointed in the bouquet ideas. Not too much that was unusual or unique in spite of the large number of pictures. You would do better to look at bridal magazines. There are no instructions, or anything else, just pictures of bouquets. I was glad I didn't pay full price for it."
3,Voltron Fleet Of Doom is a must have dvd!,Voltron Fleet of Doom is a must have dvd! I like the story and animation in this Voltron movie! It combines both Lion and Vehicle Voltron together in one hour. I think this animated movie is great! My only problem with this dvd is the video quality. the fleet of doom movie is good and very watchable. the video quality for the special features is a different thing. the Lion Voltron and Vehicle Voltron intros are of poor quality. I do not understand why special features video quality is not that great. I have no complaints about the fleet of doom movie but I think they should fix the video quality for the special features. C+
1,One of the worst movies ever,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I'm a Voltron fan. Save yourself some pain and buy one of the tv show's box sets instead. There you will get a true Voltron experience."
4,WEP tricked us and this dvd gets a wide release!,WEP first released this DVD saying that it will ONLY be available through Volton.com shop. Making us think that it's an exclusive and that we should hurry up and buy it from them.I feel tricked. I overpaid for the set because I bought is directly from the Voltron store. I wish I waited until now.. SHAME on them!The movie is great though! if you are a fan of the Voltron series then this one is a keeper!
4,a cool deal,Well I just like to know is this from japan or is this from the cartoon wiht all the lions and not the cars?anyone have any idea since no picturewhy no picture whats up with that that throws me off?i know they did it when they were selling the cartoon lions sets but come on a picture please?
3,"nothign new, but good show","Greetings,I actually purchased this via mail order (yes before the internet!) from WEP about 10 years ago on VHS. My copy is still in great shape and I have watched it often. If no special features have been added to the DVD, then I wont bother purchasing since I already have it, but if some special bonus content has been added, some details would be appreciated. Buy this only if you dont already have it."
1,Designer 2 Pak,"The graphics are very,very amateurish. My children produce better graphics in school. This company should hire better artists, charge more for their C.D.s and gain a little pride in themselves. What a waste of our money!"
2,The Conspirators,"This book is a sensationalized report of the Iran-contra affairs. Its author seeks to shock the reader of the government's misconduct. There is very little historical, methodical, or academic virtue to this book. It's for sheer shock and awe, which can easily be taken from serious book like Theodor Draper's A Very Thin Line."
1,I blame Halliburton...,"Nothing more than paranoid conspiracy theorist ramblings. Poorly written, providing no verifiable supporting evidence. If this vast conspiracy reached so far and resulted in the ""accidental deaths"" of so many people who knew too much, then how exactly was Al Martin able to write and publish this book without ending up in a shallow grave next to Jimmy Hoffa?"
1,UGH! No stars!,"This DVD set is terrible! I love the British television series, mini-series and movies. I loved Upstairs/Downstairs (the old version), Downton Abbey and many of the other quality productions from England. In the Flambards, the acting is so over the top; the actors practically chewed the scenery. The characters are unlikeable. The music is terrible, and worse. Another reviewer called it ""haunting"" - Good Lord! Also, the quality of the video is bad because it is grainy and shaky at times. Amazon offers $1 for this DVD set to be sold back. They are being generous. I am unhappy that I was sucked into buying this. Don't buy it! It is a terrible waste of nearly $30. I wish I had not purchased it."
3,Flambards,"I was anxious to watch this because I love British movies. I am still on the first disc and already disappointed. I do plan to finish the entire series, but picture and sound are poor. I keep turning the volume up and down on my television. I have never had this problem before. It definitely hurts the enjoyment aspect of the story.Flambards - The Complete Series"
1,very disappointed,"We were very disappointed with this DVD. The background music was jarring and very annoying, the acting amateurish and overall we could not watch more than the lst episode. It is not worth persevering with is."
1,Flambards a Flop,What a waste of time and money. The plot was predictable; the characters one-dimensional; the music irritating and intrusive; the acting overblown; the attempt to capture the social ferment of the late Edwardian era superficial.
5,Don't Pass It Up!,"I bought this when it first came out on VHS and have watched it many times over. It is a charming story of an indomitable young woman. Her creepy uncle wants her to marry Mark so her money can be used to shore up the decaying Flambards, but she falls in love with William. Their romance blossoms amid British class struggles, the beginning of aviation, and the ravages of World War I."
1,No subtitles?,"Yes, years ago we loved this series, and we have been waiting for a new release, but how dare they re-release it without subtitles?"
1,not good atall,This was a reprodution sound very poor and picture grainy I would not but from this person or company again
3,Great story awful sound track.,"Great period drama terrible, awful, horrible, what were they thinking sound track. If you can get past the really bad music you will love the story."
4,Flambards Just as Charming as Remembered,"I watch this on PBS when it was first shown. I also read the books. It was just as I remembered with the intelligent William, the loyal Dick, the handsome but troubled Mark all in love with Christina who stands up for herself, but really cares about the ones around her. It is also a glimpse into a changing world with the characters deciding just where they belong."
4,Flambards,I enjoyed this BBC production of Flambards many years ago. I had had it on VHS but that was destroyed. I was grateful to find it released on DVD and have enjoyed it again and again in the short time I have had my DVD's. Excellent reproduction and DVD information.
2,David Fanshawe What Were You Thinking?!,"The sound track in The Flambards is an unrelenting Twilight-Zone-esque singing saw. How this was meant to invoke Edwardian country manor life I can't imagine. The grating, disturbing effect prevented me from watching - and listening - beyond part 2.As a BBC historical drama fan, I looked forward to this series after reading so many good reviews. Sadly I really cannot recommend it."
1,junk! zero stars!,"The video quality of this item is horrible! Similar to an old double recorded VCR tape from analog TV! Do not buy! This is my first 'junk buy. Most other DVD's have been decent - not this one! The cover's nice, seems like the disk was a phoney copy...pirated?! Perhaps. : ("
1,Junk!,I can say nothign good about this series; poorly acted; horrible script; camera work was juvenile; music was horrible and didn't match the action--just poorly done.
4,"Geat DVD,s ! The forerunner of Downton Abbey","We liked these videos because of the period setting of the English gentry of the pre-WWI period. Unlike Downton Abbey, there are some crusty and eclecric people in this series, but that helps make the tale interesting These videos should appeal to people who like early twentieth century British drama films."
3,"Not bad, but not the final word, either","This is a decent book for an introduction to the wards, but is certainly not the be all and end all for step 2. It should be targeted much more for second year students getting their first exposure to bedside medicine, and presents a nice and digestible look at approaches to various common conditions.Use it for what it is and don't expect it to save your life, either on the wards or the USMLE, and it'll do just fine by you. Not bad, but again, not complete enough or in depth enough to make it a must-have resource."
4,Good for reference,"Medicine is a big topic, and I found this book useful as a reference tool. It's quick to flip to the chapter and read the 3-4 pages of diagnosis/management/whatnot and/or scan the numerous tables. If it were comprehensive, it would be as big as Harrison's or something. So for the Shelf exam, this book is good for brushing up. If you really need to hunker down and learn, I recommend using something else (and I unfortunately have no tips on that topic)."
2,Who was the moron who edited this book?,"This book is absolutely rife with grammatical and spelling errors. If poor editing (or, more likely in this case, NO editing) bothers you, do NOT buy this book, as you will be too distracted by the numerous errors to concentrate on the content. Here are some of the more blatant examples from chapter 70: Paraneoplastic's Disorders; Endocrine's Disorders; Neurologic's Disorders; Hematologic's Disorders; Dermatologic's Disorders. Please, people -- it's called spell check, or use your half of a brain and hire a real editor."
1,China Junk,"I dont know why we buy this kind of stuff from China. It is junk. I had to rethread the shaft so I could get a nut on it. the galv coating filled the threads and the nut that was on it was very hard to remove and was useless after getting it off.Don't buy this if you want to use it for what it is made for. I ordered the 5/8"" eye bolts and got China Junk also."
3,Headphones only,"Headphones only. Pianoforte not enough level.Try Christine Schornsheim, Burkhardt Glaetzner, New Leipzig Bach Collegium Musicum on Laserlight. They got the level right, and the performances are better."
2,over priced!,Don't buy this item here. Get it at your pet store or even WallMart for half the price (without shipping). It's not their fault. Their charge for shipping is equal to the price of the comb.
1,Very disappointing,"This album is not organ music. It may be a ""magic keyboard"" but it has none of the quality, depth or color of organ music. I certainly didn't expect pipe organ music given the selections but it should at least sound like a real electric organ. It doesn't. The tonal quality is much like an acordian or squeeze box."
5,Great Quality & Value,"This is a very well-made, high quality table at an incredibly reasonable price. It is sturdy enough to handle the weight of a full-size person and a massage therapist -- with no or minimal shaking or swaying from deep tissue or percussion work. Some have questioned the durability of the materials and construction; I don't agree. While it may not be durable enough for every day professional use in a spa, it is more than strong enough for at home use by a single or a couple, which is what most people are probably looking for. Also great design -- very simple to set up and folds into an easy to store size and shape. Finally, I recommend this width -- more comfortable for you and the therapist than the 25 inch width, but the 30 inch seemed like overkill for at home use. Again, I'm greatly impressed by the quality and value of this product."
1,Still don't have mine either.,Ordered it 16 days ago ... still hasn't shipped ... and no correspondence from the seller. :-(
1,Am I ever going to get product?,18 days and counting...still hasn't shipped....don't expect to get item on time...if ever
1,"Flimsy, Weak, Narrow and you have to pay the cost to send it back!!!","This was the first massage table that I bought and I was realy disappointed.It arrived on time BUT it is very flimsy, besides its very narrow (NOT 25 Inch as advertised but 23 !!!), as soon as I was unpacking it, the support of the head broke!!!, I found it very difficult to assembly and the support is not secure at all!!!. This is because of the poor quality and eventough this is NOT my fault I had to pay for the shipping costs to send it back PLUS tha amount of the super saver shipping cost that I took advantage!!! This is completely NOT FAIR!!!I wouldn't recommend this table massage at all!!!Save your money!!! I found at Sams a very good quality massage table for 207!!!"
1,The worst massage table EVER,This was my first massage table i have ever purchased and i have to say it is a piece of junk. i am finally half way through school and im geting ready to open my practice. Since my budget is tight i figured how bad can the table be it was at a good price ya know. I recieved the table today and i was instantly disapointed from th moment i opened the package. i thought to my self this table is not sturdy at all and what kind of legs are these. i wasnt expecting a beauty but this thing should be sold at the dollar store. i recommend buying a table only if you see it and are happy with the quality of it. now i have to go through returning it and geting a new one. this tables dosnt even deserve one star.
5,Matty's table,This table will be used by a 12 year old young boy with disabilities. the fact that it is adjustable makes it helpful for otheruses than massage. the quality seems very good and we will let you know if it does not stand the test of time
4,portable massage table,I use this product once a week to massage my wife for medicinal purposes. For the limited uses and the reasonable cost I'm happy with the way the product performs.
1,"weak table, don't buy it!!!!","i bought massage table before, but with steel legs which more stable and stronger. i bought this one because i thought it would be lighter when compare the weight but it's not worth it.believe me buy one with steel legs not wood, it's way much better."
3,Shipping problems alleviated?,"I think the company has worked out the shipping problems. I received my table in about 2 weeks. However, I'm only giving it 3 stars because I haven't had time to open the package yet and check out the quality of the table."
4,Not bad for the money,We have a masseuse come to our house to give us massages. She use to have her own table but it got to be too heavy for her. We bought this cheap one which isn't near as nice as hers but for the money it works well. One time the face rest dropped off and scared me to death. It doesn't attach easily but it does stay on if you do it right. I really do think this table is worth the money. I am glad we didn't buy a more expensive table.
4,My first table,This is my first table. And I really like the ease of setting up the table. The padding is great. Not to thick and not to soft. And it is really easy to clean. I would recommend this as a good starting table for anyone doing massage and energy work.
2,Crap,"The thermometer is horribly inaccurate. The medicine dispensers come with the medicine, so that's useless. I got 3 bulb syringes and 3 combs from the hospital. Everything else bought separately would be cheaper."
3,Buy products individually.,I rarely use most items in this kit. I use the brush and comb and nail clippers the most. I do not like the nasal bulb at all. Wouldn't buy again.
2,Not very secure,"Since these don't have unique keys (each set is the same), anyone could buy a set a of these and use them to take off your wheels. Various bike mechanics I've spoken to didn't recommend them for that reason."
2,Tighten How?,"I could not make these skewers work for my application. I tried to use these skewers to secure a single-speed rear wheel to a vintage frame. Single-speed bikes require the chain to be tightened periodically as the chain wears. These skewers do not allow for the user to secure the rear wheel to a frame with horizontal or semi-horizontal drop-ins. I could not generate the compression necessary to secure the wheel to the frame. Conventional quick releases work better because after you tighten them, the lever allows for you to generate extra compression. Bolted axles are still the best."
4,A concise overview of Church History,This book provides charts and outlines that provide a concise overview of Church History and highlights. It is a good template that can be used to design Sunday school or history lessons.
2,Barely even gets warm,"I've tried various types of heat pads, pain relieving ointment pads (my favorite is Tiger Balm). I purchased this item on sale for use on a long flight. Directions say do not adhere directly to your skin, since the pad may get too warm. It is supposed to take 20 minutes to warm up, but never really warmed up, and was definitely not hot at all. Two stars for the only thing I liked - the adhesive, it stuck to my shirt and stayed there."
3,F350 GMC Tailgate Protector,"This protector is the type that curves around the top of the tailgate, however the protector was not bent enough to conform to the shape of the tailgate. I had to bend it some more for it to be an acceptable fit. I would not have expected this as it should have been in the correct form from Dee Zee. I expected more from this company. Also, the web site provides a very poor description of this item and it is impossible to tell what type you buying. Since there are two different types of these tailgate covers, the pictures should give a good detail of the item. I had to contact Dee Zee direct to get the correct part number for my application. As it is, both items have the same picture but they are very different and are not interchangeable. I must say that customer service is the best I have dealt with, bar none. They set an example of how customers should be treated and I do thank you for that."
3,Rent before you buy,"I have never played any of the Nights games before, and maybe that's my problem, but I had no idea what was going on in this game. Unlike many Wii games that overdo the tutorials, this one explained how to fly and then left me very confused as to what else I had to do. This took the fun out of the game, as it's not really a strategy/puzzle game as far as I could tell. As other people have mentioned, it's frustrating to have to re-do a level if you fail to beat the boss the first time around. I gave up after a couple attempts at my first ""dream"" level (so glad I rented it!).The controls for flying are a little off, but the graphics are excellent. I think giving it 3 stars is a little generous, but other people seem to like it. So I'd rent it before you buy it just to make sure you'll like it before you spend $[...]."
3,Gotta love the classics,"Now don't let the three stars throw you off. This game is creative, cute and not as easy as some might tell you. It's not omg complex but the levels are quite fun. From hunting the octo to saving nights and the boss battles. Will's story was kind of drawn out. How the owl and nights talk to him seems a bit crude and harsh as to how they treat 'Helen'. I say that because they are much kinder to her and a lot sweeter in their speech. The levels start out different aswell. I love sassy and elegant bad guys and Rela(??) fits that to a 'T', he's mean to nights from slamming him into the door and cuffing him and throwing him in jail. He openly mocks will and helen(yet again nicer to helen then will). All and all it is worth the $19.99(got it for $9.99 at a black friday sale). Oh and the Wii remote thing is no problem use the game cube one(duh kinda obvious)"
1,Truly Awful!!,"One of the worst ever made. Cumbersome controls on the WII, frustrating save options. Just a waste of time."
2,None of the magic that made the Saturn classic a beloved memory,"Journey of Dreams tries to be too much and thus deviates too far from the NiGHTS formula. Only a few stages of the game mirror the original's gameplay, but even those stages fail to replicate the score attack gameplay that made the original NiGHTS so unique. What had been a score attack quasi racing game has now become a run-of-the-mill platformer.Although I purchased two copies of this game upon its release, kind of a thank you to Sega, Saturn fans, STAY AWAY!"
2,Change the Rating on this One,"The rating on this game needs to be changed. Currently it's rated as 'E' for everyone 6 yrs+. It needs to be changed to 'E10yr+'(everyone 10years +) or 'T'(teen) due to the scariness of the images. My 7year old chose this game and we couldn't get through the introduction. The kids with red eyes look evil and could give any kid under 10 nightmares of their own. Based on the other reviews, this appears to be a good game but I would definitely recommend reviewing this one before allowing the younger kids to play."
3,Good idea...Awful controls!,"Going in circles made this game really hard, and they should have made it so that Nights could go underwater! I didn't think the story was boring at all, but the controls made it just too hard to enjoy playing. The bosses were too hard, even for my dad, and even though we played with all the different types of controllers, none of them worked well enough to control Nights. You don't get enough time to play the levels, and when my dad finally got almost all the way through one of the levels, he got beat by one of the bosses and had to start over at the beginning. We both liked the storyline, but got totally frustrated and both of us quit playing this game."
4,Mikie loves it!!,"I bought this for my boys, AND MIKIE LIKES IT - HE REALLY LIKES IT!!Entertaining but not too hard, the boys have played it almost non-stop since they got it. They've beaten it several times and enjoy conquering games, as long as they're not too easyMikie's 10, Geoffrey's 11.Game on, Boys!!!"
4,i played this in my late teens early twenties,"I was so happy I found this for my Wii. I use to play this on my sega, but with moving and leaving home. I do not have my sega anymore. I love that I have this game again. just as great as i remember it."
3,Dreams?,"Well, I dreamed with a very well-done remake for NiGhts when I first heard about it on the Wii. The game is there. But SEGA, perhaps in a hurry, forgot to actually test the game's playability and controllers response accordingly. The controls response will put a poker face on you. People like me who had the opportunity to play NiGhts into Dreams (the original game for the SEGA Saturn and now reprogrammed for home PCs) didn't waited for much but at least better graphics (wich Wii certainly can handle) AND the same playability... the game worths, but patience is needed with the controls."
5,Awesome!,I attended a seminar by the authors and it include works from the book. Within two weeks of the seminar I met an awesome guy. We have started dating and he really makes me happy. Before the seminar I never felt happy with any of the guys I met. I am now more clearly recognize the healthy traits men have and what are my old issues that cause problems. I feel releaved that I have a good start to a healthy relationship.
5,Tasty and Satisfying Read,"This mystery has everything that a great mystery should: humor, intricate plotting, a shocking and puzzling murder, smart believable characters, and a cozy little town where nothing bad should ever happen. Once I got caught up in the story, I did not want to put the book down. The twists and turn were quite unexpected and I was riveted by the interesting people and their relationships until the very last page."
5,Bobby Jaye Allen Scores Another Hit,"On the Chopping BlockBobby Jaye AllenWhat a delight to enter the lives of our friends in Early again.The local librarian has been the one chopped and we are led on the chase of the killer(s).Once again we are offered clues and can try to guess up to the end just who is responsible for the murder. We get to revisit old friends such as Brady Kincaid and also meet new ones like Alice Drinker.I for one hope to be able to continue into this little window of their lives.Thanks Ms Allen, you have scored another hit with this reader."
1,This book is borring dribble,"If the reader wants a series of borring, unimaginative, and childish ""stories"" this is the book for you. Harlan has a way of boldly stating facts and ideas in this book as though they are his own when in reality, they are the same tired old stories, ideas, and viewpoints you have heard from many many other people over the years. In the end you kind of feel sorry for the guy. Doesn't Harlan know what this makes him look like?"
1,VERY TINY,"I had purchased this and the taxi/police car set for my nephew for Christmas thinking, from the pictures, that this was much larger! I was extremely disappointed, so much so that I did not give it to my nephew. Unfortunately, with the shipping costs, it's not worth returning either, so I'm just stuck. Nice."
1,This doesn't work,"If I could give it no stars I would - we have been through two of them and the back lift gate does not stay up - total bummer. If it worked, it would be great."
1,Ridiculously tiny.,"I seriously can't believe how tiny this thing is. Was supposed to be a Christmas gift but I'll have to buy something else. If I had mice, I'd give it to them to play with."
3,Great toy if it weren't for two key issues...,"I bought this to go with the parking garage. He absolutely loves the garage. There are two frustrating issues with this car transporter.#1 - it comes unhitches very easily#2 - the back gate does not stay upBetween those two frustrations, my son is very un-nerved by the toy. However, it's really cute how the cars fit on it and he seems to really like the concept. I thought ours was defective, but it seems others have the same issue with the back gate. I would expect for $13+ dollars for the details to be worked out. I am going to return it."
2,Why haven't they fixed this?,"My son got the Plan City car transporter for Christmas to go with the road system that Santa brought. I love Plan City and all the pieces of it, but this one frustrates my 2-1/2 year old. I completely agree with the two main complaints addressed by other reviewers, which are:1) the two pieces (the trailer and cab) come unhitched too easily. It allows for it to turn easily, but they come apart all the time. My son can put it back together now, but still, they should come up with a way to fix this.2) the door on the back has no way to ""lock"" upright, so it always flips down and the cars slide off. This is especially irritating with the road system that includes the bridge, because the car transporter cannot go uphill to cross the bridge - the cars slide right off! Duh. Again, seems like Plan Toys would have immediately realized this and fixed it, because it was immediately apparent to us!"
5,Nice Surprise,I ordered this thinking it was the old Leavitt Method Book with a different cover. It is not that book. It's about a step below the regular method books; great for beginning students of all ages. There are some nice duets and good exercises for the beginning reader.
2,Awful and boring.,"There's much better material for beginners out there now. This is a dated approach and less than stimulating. The best method I've seen is ""Learn and Master Guitar"" by Steve Krenz. Expensive, but excellent."
1,Very expensive,"If you can find the entire brush at your local store, just buy a new complete brush every time you need it."
4,Five star,LIke I said. I like the sulcabrush handle/tips and I will purchase a set for my daughter. I feel lucky to find this product.
4,Barbie Talks Some More,Loved the book. Great Storytelling! A bygone age - that everyone interested in Barbie's and Mattel's history must read.
2,Not Worthy of Shute,"I'm a huge Shute fan. I have virtually all of his books, sometimes in multiple editions. I bought this to fill out my set. However, the publication of this early draft as a finished book does not do Nevil a service. It's like reading a class assignment where the students are asked to write a short story in the style of Shute.I'm not a big fan of books based on unfinished manuscripts where the writer dies before he finished. But a manuscript published post mortem where it is clear the author didn't choose to publish it, that sucks.Just writing this has caused me to reduce my rating from 3 to 2."
4,Great meal supplement,This is a great meal replacement shake that is easy to mix with a cup shaker. I am currently back on a weight lifting program and this has been a major help in meeting my protein needs. I recommend that you drink lots of water while taking this product. The most major benefit of drinking this is that it significantly cuts my temptations for sweets and breads. It doesn't hurt that it tastes great as well. I star deduction because sometimes it upsets my stomach.
4,pretty nice,The head wrap seems to work for me even though it's obvious you're not getting anything special. It looks decent when I'm out working.
4,The Still Imploring Flame,"Hart Crane is the paragon of great American orphic poetry - yes, such a thing did (does?) exist. At a time when American poets were taking the turn inward to represent human consciousness through their style in a way that was immediately familiar to itself, Hart Crane stood on the perimeter of that boundary; unwilling to traverse it, or stand outside of it. It is such that a wholistic mysticism pervades each poem in its irreducibility to the subject or the bystander. Each is, in its own way, immediately personal and declarative. Like Whitman - though I whince at the comparison - the poem proceeds as a profound declaration whose import can only be marked on the fringes of itself as a whole."
4,Pleasant and Peaceful,"This was my first recording of the Brahms Requiem and has remained so after years of hearing many versions.The soloists are truly sensitive singers. Hagegard is now my favorite baritone soloist. He is able to make any piece of music dramatic. Sylvia McNair, a silky voice, demonstrates a lot of restraint and power in her interpretaion of this masterwork.What I truly love is the tempos. As I listen, Masur takes it at exactly what I want to hear. The New York Philharmonic is able to do anything that Masur wishes: they caress, swell, and climax in such a way as to send chills.The true stars in this recording is the Westminster Choir. The diction is fresh, crisp and clean. The vowels are truly Germanic, and the dynamics are very flexible. This recording is out and out good. This is the best in the series of Masur's live recordings. The coughs and digital watches are non-existant. Try this one out!"
1,"Too small for an ""Adult""","The package says it is an Adult size, but why do I feel like it is more for a child's head? This might fit on someone who has a size 18"" head. I'm around 21"" but 23"" if I grow my hair out to medium length."
2,Too small,"It looks like it would be a sturdy swim cap if it fit. I should have listened to other reviews, but I had never thought of myself having a large head. (My hat size is small to medium).I wouldn't recommend this swim cap for an adult.The product description is also wrong. There is no zippered pouch."
3,The quality and the fit,"I've used my first Speedo silicon cap for 2+ years, for at least 4 times a week in a pool. It has held up beautifully.However, I am always struggling to pull it down over my ears. It quickly rides up. It fits well down on my forehead, but doesn't stay down on the ears. Could the design be improved? Thanks"
4,Keeps My Long Hair 90% Dry,"I know that swim caps are more about being streamlined in the pool than keeping one's hair dry, but I hate having to wash my hair more often than is needed because it reeks of chlorine.With a simple braid, I'm able to keep my mid-back length hair (which isn't thick) tucked inside the cap with only minimal pool-water exposure.NOTE though that as I am currently pregnant, so I swim using a kick board and don't fully submerge my head...mostly only face in. But this cap keeps the front of my hair from getting wet.On the occasion I submerge my head or do an extended back stroke, more water seeps in through the back, but I suppose that can't be helped."
3,Speedo swim cap,"I have a large head and long hair this cap is a little too tight, but still wearable. I learned that you must wet your hair at first before you put it on or air gets trapped under the cap. My hair still gets chlorine water on it especially in the back of my head where I put my hair in a bun. At least it's better than wearing no cap at all. I swim 4-6 days a week and chlorine is too damaging to my hair. It's kind of a hassle to put on each time and it really squishes my forehead."
4,good,"Good swim cap, better than the one I used before. And this swim cap is very easy to be washed. There is only a week point of the cap is the cap is a little too tight for me, maybe my head is too big."
5,great swim cap,"This works so much better than my old one. The old one really was worn out, but I didn't realize it until I got the new one. I think they improve on these caps every time I get one."
1,speedo silicone swim cap,Received swim cap and my daughter wore it for 1 hour during swim practice. The second day it broke. Never had a swim cap cost so much for one hour of wear.
2,translucent material,"I was expecting a solid red but this cap it almost translucent. I bought a black one, a gray one and a blue one and I didn't have that problem with any of them."
2,staticy swim cap,"This swim cap is very staticy, when I use it for the first time, my hair stand up because of static electricity."
4,speedo as usual awesome quality,"awesome quality awesomw purchase, though costly but you can feel its comfort and style. it gives full cover to hair and head and save from pool water"
2,ripped,I bought this for my 7year old who swims a lot and does know how to put on a swim cap. The cap ripped the third time she used it. Looking for something a bit more durable next time.
2,Speedo Swim Cap,The cap is too tight. The only reason I can think of is that the silicone is too thick and tries to retain its original form. I do not have problems with TYR silicone caps.
2,swim cap,"this cap was too small for my head (and no, my head isnt abnormally large) and it does little to keep my hair dry. it also pinches my ears."
4,100% Silicone Swim Cap,"100% Silicone Swim Cap. Nice swim cap. I have to wear it really low on my forehead or it wants to slide up and off. This was the only one that said it was 100% Silicone, (not latex)."
1,RETURNED TO SENDER AND NOT REFUNDED,I RETURNED THE ITEM ALMOST A MONTH AGO AND DID NOT RECEIVE MY MONEY BACK.
1,Speedo Swim Cap,Save your money and don't buy this. I ordered it early for a May vacation. There was not one dry strand of hair on my head. This is totally useless as a swim cap. Since I didn't use it until May it was past the April 30th return date. Total waste of money and I would not recommend anyone buying this. I had to give it one star because it wouldn't accept the review without it but it deserves NO STARS!
1,It can not keep my hair dry,I want a silicone swim cap to keep my hair dry when in the pool but it failed. I do not like this one.
2,Not a great product,"The fit is not snug. Get one size smaller than you would guess at first. Fit is IMPORTANT. If it is doesnt fit exactly, either your head will hurt or tiny air pockets will irritate you when underwater even for a second."
3,What a swim cap,"I got this to go with my swimsuit, to protect my hair from the chlorine. I had never worn a swim cap before, but I couldn't get this on my head without tearing out a bunch of hair. I ended up returning it. Good quality material though."
1,Ouch!!!!,"I am giving this to my elementary school aged niece because this is way too tight on my head. I am only 5'1"" and have an average sized head, I think. This arrived today and it is entirely too tight. I ordered the pink one, if that helps.I have hair that is a little below my shoulders and there is no way that I would have attempted to even try to put it up into this cap. It most certainly would have torn."
1,It Tore,"Wore it about 5 times before it ripped. Worked fine until then, but of course now I can't use it. I hope I can return it to Amazon!"
5,best swimcap,"It's great. It's a swimcap. it does what swimcaps do. it's speedo, so you can trust it. That's about all there is to say!"
5,Works as advertised!,The material is stretchy and appears to be fairly durable. Its a little hard to get on but I have fairly long hair and a big head (size 7 3/4 in). Totally worth the price - I would absolutely purchase another one.
1,too small,I expected this cap to be sturdier and have room for my ears. It is on the thin side and hardly covers my ears. Wearing ear plugs under it will be a challenge.
2,The color is beautiful but....,"I loved the color of this swimming cap, but at least for me, is so tight that I can't wear it. I had to return it.I'm still looking for one that is more comfortable."
4,just what you need,im a begginer and this is the first cap i use... for me is great is confortable it doesnt move it stays in it place... i have used it for a month and the product looks just like the day i opened it doesnt have any funny smell. i think is agood cap for my needs
4,It's pink,Gel caps are good. They are all good. I got hot pink because I swim in open water and want to be seen
4,Beautirful color! only one star off becuase my head is too big!,"I love this swim cap, this was my first swim cap ever and unfortunately I can't get it to stay on my head. It's just too tight for me. It's not that my hair won't fit either, it's the bad around my head that just slides up and off very easily. I love the color, and the shimmeryness of this cap, and will keep trying to find one that will stay on. I really do think it's my beg head that's the problem, not the cap!"
5,No Problems,"I've had no problems with this swim cap. I've used it on wet & dry hair; and it hasn't ripped on me yet. I probably used it only around ten times, so far, however."
2,Cap too small has to return,I do not know whether someone can fit into this cap with the size of his/her head not too small? I did not and had to return it.
1,Too little and/or bad quality?,"I used the cap 2 times, it was a bit little so not very easy to put on. The second times I used it, it ripped. Sorry but I think it deserve 1 star."
1,Too small and gets smaller with time. Pops out when swimming.,Almost impossible to put on and keep on when swimming. Rolls right off. At first it fit tight but got tighter each time.
1,Worthless- I bought 3 silicone caps- Speedo is the worst!,"I bought three swimming caps- One Speedo and two View brand silicone caps. I have worn the View caps about 30 times...no problem. The Speedo I wore ONCE-it did not stay on very good. I did not like it very much. However, I was wearing a red suit and wanted to wear a cap that matched. So I gave it another try-it tore.. So I wore it once...ONLY ONCE. What a waste of money.I have experience putting on the caps so I know it was the poorly made cap.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE>Try the view brand - it is cheaper and better made."
2,small Child sized/ or extra small head and or no hair,"I guess if you have a tiny head and no hair this might fit. Otherwise this is too small. But, If you have no hair, then why would you need this? It hurts getting it on and off, and is simply too small."
2,Way too tight,The material is good simple silicon. It is just too small. I don't have a big head and I have headache after wearing it for 10 minutes.
1,NOT for adults!,"This cap is TINY TINY TINY! I can't even get this thing halfway down my head (and i have a regular sized head)! I'm very disappointed in Speedo, they should re-label this item FOR KIDS!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good cap,"I just ordered this cap, though looking is good and quality is also good but initially while using it i didnt feel comfortable because sometime its pulled upward automatically and i my hairs get wet in the water..may be in future it expand more to fit properly. Hope for that :))But now I am finding this cap really good. Though initially I was facing some problem to put it on my head but eventually its good for my head. But unable to cover my forehead and back nech area hair, but still a good purchase."
2,Buy a VIEW 6/15/11 UPDATE,"I expected a lot more from Speedo. Although I do swim a lot -- 12 miles per week -- I still expected this cap to last more than 9 months before tearing. However, I now need to look for one that doesn't fit so tightly, doesn't ever give me a headache, never rides up on forehead, and keeps the hair dry. This one failed in all those categories, in addition to ripping despite carefully putting it on and always drying it off after swimming.A major disappointment!6/15/11 Update:Compared to the VIEW cap I purchased, the more expensive Speedo isn't worth your time. The View is a bit heavier, doesn't slip up on forehead as much, more comfortable (no more headaches), and did I mention, LESS expensive."
3,Isn't my hair supposed to be dry?,"After reading other people's reviews, I guess I didn't really know what a swim cap was for. I bought it with the idea that it would keep my hair dry so I could go to work after swimming, and not have to wash and dry my hair. Sometimes when I use it, my hair is partially wet, and sometimes my hair is fully wet. I'm sure it's still helping to save my hair from the cholorine, but I was hoping for better protection."
2,disappointed,Uncomfortable around the ears and rides up constantly. They do not stay in place well at all. Lets a lot of water into cap as well
2,Speedo Swim Cap,"I'm a beginner swimmer so I don't know if this is normal but my hair still gets wet. To be fair I do have a lot of hair but I wear the the cap according to the instructions and though my hair may not be soaking wet after my swimming lesson, it's still wet. I'm gonna search for another cap perhaps something that will provide better protection from the water seeping in."
2,Gives me a headache and doesn't work,"After a couple hours' use, this cap had already failed and my hair got wet, plus it leaves marks on my forehead and gives me a headache from how tight it is. I assume all swim caps have these same problems so I have nothing against Speedo in particular, but this was a purchase I regret and would never recommend to anyone."
4,Tough to get on with long hair,"This product is tough on long hair. However my daughter prefers this silicone style to the speedo Lycra that hurts her ears because of a band that is used to keep cap on.The material is like the rubber material, it grabs and tugs at hair."
4,Does the job,This swim cap simply does the job. This one fits very snugly and is fairly comfortable when talking about swim caps.
4,Great Swim Cap,I think this swim cap does a good job of being a swim cap. It does not hurt to put on and is fairly easy to adjust. It seems to be quite durable and not prove to sticking together.
4,Book arrived as advertised,"I ordered this book because of the great memories I have of that season and the Boston Celtics. The story line explains how the 1985-1986 team was assembled and provided background material on each player. It didn't provide a game-by-game review of the season but did highlight important games.The book I received, while technically ""used"" looked as if it was just off the printer's press. I would definitely order again from this vendor."
3,"Would have gotten 4 stars, except",The canvas band is horrible.. the blue face is really nice.. but the canvas freys and makes it difficult to use.. after wearing it MAYBE 10 times I had to get my son a different band. I think id still get it tho.. for the price the blue face is real pretty!!
4,Bringin back the Wu,"First off, I'd rate this 4 1/2 out of 5 stars. This album is bringing back the old Wu formula- kung fu samples, sick RZA, tru master and mathematics production, and chock full of Wu fam appearances. Every song is really good, the only subpar song to me is Love Spell. If you like the wu or just good hip hop, then this album is for you."
5,last banger dropped by ODB,"Other reviewers have already pointed out what everyone already should know; this is a dope album. With the passing along of Big Baby Jesus, the one-man army Ason, it needs to be noted that track 12 is ODB at the best he's been in years. They kept my man away from cocaine, alcohol and his own crazy ass long enough to get him to drop some classic Old Dirty rhymes on that one. The album stands as a 5 star effort on it's own but the old dirty track is a juicy little bonus snuggled among great production by the likes of mathematics and inventive lyrics and flows. Buy this ish immediately."
4,Yeah!,"I've been waiting for this disc forever! Everyone keeps dissing all Wu solo stuff, which 75% deserve this dissing, but people seem to forget all GZA/Genius stuff, U-God, Inspectah Deck and early Meth. All the solo stuff has golden nuggets of beauty but the bad parts way overshadow the good stuff. This album, is brilliant. Secret Rivals and Old Man are brilliant, it's worth buying for those two songs alone. Everyone should buy this album, especially those Wu fans jumping ship."
5,Best Wu Album since 'Supreme Clientele',"The Last member of the wu to bring out a solo album, Jamel Irief takes you back to the glory days of the wu with this one. basically, if youre a wu fan who hasnt been listening to the wus recent output, its time to cop this. it features the whole clan, has production from rza, true master & mathematics and is goddamn hittin!. basically this is a classic joint. people might sleep but the wu is always on point, and this shows it. my favorite tracks are the ODB & Rza featured old man (a track sampled, quite obviously on an M.I.A. song), the Police Woman sampling title track, and beautiful Queen.if you like wu this is their classic for the new millenium, ya digPeace"
5,Now this is more like it...,"If your a fan of the Wu or just appreciate great hip hip, pick this up. While the airwaves are being flooded with bubblegum rap, Mastah Killah brings that classic Wu sound. Intelligent, grimey, etc. This has been way overdue. Now only if more of the wu members would follow suit. What happened Meth?"
4,Black rage raaa raaaa,"I joined up just to write this review. First things first: For all the people that said that they slept on Masta Killa before this album I have one question. Did you listen to his verse on Glaciers of Ice describing a battle-scene??? Listen to that verse over and over until you get it...I have been waiting for this album since that verse. At first I have to say that I was dissapointed and to hell I still am dissapointed. I wanted an album that captured a tension of ten years without a real voice. I did not get that. The sound was too polished and studioed. I want dusty beats but oh well the album is ok and a worthy purchase if you like the WU. My favorite tracks are Silverbacks, School and that breakdancing track Digi Warfare is pretty good. Mathematics dropped the ball on his produced tracks. They were just too smooth jazzsy/keyboardsy for me. ""Mathematics knock it off!"" Masta Killa's album is ok, not a bad purchase."
2,whats up with the reviews?,"I have seen other reviews and have noticed that a lot of you people seem to be retarded. This album was not as good as I thought it would be, I saw myself skipping a lot of the songs. Its a shame that it took him this long to come out with an album and it bombed this bad. If your not sure about getting this album do yourself a favor and get another wu-member cd, other than U-God of course, haha. Do not knock down my review, I've listened to every album the wu had to offer and I was pissed when I was towards the end of this album and nothing really stood."
1,This product doesn't work!,"When it works, it's great, but so far we've tried to open six wine bottles, and four times this product pushed the cork down in the neck of the bottle rather than extracting the cork."
5,"Classic paper, plus plus why, PLUS where too now","This book contains all of Robert Triver's best papers.In addition, each is book-ended between a two short essays outlining the background to Professor Trivers' initial exploration and thinking behind the paper, often including quite intriguing sociological contexts. Then, which is extremely valuable, Triver's brings the reader up-to-date with the subsequent history of the idea in that paper: who did it influence? Does he still believe it? What is the current hot take on the area?It is a magnificent tribute to a life-time of work, and valuable for anyone active in the area of evolution."
1,Disgusted and completely ill,This review has nothing to do with music whatsoever.What makes me ill and so utterly disgustedis how sellers are demanding such high costfor praise music to God.Maranantha Praise singers is a favorite of mineand has been growing up as a believer. I am lookingfor my father who is just now discoveringGod and Christ. Can you imagine my disgust and surprisewhen I get on Amazon to find some Marantha musicto send him ON CD...and some albums are goingfor the riduculous price of $99.99 ...that's Album 4.Album 8 is what...like $70.99. What the heck?!Even used albums going for $40.00 !This is what angered Jesus when he overturnedthe tables in the temple.I really wonder what he thinks of people tryingto make a fast buck off praise music.I'll go download music from youtube Amazon.I'm disgusted beyond belief.
1,"Cheaply constructed, and defective!","This product arrived defective and broken. It's cheaply constructed, and I do not recommend it."
2,Started out good but...,"This book is definitely readable -- short chapters, clearly identified povs. But I really felt it hard to feel connected to the four women -- really connected, that is. The timeline moves quite quickly and pov shifts often. I felt as though I was watching a play, and getting to know the characters on a surface level only. Still, the author has a nice writing style."
5,2nd unit,I bought this to replace the same model I'd had for 6 months. Very happy to have found exact match. Would highly recommend.
2,lacking professional quality,"Although there are plenty of categories and choices, the quality of the graphics is not very high on most of the images. Although there are nice graphics throughout, majority are cartoonish or sketch-type that are not suitable for business publications. There is no catalog, of course, so you have to browse through the thousands of images. And worse yet, the Web graphics cannot be previewed by the viewer so you're left at guessing until you paste it into your own software. Some good graphics, but you shouldn't count this being your only clip art source if you're working on professional publications."
1,Avoid,"This was one of our worst purchases. Rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better! The snorkle and mask were constant problems, leaking, filling with water, etc. We had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up."
4,worked very well!,"We purchased these for our vacation to hawaii, they worked great! we have snorkeled a few times, and these are DEFINATLY worth the money instead of renteding them. the masked fogged up a little but not too bad. the bags to carry them in were also very handy!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"On the plus side...they work. The goggles don't leak & stay tight. The fins stay on just fine.On the negative side...the quality of the materials leaves a bit to be desired.If I had it to do over again, I'd spend a little more money for a better quality set. But if you're on a tight budget, these are definitely for you."
1,Lame,"If your looking for cheap snorkel equipment this is the way to go, but the fins are low quality and I would only wear them if I wanted to get laughed at."
1,Short shelf life,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my father. It arrived quickly, but the expiration date was too soon. For someone used to complete, just add water mixes, I thought this might be a nice change. With such a short expiration date, he didn't feel he would get the time to make this special breakfast before the mix expired. It was a waste of money. I wonder how long this sat on the shelf before it was shipped out."
1,very lacking,"I can't comment on the quality of these bread recipes - because I see no way to bake them. Each recipe gives ingredient amounts for a ""regular"" and a ""large""loaf - but NOWHERE does the book tell you what these mean. So if you're making a ""regular"" loaf, do you set your machine for 1 lb.? 1-1/2 lbs? 2 lbs? I can't believe how thoughtless this is. The main (only?) thing this book has going is glossy full-page pictures. Othwise, there's nothing you can't get in any basic bread machine book. Waste of money."
1,All the Bread Fell,Every recipe in this book sounded great! And every recipe I made in this book fell! So I only work out of The Bread Machine Cookbook V by Donna Rathhmell German. Every recipe out of German's book has been fabulous and raved about by all my guests.
4,Wonderful! Easy to follow! Used every week!,"When I purchased this book, I learned so much about perfecting the art of making great bread in a machine. It teaches tips/mistakes commonly made and ways to correct them. My favorite recipe is for a Jewish bread called: Challah it has egg yolks and 1/4 cup butter and makes great rolls or braided loaves, it's my husband's favorite too. This book is definitely worth its slightly higher price tag, I took it to work and all my friends wanted the recipes!!"
4,Great descriptions and pics,"Not sure if I have the William-Sonoma but my cookbook has this exact cover. I found it at Half-Price Books & it is wonderful. Great recipes, easy to follow instructions, tips and pics."
1,None of the receipes worked,"I tried 3, all three failed. Other receipes have worked out fine, but there is something wrong with these. The guide gives you receipes for 3 sizes of bread machines, but it never tells you the actual size of the bread pans that they 'tested' in. My pan is 6 cups, so I used the smallest receipe each time. And each time - dissapointment. Not recommended."
4,Remember when you were a listener?,"This book is great for us preachers who may have forgotten exactly what it was like being a weekly listener. Van Harn talks about how we are ""listeners"" for our whole community- the church we serve. We listen to what they are dealing with, wondering about, concerned with and help them by putting voice to that from the pulpit. He explores how the Holy Spirit works through preaching; how we are all connected in the ""one holy catholic and apostolic church"" and how the sermon does function as ""word of God."" I used this with my adult Sunday School class to discuss the topic of preaching and what they hear and how they respond. It was very fruitful for us!"
3,Mental Recognition of a great book does not quite cut it,"This is an amazing book, but I wish I could have felt more for the characters. The story had all the elements of danger, intrigue and romance you could hope for, but there was something about the storytelling itself that seemed rather mechanical.The logistical errors in the manuscript drove me crazy . . . doesn't this publishing house (Bantam) proofread anything? Still, it was worth hanging in for the climax. The book is rather long and if you don't read it consistently (ideally, every day) you might lose sight, like I did, of certain details the author brushed over -- seemingly minor points that become important at the end of the book.I can't say I'm now a Sheri S. Tepper fan, but I'm glad I tried at least one of her books. The ending was gripping, I just found the path to get there rather tedious at times. The book didn't take me by the heart."
3,"good world-building, messy ending","I very much enjoyed the first half of this book, that is, I loved learning about the world that Tepper created and was thrilled to know about the different characters and their relations. I didn't like the main character, though, the Orphan, because I never got to feel her from the ""inside""; I just saw her through the other characters' motivations to relate to her,and I never really felt what drove her to act as she did.Nevertheless, the most unsatisfactory part of this novel was its ending; it is as if the author got tired of the story and decided to end it no matter how, leaving the readers with too many questions."
5,A great Science Fairy Tale!,"I love this book, and the way everything that seem so weird and strange fits together. There's a reason and an explanation for everything that happens and this is gradually revealed as you read this novel.It's hard to talk about it without giving the plot away so I'm just goint to tell you that I bought it in hardcover when it was first published, something I rarely do. I usually wait for the paperback, but as a fan of both epic fantasy and thought-provoking science fiction I was really anxious to read this particular genre-bending story, and I can tell you it was worth every penny!"
4,most magical sci-fi I have ever read.,"This book is the most successful combination of sci-fi and fatasy elements that I have ever read. Agian Tepper manages to weave a mystical tale that is thought provoking, as well as entertaining. The tale goes from mid-evil archtype towns right out of Rodgers and Hammerstien, to futuristic suburbs with shocking proficiency. While not quite as good as some of her other books, it would be better if the world were either a little more realistic or a little more aligorical, ""plague of angles"" holds its own with any of the abstract sci-fi out there. What makes Tepper so good is her ability to write books with several levels of meaning without falling into vague or inaccessable metaphors."
1,not worth it,"I read this a while ago, and was thoroughly unimpressed. The plot is disjointed, the characterization nonexistent, the prose style clunky, and the book's attitude on gender relations is irritating and simplistic. Perhpas she had some interesting ideas in there, however, strangely enough (perhaps due to the clunky prose style) they all came off as shallow and undeveloped. Maybe some of her other work is better, but I wouldn't know, as I've never picked up another Tepper book since."
5,Rockin,"Great energy. The band members all have great vocals and are featured on different selections. I saw the Commander at the Santa Monica Civic back in 1973. You feel so good and high after seeing him live. I always tearup during ""I got the Down to Seeds and Stems Again Blues""."
1,Over priced rice crackers,"When you purchase these japanese rice crackers, you are paying for the packaging. This is not a mixture of rice crackers, just one type of rice cracker packed into twelve 3 ounce packages. There are many other rice cracker mixtures on the market, priced from $2.99 to $3.99 per pound."
1,FTP LEAVES YOU NEEDING MORE,"There are many FTP softwares out there and that is why you should most likely keep searching. This software does not run on updated OP/SYS. It does not say that until after you have it installed. Secondly, it has bugs in its update and replace areas, i.e. it doesn't do it well. Over half failed and required multiple name changes and file saves. Also, the only 'help' or 'manual' they offer is a link to an international site where you can type in an email and wait within a week for an answer. This is exactly the opposite that somene who is looking for speed in File Transferring wants. KEEP SEARCHING for $5 bucks more you'll be glad you did."
4,We were lucky,"Ladislas Farrago was there and describes how poorly the US first responded to the U Boats at the beginning of WWII. Lucky for us Doenitz was so sure of himself that he ran a centralized operation that limited the initiative of U Boat commanders. And lucky that Hitler did not ever put sufficient resources to the U Boats war. This book brings much to light that is not generally known. There was a book out after this one -Black Sunday I believe- that covered some of the same material but this one has additional info. Also, it was written during the cold war so it talks about our vulnerability to Russian Subs.Packrat"
3,Love it; Hate it,"I like the cordless features and small profile of the phones. Also, the buttons are just right in their sensitivity. However, I woudl have liked it if the phone book was shared between them. Also, to go thru the phone book take more clicks than it should to find a pheon number."
1,Don't even deserve one star,"I buy this phone when we were moving to a new house, so I can use extra handset upstaires. I did not try it untill after a month, when I moved to new place I tried it. But the second handset doesn't work. It rings but when you pick-up the phone you will just here horrible loud sounds. I contect the staples, but it was more then a month they said they can't do anything about that. So I contected uniden's customer service. They had a horrible customer survice. When I buy this phone I think this was a good deal, but now I tossed it just in my basement. And may be next time when I clean my basement it's going to be in trash. his phone eeven doesn't deserve 1 star,but I can't give it less then one star. If you are planning to buy phone, just spend little more money and go for panasonic. I am using one for 4 years now, and I buy another one with extra handsets from panasonic, and it's working great."
5,This is one classy LCD monitor -- I love it in 2008,"It's interesting to read the older reviews here. I see that I was very fortunate to buy mine at a discount electronics store locally. I bought it used and it works GREAT. I did not know that when new it came with its own software. I plopped down $40 for (online) for PivotPro software in order to easily rotate the screen angles for portrait versus landscape, but the used price was low enough that even with the software I paid half what this monitor cost when it was new.It is just gorgeous. I love it. The stand it is on IS very stable and secure. My son hooked it up for me and as far as I could tell he didn't spend a lot of time with the color or anything. It is just great as is. Wow. I lucked out. It's a beaut...!"
4,Perfect for the Home,I gave this table to my wife for Christmas. At first she could not understand why I even gave this to her. But after a few massages she simply loves it. The table is easy to set-up and put away. I like the fact that the legs can be adjusted to raise the bed and they do not have do be reset to fold the table back up. Very sturdy and comfottable. Perfect for the home.
5,Nice Table - Exchange Policy Excellent,"This is a very nice massage table but I wanted to let everyone know that if for some reason you need to return it the exchange process was a breeze. To my great disappointment my table arrived damaged. To return I went through a one-step process on Amazon, UPS picked it up the next day, and my new table arrived within a week. It's a bummer to receive something that's damaged but the exchange policy was so simple (and free) it was a relief."
1,Dead battery,"While the watch was very stylish and nice, I had to return it because it didn't work. I'm assuming that the battery was dead, but it was disappointing to have the watch not even work when it arrived."
1,Money making scheme - rip off,I view suspiciously authors who change covers of their books and launch a new edition every year or every 18 months.This book as with the 5th edition is sub-standard.If you are stuck with it as a compulsory read - borrow from a library. Don't buy.
1,Just not worth the cost.,"This book is compulsory for a class I am in. Do what I did, don't waste your money - borrow from a library..... or find other solutions. This is way too much money for information that can be covered in other sources. The publisher is clearly exploiting the fact that it is used as a textbook to raise the cost outrageously."
1,Not worth your time.,Basically I had to purchase this for a class. The book is full of acronyms and buzz words with no application. The end of chapter review is great if you just wanted to add new words to your vocabulary and be able to repeat their definitions with little understanding. This is a classic example of a text book gone wrong.
3,book in bad condition but seller offered refund of shipping,"The book was not as specified by the seller (""gift condition""). It had several torn pages, and there was a sticky substance on the top of many pages. The seller did, however, give me a refund of the shipping. I had needed to have the item immediately, so I chose not to return it."
2,The Heart is a lot to the Left!,"Don't be fooled by the innocuous-sounding title of this book. It is filled with some good ideas but the liberal agenda of the book becomes clear by page 2! Mr. Coffin has no respect nor use for anyone in the conservative camp. His compassion is all-encompassing, it would seem, but given a choice between a poor fundamentalist Christian and a wealthy liberal congressman, his choice would clearly be the latter. Didn't Jesus mention something about not judging your brother harshly? Mr. Coffin has judged conservative Christians with all the vitriol that is so characteristic of the liberal community."
1,Horrible!,"These things taste HORRIBLE! I don't know how old the kids are who tried it and liked it, but my 8 year old spit it out immediately. I tried it -- Ug! It tastes like a mix of flinstones vitamins and fish...with more fish. Truly awful. I can't believe I spent money on this. I'll try to take it back. I've already sent a note to the company. The Super Fruit one is horrible too."
2,Basically useless even for beginners,"I had expected this book to introduce me to Vedic Astrology: the basics, and in an understandable way for a Western astrologer. This book does not do that. In fact I am not sure what it does. It is only a few score pages, printed on cheap stock and is not organized in what I would consider a pragmatic way.I've since bought a number of Vedic books so I have a better idea now of the ideas put forth by this book and this author. They are simple enough I suppose for a beginner but only if, perhaps, that beginner is an Indian and has already grown up in a culture where such astrology is commonplace. I think it is useless for a Westerner."
3,The Delmar Smith Method,Has many tips that will work today. Delmar Smith would be an old man by now so some methodology may seem antiquated but it does provide some useful insight. Dogs are still dogs.
1,Best Way to Train Your Gun Dog : The Delmar Smith Method,Me or my spouse did not like this book at all. Some of the techniques of training were cruel. I will be returning the book.
2,Delmar Smith Method,I found the book to contain a lot of negative training methods and rather archaic. It would be nice to find a positive training field book if one is out there.
3,"Good Ideas, but too late in life","Though this book has many good systems to train your dog, it starts them out too late (1 1/2 years old) for basic retrieve and pointing. I also don't agree with the idea of letting a bird dog run rabbits or other animals. The section on Whoa traing is outstanding along with many other methods explained in detail in this book."
3,The classic gun dog training book,"It's the classic and probably most recommended by bird dog trainers. And it is pretty informative, but the author and Delmar have an interesting writing style, very folksy."
4,It belongs in your library,The real strength of this book is that it gets you in the right mindset for gun dog training. The techniques are simple yet ingenious. I've used most of them and built my training foundation around Delmar Smith's principles.Buy this book and several others. See a professional trainer. There's no harm in educating yourself.
3,Partially illuminating,"Cleanly produced guitar-dreamscapes float best when arpeggio-accentuated, chugging along noticeably worse when things speed to mid-tempo grinders. Aside from some of that dead-ish weight, the disc tends to sound a little electronically unsure in its second half, with aimless meanderings that should have brought Lanterna down to an average album. But Frayne's involving atmospherics earlier on make this just over worthwhile."
2,Eh.,"If you're totally lost, this could be a good starting point, but if you actually wrote a personal statement that sounded anything like this you'd come off as a total tool. So if that's what you're going for, great."
2,"For about 1 percent of Applicants, if that","The two stars go in honor of the questions asked early in the book, which do suggest many useful things to include in your statement. Very quickly, however, the book takes a one-way street that only the extreme cases can follow. The example essays include people who have escaped the communist regime of Cuba, been haunted by the Russian KGB, lived in a car, and an Olympic Skier. If you do have an extreme tear-jerker for the academy, buy this book--but that is the only style of essay discussed. If you happen to be among the average applicants, though, and you trying to get an edge, this may not be the right place to look. I am applying to Public Health school, and found more useful info in a book on getting into Law schools. I would suggest checking out the Degree of Difference Series over this book."
3,"no real directions, lots of samples","I was frustrated that there was only one chapter of very general instructions. It was interesting to read successful applicants personal statements, but a lot of them reflected extreme situations that most people have not experienced in their lives. The last chapter has poorly written letters from admissions reps and Deans of Admission that I did not find useful in the slightest. I would have to say that the samples are a good way to get ideas and are the only redeeming quality of the book."
4,"The best furniture polish, great smell, works well","We always used to use guardsman polish when I was growing up. I love the smell, which isn't lemon or orange scented. It's just normal polish and works well on wood. It has a nice consistency when you spray, and even foams up a little, which makes you feel like its working.If it weren't so expensive, it'd have 5 stars. That being said, It's the best polish as far as I'm concerned."
4,not for every surface,"If you need this product, buy the trigger spray instead. It is a better value and better for the environment.I purchased it because Arhaus Furniture recommended it for the products I bought and it does a good job. It is pricey compared to similar sprays but it will be worth it- I hope. Besides- it is just a few bucks more.Use this on closed grain wood with a glossy finnish not on rustic oaky open grain products."
5,If you like shine...,I buy this product for my mother who loves to polish furniture. She swears by it and will not buy anything else so it is a highly recommended item. Your furniture shines like new when applied and it makes her happy so what that's good enough for me!
4,Clean's great! Protects?,"This seems to clean wood cabinets great! But I'm questioning the protection after it's done (as it doesn't seem to leave anything behind, which is good, but wondering on protection of the wood later!)"
2,"I really thought I was going to love this, but sadly I don't","I really thought I was going to love this, but sadly I don't. I do like the way it smells, but that is about it. It's not a shiny finish, which I prefer."
5,Great product,"I always use Murad products and this product is great, too. Have not found a Murad product that has been a disappointment. Nice to have the confidence in the product name to know that it will be a pleasant experience. Great job, Murad."
1,Would not buy,"I bought this from the this vendor and I don't think the product was the real thing. To top it off, they don't accept returns."
1,DONT BUY THIS ONE,IT BURNED OUT AFTER 4.5 MONTHS OF BEING ON ABOUT 2-3 HRS TWICE PER WEEK. I AM PRETTY SURE THIS WAS MADE TO KEEP ON ALL THE TIME INSTEAD OF TWO NIGHTS PER WEEK BUT IT COULD NOT EVEN DO THAT WHICH MAKES THIS JUNK. BUY A DIFFERENT ONE-SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE.
1,Defective nozzle,Just threw out my third half-full can that was unusable due to a broken nozzle. I love this hairspray but am switching to L'Oreal Elnet because I'm tired of wasting money on product I can't use. Sebastian needs to fix this problem.
1,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"When I ordered this product, I assume that I made an error and clicked on the items next to the one I wanted which was the Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray. I received the wrong product which was the regular hair spray. I emailed the company and they said I could return it ""at my leisure"". They signed for the package on 5/12 by someone named Simon and as of today 5/20 there is no refund on my credit card. I would like to know how much longer my refund is going to take as I have already ordered and paid for the shipment of the correct hairspray. Any assistance you can provide me would be greatly appreciated as I am now at $130.00 out of pocket for hairspary.Thank you - Chris Bissell"
2,Not the same Shaper that I've used for years,"I've used Shaper hairspray for many, many years and when my local store stopped carrying it I decided to purchase a few cans from this online store I found on Amazon. Shaper is the best and only hairspray I will use but unfortunately this particular product is just not the same. Have they reformulated? I don't know but I won't order this again."
5,Long hold!,"When I first tried this hairspray I was a little ""iffy"" about it. It held, but it wasn't a STIFF hold. My hair still moved some, but this hairspray lasts for hours! Gives hair hold, but allows movement, and lasts a long time. My favorite hairspray to date! Definitely try it if you haven't yet."
5,Sebastian super plus,I order this product because I love the product and the price is right. I have no other comments to make.
2,disappointed,"I used to use this hairspray and really liked it, but it seems different now. I don't like the fragrance and it is sticky, so I can't move my hair after I spray it. Will not buy this hairspray again."
1,Horrible!,"The formula for this hairspray has changed drastically to comply with new regulations. Sebastian should be ashamed of trying to sell it under the ""old formula"" - it has zero hold - it is nothing like the previous formula at all.This purchase was a waste of $38. The labelling should indicate that the formula has changed. Shame on Sebastian!"
2,Didn't fit...,"I have used this filter on other faucets, but it did not fit one that I had purchased as a gift."
1,This seller is fraudulent. Do not buy from him.,The faucet doesn't fit on my kitchen sink. The 877-688-0581 phone number provided with the faucet for help is a disconnected number. The website address provided with the faucet no longer exists. DO NOT BUY THIS FAUCET.
2,Try Another Brand...,"At first I thought it was fine but than when I changed the filter I had a problem. It never showed it needed to be changed. I called the company and the girl was a little rude and said it would show when it needed changed. Well, she was wrong. When I finally decided something was really wrong I took it off and it was loaded with mold so BEWARE. NEVER will I purchase another PUR product."
3,Great! For about a month,"I think my complex has water that is a little dirtier than most. They are constantly turning the water off to replace old pipes. When the water comes back on, all the water is pretty brown for a bit. This filter was great for about a month, and then it literally dripped water out of it for the next 3 months. I would put the container under it, turn it on, go take a shower, and read some of a book, come back, and it would maybe be filled.It was cheap, easy to install, but I'd prefer a filter unit with replaceable filters instead."
4,"Works great, saves $$","This filter works very well to improve the taste of tap water. It is also far more economical than buying replacement cartridges for a nondisposable filter, as these cartridges can be quite pricey and get used up too quickly to warrant the price. I use filtered water for cooking and I find that this Clear Flow disposable filter only lasts about 5 months for our family, which is surprising since it claims to last one year. It is still the best deal for us (we've tried many filter systems) so we will continue to purchase."
3,"Cheap, but does the job","This sweater is not made of the best quality fabric nor has the best lettering (iron-on quality). but hey, but sometimes you get what you pay for. I just needed something real quick and cheap to wear for the Bowl in 2007."
4,great collections of differing reviews,"i liked this book a lot because it included intelligent reviews from people of all different opinions. although some negative reviews made me extremely angry (i'm a huge eminem fan), they were well thought out and not just blind perspectives from various bystanders. excellent source of people's opinions of eminem."
4,timmy review,The book White Noise is very enteresting. I don't read books very much but this one I can say was really good. Hilton Als put a lot of details into the book an made people want to read the book.The things that i like was how they told about his live when he was younger and how he used to get beat up all the time. then there was lyrics from his songs in the book to i relly like to read the lyrics that he had wrote. So if any one ever plans to read a book i recomend this one.
5,"Wonderfully written, engaging stories with depth","The stories in How we met are wonderfully written, engaging and with a surprising amount of depth. I also liked the insights that begin each chapter, which served as a guide for the stories. It's a fun and interesting read for just about everyone. I even had my teenage daughter read it!"
2,Watch already stopped after 3 weeks,I am most impressed with this watch however after having it for three weeks it has already stopped working? I need a new battery already? Not pleased....
4,Dat gangsta gutta muzik,"""Face Off II"" is 1 of P Troy's best CDs yet. if u haven't heard it u missin' out on a classic CD. It's undaground and dat's how it sounds P Troy neva cease to amaze me. If u a true P troy fan u gon luv this CD."
3,Stop trying to go commercial PT,"This album was way better than By any means necessary, but it was still not it. I think starting with Universal Soldier someone told him he had to be more commercial to sell records, but thats not it. All he has to do is be HIMSELF, like on We Ready and Face off part 1, it hurts me to see an stuggling artist like PT fighting to find a spot in the limelight. Maybe he should spit the Gospel, that'll be tight. I give it a 3***"
5,PT Still Got It!!,This is the best Pastor Troy album ever. Some people thinks that he has fallen off which he did but he still got it and this album proves that Pastor is and always be one of the greatest Atlanta rappers!!!!!!!
4,Pastor Troy flows over gritty beats,"This whole album is made for hard-core southern hip-hop fans, especially fans of the real masters of No Limit sound, Beats By the Pound/The Medicine Men. Contrary to album credits, ""Equipped..."" sampled ""Beef"" by Mac which was produced by Odell, not KLC.Face Off, Pt. II is a must-have for real underground rap fanatics. this is not for the casual collector."
5,One of the REALEST misunderstood Rappers from GA,"I feel that Pastor Troy is one of the most underrated rappers from GA. In all honesty, before Lil Jon and T.I. came out, it was Pastor Troy getting everyone crunk in clubs down here. He mixes a blend of crunk with a look at the right and wrong side of life. To me this new CD is the Best Pastor Troy CD to date. I hope he doesn't sell out like a few Southern artist's I know."
4,STFU and listen,"P. Troy is one of the most underated and overlooked rappers in the south, and like in many cases, one of the best, produces and writes all he does by himself, this is a excellent album with great beats and insightful lyrics, some might say he has gone commercial, which is partly true, and this might upset some of his HARDCORE fans, but for the rest of us, its a great buy, from a great"
3,Same Ol' Pastor,This ain't one of Pastor's best but it still rolls. I don't really have a favorite track. He got beats out the a** though and anyone with speakers in their car will definately feel that. 3 stars for the Down South Georgia Boy. One Love
1,Nomuthafukkingoddamtitle,"He's done,he fell off just like Master P,No Limit,Ruff Ryders all them,murder Inc.His first 2 albums were good,between 1999-2002 was Pastor Troys glory years and when he had the juice.All You sucka Ass N*ggaz get over it."
1,Loud & Not Very Cool,"My wife and I were replacing two Panasonic Air Conditioners with two new Sharp Ones. We read that Sharp generally makes very good A/C's.Wow were we disappointed. This A/C was so loud and did not cool the room down as well as our older Panasonic A/C's. The fan was so load that we had to turn the machine off when eating dinner because we could not have a conversation. In the bedroom it was difficult to sleep with the A/C on because of the fan. The sound is like a hair drier.We returned these A/C's and purchased two from Amana, the only Manufacture we found who listed the noise level (50dB) on their product description. We found them are J&R; the only store we found who actually has the A/C's on display connected so you can hear them."
2,Efficient but loud,"Pros:Efficient air cooling, energy saving modes that work well, Energy Star with a rating of 10.8Cons:Loud and also makes a pinging sound when the water is dripping from the coils making it sound like its raining outside.I kept this unit because of it's energy efficiency and affordability.If quietness is a priority avoid this air conditioner."
2,dissapointed,a/c is very noisy and not very cold air coming out - I have other Sharp a/c's and they are terriffic - very dissappointed inthis one

5,Dreaming of Paradise,"I first saw this movie about 15 years ago when I was four. This was the most whimsical, magical, and enchanting cartoon I've ever seen. It's a classic in our houshold. I give this film 5 stars!"
2,"Nice, but color fades","I bought these 2 years ago. They look very nice, but after a year the color began to fade. They are pink now after two years of use. We even park in a garage, and I drive fairly little, so it doesn't seem to take much exposure for the color to fade."
1,Remastered by the deaf,The entrance of every song slides in making it sour notes. What idiot remastered this????
2,"Music, music, music","We enjoy this musician and we own cassettes. We were really glad to find this on CD's. Excellent item, good price, fast delivery."
4,great games,Lots of fun games to try. Haven't made it through all of them yet - but having fun anyway. Good way to have kids use old computer and play games on it.
3,"Good for basic knowledge, but needs updating for 607...","This package is good for acquiring the basics of routing and switching. However, the questions are unlike that of the actual exams, which are thought-provoking, and far from straight-forward. Some questions on the real exam are not covered in your package. Insofar as the package itself, the feedback popup is quite annoying, and the user needs to be able to edit the test in order to eliminate answering easy questions repetitively. Also, there are some errors in the material. I believe that an update with more ""real-life"" scenarios is in order. I believe this package was probably fine for the previous 507 exam, but I did not take that exam..."
3,Disappointing,This is a disappointing live set from the patriarch of the Texas musis scene. Night After Night lacks the spark of earlier live releases from Jerry. I would recommend both Live at Gruene Hall and Viva Luckenbach! over Night After Night.
1,Only if you enjoy listening to a live recording,"To my surprise this is a live recording rather than the orginal songs. For instance the ""London___Blues"" is not GP Nunn but JJ himself. Not all bad but certainly not what I expected."
3,Good solid live set,"This is a good solid recording of Jerry Jeff performing live. No song here is a ""definitive version"", but it still makes for an enjoyable listen. The audience sing-alongs give the feel of what a Jerry Jeff concert really is like. Overall, Jerry Jeff is a great performer, and this is his most realistic live album, being that it better encompasses how fun his shows are. A great souvenir for anyone who has seen him live within the past 5 years, because any given show is probably not too different from what you hear on the album. For those who have not yet seen him, this will give them a reason."
4,"Finally! The remake of his original ""Viva Terlingua"" Album","Jerry Jeff had some real problems with his previous record label. After years of being held hostage, he's finally re-recorded all of my favorites from the Viva Terlingua Album. I wore out that tape and am thrilled to have it on CD. Thanks Jerry Jeff! I'm glad to have your classic voice back in my collection."
4,"Good translation, poor quality paper",This translation of Daniil Kharms work seems to be pretty good and gets the point of the stories. I owe and have read the russian original. The book also covers rear published (and translated) exerts from his erotica. An important book for anybody interested in Russian culture and psychology. The only minus is the paper quality: feels like a newsprint.
2,The wrong CD,I really made a mistake in choosing this CD. The presentation was near perfect but I was looking for something more than just chanting.
1,"I'm reviewing the book, not the contents","These are some of the most delightful books for children ever written. Better than Lewis. Better than Milne. Better than Ransome. Long out of copyright, even by today's standards. Gather up her best in one book. Wonderful idea. Oh! Yes this is a great bargain. Unless.This is a paperback, not a hardback. And the type is very small. Very! But the two columns per page alleviates that somewhat. Only somewhat. But no illustrations. Just page after page of type; so, not as bad as a 1900 newspaper, but unappealing and unfriendly. I think the versions I read long ago had illustrations by Ernest Shepherd. Ohhhh, that is a loss....Think about this. Two small-print columns per page, no illustrations, a floppy paperback printed on what appears to be cheap paper. This is not for a child to read.I wish I had had a chance to see this in advance. Seek elsewhere for these treasures."
3,From the back cover,"Foolishly she'd never stopped loving him.Leon had swept the young and innocent Chloe into marriage, but there was no happy ending for them, for there would always be Marisa.Marisa, obsessive and possessive about her stepbrother, implied a relationship between them that could never be. She claimed a wife was only needed to diguise their sin.So Chloe, disgusted and confused, ran away.But a Greek's pride could not accept a wife's desertion, and he tricked her into returning. She hated and despised him - but could not deny she still wanted him..."
2,"Sour Fragrance, Too tart, poor taste","I tried 3 varieties of candied orange peel here on Amazon. These, the peels from Barry Farm, and also the Ultimate's Australian Glace Orange Peel.Of the 3 these were the bottom choice of the lot. The overall fragrance has a somewhat olive-like chemical odor and the taste is bitter. I wouldn't say it's a quality product.Taste wise the Ultimate's wins (if you don't mind the lack of a sealed package). A second choice would be the Barry Farm product which is quality and has a good taste to it."
1,worthless,"Whatever you are looking for in literature, this book isn't it. No drama, no action, no plot, no moral, certainly no erotica. Save your money."
1,"Sorry, folks, this is porn....","Look no further than the opening sentence: ""Gin took the slender shaft of the tube in her palm..."".This book is exploitative, sensationalistic, cheap, and shallow - and, yes, I've read it. There are no good intentions here, no deeper message. Don't fool yourselves. The author (and publisher) are out to make as much money as possible off the sexual fantasies of pre-teens.I think there is a lack of morality operating here that needs to be addressed. These things are wrong - and the more we accommodate and let the lines get pushed back, the more we are complicit in robbing young people of their childhoods. It seems like childhood has almost disappeared already. How very sad...."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"As a curious parent and Teacher I purchased this book. The Wall Street Journal made mention of this book earlier this summer. Prior to this I had never heard of Rainbow Parties. The best part of the book was the colorful cover. Apparently this may be a social issue in some areas.I am guessing this is a new author that will sell many books due to curiosity. But, save your money as it is not worth reading. The one thing that was good was the reference to AIDS on the back page. Again there are other books out there that young adults can read."
1,Not appropriate for children,This book is a dangerously misguided attempt to educate children about real risks. But I stress dangrously misguided. Please do not buy this book for your children.
1,Child Endangerment,"Anyone who gives this book to their child or children should be brought up on charges of child endangerment, child abuse, or both. And people wonder why our kids are the way they are???? Thanks to the authors of books like this, rap ""artists"", and ""role models"" like Brittany Spears, this is part of the reason why. The rest of the reason?? Some parents just can't be bothered. They are too busy being a buddy or a pal to their kids instead of a parent. And now you know why some people home-school their children. Too bad I had to give this a star."
1,pinestreet,Promotes oral sex as an acceptable behavior for children to engage in. Inappropriate reading material for children.
1,Porn for prepubescents,"Just what America needs - a book for ""young adults"" about a bunch of teenage skanks who are planning a group-sex party. As the father of two young daughters, I am horrified and appalled that this trash is being passed off as ""children's literature.""Yes, this is the same book that Michelle Malkin and Sean Hannity warned you about. Avoid it like the plague."
1,Seriously People,"For all those concerned, this book isn't going to give kids ideas where they don't already have them. Neither will it, as the author claims, initiate a dialogue that doesn't already exist. With all that said, this book is trash. Mostly because it really just isn't that good. There are many well-written books for adolesants that deal with sexuality in a tasteful way. This is not one of them. The writing is horribly juvenile and patronizing, the characterization is weak, and the plot flops. It's an insult to any young adult who knows how to read - they're quite capable of handling something that reads above a fifth grade level. Don't buy this book, it's a waste of paper."
1,Trash for Teens!,How this ever got into print is beyond me. Can't you find anything decent to write for children or are we just writing this generation off like the last one? This is one of the most disgusting books ever offered for sale. What ever happended to good literature for young people from the likes of G.A. Henty? I hope this book tanks!
5,Read it in middle school & enjoyed it,"Of course this book is not at all realistic, but it gives an interested view on homosexuals and sex in general. I really enjoyed this book when i read it in middle school. I thought it was interesting and pretty funny. It made me feel more comfortable talking about sex."
2,Not worth reading but very cute cover,"As an aunt of a gorgeous-almost-15-year-old girl, I wanted to read this to see if I'm sooo out of her generation - the answer would be ""no"" and truly, I could write a better book about peer pressure/sexual intimacy/transitioning from teenager to young adulthood. Basically you will learn two things from this book: 1) Yes my dear girls, even ""..just oral"" IS sex and 2) Yes, you CAN get a sexually transmitted disease from this. *Shocker*Save your money, if you really want to read it - borrow it from the library."
3,interesting cautionary tale,"It tears a bit like an extreme after school special. I think it would be interesting to discuss with older teens, but is a bit heavy handed with its message."
4,Good,OK READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU REVIEW IT1. this isnt a CHILDRENS book like so many of you say..what is wrong with you?2. you parents writing the review need to give your kids some space and let them read what the want..did u read the end of the book? i take it u didnt.but hey keep the negative reviews because the sales of this book are rising every day.
1,Sodomizing the minds of our children with Smut,"This book is about a group of kids who get together to have an ""Oral Sex"" party. Sounds like an enlightening piece of ""Juvenile Literature"" eh? Yeah, because the adults who we assume are responsible to keep such smut away from our children are indeed juveniles. Simon and Schuster need to grow up or move to the netherlands. Not here please."
1,Totally Inappropriate!,"I am both shocked and nauseated that this book has been published! The problem with the presumption that it will lead to good parent/teen conversations about this topic is that at least 90% of the time it won't happen. When my friends and I read ""Forever"" as young teens we hid it from our parents and never talked with them about the questions that it raised. We felt like everyone was doing ""it"", and since the book was written for us ""it"" must be OK. Nothing could have been farther from the truth. Yes, everyone was *talking* about it, but most were *not* doing it. However, several of my friends became sexually active shortly after reading that book. Even if *some* teens are doing these parties, it doesn't mean they all are. Books like this will cause it to become the norm and should never be published! It is a parent's responsibility to initiate conversations about sex - not a stranger who presents it in a book as ""the cool thing to do."""
4,Read the book before damning it!,"It seems that many of the reviewers here are complaining based on biased information given to them by outside sources. This book is about teens questioning their own moral values, and deciding whether or not they can afford to give in to peer pressure and attend this kind of party. This book is not just about glamorizing oral sex - far from it. Instead, the kids in the book realize there are very real consequences for engaging in this kind of promiscuous behavior.Kids are having oral sex. Period. I'd like to offer the opinion that ignoring the problem, rather than facing it and discussing it, is the truly irresponsible choice. If a parent doesn't approve of their child reading this book: don't buy it. Don't allow you child to check it out. But don't assume that the way you feel about this book is the way every one should react.Lastly: Read the book before you complain. Don't let media and general opinion tell you how to feel. Decide for yourself."
1,Can't believe this is targeted at teens,I wouldn't read this MYSELF - and certainly wouldn't let my teenager read this!
5,...an insight into the vital importance of...listening.,"As an introduction to the Tomatis method, Gilmour's work is both informative and enlightening. Written from direct experience and interviews with the French physician, Alfred Tomatis, the work is, basically, an insight into the vital importance of the auditory mechanism: listening.With major practical applications to the field of education, from prenatal life through elementary schooling, About the Tomatis Method is a rich source for educators. With further applications to the conscious use of music in everyday life, the book has encouraged many professionals in the field of music therapy, who use music as a tool to promote healing.It is this reviewer's hope that About the Tomatis Method will be reprinted and available in the near future. MEJ Spring, 1999"
5,A Grand Florida Adventure,"In Ten Thousand Islands, Randy White has captured the flavor of the south Florida and Gulf Coast while spinning a tale complete with adventure, intrigue, mystery, and a collection of colorful characters who will come to life in your mind. While reading this book , you will be on the Gulf Coast, in the Keys, chasing the bad guys, and marveling at the mysticism sprinked throughout. It's a mini vacation--a grand Florida Adventure."
2,hope ring,"the ring is ok. just ok. it's thinner silver than i thought it'd be, so it probably won't last forever. very shiny, but it'll dull down as i wear it. it took many many weeks to arrive and i contacted the seller more than 4 times w/ no response. i would never buy from this seller again."
4,The Book I Never Read,"This book is made for children from 9-12, and trust me i'm a eleven year old kid. This book is basically made from a fantasy and hilarious jokes. The strory goes like this that a boy named Conrad has to kill a certain person or he will die at the end of the year. So he travels with a smart kid who doesn't know a what a chili pepper is, to a castle to seek the person who he has to kill. Thats all i have read, but soon you will find on your own."
1,THIS IS PART 2,"This is PART 2, though you would not know that by is being indicated almost no where. Great i waited for a 40$ book which i cant use for my class or sell back. Amazon FTL."
5,Prompt delivery,The item arrived in the condition described and arrived in excellent time. I will definitely buy from this seller again.
5,good,glad i found this book because i got it for a lot cheaper than i would have been able to at the bookstore at school
5,I miss Inspector Gadget!,"This was one of my fav's as a child of the 80's. Arrived packaged nicely, and have zero complaints. It's nice to have around the house when you want to put a smile on your face. How I miss awesome cartoons! My 12 year old loves it too!"
3,Jung in a Nutshell,"The book gives a good view of who Jung is as a whole person and not in a good way. The book says little to Jung's accomplishments. It portrays him more as an antisemitic, cold hearted, opportunistic, manipulative, off balanced quack with little wisdom to offer of his own merit outside of knowledge gained from Freud. The book seems to mock him more than adore him. The book makes alot of interesting inferences into Jung's character. Often, the humor and cartoons are too obtuse. However, I guess that's about as entertaining as a book on Jung could really be."
4,Nice niche book on WW2,"Bought this for my father-in-law after he mentioned he was stationed in Schweinfurt in the '50's. Good mix as I also grew up hearing a lot about the mighty 8th at Barksdale AFB in Bossier City, LA."
1,The only thing you will lose reading this is your patience!,"This is a confusing, contradictory, disjointed book with a very limited list of low GI foods at the end of the book. The first ""red flag"" was in the preface when it said, ""This book has been written to be read alongside The Glucose Revolution, so in the event you haven't already consulted that book, please be sure to do so, for a more comprehensive discussion..."" On page 25 it states, ""Calorie-laden foods...such as alcohol, chocolate, potato chips and candy, provide few nutients.....they are best limited to no more than one or two servings per day."" On page 37 it states, ""Eat low carbohydrate foods such as carrots, broccoli and salads freely, but don't eat them instead of the high carbohydrate foods."" This book is very hard to follow. In my opinion, the book seems to be thrown together just to get it out on the market quickly.I am very disappointed in the Reader's Digest for recommending this book."
3,I LEARNED THE HARD WAY,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED. I did not remember that the ""HAPPY ORGAN"" was a rather irritating electronic organ. Yes, it was well performed music, but not for me. However, others may like this rather lazy style of organ music. I will keep it in my collection as a reminder that sometimes the picture doesn't have a thousand words, and assumption, well you know the rest."
1,Ridiculous price,"$9 for a bag of marshmallows? That's highway robbery. And it's an ""Addon"" item supposedly because its such a low price. This is a ripoff."
5,Great Intro to Russian Food!,"This book has many interesting stories in it that really give you an idea of what kind of life the author has lived. The food, especially the stroganoff is GREAT!! If you have never experienced Russian food, this is a good start. If you are well versed in Russian food, then you will know how good these are!"
1,DO NOT BUY this book.,"The recipes in the book have very little to do with Russian cuisine. They are gathered from different former Soviet Union Republics which are now different countries and not Russia by any means. Kharcho (page 73), Chicken Kiev (page 102), Gozinakh (page 142) and so on are not Russian dishes.Instructions in recipes are not broken down step by step. Not easy to follow.The tales in the book are translated from some other source but this source is not cited.The illustrations in Danishevsky's book are of extremely poor quality. They are well known pictures, however, there are no annotations about their authors or titles.At the same time of course it is written ""all rights reserved"" on the first page...Overly simplified table of contents which only lists food categories and not recipes. Few recipes overall in the book.DO NOT BUY this book."
1,THEY BREAK QUICK DON'T PURCHASE!,They don't even last a year. I have purchased them twice for my Mom and they stop working after 7 months. Don't purchase these phones!
1,What did you say??,I do not have a single phone call that does not include a complaint about the terrible voice quality of these handsets. I threw away the box thinking this was going to be a great product. Now I have three horrible handsets.
4,Great phones at a great price,"I did a lot of research on cordless phones before replacing my old junky VTech phones. I was looking for 2.4GHz phones due to the static that seems inherent in 5.8GHz phones. This is a nice set of phones for a ridiculously low price. The phones work great. Sound quality is generally excellent with no static. No problems so far.The only weakness is in the sound quality when the speakerphone feature is used. Speakerphone sound quality is decent, but not great - kind of flat-sounding. Still, the microphone works very well - the person on the other end of the line has no problem hearing me in speakerphone mode.For 60 bucks, I can't ask for a better set of phones."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this phone system based on the reviews I read, however when using these handsets, I'm told that I fade out and I often hear an echo. In addition, the handset on the base unit constantly goes ""out of range"" which requires unplugging the base from the electrical power, the phone jack, and removing the battery for a 1/2 hour. This is just not acceptable and I will be throwing these phones out as soon as I purchase new ones."
4,Like the phones,All 3 of the phones work great for me. I can hear well and they go a good distance from the house before getting staticy.
5,Humerous Look at a Serious Topic,I recently was diagnosed with cancer and have been very down. This book is funny and gives you a humerous way to look at the seriousness of cancer. Everytime I get stuck with an IV pole I think about this book and chuckle. When my hair fell out I thought of all the funny things the author had to say about her experience and I felt so much better. This is a fantastic book.
2,I'd rather do chemo than clean out the garage,I did not find as funny. It'e more about taking advanage of family and friends by chemo as a vehicle.
3,Not bad,"This one was a little more mean-spirited, making fun of people bringing food, using your treatment as an excuse to dodge work and indulge yourself, etc. I can imagine it being a lot more fulfilling to someone who's dealt with the side effects of the treatment. It was a bit depressing, but it finished up with some great solid advice on handling the treatment from a veteran."
4,Good humor when you really need it,I bought this for my sister so I did not read the whole thing but what I read I really liked. It is written with good humor and the words that I did read have really stayed with me. My sister (like me) would rather approach sickness with a sense of humor and some realistic advice and this book is good for that.
2,Didn't like this book either..,"Didn't like this book either.. It wasn't funny and anyone going through chemo only wish they could even feel like cleaning out the garage. My 16 year old is going through 3 horrible toxic chemos and she said she would Definitely rather clean out the garage rather than having to go through the chemo... it wasn't something entertaining enough to keep me reading, it was quite boring. If you want to laugh.. get Jeff Dunham's DVD, the newer one, it is sooo funny!! Search for him on YouTube.."
3,There is another good book for you,"IF you like this book- please check out-- Goddesses Don't buy Green Bananas. You can purchase directly from the website: goddessbook.com. The author donates many copies to cancer centers and families that are on the journey of cancer. It's a large book with many black and white portraits of women with cancer at different stages, different types and different ages. You'll love. it."
3,Purchase with caution,"I purchased this book for my mother, who is currently undergoing chemo treatments. Unfortunately, she had a very bad experience with her first cycle and is at a point where she sees nothing about chemo as humorous. After I received the book, I read through it and decided that it was not the right time to give my mom the book. In fact, she would much rather clean the garage than go through chemo. I had related a few of the insights to her, and she didn't appreciate any of them. As all caregivers know (now), each person has their own reaction to chemo - I believe my mom just wasn't at the right stage in her chemo to appreciate the intent of the book. I would suggest that persons purchasing the book seriously consider where the intended recipient is at emotionally in their treatment before passing it on."
5,Great book for loved ones undergoing chemotherapy,"This is a GREAT book to give to loved ones undergoing chemotherapy. It is funny and inspiring and not at all ""sappy"" like a lot of other cancer books on the market. The author has really found a positive way to look at a really difficult time in her life and I think her book will bring joy and laughter to a lot of people in similar situations."
2,The book title is too harsh,"I can understand the point of trying to bring smiles and laughter to a difficult situation. But the fact of the matter is that everyone one of us WOULD RATHER clean out the garage instead of doing chemo. I wish the title was different and then this book could be given as a as a ""pick-me-up"" gift to someone who is going through cancer treatment. BUT with the title as it is and some of the strong sarcastic comments in the book, it leaves you feeling uneasy about passing this book along to someone going through a life or death situation."
4,A Good Start,"This book was not side-splitting funny but there was at least one place where I laughed out loud. I read it when a loved one's battle with cancer was becoming overwhelming. I bought the book for him and suggested he read it but I doubt he has picked it up.I think women will be able to relate to this book more that men because the author is fighting breast cancer and she tells humorous stories about dealing with her appearance, such as wigs, keeping her figure, and playing tennis with her ""IV"".The message of the book is very good and the advice about staying positive and energizing oneself with laughter is right on."
5,a beautiful recording,"""orfeo and euridice"" is such a lovely opera, filled withdelightful melodies. This recording is one of the best.Dawn upshaw is the euridice of my dreams, Alison hagleyis a sweet and charming amor. I'm not a fan of Larmore's voice, but she is a fine Orfeo.The orchestra playing is light and charming, and thesound is very good as one would expect of a modern recording."
5,American Pin-Up Illustrator,"Wonderful book filled with the amazingly beautiful pin up illustrations of the American artist, Rolf Armstrong. Great addition to any collector's library. Fashion illustrators and graphic artists will also love this book."
3,Needs improvement,"I was lucky enough to be taught by the professor himself--Dr. Patt. The book needs definite improvement in clarity. Too many of the concepts are abstract and ambiguous. The exercises at the end of each section are pathetic, they should be presented more in a Mathematical or Physics style and they do not flex your knowledge about what you have learned in that section. I had to rely on my TAs to explain certain concepts to me since the book did such a poor job.However, once you master everything that this book has to offer (I strongly recommend you read the appendixes at the end of the book as collateral reading) you will truly understand how computers work at the most fundamental level."
3,needs improvement.,"I agree that the first part of the book is great but there are few chapters in the ""C and beyond"" that are of the same caliber as the first part. The only chapters worth reading closely in that section are the chapters about the function call stack and recursion. Kernighan and Ritchie 2nd edition is a much better choice for people familiar with programming. There are also numerous introductory C books like Deitel, Beginning with C by Ron House, etc."
4,"Well written, not enough LC3 coding","I had to have this book for a computer organization and architecture class. The teacher sucked so this book had to be the main source of my study material. Homework questions are helpful, Would have liked if there was more applications of assembly language."
2,Not the Best Brandenberg,"Save your money. Il Giardino breaks no new ground here and instead gives a rushed performance more reminiscent of something from a provincial opera company than an accomplished ensemble. The Corn is blares unexpectedly while the dynamics are all over the place. The audio quality may be good, but the music sounds so bad; especially the harpsichord which has an unpleasantly metallic timbre.If you want a great new recording, get either the Tafelmusik recording under the direction of Jeanne Lamon (which has the best Concerto No. 5 around), or Jordi Savall's recording directing Le Concert des Nations/La Capella Real de Catalunya. Both of those recordings far outshine this one and make it sound like the work of amateurs."
2,I don't get the glowing reviews at all,"I bought this set thinking it would rock the sometimes-too-sedate world of recorded Brandenburgs. I had read good things about their performances of Vivaldi classics, so naturally I was intrigued. Well, what a disappointment. This performance hardly ""rocks"" at all. (If that's the best word.) It sounded a bit soulless. The slow movements didn't move me. The actual recording is first-rate, though, and for period instruments it's nice. But the playing is just not that inspired. I couldn't tell where I was a few times; which concerto I was listening to. Maybe that was just me putting my attention elsewhere, like, ""when am I going to find a hot recording of the beloved Brandenburgs?"" Perhaps I'm having a bad day, but I doubt it."
2,I love to hate them,"I own many disk of IGA including this, I've heard them in concert and even assist to a rehearsal. I would like to say that the way they make music doesn't have anything to do with authenticity. The strings players have a mostly modern tecnique, (most of them use chinrest and endpins). I would like to point out that the art from 1700 is not ugly as a whole or in its parts (look at paintings or architecture). Yes they do make ugly sounds and they do have very poor taste."
4,Bilingual Fun for Beginners,Que suerte! What luck! We are so glad we came across this book and the others in Gladys Rosa-Mendoza's series. The author does a nice job of introducing basic English and Spanish vocabulary words in an interesting way. My son enjoys listening and looking at the colorful drawings and trying to repeat the words. All in all it's a nice addition to our children's bilingual collection. Gracias Amazon for providing these great teaching tools!!!!
3,Good size but not really great,"So... Go with the Oster, way better. It's nice that it comes with a handle but the spacing of the tongs and the material of the tongs hurts the dog more than gets out snags."
5,Outstanding Book on WW2 Tank Warfare in the Pacific,"This superb book gives exciting descriptions of tank battles fought by Marines during WW2. Since both the American and Japanese used tanks in an infantry support role, most battles were fought with small groups of tanks. The book describes the battles in which tanks were used in support of infantry. This includes use of Japanese tanks in support of their infantry against the US troops. The book also details the few, brief tank vs. tank battles between the US Marines and the Japanese. The author does an excellent job describing the overall battle of each island, the roll of the American and Japanese tanks in them., and first hand accounts of small actions. The book also includes about 100 photographs which provide a good idea what much of the terrain and combat were like. This is a must have for anyone interested in armored warfare or the WW2 war in the Pacific. I only wish I could find a comparable book on the US army tank battles in the Pacific."
3,Confirm the publisher before buying,"As a retired Marine officer, amateur historian and former newsman, I can say Gilbert is a knowledgeable and facile writer. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Marine Tank Battles in Korea."" Gilbert knows how to write popular history, and he gets it right. This volume reads beautifully, however the half-tones are the pits. The original version of this volume was published by Combined Publishing on quality paper with excellent photo reproduction. The volume I received from Amazon was not the Combined Publishing edition, but one by DaCapo Press. It looks like a photocopy of the original done overseas. Most of the pictures are muddy and indecipherable. Useless as a modeling reference, but great reading.BF Halloran"
5,Marine Tank Battles in the pacific; A REVIEW,"As a former U.S. Army Tanker in the late 1960s I could empathize with the tankers daily routine of movement and maintenance. The long underpaid overworked hours one puts in as a track-head. Being couped up, nearly blind in a turret wondering what was going on outside of one' pony. I was truly amazed at the bravery and dedication of the WWII Marine Corp. Tankers, the appalling carnage they witnessed and the pathos of combat. The author brought all this and more to life in his writing. At times I got sick from the bloody battles they and the infantry fought in the Pacific Theater. Having served in the far east I can imagine easily the mental and physical toll the heat, humidity and insects took on one's mind and body. I feel that the political leaders of this county should read this before committing us to war."
3,Marine Tank Battles in the Pacific,"This is an excellent read that has been well researched with great accounts by the battle participants. However, the Da Capo edition is of extremely poor quality. The photos provided to supplement the stories and provide a visual understanding of the conditions that confronted the tankers are worse than bad photo copies.

Let me emphasize--the book is superb, the Da Capo published version is terrible."
