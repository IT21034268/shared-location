1,Worst cordless phone ever!,I have owned many cordless phones in my life and this one is the worssssst! It is not user friendly at all. I also found myself hearing a double conversation of what I was saying even after changing the channel several time which by the way was a feat in itself! I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this model of Uniden phone. I have since replaced it with another phone by Uniden!
5,Wonderful Chanukah Music,"I'm not Jewish, but I really like this CD. Most of the music is light and helps us all get ready for the holiday season. I think Jews and non-Jews with a sense of humor would enjoy this one."
3,Large Bone,"The Nylabone descriptions in Amazon leave alot to be desired; most don't indicate the size of the bone. I wanted a hybrid hard/soft bone appropriate for my 60lb Golden Retriever. Some of the reviews I read indicated that the nylabone product they received was too small for their dog, so I searched hard for a bone that was large. This bone (model NTG705P) is a little to big and heavy for my dog. She chews on it, but it is difficult for her to pick up, and it drops with a loud crack."
3,bummer,Thought this would be great for my puppy who likes to chew. She just isn't interested. But it seems sturdy and well made. Heavier than what I had imagined. Putting it away for now and will revisit down the road.
5,Cleans teeth extremely well,"I always get compliments on how white my dog's teeth are, and it also helps his breath! He likes the taste (bacon) but I like the smell (mint). He spends lots of time chewing on the Nylon ends, which turn into bristles and scrape the teeth clean, but when we play tug of war he digs into the rubber section. The rubber section has rubber teeth that clean his teeth with every bite. An awesome and durable toy. Only con I can think of is how sharp and pointy the edges become, makes it hard to play tug of war with a strong dog, but its worth it since his teeth are kept clean!"
3,Durable but boring.,"This was in the squeaker category, but it doesn't squeak! How annoying. It seems durable and sturdy, but my dog chewed on it for about 5 seconds and got bored with it so now it's just sitting in the middle of the floor where she likes to leave her boring toys. If I move it to the side she will sure enough bring it back to the middle of the floor to show her intense displeasure.If your pups just like mindless destructive chewing with no reward, such as mental stimulation or flavor, then give it a try. Otherwise, skip this one. Nylabone has better products."
2,meh...,"bought it as a gag gift. we all had a good laugh, because a snippet from one of the songs was a running joke between us. the album as a whole is a good dose of mediocrity."
1,a nightmare,"Round 1: The package came with NO manufacturer documentation, and a ""universal adapter"" that didnt even adapt to the headphones it came with. I took up Amazon on their return policy, and ordered a replacement.Round 2: This package had less in it than the first one. No documentation, no adapter, nothing. I spent $8 buying an adapter only to find out that the headphones didn't work. I was happily listening to music while walking around the house when a screaming loud blast of white noise almost knocked me over. I hadn't returned the first set yet, so i tried switching out the base units. Same thing. Repeatedly. I tried switching channels, changing the location of the base unit, and an impromptu prayer session.My advice: leave this page before you are tempted to buy one of these headphones. They arent worth $10, let alone what they are listed at. For myself, I will never buy a product from Sennheiser again."
2,Painful,"Speaking personally, I like to listen to music while I work and I can only wear these for about an hour or two before they make my ears hurt and give me a headache. Also, two AAA batteries only last me about a week before I start to notice the sound getting considerably fuzzier and quieter. And this may be an environmental thing but sometimes there is a constant hum in the background no matter how much I mess with the tuning. The sound quality is fine and wireless is nice, but if you plan to use your headphones heavily (and are prone to getting migranes) I would warn against buying these."
4,"Great price, nice sound, no manual","I was a bit hesitate while ordering the headphones, after reading some negative reviews. However, I am more than happy to write the review now, since I really enjoy the fun it provides: outstanding sound quality for the price, good range, easy to use, nicely fit...Cons: no document at all, though easy to figure out how it works."
4,Pretty comfortable.. Pretty good,"I liked them when I wanted to blast sound at night from the TV without waking the dead, but the high end is a tad lacking... Dialing in the correct frequency is usually easy, but keep dialing until you get STEREO.. Sometimes, you'll get a clean sound, but it is mono. Nudge it a bit, and you get stereo. My son uses them now to play PS3. I am glad I don't have to hear the machine guns, etc in Call of Duty.. I think I got these for under 50, and that is about the right price..."
1,Bad Bad Bad Service,I order this item and All I get is an empty box.. Would think about before ordering from Amazon.
2,Can't hear clearly for long,"I took this for my office use, the distance was not even more than 5 feet, still I have to return this because sound qality was very bad. I didn't like this. Good that Amazon returned it without any shipping charge.I used to get lots of noice even after doing enough tunning. Once the tunning happen, one can't move his/her head for an inch, if you move, you will get noice.Not at all good for listening songs. I will give a try for sharper image headphone, costs around $70-$80. I listen at my friend's place, sound quality was good and also the range."
1,Themes change - Kids wont get it.,I bought this for my 3 year old and its just an awful book in terms of content. The illustrations are great. BUT - it starts out with a sorry looking cat that has a hard time making friends because of his odor. You expect that Dr. Frankenstien would sympathize with his cat. DR. F further supplants the cat's loneliness with sheer terror and fright when it finds out that Dr. F makes a Dog to harass the pitiful cat.
1,Typical of the time,"The belief that Lindbergh killed his own son is unfortunately the prevalent one in America. That's sad, because that accusation never reached the mainstream until many years after Lindbergh's death, and that those accusations were nursed and spread by people (I won't say who) who had, and have, good reason to hate Lindbergh and would have, and do have, a vested interest in getting others to hate him. Apparently, they have succeeded."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This is a stupid book, written by people who lack the education, background, motivation, and writing skills to convince anyone who doesn't sit around all day watching talk shows or reading tabloids that their theory is plausible. They have an interesting theory but can't back it up. Sorry.By the way, looking at their personal photos on the back cover just makes me want to slap both of them."
1,What about the Ransom Money?,"I would like to know how this book explains away the ransom money found in Hauptman's garage; the piece of the kidnapping ladder matched to a piece of wood in the Hauptman home attic; the fact that Hauptman passed one of the ransom bills to a gas station owner, who wrote down his license plate thus insuring his capture; and the many other pieces of evidence that link Hauptman to the crime. I wouldn't purchase a book that accuses and thus publicly defames a father of murdering his own son, with no proof (according to reviews here.) I am amazed anyone would be willing to accept this theory without proof.I had a friend who had been very close to a very famous person, and he used to say, ""It takes no courage to defame the dead."" Charles Lindbergh had many faults, but he is not here to defend himself, although I suspect he wouldn't lower himself to refute a criminal accusation like this one."
1,Don't bother,The premise of this book is increduluous. The index is of little use; some very important people are completely missing. There are plenty of other good books on this topic.
5,FamousÂ¿Infamous,"The national reputation of Charles A. Lindbergh Jr.--""The Lone Eagle""--was of close-to-heroic proportions. But off-duty professional snoops Ahlgren and Monier scratched below the glossy surface (as would today's F.B.I. profilers) and found a warped personality. They have put together a convincing argument (circumstantial, just like the ""official"" one) that Lindbergh himself, in a practical joke gone horribly wrong, accidentally dropped the baby and buried him in a shallow grave nearby. Especially unconscionable was his waiting till Hauptman fried before leaving the country. Hauptman's only crime was in trying to claim the ransome money--but he was the only one of the hundreds who sought it to be burned for ""murder.""Justice in the 30s was much different than today's, but the public hysteria over the famous is much the same.The book could have used a professional copy editor/proofreader."
1,Very Poor,"I've never been so dissapointed in a Lindbergh kidnapping theory. Just plain badly done, omitting all crucial facts that would lead toward a different conclusion. ""Unprofesional"" as a description would be an understatement for this ""book."" Very dissapointing."
2,"a labored work, that stretches much","I was prompted to read this book after finishing A. Scott Berg's LINDBERG. I thought that it would complete the total picture of the events, to balance the family-authorized version of Mr Berg. What I found was a labored, poorly written and poorly organized version of the Lindberg kidnapping. There is no question that there are many disturbing accusations by the authors, that are probably true.The book could have been half the length and written in a more concise fashion. Many of the questions raised are as one-sided as the total blind defense of Mr Lindberg."
5,Clear treatment of the evidence,"I have no idea why so many readers found this book so bad. Okay, the prose isn't Shakespeare, but it does a better job explaining what the facts in the case mean than other Lindbergh books I've seen. I'd like them to discuss other theories -- they don't mention Elizabeth Morrow but in passing -- but it's the most plausible explanation I've seen so far."
2,Ho Hum,"nothing to say really other than this is a scattered volume of non information like ive ive never seen on this subject. youd be better off reading even Jafsies book. i dont hate it , like i do the state police whitewash book The Lindbergh Case by Jim Fisher (a must read if you love fiction) , but theres just no meat. its all potatoes."
1,Completely ridiculous!,"I am shocked beyond belief at the lengths some people will go to in order to make a buck. To imply that Charles Lindbergh, a man of high character, would accidently kill his own son and then concoct a kidnapping lie to cover it up is just ridiculous. Perhaps the author should take up more fiction writing!"
4,The Most Satisfying Treatment of the Subject,"I've read about half a dozen books on the ""kidnapping"" and this one answers more of my questions than any of the others. It just makes sense!I met Anna Hauptmann and I wish she had lived long enough to appreciate the evidence revealed in this book. It not only exonerates her husband, but points the finger of guilt where it belongs. I also disagree that the book is poorly written! It kept my attention from start to finish. I would have liked having a map of the Hopewell grounds, however."
1,"Tedious, Uninteresting","One gets so distracted by the bad writing it is hard to take the research seriously. Even if there was some iota of possibility to their conclusions it is hard to put much consideration to it accept in lurid fantasy. A waste of time, really. Sorry."
2,"Interesting hypothesis, but falls short","This book is an interesting read, but there is ABSOLUTELY no evidence to support their conclusion. This book belongs to the category ""if we can't solve the crime, the parents did it"".In addition, the book is repetitive and touches on a very small fraction of the evidence, in a very superficial way.I came away with the conclusion that the authors had an original idea, but were extremely lazy in developing it. Because there is no evidence to support their theory, it is nothing more than slander...but, then, the dead can't sue."
1,Suitable for Amateur Over Active Imaginations,"An interestingly pathetic investigation and conclusion, poorly written ""Heraldoesque"" for those of our fellow Americans who fanaticaly digest any conspiracy idea that comes plodding along - and they will continue to spring forth from the strange lunacy inherent in our obsession for a ""good"" story line. Don't waste your money and time on this one. Any serious investigator of the Lindbergh Kidnapping Case will conclude that it was very poorly done; so super glaring are some of the ommisions of evidence that you get the sense that these authors are fanatics - nothing more."
1,do not buy this variety pack,"i have been buying Stoneridge Orchards products for a long time, so i decided to try the variety pack for quick snacks. not only the product seems inferior to their regular packages, but also, the pouches were half open in the box. what a rip off"
1,"high fructose corn syrup, need i say more?","this product is laced with high fructose corn syrup as well as many other preservatives and chemicals... i was not aware that fruit naturally contained these ingredients! why is it virtually impossible to find a dried fruit product other than raisins that is chemical free and does not contain unhealthy sweeteners in it? personally i would recommend the freeze dried fruit--if you live in a humid climate it is a bit frustrating as the fruit gets soggy, but in a dry climate it is great."
1,Don't be fooled this isn't ALL NATURAL,"While you could do a lot worse with other snacks, much of the health benefit of eating ""fruit"" in this product are outweighed by the chemical additives. High Fructose Corn Syrup and Dextrose are in many, many grocery products, but they are not ""Natural"" as this manufacturer claims. Both are chemicals manufactured in labs and are not easily digested by the body. HFC as it is called, has been linked in high quantities to escalating the onset of diabetes.I have not tried this product, so I can't comment on the taste. I would like to try a dried fruit product, one which is truly natural and not laden with chemical additives."
1,Don Quijote Animated Tale - Do Not Purchase!,"I bought this DVD for my elementary Spanish students as a final and fun activity to culminate the stories they read. This video is nothing like the book. The only scene I was able to salvage was the windmill scene (4 minutes long), and even that was changed.I'm glad that this only cost me a few dollars. I would not recommend this video to any Spanish teacher looking for a cartoon version of the book to show younger ones.Please be careful that the Spanish version DVD is the same as the English version, but translated. The covers are different, but they are the same storylines. The Spanish Cover has a supertitle that says ""Fables ClÃ¡sicos"" which made me believe it was a different producer from the Engish version.Finally, the video was boring and beyond my 3rd graders to follow, especially since they had read the actual stories and were expecting different events and characters."
3,Don Quixote,"I'm going to be honest; I never really liked the story of Don Quixote. My Spanish class had to do a unit on it, and my teacher showed a video tape (not a DVD) of this cartoon. I'm sure it wasn't at all like the story, but it did let us visualize a very complicated story in English (we're Spanish 1 students, how are we supposed to read this book in Spanish?). I got the DVD version for my teacher, and she was very excited. So, the product made me happy, but it's probably not what you're looking for."
5,!!Get JAZZY!!,"If you are interested in learning jazz from the bottom to the top, here's a good start! I've found it to be very helpful. The results I've gotten from working with it have been great!"
5,I have a life again!,"This is the greatest product! The inventor should get the nobel peace prize. It saved my sanity. Baby wants to be held all day and you need to cook, go shopping, whatever...this is the answer. Best of all, you can take baby out without worrying as much about germ carrying, over-friendly strangers touching your precious little one. Since baby is so close to you, strangers are less apt to touch.When the swing and the bouncer seat won't work to stop baby's crying (assuming she/he's not wet or hungry), this does! The only drawback is that baby has to be 8 lbs to use it. Some other carriers do not have this requirement. We couldn't wait. We tucked baby's arms inside and were careful.(Wish Baby Bijorn would have made a preemie version.)This is rated one of the safest carriers by consumer reports and by _Baby Bargains_ authors Denise and Alan Fields. It does feel secure. Expensive, but well worth it!!"
4,Great product,"This baby carrier is very sturdy. I was hesitant to use it at first, because my baby's head seemed to either flop around or her face seemed to be smushed into my chest. After watching the video on the company website on how to put it on properly, I was put at ease, and realize her face is *supposed* to be smushed into my chest, and that she didn't seem to mind as she was just lulled to sleep. I only gave this product 4 stars, however, because I want to see how it grows with her, i.e. when she can face out or ride on my back. For now though (0-3 months, 6-12 lbs) it is a great carrier and does not bother my back at all, even after hiking for 2+ hours with her."
3,Not for the weak,"My husband LOVES this carrier and would probably carry our 8 month around in it ALL THE TIME if I'd let him. Of course, he is 6'3"" and much stronger than I am. I have had trouble with this item from the get-go. The first time I used it,my daughter was around 3 or 4 months old and I could only carry her for about 20 minutes before my back & shoulders started to ache. I thought I was doing it wrong but after several re-adjustments and attempts, still couldn't get comfy in this. Now, our daughter seems to enjoy herself immensely when we are carrying her around so I guess that's what is most important, huh? Anyway, I still recommend this front carrier for all the babies out there, but I would like to put a word of caution out to the smaller framed parents proned to backaches..."
2,Hurts My Back,"I first got the Baby Bjorn 2 years ago when my son was born. The only problem I have with this carrier is the pain I get in my back and shoulders. I used thisfor a little while, but it really hurts my back. I decided to give it another try with my daughter who weighs 11 pounds. My back still hurts. One of the other reviews suggested moving the criss cross straps lower. Both of my babies like the carrier. It works well for when I want to calm my daughter, she will usually fall asleep It's great for the babies. I'm still looking for a better carrier and will also try to figure out how I can use this without being in pain."
4,"Works great, but baby didn't like it much","I didn't use this much because my baby cried most of the time when I put her in the carrier. I used it a few times when I had to push my mom in the wheelchair and carry my baby at the same time because I had no other alternative to carry my baby. She liked it a few times when she was a little older and could face outward. I really didn't find much use for it, though. Maybe our next baby will like it more. Our first was a little fussy in her first 5 months or so."
4,"Great product, although too pricy","This might be easily the best front carrier on the market. I've tried Infantino and Snugli with my first child and they weren't as comfortable, they don't even come close. This carrier also has the BEST and the SIMPLEST design. You can put the baby in and take him out in a snap, while other carriers have so many buckles and straps, you get confused how to even use them. I remember my Infantino carrier even came with a video cassette with explanations how to use it.The shoulder straps are wide and the criss-crossing on your back is fabulous, it allows you to place all the weight on your lower back and not on your shoulders. Don't miss the fact that it's 100% cotton and neither you nor your baby sweat in it. All around great product, the only downside is the price and that's why I give it 4 stars. They shouldn't make baby things you can only use for about 6 months so pricy. Oh, well, I bought it though, didn't I?:)Highly recomended."
5,well worth the money,"The best thing for a colicky baby! I'm now using this for my third baby & I use it so much-increasingly so with each child as my kids are so close together in age. I thought it was difficult to set up the first couple of times, but it was just because I wasn't used to it, now I can put it on in a flash. Apart from freeing your hands, it really settles the baby. Don't waste your money on a cheaper version, it's false economy!"
3,Good - but you can live without it,"THis is great for little tiny babies, but once my little one was 3 months old she was way too heavy for it."
2,"Nice product, BUT","it's very difficult to get anything done with the baby in front. I can't see the dishes to wash them, clothes to fold them or the floor to vacuum. I wish I had bought something that keeps baby to the side. It's great for walking if that's all you need to do."
2,Meh,"A little pricey for a carrier with little to no versatility. We used it perhaps 15-20 times in her first year. By the time she reached ~15 pounds, the pull on our shoulders was dreadful.I vastly prefer my MUCH less expensive slings and wraps for ease of use, comfort for both mother and baby, versatility and variety of carries, and proper ergonomic support for the baby's spine. For the price, get a wrap /and/ a sling instead, and still save a few bucks, and use them well into the third year!"
2,Am I the only one??!!,"I just bought this yesterday for my 5 week old baby girl. She is 8lbs. 9 oz. and 21 1/2"" long. She is over the min. req. wt. so she should fit in this, but she does not!When I set her in it and she faces my chest, her head will either lay to the right or the left. Unfortunatly, her face gets burried in the shoulder straps no matter how I adjust her or myelf.The only thing I can think of is maybe it is because I have a large chest. My chest kind of pushes her out a bit in her torso area and causes her to not be really able to lay flat against me. However, I doubt that I am the only large chested person in the world to own this so maybe mine is defective or something.I can see that when she gets a little bigger and can fill it out better then it may be just fine, but for now I don't think I can use it."
1,History of Back injuries -caution!,"I purchased this item based on the numerous reviews and placed it storage for my pending arrival. My girlfriend absolutely loves hers and I had the opportunity to use hers with one of her daughters. Unfortunately, I was only able to tolerated this carrier for less then 15 minutes before I started having pain in my low back and down my legs. I do have a history of prior back injuries and as a therapist I am aware of the additional strain placed on my back with a front carrier. I think the product has a useful design howeverI just do not think it is wise to use a front carrier if you have had a prior back injury. I will be looking for a carrier but one that is designed similar to a backpack."
2,I'd skip it and get something else,"This carrier would be much better if adjusted for different body types. There is very little slack for adjustment.Other than that it seems secure, but a little difficult to get the bady situated in.If I could go back I wouldn't have gotten this carrier. There are better and less expensive ones out there"
5,Don't wast your money on the cheaper carriers,I ordered a baby bjorn before my son was born last january. I had gone to a local baby store and tried out this carrier as well as the snugli and other cheaper ones. The baby bjorn was the only one I was able to put on without someone else helping. The snugli has a back clasp that gets hooked between your shoulder blades. It is nearly impossible to hook! Both my husband and I love carrying our son in the baby bjorn. We recently lent it to my husband's sister to use on her 3rd son. She already had a snugli but didn't like it. She too loves this carrier!
2,OK - I've found a better carrier!,"I got this carrier when I had my first baby. He was very heavy, as in a 25lb 1 year old. I am not a big person and when I used this, my back would be killing me. It was hot for him and his fat legs were weird in it. It also seemed uncomfortable that he was essentially hanging by his crotch. So I researched and found an Asian Baby Carrier for my second baby. Half the price, WAY more comfortable for him and me. We use it all the time and I can carry my now two year old with it as well as my 4 month old. You can sometimes get one on ebay, or use a search engine for an Asian Baby Carrier. Mine is a Kozy Carrier, but there are many. They are made by stay at home moms. They are also called Mei Tai's. I can't say enough good things about it. It's not a mainstream thing so you probably don't know anyone with one, but if you get one, all your friends will want one. Save your money, get an ABC, you will not be sorry!!!!!!!"
3,Harder to use with larger babies..,"I loved the Bjorn, although I was shocked by how much it hurt my back. That said, my baby was 9lbs at birth and grew into the 98th percentile almost right away so she's always been on the heavy side. For the first few months, I liked that I could carry her around with me while I did my chores, and when we went shopping. She'd usually fall asleep, so I also used the Bjorn when she was cranky and hard to soothe. It worked like a charm! Still, the first time I washed it, one of the straps frayed and came away badly, so I'm going to write to their USA distributor about this.I'd say this is great for the first four months of baby's life, but it's too hard on the back to use up to 25lbs."
2,Too expensive for how much it hurts your back,"I'm amazed that so many people give this item a good review. Both my husband and I are fit people with no history of back problems, but almost immediately this carrier hurt both of our backs. Our baby seems to enjoy it (both at the beginning and now that she's old enough to face outwards), but it's simply not worth the pain (or the money) in my opinion. While there may be no alternative for those early months, we have recently bought a backpack and have had MUCH better results. The backpack costs a few dollars more, but it is much more comfortable and we can use it a lot longer. If you can do without a front carrier for the first five months or so, do it - buy a backpack instead."
3,Not for big babies,Everyone raved about the Baby Bjorn. I bought one and have hardly used it. My son was born at 9 pounds and kept putting on weight. I just found it too heavy and hot to carry him around in this. I do think this would be great if you have a small baby born in the winter. If you have a late spring or summer baby you'll both burn up. There is a reason these are Swedish products!
5,What a life saver!,"This is one of the products that I am most thankful for! I recived my carrier as a gift but would have gladly spent the money for one! As a new mom it has helped me so much to have BOTH of my hands free. My 8 week old daughter loves it also, she is so comfortable in it that she always falls asleep. We take it shopping, on walks, everywhere! I was glad to find that it doesn't hurt my back. Try it and you'll love it too! Good luck to all the other first time parents!"
2,Consider these points before buying a carrier,"1. Carrier's made of black, thick material which was too hot for my infant (who's hot-natured). This resulted in a hot, cranky baby with lots of spit up. (and, combine the thick/heavy material with heat in the South...)2. The straps aren't long enough to make this comfortable for my husband (he's 6'4""). Even if you spend xtra $$ for the XL size it still didn't fit right. Head of baby still seemed to be right at my husband's nose.3. When on, you have to bend at the knees so the baby doesn't fall out if you try to lean forward to pick anything up. Having it right in front of you makes it difficult to lean to pick anything up if you're shopping. If baby is trying to sleep, leaning is out of question.4. Having this on you is just like being 9 mths pregnant again.5. While in the carrier, the 'fold down' part still didn't come low enough for baby to 'see' out when facing forward.6. I tried other less-expensive carriers with the same results."
1,Could be dangerous,"My infant son had to be taken to the ER after being placed in the Baby Bjorn. My baby is not a chubby baby, so his legs don't have an extraordinary amount of fat on them. His legs fit through the leg holes with a lot of room to spare. The circulation in his leg was cut off and his leg and foot became hard, cold and purple within 15 minutes, by the time I realized what had happened. It took 4 days for his leg to go back to normal color and I will NEVER use this carrier again."
5,The best baby carrier ever!,"Comfortable, safe, durable and hands-free. What more could you ask for?!"
5,Worth [$$$],Easiest carrier to use. My daughter falls asleep instantly when in it. I get laundry and housework done at the same time. She LOVES the closeness. She stares all over when she is in it.
1,"breastfeeding moms, beware!","unfortunately, this carrier only worked when i had just fed my daughter, otherwise, it was painful! it pressed her up against my chest. also, the weight limit is 34 lbs., but that is insane. by the time my daughter weighed 14 lbs (which was about 6 weeks old), she was way too heavy for me to put that weight on my shoulders. i have used my new native baby carrier sling instead, and she is now 18 lbs, and it's still great. it distributes the weight much better. i would not recommend this carrier unless your shoulders can handle alot of weight on them."
2,Buyer Beware - SIZE ISSUE,"We were delighted to receive this off of our registry, but entirely upset, when it was too small for either of us to wear. We are not grossly over weight, my husband is broad shouldered, but Standard means, Small or Medium, not Large or Extra Large. Now to make it usable we will have to buy an extra large strap for 54 dollars and change. So, make sure you know what you are buying when you sign up for this item."
3,One problem I have...,"Most everyone loves the Baby Bjorn, but I have one problem. The straps sit directly on my chest. As a nursing mom, this is uncomfortable, but it may be because I am a DD. My son does like it. I just wanted to point this out to large chested women because the carrier needs to be adjusted often for comfort."
4,great for small babies,"I love this carrier. My baby was 6lbs when he was born. This carrier worked for him from day 1. It has a high back that holds the head. He loves riding in it. When I can't get him to sleep, I just put him in and do chores. He falls right to sleep. The carrier keeps him snuggled against my chest and keeps him nice and toasty warm. the reason I only gave 4 stars is because of loading and unloading your baby. It isn't difficult, but it takes a little maneuvering. I love my Baby Bjorn carrier. It is definitely worth every penny!"
4,GREAT Product,"Very safe, sturdy, and easy to use. Easy to clean and works wonders with calming down a baby. But only worth the money if you use it regularly. My son had grown out of it by 5 months."
4,It's great if you've got the muscle,REALLY loved this product - but especially after pregnancy my back ached and the last thing I needed was more stress on my back. At first my baby was too small for the carrier - but she was exceptionally small - 5lbs 12 ozs - For a person with a healthy back - I would HIGHLY recommend this product
5,Best thing I bought,I used this constantly b/c my son was colicky and loved to be bounced in it next to my chest when he was about 2 months old and on. I couldn't have lived without this item. Great if you have a baby in the summer so you can go for walks without a stroller. They fall right asleep from the rocking! A little too small for my husband so make sure if you are sharing you consider a larger model too.
5,I love this carrier!!!,I love this carrier!! My daughter is 6 weeks old and I haven't been able to do ANYTHING around the house or get any Christmas shopping done because she always cries in her stroller and wants to be held. I decided to break down and buy a carrier even though I never used one with my previous two daughters. I thought about buying a cheaper one but after reading the review and seeing the quality in person I decided to breakdown and pay the 89.99 for it. Let me say it's the best purchase I've made so far!! Everytime I put her in it she falls fast asleep!
4,Pretty good for mommy; great for daddy.,"The black color is nice (goes with anything). The construction is very well made, very sturdy; definately better than all the other soft carriers. Nice for walks at the mall and the park; my boyfriend loves wearing our son in it. Not great for mom to wear around the house though. You cannot bend over or anything in it unless very vigilant and holding babys head. Forget doing housework in it. Really forget nursing with it on, no matter what Bjorn has to say about it. This is why I got a New Native Baby Sling. Babiesrus really should start carrying these. That way I can carry my son around safely while I shop, do housework, and I can nurse him in it at the same time, or carry him in back, plus later I can wear it on my side and he can ride on my hip."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT- A MUST HAVE!,i originally bought an evenflo less expensive baby carrier and hated it after the first few times of use. it was too tight- and i wasnt able to take my baby out when he fell asleep. i did some reading online and found that the baby bjorn was highly recommended. so we bought one and immediatly i could see why it was rated so high. it was a little intimidating for me at first trying to figure out how to use it- but after a few practice tries- i was able to do it in a snap. i could get my sleeping baby out of his carseat - into the carrier- do my grocery shopping and then put him back in his carseat - still sound asleep. I recommend this to all my friends- buy it- you will love it.
1,Who wants to hang from thier crotch?,"I just dont know why everyone loves this carrier so much! I have used this for about 4 months and dont really like it. When the baby is very small, he will be all scrunched up in it and when the baby gets much bigger, he will be too big to carry him comfortably. I am a strong person and am able to carry my baby with other carreirs for much longer periods of time. The Bjorn puts way too much pressure on your shoulders and back! I love carrying my baby, but not in this contraption! Who wants to hang from thier crotch? I wouldn't like it and I dont think you would either, so why make your baby? There are much much better carriers out there for less. Much more comfy for you and baby and cheaper too! Try the Sachi Carrier, the Kozy Carrier or a wrap, the Sachi and Kozy are so great! [...]are my favorites."
2,"Great, but don't waste your money","There are other child carriers out there that are almost EXACTLY like this one, for half or less than half the price. Don't buy into the hype!Also, the leg openings weren't made for chubby babies. If you do buy one, PLEASE check your child's legs often, as these can cut off circulation."
5,Much more secure,"I have bought a Snugli one and then received this one as a gift. I feel much more secure putting my daughter in it. Once you get the hang of putting the baby in it, it is great. Recommend it!"
3,"Great to have baby close, but major back pain!","Like most everyone else, I love this product. However, if you have a bad back or tight muscles in the neck and shoulders... try it out or shop around before laying down the money. After I wear the Bjorn for 15 minutes or so, I get a sharp bright pain in the curve of the neck/shoulder. Then I get dizzy and that's never good while holding your baby. So... try it before you buy it! But I have to admit that I get alot more housework done because of it!"
3,Nice but expensive,"This is a very nice carrier, but the cost is not equivilant to the amount it will be used. I only recommend it if you have money to burn. :o) My boys are 6 months old and 16 lbs (which is small for their age), and they are already too heavy to comfortably carry in the Bjorn, even though the weight limit is 25 lbs. After about 12 lbs, the straps start to dig into the shoulders and pull you forward.For the short time you can wear this, I would recommend something cheaper, like a Snugli or a sling. I can easily carry my son in a fabric sling with no pull on my back."
4,Love it!!!,"All I have to say about this product is it's GREAT!!!! Both of my hands are free to do whatever I need to do and at the same time I have my baby near me at all times. My husband even use it to carry our daughter against his chest while playing 18 holes of miniature golf....My daughter loved it(Mini-ME). Yes, too bad it can't hold a baby over 25lbs, But THANK GOD it doesn't or else I would have major back pains;-) It's a must for newborns."
5,My son loves this carrier!,My son is now 7 weeks and I have carried him in the baby bjorn since he was 3 weeks. He doesn't fuss when I put/pull him out of it. It is very comfortable on the back and most importantly it feeld sturdy and secure. My son can look up at me and I am able to see his cute little face at any instant. You must buy this carrier.
4,comfy,it so comfortable and easy to usei wish i bought it before my son turned 4 months. i had some problems with my other carrier. this is so much easier to put my baby in it.
4,Bjorn is on child #2,"I have used the carrier for both my children. My youngest is 10 months and I still use it to go on walks, playground, etc. It's also great for the airport. For those of you who don't get enough use out of it...make a point of bringing it in the car and use it instead of the stroller. My baby thinks it's heaps of fun being up high and kicking his feet. It also really helps to have my hands free to meet the demands of my 3 year old :)I think the newer model is a bit easier but I sometimes find the snaps on my 1999 model to be a bit challenging with a squirmy baby, other than that it's worth the $$."
4,Explore the outdoors......,"This item is wonderful for taking my baby outside for a walk. We have three dogs, and I need my hands free to walk the dogs, but I like for the baby to come along, too. This is a good solution. He gets to look at the world around him in the front facing position. I've used it several times to take him for a walk, and I've also worn it when my husband and I have gone to an art fair. My only reservation about this carrier is that the color is dark, and the fabric is thick. On hot summer days, I can't use it because it will overheat the baby. I wish that there were another option in a lighter color and a lightweight fabric for summer."
3,Good For short walks only!,"This carrier is convenient and easy to put on, but after walking five/six blocks carrying my 11 weeks old daughter in it, who weight 11 pounds, my back starts hurting. I do not see myself using this if she weight more than 14 pounds. The instructions said it reduce strain on your back, I think they meant only for twenty minutes. For the price It should reduce strain on your back for at least five hours. I used it in the house when my baby can't sleep or is having a fussy day, so that helps."
4,"a little pricey, but worth it.","We received this after registering for it for our baby shower, and used it occasionally with our daughter. She is now too big for it, so it didn't get enough use for the cost, though that was our fault since we usually forgot to take it with us when we traveled. It was a bit awkward to adjust initially, and getting used to strapping our daughter in took a while, but once in it, she was very comfortable, and enjoyed the closeness it provided.With our first daughter we had a much cheaper carrier, and the quality was no match for the Baby Bjorn...the extra cost is definately worth it to have a well-made, long lasting, comfortable baby carrier."
2,Hardly ever used it,"I can honestly count on one hand the number of times I have used the Baby Bjorn. I really only found it convenient when our baby was 1-2 months old and wanted to be held all the time. I would wear it around the house and do chores, but I still felt more comfortable just carrying her sometimes. I also didn't find it easy to get the poor little baby in the carrier with the straps, buckles, etc. I was nervous trying to get her in and out of it as she felt so unsupported when I had to hold her with one hand and unhook with the other."
3,Not for Large-breasted moms,"While this carrier is well made and has its good points, it is not very comfortable for women with large breasts. If you use it when the baby is still very young and your breasts are still tender from the influx of milk (esp if breastfeeding), the carrier can be downright painful. You can't tolerate the straps right over the top of you, and you can't yank your breasts off to the sides. Yeowch in either scenerio. Even when I could get resonably comfortable, the baby had a hard time riding facing forward. My chest pushed his upper body so far out, his head would be 3 or 4 inches away from me - he'd tip his head back and stare at the sky.If you're a gal D cup or above, get a sling instead. I found a sling to be much more comfortable, and after my son could sit up a bit and ride ""on the hip"" at 3 months, that was the way to go. A backpack is another option once they get older."
5,awesome,"I wish I bought this 4 years ago, when my first son was born! I bought it after my third ( I just could not justify spending so much for an infant carrier). I tried the Maya wrap, the Snugli carrier, and others, and this is the absolute best. So easy to use, and fits very well (I am a very petite woman, and I had no trouble with this being too long, or causing any back pain). Well worth the extra money, especially if you use it for more than one baby. Cleans up well in the washer."
3,Great for a small baby but not for a bigger one...,I loved this carrier up until my daughter got older and weighed about 15 pounds. Now I rarely use it because it is just pain for my back and shoulders and my daughter is only 18 pounds! I don't see how you could carry a 33 pound child in this. Buy this carrier if you only intend to use it for the first few months of your child's life.
3,Think before you leap!,"My husband instisted that we buy this. He only used it once.I am taller and larger than my husband so this is not something we could share without having to completely reset it each time.At the time of a new baby, there are many other ways we could have used that $90 more efficiently!Consider how you will use it, who will use it before you invest! If it is a good match for you, it is well made and has sturdy comfortable straps."
2,Good for newborns or small babies only,"I thought this product was great when my son was a newborn (born 9 pounds, 4 ounces) but by the time he was two months old this carrier couldn't handle the load. The other thing I didn't like was that it was not easy to put him into or take out of the carrier - he would scream and scream until I got him settled. If you have a smaller baby you could probably get a lot more use out of it, as I did enjoy it a great deal for those few weeks I was able to use it - but if you have a bigger baby I personally don't think it is worth the price."
3,It's not all that great!,"I like it. It's good to use when you go out and you have one of those babies that just can't be put down. You don't get any sore arms and your hands are free, but on the downside my back gets sore after about half an hour and you can't use it too much in warm weather because it makes baby hot. I think there may be a better carrier out there."
3,Needs practice,"This baby bjorn isn't bad. My husband needed to practice alot til he got the hang of it. After he got the hang of it, he loved it. I thought it was okay. Whenever I use it, it seems like I'm carrying alot of weight in front of me."
3,will you really use it?,"We bought the Baby Bjorn carrier (with the XL straps) because, as new parents, everyone said it was the thing to have and we didn't know any better. It is nice looking and seems extremely durable, but a bit tricky to get baby in and out of (and good luck if baby is asleep!!) and, in my view, not all that comfortable for nursing moms. My husband felt silly using it and it seemed a bit awkward for baby, so ours hardly got used at all. Bottom line: if you are going to use an infant carrier, this is probably a good one to have, but if you aren't sure whether you are infant carrier-types, trust your judgment and spend the dollars on a better stroller or whatever."
2,baby gets squished and overheated,"This is not a good carrier if you live in a warm climate. The material is too thick and the baby held too closely. My son never seemed comfortable in it. It was a tight fit for him and he was never over 50 percentile for weight. I would retry it every now and again and he always looked like he was so squished, it was hard for him to breathe."
5,Baby Item I Could Not Live Without!,"This is by far the best carrier on the market. Well worth the price. We got one for our first child and used it until he was 18 mos old. He (and I!) LOVED it! We used it for our 2nd child, until he was 20 mos old. It works great when you don't want to chase a toddler around the mall and he is tired of sitting in the stroller. I have NO complaints about carrying an older/heavier child. Very easy! My boys were about 23lbs by the time we stopped using it. I've worn it for several hours at a time (zoo, mall, museums, vacations, airports, ect) and walked around NYC for a week! It was a lifesaver!! I wore it around the house for light chores when my boys were tiny and needed to be close to mom at all times. It was awesome for my 2nd child, as I would just pop him in and have a hand free for my (then) 2 year old. We give the Bjorn as a gift to our close friends and family members because we had such wonderful success with it and it is worth spending the money on!!!!!"
5,love it!!,"My husband and I love the baby bjorn, we keep one in the ""family"" car so it's always there when we need it. It was a bit expensive and I have seen similar products such as Snugli on the market for much cheaper...no matter your budget, I highly recommened this product or at least something similar.However,this is of wonderful quality and I personaly, would rather spend the extra money and have something that may last through another baby if we get so lucky!"
1,Not a very much needed product after all....,"I was very excited when I bought this item for my 3 month old daughter. We are 6 months now, and maybe used it twice for about 5 minuts or so. It's much easier and more comfortable for the baby to stay in her portable car seat in case if we need to go to the store. Otherwise , the carrier is a little too tightly presses her against my body, I saw that it made her feel uncomfortable.After all, I didn't really need it , and the price is pretty stiff."
5,Very easy to wear and comfortable..,"When I bought this product, I was not sure about this high price. but I did already choose other products, but I did return because my boby didn't like it. so I choose this one evn if it was so pricy. alsolutely, I liked it. comfortable, easy to wear.. and my boby keep smiling with this carrier. perfect choice!!!!"
3,My son didn't like it,I thought this would be great for my husband and me to bond with our son but he just hated being confined from the day we brought him home.He prefers to be carried in our arms and being able to wiggle his legs. So- don't assume your baby will like it just because so many have....
3,Hard on the back,I love the idea of this carrier but boy does your back and shoulders suffer. After an hour of wearing this thing it is hard to stand and the next day you can feel it in all of your muscels. The active Bjorn carrier works much better and takes away a lot of that shoulder and back pressure.
4,Love it!,"I had a less expensive carrier with my 1st child and hated it. So, I decided to splurge and get this one. It's really comfortable, easy to use and my newborn seems very cozy in it. I'll be taking it on vacation with us even. I would highly recommend this!"
5,Believe me it is worth the money!!,Before I had the Baby Bjorn carrier I had a Graco Carrier which was horrible I returned it and researched all the other carriers on the market. My Sister-in-law told me the only safe and secure carrier is the Baby Bjorn Carrier. She was right!! I love it. My daughter was fully supported at age 2 months with the head in chest position and now at 7 months she faces forward and sits comfortably. My back feels very secure with the nice wide straps. You truly feel supported and secure. A great buy and would recommend to any new mom or mom to be!
5,THIS IS THE BEST!!!,"This carrier is AWESOME!!! Ever since a car accident last Mother's day (when I was 6 1/2 months pregnant) I have had back problems. This is the only carrier that has worked for me. I can wear it all day and my back feels fine. I can even take my sleeping son out of his car seat, strap him in and within a few minutes he is back asleep against me. My only regret was not buying it when my son was a newborn. I didn't purchase it until he was 7 months old (he only weighs 15 lbs at 8 months so I can still use it) because of the price - but someone else convinced me to buy it. It is definitely WELL WORTH IT. Now I know that I will be having another baby for sure! This is THE BEST front carrier!"
2,Didn't work for us,"Husband and I bought this carrier when our son was several weeks old, and it was a total waste of money. Ten minutes after being in the carier, our son's legs and feet were icy cold, because the hard straps cut out his circulation. Also in this carrier, all his weight was pressing against his crotch and he didn't like that. My back and shoulders were in pain. It didn't work for us at all. We started using Over the Shoulder Baby Holder sling, and after several awkward tries, we totally loved it."
4,life saver!,"i never thought that i'd have a colick baby, but I did. I thought I'd go crazy. Before we bought baby bjorn I had to carry him around ALL THE TIME! He wouldn't let me sleep, sit or eat. I was in tears myself from exaustion. WIth baby bjorn he's been snoozing 15 minutes after I put him in. I love that it's adjustable for any hight and length. I am a smaller person, but my husband can adjust the carrier to his hight and width just as well. Baby is very comfy and secure inside. I love that when he was smaller (born at 7lb), we could just use the snaps for his legs and he was very secure and injury-free. Other carriers that we've looked at do not offer anything even close to this.Now,at 2 1/2 month I still love this carrier! It's so easy to out him in and go on a walk and just as easy to take him out without waking him up. It was our life saver! buy it, is't worth of money. Don't waist your time (and money )on cheap stuff."
5,Worth every penny!,"This carrier is terrific! With my son I purchased a Snugli & never used it. It was uncomfortable & hard to use. With my daughter I decided to splurge & try the Baby Bjorn based on word of mouth. I am now the #1 fan! This carrier is very comfortable for both Mom & baby and is perfect for Moms on the go who need their hands free. I have used it grocery shopping, in the mall & in restaurants. It is simple to use, I can load my daughter in it one handed and is perfect for soothing baby when you're out and about. My daughter usually falls asleep in it. Believe the hype Baby Bjorn is worth the money."
1,Product Recall,"I think this product has been recalled. I've seen the recall in two separate locations - a magazine and the doctor's office. I'm not sure why it is still on the market, maybe the recall was for a previous release of the product but I would check into it before purchasing.I have an Evenflo Snugli baby carrier and I love it (so does my son, he falls asleep in it without fail) - plus it is MUCH less expensive than the Baby Bjorn (it retails for only $30). I would recommend this instead. I agree with the person who said to avoid the product altogether if you have back problems."
1,RECALL: U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission,I was about to purchase this product online after reading the wonderful reviews from other parents. However after researching this item for recalls I feel compelled to warn other parents about this recall and would like to encourage Baby Bjorn to fix this product defect as soon as possible.For more information please see:http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml04/04214.html
1,Dislike - dangerous,This was a baby shower gift. I used it once and returned it. I was very scared that my child would fall out of this and get hurt. It was very difficult to put him in and out of it. Not worth the money. Your child is very small for only a little while enjoy holding him and if you need to carry him put him in a stroller.
3,Depends on your baby,"My baby is colicky and has a very defined personality and she hates the Baby Bjorn. It's much too structured for her. She likes to put her hands around her face and keep her legs in different positions, which she can't do in the Baby Bjorn. I recommend a sling instead. (...) and my daughter has spent many hours in it. She can be in the position she likes and I can wander about the house doing whatever I want!"
5,Great for an infant that always wants to be held,"In the first few months with my baby, he ALWAYS needed to be danced with or walked with or rocked or anything to keep him in motion and close to a warm body. I was very happy to oblige, but I would never have been able to have a free hand if not for the baby bjorn. It's comfortable and baby loves it. Once he was two months old I started facing him out and he loves it even more. He can sleep in it while I'm wearing it too. He loves to go for walks facing out and seeing everything."
1,Not worth it,"I registered for this item and did get it. However, I used it only a couple times. When my son was a newborn, he cried a lot and wouldn't stay in the carrier and then he was too heavy to go in it. It is too expensive not to use."
4,Almost perfect,"I like the bjorn. The only reason I give it 4 stars, is that I wish you could nurse in it, like you can with some of the slings."
5,bjorn review,We bought this carrier for our first child and really love it. It is easy to use when you are alone and don't have an extra set of hands to help the child in and out of the carrier. It also is easy on your back. All parents should invest in this carrier.
5,Improved design,"I purchased a Bjorn 2 years ago. The old model was difficult to use. My son hated being placed in it, therefore I rarely used it. I received another Bjorn a a gift for my second child. I was impressed with the redesign. It is easy to place my baby in it. He lovesit. I use it instead of a stroller. It is great for grocery shopping, my 2 year old sits in the cart and I place the baby in the Bjorn."
4,Great for on the go!,"This is a great carrier! It's especially useful when I go shopping as the car seat takes up most of the basket if I try to use that. However, I bought it originally to use around the house to keep my baby happy while I do chores. All the up and down motion and the fact that baby sits right in front of you (To see what you are doing you end up doing most things sideways) really hinders most cleaning processes. So if housework is your intention, you might want to think twice."
5,Must Have!!!,"This is a must for any mom! I received the one that button's vs. snaps in and I would recommend you seek out the Bjorn that snaps. It is somewhat hard to button on your own. However, once the baby is in, it's amazing. When my baby weighed enough (8 lbs. is the minimum I think) we tried it immediately and she loved it. Now that she can hold her head, she loves to face outward while in the house or on walks. If we're on a walk and she gets sleepy, we just turn her around and she falls asleep. This is a must have for moms and dads!!!"
5,A Wonderfull bonding experience,"They have been the most amazing moments, those that I spent carrying my son in this carrier. I could take him everywhere, hold him close for long periods of time and share with him walks, arrends, his naps, etc. At the beginig he was looking inside and could sleep hearing my heart beat. When his neck was ready for it he was always facing forward looking at all the surroundings while you could hear his joy. I was confortable! and most important of all, happy, because I was enjoying it myself.Besides this, it's a great investment because you can use it for a long period of time. I started using it when my son was a month old and stoped around the 11th month because it started to be titght for him. Then I bought a back pack. I just love having my little kangoroo with me....But most important of all is that it allowed us to bond in a wonderfull way: by beeing together."
4,Would not have made it w/o my Baby Bjorn...,"The BB was one of the last items we purchased before the baby was born. I am 5'1"" and about 120lbs. Our baby was born at 8lbs and he has not stopped growing since. I used the BB from 1 month and I still use it occassionally. I do not use it as much now because our baby is 5 months and 20+ lbs, but my husband uses it all the time. This was truly one of the best investments we made. I use it for shopping, especially grocery shopping, doing things around the house and whereever else I need to. I let my mom, who has never known anything except strollers, try it and she loved it as well. She is also a petite woman. I do have to admit that now since our baby is bigger, I cannot carry him as long. Maybe about 2-3 hours now. It was worth the investment and it is durable enough that I know it will easily last through the next baby. Whenever that may be!"
5,I Couldn't Live Without This!!,"What a fantastic product this is! My daughter hated her stroller during her first several months. This carrier allowed me to get out of the house with her and we both enjoyed our outings. I would also carry her around the house with me while I did chores if whe was particularly fussy. It is so easy to use and extremely comfortable. I loved having her close to me. Within 5 minutes of putting her in, she would usually be passed right out. It was also terrific when her neck was strong enough to turn around and face outward. I could get around tight stores without struggling with a stroller and she could see everyting. My husband really enjoyed carrying her in this, he said it was a great bonding experience."
3,Not worth the money,"I think a Snuggly is just as good and half the price. This is expensive mainly because it is made of great fabric but it is not that important to pay double. It is also hard to figure out and not great for busty, short women like myself or big and tall men like my hubby. Best bet is to go to the store and try it on and see what you think in person. You may save money by checking other ones out."
2,Many errors keep this at about a two star book,I learned early on in the book there would be several errors and I was not disappointed. On top of that everything I read I knew inside and out and feel most fellow lovers of metal would feel 100% the same.
2,Metal from a woman's perspective...,"lauding the virtues of non-make up era Kiss, Motley Crue, and GNR while at the same time stomping on Priest and Maiden it isobvious Chuck Klosterman was formerly a woman. I applaud herfor writing about metal from a womans perspective."
1,why bother?,"I read this book over the course of a weekend. My interest in it stemmed from the fact that I am from the Fargo area. I did not read anything of relevance, period. Klosterman seems to be an immature, self-absorbed writer....he'd have been better off writing this drivel in his diary and sparing the rest of us from having to deal with it. The most appropriate thing about the book is that it is just like the city of Fargo, it is better to acknowledge that they exist than to have anything to do with them in person."
4,Pretty good,"I'll keep this one short and simple...if you feel the desire to read a Klosterman book...this is the one. I truly enjoyed this book. Although I am a bit older than Chuck I cold relate to his experiences and thoughts. Now, you want some good advice? Stay away from Eating The Dinosaur and Killing Yourself To Live...both are garbage, pure and simple, they're terrible. Dave in Mass"
4,I now feel alright about my cheese rock years.,"I liked Cocoa Puffs more than Fargo but both are very good. I disagreed with his takes on Rush being Christian rockers and Queensryche being just like Dream Theater, but it's hard for me to quibble with a guy who's so self-deprecating and makes me laugh out loud. His description of Poison on Page 63 is a highlight, as is three year hiatus on reviews for calling a particular cheesy album 'stellar.' I just ordered IV. The man can write."
5,Lived It and Loved It,"Klosterman is ON TARGET. If I was writing the story of glam metal in the 80s---it would look a lot like this. It is ironic that I was visiting store after store to find the new Faster Pussycat and LA Guns releases, so I could ""rock""---when I stumbled on this book (the store didn't have the albums by the way). The essence of what it was to be a hard-drinking, midwestern,suburban white teenage male in the 80s is captured in such vivid detail that I almost wonder if I've fallen into a time warp. ""So, come now Children of the Beast....Be strong..and SHOUT AT THE DEVIL!!!"" - Motley CrueToday, I have a ""normal"" job as a Financial Professional for a midwestern insurance company. And in my office, I have the following CDs that I play constantly: Motley Crue-Shout at the Devil, Faster Pussycat, LA Guns-Cocked & Loaded, Pretty Boy Floyd, Ratt-Out of the Cellar, etc. When I was listening to these as a teenager, I just ""knew"" I'd one day be a rock star, ya know?"
2,Someone gave a dork a book deal,"Klosterman knows a lot about '80s hair bands and metal, but who cares? He fails to connect this vapid musical movement to anything relevant. He's more interested in showing just how much he knows about Warrant, Poison, KISS, Guns n' Roses--he's set on showing off his metal trivia: what band members wore in each video, who replaced whom on guitar before the big record deal, cover art.Too bad. I wanted to like this book, and I read it cover-to-cover, but there's something about a dork who feels the need to spout metal trivia interjected with disingenuous self-effacement that reminds why I always changed the station when Ratt came on."
5,I love Chuck!,"I love this book! I also must say that I loved heavy metal when it ruled MTV. If you loved heavy metal, I think you have to read this book. If you didn't love heavy metal, then you may still enjoy the book, but I can't recommend it as highly. I think a lot of the jokes rely on knowledge of the music/metal culture, and if you didn't like metal you probably just won't care to read about Chuck's thoughts on it. Nevertheless, I think he has a gift for writing and this is my favorite book written by him. I swear that he is at least a little bit of heaven on earth."
1,Fargo Suck City,"I picked this up expecting a portrait of Klosterman's youth in rural ND and how it, and he, was affected by music--I was sorely disappointed. There is no odyssey, only Klosterman's opinions of the 80's metal scene (some interesting, some annoying, and some flat out dumb). Fine for anyone between the ages of 35-45 who actually obsessed over hair bands as much as he did, but if you were born after 1975 (I was) and aren't interested in a meaningless avalanche of names and dates (I'm not) don't bother reading."
2,mr klosterman's narrow mind and bad taste do not warrant book length treatment,"mr klosterman wonders why so much is made of the chapter titled ""i get drunk and go to a hockey game:"" an essay describing his penchant for alcohol abuse. well, sir; here's the deal: it's the only really fine piece of writing here. otherwise, the glories of having bad taste in music just do not carry a book. and then there's mr klosterman's narrow little mind. a very small place it seems, where ole' chucky loves to dictate how other people (especially people older and more talented than him) should carry on with their lives. this book simply adds up to one big drag. i don't know mr klosterman, never even seen him; but i predict divorce/failed relationships galore for the man. a narrow mind and poor thinking cannot equal success in that department of life. his book was overwhelmingly a waste of my time."
3,"Decent, But Glam Rock is Not Metal","This book is deceiving. It is NOT about metal, it is about glam rock, or hair metal (Motley Crue, Poison, Def Leppard etc.), which is NOT really metal. It is POP rock.Having said that, this book is still mildly entertaining. It is a pretty well told story of growing up in a really small town and listening to ROCK, and some metal, and not really fitting in. There are numerous humorous scenarios and it is an easy read.However, at times Klosterman can get VERY pedantic, especially when discussing his tastes in music. If he doesn't like a band, song, whatever, it automatically sucks, and is open for his harsh criticism. As a HUGE fan of Iron Maiden, it was very hard to sit and read him rip apart one of my favorite bands.Read for yourself, some will love, some will hate."
2,Interesting and funny but flawed...,"This is a funny and interesting book, but I had some very strong differences of opinion with the author. What kind of person likes bands like Poison and Cinderella but thinks bands like Judas Priest/Iron Maiden/Slayer and old Metallica are not worth listening to? Very strange. I guess maybe North Dakota is as warped as I've heard. Anyway, this is a good little book for nostalgia purposes if nothing else. The ""growing up"" stories are pretty funny, and the author's take on all those Gun's & Roses videos featuring dolphins is dead on. This guy was right to be frightened of the crowd at a Slayer concert: they'd eat him alive."
2,"Love Klosterman, but not this book","I'm a big fan of Chuck Klosterman's writing, so I thought I might enjoy Fargo Rock City even though I do not care about metal music in the least. But I only made it about halfway through the book before I had to give up. I assumed that this book would be as much about Klosterman and his teenage experiences as it is about metal, but I was wrong. This book is ONLY about metal. All 270 pages of it.And what I discovered is that Klosterman is a great writer when he is writing about characters, not when writing about concepts. That's what makes his novels Downtown Owl and The Visible Man so good--Klosterman can conjure up rich, fascinating characters in just a few pages. Sadly he cannot do the same for metal music.I would only recommend Fargo Rock City if you are/were in to metal music or if at least has some bearing on your formative years."
3,"Yeah, but is it metal?","Klosterman spends a good amount of time exploring what's ""heavy"", what's ""metal"", and what's ""heavy metal"" (all different things), but the title is a little misleading; he wasn't *really* a heavymetalhead. This book is more about hair ""metal"" and hard rock; pretty much the stuff that girls who DATED metalheads listened to back then.That aside, it's an enjoyable read and Klosterman's willingness to share embarassingly personal anecdotes really brings it to life."
3,"Fun, but includes a MAJOR error!","This book is a fun keepsake on a good time in music. HOWEVER, in Chuck's description of Poison's video ""Nothing But A Good Time"", he is actually describing the video for ""I Want Action""!!! It's hard to value Chuck's journalistic credibility with this major flub! If you read this, Chuck, I hope you'll acknowledge this grave mistake! Rock ON!!!"
4,Will he recognize her when he regains his eyesight .....,"Elinor knew it would be difficult to stay professional while nursing Jason Tenby back to health: he was used to calling the shots. Also, she couldn't forget the time when Jason had kissed her passionately...She'd never forgiven Jason for the trouble that had caused. But now Jason was injured and temporarily blind. For his sake, she must keep her identity a secret. However, as she healed him, she fell for him. All too soon he would be able to see her again -- the woman he'd once considered unsuitable for marriage!"
2,Call a spade a spade,"I really didn't understand the marketing of this book. Reading the book, I kept wondering ""where's the beef?"" I expected information that was useful but instead all I found was an autobiography that not only wasn't what I was looking for, it was boring."
1,This book was not helpful at all.,"This author may have a degree, but she advocates pornography as something liberating. Having a degree in Women Studies myself, I know that a majority of those women that are photographed are being sexually exploited. Some are threatened with a gun. Others resort to drugs and alcohol to lower the inhibitions. These women are runaways from incestuous homes. They are an easy target for the pimps and tricks. Advocating porn is like applauding sexual explotation of many women. If they freely would have chosen to work in the porn industry, they would not organize against it afterwards. She says the nudes she used to draw are not porn. To the contrary, they look like something that might appear in Hustler. Read ""Pornography: Men possessing women"" by Andrea Dworkin and decide for yourselves. She could have expressed her knowledge in less pages. Based on my experience, masturbation is very energy draining. It isn't sinful, but it might not be good for everybody."
1,Fairly obvious material with boring autobiography,"Maybe this was helpful 20 years ago, but as the author herself states in the foreward, masturbation is relatively accepted now. If you've masturbated before you probably don't need this. And if you hadn't you probably wouldn't want to read a book on it anyway. Author illustrates the book, and the pictures are pretty interesting. I swear that one of them is Lenin masturbating."
4,Engineering review,"While talking to the author about designing and marketing a medical device to assist women to exercise their pelvic floor muscles, Betty recommended that I buy this book to learn more about the anatomy and physiology of the female orgasm, and how the device I am designing might play a role. Betty writes from her three decades of experience teaching ""selflove"" to many women and some men. But it wasn't until page 157 that I found the relevant information. Betty was part of the early efforts in liberating women's thinking, and her stories of that effort are fascinating. She writes well, and makes her story interesting. I had hoped that there would be more clinical information that I could use for the product design; that is the only reason I subtracted one star. If you are expecting an instruction book, this isn't it. But if you want to learn about the emotional and sexual history of one pioneer of the sexual revolution, buy this book."
3,"Good, but not Great","This book is a good read on Ms Dodsons ""sexual awakening"" as it were, but one would expect there to be a lot more how to. If you are looking for a book with lots of masturbation techniques you are going to be disappointed. There is more info on her website than her book. Now don't get me wrong, I do not regret buying this book as I said it is a good read and it is a quick read and I suppose it would be helpful to those who are apprehensive about solo sex."
2,"Okay, but not what I was looking for.","It's an okay read, but it's not that helpful regarding orgasms and other practical advice in reaching the big O. Unless you have serious insecurities and negative thoughts about your body or have been abused, this book isn't really for you."
2,We like it. Updated Dec 2012,"Wireless / Wired option gave us more versatility. Integrated rain measurement feature is nice addition not found in comparable products. Only problem is when I ask what the weather station shows, my spouse still turns on the Weather Channel on TV!Update Dec 2012, experienced failures in rain gauge 3 times. Replacing with a Davis unit...after the snow and ice clear enough to access the roof safely."
3,LaCrosse Pro Weather Station,"I received the product with missing parts in the manufactures packaging, and they send the parts once I was able to contact them. I had to try 3 different times (methods), before they responded. The setup of the equipment including the computer is easy and operation is straightforward. I believe this product has been replaced with a newer model for 2008."
5,Great Buy,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife and she really likes it. It has all the features of a more expensive station and it was easy to setup and program. I have not yet used the PC interface yet, but will when I start fishing in the spring."
2,"When it works it,s good but it doesn't work often.","It was fine to start with but the list of failures is not impressive. Two new reed switches for the rain gauge required, each failed after a couple of months. Anemometer bearings failed indicating much reduced wind strength. Now several lines in the LCD have ceased to work. Not a happy relationship and to cap it off the local agent here in New Zealand was of no assistance what so ever."
3,Not Pure Classical,"The title of the album is misleading.It is mostly a fusion album, of course with classical elements.Not what I expected.I am not too big a fan of fusion so definitely not for me."
2,not reusable,"This gel holder is not really reusable.Actually, it is a very fragile item.There is a metal holder inside the gel that doesnt last more than a couple of days.Kids have fun and looks nice inside the box... but very poor quality manufacturing."
4,A must-have volume for GL fans,"I grew up on the Silver Age comics, including Green Lantern (Hal Jordan). If you know the characters, this is a must have volume in the ongoing saga. If you don't already know the characters, get to know them first with other books in the series -- but keep this one on your list for later!"
1,The Origin of Hal Jordan rewritten,"This book retells the origin of Hal Jordan, the GL of sector 2814. It focuses on Hal's personal life, and about how he grapples with becoming a GL with the ""most powerful weapon"" in the Universe. The book revolves around the interaction between Hal, his family and friends, and the Guardians. There is also a small hint on a plot device that was later used in Emerald Twilight. Overall, I would not recommend it unless you enjoy thinking about serious issues in life."
4,"Better than most other finger inserts, I say!","The overwhelming desire to misuse this item is nearly beyond description. You can insert almost anything into it: a Sephora chopstick, lint, you name it. I use mine instead of a money clip - I just wad my singles up into a tight little ball and wrap the Shear Rubber Finger Insert around 'em and I'm ready for a night on the town.And classy! Let me assure you - the envious looks you'll get when people notice your Rubber Finger Insert are well worth the two bucks you'll spend. Drop a handful into the pocket of your bib overalls and you can kiss the heckling of other farmers goodbye!The shear rubber finger insert: Kind of like a regular finger insert, but more rubbery."
3,"A decent potboiler, but does not follow the movie word-for-word","This novelization of the film ""Rainman"" (Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise) is a fairly good read, despite some objectionable product plugs between its pages.The novelization does not strictly follow the film's storyline and dialogue, so if you are expecting a script reference work, look elsewhere.The writing is not great writing-- there is imagery and insight, but not to a remarkable degree. There is a little story embellishment compared to the film, but not much.This is, however, a cleanly written and logically coherent potboiler-- far better than, for example, the abominable novelization of ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"". (There are three novelizations of ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"", from separate authors. At least one contains major plotpoint errors, spelling mistakes, and boring writing.)This review refers to the ISBN 0-451-16284-6395 edition of ""Rainman"" by Leonore Fleischer."
5,"Great for adding style to your dance, great for working out!","This video is both a great way to add style to your dancing as well as get a good workout. Perhaps the most difficult part of dancing is feeling the beat and adding a ""pulse"" to your dancing steps - this video will help you decide which steps go well with different paces of music as well as give you some style to show off.The first part of this video is a great workout or a great warmup for a dance class. The second part of this video is a bunch of great routine-style steps that will add flash and ""wow"" to your dancing. Expect to have people asking you how to do these steps after you show them off."
5,Boogie Blues Babe Belts 'em Out,"This is the first I ever heard of Deanna....where has she been? Boogie Piano raging, great voice, fresh songs, makes me want to dance all night long. Yeeeeaaaah! Listen to the samples. This woman is an artist."
5,Mary Did you know?,I ordered this cd for the Song Mary Did you know? It was the highlight of my holiday. I absolutely love this song. So the cd was awesome.
4,CafÃ© MÃ©liÃ¨s: Musique d'ambiance,"J'avais beaucoup entendu parlÃ© de la sortie de cette compilation si attendue. La majoritÃ© des chansons contiennent des paroles ce qui rend l'atmosphÃ¨re trÃ¨s dÃ©tendue compte tenue des petites notes chaudes de certaines piÃ¨ces. Excellent remix de Day by Day. Je vous le conseille fortement. Par contre, si vous vous attendez Ã  une ressemblance avec Saint-Germain, vous serez probablement dÃ©cu dans l'ensemble.."
5,great but no longer made product,"Purell really made a mistake in stop making the best instant sanitizing wipe using alcohol so it really sanitizes while also a great hand cleaner due to the soft absorbing cloth-like material. The replacement version are terrible. If you want these you need to order them while the stock may still be around. Like most great products, companies are always loking for ways to ""improve"" it, which means making it cheaper and not as good as the original. In this case Purell really hit the ball out of the park by taking a great product and replacing it with something that doesn't work and is terrible but way cheaper to make. Trouble is the public won't likely buy an inferior product very long. So buy this version while it lasts."
5,Excellent for travel,"Perfect for travel, these Purell hand wipes keep you clean on the go. Sturdier than the previous model. Came in handy on trips oversees, on NYC subway, etc."
4,Germs off!,"I have been using the Purell wipes a few years now, and it's very good to have especially when you have kids drive around everywhere. There are many product packaged as wipes, but not with antibacterial. I always stuff these in my bag, in the car, kid's backpack and lunch box.I don't have to worry about keeping/spreading germs around everywhere eventhough there are decent place to wash your hands thoroughly."
5,great example of good old rock and boogie!,"One of the few artist's that has a real feel for boogie and jive. Solid rock and roll, and a piano player that sure knows that a walking bass and boogie woogie piano moves the soul. Highly recommended"
2,"JOBST SUPPORT SOCKS - GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS","I have purchased many of these Jobst athletic support socks for my husband. The good news is that they really help alleviate the problems with varicose veins in his legs. He is retired, wearing them daily, and 'rotates' each pair every day. The tops are excellent, however the bad news is that the heel wears out quite quickly, making them very expensive relative to the wear-ability factor. I have had to cut out heels from other crew socks and insert them into the holes in the heels of the Jobst socks just to make them usable. He has at least twenty pairs and this issue seem to be a constant flaw in an other wise great product!"
5,jobst athletic socks,I have used these for years with never a complaint. Can bethe washed and put in the dryer with no problems.
2,Sub Par Performance,"I purchased this for a 2001 Buick Regal LS because the PO410 code light prevented my car from passing inspection. Replaced the unit, and within a week the code was back on. Garage advised to get a replacement. Due to timeline, had to pay for return and pay more for the new pump. Contacted customer service at the manufacturer (Dorman Products) and they weren't very helpful."
1,Noisy Pump - quality not there.,"Bought the Dorman pump thinking the quality was good but I was wrong. I received the pump and tested it before installing it; the pump was extremely noisy so I exchanged it. I received the second pump and this one is noisy too but not as much as the first one, so I decided to give it a chance and installed it. It works fine but it is noisy, now I have a noisy car.If you can afford to buy a good quality pump then don't bother with this one, you will not be happy. lots of room for improvement or the price shall be reduced significantly. I don't recommend the Dorman pump."
2,smog pumo,i bought this pump thinking i could save a couple of bucks vs buying oem partsi guess the old saying fits here. you get what you pay for.. the pump is loud and obnoxious.i thought it was the way i installed it. but i took it back out and ran it on my bench it was stillloud. i would not recommend this item...
4,The Breath of Life,"I am a great devotee of John Burroughs, one of the early naturalist writers. Most of his book concern his observations as he traveled around New England. Things were very different in the late nineteenth century. This book is very different. In this he attempts to.explain the difference between the living and non-living. ( not living and dead). It is not easy to read and understand on the first reading. Some of his ideas look a little strange after over 100 years, but are very worth reading and digesting.them."
1,Why??????,"I wonder why Mr. Ludlum can't call it a day instead of printing books like this one or ""Cry Of Halidon"" or ""Apoclaypse Watch"". He's not the same writer who gave us Bourne series and Rhinemann Exchange. I've been a great fan of Ludlum, but I can't just finish this book."
1,Garbage. Couldn't finish the book,"Mr. Ludlum wrote a real clunker here. Some of his previous books were notable -- even good. I struggled with this one, however, for weeks, falling asleep during each read. I finally gave up -- and actually was relieved when I did so. The dialogue was so bad and the plot -- well, a huuuugggggge stretch of the imagination and terribly contrived. Enough said --- save your money (and time) and skip this one."
1,This book makes me believe I could write a bestseller.,"To see the poor quality of this book just read a few lines from the forgettable husband and wife characters. Nobody talks like they do. If so, then I don't want to meet them. For a supposed accomplished author, I was unimpressed"
1,Read this book if you watch auto races just to see crashes,"Wow. Who edited this atrocity? Is Ludlum such a big name that no editor would dare question the hundreds of glaring problems in this stinker? Ludlum's insistence on advancing the plot through dialogue makes for some extremely painful reading. No one talks the way he constructs conversations. And the storyline, well, PU. A CIA operative, Army intelligence officer and MI-5 bigwig discussing the Matarese Circle with a bunch of teens? Wisecracks and one-upmanship as the world teeters on the brink of economic disaster? Did anyone else experience the frightening mental image of Hume Cronyn and Don Ameche, as the ancient wet-suit clad Beowolf and Togazzi, climbing aboard the boat--weapons at the ready--to capture the evil Cardinal Paravicini? As I read this book I couldn't help muttering to myself how bad it was. My wife told me to stop reading it, then. But I couldn't. It was so bad I had to slog to the finish. It is truly terrible."
2,The author seems to have lost his way again,"I have read all the previous books by Ludlum. After The Bourne trilogy, it seems like he has run out of characters as well as new plot situations.I hope this will be his last novel until he can again become the Ludlum we all read and couldn't wait for another book to be published.I found the story and dialog tiresome and boring."
1,I struggled through 100 pages & gave up,"I have read many books by this author but his recent efforts have left me cold. Rather than an exciting spy novel, this book reads like a political soapbox. The author spends all his time trying to convince the readers of the ""rightness"" of the heros views and filling us in on history as if we were idiots. The poor enemies are dispatched only after listening to the hero provide a 3 page recitation of their political views. This gets very tiring, especially after it repeats itself two or three times. From now on I will read the Amazon reader reviews prior to wasting good money on a bad book."
1,I'm Outta Here,"I'm up to page 200 now, and I finally quit...at the urging of my wife, who grew tired at how furious I became each night trying to slog through this wretched, wretched dross of a book. What a shame Bob has faded so. I have read all of Ludlum's books (save the ""Road"" comedies and the last half of the abominable ""Apocalypse Watch"") and he should be ashamed of himself. If you haven't before read Ludlum, try ANYTHING before 1993's Scorpio Illusion; books like the Bourne trilogy are masterpieces of the genre. As for me, I'll never buy another book by the man."
1,Glad to see it is not just me that can't get through this,"Thanks folks...I have been struggling, really struggling to finish. I think I have three chapters to go. But like somebody else out there in cyberspace, this book is a drag. Too many characters, too many words, too much action - too much like a bad Eastwood movie."
2,Just a formula effort.,"I found the newest Ludlum effort to be nothing more than a weak effort to produce another book for the masses. The dialog was predictable and cumbersome. After waiting for this book to appear in paperback for so long, I was dissappointed and cannot recommend it to casual readers."
1,Ludlum's Lost It,"Never felt a need to comment on a book before, but several janitors I've met in passing have more going for them than Ludlum's top agents in this book. The dialog is so unrealistic and contrived I had to check the cover to see if this was a Ludlum book. As I continued to read I kept thinking it was a first attempt by a bad writer. Totally disappointed, I've always enjoyed Ludlum, but this time he took the money and ran. If you want good, classic Ludlum, try the Bourne books or The Icarus Agenda and skip this one."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO LUDLUM,"ROBERT LUDLUM ONCE WROTE BOOKS YOU LITERALLY ""COULDN'T PUT DOWN"", BUT HIS MOST RECENT ATTEMPT AT A NOVEL 'THE MATARESE COUNTDOWN' WAS SO TEDIOUS, I NEARLY THREW IT OUT THE TRAIN WINDOW NUMEROUS TIMES.WHAT HAPPENED TO MR. LUDLUM THE FORMER MASTER OF INTRIGUE, THAT HE EVEN AGREES TO RELEASE THIS AMATEURISH ATTEMPT UNDER HIS WELL-RESPECTED NAME.IN CASE I HAVEN'T MADE MYSELF CLEAR - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK EXPECTING ANOTHER THRILLING LUDLUM NOVEL; YOU'LL BE GREATLY DISAPPOINTED."
1,The king is dead,"I discovered Ludlum before anyone I knew. Was caught, hook, line and sinker by his work. Fortunately, I've replaced him with other authors who display a much better talent for writing. I'm puzzled by his decline... a great wine gone terribly bad. I will never buy another Ludlum."
1,Hours I wish I could take back...,"Although I am far from a ""fan"" of Ludlums, I have read a few of his works, always having been entertained. That mild enthusiasm has come to a screeching halt with this trite, ponderous, tedious mess. Excruciatingly bad dialogue only serves to make it laughable, to boot. Please, heed my words and avoid this pedantic tome at all cost."
1,Horrendous,"With the Bourne books, Ludlum confirmed himself as the master of intrigue, although you quickly learn that if there is something difficult, or impossible, like Carlos knowing everything everyone in the U.S. Government knows, or having nearly supernatural powers, Ludlum just does it. He doesn't explain it. For awhile it comes across as mysterious and clever. Then you realize no, it is impossible and I just bought it. With this book, The Matarese Countdown, Ludlum clearly shows that whatever skill he had is now gone. This book is horrible. It is so unreadable as to make it painful. The plot and dialogue are insulting. If you haven't read this, don't! Stop now before you have to throw the book across the room. Read a cookbook instead."
1,Like watching an auto accident,"My first Ludlum book, the Osterman weekend was worthwhile so I picked up the Matarese Countdown. I find it difficult to believe this book was written by the same author. In fact I honestly believe it was ghost written by a first year intern as a test to see just how loyal Ludlum fans are. My complaint is not so much in plot line or character development as it is with dialogue.It would seem that Mr. Ludlum has arranged an agreement with his editor to be paid not by the word but by the exclamation point. The dialogue was juvenile, sophomoric and written, I swear, by a high school student. I kept with it, but like viewing an auto accident. I just couldn't help myself. I have read a few more of his books since and they are on a completely different level. Intelligent, well paced with great dialogue. So Mr. Ludlum, who really wrote that book?"
2,'The Matarese Countdown' is a mistake.,Mr Ludlum you are my favorite author and have read most of your books. But I have to say that 'The Matarese Countdown' is a big disappointment right from the start that i just have to stop reading it. I can't stand the inconsistencies of the details relating to 'The Matarese Circle'. Why refer to the past when you can't even give the correct details today. Why continue the story of the Matarese. I enjoyed your previous books but you certainly lost me on this one
1,A prime example of BANALITY!!!,"Reading this book has driven me to your ""customer's comments"" to see if I was alone in my utter dissappointment in this book. I see that I am not alone. The dialogue is the most banal, inane that I have ever read. Who in the world would believe that a renowned spymaster uses ""youngster"" and ""youngun"" in his every-day language? I have always enjoyed reading Ludlum and really looked forward to digging in (no pun intended) while the snow blew. This will be the first book in many years that I will not finish."
2,A good story when the writing didn't get in the way,"This book struck me as ""well I can't think of anything new, so I'll write a sequel"". He picked one of his best books and then tried to draw from it something that was never intended. One good point and the reason I finished the book is that I liked the people, even the new players. They were just given bad dialogue. I could have lived with the story if he didn't keep depending on stupid name calling like ""squinty"" or my favorite, reminiscing about the previous adventue that didn't happen to be mentiond in the former book. This great hero should have been left on his island. He served his time. A note to Mr Ludlum: Please don't write another Bourne book. I don't want that excellent series ruined."
2,Not one of Ludlum's better efforts,"I loved the Matarese Circle, so I was greatly looking forward to the sequel, the Matarese Countdown. I came away disappointed. The book took me seemingly forever to finish. I found it to be a bit slow. Not recommended."
3,Unusually poor thriller from the master.,"Having read and re-read The Materese Circle,I am gutted by the sheer transparency of the plot compared to the predecessor.Do not buy this book.It is an insult to the original."
3,"Robert Ludlum, always a good read.","Having read all of Ludlum's books I of course had to get this one as well. The best thing about Ludlum is that he throws You around in time. I enjoyed this book. He is more consistent in quality than i.e.John Grisham. But of Course, I rate The Matarese Circle and The Bourne Identity as top of the line."
2,SOME SEQUELS SHOULD NOT BE WRITTEN,"Several years ago, being an avid Ludlum reader, I purchased and read ""Matarese Circle"", I thoughly enjoyed it and was happy when I heard the story of Scofield and Antonia was to be continued. In anticipation of the release date I reread ""Matarese Circle"", so I could refresh myself with all the individuals. I was disappointed, in this book, a few things were new but most was the same old stuff. Scofield had grown old but not gracefully, he has turned into a crotchidy old man, and Tony always his suffering wife kept finding excuses for him. When there was action, it was good, but there was way to much talk and not enough action. The spark that was in the first one, has been lost in this one. The story line is the same, and a few twists and turns, maybe I have been spoiled with the ""matarese Circle"", and expected more of the same."
1,Why?,"The original Matarese was a fascinating, if slightly paranoid, discussion of world domination by an underground organization. Following Ludlum's inimitable style it built to a strong climax and kept the reader glued to every page. Unfortunately the sequel falls a long way short of this mark.Ludlum makes excessive use of the same trite expressions; the story-line requires wild leaps of faith and assumes completely unrealistic coincidences; and the characters remain completely flat.Having read and enjoyed almost every book Ludlum has written I found myself bitterly disappointed by this one - which ranks with ""The Road to Omaha"" in my top list of books NOT to buy!Better luck next time Robert!"
1,"Badly written, flat characters--need I say more?","At the very least, Ludlum should offer a public apology for this poor excuse for modern fiction. Characters don't tell each other something: they roar, they shout, and they generally overreact to every little thing. Come to think of it, Ludlum's editor(s) should offer an apology as well. The characters are one-dimensional, and I found myself cheering on the Matarese, hoping against hope that they would win out against the incompetent agents Ludlum has sent after them. Reading this book was like having your car stall on the railroad tracks; you can see the train coming, but you just can't move out of the way. Save your money."
2,Not a terrible book,"A well under par Ludlum book. Seems to have been scribbled on the back of a (very large) menu by Mr Ludlum. However, suspend your disbelief, put your tongue in your cheek and you will find reading it a pleasantly enjoyable enterprise. I speak as a fan of Ludlum - new readers of his may not find this a good introduction to him - they should try the Matarese Circle, Ludlum's best book."
2,Honestly? Who was the ghostwriter.,"I usually love books by this author. For the most part, I feel this is a ""go to"" author that I can count on to write a really good, really suspense filled novel that is both believable and entertaining. This book was neither. I really wonder if it was actually Robert Ludlum that wrote this book. I have never seen him write such a poor excuse for a book. The dialogue in this book is awful. It reminded me of something out of a seventies B-movie. I found myself cringing at least once per page whenever the characters would talk. The characters fell totally flat for me. No on in this book has a personality. I hate to have nothing at all nice to say about a book, but this one just isn't worth the time or the expense."
1,The Swedish Chef Meets Dudley Do-Right,"I bought the book-on-tape of The Matarese Countdown and have been listening to it in my car for the past few days. Big mistake. The dialogue in TMCis so hilariously awful -unintended, I'm sure, by the author and the actor who's reading the book to us -- that I'm laughing too hard to steer the car and see the road. Every German character sounds like Colonel Klink; every Swedish character sounds like the Swedish Chef; you get the picture. All of this comes at you in a pulsing staccato reminiscent of the urgent voiceovers on 50's newsreels. I see from other reviews that much of the dialogue in TMC is punctuated with !, which may explain the breathless narrative. Reading this book couldn't be any better than listening to it, so I recommend that you give it a miss."
1,Badly padded by publisher,"I just listened to this book on tape. Sounds as if the author was being paid by the word. My guess is that is was too short and the publisher tried to add length by fudging the dialog. Two phrases are over used and abused to make the book longer: ""son of the shepherd boy"" and ""pig of the world"". They ended up being finger nails on a chalkbored (spelling appropriate for the book)."
1,That's all for me,I too have read all of Ludlum 's earlier works. It seems he gets wordier and wordier with each book. What drove me over the edge was the wooden and implausible dialouge. I have read 2-3 books a week for 46 years. This is one of 3 I put aside without finishing. A major disappointment. Ludlum has been done a disservice by his editor and publisher.
3,not one of his bes,"I too am a Ludlum reader from way back, and I too was disappointed in this latest offering. While I can't comment on the accuracy of military or technilogical terminology, as a biologist I can't get past the glaring error in the scene where Cam and Leslie are attacked by birds of prey. Not only far fetched, but wrong! Birds of prey, except for vultures, have NO sense of smell. They are sight hunters and you can't train them to react to a sense they don't have. On another point, does anyone call his/her lover ""my darling"" ?!"
2,"Mr. Ludlam, please retire with dignity & peace","Mr. Ludlam, you have in your time given me such light, diversionary reading joy that I purchased by reflex your works in hard-cover for nearly two decades. In this, the best of your recent works, you burst my most willing suspension of disbelief by stating on page 17 by stating that this ""new circle"" of eight collectively is worth over a trillion dollars. Please, even eight Bill Gates' would have less than a third of that. This was a calculation I made while simultaneously diverting by this opus and Letterman. Thank you for the many, many hours of joy your past works have given me. Wow! In your field you were once the ""king"". Please retire with dignity or employ a demon researcher/writer as a co-author. Even in this disappointment you show that you can still ""plot"" with the best. God bless you and, again, thanks ""for the memories""."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A definite sequel to The Matarese Circle. Given not many of the Circle are still around, the bad guy of the piece is a grandson of one of the founders, and he wants to start the whole dastardly plan rolling again.It is up to some of the same guys, considerably older to stop them again. So, they have to pull retired agent Brandon Schofield out of mothballs and set him to work again, given he did it the first time."
5,Ludlum keeps the Circle going..and me too,Ludlam always writes a book that I can not put down. This was no exception. Having read the original Matarese Circle quite a while ago.. I now have the urge to read it again. This book reminded me of how good all of Robert Ludlums's books are( with a few exceptions).
3,Not great but not bad either.,"First off, I want to let NuViso@aol.com know that either he did not read the book or he just does not know how to read. The name is BRANDON SCHOFIELD, NOT ALAN SCHOFIELD. This is not the worst Ludlum book I have read. The Road to Omaha was the worst ever. I started reading Robert Ludlum on a bet and have not regretted it once. I have read all of his books. The only thing that I have to say is to please do better research."
3,Ludlum falls on face,"Alan Schofield returns to fight an implausible enemy with the return of the Matarese. But the story was slow moving and even the personality of Alan/Beowulf was different. It ""appears"" that Mr. Ludlum is trying to become a comedian after his sorrowful ""road"" books. His early books, especially The Bourne series were great but his latest is a big letdown for me."
2,Ludlum no longer has the touch,"This once great writer has produced in this latest novel a work that comes across as a poor characacture of his once powerful style. I suppose he and his editor believe his name will still sell. Unfortunately, they are probably right. However, I couldn't even finish the book-if I read one more reference to the great ""Beowulf Agate"" I would have screamed."
2,"What it could have been, and what it was","It could have been an exciting weekend in Paris, London, Amsterdam and Rome, full of daring-do and saving the world(once again),outwitting the evil Villians while romancing a beautiful woman. Instead it was a ""pleasently ok"" book. It was after 10 o'clock on, a dark and stormy night when i first found out that Roberet Ludlum had a new book out, Knowing that the local Book store stays open til eleven. I raced to the phone to reserve a copy and anticipated going to work the following day half asleep from staying up all night reading. when I arrived at the store, barely minutes before closing to snatch up a copy, the clerk said that I was the second person to buy a copy that entire week! Sad to say that this latest book by Mr. Ludlum like his last several others have recycled characters and plots"
1,Way to cliche - Overly dramatic,"The main characters were over-blown with spy personalities. General plot was okay, but could have used some refinement. Worldwide financial cartel decides to wreck worlds economy and the become the savior to gain world dominon. Didn't see enough of how they planned this because Ludlum focused too much on making the heros into cowboys."
1,The Matarese Countdown,"As a respectful fan of Mr. Ludlum I'm afraid to say that I found this book a massive disappointment and ultimately unreadable. The dialogue is awkward, the technology is laughably old fashioned and the characters are two dimensional stereotypes.This is Ludlum on auto-pilot, missing all his essential passion that he normally packs punches with. I'd rather re-read the ""Parsifal Mosaic"", ""Road to Gandelfo"" and ""Osterman weekend"" ten times than endure this uncharacteristic dross."
2,"stilted, wooden dialogue","I found that the characters spoke so artificially in this novel that I was laughing out loud at times. The plot was ridiculously far fetched, but I just might try another Ludlum to see if he can do better!"
1,I can't believe this was actually written by Ludlum!,"Years ago I read virtually everything Ludlum had written.""The Matarese Circle"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" are two of my favorites and I would recommend them to anyone. This book was horrible. I really tried to read it, but after awhile I just couldn't take the outrageous diaglogue and stupid plot. The original character of Brandon Scofield was an intelligent, soft spoken, man of action. This Scofield was a bufoon!! If he were real, he'd being suing for defamation of character!!! I did manage to read to the end (though I did have to skip several sections) and it was one of the most anticlimatic endings ever. I would love to read some more of his newer books, but after this I'm very reluctant to take the chance. I honestly have a hard time believing he actually wrote this book himself."
1,Extremely disappointed,"This must be a joke! Ludlum could not have written this book. I've read everything he's written - and he's obviously not present in this deceptive piece of trash. It's as hard to beleive the collusion of publisher, editor, and author in this blatant deception as it is to swallow the poorly conceived plot and the incredibly sophomoric dialog. Unless an apology is forthcoming, I'm sure that I as well as other fans will never touch another new Ludlum creation."
4,Thrilling,"I had not read the original Matarese novel, but found that I had no problem following the plot. This was a very exciting novel; very well written."
1,Erm... well... nope.,I don't quite know what happened! It seems that the Robert Ludlum that we all know and love had a bad case of writer's block! The characters were as weak as the shockingly poor dialog in this fiasco of a novel. Excuse me for sounding patronizing here... but keep trying Robert!
1,a total let down,A very disappointing book- Ludlum appears to have written this book as though it was the movie script for a third rate film. The characters and dialogue are totally unbelievable. I have always enjoyed reading Mr Ludlum's books but this one was truly appalling.
1,Why?,"I wonder why Mr. Ludlum can't call it a day instead of printing books like this one or ""Cry Of Halidon"" or ""Apoclaypse Watch"". He's not the same writer who gave us Bourne series and Rhinemann Exchange. I've been a great fan of Ludlum, but I can't just finish this book."
1,"That's it---I give up. Uncle, Uncle, Uncle.","I've read 20-25 books a year for the past ten years. This is the first time I've given up on a book during that entire time. I slogged through more than 375 pages, expecting it to ""get on with it,"" settle in, and get good. It didn't. This is the last Ludlum book I'll ever pick up.Over the hill, and now living off a reputation that he only once deserved, Bob need to find a new way to make a living."
1,Certainly not the Robert Ludlam of old.,"I struggled through the first 100 pages before deciding to stop reading this book. Whoever is writing this book is certainly not the Robert Ludlam of old. As an avid reader, who goes through 30 - 40 books a year, this is only the second time I have quit in the middle of a book. The other one? - The Road to Omaha. Ludlam's characters are unbelievable and the dialogue is inane. No one just speaks, the shout or scream and seem to be mad at everything that is said. No more Mr. Ludlam for me. Twice burnt is enough."
4,A Good Read,Despite what other people have said about this book I really enjoyed it. It was the first Robert Ludlum book that i actually managed to get to the end of and also read twice.The Plot was good and it was also helpful that you didn't need to have read the first book The Matarese Circle. The characters were clever and were easy to visualise in the situation. I recommend the book to anyone thinking of reading of ludlum but hasn't enjoyed some of the others.
2,I believe I bought the only one of these they sold.,"At the time this was released, most people were hung-over on Garth, so no one had time for the Dirt Band, apparently not even the Dirt Band.This seems like a rushed project that no one really wanted to do because they knew it would't sell no matter what.But don't sell it all short, there are a few songs worth listening to, such as ""Little Angel,"" ""One Good Love,"" and ""Dont' Underestimate Love.""The rest of the cd, ""Not Fade Away,"" ""I Fought the Law,"" ""Mama Tried,"" and (gulp) ""Mother of the Bride,"" and (yikes) ""The Dream"" should have been enough to make any deaf man glad he couldn't hear.To summarize this cd, it is recorded with a lot of jingly, loud guitar licks. Some is good, but some is awful.Complete song listing: Not Fade Away; Little Angel; Mama Tried; One Good Love; Losin' You; I Fought the Law; Mother of the Bride; Don't Underestimate Love; What'll You Do About Me; The Dream."
5,Most stimulating book,I have forwarded this book to friends because it raises so many issues about families economics morals and the changing word
2,nannies and sex workers in same title is offensive,"As the mother of five that relied on childcare during the many years of single parenting I think we tend to concentrate too much on the elite and their need for childcare. The notion that this childcare contributes to the foreign exchange is a little off base when in reality it contributes to an underground economy because the salaries are mostly off the books and taxes are not paid in any form. Safety issues also arise when you consider that most of the illegeal aliens caring for our children have never had childhood immunizations, and refuse the TB test. This may sound unimportant and nit picking but the reality is diseases we thought were erradicated like whooping cough can be traced to the unimmunized worker. Leaving your children behind to take care of mine is something we as a nation should give more thought about."
5,Excellent resource for business situations,Routledge's Manual of Business French provides an excellent resource for both oral and written communication in a wide variety of business situations. The dialogues are particularly useful for contextual expressions and pronunciation practice.
2,Classic book but missing illustrations,"I was excited to own a physical copy of this reference, but the books is missing illustrations/photos, which makes it nearly worthless. The original book included illustrations, and can be viewed on Google Books."
1,Too many things burned up while cooking,"I grill a lot and got this book as a gift. Frankly, I don't think I have ever seen a book filled with such poorly thought-out recipes. She seems to think you can cook ANYTHING on a grill. Yes, you can cook many things on a grill, but you need an accurate recipe to do so properly. At least half of the dozen or so recipes I have tried burned up while cooking. I find it hard to believe that her publisher would put out a book without trying out the recipes, but I suspect that that's the case here. Too bad. I'm sure that most of the recipes could have been saved if someone had cared enough to edit them. Too bad no one did."
5,Added to my large Sandra Lee Collection,This cookbook is really easy & no one realizes that the recipes have been edited-Just for Me!!! Love Sandra Lee
4,Don't be a Hater!!!,"It is interesting that 3 of the one-star reviewers have only reviewed two of Sandra's book!!! I have 3 of Sandra's 4 books. I was originally given the first on as a gift. I am a busy mom with three kids and little time to think, much less pull together dinner. Sandra offers quick and easy recipes that don't require unheard of ingredients that I have to run all over town looking for. What I love about her grilling book, is that now my husband can cook some great food for guests on the weekend. Contrary to one of the reviewers, if she had actually read the book, she would realize that the indoor recipes do not require and indoor grill. I have already given this book to my parents and my sisters, and would recommend it to anyone who loves to grill!"
3,DVD's skipping!,"Maybe it's too early to tell. I recorded some Hi-8 camcorder tapes onto DVD's just fine with this product, but have yet to figure out how to convert them on the computer to a format with which I can edit the video into clips with my computer's video editing software. The problem is, after about a month of use as a DVD player, some of my kids' DVD's are all garbled and un-playable! They work fine on our other DVD players and the problem doesn't happen with all our movies, just some of them. It's frustrating. I'm going to try to get a head cleaner, but I am afraid this is a problem with the DVD player since it is brand new and should not have to be cleaned. I have another DVD player that is probably five years old, never had a head cleaning, and works like a charm. So, I give this one three stars."
1,Out of date!,This unit hasn't been produced since 2003. Could not get it to work with a high def TV. Even tried using coax and rgb outputs and it still didn't work. I called for tech service and the rep said he couldn't believe that these units were still being sold as new.
3,Okay,"This worked decent when we first got it. After a while the recording function stopped, then it stopped reading discs all together."
1,Return non working product cant reach disconet,I ordered the sylvania video recorder.now the number for disconet doesnt work and amazon is making me wait 24 days for replacement or refund.
1,This thing is Junk!!!!!!!!,"Don't waist your time with this thing. I, assuming from the good reviews that this was a decent machine, bought it and suffered with the same disk errors as a few of the other customers. I will definitely think twice before I ever buy a Sylvania product again."
1,"Can't get this thing to work, I wish I had chosen another brand.","I have had this machine for 2 days. I have tried 5 different brands of DVD-R discs, and so far I haven't found any which will work in this unit. No matter what I try to use, I get the ""Disc Error"" message. I spoke to Sylvania's customer support people, who told me it will only work with Maxell CD-R discs and DVD-RW discs. I can't find anyone around me who has Maxell, they all carry Memorex, Fuji, Verbatim, Sony,TDK, but no Maxells. I tested it to see if it will play a DVD, and it will. So basically this thing only functions as a conventional DVD player with no recording capabilities. It is either a very poor quality item, or it is defective, or damaged in shipping. In any case, I am back where I started, and I need to buy a DVD recorder."
5,Gread DVD recorder,This DVD Recorder worked great right out of the box with 16x DVD-Rs and 16x DVD-RWs. Good quality video usually gets 4 hours to a disc. I cycle 3 DVD RWs and can record shows and TV movies for watching later. TV tuner is great.
2,Just so-so,Too low on glycerine to last very long. Did not like the taste at all. Needs a bit more mint to mask whatever causes the yucky after-taste.
2,It was ok!,"It was ok, taste is alright only lasts a few minutes,, thought it would at liest last an hour or so,, oh well"
2,Not what I expected.,Didn't work for me and I didn't like the taste. I like Stoppers4 much better so I will stick with it.
4,Fun in the sun,"Over the years I've read hundreds of novels in a variety of genres, but for pure fun and enjoyment it's hard to beat Travis McGee. Some of the books are better than others, but they're nearly all worth a couple of lazy summer days. They are the ultimate summer time (or any other season for that matter), quick-read books. At their core, they're good mysteries. But Travis McGee is such a great character, with such a wry outlook on life, that often the mystery seems secondary to McGee's views on whatever topic author John D. McDonald has selected for his soap box. Most of them take place in Florida, (a Florida no one will ever see again given they were written mostly in the 60s and 70s) and all have a color in the title. Don't take them too seriously, just have fun in the sun."
2,I didn't understand the book.,"The book was very confusing. If I would of been able to understand, it would of been a great book."
3,"good product, terrible shipping",the product arrived in perfect condition. shipping is ridiculously slow. will not order again from this seller.
1,Horrible clasp on these things,I have not yet been able to fasten these things while they are in my ears. They are not useful to me at all.
4,Nice Size,"These were a nice size, but they were pretty difficult to get on. I thought the hinge back would be easier but the size was too small for man fingers! Definitly need a womens help. He has had them on for over 2 months with no complaints and they look great!"
5,DEEP,What can I say this workbook along with the book itself hits you right between the eyes! BAM! It's no joke. If you are looking for a shallow book then don't buy this one. The authors really do want to help you and I feel better already.
3,Workbook contains lots of Work,This Workbook has some great information but is lots of work for the average working busy life person.
3,Not for me,"This book is a good book, just not what I needed. It seamed to be for people with deep issues with other things in life which has lead to over eating. To be honest, I started but did not finish the book, I was just not feeling it."
4,Lose It for Life,"My Bible-study group enjoyed this book and had varying success in losing weight as a result of the study. We felt it was helpful in learning to change ones lifestyle and attitude toward food. However, as a Bible study, we'd like to see more scripture in the daily sessions."
2,disappointed,I guess I wasn't thinking when I purchased a slightly used workbook.I wasn't expeting to find it already filled in. So I haven't used it.Anyone buying used books knows that most of the time they are great.But rethink the issue of purchasing a used work book.
1,One Huge Fraud!,"I hate to burst the bubble of all those who have been taken in by Gayle Rivers, but this book is one, huge fraud from beginning to end. Rivers was shown to be an ex-Air Force officer from either Australia or New Zealand many years ago. He had absolutely NOTHING to do with SpecOps during the Vietnam War. Just another hoax out of thousands over the past 20 years. In fact, he went on to write another bogus book about his ""commando"" operations in Lebanon during the early 1980's.Rivers fits in perfectly with the type of Vietnam frauds depicted in B.G. Burkett's, ""Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation was Robbed of its Heroes and its History."" As a former Marine Corps infantry officer (1984-1991) I am absolutely amazed at how many people buy into this trash. There are many fine books out there regarding the Vietnam War. This one, however, is pure fantasy!"
4,Gripping and Action Packed,"It is probably not a war novel that will be revered as the greatest writing of all time, but it is well written and does a very effective job of building an interest in the characters, keeping a high degree of action flowing in a realistic way, and moving the plot towards its conclusion (and the ultimate success or failure of the main characters' mission).This one reads very quickly and will not be promptly forgotten."
5,The Five Fingers,Never have I read a book like this. It was amazing because it was nonfiction. I found it horrifying and astonoshing. I have never finished a book in less than a month and I finished this one in two and a half weeks. It is absolutly amazing. A harrowing account of the Special Forces in Vietnam. It is a must read for any war buffs out there. If anyone knows any details on this mission please e-mail me ASAP.
1,PASS ON THIS ONE!,"This story has an interesting premise: during the Vietnam War the US Army sends an international team on foot up through Laos and into southern China to take out a group of Communist big shots. The story understandably drags a bit through the preparatory phase of this squad's impossible mission. And I was a game reader, even letting a few incorrect factoids pass regarding the weapons they were to use. But when the author in the first person indicates that he is going to carry ammunition components and reload his empties along the way, it was just too much! One has to wonder if the author is just another ""drug store cowboy/soldier wannabe"" when he cannot even get the basics right in this obviously fictional piece. There are too many good books out there to be read for you to waste your time on this."
5,Pretty Good B-Daman,"This is a Power Type B-daman based on it's Helio Arms. I guessit's educational because you have to put it together... Theproblem is the horns keep falling off, but you can fix it byglueing the horns down. This is a cool toy!!! The best game forthis B-daman is Battle Hammer."
3,Something missing,"When I first bought this album, it seemed worthwhile. As time passes, the album only gets pulled out when its turn arises (I use a self written computer controlled system which lists when I last played an album). It does have a couple of tracks which stand out 'Black Cat Bone' and 'She's cold as ice' which highlight Roy Roger's slide guitar. However, the remainder do not excite me anymore."
1,Missed the Point,"This highly scholarly book obscures the life and teachings of Jesus to the max. Instead of allowing the orderly unfolding of the man and his life, he reorganizes, categorizes, deletes and analyses extensively and thereby distorts the historical texts that report the life of Jesus.Where can one read the Synoptic Gospels as they were written?! Anyone wanting a clear, orderly and enlightening view of the historical man Jesus should look at the books by Henry Burton Sharman."
1,Wishful thinking and political agenda,"It is fantastic to me the extent to which this ""theory"" is taken, especially if we bear in mind that there is not a hint of extra-biblical evidence for the existence of a person with a ""biography"" even remotely similar to the one we believe we have of Jesus.Another ""Jesus Book"" written with the background of the current Israel-Palestine political situation.A waste of time of galactic proportions."
4,"A good foil to ""The Five Gospels""","This book is a must for anyone seriously trying to sort out what might be the authentic words of Jesus from additions made by the gospel writers. My first such journey was with the ""Five Gospels"", by the Jesus Seminar, which is also a ""must"" read. Vermes uses a different approach, using his background in Judaism of the first century, including being an expert on the Dead Sea scrolls. Remarkably, these two sources agree on the majority of the possible speeches. Vermes has valid reasons for rejecting some of the Jesus Seminar's choices. He adds many more sayings. Some of these are very short and don't add much to my understanding, while others are well worth considering."
5,Jesus; exposed!,If you are interested in deconstructing Jesus (from his most likely saying to the Jewish contexts of his life and religion) then I highly recommend this book.
2,Some Guidance Required,"Dr. Wilson does assume a lot when asking readers to follow his ramblings, however as an introduction to basic historiography the book can be useful. Having been part of an undergraduate seminar with Dr. Wilson in the first edition's formative stages, I can only assume that the 2nd edition was meant to be used by undergraduates only when assisted by a very knowing and able guide. The author himself and/or possibly other scholars could help unleash the benefits of text, but to ask most undergraduates to read as a stand alone without guidance, it is probably asking too much."
3,Good start,"Netegrity SiteMinder, currently CA SiteMinder, is an industry leader and a de-facto standard product in web access management and it lays the foundation for the identity access management product, CA IdentityMinder.I would strongly suggest that readers take a look at my book ""SiteMinder FAQ"" (published by Bookstand publishing) for details - it has been well-accepted in the web security world by administrators and corporate decision makers as well."
4,great prop,"This was a great photo prop, but knocking it down a star for lack of more pictures in context. Yes the size is clearly marked, but it doesn't really convey just how small the metal scrub area really is."
3,Smaller than expected,"The working area on this board is a bit smaller, than I expected it to be. Still good for small fulling projects, although better to watch for those splinters in the wood."
4,Must read for Magic:tG fans,"Focusing on the people, this tells of the war between Urza and Mishra. You'll learn how the brothers became interested in artifice, and how they went beyond it. You'll know not only the events of the war, but why the war was waged. You'll read of many familiar figures, such as Ashnod, Tawnos, Drafna, Hurkyl, and Feldon. If you find yourself reading the flavour text on the cards you play, and enjoying the story there, this is the book for you."
3,Brother's War ~ Jeff Grubb,"Well, the storyline was interesting and well put together, but it concentrated too much on description and not enough on feeling. Not to mention the horrible typo's and grammatical errors... I personally think it is just shy of being four-star."
3,Enjoyable read.,"Good book for anyone wishing to explore the universe of Magic the Gathering (MTG). Basically a tale of brother against brother, brains against brawn.Easy reading, nice imagery and a logical plot. No big surprises. Any MTG fan will enjoy."
4,Nice Historical Background to Magic,"This book is well-written and gives a good dose of information on the background and mythology involving Urza & Mishra. If you play Magic, this book really gives you great 'atmosphere' behind some of the cards. If you don't play Magic, read this book and check out the game."
5,My All-Time Favorite Book,"This has got to be the best Magic: The Gathering Novel ever written! It reveals the history of Urza and Mishra and the war between them. It also reveals familiar Magic: the Gathering icons such as Urza and Mishra themselves, Tawnos, Ashnod and her Transmogrants, Feldon, the su chi, and many others. A true masterpiece among fantasy novels."
4,Overall it was a good book,Overall the book was good. But there were a few mistakes. Like how did the first dragon engine get tho that campsite and was it made by the thran or the Phyrexian's. Or when did they do what they did to Mishra. Do to those I'd give it a 4 star instead of five.
4,Good for Maqic players.,"If you are into Magic the game you will enjoy the book. It adds some understanding to where some of the orginal cards came from. Good plot, with a good twist at the end. Enjoyable, quick read."
5,Best book i've read!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is awesome, I have been a player and collector of magic: the gathering cards for a long time, but when I picked up this book it changed how I saw the game. The story is awesome and I have now read 14 of the Magic books. I still believe this is the best and Jeff Grubb is by far the most enjoyable author. I recommend all of the MTG books, especially the ones written by Jeff Grubb."
4,The Eaneid of Dominia,"I truly enjoyed the book. I also understood alot about the war between the two brothers and how it effect the entire world. I was expecting something more about the Ice Age and how these events are related.. I hope, however, that it will be explained later in the cycle. I believe that this is a fundamental book."
4,Great DVD,This was a great DVD on Las Vegas. Very current and had a good mix of hotel attractions and family things to do. I liked the show clips like Danny Gans. Made my trip to LV more fun now that I new what to look for and check out. Although I did not need the diffrent language tracks I think that it is a great plus to have Spanish German and Japanese all on the same DVD
4,Great Photographic History Of The Doors,"The Doors is basically the same as all the other Bison Group books that I have. Mainly filled with great pictures and a little history. This one was a great gift from my Aunt. It even comes with a poster.The Doors personify the image of 'Rock Gods'. To me, they are basically one of the first groups ever to be so dang cool.If anyone has a link to the publisher I would be grateful."
3,Game Freezes up-BEWARE,"I like the game but, once you get past 100k points, the game freezes up. Of course I cannot return it because the return time has passed. So BEWARE."
5,adult player,"As an adult player.. (shh 39!) I find this game very relaxing and can pick it up and just play it. No real thinking just RELAXING!! It is hard to find a game that isn't Mario, Pokey mon or anything commerical like that. I carry my Gameboy SP with me in my purse.. No it's not a cell phone!!!!!LuLu"
4,I imagine that this will be great,"I love Book-Worm on the computer, and can't wait to purchase the GBA version. I'm 11 and love games (video games) that stretch my mind. Unfortunatly, Amazon.com is out of stock at the time of my writing. I rated 5 stars because I love Book-Worm no matter what or where."
5,Vocabulary Builder,"As an adult, I appreciate a mental game. This untimed game has the ability to entertain for hours. With the save feature, the game can be played over a span of time, which is great if you experience interruptions! Some of us are not able play lenghty uninterrupted games, nor do we need the added frustration of ""hurry up or you die"" games. I have had no problems whatsoever with freezing or graphics, and it's one of my GBA favorites. It's addictive and relaxing."
4,The next best thing to have the real Tom Welling,"Who wouldn't, in their right mind, want Tom to come over and have dinner or spend the night. I would but, in all reality, that's not going to happen so, why not get the Clark Kent Doll. You can bend him, put him on your computer and even take him to work with you."
3,Only for a Smallville fan,"I love Smallville and have loved most of the things that have come out representing the awesome franchise. The Clark Kent action figure really isn't one of those things I do love.Kids can play with it and enjoy it, they'll just have to use there imagination. The toy doesn't really do anything, so that's why the imagination is a must. They can have fun with it however, because he is Superman and only Kryptonite can stop him. If your child likes Smallville they should enjoy it. If they don't, the toy isn't for them. If your a Smallville collector, you'll like the toy."
1,Saucony Grid Triumph 3,"I tried on a size 12 in the Super Runner's Shop in NYC which felt like I was walking on a soft marshmellow cloud but the size was a tad tight. Searched various runners stores in NYC for a twelve and a half to no avail and ended up ordering on line, size twelve and a half. They aren't the same and although the fit is good, they're way too hard.I gave them to my stepson and ended up with a pair of Brooks instead: pricier but considerably better.For God's sake: don't buy runing shoes on-line!"
4,Saucony Triumph 3D,"Extremely comfortable shoes perfect for the heavier runner who runs up to an hour daily. Not a big fan of the white laces. Treads are a little deep for the type of running shoe that it is. I went running on the street and had to stop a few times to remove rocks from between the treads. A little on the heavy side but makes an excellent training shoe. Overall, extremel happy."
2,Slightly Dissapointing,This is a mediocre album. No where as good as Dick Wagner's work with Lou Reed and Alice Cooper. It seems Dick is more of a guiterist than song writer.
1,Not who I thought they were - their style is beyound my taste,"Not who I thought they were - their style is beyound my taste, so I will drop it off at the kitchen counter at work for someone esle to 'enjoy'"
4,Big Trouble Worth It,"Quality DVD. I bought it for ""Big Trouble which is hilarious. ""The Crew"" is top notch entertainment. But then there's ""Oscar"" . While I like Mr. Stallone in other genre, I didn't like this movie. It's too cute, which is not really my cup of tea and why I deducted one star."
3,Best deal of the pack is Oscar,"It was cheaper to get the 3pack of movies for the price I would have paid for Oscar. The reviews for the other movies was great. But was disappointed with Big Trouble, that some reviews gave high marks to. Did enjoy The Trouble."
2,so-so,Big trouble was good.Oscar was OK. Not that great and not that bad.The crew was boring and stupid.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Save your money
4,"Big Trouble,The Crew & Oscar","This triple feature gives you a great value for your money's worth. You get three entertaining, good movies for a very fair price."
3,just fair,"This is an okay weather station - however, you have to toggle to get inside temperature and we find that shouldn't be necessary for the price paid. Also it is not easy to re-set the rain guage."
2,Terrible Customer Service - Poor Software,"As I leave my third e-mail and get dropped off the phone for the third time I question why I every bought this thing. My hardwired outside temperature sensor is reading about 20-degrees higher than actual. My rain guage stopped working and I can't get anybody at their CS department to answer my calls.Save your money and buy something else, but before you do, call their customer service department and see what happens. LaCrosse is crossed off my list."
2,Lacks customization of screen,"I have been using the 2308 for about six months and like its range. The rain gauge is accurate enough for my use. My big complaint is I can not easily reset the rain totals and can not easily see the key numbers I want. Namely in door and out door temperature now, rain since last reset, humidity, wind speed and direction. These, as far as I know are not on one easy screen and can not be put on one easy screen. To see how much rain has fallen while the in door temperature is showing I have to press buttons. To reset the total rain fall or any other history, I have to press an incomprensable set of buttons that I can't remember so they don't get reset. This is not an easy device to use.If by some chance, I can customize the screen, it would sure be great for the customization settings to be in the instructions somewhere. I have not been able to find them."
2,Garbage software,"The device works well enough, but I am disappointed it is not a continual feed, and some of the info must be dug out from several menu layers.The primary disappointment for me is that the units requires a SERIAL port to communicate with a PC. A SERIAL PORT? What is this 1985? Come on guys - get to the age of USB - or even better - wireless. Serial port? You must be joking.Even worse - the directions specifically say that it WILL NOT WORK WITH A SERIAL TO USB ADAPTER - and I have found that to be correct.The software leaves much to be desired as well.If I were to do it again... I wouldn't"
3,Wind speed gauge blows,"Purchased this item for the rain and wind gauge. While the rain sensor seems to be quite accurate, the anemometer is definitely inaccurate."
2,Doors Boot Yer Butt,"I am a HUGE Doors fan and collector. I have many many audience recordings and i know those audience recordings are NOT soundboard.......who cares? I love my Doors collection..Boot Yer Butt is just a simple collection of the best of Doors bootlegs...but i am really disappointed... Soundquaity is really horrible, sometimes it's worse than the real tape sound... only 15% is better than my sources...for example: singer bowl, long beach, la forum...Nothing new for the hardcore collectors...and 80 bucks??? CRAP.Don't waste your money. Trust me."
1,Doors fans and non Doors fans stay away !!!!,"Worst idea ever! This is the biggest waste of money a doors fan could see on the music store shelves! There is NO way that this is worth! 90$. The 4TH cd is the best ... and there are only 4 songs on it that you would say are awesome doors songs to have in your collection.... Why and how can a group ( there not a group anymore since jim is dead ) this day in age can put out a low low quality cd and charge this much? Well because there are doors fans like me out there not smart enough to stop themselves. However, I hope that this review stops you from buying these cd's! And remember each cd comes with the lines ""No Returns! "" on it.They better put out a SB show soon because once you get this you will be sick of the doors!"
1,SAD,"It is sad that such poor material has been made availible as an official release. I have never shelled out more money for less quality. I am one of those people that have all of The Doors material in every format it has been released in. As bootlegs these tracks were barely able to be listened to. As official release material they are just pathetic. If ""Live in Detroit"" was the glorious heights, ""Boot your Butt"" is surely the depths of despair for any Doors fan. Buy it, if you most. I did, not that I'm proud of it."
5,THE BIGGEST COLLECTORS ITEM IN THE ENTIRE DOORS CATALOGUE. A MUST OWN..,"This is the Doors live and at it's best. All recordings are from live shows around the country. Only live versions of L.A. Woman and Changeling that have ever surfaced. If you are a Doors nut this Box is for you. Yes, a bit pricey but this is the most sought after Doors Box on the market period. Long Out of Print. Only 5,000 sets were manufactured so if you can grab one do so. Light My Fire live from Hawaii show in 70 is worth the price alone. 20 minutes of mind blowing music you will ever hear. A superb box set *****"
2,ONLY Live recordings of Morrison singing LA WOMAN and Changeling,"Boot your Butt is short for ""bootleg"". These recordings are mainly audience tap recordings, 2 gems are from the very last Jim Morrison show ever, Dec 1970 in Dallas, TX. The Changeling and LA WOMAN, LA WOMAN itself is over 16 mins, just a real shame it wasn't professionally recorded. Good to buy those 2 songs via MP3 download, the rest you can shelve."
1,Avoid This One,"Instead of taking revenge on bootleggers, the Doors (specifically Robby Krieger) take revenge on their fans with this box set. Specifically those who bought the earlier Bright Midnight releases and were satisfied are going to be mightily disappointed and feel betrayed.I would heavily recommend passing on this set due to the poor sound quality and very high price.If you can handle the poor sound quality and want this for historical purposes or completism, I would recommend waiting for the price of used copies to drop around $20.If ""war is too important to be left to the generals"", well this proves that archive catalog releases are too important to be left to the artists."
2,good from a historical point of view,"i bought this when it came out, not sure what i paid for it, but it didnt seem exorbitant at the time. i would not recommend anyone paying more than 50$ for this. the audio quality is terrible, most of the performances are sub par. as any doors fan knows or will come to know the doors could be electric live, but for the most part jim is drunk an not commited to giving his best perfomance, there are some gems, and there are some songs worth having on this just from a historical point of view other than that stick to live in philly an detroit if you wanna hear the best of the doors live. I listened to this whole album all the way through once, an from then on it sat on my dvd rack collecting dust, while the doors superior perfomances are on constant rotation."
1,Don't bother,"The producers may have had good intentions, but this was the most poorly donemovie I have seen in a while. The message might have been good, but couldn'tget past the poor acting and filming."
4,Smile for my friends and cry later,"This is a must have CD, full of classics that made you heart feel the lyrics and fills your ears with pleasure."
5,Great history text,"This is a great history textbook. I used it in my graduate classes on church history. Chadwick's volume is comparable, the only difference being Gonzales slight protestant leanings."
5,Great book,Great book for any level of Church History student. Easy to read and very easy to understand. Lots of valuable information.
4,The Story of Christianity Volume 2,"This review is more of a continuation of the review for Volume 1. This book covers the turbulent years of the reformation and its aftermath. The Reformation triggered decades of relgious war between Catholic and Protestant and had ramifications across the western world. Gonzalez analyses these events and carries the history forward to the establishment of America (which has its own challenges).Again, this book should be part of any interested person's reference library. It is well written and very readable."
3,not just for legal scholars,"A fascinating historical perspective on the post-Civil War constitutional amendments which gives much needed background on family rights as aspects of liberty. I take serious issue with the New York Times review, which gave short shrift to Professor Davis' analysis. I read this book in law school but it is accessible to any reader interested in law and the public discourse on family values."
5,a must-have Christmas CD for every family,"I grew up listening to the Ray Conniff singers every Christmas season in the Philippines back in the 70's, thanks to my father who had most of the Ray Conniff albums which he bought in the 1960s and early 1970s. I think everyone agrees that the beautiful voices of the singers enhances the special feeling that we all have for Christmas. I intend to get not just this CD, but also the Christmas medley album made by Ray Conniff in 1962 or so. I intend to share this CD with my dad, so that both of us will remember the good old days of Christmas past."
5,A#1,"Quintessential - I am certain that I will only be happy when I repeat my vows on Christmas Eve to the sound of Christmas Bride. The best. Just a sprinkle of reindeer dust, a sprig of mistletoe....Bring on the bubble lights, glass beads and icicles made of lead. The good old days. My children know it by heart and I sent it to my brother and sisters. Here's to Ray!"
5,This is what a happy Christmas is all about!,"This album is a family gem and included at every holiday celebration since since childhood. Love it! The song ""Christmas Bride"" is my all-time favorite song. Thanks Amazon.com for making this available."
5,Childhood Memories,Love this album my Dad used to play this every Christmas in cassette and now I have updated it for him on CD he loved this and hearing this music brings back all those Christmas memories and it makes me feel the spirit of Christmas every time I listen to it.
4,Christmas With Conniff,"Our Christmas seasons growing up just would not have been the same without this timeless holiday music. The renditions are stirring and evocative of a world gone by. It does not surprise me that young people are again feeling the tug of the well-produced music. The ""kitchy"" feel even makes it more attractive in this world of sampled everything. Unless I miss my guess, it'll brighten your holidays as it has done for decades for so many of us."
1,Horrible Sound on 2010 Hallmark edition !!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a review just on the 2010 ""Hallmark"" re-releaseI'll be short & not so sweet on this one. DON'T BUY THIS RE-RELEASE !!!!! Buy the ORIGINAL COLUMBIA VERSION !! On this one, the sound is absolutely terrible. I don't even think its in stereo !!!!!I love all the Ray Conniff Christmas albums (including Christmas with Conniff). Its what I grew up with. As soon as I hear any of these, it instantly takes me back to my childhood. Its been many years since Columbia originally released this on CD, so I thought this might be an upgrade as far as sound goes. Well, the joke was on me !! The original sounds fine & totally blows this distorted, nasty version away !!"
5,"This is Christmas for my childhood, and now adulthood","This album has excellent stereo sound, nice arrangements, in fact, it could even get you out of holiday depression. I too listened to this album on my parents stereo in the late 60's and now my kids do too. Who could forget ""Frosty"" with the 'pop' and harp at the end, or ""Who put that rock in the snowball"" at the end of ""Sleigh Ride""? This is a fun album. I've never heard another artist do the song ""Christmas Bride"" yet, but it's a good one. ENJOY!"
5,Excelent Purchase,"The book has really more information than I expected. Many maps, adventure hooks, and all in a very intuitive layout. I recommend it to anyone who'd like to play RPG in a modern city, even if not in Cyberpunk 2020 rules, since most of the information is not linked to game rules, but general description"
2,Not Intended For Tourists,"Unless you are planning to move to Seattle, this video probably won't be useful for you. It is intended as a moving guide with info about residential areas,real estate, insurance, etc. and virtually no coverage of the things an armchair traveler or potential tourist would want to see."
3,cute but not great,It does make a nice gift but not for real tea lovers if not just for show. The infuser ball really only works with larger lea leaves. You are buying the set and for that price you get what you get.
3,Cute but not great,"I agree that it is cute but not great. It's part of a gift set I am putting together so it is fine but I can't imagine that she will ever really use it. The decorations are larger than they look and the tea pot is just stuck ontop of a plain spoon...soooo...like another review said you get what you pay for and it is fine. However, if this were the only part of the gift I were giving, I would be dissapointed."
1,Weakly glued collection of stories,"While reading it I couldn't help having the feeling that the book is written by a journalist with superficial knowledge of the field. The books seems to be a collection of interviews and quotes, weakly woven. It was a pleasant easy reading though."
2,"Could be interesting, but WAY over my head . . .","The idea of a quantum computer is quite fascinating. Since a colleague of mine studied quantum computing at Oxford, I thought I might read up on the subject. My expectations were that ""The Quest"" would be something that would get the lay reader up to speed. I don't mind being stretched a bit (I have a Ph.D. in chemical engineering), but the book was just way too over the top for any not intimately familiar with quantum physics. The book contains a lot of interesting information, but it is sandwiched between some very difficult concepts and nomenclature. Remember, ""know your audience . . ."""
1,The Other Me's Read It and Liked It I think,"it seems that in one of the multiverses that surround me like a fog these days, another 'Me' has already read this book. What seems to bug this other 'Me' about the book, is the tacit assumption that such superpositions are *never* experienced in the 'classical' world. Well, jeez, what else is schizophrenia all about, eh? And if you read some of the old Zen Master anecdotes, they are clearly talking about living in a world of superposition, where 'to go one mile east, is to go one mile west'. What we need is for Thomas Cleary to have a go at doing a syncretic synthesis of Zen and Physics. It's about time for a newer 'Tao of Physics' it seems to me!"
2,Big Disappointment,"There's nothing I love more than a good ghost story or a complex intertwining plot, but this book really let me down. I read all these great reviews and was excited to read it. I'm not even sure why someone tagged it as ""scary"" because there is nothing scary about it. When I started reading this book I discovered that the book is written on such a surface level, that you never feel any emotion toward the characters or events, and the description is so lacking, that I felt that I was reading a book written by a high school student (no offense to high school students). If you choose to read it, be prepared for a light-fluff read, a no-brainer."
1,"If you like good literature, don't read this book","When I started to read this book, I noticed the characters were very ""flat"" and the story is painfully predictable. The writing is poor as there were some very obvious spelling and grammar errors that were very annoying. In addition, the story was not well developed and about halfway through the book I almost called it quits. However, I wanted to see if there was a point to it and decided to give it a chance. I'm sorry I did. If you are a fan of Stephen King or Dean Koontz, please do not read this book because you will be even more disappointed. Unfortunately, the ""horror"" genus is not as prevalent as it was in the 1980s, but, if you are looking for a good thriller try some of the books by Douglas Preston."
3,Had higher expectations,"As the title indicated, I had higher expectations based upon the other 5 star reviews. This book is good, but not worthy of 5 stars.I will state the concept is fascinating. The implementation was lacking due to the following areas.I find it difficult to believe as a police officer from the street that Daniel has lost all his street smarts and analytical ability.Daniel's relationship with Rosie was a bit too quick to have all those gushing feelings.I felt Michael's character was far better written and enjoyed his role and his growth experience in the book.The book is a worthwhile read, but having read the other glowing reviews, my expectations where higher."
2,Naaah,"If you are looking for a book that reveals details about Russian Orthodoxy OR one which is spiritually inspiring, you can skip this particular work. The writer is of that brand of faith in which how she feels is the determining element, and hence the narrative is mostly boring. She doesn't feel much interesting."
2,Solar battery is marginal,"The solar battery circuit for this watch is marginal; if you don't expose the watch to a lot of light every day, either sunlight or artificial, this watch will go blank at odd times, so you're without the Time, or it will die all together and require several hours ""charging"" before it can be used aain. I do not reccomend buying this watch. Instead of opting for a more expensive solar watch, that hopefully works, I bought a 10 year battery life Casio as a relacement, that hopefully will be last a long time."
2,WS-3610 E-IRKSOME,I was happy to receive the WS-3610 as a gift and excited to install it and receive data on the display. I was extremely dismayed NOT to be able download and create history data files on my purely USB enabled laptop PC. I emailed the makers of HeavyWeather Pro a couple of times about the issue and was extremely dismayed NOT to get ANY response. I bought a rs232 to USB adaptor and a pin reverser allowing me to download one line of weather data to a HeavyWeather Pro display template on my laptop. However the HeavyWeather Pro is not written well enough to allow building history.dat files. IRKSOME!!!!!
1,Lousy display and Amazon return policy make this a BAD CHOICE,"I had reviewed a number of Weather stations and decided that the LaCrosse 3610 was a good unit at a fair price and ordered one from Amazon. After I set it up I found the LCD display almost unuseable due to the extremely low contrast. I contacted Amazon who suggested I contact the Mfgr., who said that there was nothing that I could do to improve it except to return it to Amazon for another unit. In the meantime 30 days passed and when I contacted Amazon (you leave your no. and they call you back), they said that I would not receive the full amount back, even if I asked for a direct replacement it would cost me 15% of the purchase price. Obviously not a very reputable co. to deal with - I do not recommend this product or buying anything from Amazon that might need to be returned."
4,Who Knew Freddie Was So Mad????,"This is a hardcore, in your face , this is the truth if you don't like it listen to something else , subtly shocking,rock-funk affair delivered with passionate , but sometimes over the top vocals by Cree Summer. I LOVE Cree Summer but one might get the impression that Cree is singing TOO hard like she has something to prove. That's why her next cd( 1999's [ASIN:B00138H92A Street Farie]] is so brilliant; she toned it down. Nevertheless, the songs are very catchy, memorable, the musicianship is kick ass, the in your face honesty is what gives the cd it's appeal and Cree Summer is a force to be reckoned with .She sings with so much heart and passion, to quote another reviewer, El Kabong, you have to press play and then DUCK! Who knew Elmyra was so Freaking angry?? My personal favs are: Someone Like U , Brand New Day , and Just A thought, Beauty is made, Artificial Evolution , and Only Color. Cree kicks much ass."
1,Returned this book immediately,"If you are preparing for touring, you are surely familiar with the most elementary, basic elements of fitness and cycling that this book covers. The content is superficial at best and often appears hastily prepared. I bought this book in the morning at a local bookstore and returned it in the afternoon, it's simply that terrible."
4,Excellent performance,"Well documented footage featuring many of the superstars that put British rock on the map.The camera work is par excellence,as is the audio quality, not to mention some rousing high energy performances. The finale, featuring a jam on the classic ""Layla"", with guitarists Beck and Clapton trading licks is fierce and on the cutting edge."
5,"Soothe & Cool Skin Cream Tube, 2 oz, or 8oz.",Less than one month ago I had a complete knee replacement and was given a tube of the aformentioned to use on the third day before I was transfer to a Physical Therapy Hospital.. It's immediately sootheing. I have very dry skin and was surprized how quickly my skin adjusted to being streached larger for the replacement knee under the skin. It immediately promoted healing the scar. They used staples. Was able to remove the staples quickly and healing has been very successful. I used it down the leg on exzema from dry skin. Skin is clear of any sign signs of exzema. I will continue to use the product. Excellant!! Gala Parker
2,NOT AS ILLUSTRATED,"I ordered 2 of these rosette heads for my watering cans. The illustrationdepicts a head with a copper top. Apparently, they like to misrepresenttheir product. Of the 2 heads I received only one would screw onto thespout, the other too small. The label on the rosette said Made in Mexico.I know at one time Dover Products were quality products. Most of the oldercans you run into today have rusted out heads. It would be nice to seesomeone make a nice quality replacement rosette head. Perhaps, too much toask though."
5,Galvanized Sprinkler,We have gone through a few of theese over the years that were NOT galvanized. This should last us for the rest of our days.
2,poor quality,"The one you show is brass, I got a galvanized one, not the same quality. Will not order again and you need to change your pic a false representation."
2,Not as pictured,"Not a bad watering can head... but smaller than it should be, and it's not brass like in the picture. Its galvanized and I'm ok with that, but the advertising is legally obligated to represent the product. They did not. Your old one is probably just as good if not better, if you enlarge the holes with an ice pick or small drill bit."
1,Infinity PS210,"A great Subwoofer for the price.Got it to upgrade my older Bose system 10.The small cube speakers sound great to me, but the bass was never quite strong enough. (bass is not adjustable on earlier models) It really makes quite a difference.I should have done it sooner.Even tho the grill shows silver, it is black. Just right........................................................... Update Oct 10 2011 Sorry.. The sub is dead.Its in an authorised repair shop that wants more than the original cost. Ordered a polk psw-505 12 inch for $10.00 more than a repair.Its not in production,but neither is the 210.See how bad the 210 is (dead after warrenty) by checking reviews at crutchfield.com Wish I knew that 3 yrs ago."
2,Good only for movies.,"I've own this sub for a year then sold it @ Craigs list. The sound is great for movies as you can feel as well as hear the rumbling bass but then... It lacks the tonal sound, and muddy when it comes to music."
2,SUperfund is superboring,This book was excessively boring and tedious with implementation strategies.I should know bc one of the authors is my teacher and he is the exact same way.do not read this book
3,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS....,I thought this was just going to be showing Haunted Houses all around the US but it was a lot of other boring crap that just didn't interest me at all. I LOVE HALLOWEEN and splurged on this because I love seeing the inside of Haunted Houses. It did show some but not enough...It seems like OLD footage not like the ones on TV that show during Halloween that are more up to date. I would send it back if I could.
4,Good product for the price,The RhinoPRO 1000 is a great device. It is constructed well and fits in your hand nicely. The quality of the labels is excellent and they seem like they'll be durable over time. Very easy to get started with and use.I'm reserving the fifth star for two reasons.1. The keys are organized sub-optimally2. Device does waste some stock at the beginning and end of the labelPrint your labels side-by-side at once with an extra space between them to offset problem number 2.
2,"Works OK, but too much head waste and label is expensive to buy","Not a good package: there is no way to reduce the head waste. You print out just a letter M, but you need 1.5inch of label: ridiculous! Also, you will have to pay $16+ for one box of label, which is only 3 meter long.Long-term use is very expensive!Buy the Brother one, you will pay the same dollars for one box of label, but it is 9 meter long. Also, it says it has less head waste. Let's see."
2,GREAT PHOTOS,"Book was more of a phamplet (5"" x 7"" in size and 30 pages long). Did include some great photos however."
4,Introductory Bach Harpsichord Recital,"This is an introductory Bach harpsichord recital: introductory to Bach's keyboard music, and to Celine Frisch who is described by the label as one of the best new young musicians.The highlights of this CD, for me, are the C Major Prelude and Fugue from Book II of the Well Tempered Clavier, and the French Suite #5. The Toccata in D is good; the English Suite #3 is average. The other piece she does, a Suite, seems sort of a filler.I'd like to hear her some more. She seems promising.Good quality sound."
2,This isn't Jitterbug,"I bought this tape because I wanted to learn more about East Coast Swing/Jitterbug, what I got was a beginning Lindy Hop tape called How to Jitterbug. If you're looking to get started with swing dancing, then it's a good tape, but if you're looking specifically for Jitterbug, then look elsewhere."
5,A good overview of Vedanta,"Vedanta is another name of Hinduism. The basic teaching of Vedanta is that man is inherently Divine and Free. It is a delusion that makes man feel impure, bound and limited. Thus the voice of Vedanta is a clarion call to manifestation of the Divinity and Freedom to which we truly are heirs. Swami Vivekananda was the first Indian in modern times to effetively spread this message in the West. This book contains a brilliant compilation from Swami Vivekananda's lectures, writings and letters. The book is compiled by Swami Chetanananda, a senior monk of the Sri Ramakrishna Order, which was founded by Swami Vivekananda. The book is well organized. The language is very clear and forceful. The book is a very good introduction to anyone who is interested in Indian Philosophy and Religion, especially Hinduism, ie. Vedanta. Readers who are already in touch with Hinduism will get their ideas much more clearer and well organized by reading this book."
3,A Good Movie,"Not a great movie. Not a five-star classic that I'm going to watch again and again. Not what I'd expect to win all the awards it has. But it's good. It's better than the summary on the back of the DVD made me think it would be. Funny in places, acted well, written well. Some unusual plot lines, and I like unusual. So as I say, it's a good movie."
2,Pretentious b.s.,"Who would believe that such characters exist in real life? In the writer's too obvious effort to assign an unusual and distinctive trait or to each character, he has only succeeded in making them non-stereotypical, but nonetheless flat and incredible.It is ironic that a film called ""The Five Senses"" is as dead as some of the characters in it. That goes for the directorial treatment too. Very uninvolved and detached. The only sensual image here is the opening scene. That's it."
3,Kansas City Massicure,"The Kansas City Massacre was the shootout and murder of four law enforcement officers and a criminal fugitive at the Union Station railroad depot in Kansas City, Missouri on the morning of June 17, 1933. According the official FBI report, the Kansas City Massacre occurred as the result of the attempt by Charles ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd, Vernon Miller, and Adam Richetti to free their friend, Frank Nash, a federal prisoner. At the time, Nash was in the custody of several law enforcement officers who were returning him to the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, from which he had escaped three years earlier. However all of the men alleged to be involved denied involvement. Floyd, in particular, went so far as to write a newspaper denying involvement in the massacre."
1,Words fail me...,"This movie is breathtaking. I've never seen anything so abysmal in my life. I'm gobsmacked. Read the other reviews of this...thing. They're not exaggerated. I feel like I've somehow been violated. I'll tell you I didn't watch the whole thing - I couldn't - about every ten minutes I'd feel a psychotic episode crawl slowly from the depths of my subconscious like some mutant octopus reaching for my ill-fated ship of reason and I would change the channel, craving commercials until the psychosis passed. When I was stable and no longer a threat to myself or others, I would brave another ten minutes of this thing, only to have to surface once more. What can I say of this experience? Only this: I have a kind of sublime reassurance now, a serenity not unlike that described by others who have had near-death experiences. I know that the most traumatic moment of my life is behind me, and I am stronger for it."
2,You never see the Octopus,This was a horrible Science fiction film. You never see or hear about the octopus till the end of the movie. And the only time the octopus is worth watching is towards the last 15 minutes of the movie. However the monster is well created so I had to give this film at least 2 stars.
1,Could it be any worse?,"The writer much dislike the Navy and the CIA, The CIA agent would have to be the worst in the world. The Navy personal as payed in this movie are anything but what real Navy men are. Real Navy men on Submarines well disciplined and very brave not the undisciplined and cowards as pro-trade in this movie. If I could I would rate this movie a BIG MINUS 10 I would and do"
3,Not bad but not good,"What a shame. This movie started so incredible, the whole russian sub scene was so good I couldn't keep my eyes off it. I really liked it alot, but from there it starts to go down. I didn't mind the United Embassy stuff but it seems that it is the main focus rather than the Octopus. This would of been better if there were more attacks on ships, if the Octopus is that big you can't expect it to kill people so why not make it destroy big things but it doesn't do that, instead we are stuck with just one sub, which was boring at times. I didn't mind the characters at times I felt them and at others I didn't. This is definitely one of Nu Images better movies in terms of emotions but they could of made this into a great movie."
2,Wet women and hungry cephalopods,"Cross over stories, each that could not stand on its own go down together. We get treated to an opening scene of a submarine fight. Then we get to see some old lady leave a suspicious bag off at a CIA outpost. This leads to a submarine mission to retrieve a bad guy and it will soon cross over a strange location where many ships have disappeared. We have the standard clichÃ© characters. Of course the bed guy is extra bad and the girl is extra sexy and the others are dumb and dumber.After turning into the formula ""it's going to eat us all""So do they all get eaten one by one like bon-bons?Or does everyone have calamari for life?"
3,Saw it on Sci-Fi.,"Octopus is just another one of those ""horror"" movies where an animal somehow changes into a gigantic monster. This movie is not the least bit scary. But it is...entertaining. I agree with the past review, the acting did kind of [stinks]. And the plot was a bit far-fetched. You should only get this if you like big things, or just watch it on TV. I enjoyed it, but it could've been waaaaaaay better."
4,BRILL,THIS MOVIE IS GREAT GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS GOOD ACTION GOOD PLOT MUST BUY NOWP.S SEQUEL IS POOR CASH IN NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS ONE
4,Good boot....,This is a stylish boot that is pretty comfortable. They could use a tad more arch support for my feet. They are well-made. Good boot for the price.
1,Gasket breaks after 24-hrs - don't recommend!!!,"I've gone through all six of these stupid things, all of the gaskets break overnight, just use the cork your wine came with."
1,Pathetic,"Don't waste your time or money on this one. Low quality, don't work well. I have owned many of these products in the past and they all worked fine. Not so with this brand."
1,Don't work with glass bottles,"The rubber expansion ring that is supposed to engage the inside neck of the bottle doesn't expand enough and/or expands irregularly. So it doesn't stay in place or seal the bottle. If there is any pressure in the bottle, e.g., soda, it completely or partially pops out. Even without pressure, it doesn't seal. Other kinds of level stoppers work, but these don't."
1,Don't bother!,These lever caps lasted all of about two months before they broke. Don't waste your money!
5,feedback,Great follow up concerning their product. Product was as advertised and customer care was A++.
1,Pitiful,Weak. Too Small. rubber comes right off. Waste of money. Going back to other brand. This is a terrible cork.
2,Not durable.,"I bought a pair of these stoppers for use in wine and beer bottles. They worked well initially, but both broke within a few months."
5,book review,"The thanksgiving treasure, by Gail Rock is about two people who are enemies for about two years. In the story a girl tries to get her father to be friends with his enemy. But instead of him becoming friends with the enemy his child becomes friends with her fathers enemy. This part of the story takes place before Thanksgiving happens. Then on Thanksgiving the girl wants to invite her dad's enemy to dinner but her dad says no. So she decides to take him Thanksgiving dinner which might be his last. When a man came to the girl's house he told her that her dad's enemy had left her a horse. The father didn't want the horse but the girl wanted it. There is another book that is a sequel to the Thanksgiving Treasure, that Gail Rock has done it is called the Christmas Tree. I liked the Thanksgiving Treasure because it teaches people that you could be friends with your enemies."
3,"Easy to read and take along,","This is a simple to understand guide book, but I also have ""iPod, The Missing Manual"" and it is my preferred choice of the two."
4,Great set for the price,I bought these to use with our built-in fire pit on our paver patio. They work well and my 4 year old son likes to roast marshmallows with them. My only complaint is that I wish the shorter forks were a bit longer (4-6 inches would be great) because my son has trouble reaching the flames sometimes if the fire is low (and I don't really want a 4 year old too close to the fire). The longer ones are a bit too long for him. We've used the multi-dog basket fork to cook four brats at a time and it worked really well. The set seems pretty sturdy and well made.The forks all arrived with safety tips on them to keep from poking you when opening the package. We keep them on when storing the forks for the safety of the small children in our house.I'm pleased with this set and think we will have it for many years to come.
3,So-So,"Good quality. The hot dog holder didn't work as well as i had hoped. Next time i will just buy non-collapsible long 32"" sticks.the short sticks are too short. i don't want my kids getting that close to the fire pit in our backyard.the only sticks in this set that i like are the long wooden handle ones."
5,Fantastic!,"I bought these as for the family's new fireplace. The ""kids"" (all grownups now) were thrilled! We have used them on several occasions for Smores, etc. Surprisingly strong metal and seemingly very well constructed. We are delighted with these! Would highly recommend these, but caution.. the tips are fairly sharp!Rome's Set of 9 Forks for Marshmallows and Hot Dogs, Chrome Plated Steel"
5,Perfect for he Beach,"Great for roasting hot dogs or making Smores, this is the best set I've seen. They are high quality materials, very sturdy and functional. The extra long ones are great for large fires. Colored handles for the grandkids keeps things in order. They clean easily in the sand until you can get then home for a wash. No marshmellow goo in the car."
1,He is the man,Anything by this awesome person and blues giant is the best. Whether you see him live or listen to any of his CD's he get's it done righteously.GUARANTEED GOOD..... :)>
5,Getting Word to work for you,"My experience with this book shows Amazon's strength. Having read the other reviews, I purchased this book, and found that it more than fulfilled my expectations. It has a simple way of doing pseudo-hypertext with Word. It tells what works, what doesn't, and what work-arounds to use to get Word to work for you.Without Amazon.com, I would never have found this excellent resource among the dozens of books on Word and WordBasic. Highly recommended."
5,Great book for anyone struggling with Word's programming,This is the only book I've found that makes programming Word understandable. The biggest stumbling block to programming in Word is not knowing what the terms are. I was very frustrated (as a programmer for 20+years) because there was no place to find what the elements were in a consistent fashion. Woody's book solved this! Projects that would take days (head scratching to figure out how to find what I needed)are now done in minutes. Only one problem with the book: WE NEED A WORD 97 VERSION!!!
2,Great Artist - Emply Sound,"I recently purchased this CD and I was shocked at the flat sound of the music. The bass is not there and the overall sound is empty and brassy. I created MP3 files from the CD and EQ'd them in ""Abobe Audition"" and got a better sound but it still lacked fidelity. MCA is ripping off their customers with this product. I have an LP copy of this album that sounds much better than this CD. I have owned the LP since it came out in 1979."
5,barbra underated,"barbra mandrell, great voice, for country fans, or people who enjoy good music, wont be disappointed.she is underated."
3,Good collection of hits,"This 1979 release showcases the best from Barbara Mandrell between the years of 1975-1978. Her mega-hit ""Sleeping Single in a Double Bed"" is included. This CD showcases Barbara's wide range from soulful R&B on ""Woman To Woman"" to the tear-jerking ""That's What Friends Are For."" Other highlights of this CD include ""Standing Room Only"" and ""Married, But Not To Each Other."" A good place for first-time Mandrell listeners to start, it shows the best of one of the performers who helped pave the way for the artists like Shania Twain and Trisha Yearwood."
1,Horrible 1st episode,"I only watched the first episode and barely made it through. I've never seen a more obvious plot in my life. Not only is the plot week, but the acting is poor, especially the supporting cast. Since this show gets so much good buzz, maybe it gets better as the season progresses, but then again, 2 and Half Men gets good reviews and it is mindless drivel."
2,Wrong Lead,"Good scripts but the lead actress, whos been really great in other roles, isnt suited for this role. Her supporting cast isnt strong either."
4,Season One - The Closer,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first season of The Closer. It started off kinda slow; however, as the season progressed you found yourself really getting into the characters. I am really looking forward to getting Season Two."
4,"Charming, quirky lead","I agree with another reviewer who saw the similarity to LO:CI. KSedgewick gives her character a strange, mannered way of talking and gesturing. She still manages to be lovable and instead of becoming a laughing stock, her interrogation skill gradually wins over her underlings. The supporting cast is top notch too. Also a big cheer for having an integrated racial cast."
4,Great show to bad there are no English Subtitles,I really enjoyed this first season except for the fact that there are no English Subtitles. I don't want to miss what the actors are saying and I end up turning the speakers extra loud to hear what is going on. This extra volume does not make me popular if there are other family members in the house not watching the show.I am not hearing impaired but I would bet a lot of hearing impaired customers would buy in to this great show if it had English subtitles. There is a lot of conversation going on. Unfortunately sometimes I just miss much of what the actors are saying to each other.For a great show like this you don't want to miss out on any dialogue. Almost every DVD I watch always has English Subtitles. I think they dropped the ball on this one. (Too bad)What blows me away is that Season One offers subtitles in two other languages but not English. That's my rant.
5,terrific,"Everything about this series is well done; writing, directing, acting, etc. The cast works well together and you want to get to know them better. Oh yeah, and the stories are usually interesting, too!"
5,Love this show.,Love this show. Miss that it's over. Glad to be able to watch the show from the very beginning starting with season one and working my way towards the finale.
5,One of the best shows around,I think this show is very well written and the cast is fantastic. I have been watching this since it came out on television and am re-watching on Prime. It is just as good the second time around. Great Show! Glad its on Prime!
5,the closer,"from the usa to australia in no time flat, I love the current exchange rate, makes buying much easier"
1,Fake Accent,"I can't get past the terrible accent of Kyra. Difficult to give the main character credibility when you can't believe she is who she pretends to be. Overacts, almost a comedic farce.The dialog is well written, Just poor casting."
4,"If you're a fan of the closer, Watch This!","This is the very first episode of The Closer. It's very interesting to see what the characters are like in this first episode vs. what they're like in current episodes. Among other things, Kyra Sedgwick has a different accent and is more aggressive in this show. Plus this is the first time the characters meet up with Brenda Johnson, and that presents some interesting situations."
5,Great First Season,"When I first saw The Closer I didn't like it. Somehow I got hooked -- and decided to order the first season to see how it all started and am glad I did. Their cast has somebody for everyone -- young, old, ethnic -- a pleasant change."
4,The Closer - The Complete First Season,"What a wonderful cast. I love the way all their personalities, character assets and flaws are shared throughout the season. The stories are well thought out.I really enjoyed season one. I have also seen season two and am looking forward to watching season three."
4,Good show but no english captions.,I started watching with the third season. The first eposode DVD explained several plot items I was curious about - for example why she was hired as deputy chief (only options were that post or recruit).
5,Great,"The Closer with Keira Sedgewick as Deputy Chief of LA's special force is a wonderful ensemble performance with humor, quirkiness, character development and mystery. I look forward to each episode and am never disappointed in the casts' performance. I highly recommend this series. Well done and thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Disc Issues,"I love the Closer, however two out of the four discs couldn't be read in my player. Luckily I could watch them on my laptop or I would have had to return it. The Closer dvd's I purchased in the store work fine. Amazon is a lower price, bear in mind the discs may not work."
4,The Kyra Sedgwick show.,"A fairly traditional cop show, lit up by the brilliance of Kyra Sedgwick. The supporting cast is good, sometimes great, but anyone who loves this show has in point of fact fallen for Kyra. Or is it Brenda Johnson, the well drawn, superbly realized character, she brings to life with such nuanced verve? It's not a groundbreaking show, and stays a little too safely middle of the road in this HBO era of TV, but there's nothing to dislike here. It might not be great, but it's really very good. And what's wrong with that?"
4,Good watch,Enjoy watching this show. Received the first season free through Amazon Prime.I'm not so sure I'll pay for the following seasons though.
3,"closer, 1st season",the first disc in this first season set skips. Not sure if it is my dvd player or the disc.
4,"I like the quirky nature of the main character in the series, Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson","Good drama series with the main ingredient being the quirky nature of the main character in the series, Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson."
4,tv at its best,a combination of good writing and excellent acting make this show compelling to watch. it is just as entertaining the second time around.
3,"great series, lousy DVDs","I have this set in hand, and I'm quite disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the show is great, but the DVD leaves something to be desired. This program was shown in widescreen originally, and that's the way it is presented here, but not anamorphically enhanced. That means that people with 16:9 monitors will see black bars on the sides as well as the top and bottom. They really blew it with that. :( The show gets 5 stars, but this DVD treatment brings the rating down to three."
1,THE CLOSER COMPLETE FIRST SEASON,I AM GREATLT DISAPPOINTED THAT THE DVD'S DID NOT HAVE CLOSED CAPTIONS AS I HAVE A HEARING DISABILITY AND THE DVD'S ARE WORTHLESS TO ME. IF I HAD KNOW THAT THERE WAS NO CLOSED CAPTIONS I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THEM.
5,Strong Female Boss,I't great to see a strong but feminine female character in a role of authority. Too often women are the victims in crime shows.
5,The Closer: A Complete First Season Hit,"I was delighted to have the entire first season of this smart new drama on two CDs. ""The Closer"" is one of those rare, intelligent shows (like ""Law and Order"") whose episodes can be enjoyed over and over again without broadcast interruptions. I am already anxious to get the ""complete"" Second Season! If you are a fan, this is a ""must have"" set!"
4,Quality Show Right From the Beginning,"The first season of The Closer is a great deal of exposition woven throughout the various cases the squad has to deal with. Sharp, humorous and intriguging with a brilliantly assembled ensemble. I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys procedural mysteries."
4,The Closer Season 1,I like the program. The drama of a police chief coupled with the drama of starting a new life in a strange city.
5,Great Entertainment,My husband and I love this series. We enjoy watching them together. Was very sorry to see it end but understand why they did.
4,Great,I bought this for a friend that loves the show but is never awake at 10 PM to watch it. It was a great gift and has me thinking about buying other TV shows. It's also nice to watch the DVD's without commericals.
3,"show gets a 5, DVDs get a 0","I agree with the other fans who love this show but are displeased with the DVDs. This is one of my favorite shows, and it is very disappointing to get DVDs that aren't in anamorphic widescreen. I'm annoyed to have paid money to get DVDs with a lower picture quality than what I can see broadcast on HDTV. The sound quality is also not very good."
3,Prime Suspect - American Style,"The pilot was enjoyable but it would have been nice if they acknowledged that this was based upon the ""Prime Suspect"" series from the BBC. Helen Mirren did an incredible job as Inspector Jane Tennyson. It's definitely worth checking out!"
5,Wonderful Cookbook,"This is a wonderful cookbook. It is easy to follow, authentic, and has lots of pictures. There are also some recipies that are similar to old family recipies I have."
4,Synopsis,"Matthew, writing to another Jew who is not a believer, gives his account of Jesus' birth, ministry, death and resurection in order to prove Him the Messiah, the fulfillment of God's promise. Scenes contrast the faith of those who believed Emmanuel had come, and those who did not. We are encouraged to believe in Him."
3,Beginners dog training book,"I will be purchasing a doberman in the near future so I purchased this book because it looked to have specific training guidelines for the doberman breed. I was disappointed because all of the tips and techniques were of the general variety and didn't address the tempermental or behavioral aspects of the doberman (it refers you to the breed clubs). It is published nicely in high gloss with great photos. As far as content, I read it in one hour and probably won't go back to it. I gave it 3 stars because it was under $10."
2,How To Train Your Doberman Pinscher,"The title of this book led me to believe it was about specifically training the Doberman...I was highly disappointed to find it covered more about general info of dogs and of the breed that I've already purchased and read in other books. In purchasing this book, I wouldn't have thought the 94 pages would include how to purchase a dog - rather that you already own a Doberman and wanted specific info on the behaviors and training hints specifically for this very smart breed."
1,Not so great,I didn't think this book was very useful. It was like a childrens picture book. The training information can be found in other books that cost much less and contain a lot more information.
5,Everything you need to know,"This book covers all of the significant information a new Doberman purchaser might need to know. It is focussed towards the new pet owner that has only limited knowledge and experience in raising and training a new Doberman. I read a number of Doberman and training books before I bought my dog and this is the one I keep coming back to time and time again, particularly during the dogs first year. It is quite concise and so it is also the one I give to other family members who only want the key information in an easy to read form."
3,"OK popcorn, generic seems to be just as good",I bought a big box of these from Amazon. The popcorn is OK but I could not tell the difference between this popcorn and the generic from Walmart.In other words it tasted about the same.
2,Disorganized and scattered,Used for a 1st year introductory Sanskrit course. The book is poorly organized and haphazard. I ended up using only the homework questions. There are lots of helpful Sanskrit grammar and sandhi websites. The only redeeming quality is the glossary.
4,good quality for used books,"one book had a spot on one page, but overall good quality for used books. Overall, I am satisfied with the books."
4,What does it mean?,"The director answers this at the end of his commentary by saying: never ask. He doesn't want you to wonder what this art film really means because it can be taken at a number of levels. I liked the moody, subdued soundtrack and the cinematography, of course, is brilliant. Is everyone in Japan this depressed, you wonder?"
4,WOW!!,"I LOVED this movie. The casting is EXCELLENT and Tadanobu Asano's performance is outstanding as usual. There's a funny cameo appearance by Takashi Miike as one of the yakuza. And of course, the cinematography by Christopher Doyle is SUPERB. I would definitely recommend this movie 100%. A definite must for all movie lovers."
2,Not enough substance to justify trying to connect it together,"Poetic? Possibly, but disconnected and pretty boring - and fashionably 'minimalist'. An obsessive, fastidious and reclusive young Japanese man, Kenji, living in Thailand, perpetually contemplates and often attempts suicide - seemingly with ultimate success. He meets a wild and disorderly Thai girl, Noi, and sits around her for most of the movie - despite Noi's several vain attempts to initiate sex. There is a sub-plot, in which a nest of gangsters kill one another and, for good measure, try several times (unfortunately without managing it) to kill Kenji. This movie is brought to a merciful conclusion by her departure for Japan and his arrest. It takes a smarter man than me to make much sense of this pretentious waste of film, which in some ways recalls the genre of Alain Resnais' ""Last Year in Marienbad"". I suppose I am just not into deeply-hidden meanings, because it has received almost universal rave reviews."
5,Wonderful Insight into Human Mind,"Brookner creates a fascinating window into the interior monologues of human beings, particularly women. In Fanny you can see all the ways one can mentally reformat their experiences to try and make them more tolerable. You also see how practiced one can become at forgiving instead of becoming angry, and how we may not always be paying attention to those who really love us."
2,Tiresome,"(Can I say it without sounding sexist? I suppose not.) Yet another self-loathing woman author with a feminist axe to grind.A good author with tremendous control over her art form, but tiresome nevertheless. The main character is so self absorbed that everything else is barely two dimentional.I'd much prefer Alice Munroe for a protrail of individuals and relationships with depth and solidity. Someone who understands [or tries to] the world beyond herself.Brookner never opens the door, not to let heself out or to let others in."
5,These are the best baby bowls!!,"Not only are these the cutest baby bowls (cute, vibrant colors) but the lids snap on so easily. Once the lid snaps on, it won't fall off (unlike the Gerber baby bowls where you can never tell if the lid is on right until you find out cereal or whatever has leaked all over your diaper bag!). It is especially a necessity for traveling!! 3 bowls are just not enough, I would get at least 2 of these and no other brand of baby bowls!"
1,Bad Phone,"Reception is acceptable. Caller ID window is very small and the text font in it is incredibly small. After four months the speaker starting going in and out during every call. Sometimes the speaker would go out for a couple minutes at a time. Now I'm back buying another phone, not GE this time."
1,Garbage,"This phone was horrible, the earpiece doesn't even fit. There is so much static on this phone even when you change channels. Spend a little more money and get a quality cordless phone."
4,SEAMS TO WORK GREAT,I have a good opinion of this phone. It is a good deal for th eprice. Not so comfortable for long periods of time though.
2,This bucket does not hold water,"Luckily I did not buy this bucket to hold water, however if you are buying this as a water bucket look elsewhere."
3,A bit disappointed,"I have been using this style Rubbermaid mat for years, I checked all the local stores, but couldn't find this model, so I was thrilled when I located it on Amazon, but I am really disappointed, they changed the style, and quality of the mat. It isn't the same quality product it used to be, and I see i'm not the only one who feels this way, I wonder what prompted Rubbermaid to lower their quality standards."
3,Animorphs #43-- The Test,"It seems that a Yeerk named Taylor has come back to the Animorphs. She was, by the way, a Yeerk who once enslaved Tobias. But instead of evil deeds this time, she wants Tobias to help overthrowing Visser Three, leader of the Yeerk invasion on Earth. Should the Animorphs join her plan? Or is she to suspicious as a Yeerk? Find out in Animorphs #43, The Test!"
2,skip it,"In this book, Tobias and Ax morph taxxons to put natrul gas in the Yeerk pool. Taylor, a Controller says she's part of the Peace Movment and she comes up w/ the idea. It's really boring. Normaly Tobias books are good, but this one is horrible."
2,Doesnt look like Barbie anymore...,"...but more like a doll sized version of a mix between Jessica Simpson and Pamela Anderson. I am a big barbie fan and I love the things they have done with their great eras collection or the Hollywood one and Pop culture etc, but every now and then, you come across a doll like this which just looks like you had taken the head of some lame bimbo startlet, shrank it and attached to Barbie's body. This one looks fake...it's like opening up playboy and seeing Pam Anderson or Paris Hilton clothed for once. Look at that face-mold and the eyes. Yuk. Theme Barbies aside, but a Barbie still should look like a Barbie. I'd say, stick with the original or the really pretty collector ones."
5,Plain English Formula for Creating Wealth,"I enjoyed Tanous's previous book, Investment Gurus, and this one lives up to what I would expect from him. Tanous speaks plain English and, unlike so many others, doesn't over-promise. Here is a formula for creating wealth in an intelligent, easy to follow, way which takes into account one's personal profile. I loved taking the test and learning what I was really like as an investor! The advice is sound, the writing is conversational, and I came away feeling like I had finally learned something which I could use to reach my goals on the stock market. Highly recommended!"
5,Amazingly Helpful Book,"I am so happy to have found this book. It really breaks through the false notions we all entertain about a punishing and menacing God which sustains our suffering because somehow we feel we deserved it or incurred God's wrath. NOT SO!!! Michele Longo O'Donnell has blessed us with this beautiful presentation of God's eternal love, a God who never sends us sickness, suffering, problems, unhappiness, or bad things but only is unchanging love and mercy and forgiveness. So we can begin to release the false hold all this misery has on us and on all mankind. A treasure to read and give as a gift!"
4,Is that all there is?,"No,NO there is so much more. We have put GOD in a box. Michele is going to help you to demolish your ""God Box"".Should be read by all who want more of God. Unconventional? Yes! Don't try to find her books in conventional Christian Bookstores."
3,Hidden value,"This book has a helpful message that gets overshadowed by the ""creative theology"" and undocumented Bible quotations the author uses to justify that message. I suspect that many will trash the book without getting the message. Read it carefully so you don't miss it. Gerry"
3,Okay book,"This philosophy removes godliness from god. Did not hate the book, but did not finish it, either. Buy if you must."
4,Review,"Great service and product. I got it in less than 2 days. Intact, new, excellent conditions. Caliper is OK and accurate. Not the best but does the work pretty well. Great advantage to have inches and millimeters in the same dial. 2 in 1. I`m very satisfied. I totally recommend this product and it's seller."
2,Very Dissapointed.,"After the first class at University, it was agreed that we will abandon this book and try to work with handouts from various sources. Avoid at all costs and asve your money!"
4,Bottom Line - the Soul Survives,"this book on reincarnation is an interesting examination of the author's journey to belief in reincarnation and the Jewish sources supporting it (gilgul neshamot). Some parts are repetitive, and he seems a bit defensive about coming to his belief, but overall kept me reading on a topic that isn't discussed very often."
5,"Does the Soul Survive: A Jewish Journey to Belief in Afterlife, Past Lives & Living With a Purpose",This book enlightened me. I have always believed in reincarnation. I did not know that my roots did too.This is a very well written book with lots of examples of people in our time having previous life examples. Things have a way of coming up in this life time that was left over from a previous life time. As an example some health issues occur in this life time because of problems in a previous life time.I highly recommend this book to anyone that has doubts about reincarnation.
4,A winning movie,This movie is based on the life of Grover Cleveland Alexander who was from South Central Nebraska. I personally am from the same area and really enjoyed hearing the names of some of the small local towns in our area on a movie. Ronald Reagan and Doris Day were great and the movie is fun to watch.
3,3.5 stars. A decent air pistol with room for improvement.,"I've had one of these for years now, and I've been pretty happy with it, for the most part.The gun shoots fast, which is nice if you're trying to build skills for combat shooting. The trigger is decent, it's not difficult to fire double action, and single action is available if you prefer. The grips are very comfortable as well.The biggest drawback is the crappy sights. The front blade is much too thin and it makes it difficult aquire the front sight or aim the weapon properly. This is the sort of weapon that needs a good high-visibility sight. I'd even prefer a fixed sight with easy to see sights than the fine adjustment sights on this gun. A combat style gun like this doesn't need adjustable sights; it needs fast-shooting sights. Target sights belong on target pistols.If the sights were better I'd give this 5 stars. But the existing sights bring the usability down quite a bit."
3,60's production mars Nina,"Nina Simone was a unique treasure as both a great pianist and a great singer. She produced many fantastic recordings, of which my favorite isWild Is The Wind / High Priestess Of Soul. But this ""Ellington"" CD is nearly unlistenable due to the horrible backup singers that were layered on to the recordings afterwards. Avoid this one."
2,poor information,"The CD I selected was NOT the one I wanted. There was NO listing of the song titles on the sales info.I had purchased the album many years ago and thought that this was that Great album, it is NOT. Only the title was.Its my fault, Iaccept responsibility.There should be a title list of songs."
5,Pure Magic!,"Roy Rogers is the best slide guitar player you will ever hear, and Norton Buffalo gives the harmonica more dimension than the entire string section of a symphony orchestra. These are two masterful musicians at the top of their form. R&B comprehensively covers both their energetic improvisation and unique brand of song writing."
5,BAVA AT HIS BEST....,"A beautiful woman's dead lover who enjoyed whipping her with a riding crop comes back to haunt her in a lonely castle by the sea. To reveal more would be to say too much. A stylish, elegant horror film and a must for Bava afficianados, this movie is fairly drenched in vivid color and haunting atmosphere. Of course, the lovely Dahlia Lavi (whatever happened to her?) graces the proceedings with a performance worthy of Barbara Steele and Christopher Lee is her match as the sadistic lover. To compare Lavi to Steele really isn't fair but these are the only two actresses who could have put this role over. Lavi is excellent in delivering the agony and delirium that Steele was so good at. This is most unusual fare for horror fans and not the least bit sensationalistic as it sounds. It's a mood piece in the Grand Guignol tradition that is a worthy addition to anyone's serious collection of ""horror as art""."
3,Non-anamorphic,"This isn't a review of the film so much as it is a review of the product. The VCI disc is an unfortunate by-product of dvd's early life cycle, so it is Non-Anamorphic (this isn't indicated in the product specs). Although it appears to have undergone a restoration, the image quality is dark, fairly murky and some of the finer image details are lost to murkiness, but it is not unwatchable. The English audio is clearer than the Italian one. I haven't seen the other versions of this film released by other companies so I can't make a comparison from one's image quality to the other.I felt the need to post a review of the the disc itself as I didn't see many listed while skimming through the other reviews. The film itself easily fits into the rest of Bava's work. It is not a perfect film, but it certainly has a lot of interesting ideas within it."
5,THE WHIP AND THE BODY,"This film is great like all other christopher lee films they are all terrific with his films especially this one he keeps you guessing what move he will do next i recommend all his films for the old days to the new films ones so watch them and you will agree with me this actor has strived to get well known and it has paid, well done to him in his new film ""lord of the rings"" and his cast etc."
2,Not too hot,"The best part of the whole movie was Christopher Lee with his whip...he was sexy in a menacing, dark way. Too bad they didn't spend a little more time developing the story and concentrate on the sexually sadistic relationship between the two main actors.I liked the opening scene on the beach, after that it was down right silly."
4,"fantastic bava, bad release","One of Mario Bavas best films since the blacks, the onhly problem is the so advertised ""european"" version doesnt even credit bava for the movie.they claim a like John mold for the director. I hate american arrogance, but anyways the transfer is decent, and the sound works, if u can get over the lies at the beggining( any true giallo fan hates to see any american names in the credits)"
2,not good,LOOKED FOR METAL BECAUSE IT USUALLY ADHERES TO SURFACE AND PICKS UP ALL TRASH.THIS DOES NOT. TRASH GOES UNDERNEATH. TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO SEND BACK;THOUGHT HANDLE WAS NEVER GOING TO ATTACH TO DUSTPAN.PACKING AND ASSEMBLY AWKWARD.
3,Fulton 601B long handle dust pan,It takes a fair amount of sweeping to get all the bits & pieces into the pan. I think the lip is too thick.
1,Just doesn't work.,"This is the worst mousse I've used, and I've gone through several brands because my hair is hardly manageable. Suave doesn't stiffen your hair, but that's because it doesn't seem to do anything at all. I get no ringlets, no defined durls, nothing. It seems to dissapear once I put it in. I would not recommend this mousse."
2,The Pack,"Book two of Serenity Falls. Not really going to rehash the story here, but give my opinion of it. Story was alright, not what I expected with the title ""The Pack"" which was a pleasant surprise cuz you're figuring werewolves. The rest of the book though was pretty darn slow. Far too many characters to keep track of and it takes forever for Jonathon Crowley to show up. I am interested in how this will conclude so it's still worth reading to keep up with the story for ""Dark Carnival"". Overall, just not enough suspense and too slow of pace to rate anymore stars."
4,Very good indeed!,"I read the first one in the series (which I gave 5 stars) and this one is very good, but gets a little confusing with the number of characters.Still I would recommend getting this one too. Keeps your interest up."
4,Great Series Continues,I will agree with earlier reviews that there are many characters and this can be a little confusing but I still think this is a wonderful series and I wouldn't have missed reading this book. This series is very reminiscent of early Stephen King. Has a small town with dark undercurrents nice bulding of atmosphere and a cast of characters that you either root for or against. The characters are very dimensional and not just same old seen often personalities. Cannot wait to read next novel in series.
3,"Wasted, in need of an editor","The book takes a long time to kick into gear. We spend a lot of time with a character from book 1, and we know more than he does what he did. Frustrating."
3,meliah rage,"meliah rage was my favorite band in 8th grade...despite MTV airplay of ""beginning of the end"", they never became popular and so i felt like i had something underground to support. this album ""kill to survive"" was a strong debut that should have pushed them up there with the succesful participants in thrash metal, like testament slayer and overkill. i played this tape until i had to buy another one...all the songs were cool at the time with their gory lyrics and catchy riffs...my only question now is...why the hell would someone want to re-release this? it didnt sell then, and it sure as hell wont sell now. meliah rage is a band i hold sacred to my past but probably wont ever listen to again. oh and look...its ranked 150,000 on amazon. by the way...some of the tracks from the bands follow-up album ""solitary solitude"" are here...solitary ranks as one of the top 5 best metal albums of all time...they should have re-released that one...its not as cheesy"
5,The reference book to have for missile simulation,I used this book as a ready refence for all my six degree-of-freedom missile modeling. An excellent presentation. There are 13 chapters with 9 Appendices. I suspect this book is out-of-print - get it while you can!
1,FATIGUE DOES NOT SAY YOU HAVE CFIDS!!!!!!!,"MY NAME IS- THEA SCHLOSSER, FOUNDER OF CHRONIC FATIGUE AND IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION MEDIA AWARENESS SINCE 1993.ALSO WROTE THE BOOK""BEYOND THE DARK CLOUD"". A MOVIE BASED ON MY BOOK, IS BEING PLANED AND THE SCEENPLAY IS COMPLETED. AMAZON.COM HAS A VERY INFORMATIVE DISCRIPTION ON MY STUGGLE WITH CFIDS.WE MUST BRING MORE AWARENESS REGARDING THIS UNKNOWN AMERICAN EPIDEMIC!!!!!!!"
5,Another great book by Dr. Chopra,"If you have ever thought (like me) that medicine cannot solve everything, and that there are many other natural ways to improve your health, than this book is definitely for you. This book gives tips on how to improve almost every aspect of human physiology -- from digestion to fatigue to happiness. Even if you think you are a generally a healthy person, Chopra will make you better. His advice on sleep patterns was especially useful to me, and has made my life much healthier, happier, and more productive. Best of all, this book contains worksheets you can fill out and easily refer back to. Also, it's a pretty short book (about 125 pages) -- Chopra makes his point, and gets out. He doesn't drown you out with complex medical terms. Buy this book. Seriously, it will help you immensely."
3,"Good book, but not related to CFIDS","Just wanted to echo the sentiments of the previous reviewer. I appreciated this book for its advice on managing fatigue, but it has nothing to do with managing chronic fatigue syndrome. The title is confusing - perhaps intentionally so, as there are lots of desperate CFIDS sufferers (myself included) who might be attracted to this book because of the title and the reputation of the author. I sampled it at my local library and decided that it would not be a useful addition to my personal collection of CFIDS literature."
4,Very Informative,This was a very good an informative book. I will use it as a good reference book and keep refering back to it. A good read for anyone with Chronic Fatigue.
2,Overpriced,FYI-I work in nutrition and this fat model is no deal. Most of the fat models that I have come across in catalogs and nutrition resources are new and run between $70-85.
2,Excellent Self Defense Product,"The mail carrier tried unsuccessfully to stuff this 5 pound fat replica into my mailbox, and since I was on a vacation the item was returned to Amazon. I contacted Amazon Support and they suggested the 1 pound model since once again I was planning on going out of town. That saved a lot of shipping cost. I am thinking of order 4 more 1 pounders so I get a total of 5 pounds of replicated fat. I do wonder what part of a replicated person this came out of and I don't want to speculate. Perhaps Amazon could clarify. WARNING: this item is made out of some kind of plastic. Don't try to deep fry chicken in it."
3,Works as advertised,"I bought several of these replicas. They do, in fact, weigh five pounds each and are rather lifelike. However, I presumed they came with some form of adhesive, which would have made my now duct-taped anorexic daughter more presentable."
4,fat replica,Great motivation display for anyone wanting to loose weight. 5 pounds doesn't look like much on the scale but is quite impressive in replica.
5,Extraordinary Read..,"Ms. Hess does a wonderful job in portraying the true life aspects of the life and work in an animal shelter. As was previously expressed, it is a book that everyone should read since it is not only about animals but about the people who take them into their lives as well. We need to take a serious look at our motivations in becoming pet owners. I have passed the book on to my friends to read. It was a wonderful experience and I could not put it down."
5,This book will open your eyes about cruelty & compassion,"This book was written by a journalist who had her eyes opened by the things she experienced as a humane society volunteer.It illustrates the often-cruel consequences of the decisions and attitudes many of us have about pets. It dispels the myth that animal shelters can always provide an unlimited supply of new and better lives for pets that we find are no longer convenient, although the shelters do everything in their power to reach this unattainable goal nonetheless.This book illustrates the consequences behind our love for purebred animals, and exposes the often unscrupulous industry that supplies them. it will make you think carefully about the choices you have made about pets in the past, and it may change the choices you make in the future. It did so for me, and I recommend it highly."
5,You'll want copies for your friends.,"This behind the scenes look at an animal shelter and the everyday lives of the animals, and the people that work there is a beautifully told, heart warming, sometimes devistating story. It certainly drives the point home to adopt your pet rather than buy from a breeder or pet store. It's a book you'll not want to put down, and will remember long after you have. My friends all got copies."
5,Emotional!!!,"This book was great, I loved it. It was difficult to read yet warm and inviting. Some of the events in the book are disturbing but it lets the average person know what really goes on behind those foreign walls at a humane society. I only give praise to all those compassionate souls that work and deal with animals everyday like the people in this book."
4,Good book. Good example of the animal shelter culture,"I thought this was a good read. As a volunteer at a rescue group I could relate to the frustrations that the shelter volunteers faced, and appreciated the attention to the volunteers themselves, the true heroes of this book."
1,Just couldn't get into it,"I love dogs. I've got three of my own, two are rescues. I've been reading alot of ""dog stories"" lately and I just couldn't get into this one. I didn't even finish the book because it just wasn't drawing me in the way that some others have. Based on the other feedback, I seem to be the rare exception. Maybe I've just been reading too many dog books lately. Maybe I'd appreciate it more and enjoy it more if I wasn't thinking about how much better some of the others were."
2,What does work....works well.,"This could be a great machine with just a bit more QC. The rain gauge on my unit does not work well. Most of the time not at all. It is placed well and even when I pour water into it it doesn't record. The main unit sees it, but it just reads ""0"" all the time. No loose wires or anything I can see. Rather cheap and cheesy outside plastic units. Though they are holding up OK. No problems with wireless signal and so far I've had 4 months of battery life and still going strong. The main unit is attractive and finished well, and all works as should. Very clean and readable. All of the touch screen functions good too. Easy to set up and use. If only I could get the rain gauge to work."
2,Acceptable - not great,"Wx station works OK, but did not make me say Wow. My anemometer sensor had to be repaired. Software is weak in functions and lousy in documentation. Display unit was marred, but not enough to be worth the effort to return it. Display backlight does not stay on long enough and is not adjustable - ridiculous.$200.00 should buy a better product."
1,Save your money,I have had three in less then ONE year and this is now on it's way. The LCD screen goes to an unreadable all numbers on. This one has a dead relative pressure display. Stick with Oregon Scientific (I hanve owen one for 10 years & it still works) or a Davis
2,La Crosse 3610,"Owned this product 2 years, and the outside Thermo-Hydro Sensor has stopped working, Have lost all data, and expensive to replace. Difficult to read the inside screen, to much info on to small of a screen, poor contrast..Plus the directions must have been written by and for a PHD...diffinately not user friendly..Spend your money on another Weather Station."
4,La Crosse Weather System,"The weather systems from La Crosse are user-friendly, informative, and well constructed. This was a replacement for a seven year old system for my Dad, and it turned out that the old system had only a loose connection. So even the old system was still going strong after 7 years in the hot sun of Florida. Now my Uncle has the old system and my Dad has his updated one.The only negative was the delayed and slow shipping in that it took 3 weeks for delivery after being ordered."
2,Lost data,"All to frequently, the thermo-hygro unit stops communicating with the base station. A ""factory reset"" is required to restore communication but this results in loss of stored minimum and maximum values. Any rainfall totals are erased as well. Also, the rain gage has failed to record rainfall on occasion. I recently repositioned the thermo-hygro unit two feet along a beam that it was mounted to without disconnecting the battery or cables and it lost communication with the base station. ???I would not recommend this unit."
5,Flexi Elegance Sahara Beige,Flexi Elegance Sahara Beige Retractable Leash. For small to medium-sized dogs up to 55 LBS.Love the product better style for 2008 than the old flexi rectratable. Loved it so much I order a different color. :o)
2,Good but frustrating,"I found this cookbook difficult to interpret. I am not someone who can cook without specific instructions, and this cookbook does not provide them. The pictures are good; the meals are good, but none of that matters if you can't figure out from the instructions how to make it. It seemed like Shelley Young skipped a lot of the recipe instructions and assumed people would understand."
1,Don't waste your money,In a desperate attempt to find more alkaline recipes after reading dr. Young's other books I bought this expensive cookbook by dr. Young's wife. The pictures of the food are terrible and all the pictures of people in this book appear to be family members sitting in the young kitchen and used as filler pages because there aren't very many recipes. If you have the ph miracle book by young you have pretty much the same recipes as in this cookbook. Many of the recipes in this cookbook are also redundant to the point of actually having different names but all the same ingredients and quantities. Very disappointing.
3,Huge Commercial,"It's like reading a huge commercial for what products they promote. It has a lot of good info in it, but I feel you have to dig for it."
3,Not so much,"Very limited unless you live in an area that carries really specialized ingredients, which I don't. I found about two recipes that I actually liked, and they did help with indigestion. The alkaline diet in itself is a good thing, and this book provided some insight and inspiration, but not very many recipes that I wanted to make over and over again, and even fewer that I could even make."
1,"promised so much, delivered nothing","well, i suppose i can't justly declare that, seeing as how i didn't make it past the first, say, 20 minutes.the girl, even as far as B horror is concerned, was terrible.and if you can't pronounce Quixote right, you shouldn't be in films."
1,I honestly puked!,not cause it's gory or anything but for some reaosn this movie made me VOMIT.. the music was obnoxious and nauseating and the movie just kinda made my head hurt..of course I was severely ill before I watched it but ten minutes into it I was praying to old flushable!Might have been good but I couldnt' make it far!
2,When French art film meets horror movie,"Red Riding Hood is an odd, offbeat movie to say the least. A marriage of French art film and horror movie, this is not your typical film. The basic premise is that Jenny, the troubled daughter of a murdered Judge, is abandoned in Rome by her floozy mother. Yet Jenny is happy in her circumstance, because at 12 she has unlimited freedom, until her grandmother, Rose, comes to bring her back to America. Jenny proceeds to launch a campaign of murder and terror on her grandmother, tutor, and all of Rome.While this movie is a marriage of art and horror, it's a rocky marriage at best. At times the movie descends into wackiness, with an original song track of cute songs that at times distracts from the scene. The ending is beyond horror, into an odd, head scratching finale. Jenny is utterly unlikable, which makes the film hard to enjoy.Overall, not the best movie out there."
2,One of those where the box cover is better than the movie!,"I saw the cover to the movie and after reading the synopsis on the back decided to rent. Sounded original and the wolve mask appeared somewhat frightening at first glance. Then I watched the movie. I am a major horror movie fan and have seen some crap in my day. Yes, this was a disappointing movie. But it certainly was not the worst. It at least was done on somewhat decent quality film and not amateur like alot of horror movies. The idea behind the story is very original (tying in a fairy tale and ridding the world of sinners, Sleepaway Camp 2 and 3). Even some of the incidents are somewhat amusing. Sadly enough, the main character is the worst actor. The grandmother wins best actor. What ruins the film is the horrible ending. That scene could have been done creepier with less cheese and saved the movie."
2,Bleh...,The other reviews pretty much cover this movie to death (pun intended) and are pretty accurate. I would like to throw my 2 cents in here... I think the acting was horrible and really detracted from the movie.
3,really weird,"Basically what you have is this kid, Jenny, who is really mentally deranged and does crazy damage to people who she thinks has wronged her. The grandmother gets caught up and trapped in her delusions and is put through utter hell. I literally had to cover my eyes and not watch some of the stuff, it was that GROSS and the most memorable one involved a nail gun shot straight into an eyeball."
4,Great film. Jenny is cute and a killer.,"This film really surprised me. It was original and extremely well acted. Susan Satta plays Jenny, a 12 year old girl abandoned but rich. If you've read the other reviews then you don't need another recap. Let it suffice to say that Susan Satta is fantastic. Watch this film and you'll be rewarded with an original tale (how often have you been able to say that about a movie in the last 20 years?) and a glimpse of what a determined little girl can do. You won't be disappointed. I wish movies of this caliber weren't so rare. By the way, if you do like this movie you might also want to see Chloe Moretz as ""Hit-Girl"" in the film Kick-Ass."
4,"GOD, JUSTICE AND MORALITY","A wealthy abandon 12 year old (Susanna Satta) in Rome spends her time as a vigilante (along with George her alter ego), handing out God's justice to sinners in her own way. Her macabre life is threatened with some normalcy when stage actress grandma (Kathleen Archebald) comes to care for her. The soundtrack changes what would be a bizarre, at times lame, slasher film into an enjoyable dark comedy.Sex, Nudity (Antonella Salvucci)"
3,the typoes make you think,"The authors explain the concepts well. However, there are numerous typoes. Which can lead to confusion, or it can make you think it through.After reading other titles along with this one, you can spot mistakes and work them out. It's kind of like an exercise with the bonus of a good explanation to go with it."
1,Great disappointment,"Heard so much about it while it was NOT published. Would consider it a beginner level discussion on Cisco and IP Addressing. If you have even use MS TCP/IP or know a bit about addressing , this is not for you."
4,"Good value, not perfect","For its price, this is a great machine. True, no video, but if it's as badly produced as the printed instructions, they're actually doing you a favor [grin].Pros: good pressure; easy to use and clean; makes great coffee (with fresh beans properly ground).Cons: steamer arm is short and hard to reach and hard to disassemble to clean (the instructions offer not one word on the topic; the secret is, press the black tabs toward the middle and gently pull down); did I mention the instructions are written in pre-school Martian?I'd buy another, unlike the two Capressos I have donated to the landfill."
1,You can do better,"I received this machine for Christmas, and it's broken - a valve fell out. I called the toll free number for service, and I have to ship it to New Jersey - and I'm in Illinois!! It made great espresso and capuccino while it lasted, but six months isn't long and certainly not worth the purchase price. It will be cheaper for me to buy another, less expensive model."
2,Broke during first use,"I purchased the Briel Apollo, with the expectation of making a great cup of espresso. I live in Miami, and expresso & cafe con leche are necessities. I wanted to get the same quality of coffee at home. When I was making my first capuccino, the steam nozzle worked for about 2 seconds and then the machine emitted a funny smell & now it won't heat up. I am very dissapointed. Seeing that other buyers have had the same problem, I would not reccommend this machine...."
2,watery brew,"We retired our Krups after years of dutiful service and purchased the Briel Apollo for frequent home use. The machine seems well built and reliable, but it failed the real test - making a decent espresso. We found it produced a very watery espresso overall, even after experimenting with different grinds (we don't have a burr grinder, btw). A few other small details were bothersome, like the inability to get anything other than a small teacup underneath to catch the espresso, and a pretty strange system of buttons and indicators to run the brewing process. We ended up buying a Capresso #101 (a bit more expensive and no longer produced, but if you can find one its a good deal) and are very happy."
1,This thing is a piece of junk...,"I should have ""listened"" to the other reviews. Lesson learned.This is a very cheaply made machine. After attempting to make my first latte I decided to pack it up and ship it back. I can't find one good thing to say about this machine.The frother doesn't stay on long enough to steam even 1 cup of milk. When I attempted to make the espresso, it took about 45 seconds to even beginning dripping. After it began it started to make VERY weak espresso - partly due to the fact that I had to remove 1/2 the grounds from the filter so it would lock into place.I'm going back to a ... Krups machine - the only down side is I have to wait for that one to arrive."
1,Don't bother!!,"Don't bother with this machine unless you have at least one hour to make espresso! The pump is not strong enough for ground espresso. Also, you can't drip espresso and steam milk at the same time. My recommendation..DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!"
2,Poor Quality,"The first thing I noticed was the silver sticker on the top of the machine coming off in the corners. The portafilters are some of the cheapest and lightweight I have seen. Machine was not stable on counter and wobbled. Pump seemed very week compared to my last Briel machine. The worst steam feature ever,not dry steam but lots of water spitting out at the same time. Very noisy when steaming milk. Takes a long time to bring milk up to temp."
4,works fine - with a little squirt of WD 40!,"When I first got this it worked great but then - about a day later the gears started freezing up. I read somewhere on here that someone else complained of ""shavings"" from the gears.I think they were strong arming theirs. I gave mine a little shot of WD 40 and let it run down in the gear area and it works GREAT! No problems at all. It does take some muscle to really extract the juice and you can only do one half of a fruit at the time but it will handle anything from small grapefruits to limes.Want a real good drink? (I like Mt. Dew) Take a lime and half it. Squeeze the juice out and add it to your regular Mt. Dew. To me THAT'S how a lime flavored drink should taste! mmmm-good!"
1,hard to handle for old people.,"no directions to maintain or use came ith the juicer.did not seem to extract all the juice,but left pulp all around the edges.I want to return it when I learn how.Your return thing is down.thank You for asking.Lou Borczakborzzak@comcast.net"
2,Mediocre,"It does juice things the way that it should, but after about 10 glasses of OJ the mechanism started to bind up a bit. The spring loaded press and lever wouldn't return to their natural position without assistance, and when you tried to press down to juice the orange there would be some binding. You have to kinda wiggle the press down onto the orange.I'm not really sure how long this thing will really last."
3,Juicer Review,"The juicer is sleek and sturdy. It does take a bit of strength to squeeze the arm down on the fruit. If you don't mind the effort, and you have the time, it gets the job done. The fresh squeezed juice is worth the effort to me. I have had it for several months and use it t least 4 times a week. It looks great on the counter too."
1,"Although compact, this dictionary is of limited value.","Having studied the Estonian language for some time and having spent time studying in Tartu, Estonia, I found that this dictionary is near useless. It is good if you want to have ""something"" in your pocket as you travel around the country, however there are many other dictionaries which are better. This is the only dictionary I found that would fit in a jacket pocket though and that is pretty much its main advantage."
3,"An okay dictionary, but not true Estonian.","The writers are not Estonian. This explains why many of the words in this dictionary are not true Estonian, merely Estonianized versions of English or Russian."
2,What a frustration!,"The Hippocrene dictionary was the first Estonian-English/English-Estonian dictionary that I bought. I was continually frustrated by the absence of words which I wanted to check, in both Estonian and English. The TEA pocket dictionary, published by TEA Kirjastus in Tallinn is much more reliable. Now that I have a copy, I can't even remember where I have abandoned the Hippocrene dictionary.The TEA dictionary is not available yet through Amazon. You'll find it only if you go to TEA's Estonian website and register as a user.OK, Amazon, stock the TEA publications! They are very good!"
5,Rare quality for a live opera video.,"This is really remarkably done. The New York City Opera has produced an live opera video of the most highest in quality. The directing and camera work is excellent as well as sound (which is usually poor in live operas on video).Beverly Sills sounds wonderful. Though mildly aged, she still showcases an ultimate opera singer as well as actress (a rarity when it comes to opera singers). Her emotions and actions are well placed and thoroughly believeable. Vocally, she is a pleasure. No faulties as I far as I could hear. Henry Price, does a superb performance. He is a good actor and extremely confident for the role. Vocally, it fits him very well.The acting is quite good all around -- which is showcased by the excellent camera direction. The scenery and costumes brilliantly recreate the feeling of early 18th-century France. As most operas are sleepy to watch, this was quite compelling and easy to be zoned into. A wonderful archive item."
4,New to Archer Mayor,"I had been looking for a new series. I am a Harry Bosch fan and wanted to find something along those lines. I am growing fond of Joe Gunther and expect to read the entire series. I enjoy the stories very much, though the story can drag a little at times. The details are certainly not lacking. I have enjoyed all of his books to date and encourage anyone to give them a try."
3,Too much of the same,"Mayor has found a niche to keep light sleepers like me awake during the cold winter nights. Not heavy reading, but enough to keep your interest."
3,Disturbing,"I really enjoy the Joe Gunther series by Archer Mayor. However, being a woman, this one was disturbing because of its content on rape. He did a good job trying to give the views from both the person being raped and the boy friend.I will still read more of Archer Mayor's book. I think I just didn't like the subject matter."
2,review Fruits of the Poisonous Tree,This story line was to convoluted and strung out did not come up to the standered of his other books
3,So-So,"These fit the iPod Nano very snuggly. A few problems do exist though. They are very fragile and will tear easily which is unfortunate since you have to partially remove it to plug the nano in for recharging. I've already ripped 2 skins and I expect the 3rd will eventually get ripped too. Also, it's a little hard to see through the skin portion which goes over the nano screen and it attracts lint and small fuzzies which makes it look kind of dirty.A really good thing though is if you can keep from ripping it up and don't mind the lint and don't really need to read the screen, is the fact that the arm band goes through it nicely. I wear mine a lot when I jog/run and since that's what I bought the skins for I really don't have a lot to complain about. They do what I want them to do."
3,Still waiting,I ordered two of the Maxwellp-20 Skin Cases and only recieved one. Still waiting for the second one.
3,Incredible - if it's what you need.,"Amazing product, incredible capabilities. Everything looked good until I found it doesn't work with Ooma, the VOIP phone system."
1,Kinky is Stinky,"The Mile High Club has a minimal plot and a maximum of annoying Kinky aphorisms. One soon gets tired of both. Our Book Club was unanimous in declaring ""Thumbs Down"" on this read."
1,mile high was low,"i found Kinky's work was boring. i waited for something to really happen. Blower was dumb,take a nixon was not funny and a few other goofy sayings trying to be funny but not getting it done. no wonder you wont get more than 3.50 for this book.AS"
3,The dialogue is pure Kinky but the story lags behind others,"I got hooked on the series a few years ago with ""A Case of Lone Star."" I have read every one since and love them - Kinky, please keep writing. The wise cracks, the plot, and Kinky's Krazy Kast of Kharacters made that one a hoot - I loved every word. This edition still has the highly irreverent dialogue and nutsy group of irregulars but, still, there was something missing. The basic idea of the passports as McGuffen seemed way too unbelievable to catch and hold me. At any point, a more reasonable man would have collected them and dropped them on the desk of your local FBI agent. By being too clever in this one (and Kinky is very clever) he lost me and that's too bad. Still, I'll buy the next and next and next and read every one in the hope that Mr. Friedman hasn't run out of good ideas."
4,the kinkstah delivers,"Kinky Freedman always gives you a fast paced enjoyable read.I prefered some of his earlier works 'Musical Chairs' and 'Frequent Flier' to this one. None the less, fans of Kinky will feel right at home with the usual cast of irregulars in this mystery. Another book I recommend is 'MURDER DOESN'T FIGURE' by first time author Fred Yorg. He has many of the same endearing qualities that Kinky's book have plus a cat named Tuxedo."
2,Kinkstah Stinkstah,"I like Kinky, I really do. But I've had it up to here with his shtick. There's no meat on this bone. It has a thin plot along with the same old tired jokes and scenarios - the cat, the lesbians upstairs, the same crusty one-liners.Although Kinky finds himself in the middle of a bunch of incompetent terrorists, he still manages to find the time to take several afternoon naps. I think the Kinkster took a long siesta over his Smith-Corona at the time he wrote this masterpiece.Don't throw your money into the dumper. 23 bucks will get you a good cigar and maybe a black wooden puppet head."
3,ENTERTAINING,My book club choose this book. It was my first time reading a Kinky Friedman novel. I was not disappointed. I think I'll read another one.
4,Kinky At His Finest,"I read Kinky Friedman mysteries not for plot but for the fresh, raunchy, philosophical whirlpools along the way. While Mile High Club doesn't have much plot, it's Kinky at his funniest and finest. Get it, read it, smoke a cigar, enjoy."
4,5 stars if it were longer!,"This is one of my favorite reads by the Kinkster and, as with so many others, it was just too short. And, I figured out the quirk of his nemesis (one of the author's favorite ruses) immediately. However, Mile High Club was especially eerie since I read it soon after the World Trade Center disaster of 9/11/01. Too bad Kinkster...more people should have read Mile High Club in time to save the twin towers."
4,It's not my fault,"There is a continual undercurrent of experience. Cutting through to the chase is not nearly as entertaining as the dialogue. And that's the beauty of this book. Things happen, we deal with them. In Kinky's case in his own unique way. As I read I ask myself. Am I as smart as Kinky? What would I do? Some of the same or something different? Many ways this narrative connects to me. Does it connect to you?"
4,Lovely flute music,"I love McCartney's piece ""A Leaf"". Originally written for piano, it was given a beautiful orchestral arrangement for the album, ""Working Classical"". Here, it is performed by a flute quartet. A fine album."
1,Very Disappointed,"The specs on the bag stated that there were mesh panels for drainage and ventilation. Well if there any, I sure couldn't find them. Not a good quality in a bag used to place wet equipment. The bag also has an awful smell that will hopefully dissipate over time. I'm very sorry that I purchased this bag."
3,Not As Advertised,I just received my U.S. Divers Snorkeling bag. This bag is indeed sturdy with enough room for 2 sets of snorkeling gear and has a handy shoulder strap. However there are no large grommets in the bottom of the bag to drain the water that may accumulate. That was one of the main reasons I bought the bag so I may now have to add my own grommets to make it work as it should. How about the seller making the corrections to the description!
1,Total crush of documentary genre.,"I think that this movie is totaly boring, like I said total crush of documentary movies. I slept half of the movie and my wife said that this half was even worse than first. Don't buy this movie."
4,Blind Pig Records,Almost anything from Blind Pig Records is going to be great and this is no exception. The match-up with Pinetop on piano is nice - two older men who can still really play!!
2,product review,Sound quality is VERY POOR-as if you're in a tunnel. Only selection I liked wasA NEW DAY because the words were so inspiring!
3,Don't Blink!,Certainly NOT for beginners! More for intermediates who happen to learn fast. The good points are that if you are a quick study then you dont have to worry about repetition. You can get right to the meat of the steps. The music is cute and modern. A bad point is that they only really demonstrate the lead's part. The young man puts on so many flurishes to his dance that it would be very confusing to many people as to what is the step to be learned and what is just fancy extra stuff. The young lady is a very good dancer and fun to watch. I would suggest this video only if you want to practice between live classes but not if you want to try and learn it alone.
2,Got my Mojo Workin',"This kind of song has a deep feeling of blues and also has the corus behind, what give to the song some feeling of gospel song. The style and the spirit of pinetop is in the song. Maybe my english is not perfect but I do me best effort."
3,EXCELLENT BUT WENT RELIGIOUS,"The author betrays the Christian environment of her time. The first 2/3 of the book is brilliant and well worth the money. The last part included quoting the same verse of the Bible repeatedly and insisting Jesus was greatest of all spiritual masters. That annoyed me....but, in her time anything but baptism was considered occult so she crammed Jesus in at the end to exonerate herself, her teachings and her teacher."
1,YOUR INVISIBLE POWER,"This book is very hard to read and follow, her sentences are paragraphs long. They ramble on and on with big uncommon words. She must have been on something, and only written it for her own understanding and benefit, I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,The Pokemon are Back for their Final Theatrical Voyage,"This part 6/10. ""Pokemon Heroes"" really stuck with me after I watched it. It also has a great rewatchable factor. I do think the obvious reference to Annie Oakley was corny though. Who would ever name their daughter Oakley? Latias and Latios are interesting. I like having two main characters with this one. The connection between the two made this a great watch. The likelihood to Venice was great. I loved watching the race through Alto Mare at the beginning. Definitely a good comeback for Pokemon."
1,A re-issue of the older edition,"I pre-ordered this hoping it would be somewhat of a better transfer. But nope, I'm terribly disappointed. The disc is only 2.73GB when put in a computer (where the old one was dual-layer), has NO captions or subtitles whatsoever, and not even surround sound, ONLY English stereo. It's the same blue-tinted 4:3 fullscreen transfer as the earlier Miramax DVD, but this disc has no special features like that one did.It's as if they took the original release, stripped it of all its extras and subtitles, and shoved it on a new disc. Avoid this one, hopefully the Blu-Ray will be proper. If you want to own PokÃ©mon Heroes on DVD, go for the older, Miramax, DVD - it may not be widescreen but at least it has more to offer than this one!!"
5,Amazing,"So what if I love to watch pokemon.Thats me an anime fan.Im over 13.There was alot of action with a good story.The only part that dissapointed me was when Latios died at the end of the movie .Trying to protect the island of altimore.Team rocket were barely in the movie , but the were funny ,and retarded as always.Its 71 mintues culd of been longer.But its very enjoying if your a pokemon fan buy this dvd."
4,stupid and smart pepole (preety good),"stupid-annie, OAKLEY, misty.smart-ash, brock, team rocket, latios, latias.good movie and filled with humourannie and oakley try take over the world, get trapped in a sphere, but when opens they don't get out.Misty just doesn't use her head. e.x. (after ash is hurt and puzzled) ""Hi want some ice cream!?"" (not excat words though)"
2,Not the same...,"When Pokemon first debuted, I thought it would rock, and Misty, Brock, and Ash would stay together as a gang forever, and Ash would love it to just be walking around the world, earning badges, etc., and that's the way it would stay. Maybe even Ash and MIsty would fall in love! But, nope. The dudes who are creating these movies are sucking kids in with exclusive Pokemon cards, and the animation is just getting cheaper. This movie is totally different from the original movies and the TV series, and it sucks. I'll hold on to the older series and DVD's, but, nowadays, Brock and Misty are gone, and it's just boring without them. For those who agree with me, get the message out there that Pokemon is going down the tubes and it stinks. Bring back Brock and Misty!!! IT WILL SAVE THE SERIES! Oh, and I'm only giving this movie two stars because they went so far as to make a movie about something so ridiculous, with so much change, and so little things the same. :-( Boo."
5,Best yet!,"If you havn't seen Pokemon Heroes,go watch it. It starts when a boy called Ross takes Ash,Misty and Brock on a tour of Ultimar Town,a city made to look like Venice. Misty notices some statues of Pokemon that look like the Pokemon on the Glass Medallion she won in a water race with her Corsola.Ross tells them they are Latias and Latios,a brother and sister pair that guard the city. After the tour Pikachu runs off and Ash follows. (...).The story is beautifly told and the 3d graphics would be great in an Imax theater. It is sad,funny and a little romantic. This is the only Pokemon movie with romance. The only problem with it is that it isn't clear why Oakley wants to destroy the city until the movie is two thirds over. That's the only thing wrong. Pokemon fan or not,you should definately watch this. It's worth it 100%."
2,False Product Info,"It says in the product info that this DVD is in widescreen format, but I was upset to find out that it was full screen. If you want a better package and if you're a true PokÃ©mon fan get the original DVD release from 2003 that has the Pikachu Short and some other Special Features, NOT this poorly re-released version that isn't even in widescreen."
1,boo,not very good not worth getting it is not good pokefan is wrong and im right not the same as original boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo
5,Kids that love Pokemon will have a blast!,All the action packed excitement you experienced in the movie theater comes home in this dazzling full length motion picture that introduces Latios and Latias.

Packed with nonstopbthrills awe inspiring animation and extraordinary characters. Pokemon heroes is a movie adventure you're sure to cheer!
5,Best Pokemon Movie,"I've seen most of the Pokemon movies with my son, and I definitely think this is the best one by far. It may not be the best movie in the world, but it's worth watching. All of the other Pokemon movies seem to have the same exact plot, just with different characters thrown in. This movie has a wider range of characters and motives, and is visually quite nice. I could actually relate to the ""joyful"" scenes in this movie as well."
2,Strange and not structured,"I do a lot of yoga, so I thought I would really like Shiva Rea's ab workout; I didn't. It doesn't have much structure at all and at the end of the ab segments she just tells you to basically do whatever you want. The production quality is beautiful and the music is great - I just wish it was slightly more traditional."
4,Something different for the stomach,"This is my first Shiva Rea workout that I have done.This is definitely one of the more unique core exercise DVDs out there. Not too many have instructors that tell you to improvise during the course of the ab workout.Deceptively easy, if you perform the flow correctly, you will feel it the next day. Takes a little getting used to the flow, for me a few times through. On the new-agey side of yoga in feel and flavor, if that bothers you skip this one. A lot of leaning back while on your knees (example, the front cover of the DVD). There's a little bit of dance/rhythm to this, but really it's about a flowy rhythm.The 35 minutes can be broken up into three segments, and the segments are distinct and of different styling.I purchased this to add to my existing regimen of running and gym weightlifiting, and this seems to serve that purpose. Currently in my workout DVD rotation."
4,Exceptional outdoor location and narrative,Very well made video shot at sundown with brilliant scenery. Instructor shows how these yoga-type exercises can enhance your ab workout. Nice change of pace to what I've seen available. Lovely music with drummings. Perfect for an end-of-the-day routice.
4,Unique Core Workout,"The first thing you notice about this DVD is the breathtaking scenery--it's filmed in White Sands National Park, New Mexico.The roughly 35-minute workout is divided into three segments: Water Core, Spontaneous Core, and Fire Core. Shiva provides easygoing instruction. Using both Sanskrit and English terminology, she shows modifications of the more difficult moves. On days when you just don't feel like working out, try this DVD--Shiva's fusion of yoga and toning might just change your attitude."
4,Good video,"This was a good ab workout. It is however a lot like pilates. I was hoping for more standing work.I like Shiva Rea as an instructor, so I enjoyed working out with this one also."
1,Irritating Exercise,"This DVD gives several options for viewing, unfortunately turning the music off isn't one of them. I never did make it through and entire workout because of this."
5,Excellant workout,This is a great yoga work out for abs. This is a must have for teachers and those who enjoy yoga at home.
3,Kind of goofy,"Creative Core Abs really does mean what the title says - the routine is kind of goofy, in my opinion. I'm really not that excited by New Age stuff, and this DVD is pretty new age what with the drummer in the background and the fairly non-structured routines. I could also do without all the earth, wind and fire gibberish.However, the actual workout will help to tone you up assuming you can keep up with the instructor. This is not a ""structured"" type routine! If you are the type who likes doing 50 pushups, 50 situps and so on you will probably not like this DVD - the instructor goes into all kinds of free flow motions throughout."
2,I did not like this ab workout,"I bought this DVD with high hopes, but I did not like it. It is very much about ""move on your own"" ""feel the music and work your abs"" The background music is trance drumming."
4,"Fluid, freestyle ab workout","For those who desire a break from the mundane abs crunch workout, this video features a freestyle way of engaging your core muscles. Once you perform this, it seems natural that there are many very fluid movements for tightening up the abs, and in the process improving flexibility. I also find it to be somewhat meditative, and definately de-stressing. It is very creative. Although I still do my crunches and standard stomach exercises, using this DVD with the wonderful music in the background once or twice a week is a nice addition to my routine."
1,Over-rated,"After reading most of the positive reviews, I chose to purchase this program and was eager for the arrival-much to my disappointment. Personally, I like a program with a structured lesson plan that can guide me through everyday practice. In my experience,Rodney Yee's beginner abs program has proven to be more effective in working the core and builds enough definition to clearly distinguish upper, middle, and lower abs."
3,Very Creative,"I had a hard time follwing the moves. I am a huge fan of work- out videos, but this one was just a bit too creative for my liking."
3,Kind of a weird workout,"I guess this is a good abs workout, but a little new-agey weird. I thought it would be more like yoga. Unfortunately, this DVD has now migrated to the bottom of my stack of workout DVDs... Oh, well."
2,Only buy this if you like yoga,"This DVD does give you a good ab workout, but there are a lot of yoga moves that are difficult for a beginner. I would not recommend this for anyone who doesn't enjoy yoga."
2,Very different way to look at abs. I felt very foolish.,"I am not very comfortable with this dancey, wiggly, free form way to work your abs. I feel like I look like a big out of shape slob doing this tape, while Shiva is near anorexic it looks good on her- but I feel and look like a fool dong this type of workout. Not impressed- but i had sore abs afterwards, I am embarrased to ever do it again."
5,Very Creative,"I like the idea of using your whole body to work your core abs. This is a intersting way to keep your whittle your middle...okay, not very yogic, but you get the picture. So far, I've only completed the segments 1 at a time which has been plenty for me.I've found that whenever I describe Shiva Rea's DVD's the word thoughtful comes to mind and that's how I feel about this. Time, effort, and care has been infused in and throughout this DVD."
1,no instructions at all,"This was like watching someone do a belly dance on her back, but there is no instruction! Maybe I'm supposed to use the visuals as inspiration to writhe around on my own, since this DVD advices you to create your own 'dance'. I was disappointed, but maybe it works for others who like this free form style."
3,Core Abs,"It's okay, but I was a bit dissappointed. I had never heard of Shiva Rea before, but thought I'd give it a shot. She is very hippie and free-spirited which is cool, but I was looking for someone more intense. I do like that there are three different lengthed workouts, though."
1,Great scenery but awful instructions if any - not for beginners,"There was very minimal if no instructions and the camera angles were such that you couldn't clearly see how to do most of the moves. I have enough experience in Yoga but still found this very difficult. I got dizzy trying to follow her. The exercises could be great, except, she needs to re-create this DVD with better instructions and camera angles (Shiva! Are you out there? Please pay attention). This was more like a music video hightlighting Shiva's & the scenery's beauty. I can't wait to see a newly improved version of this - better teaching? Perhaps Jillian Michaels should help out."
4,Good read,"Taylor is a very believable character, the isolation of youth followed by some awareness as she got older were well portrayed. I wished that the ending were left a little more ambiguous."
5,Taylor Made Quality,"Day has skillfully crafted a moderday yarn with a gentle soul. ""The Way to Somewhere""'s muted beatuy unfolds by gleening relevance from the Gen X experience; a real world where greater options and wider access blur rather than clarify our dreams. As you move with Taylor through the smoke and mirrors of her young adulthood, you are reminded that hope and persistence can debunk the myths of role and gender. Day serves up bitesize knowledge that's tastier than fresh ice cream ... powerfully condensed wisdom for the Ritalin set."
5,I wish Taylor were my neighbor!,"For anyone who tends to get obsessed with the destination and forget the (much more fun, and much more important) journey: clear your Palm, grab a beer, flop on the sofa, and kick back with ""The Way to Somewhere."" You'll start rooting for Taylor as soon as she steals that ice cream truck, and you'll wish you could give her advice as she deals with her family, dates a few wrong men and finally figures out what's what. Then again, you never do really figure out what's what. See? You get some good philosophy too. Read it."
3,A Clunky Translation,"Unfortunately, the first Russian-edition Harry Potter leaves a lot to be desired. The translation is awkward and stilted, and best skipped entirely in favor of the later Russian editions, which keep more to the spirit of the orginals."
5,Russian translation of first Harry Potter,"The book arrived quickly and in good shape. A review on Amazon found the translation to be poor, so I am looking fofward to reading it to see where the translator fell down."
2,Misleading size,"Purchase a large size and it fits more like a children's size large. It is a fitted shirt, but is way off on what a std shirt size Large would be for a regular women's size."
3,It's Just Tape!!,"The tape didn't really do much for me other than offer the same support as other tapes. Actually it became an irritant if left on for more than 24 hours. The anecdotal stories of "" the miraculous pain relieving qualities of titaniun tape"" never materialized for me. Do yourself a favor - go see a doctor or therapist - skip the titanium tape."
1,The real experiment in torture is sitting through this movie,"Have you ever seen one of those short films that college students make in their spare time? Now imagine one of those padded out to feature length and you have this film.The acting is horrible, everything takes place off camera since there was obviously no budget for any kind of special effects. The few times a makeup effect appears onscreen, the camera shakes all over the place like there was an earthquake during filming, while the image goes in and out of focus. This is done to hide the fact that the ""makeup"" is just a couple pieces of rubber glued onto the person's skin. It literally looks like they took a hunk of rubber, painted it pink and stuck it on the actors.You can find better amateur films on YouTube.Bad acting, bad effects, bad camera work, and a bad story add up to a bad movie! Don't waste your money."
2,Unbelievably dull,"What in the world happened to Lemon Jelly? Their last album <em>Lost Horizons</em> was easily one of my favorite, and most-listened-to albums of the past couple of years, but something dreadful happened in between. <em>Horizons</em> was full of intrigue, wit, melody, and was an utter joy to listen to over and over. <em>64-95</em> feels like luke-warm Chemical Brothers, with flat beats and mind-numbingly repetitive arrangements. It's a huge step backward."
2,if you advertise a product you should by the very least describe what you're selling.,"i would'nt buy a car without seeing it, why would you advertise an item with absolutely no description."
4,Awesome but I still have one complaint,"This is a great cookbook and organized extremley well with awesome recipes. I was just disappointed because there are absolutely NO pictures of any of the recipes. For me, it is important to have pictures of completed dishes at least so I can visually prepare myself for making the dish.If pictures aren't important to you, then this is the *best* Asian noodle book around (I have looked thru many others and this one covers it all!)"
4,Great video! Might couple it with a workshop,I thought this was a great video for beginners and experienced dancers alike. Beginners might want to watch this video several times or perhaps pickup a copy of Big City Swing - Beginning Lindy Hop to go with this video for maximum effects.Of course if you have the option - take a workshop in your area covering Lindy Hop and then review this video to add some style to your Lindy.
4,"Amazing Dancers, Amazing Teachers",Marcus and Barble are two of the best swing dancers in the world.Watch their tapes and see why!!
5,A very well thought out compilation,"I have had this playing in the background at dinner parties, I've listened to it alone, in the car. It caters to any ear, and the tracks have been so carefully selected, you can't help but think that this was a labour of love for whoever put it together.As someone who is Indian but doesn't listen to Indian music that much, I found this a compilation full of nostalgia and it remains mainstream without ever getting cheesy. Not an easy trick to pull off.For anyone for whom Hindi is not their mother tongue, the innocence of Bollywood music through 3 decades combined with instruments that are not often heard in western music will draw you in. Of that I am sure. There isn't a duff tune in this compilation. Buy it - you will not be dissapointed!"
2,pauvre pauvre aix en provence,Aix en Provence est maintenant abonnÃ© a des mises en scenes soit disant modernes mais affligeantes et ici non soutenue par des chanteurs de seconde zone en particulier un contre tenor sorti d ou on ne sait ou et qui ferait mieux d y retourner
5,Totally Agree With Mayhem's Review,This series should get a US airing. We Americans love the British countryside and I think would appreciate the thoughts behind this series much more than some of our British counterparts.
5,Very nice product,"This product is a quality product. It did not disappoint me when it arrived. The product is well made and displays well. It also has an adjustable sizer for large to small adults, and probably would fit children as well. I dressed for Halloween and wore it over a wig and it fit well. Feathers come with the hat which is a nice add-on. The hat is impressive and looks nice when wearing it."
3,NOT a Toy!,"This hat is NOT a toy, in my opinion. It is a costume. You can't play with it, as you would a toy. I am an adult and I ordered it to wear on Halloween night when I answer the door, for ""Trick or Treaters"". I thought it would be fun for the neighborhood children!"
3,Not at all what I wanted,This hat is made very well but if you are looking for a hat that loos authentic this is not the hat for you. It has a green & black checkered line that is very visible and not in the movie. I was not happy.
1,More tripe from the most vapid of literary critics,"Anyone who is bewildered that a Harvard professor could write such a pretentious, useless tome should take a look at Peter Singer's review of The Body in Pain in the New York Review of Books."
2,Diappointing,"This is certainly an impassioned defence of beauty, and a 'feel-good' book, but it is so lacking in substance is barely counts as a contribution to the debate. It's incoherent at many levels, most notably concerning the switch from the accepted idea in part one that beauty is always particular, to the claims in part two that it is a function of certain qualities, especially symmetry. Asthetic symmetry promotes ethical justice? The idea of beauty as enlivening is also too simple. This is not good enough as a theory of the link between aesthetics and ethics. The account of the so called 'political complaints' against beauty is a set of caricatures. There is also a very weak accounts of Matisse, whose Nice paintings are regarded by Scarry as stand ins for real windows and real palm trees; some sense of what modernist art has done to the concept of beauty and why is needed here. There are many better books on the topic."
3,Cesar Romero as a diplomatic courier,"In this black & white TV series from 1954, Cesar Romero plays a diplomatic courier who makes a dangerous visit to a foreign city in each episode. Titles in this volume are ""Monte Carlo,"" ""Tangiers,"" ""Tehran,"" and ""Turkey."""
3,Who proofread this?,"Although I am learning a lot from this book, it is a struggle. The step by step instructions are not always clear and sometimes omit important information. Other times the text is just sloppy. For instance, the authors say to name a file, say, file1. Through the rest of the example they refer to the file as file_1. Saying a button is the second from the right on a vertical toolbar is another. It's a good thing you can download the project files from the publisher's website to see what they really are talking about. If I didn't already have experience with Dreamweaver 4 and Fireworks 4, I'd probably be really lost."
1,What Stewart said,"Stewart (below) had already written my review for me before I logged in to do it...he's right on the money. I'm not new to web development or Cold Fusion and am so fascinated by Dreamweaver MX 2004 (absolutely buy the beyond excellent ""Missing Manual"" book for it, BTW) that I bought Studio MX 2004 and I hoped this book would get me up and running. After 115 pages of cryptic how-to's that assume you already know how-to, and a lot of discussion about how to deal with your client and draw a flowchart (the diamond shape is a decision box, it sez here...really!), I threw up my hands and realized I had made a bad buy. If you already know the individual products in Studio well, this may be of great help to you. If you're coming from Cold Fusion Studio and have limited exposure to graphic design, run far, far away from this one."
2,"Ok, at best","This game is ok, but alas, if you must have IGT in your collection, get the newer version that has a better interface and graphics. I still think Masque needs a CD with Wheel of Fortune, Elvis, Jeapardy, and a few IGT video slots like Little Green Men, Texas Tea, and I Dream of Jeannie."
4,Just Like the Real Thing,"My husband gave this to me for Christmas. He knows I like to play the slots and he knows I don't win very often. He probably thought I'd have better luck with these. But, they are just like the real thing. There is a ""high payoff"" mode that I haven't tried because that seems like cheating.I enjoy these because I know I'm not losing any money."
4,An update,"Hey people, just heard from Masque, and they told me our wishes are going to come true. They will be upgrading this to the Bally Slot standards, and including the multi-play Poker with it.Can't wait. If so, give it at least 5 stars. Their other 2 slot games are among the best.Downside? The denominations are limited to $5. I'd like to see them fix this."
4,Works perfectly on the DCS 3600,This product installed without any issues on my DCS 36 SS inch grill. All ignitors sparked with no issues. Only thing that I wish they included is the springs for making contact to the other metal on the gas tube.
4,Perfect repalcement part,"I have an 11 year old 27"" outdoor DCS grill that needed work. The electronic ignition wasn't working on either side. This part is not DCS original but works perfectly and was easy to install. It was also very affordable. Both burners ignite they way they are supposed to. It was a good purchase."
5,Good overview of renewable technologies with UK focus,"This is the textbook for the Open University course on renewable energies. Well written, well illustrated, lots of detailed examples, data and references."
4,Great bag but deceptive,Love everything about this bag but airports don't! Although it is within the TSA/airline size parameters for carry-on bags - the airline will have you check it! So get the next size down if you're looking for a carry on that will take anything the environment & airports can dish out!
5,Blackhawk MOB Bag,I really like this bag. It has plenty of room for short trips and is easy to carry with the double straps included. Well constructed with heavy duty zippers. I expect it would hold up well over time. It's a bit pricey but you really get what you pay for nowadays. Would recommend to others.
4,collection of Christmas stories,"We have a collection of Christmas books, and we try to read stories all through advent. This book is one we have accessed for years. Bob's favorite is the last story which is a rather lengthy adaptation of Martin the Cobbler. The Christmas stories are intended for older children and adults. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because we have other books that have more favorites."
1,Destructive Emotions,"This is not what I expected. I would not recommend. Slow pace, boring voice and long."
3,Dog house,"Smaller than I thought, even though it came broken still sturdy. Would buy again if I had another dog, big enough for a female lab"
2,Caution,I had to order this product three different times because they kept being delivered broken. When I did receive a intact one it's lasted a long
4,Good looking dog house,"I have a medium size Shiba Inu (20lb), this house fits him perfectly. He is a little shy, now he has a nice place to hide."
3,"So far, so good.","It was easy to put together even for someone with arthritic hands and 0 mechanical intelligence, so that's a big plus. There must be a better product.This may not hold up as advertised as it already (after 2 months or so) has scratches on the side, but perhaps raccoons got it?My feral cats won't go in it despite horrific storms and a nice cushion they like as a perch on lawn chairs (covered in a cat pad that is irresistable to the tamed feral cat) placed inside it. The reviews all said the feral cats loved it. I thought this would be irresistable, sturdier and warmer than it appears to be."
3,This is a Medium dog house,"I thought that because the profile says ""good for large dogs"" it would be for a 50lb dog, but it's not. I have a chow mix, which isn't very big, he's about 48lbs and only comes up to my knees, but he can't fit through the door into this dog house. I thought I bought a large, but this company only sells Medium houses online. The product itself is fine if you have a medium dog <40lbs."
1,not for outside use,"I wanted a weather proof house since I had no outside porches where a bed could be made for an outside cat. Unfortunately, the door on this house slopes toward the top of the house from the bottom which lets rain come in freely. When the plastic door is added, it acts just like a funnel for water since it hangs down into the house. I have even positioned it away from prevailing winds. All bedding got wet, and it is unusable during wet weather and a mess to clean out. It's too large to try and ship back, so I will probably donate it to the local Humane Society."
2,Sub compact,I contacted the company and asked what size I should get for my 58 lb. Irish Setter. They recommended medium. Good thing I didn't take their advice because she can barely squeeze into the large! She refuses to use it at all.
1,defective upon arrival,"They do not make these dog igloos like they did 12 years ago when I purchased my first one. Quality is lacking. It arrived with a broken latch that connects the base to the top portion of the igloo (yes, the latches are made of cheap plastic). Also, they do not seem as thick as the older models do-- perhaps not as much insulation in them? I had to return the item because of the defect. My recommendation is to go to a home improvement store where you can purchase pressure treated wood (and where they will cut it into pieces for you)- just some 4X4's for the corners, plywood for the floor and walls and roof, and some screws. Be sure to paint or stain the pressure treated wood before your pet uses it in order to minimize th epet's exposure to the chemicals in the pressure treated wood."
3,Poor shipping,"Well first off we got this one week late, but I believe that was UPS's fault. The house is shipped wrapped in a plastic bag. No protection at all. Ours arrived with a 3 inch crack right above the entrance. The crack goes all the way through. I would send it back but I think I'll just put some tape over it to protect it. I don't think I could find a bag big enough to put it in to ship back anyway. Our dog doesn't mind the crack at all. The house seems to be well made and will protect our dog from the elements. Just wish they packaged it for shipping better."
4,Dog House,"The last one lasted about 5 years before it started cracking and falling apart. The new one seems to be constructed similarly. The old one was white which I prefer, but that is not a choice now."
2,too small,"ad stated medium...pet weighs barely 40 lbs...entry too small,will not enter. breed is german short hair. feel misled by size of doghouse"
4,Medium Dogloo is a great Catloo!,"They're very nice. To extend the Indigo Catloo and protect the cat from the rain, wind and snow, put the outdoor rubber/carpet rug on top of the entrance, with ends hanging down to the floor, or the ground (rubber side - up, carpet - down). It's not too beautiful, but very functional. Actually it's even better then the door. (Doors for Dogloo are not really doors, I found them practically useless and returned to the company). It works well with my cat condo home too. One of my 6 cats doesn't use Indigo. He sleeps in the carton box, plased inside of a medium rubbermaid box (plastic box is seating sideways on the porch) with my winter coat in it! It looks flimsy; the Cat loves it and completely ignoors his new condo!"
2,Too small,"The item looked very nice, but it was to small for my Malamute, so I sent it back, without major problems."
5,Sir Chopper's New House,"I finally found a house that Sir Chopper will go into...he hated his former dog house: the standard gabled roof. He entered the Indigo immediatelly, something he'd never done with the old house."
4,Igloo dog house,"Okay...the dog looked at it a bit strangely before actually going inside the thing, but it works just fine. Glad I got it and fairly decent price."
5,Dog Haven,"This doghouse has been wonderful for my pup. It is waterproof and the vent works well to keep air flowing through, which is important.I would recommend filling it with hay, and not wasting time on the pad, especially if your dog has a tendency to chew when bored. The hay has an added bonus of extra insulation during the winter and is soft and scratchy for the dogs at the same time. It also helps to keep the door from blowing in the wind.My dog likes to nap in the house out of the sun while I am doing yardwork, or hide from the rain and snow. Great purchase and it came set up right out of the box."
3,"Interesting, but doesn't live up to the hype","This vaguely reminded me of the first 100 Bullets volume in that it was a bunch of unconnected stories about people being gifted with something they could use to take revenge/defend themselves/etc. In both cases, if it wasn't for the good reviews, I wouldn't be interested in picking up future volumes. Kirkham's artwork wasn't nearly as polished as it was on the recent Strykeforce mini. It reminded me an awful lot of the rookie pencillers doing work in the early Image days like Anthony Winn and Marat Mychaels. Gregory's narration seemed a bit heavy handed at times, but his dialogue was pretty good. So, in summation, I have no idea where this book is going, but am almost intrigued enough to pick up the next trade."
1,None,yikes...... started out informative and rapidly devolved into self absorption and boy friends great waste of money and time ....what a privilaged bore
4,A quick inspirational read,"I saw this book at my local library and picked it up to take on vacation with me. From the first page, this book portrays Trisha's heartbreaking yet amazing journey to recovery. She tells the story well, but I found that the book bounced back and forth a lot. Nevertheless, she has come a long way since her attack and continues to inspire people today. I would recommend it to anyone going through recovery or their close friends and family."
5,Tells of her life before and after the encounter,"In 1989 a young woman went for a job in New York's Central Park - and was brutally beaten and left for dead. Her survival under nearly impossible odds and her recovery over the years is charted in I Am The Central Park Jogger, her strong memoir, which tells of her life before and after the encounter, and the long healing process she had to undertake."
5,Talk about courage...,This is a fantastically written book - not an ounce of self pity! This book is about a strong woman reclaiming her life. I am inspired by her courage. The writing style is easy to read and not bogged down by too many details or medical lingo. I am riveted by her story (as I was when it happened in 1989 - I am from NYC!) and I am thankful that Trisha has lived to tell the tale!
3,Fan,Cd was ok but only wanted it for the hard to find track called ANGRY. Other than that product was sent out and received swiftly.
5,Wedding gift to my Bride,I bought these ear rings for my Bride to wear at our Wedding on July 9th.They are beautiful !!
1,Not for the tall,"This bike is very, very small. If you're over 6' buy something else. I'm going to have to send it back or sell it as every time I pedal my knees hit the handlebars. At 6'3 this problem shouldn't be so dramatic. the bike is also flimsy generally, from the contruction of the body to the poles that support the seat and the handlebars, the bike feels like its about to come apart at any moment."
2,Lasted for 2 years.,"I purchased this bike 2 years ago and was very happy with it. I was loosing weight, getting stronger and cholesterol was going down nicely. Then after 2 years with it, I started hearing squeaking sounds and the bike started to lean on both sides. I took the covers off and saw that the weld that bonds the post holding the control panel was cracked at the base which explains the squeaking and the leaning. I am so disappointed. Now I have to find another machine to continue with my progress but it won't be this machine that's for sure. I give it 2 stars for the 2 years it lasted."
1,Bike arrived and console is non functional,I am frustrated because I have not had good luck with online purchased exercise equipment service in the past. I decided to try Amazon and a name (Schwinn) that seemed reputable. The packaging was a bit torn up but the bike seemed to be going together fine until it was time to plug in and go. The console is not functioning. All connections are right and yet...nothing. Now I have to wait until Monday for customer service.
4,Schwinn 131 upright bike,"The bike arrived in great shape and within 60 minutes I had it together and was riding it. Consumers Reports rated this bike as one of the top buys, and I can see why. The bike is reasonably priced, comfortable and had a really nice feel when working out. The assortment of programs on the computer screen will keep you from getting bored.The bike also is very easy to adjust to fit different riders, and extremely quiet. I would definitely recommend this bike to friends and family."
4,Schwinn 131 bike is great,"All the previous reviews helped me make my decision to purchase this bike. I am pleased that I did. My daughter and I both like all features, and the quality is great for the price. Everything came faster than expected, and all pieces were present and working well."
2,Damaged Bike,"Bike arrived with considerable damage. Assembly was easy and straight forward. The broken rear stabilizer, case, and seat collar did not affect the performance of the bike. The operation of the bike is excellent. Very quite and with 10 precorded programs a lot of fun to ride. But until Schwinn learns how to package the bike for shipmanet I would not recommand buying this product."
4,Pleased in New Jersey,"I received my Schwinn 131 two days ago. I am very pleased so far. The variety of programs is wonderful. There is something for everyone. The machine is smooth and quiet. I would like it to be a bit bigger. I'm 6'1"", and I'm at the limit of the sizing adjustments. Assembly is pretty easy, and the tools are included. Although, if you have your own real tools, the task will go quicker.For the price, I highly recommend. Amazon has the lowest price, and free shipping.Edon"
5,Five Star poet,"Poetry that embraces the heart, mind, soul and bodyI felt every word of the author poemsI recommend that everyone read this book of poetry."
1,Droning book that is more his bias then about the topic,"Segevs attempt to portray Zionism Post or otherwise as it relates to Israels Amerikai fetish is labored. He attempts to link points in Israeli history to changes in the Zionist culture as the relate to the rise of American pop culture in Israel. Word Mr Segev. It has nothing to do with America and everything with you throwing your boring opiinon about Israeli poitics and politicans every other page.Cultures all over the world mimick those other cultures, that they find fun and interesting. It has nothing to do with Zionism and everything to do with human beings. Hassidic people still mimic a culture and lifestyle that is long gone and have no problem with it. Please spare us your personal opinions about he founder and ideology of the state. It matters not. Now go have a Tempo and a Time or Europa and chill out with a Gleeda Amerikai."
3,Not much Elvis here...,"I was disappointed with this one. No, I'm not a Graceland junkie, but I did expect at least a modest degree of accuracy from either the sensationalist title or subtitle. This is actually more of an academic essay that briefly discusses Zionism and its contingencies. Many different opinions are surveyed by the author, but there are very few ""man-on-the-street"" cultural observations and I didn't feel as if I knew any more about the ""Americanization of Israel"" after reading than I had before I began."
1,A man with all the spirituality of cardboard.,"Segev believes that the media generates the revolutionary ideas that move Israel forward. With that kind of ego, it's hard to imagine that Segev hears anything above the din of his own voice. Segev gets the reader lost in the semantics of post Zionism or post-post Zionism but ultimately, he offers no poetic vision of a people returning to their land, but a dry programmer's like outlook of building a country like developers put up a strip mall."
2,not a pulsing trance vocal track...,"this is a poor entry in the consistent singles released by ian van Dahl. If you have the album version, which is a rather simple dance tune to begin with, you also get that in an extended version. the last two tracks are breakbeat mixes, and track 3, the Peter lutz mix, is the best for lovers of female vocal trance. It's a little faster and more riff driven, but it's still not a real stomper."
4,Does what it says,"This short, very old, piece of information tells you exactly how to reasonably guess a cows age by inspecting its teeth. It should be useful to people who need to do this type of thing and do not know how. Despite being quite old information, the physiology of cattle could not have changed much in the last 100 years."
2,Good technical document but no diagrams.,There were none of the referenced figures. The information was pretty good though. Without pictures the book is of limited use to me.
5,As good as the PC version,"My wife and I have been playing the PC version for about a year now (well, mostly my wife) and I have to say that it works excellently on the GBA. I even find it a lot more fun for some reason. One way that it is better: you can get a code that automatically starts you at a higher level. Most of the puzzles in Puzzle Mode are different than the PC version, too, which is good because I'd solved all the PC ones.Our kids (age 7 and 5) like it, too, but I think I've played it the most, while my wife sticks with the PC version. It's too bad we only have two GBAs because now the three ""kids"" (including me) are fighting over them in the car. I might have to buy a second copy and a 3rd GameBoy for family harmony."
4,Summer read for preschoolers,This dimly-lit book shows children delighting in catching that perpetual favorite summer bug - the firefly (which I insist is a lightning bug). This was on a list of summer reads for preschoolers. Thumbs up.
3,just okay,"Bought these for roller derby. Promptly sent them back. Believe the reviews that say they are not high quality enough for derby, they aren't. I think that they would be fine for recreational skating, but not for a sport where you know you are going to get knocked down."
3,Not for Derby or big girls,"These are nice pads for regular skating, but these are not for derby or any real sport where your joints are gonna meet ground. Also, if you are over 200 lbs, don't bother!"
3,"Quality of material, Not of design.","I ordered a large size, and I'm a bit dissatisfied about the design, because the hard plastic part of the protecting pads are too big and flat, so they don't provide a good cup around the knee, but the stretch material that keeps it around your knees and elbows is too snug. The material is of great quality, but the design will certainly have to be modified."
2,Cheap looking,"I bought these for rollerblading, and had high hopes for these due to the reviews on amazon. But I had them sent back after 2 weeks of test driving them. I'm not picky by any stretch (I make my own protection pads for snowboarding), but these were really quite awful. The plastic protection pieces were flimsily tacked onto the Velcro pieces, and jiggled when I had them on. They were also uncomfortable and chunky. The fabric part is rough and causes blisters after a short use. Maybe they'll be more comfortable after a while, but from the looks of it, I doubt it would hold up to any long-term use."
5,Very well fitting,I bought this pad pack for my 9 year old. I was very worried because I didn't know much about how the sizing would work. They fit perfectly and easily on him and on my 12 year old daughter. The long velcro straps make for a perfectly safe fit every time.
4,For a starter Roller Derby set,"I still use the elbow pads. This was my first set a pads for playing Roller Derby. Once I started getting more aggressive on skates I quickly noticed I needed better knee pads. Everything else held up fine, especially for the price. I played for about a year before I purchased new wrist guards. If you know your going to be more aggressive, i.e. skateboarding, roller derby, you might want to think about spending more for better quality. I would recommend this set though, for starter derby girls on a budget (because I know how much starting out cost), and casual beach/park skaters (my girlfriend loves this set and she doesn't play derby). 4 stars for the knee pads.. not enough padding for falling a lotUse the DG sizing map it's pretty accurate."
3,Not too bad...,"A bit snug (especially the knee pads) on a thin-framed tall 8 year old. He wears them, but it's a challenge for him to get them on/off."
4,Nice Pads,"Excellent 3 piece pad pack for my carve board. Fits true to size, light weight and resistent. Good price value. delivered on time"
3,Trying to Find Chinatown,I like how the play starts a debate about two different racial views that are perceived among communities. The play was very inclined to promote profane language to get the point across by the different characters on the play. It was very interesting to learn so much about a particular culture in diverse and entertaining way. =D
1,Dragonfly earrings,"These are very small and were badly bent on arrival. I was able to fix them, but I'm not happy with them. They were intended as a gift, now I'm not sure."
1,Disappointing,"The cover photo by Eric Boutilier-Brown is one of the best images shown. While this book may be helpful to the beginning photographer of outdoor nudes, I found the lighting information to be very basic. The selection of mostly color images is largely uninspiring, and includes a number of kitschy photos that may look fine on someone's web page, but hardly belong in a book. There are a few truly excellent images, but they are not worth the price of the book in my opinion."
5,I can't wait to read the rest of the series!,"Reading about Marilyn's ""adventure"" was great, even if this story wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. It was more of the kind of story that makes you think about what's lurking in the shadows, or what's waiting for you under the bed...Bruce Coville has a knack for writing believable dialog, and for illustrating scenes as clearly as if they were on a screen in front of you. This book was easy to read, and good...what more could you ask for?"
5,BEST B-DAMAN EVER,This B-Daman is the best. It has awesome aim and power. The only thing is that the stickers come off. It is great for accuracy and rapid fire combined. I once bet 5.00$ and I won the battle(it was a shoot the gap match). I like the design of it. Please buy it.
4,Free LOADER!!! I GOT RIPPED OFF!!!!!,"Two days ago i purchased bakuso, and now they give a FREE LOADER with it!!! That is jacked up!!! Bakuso is a good bdaman, so this is a very good deal. Get them before they are all gone!!!PS: I want a loader.........PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Blue Dragon bakuso,bakuso is very good it has good accuracy but it hasn't got to much power but if you costumize it with ligtling kahn it will be more powerful. but after a few weeks you will find it borring but you can buy the accuracy game that cost 12pounds and 99pence and you can also costumize with rekuso and it makes bakurekuso.
3,"2 combo,and good information","If you have this bdaman, you also have the basic.I put the loader on my best bdaman, cobalt blade DHB.To make the horns stick, put them the right way. Justlook at the box. The barrel is cool, and it looks that waytoo! I highly recommend this. Buy it!"
4,Versatility at it's best,Although gangstar has been doing this for eons this album may sound a bit different from the masterminded monotone and godlike scratches and samples from the Guru and Premier-duo. But If you own Moment of Truth(98) Guru lets you know that they have evolved with the times and the ol' school rap contained in this album seems to be going through a transformation in the years that this album was produced. Overall they have evolved and are the best at what they do. Keeping rap real and protected from propaganda and Big Business that alot of rappers tend to live by now a days.
3,The Beginning of Two Legends,"I'll admit I'm not crazy about the entire album - in fact I'm not crazy about most albums that were released between '87 and '89 because the songs (other than the hit singles) sound dated. But since Gang Starr is one of the greatest groups in hip hop history, this album should be in your hip hop library. ""Manifest"" - both the original and the remix (the sped up version) are worth the album in itself."
4,Gangstarr Classic,"Anybody who loves Gangstarr must seek out their first CD! This is a hip-hop classic album! Tracks to listen for are first and foremost the title track, then 'Premier and the Guru','Manifest', 'Cause and Effect' and '2 Steps Ahead'. I can't say enough about this CD, except that your Gangstarr collection will NOT be complete without it."
4,A good start,"I still have this cassette which got major airplay on my car stereo back in the spring/summer of 1990 (released late 1989). It was definitely a transition into a new defining sound - the fusion of jazz and hip hop. Lyrically, Guru hadn't hit his peak yet but the beats by DJ Premier are infectious. Laced with jazzy melodies, quick drum patterns and some serious turntablism you can't help but not bob your head to the sounds. I personally prefer this to Step in the Arena and The Ownerz but its definitley a notch below Daily Operation, Hard to Earn and Moment of Truth. I'd recommend it to any fan of mid school hip hop and to any Gang Starr fan."
2,Not Quite GangStarr,"If you own ""Hard to Earn"" or ""Moment of Truth,"" you know the combination of Guru's monotone flow and DJ Premier's herculian production talents make for amzing music. If you're fortunate enough to own ""Step in the Arena"" or ""Daily Operation,"" this comes as no surprise. But ""No More Mr. Nice Guy""...well, let's just say that it's akin to a GangStarr demo. Guru ""Keithy E."" sounds sqeaky and DJ Premier's tracks sometimes hit (""Manifest"" ""Premier and the Guru""), but mostly miss(""2 Steps Ahead"" ""Gotch U""). This album is for die hard fans only."
2,Old School Vs. New School,"The problem this album runs into is it's undying need to reflect the old school beats of yesteryear.Lacking on this release is the innovative beats that are to follow. Guru's rhymes are fine for this album, but lack the importance that fit the future albums.Premier had yet to find his niche in the rap game, and it could not be more evident if he had tried. At a time that De La was on top, Gang Starr was lacking in it's primitive grooves.There are a few exceptions (most notabely ""Words I Manifest""), but overall, this is an album for die-hards only."
4,Latin rap-reggae with plenty of hooks and melody,"Although this album has no commercial hits like ""Rica Y Apretadita"" (Rich and a Little Tight), ""Damelo"" (Give It To Me), or ""Pata Pata"", there are enough great tunes to make it more than worthwhile. The songs that Anayka guest-sings are in general the best on the album -- she takes the chorus, El General raps in between. On ""Una Fiesta"", she sings ""lo que a una fiesta puede a ser -- enamore' otra vez"". Other songs, such as ""El Clavo"" (The Nail) and ""Rapa Pan Pan"" may not immediately stand out, but over a few listens the hooks sink into your brain. In an age of recycled 1980s tunes, it's a nice change to hear a rapper who writes all his own material, adds a little melody and chorus, and is socially conscious (see ""Poema II""). Think Neneh Cherry, but Panamanian."
4,One of the best chewables!,"These are my choice for my Calcium Citrate chewables. I have tried two other brands and this one is the best. It has a slight hint of orange juice flavor (not overpowering) and isn't the best mixed formulation ever (you see the orange flakes on the pills!), but compared to the rest of the bunch it is like a gourmet meal! Spread your 500 mg dose out so you chew two tablets at least 2 hours apart for maximum absorption (total of 4 tablets per day). Calcium Citrate is roughly six times more soluble in water than Calcium carbonate, which is especially important for people with malaborption issues due to stomach/intestinal issues (volume or acid production), or people who have trouble taking pills."
1,Warning - High dose of sugar alcohol,"I seriously doubt that I'm the only person out here who cannot tolerate sugar alcohol - it causes severe intestinal pain. While I should have suspected it, the product description does not let you know that these supplements have a very high dose (at least for me) of sorbitol, a sugar alcohol. I was unable to use them and had to give them away."
3,Extremely Sour,"I found the tablets to be so sour that I couldn't take them. I can't recommend them for anyone with high acid levels, gastritis, GERD etc. because they will likely irritate your digestive tract like they did mine. But if you're someone who enjoys very sour candies you'll probably love these."
4,Good product.,"Chewable calcium citrate is not an easy product to find, and I appreciate that this company produces it.This is a good product, MUCH better than two others that I have tried (and discarded). It has a rather sharp citric acid flavor but is tolerable, otherwise I would have given 5 stars."
3,has anybody ever seen this book,hey i was just interested in this obscure book because some of the art work from it was in the cover of an obscure band called Mr bungle and i thought that it was kinda out there and cool...or somthing like that. if anybody knows where i can find the book or has seen it before write me a review letting me know where i can get ahold of it
3,I don't even have it!!!,"Wow, plenty of Mr Bungle Fans, I thought we were rarer than this. I was just trying to find ""Cotton Candy Autopsy"" cos I have the Mr Bungle album and I think the Art is really interesting and Crazy... oh well, ....My Bum is on the Swedish... Swedish..."
5,Take me to this cafe!,"I purchased this puzzle as a gift. The recipient was extremely pleased as it is true-to-life, vibrantly colored, relatively challenging (1,000 pieces), yet fun for kids or a family to assemble. The picture is so real it tempts you to want to be in the picture/puzzle! Great choice!"
1,I WOULD RATE 0 BUT THERES NO OPTION,PLEASE DONT BUY......Just like to say my wife and i had this extinguisher and my wife was cooking and started a fire on the stove. When i retrived the extinguisher i followed the steps to the T and when i pushed on the button it broke so i could not use it so we had to leave the house while we watched our kitchen burn
1,Sold to me then cancelled as unavailable!!!,"How can you sell an item to someone, then tell them you don't even have it. My daughter was counting on this and so was I."
3,okay product,"does exactly what ir says it does. crazy loud alarm! had it for a long time. still works I would suggest that every house had at lwast this model or even a better, more accurate one. this one sufficiently works tho"
1,Absolute JUNK!,"You need to replace the battery every month. The ""low battery"" goes off between 1am and 2am. It has never gone off at a normal hour. DON'T BUY THIS JUNK!"
1,piece of junk,"The unit didn't work since day one. When plugged into the wall, it went through self test and then immediately buzzed off at 85db. Not worth it."
1,More trouble than it's worth,Same problem as several other reviewers. Random false alarms at not so nice times of night. Total and complete waste of money.
5,Great warning system,"I've had one of these plugged in at every home I've lived in for the past 15 years. They say to replace them every 5 years; we've gone 6 or so before replacing. They work well, and if you do get an alarm, you can immediately check the levels it is seeing, of find out if it is just a bad sensor. Feel safer knowing this monitor is sniffing out the carbon monoxide for me and my family."
5,Worry Free for the Last 9 years,"I purchased this unit in November 2002. Tested each year and was always in operational order. Replacement of the internal backup battery was done when alerted to do so. Today, the alarm with Err code displayed, and a quick review of the manual (searched using Google) indicated a component error. Time to replace the unit. I will happily do so with the same unit. I definitely received piece-of-mind and my money's worth these past 9 years."
3,Plan to replace in 5 years,"This is a good high quality carbon monoxide alarm, but plan to replace after five years. The typical sign of failure is chirping every 30 seconds with an error code of ""E09"". Kidde product support confirms that under these conditions the alarm has reached the end of it's effective life."
5,Saved My Life,"This instrument saved my life recently during a power outage. When the power went out my gas furnace was operating at maximum. This caused the electric blower to stop suddenly. The furnace was full of hot air, gas, partially combusted gas and carbon monoxide which had no place to go except into the room air. My Nighthawk CO alarm, which has a battery backup, alerted me to the potentially lethal situation and I was able to open the windows. Never go to sleep without it."
4,The battery problem can be fixed.,"My unit was eating batteries, too.Called Kidde and they got me a replacement."
1,Short life cycle and poor customer support,"I have tried these alarms for the last couple of years and now see a trend. These devices last about a year, then display ERR message. The ERR message basically says, ""time to buy another one so we can continue our revenue stream."" Not satisfied with this product at all.And stay away from the 'Just Answer' web site... another money making scam."
1,10 yr old carbon monoxide detector,"I work at a local gas utility company. I respond to gas leak and carbon monoxide emergency calls. We are trained that if a CO detector is over 7 yrs old it should be replaced, that's why I went to buy a new one for my house. I ordered this one and when I got it I found it was made in February of 2001! Ten years old!!Older than the 1 I was replacing. So I thought since it was still in the package it maybe would be OK. So I replaced the expired in 2005 battery that came with it and tried it. Sure enough it went off during the night with a error code. I am going to buy 1 locally. I recommend you not to buy 1 unless the seller can tell you how old it is."
5,Good replacement,Had a First Alert detector for almost 10 years that decided to display 30 all the time. After some researching I read that these should be replaced at least every 7 years. Read that many of the First Alert units had problems right out of the package so Kidde was my next choice. I wanted another plug in unit and this also has battery back up and different mounting options. Had it about a month now and everything is working well. You can find this in local stores like Walmart but even with shipping I still saved about $4 off their price through Amazon. I'm well satisfied with the detector and price I paid..
5,Just what I wanted,Excellent product - Had a previous one and wanted a second for the basement.Everyone should have a couple of these to protect themselves.
3,BEWARE OF SHELF LIFE OF PRODUCT,"I started receiving an err code on the unit earlier this afternoon. I call KIDDE...the company in the owners manual that is given to call when you receive the err code. The first question asked is what the date is on the back of the unit. Mine is stamped July 2003. The lady informed me that the sensors are only good for 6-7 years.....so my unit is longer ""good"". Looks like I will be replacing my unit because of this.... just wish I would have known there is only 6-7 year life span on the Nighthawk carbon monoxide detector."
1,Totally agree about falses,This thing false alarms so much it is useless. There is no way to keep it plugged in because it goes off once or twice a week. Do yourself a favor - give it a pass.
5,CO detector,"This is the best reasonably priced CO detector out there. When we had a problem with a leak coming through from next door, this detector had close to the same readings as the Gas. Company's much more expensive model. I just bought them all again to replace our same model, older ones."
1,Garbage for high price,"What the heck? The ""includes battery"" for all three packages of my purchases (3 separate) were dead! Whatever,the plug was too thin to stay in my plug socket; falls out! What crap! Okay, it shows CO concentration real time... Does it?I'm thinking lawsuit city here: who knows what it actually shows? Do not buy this piece of junk! Time for a class actionlawsuit IMO!"
2,Terrible Packaging,"I purchased 5 of these CO detectors. I expect them to work fine. But, they were packaged in a flimsy cardboard box with very little protection. The box was partially open and the detectors could have easily fallen out. I hope they will all work properly. The packaging was very uncharacteristic for Amazon. A paperback book is packaged in a bullet proof box, but delicate equipment was basically just thrown in a weak box."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased the Kidde Model KN*COPP-3 Carbon Monoxide Alarm on 12/04/2004. As far as I know it has been working fine until yesterday 1/08/2012 it started beeping every 30 seconds at 2:00AM. I was getting an ""ERR"" message. I Called Kidde the next day and was told that the unit was designed to have a 7 year life and then had to be replaced ? ? ? I will not buy a $40.00 unit again considering they have to be replaced every 7 years. If I have to throw one away I would prefer that it be a cheap one."
1,Does not seem to work,"I have had one of these (Kiddie Nighthawk) for several years. It always displays 0. A few days ago I decided to test it by turning on a gas burner and holding it about 1.5 feet above it with the stove vent off. After 5 minutes it still showed 0. I left it on my stove while I proceeded to cook dinner with the stove vent still off. Still no change. If this item does not work, it is giving people a false sense of security, and will not protect them. I had a Cousin die and her daughter almost die from carbon-monoxide poisioning (they did not have a detector)."
1,Nice Paperweight,Battery lasts about 3 or 4 weeks. You will get tired of replacing the battery after a while and it will likely turn into a paperweight on your desk.
5,Exactley what you need in a Carbon Monoxide detector,"Was looking for a quality all in one Carbon Monoxide detector and this is it. It runs on AC, plugs right into the wall, has a 9v battery backup (*BONUS*battery was included) and has a digital display so you know it is working. Price was excellent and I would gladly recommend this to other people."
1,Worst ever,"I bought the first one which gave a false alarm after a month, replaced it as per the company's instructions, plugged in the new one, which gave off an alarm immediately. (""Gas"", which is not in the manual). Called 911 both times, both times the fire dept said CO levels in my house and building was zero. According to the fireman, his detector cost $500 and said zero, mine cost fifty. Draw your own conclusion. He told me, ""Go to Home Depot and buy what they recommend. Return this one."""
2,Failure,"I have had two fail. The first failed alarm I swithced around the house and discarded it because it was the 1/3 that did not work. This unit was replaced with a new one from McLendon Hardware about 3 months ago and its failure (a constant signal that could not be silenced without removing the battery--(a return for warrenty item according to Kidde). The failure resulted in a call to Fast Water Heater who responded within 1 1/2 hours as they installed a new heater about 5 months ago. They found nothing and charged nothing. The failure in not reasonable for a company who did a great job installing my water heater and their expense , but which caused fear and inconvenience for my family. After Fast left, I Googled and found the problem. The unit still fails outside in abient air. I should have checked this before calling Fast, but never believed that 2 units would be defective."
5,CO Monitor,Excellent product. I used it before for more than seven years and I would recommend it to anyone who is for protecting the house and its inhabitants against carbon moonoxide poisoning.
3,kidde nighthawk co2,"worked ok for 5 years then all of asudden it started acting wacky . i would put a brand new battery in and 2 days later it would beep (at 2am of course) saying it needed a battery . please keep you receipt , some of these have a 7 year warranty ."
2,This Company's products are really not good quality,"I have had like 3 of these things. They all break. One did last 5 years, but lat one I had lasted 6 months. I called customer service and got nothing but a hard time. I had to yell to get a supervisor to finally get a return. This women said since I was not using the same outlet in which I had originally had the problem , that she couldn't help me. My blood boiled. But, I eventually did get an RMA. Made in China Poor Quality. This company has a virtual monopoly. I am going to look for another brand."
3,Kinda hard to rate this product,"How do you rate a product that you hope will never have to perform as designed? It's kind of a case where if it doesn't do its job we'll be dead and won't ever be able to write a bad review! This one was ordered to replace an existing, identical model. Manufacture date was March 2011 so we'll get about 6-1/2 years of use out of it. This product is another China import - I hope Kidde is doing some serious quality control, as my experience with China imports demonstrates inconsistent quality of production."
3,"False Alarms, but great warranty & hassle free Customer Service","I JUST barely sent an email to this company about the bad battery life and false alarms I was getting with this particular device. SINCE it was still under it's 5 year warranty they are sending me a new device in 7-10 days...hardly any questions asked. So, as far as customer service is concerned I'd give it 5 stars, the device itself, still unsure about. I have yet to really know if this device WORKS properly as I have only been using it a few months."
5,Saved my life last night,"I can't speak for the other reviewers on here - maybe some of the complaints about this unit are valid. However, I can only say that this unit saved my house, and maybe my life, last night. My water heater pilot light went out, and a faulty thermocouple failed to shut off the gas. My basement filled with combustible gas.While this unit is not a combustible gas detector, the alarm sounded. It was loud enough for me to hear upstairs and I was able to shut off the gas and ventilate the area. I don't know what would have happened if I didn't have a detector. I am trying not to think too hard about it.If you don't have a detector, go buy one today. They are cheap, and many units (like this one), require ZERO installation. You have no excuse not to have one. You wouldn't live in a house without a smoke detector, and you shouldn't live in a house without a CO detector either."
4,Kidde KN-COPP-3 Nighthawk Plugin Carbon Monoxide Alarm,"Was recommended this product by my neighbor as I have a gas stove and gas fireplace. Read the other reviews and am concerned about others experiencing the unit to start beeping after a couple of months. So far, I have it plugged in and it has been on for about 1 month. It is working as expected. Will update review if it starts malfunctioning.P. Trueax04/12/09Washington, DC"
1,Burns thru batteries even when plugged in,Be prepared to have to replace the 9-volt every 4-6 weeks. Burns thru the battery even when plugged in
1,Eats batteries like it's starving,"I bought this unit because we have a fireplace. While the unit appears to work detecting carbon monoxide, as another reviewer noted it drains batteries like no tomorrow. The battery in this unit is certainly NOT used for backup. We just went through a 4 day power outage and the unit drained batteries every 4 to 6 hours. We had to keep replacing them as we were using our fireplace as our only meager source of heat. Even with AC power the battery still only lasts for maybe a month. I'm very disappointed in this model, especially since I paid good money for it."
1,poor design,"I've owned two CO detectors from Kidde. One was a plug-in model, the other was battery only. Both were easily the most frustrating devices I've owned, very poor design."
1,Doesn't work,"The pilot light had gone off right under its nose, and the alarm never went off. I smelt the gas, but the detector didn't."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"Bought one of these at one of those big box home stores. After about two months of use in a bedroom the thing started going off. Public service found nothing wrong and the other two older detectors were not detecting anything. Took it back and exchanged it and the new one started going off for no reason too. Public service again checked and found nothing, told me they'd had several other similar calls lately. These things are either defective by design or break down easily so if you want to sleep at night DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!!!!"
2,Works....for about 2 years,"I have purchased three of these (one a replacement) and they appear to work fine. Assuming it works(?) the actual numeric display of the level of CO in the air is reassuring (removes the ""well, no alarm, so I guess it's working"" doubts). My only issue has been with the product lifespan. Two units worked for only about two years, then displayed error messages which indicate the units had to be replaced. They're not exactly cheap, so replacement is expensive. After 5 years, I would expect to have problems; malfunctions after 2 years...something's not quite right."
2,Constant false alarm and battery warning beeps,"After about a year or so, the thing started to beep for no reason once in a while. It doesn't do it all the time... just about once or twice a day. The display would read ""LB"" (low battery) even though the battery was just put in a few hours before."
1,An absolute piece of crap!,"This thing malfunctioned in the dead of night and displayed a ""gas"" warning. So like an idiot, I replaced it with the less-expensive, CO-only model. It, too, was a p.o.c. and malfunctioned in the dead of night. Never again."
1,Tossed it in the garbage at 2:45am,"I will not buy Kidde again.I bought one of these and it false alarmed many times. I got a replacement from Kidde, and it does the same. I moved all around the house trying to find where it would work OK. I finally got fed up at 2:45am last night and threw it away. It was saying gas, there was no gas. I have another older AC powered CO detector and it has gone off only once in many years and that seemed to be from highway pollution."
1,started going off on On GAS at all hours,"after having this a year it started going off on On GAS at all hours ""ALSO AT NIGHT TOO WHICH IS VERY SHOCKING"" has my house checked, no gas present."
1,"Yes, it is a piece of crap.","I purchased this detector about 8 months ago, and just have others said there is an issue with battery drain and false alarms--as I discovered in the middle of the night. The major issue now is the constant ""ERR"" code that comes up causing the unit to beep LOUDLY. I have since disconnected it. The manufacuter date on the back is July 2006 and if the sensor is ""dead"" what the heck is the point of buying something so unreliable? Save your money and patience and find something more reliable."
1,WAY too sensitive,"Had a gas stove burner on but the flame blew out- detector never even beeped. However, if you use Windex or Lysol anywhere in the house, it will go off and not quit. Total waste of batteries and effort."
3,Kidde KN-COPP-3,There's a confusing warning in the instruction leaflet saying it wasn't tested for detection of CO levels below 70 ppm. In fact it's very sensitive: I found the peak level registers (typically 10 ppm) if just one burner on a gas range runs for about 15 minutes - the alarm is in a different room....only the fact that the alarm is unusable without a battery is a serious drawback. I would have given it 5 stars if it ran off AC only without the useless battery backup feature or if the same company made a detector without the battery backup but still having a digital readout.
3,Kidde CO detector,"The CO detector basically works well. I like the digital readout and the fact that low levels of carbon monoxide (CO) can be detected and read by pushing the display button. High, dangerous levels are shown automatically.A negative is that the detector suffers from being vulnerable to radio frequency interference. I'm a ham radio operator who occasionally transmits at high, 500 to 1000 watt power levels. When transmitting, the detector is set off. Kidde offers no solutions except to say that it shouldn't be happening.Keep in mind that all of these detectors have a 5 year life. A undocumented ""feature"" is that they will go dead approximately 5 years after first being plugging in. The detecting device's life is for 5 years."
3,Lasted 5 years then started false alerts in the middle of the night,"Not sure why the middle of the night is when this decides to produce a false alert. but according to other reviewers that seems to be the pattern. it did last us 5 years and we didn't have the battery issues that others identified. Last night at 1am it decided to wake us up with a PPM of 999, clearly a false alert, since we werent dead and didnt die. its the end of the summer and nothing in the house was on to even produce CO."
5,"Already owned one, bought this for college apartment",We already have this product in our home (9 years). I purchased another one for my child's off-campus college apartment.
1,totally unhappy,"I bought a Kidde KN-COPP-3 Nighthawk Plug-In Carbon Monoxide Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display. In less than a month we had to change the battery twice. Both times the alarm woke us up during the night ruining our sleep. We first thought it detected a CO leak, but then we noticed that the alarm showed the ""lb"" message: low battery. I just disconnected it."
1,"Looks nice, but eats batteries every 1-2 months...","I own two of these CO2 detectors, and after having both for just over 6 months, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.I have already replaced the batteries on both 3-4 times, and that is without any power outages in that time. According to the manual, the battery is a backup and is only used when there is a power outage. This is not true... If the unit won't function without a charged battery installed, it's being used all the time.In my case, this has been an expensive lesson to learn that Nighthawk / Kidde products aren't as good as they used to be."
1,"Long on Legend, Short on Facts","This book contains many well-worn 'facts' that have circulated for years, and have been debunked long ago, including ""the reason people say 'Cheers'"" mentioned in the canonical review above, the origin of the word ""posh,"" and ""kings in decks of cards are based on historical kings.""Don't trust anything in this book, which seems to have been created by collecting and sorting hundreds of e-mailed lists of apocrypha."
5,Comprehensive and exciting,"This book has questions and answers that cover every conceivable topic. Be prepared for a surprise if you thought nothing interesting existed in the world of mathematics, for instance. My family enjoyed it immensely."
5,THE best Moisturizer EVER!,It's true - if you are wondering if you'll like it and if all these reviews are for real - take the plunge - you won't regret it!I use this moisturizer under makup and it is fabulous!My face looks dewy and fresh - and I have extremely dry skin.Try it - you'll love it!
4,love it,"first time using this product, it came in the mail so fast, and it smells and feels amazing. will buy in the future"
5,The BEST!,"I've been using Skin Trip for 15 years! It super light, smells delicious (but not over powering),and makes my skin nice and soft. It's the only thing I've ever been able to use on my face without breaking out or seeming greasy. Probably because it's all natural and so light. I used to order it direct off their site in a big giant container, but unfortunately their prices went way up, so I haven't used it in awhile. The amazon price is cheaper, and free shipping. Yay!"
2,Really doesn't smell very good at all...,"This lotion smells great in the bottle. However after applying it, within only a few minutes it loses the great coconut smell and takes on a very funky odor.I bought this for my wife for X-mas. We both love the smell of a good coconut lotion. However she seemingly hasn't used it and when I finally asked why, she told me about the smell. Sure enough, we tried it on a few other volunteers and everyone said the same thing.This lotion is light, and doesn't feel greasy after applying it - so it has that going for it. For all I know it may be the best lotion in the whole world, it may have the power to end wars and cure cancer. But I'll never really know for sure, because there is no way we're using this odd smelling product."
2,Ugh. No.,"I wanted to like Mountain Ocean Skin Trip so badly. I use organic coconut oil all the time as a shave oil, for smoothing my hair, and on chapped lips. It's great, so I thought that Skin Trip would basically be that experience in lotion form.The lotion is nice as far as moisturizing properties, the texture is good, and it absorbs in to my skin quite well but the added fragrance is overpowering, sickeningly sweet, and just unnecessary. I can't smell like a Baskin Robbins all day, it's just too migraine-inducing. Someone call me when they make a perfume-free version. It would be different if this literally smelled like coconut -it is after all one of the main ingredients, but it has been heavily scented. I somehow doubt that this is an 'original' formula, especially given the silicones etc on the ingredient list. Don't be fooled by the cute hippie-style labeling, there's not very much that is 'natural' about this product."
1,Smell is Offensive,"I have been looking for the perfect coconut lotion for a while and decided to give this one a try after reading some of of the reviews. Sadly, the smell was just too offensive for me and I had to immediately wash it off. It does not smell ""coconutty"" - or fruity, it just has a very strong and overpowering unnatural and offensive scent. Sorry ..."
4,wood paste,"I used this paste on antique furniture and it made the furniture look new. It does clump and dry in corners, but you can go back and clean it out. I love the product!"
5,Perfect finish.. every time.,"I can't say enough good stuff about Briwax. The smell is a little off putting, but the job this stuff does is incredible. I have used this wax for nearly all my refinishing projects and it has always resulted in a nice, smooth surface. I originally purchased this in hopes it would be comparable to Annie Sloan's soft wax, and to me it is just as good."
4,Clear is great.,"Good stuff. I knew of it from seeing lots of beautiful Irish furniture exported and stripped of bright paint. Lovely hard but silky finiish.Yes, be careful of gases but it does dry quickly."
1,Briwax order feedback,What upset about this Briwax order was that the postage default was not set at standard ground service. I was not in a hurry for this product and did not appreciate the extra postage expense.
3,If it wasn't for Bill Wyman..........,"If it wasn't for Bill Wyman's name,this would be just another cd by a decent bar band doing 'covers'. I'll probably keep it in the collection just to round off the dossier of other solo efforts by the Stones. I wasn't offended but I wasn't dazzled either. If you're really interested in a great effort by a Rolling Stone, look for Keith Richards's Expensive Winos. All three cds are excellent."
2,Not the stickers you remember from the 80s,"These stickers came packaged together, even though they had a variety of scents. Consequently, they all smelled like a fruity bubble gum when I opened them. Remember the scratch and sniff stickers of the 80s that held their individual scents for years? These aren't them."
5,Great value,I will be using these as incentives for my reading groups this year and I think they are a great value. I highly recommend them.
3,Makes me wonder,"Some of his translations are... Odd. This book makes me wonder about early scholarship, and how much we should rely on it as we delve deeper into archeology and our understanding becomes clearer."
4,It was cool,"I liked this book, but the only thing was at the end I wanted Jake and Cassie to kiss, I mean they have only done it once before, and that was in book #26! But otherwise it was good. I really recomend it ;-)"
4,Why The Outback???,"I love the book. It's better than the others that KAA has written lately, by far. But why do people automatically think of the outback when they think of Australia?"
4,Annes Rubbermaid Reveiw,"This Rubbermaid broom is really nice. At my house, one of my chores is sweeping (I'm 13). This broom is really durible and easy to sweep with. The one we had before it would be hard to manuver and a couple of weeks after we got it, it snapped. This broom makes my sweeping much easier and I don't have to worry about it breaking or doing a bad job. Thanks Rubbermaid!"
4,Their last great album,"This was Great White's last great effort. Though it takes a back seat to Once Bitten, Twice Shy and Hooked, it still has that classic blues/rock sound. Russell's vocals are still top notch and Kendall, Lardie and Desbrow bring the rock as always. This is a highly under rated album that deserves your attention."
1,Damaged Goods,This CD should not have been sold. On track 1 there is a substantial scratch that causes it to stick there.
3,ot as good as expecting.,"The setting for the series was excellant and good actors, however I was disappointed by the stories-- too unreal and bordered on mystic. Also I found some of the relationships between the characters frustating. If I had it to buy over again I wouldn't. But still I do like the actors and I did like the first season one series."
2,disdistasteful,"If you enjoy watching shows where a majority of the characters eavesdrop, gossips, can't keep a confidence etc lark rise to candleford is the show for you.Dorcus Lane is the woman of character and example, she enjoys all of the above, must be involved in everything that has nothing to do with her.I wish I would have watched 1or 2 episodes before buying 3 seasonsDistasteful to me"
4,Another Great British Import,"We are big fans of Upstairs Downstairs, Duchess of Duke Street and Downton Abbey at our household and were happy to discover Lark Rise to Candleford. While perhaps not up to the level of the urban Elizabethan ""soap operas"", it does have an excellent cast, wonderful sets and a glimpse into life in the late 1800 just before the world started changing at a rapid pace. Very enjoyable series"
1,Make sure you know if your bluray player will accept this disc,"No where that I could find on the product description did it say ""won't play european disc on a north American player"". It should have. On the contrary it deceivingly said the main feature will play on ALL bluray players, but special features will be in standard def. I've searched and searched tech websites and they all said the same thing. European blurays from region B will not play on North American (region A) players. Anyone else have this problem? Had to return the discs because my Sony bluray player wouldn't play this imported bluray. It might be nice if this info was included in the product description. Save me some hassle."
5,Another addictive BBC show,"Firstly, I love seeing the historical aspect dramatized, as far as, the class hierarchy, & gender roles and, of course, the period wardrobes. The storyline follows a singular idea and is then brought around in clever circle while the characters is given am opportunity to grow."
5,A show for the family,"I love this show, it's something the whole family can watch. I'm so sick of violence, so this show is a breath of fresh air."
5,Larkrise,I love this series. The stories are so good. The acting is better. I will be very sad when the series is over. If you like good writing and acting this series is for you.
5,Amazing! Love it!,I loved it from beginning to end. I recommend it to everyone. Wish there was more cant get enough of it.
5,Absolutely captivating show,"I have watched bits and pieces of this show over the years but could never tie it all together. Well, getting the seasons as they started and grew has been such a delight.I love PBS shows in this era. It was a romantic and naive era that cannot be found today in most nations.Thanks for taking us back to this era in time."
5,Family appropriate tv show,"This is a sweet gentle series that a family can enjoy together. No car chases or violence ! The characters have genuine affection for each other. Fans of ""parenthood"" will also enjoy this show."
5,"A Clean, Enjoyable Series Set a Hundred Years Ago",Love period pieces that are clean- I dont have to cringe or worry that something disgusting is going to come up. Well acted. Easy to feel a part of the lives of the people.
4,Great Interpretations of Great Songs,"Pulled this CD out the other day for a listen--had forgotten how much I enjoyed it. Palmer released this a long time before it was fashionable for rock singers to cut standards albums, and he did his with great class and style. It's not the usual collection of songs, and the arrangements are very fresh and unique. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy the classics. Not your run-of-the-mill lounge singer act."
5,Great CD,This is an excellent underated album.This is surely great material in which to exhibit a wonderful voice.We miss this man.
2,Palmer misfires with standards,"Normally, these superb standards--Tender Trap, Witchcraft, Honeysuckle Rose-- are surefire hits for any artist. But in the hands of Robert Palmer they fail to sizzle. He gets points for being out of the gate early on putting together such a disc, which today is commonplace. But the attempt falls altogether flat."
1,CD Review,I was very disappointed listening to this CD. I expected a much better selection regarding high standard recordings.Patricia Bucino
5,Great Item,"Really amazing! does what it says I cant see how this could break its pretty heavy duty. Although I wouldnt recommend hooking it on your belt its still pretty heavy and moves a lot. Best spots are on your back pack or if you got a cool back pack with D rings on the straps hook them on there its great,"
2,Broke First Time Out,I had the ghost ring attached to one of my bags and at some point the metal clasp that opens did just that. Only it opened sideways somehow allowing the entire ghost ring to separate. I didn't notice it was gone until later. And later was when I wanted to attach a bottle of water only to find nothing to attach it to. so I never got a chance to see if it worked or not.
5,How to Write Letters for All Occasions by Sheff et al.,"This book is a gem. It is divided into two parts. The firstportion of the book deals with formal business letters andletterhead. The second portion of the book shows how tocompose personal letters and social letters. The book isperfect for just about any constituency includingbusinesspeople, students, immigrants unfamiliar with ourlanguage/customs, job-seekers and a host of other popularapplications. This work takes the worry out of letter-writing.Each proposed composition is centered, model salutationsare cited and proposed wording is provided for ease of use."
2,I need something of present generation,"well, this book is old and tore up, do not have enough examples of how to write letters. several occasions are missing ! need better than this."
2,"same album as ""Bad Girl""","There are many titles, but it's all the same album: Bad Girl, He's my brother, Portrait, Sexual feeling etc. It's an ok pop album but La Toya REALLY has much better stuff"
4,Worth the price,"These are really nice stickers. I bought them for two reasons. To replace the smelly stickers on or scratch and sniff Christmas book and for my homeschool co-op class. They are really not 'scratch n sniff' stickers. They just 'smell', if that makes sense. I can't say how long the scents will last, but the do smell. The honey does smell like honey, but for example it's not nearly as strong as the peppermint. These are the better choice with the free shipping offer. Other stickers that don't have free shipping, you're going to end up paying more for shipping than the stickers themselves."
3,What if you have lifted before?,"Strength Training Past 50 is a very good book and anyone past 50 who has an interest in fitness or has been directed by a physician to lose weight should read the book. The program in the book must be carefully followed, particularly the weight and repitition recommendations. This program was designed for a very broad age range and a broad range of physical fitness levels typically found in adults past 50. It's strength is that it is an excellent introduction to resistance training for those who have not lifted or have not lifted for a significant period of time. If you are 50 or older, male or female, and not an experienced lifter, you may expect to lose weight, gain muscle mass, energy, and a positive self image by following the program in this book."
1,title a little deceiving. Typical Westcott.,"I was looking for a book with information on training older adults. This book isn't about that... It is a book on general weight training with general programs and general guidelines. It's a typical Westcott book with a few pages of general guidelines and principles and a few program examples. The majority of the book is pictures of exercises which are absolutely useless if you own any other book on weight training and have a basic understanding of resistance training. If you know anything about weight training and exercise, don't buy this book."
2,Gross error all over the book!,"There is a gross error spread all over the book. The excercise called Lat pull-down can only be done with a machine, NOT with free weights, and yet it is widely recommended as an excercise with free weights all over the book. It does not make any sense. You would expect that a book written by two experts in the area would not contain just a gross error spread all over the book."
5,Great response,The response was immediate and the item was in the condition as advertised. I would purchase from the source again.
1,not as expected,This book is not for someone who has no access to machines. A lot of the book is devoted to the use of gym equipment. I was hoping for more instruction when there are no machines..or trainers....a basic book for beginners. This is not that book.
2,Not specific to those over 50,"This book is a good guide to beginning strength training for anyone. The book contains dozens of basic descriptions of machine and free weight exercises, listing muscle groups worked. However, I give this book only 2 stars because except for the title and a few charts, the book has little specific information for over 50 exercisers. Those looking for ways to tailor exercise routines for arthritis, or trying to decide which exercises stress joints the least will need to look elsewhere."
1,For Beginners Only,This book would probably help someone that does not exercise. My 71 yr old husband was disappointed because it was for a beginner.
2,Nothing out of the ordinary,I was looking for different strength training ideas for my older clients but this book didn't show me anything that I didn't already know. Very basic exercises. I needed new ideas for clients that don't move so easily and have a hard time navigating a bench/ball and the floor.
4,Works for Me,Pros: contains the info I needed. I am 66 years old and needed basic tools to start weight training.Cons: would have been nice if it has a little poster showing the exercises that I can pin on the wall for easy reference. I would not have to go flipping back on the pages.
2,Reads Like and Advert for Gyms,This book has nothing to do with being over 50. It is an exercise book written primarily around the use of gym weight machines.
4,Strength Training Past 50,This book has very good charts for strength traning of the whole body. It lists diffenent muscle groups and how to lift weights to strengthen that group. I would give it 5 stars if they had the page numbers of the diffenent exercises listed in the charts showing what muscle you need to exercise. You have to thumb through many pages to see how to do the exercise listed in the chart.
4,Simple Strength Training,Clear illustrations and explanations with simple routines that are easy to follow. Only been doing the program so difficult to assess how succesful the program is.
4,See what happens when he doesn't have to talk to Donaldson?,"Baseball carries a unique distinction from the other major sports in America because of its long history and stubborn resistance to change. Will understands this, and the pieces collected here in Bunts display both a genuine affection for, and a keen understanding of, our national pastime. Combining the sharp analysis and scholarship one expects from George Will with a surprising amount of humour and wit (who knew?), Bunts will quickly become a favorite of any baseball fan (and help many a non-fan understand what the fuss is all about). George Will - sentimental romantic. Go figure."
5,Excellent Bunt!,There is one thing I must say to George Will -- Please take into consideration being Baseball Commissioner. Bunts is splendid and Mr. Will knows the game as he knows politics -- good! He elegantly tells a baseball story like Sammy Sosa hitting one out of Wrigley. An excellent book that belongs on the shelf with the autographed Joe Dimaggio baseball.
3,It just didn't deliver.....,"The first 100 pages of Will's book was a simple retelling of stories from ""Men At Work."" In the end, the repetition and banality of a his writings made it far less enjoyable than his (or other authors') baseball books.On the plus side, the time-line of baseball events that he provides the reader proved interesting. I enjoyed watching the progression of the game through the two decades of his work.If you've read ""Men At Work,"" think seriously about passing this one by......You may find it redundant."
2,"too ""gwill"" opinionated and not enough objectivity","just because george says it, doesn't make it true. in my opinion george strayed from his usual objective baseball writing in this book. sorry george, this one didn't hit it out of reading rainbow park!"
5,"Baseball, Philosophy, Politics and Humor. What a treat!","George Will's ability to weave the fabric of Baseball into everyday life is incredible. I found myself wondering, after finishing this wonderful book, had read a book about Baseball or Mr. Will's philosophy of life? Bunts is a copulation of magazine and newpaper articles written by Mr. Will over the last three decades. His strings them together so that there is never an obvious seam and it flows as if it were written at one time. I found myself laughing constantly at the humor that is ever present in the game and magnified my Mr. Will's writing. If you are a fan of the ""worlds most wonderful game"" and if in addition you are a fan of Mark Twain's you will love this book. Thank you George Will."
4,Good -- But Others Are Better,"Has anyone else read _Off Base_ by Andrew Torrez? I think it has the wit and writing style of George Will, but also a fresh perspective that made me open my eyes and realize that a lot of what Will has to say has been said before.I guess that makes Will a ""baseball conservative"" as well as a political conservative."
2,No Cigar,"Aside from having improved on the audio there isn't much to recommend this product. The wide screen really isn't-some sort of substandard stretching technique was used. And even the audio suffers from the film being ""sped-up"" somehow, resulting in loss of nuance in the dialogue. I have another copy of this film thankfully-stick with the Image Entertainment version if you want quality."
2,Good anime poor dub,"I really loved this anime and wanted to buy it after watching online but afterwords I felt ripped off even though I spent only [...] The voice acting in my opinion was passable to horrendous and the translation was seriously horrible, for example the first episode has a masked wrestler as the opponent and they call him Rucha .... RUCHA! just because look whether the original Japanese said rucha or not it doesn't matter they meant to say lucha. You can go to the Japanese track with subtitles to avoid the voice acting but that does not change the poor transition.That brings me to the second point bland menus and no extras and not even a play all button or scene select whats up with that? The only thing other then the 4 episodes is the choice for language/subtitles.Over all if you're interested in this anime and want to check it out head over to [...]they have the entire series there with a good translation though no dub available."
5,Great Sleep,"When trying to get a good night's sleep I use melatonin, SOURCE NATURALS SUBLINGUALS. I have tried other brands but this is always the consistent brand. I tried orange flavor, it's ok but prefer peppermint . I knew that I was safe buying on amazon.com"
4,This is a good product but the peppermint flavor is too overpowering,"The sublingual Melatonin is ideal for traveling because it works almost instantly, so you can get to sleep faster than usual. I normally buy the orange flavored version and ended up with this peppermint one by accident (not paying attention), I found the taste much too strong and it seemed to create a burning sensation where I placed it under my tongue. I will stick to the orange version in the future."
4,It really helps me sleep,"There are times when I either ""miss my sleep train"" or just have too much on my mind, and 1/2 to 1 tablet of this melatonin, under my tongue, usually helps me drift off.And I don't feel groggy or ""drugged"" the next day.A very useful product."
4,Girl Biased,"The movie was great, but it was biased towards boys. I would reccomend this for anybody to learn what determination means."
1,No return on defective item,Buyer beware. This extingisher arrived partially discharged. Amazon considers this hazmat and will not accept a return for replacement.
1,Waste of Paper,"I am a big fan of ethnobotany and Amazon stories but this is pathetic. She gets nearly no medicines on her journey, ends up chasing Indians around becuase she never meets them, and has racial slurs (published in 1961 originally) about how suprised she is that the Indians are not savages and unpolite ,etc.. She actually says that one Indian was the 'best looking male animal she has seen' Insane. Not a good book."
1,What a disgrace to our breed!!!!!!,"I ordered this book to see if my dog was in it along with severaly friends dogs who had all paid a good price to have their dogs featured as new Champions. Upon receipt of the ""book"", I was horrified to see a compiliation of xerox copied photos which had been submitted in color. There are only a few dogs featured, some other printed information which is not particularly interesting and a whole bunch of ""fillers."" One would think for the price of the book you would get more than a spiral bound poor quality paper report. I wish I could say more about the contents but there is nothing interesting or substantial there. It is sad that the dogs were presented that way after the owners had spent so much time, love and money to get them to be Champions."
2,not as expected,"This book is far from what I've expected. I adore animals and I have many of them. Of course that I feel great when I spend my time with them. They are good friends. One of the problems with this book is that the author didn't use the right title; the appropriate title would be "" Animals as our friends"". The book is actuallly the collection of different stories which the author received from many different people. And, in every story we can see just a good relationship between humans and animals.I've expected to find out in what way animals could be ""used"" in some particular treatments. I know that there are some clinics where animals are good ""medicaments"" for mental patients and not only for them. For example people could soothe their pain in arms or legs with the help of their pets. The pets could lie on the painful spot and their positive energy could reduce the owner's pain or even cure him. So, I've expected that kind of stories..."
5,Valuing the Roles of Animals in our Lives,"The author, Susan McElroy, uses her successful fight against cancer as the backdrop for this inspirational work. She credits her animal companions for much of the strength and wisdom she needed to be a cancer survivor.McElroy's way of combining stories and analyzing them makes this more than just a collection of sweet pet stories. It helps you recognize the important role animals play in our lives. The inspiration, hope, love and of course bittersweet emotions we've all felt with our animals are all stirred up when reading this book. She also devotes time to the wild animals that touch our lives, even if just fleetingly.Animals as Teachers and Healers is highly recommended for everyone who's life has been changed by the love of an animal."
4,Good backpack,"Useful for laptops! The only thing that I did not like was the color. I did not really like the grey-black-yellow layout, I wish they had brighter colors. But it is a good backpack."
5,A fascinating and diverse compendium of historical trivia,"The Ladies Room Reader: The Ultimate Women's Trivia Book is a fascinating and diverse compendium of historical trivia concerning women's issues and experiences. From marriage, to pets, to favorite foods, to sex, this remarkably informative 306-page book offers a wealth of amazing and surprising statics, such as 57% of women reporting that they would rather go shopping than have sex. From makeup (the wearing of which goes back at least 8,000 years) to inventions (the dishwasher was invented by a socialite who was discouraged about the job her hired help was doing on her dishes), The Ladies Room Reader is ideal for browsing and would make for a fun and educational addition to personal, women's studies and popular culture reading lists."
2,Seems backwards to me,"I don't really understand Burkett's thesis at all. It seems to me that raising future generations is a social obligation. Someone has to do it. One could reasonably argue that society ought to pay all of the costs of raising children. Instead, in our society, 90% of the costs and the work are borne by those who volunteer to be parents.Burkett does a reasonable job of analyzing how society subsidizes child raising in various rather minimal ways. But our taxes subsidize research, oil exploration, military defense, and all sorts of other things that are socially desirable. If your house catches fire, taxes pay a hundred percent of the cost of putting out the fire, not just a small fraction. As long as raising children costs more than the financial benefits (and it certainly does, by a long shot), why should we think that those subsidies are too large? Burkett doesn't have a reason."
1,*Sigh*,"I remember before I became a parent and those that were already would tell me I had no idea how it would change my life and I thought to myself, ""oh yeah, right. I've got a good imagination."" But they were oh so right. I had no clue! Kind of like the author to this book. American is family-friendly? News to the rest of us! Maybe there are some inequities, and some frustrating imbalances where the author did her research, or where some of these other reviewers live, but everywhere I've looked being a parent costs a great deal of power and possibility. Parenting is about the larger spiritual picture of humanity. If children are important, it's because what this world is like ten, fifty, and a hundred years from now is more important than any one life today. With such ignorance, luxury, and malevolence this author writes!"
1,Insulting!,"HI, I chose not to have children by choice and to suggest that some companys are cheating the childless is insulting. I have read part of this book and had to put it away cause I felt sick after reading it."
3,"Right Points, Wrong Tone","Burkett makes a number of excellent points in this book: For instance, child income tax credits are a feel-good measure that benefit the middle-class instead of the kids that need it the most. The federal government is paying people to do something that they've been doing forever, and people who don't have kids are left holding the bag. Also, people with kids often get a better job benefits package than those without: on-site daycare in some places, maternity leave, flextime, etc., and picking up someone else's slack is infuriating.As a person who is child-free by choice, I have always been annoyed by the condescending and sometimes downright ignorant remarks I get from people. If I had a dollar for every time I was told that I would change my mind, I'd be rich.However, Burkett's tone often descends to a similarly snide level. Day-to-day life is more complicated and difficult for people with kids; this is evident and to deny it is naive and whiny."
3,SHE MISSES THE POINT,"The issue is NOT breeder vs. childless----both have equally valid claims to being oppressed and needing a break. The real issue is the way in which the runaway economy (call it the Borg Economy) of post-Cold War global capitalism is turning us into souless automations, worker bees slaving away for the capitalist class. Burkett earns three stars for raising an important issue the family values uber alles crowd refuses to address---the rights of the childless---but is docked two for falling into the divide and conquer trap the American ruling class sets for the masses."
5,Elinor For President!,"This is the best nonfiction I have ever read. Although I do not live in the United States, I have seen the same workplace inequality she documents. Her book will make you angry, but there are funny parts too, like when she talks about a childless woman who pretended to have kids so she could get good schedules at work and got away with it! I'm going to anonymously mail a copy of the book the owner of my company."
5,School of Fish and Josh Clayton Felt,"I'm 46 years old and headphone listening has brought me deeply into the music of School of Fish and Josh Clayton Felt. If you're a fan of George Harrison's finely crafted acoustic pop, you'll love this music."
5,Love this rice cooker!,I have the Panasonic SR-MM10NS rice cooker and I absolutely love it! It makes cooking rice so easy and the brown rice comes out perfect! I have also made a variety of other rices and they have turned out great as well. The model I have comes apart and I can clean the inside top and other parts very easily.I have also used the steamer which is great. The luxury of this cooker is that you set it up and in an hour to two hours your rice is finished. Great to set up right before dinner!
4,very nice cooker,this rice cooker does the job I bought it for- cooking rice and keeping it warm. If I were to improve the cooker I would do two things:a) include a recipe for brown riceb) have the top be removeable for easy cleaning.
4,The best of Olivencia's post-Inca career.,"This album features some of Olivencia's best songs from his ensuing Inca career with TH Rodven. It features Hector Tricoche, although it revolves more heavily on Frankie Ruiz' tracks such as ""Cosas Nativas,"" ""Lo Dudo"" and ""Como lo Hacen."" Tricoche's tracks such as ""No Tires la Primera Piedra"" and ""El del Tabacon"" are just as good. My one concern is the sound quality; most of the tracks are recorded way too loud and some of the tracks that had some audio problems in their original released album where not fixed the second time around. This would have been a great chance to redeem themselves and correct their earlier mistakes at Universal Music, which prevents me from giving this a 5 star rating. Top notch songs nonetheless."
5,A great resource for knitters,"I'd had this book checked out from the library and renewed several times because I was using it. Now, I have my own copy and I am using it,too. This is the definition of a worthwhile book. The size is convenient. Contentwise, there are pictures of each pattern and the directions are clear. Knowing the number of stitches over which the pattern is knit, you can originate your own project, maybe just a flat square, or a scarf, or a sweater or use them for whatever project you might want to do. Each explanation is clear and concise. Excellent glossary of terms in English, equivalent glossary of terms in other languages for anyone who has ever knitted in a different language."
1,EA Technical Support has Dropped BIGTIME!,I can not get any help accept automatic E-mails. There are real problems at EA. I hope you don't have problems or you might get stuck with a worthless game like me.
4,4.5 Stars - Highly Recommended,"This book covers many themes, such as the relationship between civilization and nature, which ties into a conflict between wildness and cultivation. The author presents various important and intriguing topics, but overall I found his investigation into language the most beautiful and interesting element. We discussed this book in my Great Books Discussion Group and there were different interpretations. What I found to be central was the idea that all languages are tied together and share a similar core, but beyond the different languages, there is a universal language. This universal language is not really a language as we know it. To define it would be difficult, but it is something like a silent language, the language of nature, or a symbolic language. Ovid's growth, which occurs once he leaves civilization, is completely tied to his realization of this primal language. I found the novel disturbing at times, but ultimately a very poetic and spiritual creation."
2,Where's Ovid?,"I have to disagree with the complimentary reviews here. Malouf's poetic dreamscape has little or nothing to do with the poet Ovid. You get so lost in Malouf's vague stream-of-consciousness imagery you lose all track of who's telling the story, or why. I started to wonder about a third of the way through why the writer built this 'novel' around any particular historical character. Never read Malouf before -- not likely to read him again."
4,I'm not sure what to make of this novel.,"This is indeed a finely crafted and lyrical work of meta-fiction, and I have to say it made for a nice change of pace after UNDERWORLD - Don DeLillo's complex post-modern epic - but in the end I was left to wonder what it was really about. Where was the characterization of Ovid? The protagoist could have been anybody. It helped to pass a bleak Canadian winter's afternoon, but in the end the characters and plot are very forgetable."
4,"""Brilliant short novel about civilization""","A brilliant short novel about civilization and it's relative disadvantages. It is ostensibly about the poet Ovid's exile from Rome in the fist century A.D. and his developing relationship weather feral child on the outskirts of the empire: Civilization vs. Nature. The importance of language in the novel is questioned, makes a good departure for a book group that will discuss the impact of words. We used Malouf's flowing novel to launch our book club, and the discussion touched on various topics such as Ovid, religion, Roman history."
1,Very poor out put,"The first thing you see when you open the package is : PLEASE DO NOT RETURN TO STORE; they then give you information of where you can get help. The unit does not cool as it claims. We have one that does not cool. It sits here, waiting for a ""reply"" on how to return the unit to the manufacturer. We are out $$$. Don't waste your money on this item."
2,"Good, but many flaws","This book has everything I love in a cookbook: tried-and-true recipes with descriptions of why they're so special. That's the good news. The bad news is that many recipes are just doctored up cake mixes/canned fillings (which is not what anyone I know would give a gift), and a disproportionate number contain Cool Whip and/or require refrigeration, and will only last for a day or so -- but the author gives no hint about how long to keep things. Refrigerated items (such as dips) are bad enough in a cookbook intended for gift-giving, but they are mixed in with the other recipes -- so, if you're trying to find something to mail or travel with, you'll have to go through the entire book, looking at the bottom of each recipe. What a pain! Also, it has one of the worst indexes I've ever seen - so, if you find something you want to try, affix a post-it note."
4,Good Product,This is product is decent and works ok. I am used to using liquid flus though not brush on and I think that has tainted my view of this product.However it works well and is applied easily if not cleanly.
5,Founding stone for new integrated medicine,"I am a serious mitochondrial researcher, but lacked historical account of it. This book lead us to Aristoteles and Ancient Chinese ""ki"" in tour de force. As we enter new millenium, we need to integrate western medicine and eastern medicine, because separation of ""thinking"" or philosophy of medicine really kills people. Bioenergy or ""chi, ki or whatever"" is same thing, as Dr. Brown show us. If one accept this concept, we could make this integrated medicine. I recommend everyone in medicine or health science in large, should read this book and ponder on the implications it bring.Hong Kyu Lee, M.D. professor, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine"
4,Points toward super-athletes of new century,"The most interesting piece of information was a description of how the mitochondria in other animals produce more energy than human mitochondria. Using the example of a leopard, our cells only produce 10% as much energy. The possibility for the future is transplanting mitochondria from other animals so our athletes can produce much more energy, a truly explosive amount of energy. So far, this is as theoretical as a Crichton novel on quantum time-travel, but it is a fascinating concept."
4,Probably appeals to most Monty fans!,"I somehow hope you're not like me, because I usually buy every book written by any of the Monty Pythons. DON'T DO LIKE I DO! It's expensive!Sure, this book is a wonderful read, even if you already know most Monty dialogue by heart. This book will look nice next to your other Monty Python litterature, but know this. This book will most likely not last long, before you put it on the shelf and start watching the episodes again. Buy this book only if you're an insane Monty fan, in which case you probably haven't read any of these reviews anyway."
5,"Sorry squire, I've gobbed on your carpet","I suggest you sit down with some Conquistador Instant Leprosy and read both volumes of this, if you enjoy that sort of thing."
4,"""Still no sign of land...""","""That's rather a personal question, sir."" ""You stupid git! I meant how long have we been in the lifeboat. You've spoiled the atmosphere now!"" ""I'm sorry."" This book is definite must reading for all serious python fans. They say that laughter is the best medicine. This book is a great stress reliever for those who have had a bad day, unless you are a person who at the end of a sentence tends to come up with the wrong fuse box. I have only read volume 2, but I'm sure volume 1 is just as good. It's best if read while playing the organ in your birthday suit. I could say more, but I'm afraid this review is getting a bit too silly."
3,What the books make one realize,"That Monty Python is actually very limited a franchise. These few Python book which script the entire series in it's four year run (as there was only a few eps each year) really leave one saying ""Is that all the fuss is about?"" Sure there were Python movies (but about half of these films were simply rehashes of the series). I never understood when Python became so big. In the late 70's they were just something I watched on a UHF station latenight. Benny Hill was really funnier than Python (even the UHF station advertised Hill that way) but he didn't become as much of a franchise. Python shouldn't of either. Really there isn't that much to it!"
3,"Interesting, If Interested In Magic","Fortunately I am as this is no laymen's book. I quite enjoyed it and found it full of the fragmented tidbits of information I am so fond of. A little technical at times - I was far more interested in some of the stories then in precise line drawings or sketches, though Steinmeyer is skilled at taking complex principles and breaking them down into simple line drawings. I wish it had been a bit more chatty but am glad i read it."
4,Author loves his subject,This is a very enjoyable book on the history of magic and how the great illusions were achieved. The author has an obvious love for his subject and has put a great deal of thought into recostructing the secrets of lost illusions e.g. The disappearing donkey.
5,"Hiding the Elephant, Buyers Comment","I am a student of magic and a dinner-table amateur magician. I found this book very informative on some of the better well-kept secrets the best magicians keep close to thier vest.I highly recommend the book as a ""good read"" for anyone who is interested in magic, or who has only a passing interest in this topic. You will be richly rewarded.Tim Healy"
4,Wonderful history primary focused on the appearing and disappearing act,"I enjoyed the pace of this book. It was fun to learn how a few illusions developed and performed. It was any easy read broken into chapters which made recreational reading enjoyable. A little science was introduced with regards to mirrors and angles. Overall, a very nice read. The illustrations and photos were also nice but not plentiful."
2,Not what it promisses to be,"Steinberg is a widely recognized writer in the field of magis, and being interested in the field, I bought the book as the result of another Amazon review I read. It was a real dissapointment, failing to clearly explain what he promisses, and to get to the point where you discover that, you'll have to trudge through many pages of uninteresting details."
1,An Unmagical Book,"As an amateur magician as was really excited to read this book. It had all my favorite elements: vaudville, Harry Houdini, and colorful characters. However, the writing is sooo damn dry, I often had to put the book down. I would simply just get bored. The author meanders all over the place. Where is the excitement? Where is the sizzle? WHere is the showmanship? This is magic for crying out loud, it is supposed to be exciting."
5,Not your average magic book,"If you're looking for a book to teach you magic tricks, this is not the book for you. Granted, it describes how some grand illusions work (mostly those that aren't in use any longer), but the book is more about the history of magic. But don't let that turn you off. It's not the dry, boring history you'd find in a textbook. There are anecdotes, personal recollections, and much more. It's a very easy read, and it's absolutely fascinating."
3,Jersey Shore Season,Very pleased at how fast I received the order and every is also working great as well too! :) :)
3,Still censored... ?,"I love Jersey shore. Don't get me wrong. But the whole reason I bought this collection of ""uncensored"" dvds was so that I could enjoy the episodes minus the ""BLEEEEEEP""s every 2 minutes. Unfortunately, this ""uncensored"" version still has about 50% of the BLEEEEEPs. Just a heads up."
1,this show makes america look bad,this tv show is pure trash from the very begining to the very end i hate this show alot its not even a show its one of the dumbest tv shows ever produced for mtv i use to like mtv when i was younger but mtv has since changed and gone downhill you want a real tv show look at the show jag or cheers heck even the simpsons and family guy and south park put this lame mtv show to shame and buy something else instead this show stinks buy a book or a cd instead of this trashy show
4,Learned about t shirt time!,I liked it... Good purchase. It's Jersey Shore so if you need to catch up on season two and t shirt time... It's worth it.
5,Pure Entertainment,"Anyone is certifiably crazy if they don't like this show. It not only offers great laughs but a link to today's society, seeing as how this is one of the most popular/well-known shows on the planet. Such a good show!"
1,"Parade of The Brain-Dead, Part II","It's a sad reflection of today's society that trash like this is successful.There's nothing but obscenties thrown around by barely-literate apes and trailer trash girls.These guys and gals (if you want to call them that) were simply in the right place at the right time and found stardom via this putrid vehicle.The girls (and most of the guys, save for Vinnie and Pauly D) don't even have good looking faces! Just surgically and chemically enhanced bodies.I feel bad for the next generation, being weaned on this nonsense."
1,Need content that isn't showing our youth to act like fools.,"I'm sorry, but I have watched this with a friend before and she is hooked. I have no clue why. These young adults barely hold a job, get drunk every night and change partner like I change clothes. This is ridiculous and shows our youth a wrong side of America instead of being responsible lets pay them millions to act like fools. Great idea....now throw in pregnancy before marriage and in their teens, oh wait there is a show for that too called Teen Moms. What is our society coming to when we show our children that it is okay to do this by making TV shows about it."
1,this tv show is a waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is the worst tv show on tv i no longer liked mtv when they started putting reality shows in their line up but i no longer watch mtv due to it showing unintelligent reality shows like this borefest known as the jersey shore i do like beavis and butthead and other stuff but i hate reality shows they long stupid and boring and unintelligent buy something else better instead of this dvd that truly is a waste of time and money
5,Awesome.,"They ""uncensored"" alot of it I don't why people act like it's not uncensored... At all. Which it is because other-wise it wouldn't say ""uncensored"" for no reason. And they have to censor some of the words because they can be really dirty and crude. And if that was me I'd censor some of it too. But one question, how come when I bought this DVD it didn't have the ""Cast Interviews"". Hmm.....? And says in special features ""Cast Interviews"". Well I don't care as long as I have uncensored ""Season Two"" episodes. Thatz all I care about."
2,The Little Mangent that wishes it could,"While this magnet is easy to install, we find that it does not catch our mostly-stainless steel silverware (which our more powerful fridge magnets can indeed hold). This item has saved a few smaller items from the jaws of the disposal. The included beer cap to demonstrate the magnetic ability was a humorous touch. I bought this as a splurge when I bought the garbage disposal and have found this item just okay."
4,Not the one I wanted,"I settled on the one I got because they were out of this one. The one I got is okay, but I would have preferred this one."
1,The Simpson Trial Tour Guide,"Having read many of the accounts of the Simpson trial from the principals themselves, I looked forward to Dunne's slant on the saga. Perhaps, an experienced writer would place the trial and repercussions in some worthwhile perspective. Wrong. What Dunne delivers is a dizzying rampage through every possible gathering of any conceivable combination of ""celebrities"". Although the book is presented in a supposed fictional style, I cannot fathom what the distinction is meant to convey. While the book does include many interesting tidbits about the characters in and around the trial, it is weighted down by an encyclopedic accounting of the author's social encounters. Not my Own, reachs no insights into the ramifications of the Simpson affair larger than the authors resolute outrage. A real disappointment."
1,PUH-LEEZE!,"I have thoroghly enjoyed this author's previous books, especially the brilliant A SEASON IN PURGATORY from which an also excellent film version was made. Because I so admired Dominick Dunne's writing skills and had found his other books so compelling (I've read some of them more than once) I was eager to read ANOTHER CITY, NOT MY OWN and gladly paid for a hardbound copy as soon as they were available. That said, it is difficult to find adequate words to sum up my disappointment in this book. Inane, pretentious, self-promoting, fatuous and poorly written are some adjectives that come to mind. It is difficult to believe that the same author who produced AN INCONVENIENT WOMAN, THE TWO MRS. GRENVILLES, and A SEASON IN PURGATORY has turned out this poor, lazily-written piece of drivel. What *was* this author (not to mention the publisher)thinking about? Was an editor involved at all? Save your money: this book isn't even worth its price in paperback. Shame on you, Mr. Dunne!"
4,A unique look at the OJ debacle.,"After reading the reviews I found myself laughing. Many didn't like the book because of all the ""namedropping"". And yet, that's exactly what the book's about, and what makes it so enjoyable. First time I've read Dunne. Found myself glued to all the dinner parties to hear about OJ as well. I did not follow the trial and thought that OJ would probably get a hung jury, until the jury came back wuith such a short deliberation. The book captured it all. And now I realize it caught a lot of my feelings. That OJ is THE KILLER and OJ never really was put on trial."
4,A gossipy page-turner! A fun read.,"Although masked as ""a novel in the form of a memoir"", even if you are mildly informed about the O.J. trial and its players, it is easy to separate fact from fiction in ANOTHER CITY. If you're looking for an objective chronicle of the trial this is not a reliable source. Instead, view this as a glimpse of the glitterati,-- their opinions, their parties, their lifestyles (although namedropping and self-promoting at times). Sophisticated, discerning readers will view this as a page-turner that entertains so long as Dunne's strong assertions of O.J.'s guilt don't interfere with your having some fun."
5,"Good beginning and middle, goofy in the last few pages...","I was an OJ trial junkie all the way from the white Bronco chase through the civil verdict. Dominick Dunne seems to capture the essence of the trial from the point of view of the 'rich and famous'...people who knew OJ and whose circles of friends overlapped with him. I literally could not put the book down...one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time. The book seems to be Dunne's fictionalized autobiography. I'm not sure if all the events in the book really did occur, but it was written as a novel, so I just accepted them as part of the story. The only fly in the ointment of the entire book is the introduction of Andrew Cunanan, and how he figures into the end of the book. Not to give anything away, but it seems as though Cunanan was a last minute add-in that allowed Dunne to give the book the kind of ending he wanted to. Other than that, it was great!"
2,Name dropping as an art form,"This book should be titled ""The OJ Dinners"". Few people had access to as much information about the prinicple characters in the Simpson trial as Dominick Dunne. He has squandered an opportunity to write an important book, and settled for a name dropping, gossip-laden barely-fictionalized account of the proceedings. Anyone looking for a factual review of the trial should look elsewhere.What the book does, however, is give the reader an exceptional account of the circus atmosphere surrounding the trial and the bizarre nature of the fame which came to the participants.What is the difference between Vanity Fair and the National Enquirer? Celebrities will talk with a Vanity Fair reporter. After that, the distinctions become somewhat blurred."
2,"Another book on this case,was it worth the wait?","Having enjoyed Dominick Dunne's thinly disguised fictions as sheer entertainment in the past, I found this book very disappointing. Please tell me something that was not already on Entertainment Tonight years ago! Take out the celebrity names dropped in this book and it would read like a censored letter. As it is, it reads like a Hard Copy interview before editing; rambling, requiring little cerebral activity and repetitious. THE MOST UNFORGIVABLE LITERARY SIN IS PRESENT IN THIS TEDIOUS BOOK, ENNUI.Yawn."
3,Disappointing ending,"An avid follower of the Simpson trial and regular monthly reader of Mr. Dunne's contributions to Vanity Fair, I eagerly looked forward to delving into this book, a Christmas gift from a loved one who knew I was eager to read it. Though I enjoyed the many observations offered by ""Gus"" heretofore not included in prior trial reports by author Dunne, I felt cheated and was thoroughly disappointed with the story's ending. I expected better from Dunne, particularly given the interesting story he wove throughout the earlier portions of the book. Perhaps he ran out of steam when it came to penning the conclusion; it's unfortunate, because up until that point, I would have highly recommended the book to friends and colleagues. Given the ending, however, I would say to others not to waste your time only to experience such isappointment."
1,don't rush to read this one,"i've liked other stuff by dunne, but found this very pretentious . . . a lot of name dropping . . . not much substance."
1,What could have been...,"Dominick Dunne is angry. He wants to tell the world why this trial was a farce. Or so you would think based on what his alter ego discusses in this tale of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Instead we get this farcical collection of name dropping, recycled material (This would have been better if it just collected Dunne's magazine pieces), and the conceit of calling this a work of fiction, with the jaw dropping stupidity of an ending that ranks high on the list of ridiculous plot turns in the history of fiction. What a waste of time."
1,MERELY HOLLYWOOD GOSSIP,"I started reading this book as I wanted to know about the O.J.Simpson trial. What do I get? Some Hollywood [stuff] about the author's schedule of dinner parties, at fashionable houses and restaurants and gossip; not facts about the trial. Am I supposed to be impressed by all the name droppings, self promotion and his invitations to posh houses? I'm not. Neither am I interested in Hollywood gossip. The guy is so [sad] trying to be with the ""in crowd"" that I felt quite sorry for him. I cannot believe how shallow the book is. ...This I believe, is a best seller, only because some Hollywood women, who have nothing better to do than give parties, go shopping and laze around, bought the book as they or someone known to them were in it. This is the first and the last time I read Dominic Dunne."
5,Riveting!,"There isn't much more to say. This book was my introduction to the fabulous work of Dominick Dunne, father of a murder victim, who is steadfast and passionate in his pursuit of justice--for all, not just the rich and the celebrated.If you had even a fleeting interest in the ""debacle of the century"", which involved a now-infamous football figure, bloody gloves and a a three-ring circus that masquaraded as a trial, read it. And everything and anything else by Dominick Dunne!"
2,This novel was a major disappointment.,"Reading books about the Simpson case is a lot like watching the trial--no matter how bad things get, it's hard to quit looking. Dunne's inexplicable decision to turn his fine reporting of this case into a novel, instead of a straightforward memoir of his year covering the trial, seems a fatal flaw. The reader is left constantly wondering, and therefore distracted by, the issue of whether the events in any scene actually took place, or are fiction. Dunne was a powerful voice for morality in a case that certainly needed one. Disappointingly, a compilation of his essays from Vanity Fair, with some added commentary, would have created a much better final product. I would urge interested readers to turn to Jeffrey Toobin's The Run of His Life, or Mark Fuhrman's A Murder in Brentwood, which is my personal favorite."
5,"Wonderful, fun read.","Dominick Dunne has done it again! The next best thing to actually being there, ""Another City..."" sweeps you up and makes you a part of the action. Told in his inimitable style, Dunne names names and leaves you wondering where the real story ends and the fiction begins.This book is must reading for those who seek the guilty pleasure of a good, dishy read. You will NOT be disappointed!"
5,A real pleasure ride,"I so thoroughly enjoyed the book, that I then read an Inconvient Woman. If you don't mind the name dropping, it's a real glimpse into Dunne's own crisis'. An easy, very enjoyable read. Most fascinating blend of novel and memoir. The book comes really alive if you are at all familiar with the LA area."
2,What a disappointment !,"Having been fascinated by Mr. Dunnes television comentaries on the Simpson case, I looked forward to this book. What a disappointment! Mr.Dunne, with his acess to the trial participants,plus his personal experiance as a crime victim could have written THE book on the Simpson Murders.Instead,we got a book which was as shallow as Gus Bailey's Hollywood cronies. I suspect that Dominic Dunne was so disgusted , rightly so, in the outcome of the trial that his heart wasn't in this book.Perhaps because he had publicly said during the trial that he was going to write this book he felt obligated to do so.I for one,wish he hadn't. Kevin J. Morgan"
4,Just when you think you had enough of O.J....,"I was surprised that I liked Another City, Not my Own as much as I did. I was expecting to be gossipy, but I was touched by Gus Bailey's comaprison of his daughter being murdered(Based on Dunne's daughter actress Dominique Dunne's murder fifteen years ago) If nothing else, the family scenes are great, and there is new stuff about O.J. Judge Ito, and the rest of the O.J. circus that I didn't even know. A good Saturday night read, and it reminds you: There are four victims in this media frenzy; Nicole Brown, Ron Goldman, and Syndney and Justin Simpson, who will never know for sure if their father killed their mother."
1,"Should be titled ""Namedropping 101""","A very sad effort in my opinion! Dunne has spent too much time with O.J.'s trial, but this is a big waste of time. I've read all his books, but perhaps this one is the last!"
2,Not bad for a beach book.,Well I didn't fall asleep reading it but I didn't try to stay awake either. I would take this to the poolside in the summer. Not a great book.
4,We all need to have online manners,"I am currently enjoying this book and am almost finish. I recommend it as an entertaining read. UNFORTUNATELY, DLFLYERS ruined the ending. As I was reading the reviews on this website, he blurted out the end for all to read. Thanks for nothing.!!!!! It's common sense. People come to this site for opinions on the book, not the outcome!!"
4,Very gossipy and entertaining,"Despite the constant name dropping (Princess Diana, Margaret Thatcher, Nancy Reagan, et al), this book was an entertaining read. It doesn't provide a great insight into the trial (it's not meant to) but still, highly entertaining."
4,"C'mon, give Dom a break","I think some of the other reviewers are being awfully hard on Dominick Dunne and this novel. Is it really a surprise that a book by Dunne would contain name-dropping? I found this to be a fascinating book which I couldn't put down. It's refreshing to find someone who's unafraid to express his candid opinions about the Simpson case without couching them in legalese or PC rhetoric.As for the unusual ending, it didn't bother me. If Dunne wanted to make sure the Gus Bailey character would never cover another murder trial, I can't think of a more original way."
2,Expected a great read ..... was very disappointed.,"I enjoyed ""A Season in Purgatory"" so much that I couldn't wait to read this book. I was very disappointed. I expected interesting information regarding the Simpson trial and instead was fed a steady diet of ""hollywood parties"" and name-dropping. It seems the Simpson trial was put on the ""back burner"" while things I didn't care about (like constant name-dropping) were pursued. Very disappointing........"
2,A wearying tale,"Although I really like Dunne's style (the novel in the form of a memoir), I soon became weary of all the name dropping and insistent repition of ""This will make a great scene in my novel."" It was almost as if Dunne were too clever for his own good. Even though it was difficult to wade through the names and descriptions of Dunne's friends (and enemies), the book itself was engaging and the commentary on the Simpson trial will be nothing new for readers of Dunne's Vanity Fair articles. However, I must state that I absolutely hated the not so surprising ""surprise"" ending. The addition of Andrew Cunanan in this book was one (in)famous name too many!"
2,Disappointed!,"Well I'm gratified to see that others were disappointed in Dunne's latest effort. Sometimes I think I expect too much ... especially since I had such fun (years ago, I admit) with The Two Mrs. Grenvilles. I generally choose my film by director, just as I am used to selecting books by authors. This just doesn't work all the time, does it?"
3,An o.k. read...creepy ending,"I read this book while on vacation and found it rather dull. I agree with many of the other reviewers, there was too much name dropping. I thought the suprise ending was just too creepy. At the end of the book I felt like Gus should weigh 300 pounds for all the food he ate and have sore elbows from all the celebrity elbow rubbing. An o.k. read."
1,An outline for another book.,"I love Dominck Dunne's writing. I read him all the time in Vanity Fair and have read a few of his novels, so when I heard that he had written about the OJ trial I rushed to read it. However, this book unlike his other novels do not tell the story of the crime and the trial, it is a name dropping session. Dunne reports all the parties his fictional counter part Gus Bailey is invited to and who he sits next to.Worse still is the fact that this book is an outline of the book he was going to write about the Mendez trial. A several points during the story he writes about the chapter Gus has just written for his book about the Mendez's brothers. I wish he had written the book about the Mendez it probably would have been a better book."
2,Name dropping to the extremes...,"I am a huge fan of Dominick Dunne's previous novels, but this was just too much. I couldn't get over the constant parties, name dropping, and sheer ridiculousness of this book. It's not nearly as exciting as some of his other books, and is downright corny in a lot of situations. Glad I only paid $2 for it at a used book sale. The real problem that I had, though, was that he mentions Lefty Flynn, who I thought Gus Bailey killed and went to prison for murdering in People Like Us. What's up with that? Too many characters to keep track of?"
1,The Art of TELLING,"I can't remember another book, by an established author, that ignored the rule in writing-- show don't tell-- with such commitment. I have seen this narrow, flat writing in beginning fiction classes, but that is to be expected. Dunne gives us no scene set up or character development. He relies on his readers to fill in all the details, because we probably know the story. I found it tiresome to be told who the people were and what locations had been named in other books. Who cares? What's the story he's writing here? I've enjoyed Dunne's writing in the past and was amazed with the pages of dialogue accompanied by no details or description. I felt, by the end, that I was reading a trial transcript. What a let down. I really had been looking forward to his insight and twist on this well document moment in our history."
1,Rotten apple!,"I just finished reading this book and had to rush to the internet to find out if I was the only one who is absolutely stunned at the absurdity of this novel. Disbelief is my primary reaction. I honestly can't believe that such a fine author could take such an urgent subject and turn it into such an almost unreadable jumble of meandering fact and fiction. It was not engrossing enough for me to muster the energy to glean a possible hidden message. If there was one, it was very well hidden under tons of society minutae. If you haven't read any of his other books, please don't be put off by this one. It is the rotten apple in an otherwise juicy barrel."
1,What A Load of Crap by a Mere Lunatic Sociopath!,"This book is a joke and so is the pathetic nitwit who wrote it! In a nutshell, what he describes in this book is tantamount to stalking, fraud, and identity theft. It gives me the creeps to think that this convicted criminal now has the mitigating gall to believe that he is a reformed authority on the subjects of breaching trust, security, and invading privacy. Moreover, the writing style indicates clearly that this buffoon has had no formal education much less penitentiary rehabilitation. Don't waste your time or your train of good thoughts on this adolescent nonsense!"
1,Pathetic,"This book is pathetic- this man is pathetic. The book attempts to glorify identity theft in a boring, disastrous tale of encounters with like minded criminals. Instead of being interesting, it's just plain STUPID!"
4,Comes complete with visiting police officers,"Let's see....I like my Lasershield home security system, but for some reason, it malfunctions once in a great while, as it spontaneously goes off when I'm just minding my own business at home. I ""deactivate"" my already deactivated alarm, and just 4 hours later, I get a knock on my door from the cavalry. Well........I guess it works properly in THAT aspect!!!! The cop told me that he gets a lot of alarms going off when there are drastic changes in the weather. Changes in the weather? Huh? Whatever. On the more serious side, it's a decent security system for the price. You can purchase extra monitors for every room of the house. The units are fairly small, so they don't take up too much space. Normally I don't buy anything that's endorsed by Rush Limbaugh, but this security system got my attention back in 2007, and I have no regrets."
3,Slow lasershield,"I own a 1200 sq ft condo and have small individual alarm device on front & patio door before I bought my lasershield. I wanted something better, cheaper in one unit, to cover the hole condo, but after setting it up in minutes. I was disappointed with the low siren sound, my small door device are much louder than the lasershield. Plus the turning on of box is slow..lasershield talk to you before its activated. Was not really for that, slow turn on and low alarm sound. Oh well, I plan on keeping my lasershield, in conjunction with my other door device it cover all areas of my small condo.Lasershield is on!!!"
2,Question the authenticity of these reviews...,"I was curious about this product and was amazed to see so many ""perfect"" reviews. I seldom see so many great reviews for any product on Amazon, so I decided to see what other reviews these people have posted. I found out that these positive posters have not reviewed ANY other products (except one person who reviewed a book)... Typically, Amazon buyers review more than one products, plus the reviews will find something negative to say about a product, even if the overall review is very positive. But these reviews sound like they were written to sell the alarm, rather than to honestly evaluate the product! My educated guess is that these are not authentic reviews at all, but instead were posted by someone who profits from the sale of this device. Take a look at the reviews (written before mine) to judge for yourself."
1,Horrible! Nothing more than a huge waste of time!,"We had high hopes for this system. Then it arrived. I never worked right so we tried more than a dozen times to work with them to get it to work. Even the remotes wouldn't work. We got a set of remotes that would kill the battery in less than a day. They sent ""new"" ones. Same thing. Then another set. Same thing. The hype is really great but the system really sucks! Don't waste your time or your money. Now we have a high tech looking paper weight."
3,It's okay.,"I have owned this system for about 2 to 3 years. Before that I owned a similar Radio Shack alarm. They were similar in price, quality and performance. I have had to replace 2 of the remote MDU units at my own expense because they developed intermittent problems. Other than that, it's okay."
2,No programming required?,"In the box it says... ""No programming required"" it should state ""No programming possible"" as it is not possible to program it to call you on your cell or any phone at all. Not much to do without the service. Even the sound from the alarm itself is very mild, a little louder than my alarm clock, but nowhere scary. I have had other low end systems with better functionality and more powerful alarm sound. This system has a lot of potential, but not well developed for my needs... Maybe it would work fine with the subscription. I think this should be on the description, because I had no idea it was useless without the activation."
4,Love this book!,This book offers quite a number of garden plans for just about any zone. It has detailed color plans and planting diagrams. It has been a valuable resource to me in planning my yard.
4,2 Wires,These wires installed in about 30 seconds and so far have not missed a beat. Its nice for a change to get something that does what it says and lives up to the practical use its supposed to.
1,Not the place to start a swing collection...,"Dodgy recording quality, spend a little more and get Anthology of Big Band Swing, a 2 cd set."
3,Fine if you're not too picky,"If you're looking for the original recordings in pristine original quality, you will not get it here. The music here is good, but it seems to be drawn from later re-recordings. Some of the material that is drawn from original 78s can have some reverb added, although that's not always the case. If you're a budget label, you have to get what you can get. Some of the recordings are muddy-sounding, probably somebody's atempt at trying to reduce tape hiss. They should have kept the hiss. *smile* I'm not an expert on big band music, but it seems musically speaking the performances are quite decent. I think it would be good for somebody who's curious to collect some of the big band sounds and who doesn't care about whether they're the originals or not. Despite sound qulaity flaws mentioned above, it's a keeper. I'm kind of a budget-label collector, so such flaws kind of add to the allure of the set in a quirky kind of way."
4,A wealth of knowledge for those involved in the duet genre,"Hundreds of composers and what seems to be over a thousand works, most of them obscure. It is a wonderful little handbook which, whenever possible, states also the duration of pieces, publisher, style, difficulty, and any other information you may need to locate the score. There are some major works missing from it, for example George Crumb's Celestial Mechanics, Yvar Mikhashof's arrangement of Conlon Nancarrow's Sonatina, Ravel's Rhapsodie Espagnole or Lucien Garban's arrangement of his La Valse, Stravinsky's Petroushka or The Rite of Spring (both composed first for this medium and later orchestrated by the composer), John Corigliano's Gazebo Dances. And these are the ones I am aware of, who knows how many others have been overlooked. Nevertheless you have 312 solid pages of works for one piano four hands (not two pianos!) from A-Z. A must for any duo pianist out there."
4,OverviewQuatreMainsPianoMusic4Hands1Piano,"If you are looking for quatre mains repertoire, this is the book to buy. Ordered by composer it gives short but the right information."
3,"Unbelievable story, but believable chemistry","Well the story of the Peruvian military promoting and maintaining a brothel to keep the morale of its troops up is more male fantasy than reality, but the sexual chemistry between Pantaleon and the sexy ""visitadora"" is believable. Not Oscar material, but the movie is entertaining."
1,It comes with only 1 movie!,I bought it for the Fito Paez movie and was thinking good deal... get 2 movies... but it only comes with 1 movie!!... Vida privadas... I play the DVD in my player... and in my computer.... I look on every single choice in the menu... I double check the dvd case... and NOTHING... only 1 movie... no Pantaleon y las visitadoras.... what a lie!
4,It's just a Smoke Alarm,"This is a smaller sized smoke alarm. After fooling around, and even reading the manual, I got it to work."
3,Bad description on package,"The product package says ""Install in every room"" and recommends placing a smoke alarm on every level of your home. What it does not point out is the NFPA recommends interconnecting all of your smoke alarms so that an alarm on one level will sound the alarm at all smoke alarm stations in the home. These are battery-only alarms that do not connect to each other. If there is a fire on one level of your home, you might not be able to hear the alarm on another level until it is too late. You should also not install them in a kitchen due to nuisance alarms from cooking.These alarms might be better suited to be used in a smaller, single story home where all the bedrooms are near the same area of the home.They can still be a useful product, but I wish the package would be more helpful to someone not well versed on fire alarm code requirements."
3,Wish it used AA batteries,"good, but wish it used the less expensive and readily available AA batteries. 9 volt batteries are becoming passe and expensive."
4,compact,"I bought this for our trailer, and it is nice and compact, which is what one needs in limited space. As with all smoke dectectors in a trailer, it goes off when your toast get a little burnt or bacon fries. You just have to live with that fact."
4,Good economical,Gets the job done. Simple to install and clean looking. Came at a good price and is sensitive upon testing.
3,There's really only one way to truly test a smoke alarm,"It was easy to install. The battery that came with it has an adequate charge. It tests properly. But there's really only one way to know if a smoke alarm will work in the single situation for which one buys it. To that end, I can't say for sure how well it really works. So far, so good."
4,Kidde i9040 Fire Sentry smoke alarm,This is a very small and cute alarm. They are also very inexpensive and I have seen them for less than 5$ each. The newest ones now have the hush feature that is activated by pushing the test button(some boxes still have the older image of the alarm without the hush feature). They just use the standard 9 volt battery. They only have an ionization sensor so it may be a good idea to get some photoelectric alarms also. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because they seem to be built a little cheaply. I had one where the buzzer became detached from the lid and when the alarm was tested the sound was a bit muffled. Overall I think this is a very good alarm for the price.
4,Smal and easy to install.,"Took little time to install. Lack of a battery cover, or even a battery, is understandable, given the low price. Have had no fires to test it as yet, but it does meet my insurance companies requirement."
3,No silence button,"Despite what the instruction manual says, this unit's test button does not double as a silence button. If you burned the toast and you'd like to stop the blaring fire alarm, your only option is to take it down and pop out the batteries. Don't use this smoke detector in the kitchen."
5,Surprisingly compact...good deal,"I received the i9040 today and I'm very happy with it. It was very easy to install and I'm especially amazed at how much smaller it is than the typical smoke detector. Yet, it put the big sound piercing sound, and from what I can tell -- it works great. Good technology at a great price."
5,good product,Used this to replace a non-working smoke alarm in a travel trailer. It mounted easily and works fine. It is slightly smaller than the old unit.
4,"Easy, easy installation!!","These detectors perfectly serve their purpose, were extremely easy to install and the price could not be beat!! Bought 7 and very pleased"
1,Get a First Alert alarm instead--,"The fire alarm instructions don't tell you that you need a drill, screwdriver, hammer. Nor do they explain the little plastic screw anchors that come with the unit. Get a ""First Alert"" alarm instead--they are better made. An alarm with shoddy instructions was probably built sloppily."
4,"So far, it's good...it's loud!","Just received this the other day, so haven't had the chance to see how quickly it reacts when smoke is near it. Upon opening the package, it was extremely easy to set up & having the battery included is always a plus. It's small and simple! The testing button proved the alarm to be quite loud, it's 2x the strength of my current alarms. I originally just bought one to install into my guest house. I will be buying more of these to replace the ones in my own house!"
5,Great price and amazingly small,"These units are small... like crazy small. In fact, the packaging for these units is small. The detectors do come with a batter and a mounting kit. Cheap enough to put in all the bedrooms in your house. Highly suggested."
4,Small and easy to install,"These are very small, hardly notice them in the ceiling. They are loud when needed (have only tested them). They were a snap to install. I installed 4 under 30 minutes. You can't beat the price for safety and peace of mind. I would give them 5 stars if they had interconnecting capability. But they are stand alone units."
5,Smoke Alarm,"Easy installation, I like that it's compact, and has two types of fire detection. One for normal fires, and instant fires."
4,red light blinking...,"I don't know if it's supposed to blink or not, I didn't bother reading the instruction booklet, but every once in a while the blinking red light catches my attention. It probably flashes once a minute... haven't had any fires to see if it works, don't want to find out."
4,Good product,Good price for single function alarm. I installed 2 in the rental house and no false alarm so far. It's smaller package than the standard one.
1,crappy projection,"First the time is way way off. You set it, than the next day, its like 5 hours off. Second, The projection is very very very very low u cant see a dam thing.And the outdoor remote broke when it came. All the clock says it --oF (changing batteries doesnt help) Avoid this product. Also it looks big and high quality in the photo...its not; it comes in a small carboard box about size of ur palm. its small."
2,Maybe I had a Lemon . . .,"Note: I am commenting on a clock which I DID NOT purchase from Amazon.The clock does everything advertised, but its most useful unique feature is the projection of the time, alternating with the outside temperature, on the ceiling or wall.If you sleep on your back, you'll LOVE the idea of waking up in the middle of the night and seeing the time on the ceiling above you.I returned this unit, though, because I had way too much trouble getting the outside sensor to communicate with the main unit-- and I never had it outside of the same room. I followed the manual, which instructs you to put batteries in the sensor FIRST, then in the main unit, but it never displayed the temperature from the sensor.The instructions are not so easy to understand, and if you haven't had one of these projection clocks before, it may take a lot of reading and re-reading."
1,"Horrible, don't buy it.",The clock came in a package that was taped together and all mangled. That was my first clue that I should have sent it back. I set it according to the instructions and put it by a window. A month later it still doesn't have the correct time. And if you want to buy it because it's suppose to project the time on the wall or the ceiling ---- forget it! It's so small that you would have to get up and use a magnifying glass to see it. I wish I hadn't thrown away the box. It would be so back in the mail.
2,La Crosse Projection clock,I received my clocks in good time but can't get the projection to stay on. The directions are vague so I emailed the customer service three times and still have not got a response. I had one of these before and loved it but this new one is not the same.
2,Clock,Clock was not what I expected. Very cheaply manufactured and the display was small. Hard for an older person to see.I actually returned to clock.
3,"falls over easily, missing features of other La Crosse models","I bought this to complement another La Crosse projection alarm clock that I've had for several years. I was going to configure one to project the time all the time, and the other to project the temperature all the time. If only I had realized that this model is stripped down and doesn't have a ""mode"" capability and therefore it can only display an alternating time and temperature. Not the fault of La Crosse, but annoying to me.The reason for the three stars is because this thing is amazingly difficult to setup and it falls over if you barely touch it. Somehow the design is unbalanced. If you use this as an alarm clock, you will hate setting it up, and you will knock it over every morning when you try to turn it off. Our other La Crosse doesn't have either problem."
3,ok alarm clock,"The alarm clock is nice. The features for weather and resetting are good. the alarm is ok. It is not a loud beeping, but it does speed up twice. this is not for heavy sleepers. The projection simply horrible. It has to be completely dark to see it. A little light in the room and you will have trouble seeing the projection."
3,LaCrosse Clock Review,"We bought this clock as a replacement for a several year old similar clock that no longer was reliable. The new LaCrosse did all that it was supposed to, but we found that it was difficult to find a place in the room where it would pick up the time signals. It finally worked well, but not where we wanted it to be. In addition, the time projected on the ceiling was not as bright as the old one, and the printed instructions said that if the image was too dim, to ""adjust the intensity"". We could not find any intensity control, and contacted LaCrosse; a week later they responded by saying that the ""intensity control was pronted in error, and that there is no intensity adjustment"". They need to be more careful with what they advertise. We are using the clock, it has some good features, but it is not the best product that I have seen."
2,not as good as the older model,I think that the older model was far superior. This one has less features and gives you less options to display exactly what you want to see from the immage that is projected
3,Not a reliable Alarm Clock,"I've had this clock for almost a year. I love the projection feature, indoor temp and barometer-but the alarm? Stopped working about 6 months ago."
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"Pros:It is really nice to have the time projected onto the ceilingTemperature on the ceiling is cool tooDisplay shows the time the alarm is set for without having to push any buttonsDisplay shows indoor temp and humidityCons:It is so small (about 5""x3"") and lightweight (14oz) that it often falls off the table when I'm trying to snooze in the early morningCheap plasticy feelAlarm is not loud at all - barely wakes me upThe display is not lit so there are times when it's too dark to see the display and too light to see the projection on the ceilingOverall I was very disappointed in this alarm clock. It is not a quality product"
3,Good alarm clock...,"It is a pretty cheap alarm clock considering all the features it has. The snooze button is on top, but behind the main frame, which causes me to miss it when I try to hit it.My wife didn't like it, because she only wants to see the time projected on the ceiling. It projects the time and then it switches to the outside temperature. I believe it does this every 5 seconds."
5,Excellent Product,"I received this product as a Christmas gift for 2008. I liked it so much, I decided to give it as a gift to my son. it is accurate, unobtrusive and great for the bedroom. If you are at all interested in this type of product, this is the product to buy."
2,Bob's new clock,The buttons/switches are second rate. Caused lots of confusion when setting up the clock. The remote sensor seems to wander around by about 4 degrees from time to time. Despite this I am having a ball with it. But I am not sure I would tell my friends to buy one. Better remote and better buttons and you would have a first rate device.
2,Had trouble with this one,"This clock arrived in working order but after a few weeks the outdoor temp stopped displaying. So I went to the website to look for troubleshooting help. I followed the directions for a restart but the clock never came on again. To be honest, this was probably a lemon since my early model of this worked fine until I lost the external temperature sensor. I find these models can be difficult to set up but ultimately are a great clock (usually). I returned mine and will probably go back to the version I used to have."
4,A Good Buy,"I bought this unit after another brand I had for almost ten years burned out. I like it a lot.PROS:- very lightweight- takes up little space on the counter- projected light is red so it's not too bright on the ceiling- easy to read- easy to set- My old unit's projector was on A/C power, but the rest of its functions were on battery 100% of time. Weird! This unit is truly all A/C w/battery back-up.CONS:- It alternates between time & temperature instead of just showing both at same time.- Inside temperature is not projected.- Projection only shows at four angles: 0, 90, 180, 270. My old unit had full 360-degree rotation to ANY angle.- Projector's OFF switch only works if the unit is on battery power. If it's plugged in, you cannot shut it off."
1,Terrible projection,"The power of the projection light on this is terrible.Pros:-lots of info on the display-outside temperature sensor that communicates wirelessly with the baseCons:-really terrible projection quality-requires AC power, no battery optionI had purchased this thinking that I would use it as a projector at night in my bedroom, boy was I wrong. I returned it within a few days, but was REALLY disappointed at how it only could project a foot or two away, and not 6 feet up to the ceiling. I guess it is the cheapest model, so that makes sense, but not much of a projection clock."
3,Projector light too weak to see,"I was looking for a clock that I can check time without sitting up and turning around in the early morning. Most battery operated wall clocks are hard to see in shadow. The laser projection from a powered clock to a wall and ceiling is a great idea. However, the implementation is really disappointing. You cannot see the projection unless the room is very dark in the night. I saw some similar comments earlier but wanted to have a try. It proved to be true and become useless for me. I already have many regular clocks in home. It is a toy clock for my kid now."
1,And I thought LaCrosse was a quality name brand,"Before I purchased this item, I read all the reviews. I read more positive reviews than negative. This item is a cheap, cheeszy, unreliable clock. We could not get the projection to work. The outside case is very light weight and not worth the money. Amazon was great and gave us a credit after we returned the clock."
2,doesn't really stand up well,"I've had this thing for a while, and it still works fine. It can tell you the time and the temperature in a decent manner. However, the design sort of sucks. It's really easy to tip over. It's made of light plastic and it's narrow and it's balanced poorly. As for the fancy projection, and this may seem asinine to point out, you can't read it when it's bright out. I made this mistake, thinking hey, I can read the time while laying in bed."
1,"Do not buy, this item is not worth the money","got this item last year for family member as x-mas present, it was small and cheap looking and did not work, had to return it."
3,So-So,"Pros:* Projection display perfect. Bright enough to see, not bright enough to disturb.Cons:* Outdoor temperature is wildly inaccurate seems like +/- 10 degrees of actual temperature). Often doesn't get a signal even though the thermometer unit and the clock are less than 6 feet away!* Buttons have to be pressed very hard which makes it difficult to ""snooze"" or turn the alarm off. You have to pick up the unit and hold it to push the buttons, which isn't so great when you are half asleep and trying for another 10 minutes.*Manual is skimpy and doesn't cover many of the buttons... still don't know what the one with arrows is for."
4,Love the Projection on the Ceiling,"I think this alarm clock is hard to understand how to work it - but I think that's because it's more high tech. But, I love how it automatically figures out what time it is once you put in the time zone.Also, I love how easy it was to install the temperature reader on my house and that it projects the outside temperature as well as the time on my ceiling. And to be honest, I love the proection on the ceiling so much, it was worth the money just for that."
5,Gift Receipient Love It!!!,I bought this item as a gift and he set it up and loved it. He said it worked great. No problems at all.
2,Fewer features than you would like,Projection alternates between time and temp. Why can't you set this to just display time. Even the base does not display the date. We have La Crosse unit that is not limited this way. I apparently bought the wrong one. It does work however and recognised my existing outdoor sensor for the other clock. This is a nice feature if you want more than one La Crosse clocks with outdoor temp.
5,Morning time & temp,The La Crosse Technology WT-5120U Projection Alarm Clock with Outdoor Temperature replaced a radio alarm with projection. Having the atomic clock keep the time every day is helpful. The projection alleviates having my wife lean over to see what time it is. Knowing the temperature when awaking in the morning helps with the choice of what to wear.This a great little Alarm Clock.
3,You get what you pay for,"It's a decent clock. For the price it really isn't bad, but if you have high ceilings, or you're someone who likes to fall asleep with a TV on, the projection will be rather hard to see (unless you project it on a wall beside your bed, where it'll shine in your eyes all night.) Also, the outside thermometer is somewhat accurate but rather optimistic.If you're looking for a powerful projection, look towards Oregon Scientific."
4,Surprised,"I was completely surprised to see how well the projection works. We have slanted ceilings in our bedroom, I thought we would have had to use it on the wall because of the angle, but the projector is directional and it is pretty strong so I get a pretty clear picture, though distorted because of the ceiling angle.In works great.The alarm is not jarring. Which is good and bad at the same time. I mean you hear it, but if really got your drunk on and had to get up the next day early...you might sleep though."
3,I WOULD PURCHASE BETTER QUALITY NEXT TIME,"HAD NO TROUBLE SETTING THE CLOCK BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SET THE OUTSIDE TEMP, WHICH IS THE BIG REASON I PURCHASED THIS CLOCK. THE CLOCK IS VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND MY CAT HAS KNOCKED IT OFF THE TABLE SEVERAL TIMES. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PROJECTION ON THE CEILING. IT IS VERY EASY TO READ."
1,Laser display not adequate,"The whole reason I bought this was to be able to project the time on a wall or ceiling. With that being said, the laser is completely inadequate and barely visible for me during most of the hours of the day or night. I suppose it will be fine for anyone who can really make their room very dark at night.Furthermore, there is apparently no way to get the laser to stop rotating between displaying the temperature and the time. It would be nice to have this ability to ONLY display the time, since I'm not going to be using the temperature guage at all.Like others, I would recommend spending a little more money and getting a better product."
1,UNHAPPY,"Very dissatisfied with LaCrosse Technologies. The item did not work properly, after over two and half weeks of E-mails back and forth,I was given a order number to return the item. That was 3 weeks ago and have heard nothing from them. Numerous attempts to reach them by phone have been to no avail."
2,Expected it to last longer,"To whom it may concernI recently purchased this clock for the temperature readings, but mainly for the laser projection at night when its all dark. This thing lasted about 10 days b4 the laser stopped projecting, without any warning or damage it just stopped, so in the dark the clock in now useless.I wonder how long b4 it stops working altogether."
3,Not the best I've had but...,"The La Crosse Technology WT-5120U Projection Alarm Clock with Outdoor Temperature is nice for the price. It has a lot of features that I would probably have to spend extra for in an Oregon Scientific alarm clock.My biggest gripe: The buttons are not sensitive enough. It takes me a good 10 seconds to shut the alarm off in the morning because the alarm or snooze buttons do not register the pressure of my finger (or fist ;)).Otherwise, time and outdoor temperature seem to be working okay. I think the indoor temperature is fine as well, but the humidity seems a little high. The projection works fine, and is not too bright. I don't even notice it at all when it's on, which is how it should be (there's no glare).I would recommend this alarm clock to anyone who wants an atomic clock with the option to run on batteries (great for areas with frequent power outages) without paying a lot of money."
1,Poor quality,I was really excited when I read all the features of this product. When it arrived I was a little disappointed in the quality. When I actually started using it the disappointment only increased. You can barley see the display even when the backlight is on. The snooze must be pressed several times for it to work. And the projection alternates between time and temp. This is very annoying. I really tried to give it time to grow on me but after a week I was about to throw it out the window. For about the same price I found another alarm clock with many more features and better quality.
4,GOOD FOT THE MONEY,ONLY ONE THING WOULD MAKE THIS A FULL FIVE - BE ABLE TO SEE THE TIME FORM THE BASE NOT JUST FROM THE PROJECTION.
4,Good Product for Good Price,"This product works great for the price. When I got it I was having a hard time for the plug to work. I called the companies Tech Dept and within seconds he had it resolved. Was nothing wrong with it, just user error. =P Have had it for a couple of months now and have had no problems at all.October 2007: After a few more weeks, I unplugged the clock to rearrange the bedroom. Upon pluging it back in the projection did not work and has not functioned since. Did not last very long."
2,Not great for the money.,"I regret this purchase. This clock has a very, very low projection beam that barely makes it to my ceiling from my bedside table. It's definitely not readable if you have diminished eyesight and aren't wearing glasses, as is the case with better models.Even more troubling, the atomic clock part seems to set itself to random times in the middle of the night.On the positive side, the temperature reads accurate and it's nice to have both inside and outside temps in a cheaper model."
3,Projector alarm clock,"The clock had an initial problem locating the outdoor temperature sensor. That took several days for some reason, but once detected it worked fine. As with most of these clocks it is easily read in the dark, but once daylight arrives you need to actually look at the face. Having a humidity indicator was nice and the way it cycles between time and temperature on the ceiling is appreciated. Since I live on the east coast the fact that it automatically aligns with eastern time is good, but moving it to another time zone is simple."
2,Projection weakness,"I expected a more robust projection of the time on the wall/ceiling. If there is any light at all in the room, the projection is not readable."
2,Project clock,"Not a very user freindly product. Unlike other similar products, the projection display is unidirectional."
5,projection alarm clock,absolutly love this item so nice to even without glasses at night look up & see time & temp.!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,LOVE THIS TIME ON THE CEILING /TEMP CLOCK,"the clock light is not obtrusive, i donot need glasses to see what time it is all during the night........... i enjoy this little jewel."
2,"Projection Works Well, Rest of Features Not So Much","I got this clock for the projection, which works fine. The rest of the clock features are amazingly poorly designed. The buttons are finicky and feel cheap. The base is too small and ill-formed to support the clock well making the clock prone to tipping over. This becomes especially annoying when you try to hit the snooze button (on the top of the unit) only to have the clock flip over forward without engaging the snooze. The other big flaw is that the LCD is largely unreadable in anything other than direct light. This means at night you only have the projection to see what time it is and in the daytime it is often too dark to see the LCD but too bright to see the projection, rendering the clock useless."
2,not what I was hoping for,"Honestly, the projection isn't bright enough to see unless you're in COMPLETE darkness. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,Poor quality clock. Quick refund from Amazon.,This clock was returned due to poor quality. The outdoor sensor never got a signal form the remote temp sensor. The external power source connection required for continuous projection was loose and only made proper connection rarely. The cord was plugged in securely but the electrical connection was poor which caused the display to stop working until you moved the cord around. The projection display when it worked was very dim and could only be seen in a very dark room. I was very disappointed with this product but very pleased with the way that Amazon handled the return.
1,Junk,I've had this clock one year. The time refuses to set itself correctly and the outdoor sensor no longer works.
3,lacrosse clock,I still have not received info on how to have the time continuous on the projecter after following all the instructions I must still use the button to see the time on the ceiling which defeats the purpose of my purchase. Please have someone respond to me.La Crosse Technology WT-5120U Projection Alarm Clock with Outdoor Temperature
1,Didn't work right out of the box,Bought it to replace a previous La Crosse that quit working. This one never even started. I think I'll look for another manufacturer.
2,Not Impressed,"This clock did not suit my expectations. Yes, it did update the time on it's own and reports the temperature in Northern California properly.However, the laser is very hard to see, if impossible, until the sun goes down for good. Past 8AM, I have to strain to see the image if it's projected less than 2 feet from the clock. If it's on the ceiling, forget about it!Plus, they didn't include a constant backlight for the LCD display, so it's all but impossible to know what time it is once the sun starts to rise.Unless you're awake before sun-up every day, don't waste your money."
3,Pretty Cool With Limitations,I've had this clock a couple of weeks now and so far I'm happy with my purchase. But then I went into the purchase knowing the clock's limitations in advance. I have another alarm clock and bought it mainly for the projection feature and it works fine for me. I sleep in a very dark room and it's so nice to be able to glance at the ceiling and decide whether or not to roll over and go back to sleep. I also like the fact the clock displays (but doesn't project) indoor humidity. Very few do that.On the down side: 1) the plug from the AC adapter is difficult to insert correctly. If you don't get it just right it will look like it's in but won't make contact and you'll be running off the batteries. 2) The projector could be a lot brighter. 3) The alarm isn't very loud. None of this bothers me but it may bother others.
4,Not so bad!! La Crosse Technology WT-5120U Projection Alarm Clock,"I got it for my family to make sure room temp is consistatn, time checking, Alarm.Compact and efficient. I like it."
1,Average product,"The outdoor temperature remote stopped working after 7 months of usage. Changing batteries also doesn't help.The clock (set time) adjustment isn't that good either. The same key is for setting the backlight on and also to change the clock from temperature mode to alarm mode.And i seriously doubt whether it has ever synched up with NIST, since i always see the icon there on the clock but the time is way out of synch with my PC clock.Using the Warranty means, bear the shipping expenses to ship the clock to manufacturer."
1,Disappointing,"We've had several projection clocks over the years. This may be the weakest. Difficult to program. Power cord plug in is loose, causing loss of current and run down batteries. Our ceilings are 12 foot and the projection intensity (even when plugged in and not on battery) too weak to easily read."
4,PROJECTION CLOCK,"We really like this projection clock. It is nice when you wake up momentarily during the night, wondering if you only have 15 min more to sleep or a couple of hours. I had read several reviews concerning focus - everything is fuzzy without my glasses, but I can ""read the time and temperature"" without glasses!"
1,Worthless Proudct ? Bad Merchant,"Alarm is not loud enough. Projection light is to dim. Viewing light to dim. I bought it from a merchant johnenglund that has no return policy. He would not answer my emails and to put in in plain words, He ripped me off."
1,"Opened Packages, Broken or Used Clocks","I am so disappointed. I love this clock - I've had one for years, but I broke mine by mistake while moving furniture around. So I was very pleased to find a replacement at Amazon - and for a great price! When the clock arrived, I noticed the clam shell packaging was stapled together. After I set up the clock, I observed that one digit failed to light up - an obvious flaw. At this point I realized that I had been sent a returned item. So, I returned it for an exchange. When the replacement arrived, I was shocked to see that the clam shell packaging had obviously been opened and glued back together again. And the clock had a major scratch on its face. I cannot describe how disappointed I am in Amazon; I am a long term customer and have not had similar problems before. I would not recommend this clock - not because of the clock itself, but because Amazon seems to be selling used, broken, previously returned merchandise."
2,Unsatisfactory Customer Service/Technical support,"Projection does not work. I send LaCrosse an email requesting support on this issue.As of today, (2 weeks later) I haven't received a reply from them."
2,Great Clock but inaccurate thermometer,"The idea of this product is fantastic, however the accurancy of the thermometer leaves a lot to be desired. After reading other customers' reviews and the difficulties in returning for warranty I am not going to bother attempting to return the defective thermometer sensor.The temperature reads between 6 and 10 degrees above the true temperature.As a projection clock it is a five star product, as a themometer it is a one star due to its inaccuracy."
1,"The ""Frustration-Free"" Packaging Worked Great, and Then . . .","I made the mistake of removing it from the packaging. I didn't get to try all the functions of this unit -- disgust set in too early. 1) It refused to operate on AC power. 2) The projected display was upside-down, with no way to correct. 3) The time would not set automatically via WWV. (I know the signal is strong enough in my house -- I have two other clocks that set fine.) And finally 4) when I called customer no-service, I got a recording asking me to leave a message, and I got the return call two weeks later. By then it had been sent back, and my blessings on Amazon's easy return system."
2,Cant get it to work properly,"I purchased two of these clocks, and wish i would have just gotten one and than returned it.One clock the temp settings dont work at all, we have replaced the remote temp sensor, tried placing both the remote temp sensor and the clock in differant places around the house, and no luck. all that works is the time and the alarm.The second clock works, however the temp/humidity is never accurate. I live in new mexico, we have very low humidity 95% of the time. The display on the clock usually has between 70-90% humidity, and the temp is usually off by about 30 degrees. Right now it is about 42 degrees and very dry outside. my clock reads that it is 69 degrees and 96% humidity. As with the other clock i have moved the clock and the remote temp sensor all over, i have even tried the garage and outside to try to get an accurate reading.On the positive side i am very nearsided, and i can actually read the display on the ceiling at night."
1,Not what I expected......DISAPPOINTING!,"I have bought other La Crosse items but this one really disappointed me. It NEVER would calibrate the outside temperature and it never did sync with the time. I bought this for my husband because of the name brand. Then when we tried getting tech support from the manufacturer, I NEVER got a return email or phone call. I left 2 messages and sent 2 emails. Thanks to Amazon, at least THEY back their products that they sell. Wouldn't buy from any other online site."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS!","This clock is very cheaply made and does not project very well. I sent it back right awayand ordered a different one, different brand."
4,For my dad,The outside temperature is not quite accurate all the time - but they love it! Good purchase. Exactly what he wanted for Christmas.
4,"Useful, fun, great gift","We love our projection alarm clock with outdoor temperature. It is convenient for us to know what time it is when we wake up in the middle of the night and fun to know what the outdoor temperature is. The display, which we have on our ceiling over the bed, is just the right size for us to read and is not too bright to be disturbing (something we were concerned about). Please note that you must read and follow the set-up directions EXACTLY as stated. The time zone setting chart was confusing. We set the zone incorrectly and were repeatedly frustrated. After re-reading the instructions carefully, we saw the note that US time zones would show alphabetical abbreviations as opposed to numerical time zone indicators. We made the change and have had no problems since."
5,does exactly what I wanted,I'll preface this by saying I didn't buy this clock to wake me up or tell me the time during the day. I wanted to easily see the outside temp when I wake up. The time is a bonus but both are displayed (alternately) clearly on my ceiling. The room has to be relatively dark but not pitch black. The atomic clock is scary accurate. New Years Eve it was 2 seconds faster than the count-down shows were showing on tv and I imagine that was a delay in the tv signal getting to me. I'm very happy with this clock and would recommend it.
3,projection size is too small,"I just sent this clock back. I loved the idea of the projection time. However, I needed to put my glasses on to read the time projected onto the ceiling. Not what I want to do at 2am or some other such time. Now granted, I'm pretty blind w/out my glasses. That's why this idea appealed to me. The projection on the 8' high ceiling was about 6-8"" and I couldn't make it out, gazing up at it from my bed.On a good note, the clock has a display backlight function that only works when you press the snooze button. That feature was helpful in keeping the clock from being a source of light, until I needed to see what time it was."
1,DOA,"The unit did not project the time display unless you pressed a button, which is not the way it was supposed to function. I returned it and Amazon gave a prompt and full refund (including shipping charges). I have no complaints about Amazon, just the quality control at LaCrosse (the manufacturer)."
5,La Crosse projection alarm w/Outdoor Temperature,"Great product,easy to set.Shows up nice on ceiling or wall,found the outside temperature to be accurate."
3,Outdoor sensor,"The only con to this unit is the outdoor sensor. I've had two fail. I have it under the eve of my house, not in direct sunlight.Other than that it has worked very well."
2,Dim Dim Dim Display,"The clock works great, the temp is cool, but you can barely see the projector display in lighted conditions. It works great in the dark, but don't count on it projecting more than 2 to 3 feet away."
4,Price is Right,"Bought the La Crosse to replace a unit from a competitor that was about 4x more expensive. The unit does almost everything that the more expensive one did. It has one remote thermometer compared with three, doesn't forecast the weather and the projection is a little less bright. It's smaller size requires that it be placed a little closer to where it's normally being viewed. To be fair, the original was replaced free of charge under the lifetime warranty, taking 2-3 weeks. That was after several years use and no proof of purchase (was a gift). The La Crosse comes with a 1yr. limited warranty.Because I was impatient and the price was so little, I made the La Crosse purchase and it arrived in a couple of days. (Sent out the original after it arrived.) If it lasts as well as long as the original unit it is well worth it."
4,Easy to SEE!!!,"I am so thrilled with this clock/weather station. I am pretty much blind when I do not have my glasses on a got tired of not being able to see the clock when I woke up at night so I purchased this projection clock. It is so easy to see at night and I love the weather feature as well. I automatically know what to dress my children in before I get out of bed! All I have to do is look up and there it is! What a pleasure, This totally makes my life easier and for the price it was totally worth it!!:)"
3,Not bad for the price,Time keeping is accurate; temperature reading is within a degree or two of my other outdoor thermometers. Night projection display is dim. This product is not as pricey as others so one gets what one pays for.
2,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,My clock ..was defective.. and the company..refused to replace the product..I tried all the trouble shooting in the world that they asked me to do.They said I have to pay for shipping .to the company.This is just very pooor customer service .I am never buying this companies product again and will report to BBB.regards
1,Junk Clock,I bought this and sent it back immediately...the clock was smaller than it appeared to me in the pictrue and the clock projection was so dim you could hardly see it more than 1 ft away.
2,"""New"" wasn't new?","When this came to me, the packaging was all messed up. It looked as if the package had been opened before, and then stapled shut again (two staples on the bottom). I ordered this item as ""new."" Even if it hadn't been used, I still didn't appreciate that the item, which I noted on the order was a gift, came in a package that had obviously been opened and then resealed in a hasty, shabby manner. I have to give this as a gift for Christmas, and I don't have enough time to send it back to get another one. I was displeased."
2,Worked great for 8 months then...,"Worked great for 8 months then the outdoor temperature sensor just quit. I changed the batteries in both remote and unit, still does not work. I have 4 atomic clocks from 3 different companies and the outdoor temperature remote quit on all of them! I have used alkaline batteries and lithium batteries and it makes no difference. Does anyone make a unit that lasts more than a year anymore? It seems these units make it past the warranty and then quit."
4,"Good deal, nice price","Overall, a good clock, just what we wanted, but we were disappointed to find that the projected time and outside temp alternate every few seconds - you don't see them at the same time. Unlike the illustration, both time and temp are projected from a single source - not two separate beams like it appears."
2,Projection clock,This clock is ok. I bought it to replace another one which broke. I do not like it as much but it will do.
2,clock is alright...,This clock is lighter than I thought which makes me think that it's a bit cheap. But it works fine so far.
2,too tiny to see,My husband wanted this so he could see the outside temp which does work but the projected image is very small. Only way I can see the time is to put my glasses on.
2,Worked for one year,"I liked this clock except for the issues others mentioned; not back lit, kind of fussy to set up. We ordered it 2/9/09 and it quit working 2/10/10. So we barely got a year use from it. Would not recommend."
4,It's alright...,"I got this product just to replace the clock for my bathroom. It's a great little device and I hardly even use the features it offers. I say, the only features that are helpful on this device is the time (obviously), the indoor temperature, and the display on the wall (works only at night - duh). Getting the device to recognize your time and temperature is a hassle. I spent an hour or so getting it to work and decided to ditch it. I just manually changed the time myself."
1,This Clock is Awful,"Put simply, outdoor sensor didn't work, blue backlight didn't work, did not sync with Atomic clock at all, projection is poor, alarm had to set. Not much to like. Spend $10 more & get a working item."
1,Nice idea bad clock!,"We received this clock as a gift and it was the most frustrating item to get going! First the manual tells you set the time, then you set the time zone. Once you set the time zone the time changes so you have start all over again. The clock has a very weak projection that we could never get to project continuously or get the outside temperature to register. We emailed and called the customer service of La Crosse and it was 4 days before we received an email that gave us a lengthy description of removing the batteries, unplugging the AC adapter, replugging, etc. They also said over 30 clocks were returned for this very thing and nothing was wrong just a bad connection with the AC adapter. To me that means it's faulty. Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return policy because the La Crosse Technology company was absolutely no help whatsoever! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,This is the second type of projection clock I own. The first one is a different brand that I bought at Radio Shack. The only issue I have with this one is the numbers are not very large when projecting on the ceiling. Some of the reviewers have complained about how bright the numbers are but I have no problem with the brightness. I love the fact that it has the temperature as well as the time as my other one is only time. If in the market again I would purchase this product. It was easy to set up right out of the box and does everything it is supposed to do.
5,"It is Great, nay sayers just don't get it!","Yes, the room has to be fairly dark before you can see the display on the ceiling, but that is the whole point; it is made for viewing while in bed in the middle of the night. The clock projects a sharp, in-focus image that is easy to read in a room that has no lights on. When the lights are on, you then read the LCD face of the clock. As the outside temp sensor is powered by flashlight batteries, as they grow weak, teperature readings will become inaccurate, and that becomes pronounced in sub-zero weather. In the winter, put in new batteries. I could never be without one again. I especially like the outside temperature display feature."
2,Weak Projection Toggling Feature annoying,"So I should have read the other reviews first.The ceiling projection is really clear as long as it is very dark, if there is any other light in the room it drowns out the projection, not a big deal, but it would be much better if it was brighter.The biggest issue for us is that it toggles between outdoor temp and time, and you cant turn that feature off. So half the time we look up to see what time it is, it is showing the temp. Who really needs to wake up during the middle of the night to see what the outdoor temp is? But if they do, half the time it will actually be showing the time."
2,"cheap construction, poor design","The outdoor temperature unit has stopped working in just 8 months! I tried changing the battery, following all instructions, but it does not work even if I keep it right next to the clock.The user interface is also bad. Most watches are more easier to use than this clock. I would have expected a clock to be more easier to use as it has more surface for more buttons(if necessary) to be put. When you change the alarm time, you cannot change the time backwards, you have go through the whole cycle (fortunately you do have separate buttons for hour and mins).The buttons don't feel very good.The clock is unstable, it can fall easily.If you won't use the alarm functions, it is probably a good clock while it lasts."
2,Projection clock disappointment,"This clock was great when we first received it. However, the temperature mode stopped after the second week. Then the projection would work off and on, then stopped. Paid too much money to lose it after only a couple of months. Bought a different projection clock from Target and love it!! Has worked now for 6 months, perfectly!"
1,bad choice.,"don't even bother, material is cheap and not worth itI would gone to the movies with what I spent on this thing and it would be more fun."
1,Feel cheated,"I received this clock very quickly. I was disappointed after opening the box. The clock was open box. The product display shows projection for time and temperature both, but the clock I received has only time projection function. It is a totally different model than what I ordered after looking at the picture."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"THIS PRODUCT IS OF POOR QUALITY, HARD TO OPERATE, HARD TO READ DISPLAY. I BOUGHT ANOTHER FROM A DIFF. COMPANY."
2,"Ugh, Stay Away - What a waste of money.","I was utterly disappointed by the atomic clock as a whole. It nevers syncs up except when I keep in on the window aisle. Buttons are hard to use; they either don't press or press and don't do their thing. Projection is pathetic, doesn't work well and is hard to read except when the room is really really dark. It does not have day and date indicators - horrific for any digital clock instead has the option of displaying external weather which by the way is not even close to accurate! The green backlight is not so great either. Hope this helps!"
2,"good idea, low quality","This is an excellent idea product, however very poorly built. The temperature difference is as high as 10 deg F between different sensors. I have two sensors, side by side (two different frequencies, 433 and 915 MHz in a protected area (no exposure to sun or rain) and both show temps 6 deg apart. I recently purchased two clocks and in both cases the sensors did not work. Stayed stuck on 77 F. When contacted CS, had to provide lengthy explanation of the problem, including proper installation steps, etc. In both cases they replaced sensors and they working fine. We have 4 of these clocks throughout the house and nice thing about the sensors is that the work with different clocks, as long as they're the same frequency. The alternative is $79.95 clock from [...]. So, the choice is very easy."
4,La Crosse time and temp projection clock,This unit works great and is easy to operate - AFTER IT HAS BEEN SET UP.
4,Great ceiling clock,"We love this clock. I wish you could turn off the temperature reading and simply do the clock but overall, very happy."
4,Projection alarm clock,"My father in law had told us over and over that he'd like a clock like this, so I purchased it for him last Christmas. It was a bit difficult for him to get set, but once it was, he's really liked it! What a neat find and what a good gift for that person who has ""everything""!"
5,Better than Lasik Surgery!,"Oh my goodness! What an amazing little gadget! I've had the WT-5120U for about a month and it works flawlessly. Now don't get too excited and just plug it in without reading the instructions first. Really neat to see the time and outside temp just floating on the ceiling, as clear as day. I bought it for my wife because she always asked me what the temperature was outside and I couldn't tell her without turning on 1010 WINS first. Now all she has to do is look up to the heavens and VOILA!!! Her quest for the current temperature is right above her! Now you must realize that it won't display when there is too much daylight or a bright room light, but hey, you can still read the display for outside temp, indoor temp and room humidity. Great item!!!"
4,great little gadget,"I love this purchase. It wasn't very expensive and has all the nice features of a pricier brand. The outside tempirature doesn't always display, but I think it's because I have the thermometer mounted in a bad spot."
2,Be wary...,"This clock has a critical design error- must be a malfunctioning atomic time update feature, but this clock will randomly change time by an hour or two. I have been late to work a few times b/c of it and now am on the hunt for just a standard alarm clock. I have done everything the manual says and I was careful to ensure my time zone was correct and everything.Outside of that one critical flaw, yeah it's fine. the projection feature works cool. No other issue."
5,Excellent,"I love this alarm clock. Yes the laser is impossible to see in the daytime, though its so nice to look on the ceiling for the time instead of having to roll over in bed. You also have to put the remote sensor so its not in direct sunlight. Otherwise radiative heat from the sun will cause it to report enormously high temperatures. I keep my outdoor sensor in a bush right outside my window. I love when I wake up in the morning and the outside temperature is projected onto the wall by the laser. This is a great product.Update: Bought this product in 2007, and in 2012, it is still going strong. Great product."
5,this clock rocks!,ive had this clock for 9 months now and i am completely happy. it projects on my ceiling over my bed. Faithfully - allways there changing between outside temp and time. Will never go back to a standard bed clock. I dont use the alarm so i cant comment on that.
5,"Most enjoyable, and it works.","This is one of the more delightful purchases recently. The little unit and its remote temperature sensor came to life shortly out of the box with no hastle and went to work as advertised. The readability of the projection on the ceiling when it's a little darker lighting, curtains pulled, and especially at night is wonderful. The direction of the projection is easily adjusted in several directions. It is easy to adjust and tailor to your environment, keeps the right time, right temperature and just sits there doing its job day in and day out in a most enjoyable way. I bought it as a gift to my wife more as a stocking filler, but neither of us would want to be without it now as we find ourselves depending on it. And it has delivered so far."
3,Low Temperature Inaccurate,"This is a great unit for warm climate use. However, I am not satisfied with the accuarcy when the outside temperature is below freezing. The lower the temperature goes, the more inaccurate the sensor becomes where it can be more than seven degrees off at 0."
1,Customer Support nearly non-existent,"I received the WT-5120U-GB as a gift. It had a problem that should be a warranty matter. A request form on their web site resulted in a reply a month later asking for more information. A month after that a return authorization arrived, then the next day a different model (no outside temp, no projection) arrived. I've given up and now have a Honeywell PCR825W- a larger, brighter projection of time, outdoor AND indoor temp."
3,"Really like this clock, would make some changes though!","Love the projection feature on this clock-it's so nice in the middle of the night to be able to see the time without having to set up and look over my husband. What I don't like, is that unless the room is what I would consider ""very dark"", you cannot see the projection, nor can you see the clock as it is not back lit. The set up is easy enough as long as you follow the specific instructions."
4,Good one for this price,"I bought this projection clock, this is a good one for the price. Working as expected. Display is Ok to see with night lamp. Remote sensor also working well for the outside temparature."
3,"Not bad, but too unstable","Worked fine once I called customer service and was told you need to use the eraser of a pencil to be sure the a/c adapter plug is fully inserted. Display was bright enough to see in dim light, and I liked being able to set the rotation of the projection.However, the clock is not stable enough to set the alarm with one hand. I need to get up at different times throughout the week and set the alarm often. I can't just lean over and set it if I'm already in bed. I have to sit up and hold the clock steady with one hand while setting the alarm with the other. And, if you're sleepy and not careful, it's too easy to change other settings since the buttons share so many functions.Though I like that you can choose to turn on the backlight just when you need to, it is too dim to read the information easily.I'm looking for a more stable clock to replace it."
3,Projection,The clock projection was very dim. The weather doesn't register right. I would not purchase this item if I had read the reviews before doing so.
4,time ane temperature clock,"We love having the time and outside temperature showing on our ceiling at night, Just wish they showed at the same time instead of going on and off separately but still love the clock."
4,Good clock,"This is a functional atomic clock. It is a little small, but the projection feature is interesting. Back-light is good for checking the time in the dark. This clock did not switch to daylight-savings on its own, had to adjust manually. We have not tried the outdoor temperature feature yet."
4,La Crosse,"This product works great and is extremely helpful. I do not have to get out of bed to know what the temperature outside. I also do not have to roll over to see what time it is, it is all transmitted onto my ceiling."
